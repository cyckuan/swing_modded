 _ SF CHRON   By TOM ABATE 
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
The field of gene therapy got a black eye last week when reporters
disclosed that two prominent researchers had delayed telling a
scientific advisory panel that eight of their patients had died
while enrolled in a gene therapy experiment.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That shock came shortly after the University of Pennsylvania
revealed that an 18-year-old man had died as a result of taking a
gene therapy drug. The Food and Drug Administration, the main
enforcement agency on human drug tests, stopped that experiment and
a similar gene therapy trial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these deaths, not even critics want to halt all gene
therapy work. ``Calling for a moratorium would be pulling the
trigger too soon,'' said Paul Billings, a scientist with the
Council for Responsible Genetics, an ethics watchdog group based in
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   But Billings wants the government to exercise more oversight of
gene therapy experiments, in part because the scientists involved
in such tests often start biotech firms or hold stock in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial stakes are so high, academics are starting to
get too secretive,'' Billings said, adding that they may be
reluctant to disclose bad news that could hurt them financially.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the recent episodes involving Jeffrey Isner of St.
Elizabeth's Hospital in Boston, and Ronald Crystal of New York
Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Both are trying to cure heart disease by injecting patients with
genes designed to strengthen their hearts. Isner is a major
shareholder in Vascular Genetics, the North Carolina company
sponsoring his trial. Crystal holds stock in GenVac, the Maryland
startup funding his experiment.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, eight of their patients died while
participating in the studies. The researchers say _ and there is as
yet no reason to doubt them _ that all eight patients died of the
underlying disease, not from any gene therapy overdose.
</P>
<P>
   Both scientists promptly reported these deaths to the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently neither scientist filed an immediate death report
with a second oversight body, the Recombinant Advisory Committee.
RAC is part of the National Institutes of Health. It reviews gene
therapy experiments before the FDA approves them, and then keeps
track of ``adverse events'' _ such as deaths _ once they start.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the two scientists flouted the RAC's rules, it is not
clear whether they broke any laws. The RAC will meet in December to
discuss the breach.
</P>
<P>
   Isner denied that his stock ownership had anything to do with
his tardiness in reporting the deaths to the RAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not aware RAC was expecting these reports immediately,''
Isner said, pointing out that he had reported the first death at a
scientific meeting well before this whole flap arose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any intent to conceal anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy differs from other forms of drug development, said
Dr. Estuardo Aguilar, a gene therapist at Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston and an RAC member.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are manufactured. We take them to supply some chemical our
bodies lack. But in gene therapy, scientists inject the patient
with a gene that is supposed to teach the body to produce the
needed chemical from within.
</P>
<P>
   There have been nearly 300 human gene therapy trials over the
past decade, and so far none has achieved a cure. Because it's such
a novelty and affects the entire human blueprint, Aguilar said it
makes sense to have the RAC and the FDA both review experiments in
advance.
</P>
<P>
   But Aguilar said biotech firms have long grumbled about having
to immediately report adverse events to RAC, because the committee
makes such information public, while the FDA keeps death reports to
itself.
</P>
<P>
   When the RAC meets in December to discuss the controversy,
Aguilar said, he will ask whether the advisory panel should
continue asking for _ and publicizing _ every death report.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many patients who have undergone gene therapy studies have
died, but they have died in spite of the gene therapy, not because
of it,'' he said. ``Companies are very concerned because if some
death is reported in a piecemeal fashion, it may have an adverse
effect on their stock.''
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar doesn't know how the 12-member committee will react to
his suggestion, which would mean that only the FDA would get
immediate death reports.
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Billings will certainly oppose any such change.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have situations where scientists are taking equity
positions in companies founded around experimental therapies, you
need more public scrutiny, not less,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ALZA STILL READY TO MERGE: If there was a botched merger
sweepstakes, I would nominate the proposed marriage of Abbott
Laboratories of Chicago with Alza Corp. of Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   On June 21, Abbott, the pharmaceutical giant, said it would
acquire Alza, a local drug discovery firm, in a stock swap then
worth $7.3 billion. Alza shareholders approved the deal September
21.
</P>
<P>
   One week later, Abbott revealed for the first time that the FDA
considered Abbott's diagnostics division in ``noncompliance'' with
federal manufacturing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The parties are in discussions over a proposed consent
decree,'' Abbott said. ``If those discussions are not successful,
the government has advised the company'' it would sue to shut down
Abbott's main diagnostic-device factory in Lake County, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of both firms plunged. Within days, several law firms had
filed an array of class-action lawsuits, charging Abbott and Alza
with defrauding Alza shareholders by concealing the FDA problem
until after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, class-action attorneys asked the federal judge
handling the case to force both companies to turn over any
documents that would show when and what they knew about the FDA's
beef with Abbott.
</P>
<P>
   Alza stunned observers by filing court papers siding with the
classaction lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is uncommon for a defendant to join you in a motion like
this,'' said Steve Toll, one of the attorneys representing
shareholders. ``The judge said that fact swayed him to grant our
motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Alza has not explained its unusual move, which has encouraged
speculation that Abbott may not have disclosed the problem to Alza
during the premerger talks.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Abbott agreed to pay a $100 million fine to settle the
FDA dispute. That is the largest civil penalty ever levied against
a medical product manufacturer. Abbott also agreed to stop selling
certain diagnostic devices until the FDA says its manufacturing is
up to snuff.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott's stock price, and the value of the Alza deal, fell yet
again. Abbott ended the week at $38.50, making the deal worth $6.4
billion _ almost $1 billion less than the value at the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at differently, the exchange rate of 1.2 Abbott shares
for each Alza share means the deal now represents only a 4.3
percent premium for Alza, based on its Friday closing price of
$44.31.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, both companies remain committed to the deal. But
last week, the two firms agreed not to close their merger before
December 30 without holding a second shareholder vote. Such an
agreement would head off the scheduled November 23 hearing to stop
the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Investors don't know whether Abbott and Alza are preparing to
settle with the lawyers to make the classaction suits disappear, or
are looking for a face-saving way to break or renegotiate the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The merger agreement leaves them plenty of wiggle room.
According to Alza's proxy statement, the two firms can agree to
walk away from the deal ``even if Alza's stockholders have approved
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, either firm can ``without the consent of the other,
terminate the merger agreement'' if the deal isn't completed by
December 31.

 _ SF CHRON  
By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine every person, place and thing on the face of the earth
having a Web page. And imagine a world full of wireless consumer
devices that could read those Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   Put them together and you have more information at your
fingertips than you may even want or know what to do with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big Brother'' issues aside, that's the vision of scientists in
HP Labs, 3the Hewlett-Packard think tank that has spent four years
dreaming up new consumer devices and systems to infuse technology
into more segments of daily life.
</P>
<P>
   HP Labs last week unveiled ``CoolTown,'' its Web-centric concept
of a future world, where Muni riders, using a wireless device,
could tap into a bus' Web site to find out how late it was running.
And where a smart alarm clock would access your electronic calendar
and know what time to wake you in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of ``pervasive computing,'' or spreading the use of
computer technology far beyond the computer desktop, is not new.
Companies like IBM, Microsoft, Lucent Technologies, Sun
Microsystems and Xerox are also researching ways to put hardware
and software into appliances like refrigerators, toasters,
telephones and televisions to make them all-seeing, all-knowing,
Internet-enabled information devices.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those companies are trying to create another layer of
new technology _ such as chips, large storage devices and software
_ to connect appliances to the Internet. For example, a small chip
the size of a staple would be embedded in a painting, shirt or
other object and transmit data about the object to a wireless
device.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, HP Labs wants to use existing Web browsers and
servers and wireless transmitters to transmit information. HP Labs
Director Dick Lampman believes that by tapping into existing
technologies, pervasive computing could start to become a reality
in one or two years.
</P>
<P>
   HP's vision would use an open standard technology that's not
dependent on any one company's proprietary devices or software,
even HP's.
</P>
<P>
   But HP would profit from wider use of its Internet servers,
printers and computers. The lab also revealed some details of
research into higher-capacity computer storage devices, including
one that could hold more than one terabit of data per square inch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't see the point in creating a monopoly here,'' said
Jeff Morgan, a scientist working on the CoolTown project. ``We're
able to bring in Web economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said the scientists have even coined a simple theme to
promote their idea: ``Hey, Everything Has a Web-page,' or `HE HAW'
for short.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the scientists are serious about their vision. To a small
gathering of technology journalists, they showed off a
demonstration conference room, which had its own internal Web page
detailing the equipment available.
</P>
<P>
   Using a palm device, researcher Gene Becker called up the Web
address for a printer in the room and printed the Web page for the
room, without having to hook up wires.
</P>
<P>
   He also demonstrated how HP employees, using a desktop or
portable computer, can track the location and read the schedule of
an HP shuttle bus equipped with its own Web site and a Global
Positioning Satellite receiver. In the CoolTown idea, bus stops
would have their own individual Web sites to deliver information
like maps, weather and fare prices.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, a wristwatch could be turned into a wireless
device that could access those Web pages. In a store, a Web-enabled
blue jeans display, for example, could sense an approaching shopper
and offer an instant electronic coupon on the customer's &UR;  &LR; watch.
</P>
<P>
   Parents could use such a watch as a satellite-linked tracking
device for their children or other people. ``When I'm in the mall,
and it turns out my best friend is in Macy's, I can (find her
location on the watch) and go and have coffee with her,'' said
Frederick Kitson, the lab's client and media systems director.
</P>
<P>
   Technology analyst Rob Enderle of Giga Information Group said
HP's concept ``on the surface makes an elegant kind of sense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like someone would have thought of this long ago,''
Enderle said. ``It's easier than creating a whole new protocol.''
</P>
<P>
   Enderle noted that the CoolTown idea could help Hewlett-Packard
change its image from a technology follower to a technology leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the Internet, both Microsoft and IBM have been
much more aggressive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Hewlett-Packard still has to prove that, like any
large corporation, it can allow a simple idea to flourish without
trying to put more of an HP stamp on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hewlett-Packard and `easier' are not typically two things that
come together in the same sentence,'' he said. ``This might be
first real representation of a new HP.''
</P>
<P>
   HP's researchers admit there are a number of potential barriers
before their ``HE-HAW'' concept really takes root. For one thing,
the wireless networks are not widespread yet, Becker said.
</P>
<P>
   And the researchers wouldn't touch the sociological implications
of having everyone wired to the Internet so that a computer would
know when a person sits, stands, walks, talks and buys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are technical issues and there are social issues as
well,'' Becker said. ``That will all be sorted out over time.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Many professional money managers think selecting the right
industry group is more important than picking the right stock.
</P>
<P>
   An industry group is made up of companies in the same or related
businesses _ for instance, grocery stores, computer manufacturers
or oil drillers.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks in the same industry group tend to move together. In
recent months, we have seen surges in the prices of oil, gold,
retail and financial services stocks. When those industries took
off, most stocks in the groups went along.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what the overall market is doing, you will always find
some industry groups moving up, and others heading down. A popular
investment strategy is to pick the strongest stock in a strong
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Here are three Web sites with free tools to help you implement
this strategy:
</P>
<P>
   WALL STREET CITY: Telescan's Wall Street City
(www.wallstreetcity.com) sports an impressive set of industry group
analysis tools. Telescan Inc. of Houston is a public corporation
that has been supplying stock market data and analysis tools for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   From the home page, select Industry Group Center on the
Investment Centers menu to display the Industry Group menu and a
tutorial explaining Wall Street City's approach to industry group
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Select Best &AMP; Worst Industries from the menu to see the entire
list of industry groups sorted from best- to worst-performing for
one day's returns. Unless you're a short-term trader, one day
doesn't mean much, but you can select other periods ranging from
one week to five years by clicking on the corresponding links. I
picked six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the list was ``Retail/stores/mail order-catalogs,''
showing a healthy 28.9 percent return. ``Tobacco/cigarettes''
showed the worst return _ down 31.3 percent in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Click on the industry name to see the stocks in the group,
sorted with the best performers at the top. The best company in the
retail/stores/ mail-order group was Right Start, with a 75.3
percent return. Blair Corp. was at the bottom, losing 21.8 percent
in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   You can research Right Start, or any company, by clicking on the
company name. That displays a price chart for the stock and a
drop-down menu (Select Company Report) listing a variety of
available reports and news sources for the company. Of the 17
reports listed on the menu, four (Company Profile, Macro World
Price Forecast, ProSearch Criteria and S&AMP;P Company Report) require
a subscription. The rest are free. Some are exclusive to Wall
Street City, including two of my favorites: Quick Facts and
Telescan Rankings.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need patience when using Wall Street City; some of the
screens take a long time to display.
</P>
<P>
   MONEY CENTRAL: Microsoft's Money Central (moneycentral.msn.com)
has an easy-to-use feature that highlights the 10 best and worst
performing industries over the past month.
</P>
<P>
   From the home page, select Investor from the drop-down menu,
then click on Top 10 Lists under Markets on the left, and finally
select Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shows you the best and worst performing industry
groups, including the percentage change for each group during the
past month. The results are updated nightly.
</P>
<P>
   When I checked last Wednesday, Health Care Plans was the best
performer, with a 24.5 percent gain, and Cigarettes was the worst,
falling 27.9 percent during the past month.
</P>
<P>
   Clicking on the industry name displays a list of the 10 best and
10 worst performing stocks in the group, also based on one month's
performance.
</P>
<P>
   I selected Health Care Plans and found that LifePoint Hospitals,
a recent spin-off of Columbia/HCA, was the leader _ it soared 52.9
percent in one month. Clicking LifePoint's ticker symbol displays a
current quote and a menu accessing all of the research information
available on the site for that company.
</P>
<P>
   BRIEFING.COM: Briefing.com (www.briefing.com) takes a different
approach. Instead of relying on recent performance, Briefing.com
employs real people to analyze the prospects of each industry.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing.com charges $6.95 per month to see the ratings on their
site, but E-Trade gives it to you free. You have to register, but
you don't have to be an E-Trade customer to see the reports.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing.com refers to industry groups as sectors. From
E-Trade's home page, select Markets on the top menu, and then
Sector Ratings under Analysis &AMP; Commentary near the bottom of the
menu on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing.com covers 26 industries. The ratings are summarized in
a chart at the top. The ratings range from one (outperform) to five
(underperform). Some sectors have both short- and long-term
ratings. For example, 3/2 means the short-term rating is three
(market performer), and the long-term rating is two (slightly
outperform).
</P>
<P>
   Briefing.com provides a detailed analysis of each industry. When
I checked, the only top-rated industries were the Internet and
Telecom Equipment sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco was the only industry warranting a five rating
(underperform).
</P>
<P>
   In an analysis of the industry, Briefing.com minced no words,
saying, ``Expect Philip Morris to end up declaring bankruptcy,''
and others in the field to ``face a similar threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Briefing.com lists all of the major companies in each group, but
only occasionally mentions favorites, and then only in passing. For
instance, it named 17 companies in the top-rated telecommunications
equipment sector without differentiating between the investment
quality of any of them.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings look like they are updated every two or three
months. When I looked, eight sectors hadn't been updated since
August.
</P>
<P>
   Industry group price trends tend to last for months, if not
years. For instance, the banking group was in an uptrend from
January 1997 until early this year. The wine and liquor segment
sector is experiencing a steep uptrend that started around the
middle of last year. Gold mining stocks were in a downtrend that
started in the middle of '96 and lasted until September of this
year.

RANGERS BEAT BLACKHAWKS, 3-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The strategy seemed foolproof: keep the New York
Rangers on the power play and they would not score.
</P>
<P>
   Even if that was not the Chicago Blackhawks' plan, it was
working, at least for the first two minutes of the game. The
Blackhawks took a penalty 8 seconds in. The Rangers, among the
National Hockey League's worst at scoring power-play goals, as
usual, did not tally.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were not awarded a power play for 55 more minutes,
and when they were, they again failed to score. But in between,
they scored three even strength goals and won, 3-1, to snap a
seven-game stretch (0-5-2) without a victory and gain their first
triumph in exactly three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the best 60-minute effort we've had all
season,'' said Ranger goalie Kirk McLean, who stopped 23 shots,
playing in place of Mike Richter.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the Rangers' scores came in the first period _ one by the
rookie Mike York from Theo Fleury, the other by Petr Nedved from
the rookie Jan Hlavac. The third came from Adam Graves, his third
of the season and first in 11 games, on an assist from Fleury,
after the Rangers had sat back for a period and a half and let the
Blackhawks back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That goal released a lot of pressure,'' Rangers Coach John
Muckler said.
</P>
<P>
   With the Rangers slumping and coming in at 5-8-3 for the season,
Neil Smith, the team's president and general manager, was being
openly questioned about Muckler's job status.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers prevailed even though their power play went 0 for 3
and is now 4 for 71 on the season, 0 for 31 on the road and 0 for
its last 29 anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' last victory had come on Oct. 17 against the
expansion Atlanta Thrashers. That was also the last time they had a
two-goal lead. The Blackhawks, meanwhile, have been pathetic on
home ice where they are 0-5-3.
</P>
<P>
   There were huge pockets of empty seats in the United Center in a
contest between two of the worst teams in the league. But there
were two Ottawa scouts present. The Rangers are host to the
Senators on Wednesday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   But Ottawa's deadline for the holdout center Aleksei Yashin to
either sign or not come back this season is Monday. Manny Malhotra
received a little more ice time than usual on Sunday night, leading
to the question whether the Rangers might be showcasing him for a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The play was sloppy, indicative of both teams' shoddy records.
The Rangers sat back on their heels after scores by York and
Nedved. York scored his fourth of the season 5 minutes 9 seconds
into the game, and Nedved got his fourth at 8:58.
</P>
<P>
   McLean allowed only Anders Eriksson's slap shot at 3:45 of the
third to beat him. Graves restored the two-goal lead at 11:17. And
the Rangers, a fragile team to begin with, somehow held on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a start,'' Rangers Captain Brian Leetch said. ``We
still have a lot of work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be careful,'' said Muckler. ``We've won one game.
We should be happy and enjoy it. But Monday, we have to go to work
again.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA was not the place to be Sunday for visitors
in search of championships.
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA women's soccer team prevented USC from clinching the
Pacific-10 title by beating the Women of Troy 3-0. Then in the
second half of the doubleheader at North Athletic Field, Sasha
Victorine scored in the 11th minute of overtime to give the Bruins'
men a 2-1 victory against Cal State Fullerton in a game to decide
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation Pacific Division
championship in front of an announced crowd of 2,962.
</P>
<P>
   By beating the Titans (16-1, 7-0) for the first time since 1996,
UCLA (14-5, 5-2) earned a berth in Wednesday's MPSF final against
Washington, with the winner advancing to a Nov. 14 NCAA play-in.

<P>
   The UCLA women (14-4-1, 6-2-1) finished third in the conference
behind Stanford and USC but solidified their playoff hopes with the
win over the Women of Troy (14-5-0, 7-2), who entered the game tied
for the Pac-10 lead. UCLA and USC both received byes for the first
round of the playoffs, which start Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awesome for us,'' Bruins forward Staci Duncan said. ``We
hadn't been playing well at all. I guess you have ups and downs in
every season, but we had been down. We were worried. This is real
big for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan had several scoring opportunities and provided one of the
biggest plays of the women's game. Following a USC corner kick,
UCLA's Venus James cleared the ball out to Duncan, who dribbled the
length of the field, beating two defenders and going one on one
with USC goalkeeper Shaelyn Fernandes to score in the 54th minute
for a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tracey Milburn assisted Lauren Emblem for the Bruins' first goal
and Krista Boling's header on a corner kick in the 77th minute
provided the final score.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA outshot USC 10-3. Bruins goalkeeper CiCi Peterson did not
have to make a save the entire first half as the UCLA defenders,
who switched from a man-to-man to zone defense up the middle for
the game, dominated the Women of Troy.
</P>
<P>
   The men's game featured a strong defensive showing by both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Scot Thompson headed in a corner kick in the 68th minute
for the game's first goal. Less than two minutes later, Ricky
Melendez took a pass from Duncan Oughton and scored from 10 yards
out to tie the contest. When neither team scored again during
regulation, the game went to sudden-death overtime, where Victorine
slipped the ball under Titans goalkeeper Scott Alexander and into
the corner of the net amid a cluster of players.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us momentum, but most of all it gets the monkey off
our back since everyone says we can't beat Fullerton,'' Victorine
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't deserve to lose,'' said Fullerton coach Al Mistri,
whose team entered the game ranked No. 13, ``but that's the nature
of our game. We came here with an intent to win and we played that
way.''

DOLPHINS SHUT OUT TITANS, 17-0 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MIAMI _ Steve McNair is not likely to doubt the Miami Dolphins'
standing as the National Football League's third-stingiest defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Titans' quarterback was harassed throughout the
game on Sunday night, throwing three interceptions and getting
sacked four times, as Miami won a defensive brawl, 17-0, before
74,109 at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The victory raised the Dolphins' record to 7-1, their best start
since 1990, and dropped upstart Tennessee to 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Miami still has not given up a rushing touchdown this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Sam Madison, who had eight interceptions last season,
hogged Miami's defensive spotlight on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   He was responsible for all of McNair's interceptions, and they
all came on similar plays, where Madison could drop off his deep
coverage and turn to find the football going into his arms.
</P>
<P>
   After two late first-half interceptions, Madison developed an
upset stomach. The third-year pro sat out until two plays before
his third interception, which came late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   He returned this one 29 yards, giving him 115 interception
return yards for the game. It was enough to set up Olindo Mare to
pad Miami's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mare punched through a 46-yard field goal 14 minutes 55 seconds
from game's end for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   For Miami, the injured veteran quarterback Dan Marino watched
the game from the sideline in a long-sleeve, dark blue shirt and
jeans as Damon Huard won his third straight game as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Huard, a third-year pro from the University of Washington,
completed 15 of 25 passes for 210 yards and 2 touchdowns. He had no
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   McNair completed 22 of 42 passes for 205 yards. The Alcorn State
alumnus picked up 47 of those yards on Tennessee's final
desperation drive that reached the Miami 3-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Yet typically on this night, his final pass fell incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans managed 308 yards of offense. Eddie George, the power
back, had the most success, with several sizable runs giving him 65
for the game. His problem: only 14 carries, with Tennessee
struggling to keep the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, averaging just 304 yards and 16 points in Huard's
two starts, began the game like an offensive juggernaut. Huard
found Tony Martin for 16 yards on first down, then Cecil Collins
burst for 12 more.
</P>
<P>
   But so much for a quick personality makeover. Four plays later,
Miami punted.
</P>
<P>
   Derrick Mason went to field the punt and the ball bounded past
him. Miami thought he had touched it and made an official
challenge. It was denied, with Miami losing a timeout as a result.
</P>
<P>
   On Tennessee's second series, the visitors went from their 15 to
the Dolphins' 14 in 10 plays. George ate up 41 yards of it in four
runs. Yet frustration was around the corner. On fourth down, Al Del
Greco's 33-yard field-goal attempt hit the left goal post and
bounced out.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins then mustered their best drive of the game, going
77 yards in 12 plays in a convincing 6-minute-18-second statement
bridging the first and second quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Huard passes of 9 yards to Stanley Pritchett and 29 to Oronde
Gadsden gave the Dolphins good field position, and shortly
thereafter Huard salvaged a broken play impressively.
</P>
<P>
   Jevon Kearse, the Titans' pass-rushing end, stripped Huard of
the ball, but the quarterback scooped it up and threw an
off-balance pass to O.J. McDuffie for 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   That set up Miami at the Tennessee 6. Three plays later, Huard
spotted Pritchett over the middle for the 6-yard touchdown.

   ENGINEERED-CROPS-2TAKES LUBBOCK, Texas _ At the center of
gleaming government laboratories in Lubbock, tucked into petri
dishes nurturing man-made sprouts, coursing through roots of
genetically engineered seedlings, lives an idea.
</P>
<P>
   The idea came from a problem. Corporations are spending millions
to blend genes and make plants impervious to insects and weed
spray, plants that already make the cotton in your T-shirt and the
sweetener in your soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies, though, are worried about farmers simply
stashing away seed from one year for the next spring's planting.
</P>
<P>
   So the idea is simple enough: Just make sure that a plant will
have no offspring. Design the plant for big yields of sterile
seeds.
</P>

   Suddenly, the know-how tucked in a seed would have hard-wired
protection. By SCOTT CANON. Story will move in the ``a'' category.

BIOTECHNOLOGY ENMESHED IN BATTLE OVER PROTECTING RIGHTS TO
GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star   LUBBOCK, Texas _ At the center of
gleaming government laboratories in Lubbock, tucked into petri
dishes nurturing man-made sprouts, coursing through roots of
genetically engineered seedlings, lives an idea.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The idea came from a problem. Corporations are spending millions
to blend genes and make plants impervious to insects and weed
spray, plants that already make the cotton in your T-shirt and the
sweetener in your soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies, though, are worried about farmers simply
stashing away seed from one year for the next spring's planting.
</P>
<P>
   So the idea is simple enough: Just make sure that a plant will
have no offspring. Design the plant for big yields of sterile
seeds.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the know-how tucked in a seed would have hard-wired
protection. Farmers would need to buy fresh supplies each year.
</P>
<P>
   Critics see the idea as a Frankenstein's monster. They warn it
could upset thousands of years of agricultural tradition in an
arrogant attempt to cage biology's driving force _ the need of any
organism to reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   But even some scientists, nervous that biotechnology could loose
unnatural forces into wild, that gene swapping could create
superweeds or corn that kills butterflies, like the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Molecular biologist Mel Oliver hit on the since-patented
inspiration several years ago _ ``It was a scientific brain teaser
I couldn't let go'' _ and now spends much of his time in a
government lab trying to reap an infertile harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about whether this is something we should be doing
given that it doesn't add anything to the farmer's crop,'' said
Oliver at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's lab in Lubbock.
``(But) this is the only way I know of to stop the transfer of
(genetic engineering) into the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   To people like Oliver, the idea _ dubbed ``Terminator'' by its
critics and ``technology protection system'' by its advocates _ is
a leash on biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Today, scientists pluck genes out of organisms _ from viruses to
bacteria to animals _ and insert them into plants to achieve
certain traits. That has led to fears, supported by preliminary
research, that those artificial gene sequences could blow from the
pollen of a genetically modified crop, mate with a wild plant and
create a nearly indestructible superweed.
</P>
<P>
   Terminator, many scientists hope, could stop a bacteria combined
in the laboratory with a wheat plant from teaming with a wild grass
in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sterility,'' Oliver said, ``is an evolutionary dead-end.''
</P>
<P>
   While it may offer protection to the environment _ some people
aren't so sure _ Terminator will be driven by money.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, without Terminator, seed companies find themselves
suing American farmers for setting aside part of their harvests to
plant the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology industry is reluctant to sell genetically
altered seed abroad, where custom and unsympathetic legal systems
don't favor their efforts to prevent farmers from keeping back some
seed.
</P>
<P>
   With Terminator, the biotechnology revolution would be
export-ready and pirate-proof. Seed companies could watch the
royalties pour in for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why many environmentalists detest it. ``It's really a
form of environmental vandalism,'' said Indiana University
biologist Martha Crouch. She worked in the genetic engineering of
plants until she was overcome with fears about the technology
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that somehow you have the right to break the cycle of
life, that goes on from seed to seed from time immemorial, doesn't
make sense,'' Crouch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is immoral.''
</P>
<P>
   Protectionists in Europe have seized on the perceived dangers of
genetically engineered food to keep out tons of American imports.
They are joined by environmentalists for whom Terminator sums up
all their worries about man playing God.
</P>
<P>
   So controversial is Terminator that the company that stands the
most to gain from it _ St. Louis-based Monsanto Co. _ talks now of
shelving it.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto is one the major players in biotechnology. Pending
Justice Department approval, the company is also planning to
acquire Delta &AMP; Pine Land Co.
</P>
<P>
   That seed company's genetically modified bug- and
herbicide-resistant cotton plants account for nearly 60 percent of
the crop grown in the United States. Those varieties are credited
in some circles for winning a war against insects that were on the
verge of chasing cotton out of Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Delta &AMP; Pine Land also shares with the U.S. Department of
Agriculture the patent on Terminator technology. Environmentalists
have feared the merger would mean the bundling of Terminator with
existing biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   That, they suspect, could lead to both environmental and social
problems. Already, seed and agriculture chemical companies are
merging into a larger, more concentrated few. John Ikerd, an
agriculture economist at the University of Missouri, worries that
Terminator technology could help those companies achieve a monopoly
over the world's agricultural gene pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any more powerful economic position to be in
than to control the seed that determines a country's food supply,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That, Ikerd warns, could create a sort of modern-age feudal
system of agriculture, with farmers acting as serfs beholden to
seed companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal a lot with Third World agriculture,'' Ikerd said.
``These are people who are lucky if they can afford to buy the
technology once. But how about some poor devil in Peru or
Bangladesh or whatever? Terminator technology is going to doom his
ability to grow crops the next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Ikerd and others foresee further concentration of the expertise
needed to develop new seeds into companies with a poor record for
serving the needs of Third World farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farmers are going to end up in a real bind, where they'll
be stuck growing what the seed companies make available,'' said
Margaret Mellon, a molecular biologist and attorney at the Union of
Concerned Scientists. ``Farmers won't be independent decision
makers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller Foundation president Gordon Conway told Monsanto's
board of directors in June that his organization, which is involved
in farming in developing countries, was opposed to Terminator. Last
month Monsanto chairman and chief executive officer Robert Shapiro
responded in a letter, saying ``we are making a public commitment
not to commercialize ... Terminator.''
</P>
<P>
   But later in the letter he qualified that position, saying that
use of the technology was being delayed ``until a full airing of
the issues is complete and we have responded publicly to the
concerns that are raised.'' Monsanto's scientists are divided on
the issue. Meantime in Lubbock, Oliver and his colleagues tend to
tobacco plants designed to test the Terminator. If that works, they
will move on to cotton, soybeans, wheat and rice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe biotechnology is our only hope for feeding the
world,'' Oliver said. Terminator, he said, ``will make
biotechnology more and more economically sensible.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Delta &AMP; Pine Land is moving ahead as if Terminator is headed
for market. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger (with Monsanto) has not occurred yet,'' said Harry
Collins, a geneticist and vice president of technology transfer at
Delta &AMP; Pine Land. ``As of right now we're continuing with our
research'' and the company expects to be selling Terminator cotton
by the 2005 planting season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The work goes on, he said, because the theft of seed technology
must be stopped. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, members of a South American delegation visiting
Delta &AMP; Pine Land plots near the company's headquarters in Scott,
Miss., were caught stashing genetically modified cotton seeds in
their pockets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They were trying to do in 10 minutes,'' Collins said, ``what
it took us 10 years to accomplish.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What protects seed company intellectual property could also
defend the environment, said Allison Snow, a plant ecologist at
Ohio State University. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``From an ecological standpoint,'' she said, ``I think it would
do a lot more good than harm'' by reducing the chance that a
genetically engineered plant would pass on traits to wild species. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One school of thought, however, suspects that Terminator could
have the unintended effect of increasing the development of
superweeds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Roundup brand herbicide, a Monsanto specialty that kills
nearly everything green it is sprayed on, does not harm so-called
Roundup Ready crops. That means a farmer can wait for crops to
bloom and spray only once a season, a time- and money-saving
advantage. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roundup Ready crops have been wildly popular in the United
States. That's made the herbicide more popular, too. But it's fed
fears that more farmers spraying Roundup increases the chances for
the emergence of a mutant, but naturally occurring,
herbicide-immune weed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If resistance is out there, and we spray enough herbicide,
we'll probably find it,'' said Michael Christoffers, a scientist at
North Dakota State University who sees Terminator as significant
barrier to the evolution of superweeds. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some critics worry that Terminator crops could cross with wild
plants and spread a generalized infertility through the ecosystem.
Supporters say that couldn't happen because sterile plants, by
definition, can't pass on their genetics. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the possibility of Terminator working well, but not
perfectly. A crop that's 90 percent sterile would probably protect
a biotech company's investment _ although it might let laboratory
genetics escape into the wild _ because it wouldn't be worthwhile
to a farmer to plant seed if only 10 percent of it would
germinate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``To be effective at preventing gene flow it has to be 100
percent effective,'' said Rebecca Goldburg, a senior scientist at
the Environmental Defense Fund. ``(But) it does not have to work
perfectly to provide economic advantage for the company.'' &QL;

LOCAL 911 CALLERS ARE GETTING A RECORDING INSTEAD OF HELP 
</HEADLINE>

 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kansas City, Mo--At least 20 times a day, Kansas Citians calling
911 to report emergencies hear this recording:
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Kansas City Police Department. You have reached
911. Don't hang up. For MAST, call 787-8835; for fire, call
274-2121. Please hang on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past 18 months, an understaffed police dispatch center
has been unable to keep up with the more than 1,300 emergency calls
the center receives each day, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons behind the inability to handle calls include low
staffing _ 40 percent of call taker and dispatcher jobs are
unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they're experiencing:
</P>
<P>
   A near-doubling of the average time it takes to answer 911
calls, from six seconds to 11 seconds. At least one caller had to
wait four minutes after dialing 911.
</P>
<P>
   A 185 percent increase from last year for abandoned 911 calls,
when callers hang up before the recording kicks in, or as soon as
it begins.
</P>
<P>
   A 42 percent increase in misdials and a doubling of the number
of calls from cellular phones, many of which are nuisance calls.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the problems, authorities say they know of no instances
wherein someone suffered an injury or died because of inability to
reach a call taker. Nevertheless, the problem has generated
numerous complaints to city and police officials.
</P>
<P>
   City Council member Alvin Brooks, who founded the Ad Hoc Group
Against Crime, said he has called 911 and gotten a recording and
was put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that has to be addressed to see what we can
do,'' Brooks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know it's bad, but we're taking steps to address the
problem,'' said police Capt. Rick McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Police Board President Jeff Simon said, ``There is a critical
need to do something about it soon. But like so many other problems
we have, it all comes back to money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Police Department answers all 911 calls for the
city and then routes the calls to police dispatchers, fire
dispatchers or the city's ambulance service.
</P>
<P>
   During peak hours, when dispatchers are busy and calls are lined
up, callers can hear the recording telling them to call the Fire
Department or the Metropolitan Ambulance Services Trust.
</P>
<P>
   According to communications records, from January 1999 to
October 1999, about 86,000 callers hung up out of 403,000 total
calls, McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation alarms Matt Gratton, the city's Emergency Medical
System director . After receiving three complaints from the
management of MAST and the Fire Department, Gratton wrote police
commanders in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our concern is that someone in the middle of an emergency may
not be able to remember a number and may not decide to call at
all,'' Gratton said. ``Any time a person is given a recording, it's
a concern.'' Kansas City Maj. Dean Kelly, who oversees the
communications unit, said he has a serious staffing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 37 call takers and dispatcher positions are vacant
out of 91 slots. The department has used overtime to compensate for
the vacancies, but emergency callers are still hearing the
recordings. Eleven new call takers will start work Monday, which
Kelly said could help mitigate the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they need more workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may get 300 applicants, but we're lucky if we get 15 who
are qualified,'' Kelly said. ``And while those 15 are waiting to
get hired, five of them end up getting other jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Late hours and pay are factors in retention, Kelly said .
</P>
<P>
   The day shift is manned by employees who have seniority. That
means new employees must work from 3 a.m. to 11 p.m. or from 11
p.m. to 7 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you've got to work holidays,'' Kelly said. ``And right
now, you've got to work mandatory overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Oct. 31, call takers and dispatchers in Kansas City
started out making less than dispatchers in three other nearby
cities _ $10.50 an hour. Last week, starting hourly pay increased
to $11.88.
</P>
<P>
   In Overland Park, Kan., communications officers start at $12.19
an hour; in Independence, call taker/dispatchers start at $11.84
per hour; in Kansas City, Kan., dispatchers start at $11.34 per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly said dispatchers also can get better-paying jobs in other
fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's job market, it doesn't pay more than a job for an
airline employee who doesn't have to work holidays or weekends,''
Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   The salary range does increase the longer the employee stays on
the job. ``But we have very few call takers or dispatchers who stay
beyond three or four years,'' Kelly said. To address the delay
callers experience, the department has signed up employees to
answer incoming 911 calls exclusively. Two of the employees will
work each shift beginning Nov. 16, focusing only on directing calls
to the proper place, either police, fire or ambulance. ``Hopefully,
that will eliminate people getting that recording,'' Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that the most critical calls, those for medical
help, can get routed faster if they don't have to get in line
behind police calls, some of which are nuisance calls.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said he took a complaint from a caller recently who
was upset that his wife was put on hold after trying to report a
prowler. She hung up after getting the recording. McLaughlin said
they found out she called at the same time that seven cellular
phone callers were reporting a car fire. While call takers were
taking those calls, she was on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Cellular phones also can contribute to crowding of 911 lines. If
a cell phone user calls 911 for help with, say, a flat tire,
someone calling to report a shooting could be put on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Educating the public about when to use 911 could help alleviate
some problems, Kelly said. He said building fires can draw 40 calls
to 911, tying up the lines. He expects more problems next month
when the area introduces 10-digit telephone calls. Kansas' area
code of 913 is similar to 911 and he predicts a spike in misdials.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department is working with Southwestern Bell and the
Mid-America Regional Council to try to head off complications.
Simon said the Police Department is looking at long-term solutions
to the problem, including waiving the city's residency requirement
for the job to attract more applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Simon said he'd also like to put dispatcher and call-taker jobs
at the top of the list when it comes time to adjust pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to simply make our case and hope the City Council will
appropriate it,'' he said. ``It's an urgent need. There's no
question about it.''

CLOCK CONTROVERSY BURNS UP GALAXY
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Nearly an hour after the Dallas Burn added another
chapter to its incredible season, there was Galaxy coach Sigi
Schmid and assistant coach Ralph Perez sorting out the confusion
after a disheartening 3-2 shootout loss at the Cotton Bowl on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas outscored the Galaxy 4-3 in the shootout to even the
best-of-three Western Conference final series at 1-1. The two teams
will meet again Thursday at the Rose Bowl to decide who will play
for the MLS Championship on Nov. 21 in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy striker Carlos Hermosillo scored twice to give the Galaxy
one-goal leads, but Dallas' Ariel Graziani matched him with two
goals, tying the match 2-2 in the 73rd minute to force the
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where the confusion began.
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo gave the Galaxy a 2-1 lead in the shootout with one
Dallas shooter remaining _ Jorge Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   With only five seconds to get off a shot from the 35-yard line,
the clock mysteriously stopped with .38 left _ nearly a half-second
before Rodriguez got off his shot on the television replays.
Rodriguez dribbled away from Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin Hartman,
losing valuable time, but the goal was allowed despite an emotional
plea from Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you do enough of these things, you can sort of tell
time,'' said Hartman. ``You see (the Galaxy's) Cobi (Jones) go
around the keeper, he sprints, he touches it and still barely gets
it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed he (Rodriguez) kind of cruised up, was waiting to
take a shot and I was like, `Man he's got to be almost out of
time.' Then he takes another touch and pushes it 4 or 5 yards wide
and then hits it in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea how they could say he got it off, but at the
same time, this is why I hate the shootout.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's Paul Caligiuri and Dallas' Oscar Pareja each scored
to keep the shootout alive, but when Danny Pena missed his attempt,
Graziani scored the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who jumped on the team bus to look at a replay of
Rodriguez's goal, came back with a disgusted look.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was wrong when it first happened,'' said Perez.
``We tried to protest it then, but the referees wanted to hear
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I timed it four times and at best, it took him 5.2 seconds to
get off that shot. This is the reason the shootout is a hideous way
to decide a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy had 48 hours to file a formal protest, but Galaxy GM
Sergio Del Prado said the Galaxy will not pay the $2,500 fee _
partly because the MLS ruled the play a judgment call, which is
basically not subject to a protest.
</P>
<P>
   __ Columbus 5, D.C. United 1: The Eastern Conference series is
also even after Stern John scored three times and the Crew snapped
a six-game losing streak to visiting United. The series finale is
Saturday at RFK Stadium in Washington D.C., where United has won
all 12 meetings against the Crew.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HERE we go again.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the two States, Florida and Penn, had stayed safely
unbeaten, the situation shaped up nicely. Because they at least
seemed to be clear-cut Nos. 1 and 2 in all the land, no matter how
much squawking might have emanated from the plains of Kansas, the
Virginia piedmont or the piney backwoods of Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   The Nittany Lions vs. the Seminoles made for a perfect
heavyweight championship bout in the Nokia Sugar Bowl. North vs.
South. Old-guard conservatism vs. the glitz of the nouveau riche.
Joe Pa vs. Bobby B., two titans of their profession, each with a
different way to skin the proverbial cat.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been a dream matchup. So clean. So neat. So tidy.
So symmetrical.
</P>
<P>
   Now, so dead.
</P>
<P>
   Since Penn State (9-1) failed to beat Minnesota on Saturday,
succumbing in maddening fashion on a last-second field goal, it's
all potentially one big, ugly mess again. Perhaps the biggest mess
ever, what with four major-conference teams still undefeated
entering the season's homestretch and a slew of others lurking in
the underbrush with just one defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Nebraska (8-1) might knock Kansas State (9-0) from its
pristine perch in the Big 12 this weekend, and you must assume
either Florida (8-1) or Tennessee (7-1) will put a quick end to 8-0
Mississippi State's pipe dream in the SEC Championship Game, if
Alabama or Mississippi doesn't bring an abrupt end to Jackie
Sherrill's run first. Fine. Then what?
</P>
<P>
   Do we send the Virginia Tech Hokies, currently 8-0, to New
Orleans arbitrarily, dismissing the protests of perhaps more worthy
teams with one loss? Does anyone honestly believe these pokey
winners over West Virginia on Saturday _ they, too, required a
field goal at the final gun _ are clearly superior to, or more
deserving than, the Vols or Nittany Lions simply on the basis of
record?
</P>
<P>
   And suppose Miami's Hurricanes do the Hokey Pokey on the
Techsters' helmets, whisking them from the ranks of the undefeated
as well. Of course it could happen. Then we might have Florida
State and a number of arguably worthy Superdome opponents for the
Seminoles, each carrying the baggage of but a single defeat, to
choose from. Wouldn't that be a laugh riot?
</P>
<P>
   Also, lest I forget, who has the temerity, or audacity, to tell
an undefeated Marshall team, owner of the nation's longest active
Division I-A winning streak at 13 games, that it doesn't have a
right to step up and also take its shot?
</P>
<P>
   Stop me if you've heard this before, but this is no way to
determine college football's national champion. The Bowl
Championship Series remains a scam and a sham. In the quest to
identify the No. 1 team, it makes no more sense than flipping
coins, drawing straws or plucking random names from a hat.
</P>
<P>
   No ``system'' that works only by sheer accident is defendable.
Hey, we're smart, people. We can do better. We won't, of course,
any time soon because self-interests and hidebound thinking persist
in the name of tradition, but we can.
</P>
<P>
   Might I explain how again?
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of football and its season, bracketed as it must
be into the fall semester at most universities, places limitations
on the size of the playoff bracket. A 32-team draw, while
desirable, would be impractical without major overhauls in
scheduling. Sixteen, however, is a workable number and would allow
for the inclusion of anyone with a remotely reasonable chance of
actually winning a national championship.
</P>
<P>
   You launch the party on the first weekend in December, including
both the Big 12 and SEC championship games among the eight
matchups. As it now stands, the losers of these games would never
be considered for the BCS biggie anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the normal Christmas break would ensue, with the Elite
Eight subsequently pairing off in the four current BCS bowls around
the New Year, replete with all the normal trappings (parades,
parties, etc.). The first-round losers would, meanwhile, have
returned to the pool from which the other bowls select their teams.
</P>
<P>
   College football's final four would follow seven to 10 days
later, depending on the calendar, with the title game always held
during the off weekend before the Super Bowl. Most schools don't
resume classes until late January anyway, so the disruption to the
academic calendar would be minimal, as if anyone at the
participating institutions other than the egghead professors would
raise a peep of protest.
</P>
<P>
   Where to play the three extra games? Rotate them among the same
four BCS sites. Whatever complications result figure to be more
than offset by the windfall dimensions of the additional revenues,
which could be shared equally among all Division I-A members for
non-sports purposes.
</P>
<P>
   And the end result would be fully validated. The only place you
should be able to claim a championship is on the playing field.
That seems such a simple concept to grasp.
</P>

GALLOWAY'S RIGHT ABOUT ONE THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Now that a court agrees with the Justice Department
that Microsoft is more crooked than a road in the Alps, maybe Joey
Stayaway is smarter than he appeared during his moronic holdout.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to get back to town while Paul Allen's checks still can
be cashed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Seahawks owner's wad is mostly in Microsoft stock,
Stayaway might have deduced that the busting of Bill Gates' chops
Friday meant that the stock price would plunge.
</P>
<P>
   A foolish assumption, of course. But Stayaway has made so many
foolish assumptions that his business logic has to be considered as
soft as his game.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed he was the best wide receiver in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed he had leverage.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed that Mike Holmgren would cave during negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed that the Seahawks couldn't thrive without him.
</P>
<P>
   He assumed his agent knew what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, on all counts. Just like Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   He may have also assumed he would be welcomed back. On that
count, he is correct, presuming he rejoins the team Monday as he
has indicated. His teammates will embrace him, because he may the
finishing touch on an entirely unexpected surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll welcome him back with open arms,'' Cortez Kennedy said.
``He made a business decision that we wish he didn't, but nobody
will hold it against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he is buying dinner. For all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   And the fans will embrace him too. Oh, they'll offer up the
ritual perfunctory boos on his initial appearances, but as soon as
he hauls in a touchdown pass or returns a punt all the way, it will
be kissyface just like old times.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the immediate and eventual hugs, Stayaway has thrown
away half a season and its salary, plus $210,000 in fines. Perhaps
more importantly, he has lost the trust of his mates in a team
sport where self-sacrifice is cherished ``He's not a guy that many
players will go out of their way for,'' said one in the Seahawks'
camp. ``Players will lay down their bodies for some guys. He's not
one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren described Stayaway's persona another way in his
post-game news conference.
</P>
<P>
   The coach/GM talked about Stayaway's potential return _
nothing's confirmed, he cautioned _ by saying there were a number
of logistical matters to be dealt with. Such as?
</P>
<P>
   ``Making sure his helmet fits,'' he said. As the chuckles grew,
he worked up a mock anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now some of you took that the wrong way,'' he said. ``Shame on
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Stayaway's ego will require a high-tech containment field if
he's to be more asset than liability. Fortunately for the Seahawks,
that problem will become apparent only in bad times.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, times are better than they've been in a decade here.
At a division-leading 6-2, after slapping the woeful Cincinnati
Bengals 37-20 Sunday in the Kingdome _ perhaps the most tedious
victory in club history _ some will argue that the Seahawks have no
need for the world's greatest flag football player.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is tackle football, a style Stayaway has only
reluctantly accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But the Seahawks do need him.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the offense has come this far, with a young
quarterback, damaged offensive line and a patchy, slow receiver
group, all under a new system, is remarkable _ and hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the success is owed to an NFL whose mediocrity spans the
fruited plain. The Bengals, for example, with 16 penalties for 107
yards, apparently know less about the NFL rules than George W. Bush
knows about foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the success is due to Seahawks defense and special
teams, which Sunday set up the offense at the Cincy 30-yard line
twice, each time producing a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, however, the Seahawks will run into a quality,
balanced team that will have some answers, even if it may not
happen until the playoffs. It's altogether reasonable to expect
that defenses in the second half will smarten up on the Seahawks
offense, particularly with six AFC West matches among the final
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Stayaway has something no Seahawks receiver brings to the game _
speed that warps defensive game plans.
</P>
<P>
   The Bengals flashed that weapon in Seahawks faces when receiver
Carl Pickens ran a simple fly route past Willie Williams for a
75-yard touchdown bomb, the Bengals' only meaningful score.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks have a passel of respectable receivers, but no Road
Runner to ripple the Kingdome rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to add another dimension,'' said receiver Mike
Pritchard, one whose catches may decline with Galloway's return.
``A lot of people will welcome him.''
</P>
<P>
   It may take him weeks to get his conditioning and timing, but it
looks more and more as if the Seahawks will tack on a week or two
onto the end of the regular season. And those are the games where
difference-makers become game-breakers.
</P>
<P>
   The man walked out on his teammates and a valid contract. But in
the NFL there is little time for or interest in moral dilemmas.
Joey Stayaway soon will be Joey Galloway again, and it doesn't
matter that he lost his fight and looked like a fool.
</P>
<P>
   It's scoreboard, baby. Leave the talk of virtue and honor at the
church door.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
GEEZ, at the rate they're going, it will probably take those
babbling heads at ESPN until the start of the new millennium to
count down their list of the 20th century's 50 greatest athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Who has time for that when you're making New Year's Eve plans?
</P>
<P>
   So in the interest of saving time _ and not getting into the
debate of whether Secretariat and Dennis Rodman should be
considered in the same category as humans _ we're here to give you
the top 30 Texas pro athletes of the '90s. Each must have some kind
of Texas background in individual sports or play for a Texas team.
</P>
<P>
   30. Sam Cassell _ Sure, we have a sweet spot for Smilin' Sammy,
the Fresh Prince of Clutch City. But why not?
</P>
<P>
   29. Billy Wagner _ Guarantees: death, taxes and Wagner in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   28. Ray Childress _ Made four trips to the Pro Bowl and was a
quiet pillar of strength for the Oilers' defense even through Jerry
Glanville's cartoon reign.
</P>
<P>
   27. Jason Kidd _ A baby who was thrown out with the bath water
in one of the Mavericks' many purges.
</P>
<P>
   26. Warren Moon _ Yes, we remember all the playoff failure. But
the numbers say he'll merit Hall of Fame consideration _ if he ever
retires and becomes eligible.
</P>
<P>
   25. Joe Nieuwendyk _ Conn Smythe Trophy winner was instrumental
in bringing the Stanley Cup into the heart of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   24. Charles Barkley _ Justifiably named one of the top 50 NBA
players of all time, he's produced the numbers in his first three
seasons with the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   23. Larry Allen _ Protects Troy Aikman and clears holes for
Emmitt Smith on his way to a bronze bust in Canton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   22. Charles Haley _ Not one you'd invite to the house for a
barbecue, but he jumped from the 49ers and anchored the Cowboys'
defense through a pair of Super Bowl runs.
</P>
<P>
   21. Payne Stewart _ Former SMU Pony was a two-time U.S. Open
champ before tragedy took him.
</P>
<P>
   20. Michael Irvin _ ``Do you know who I am?'' In or out of a
motel room, you had to notice what he did.
</P>
<P>
   19. Sheryl Swoopes _ Women's Player of the Year and MVP of the
Final Four at Texas Tech, she is half the reason the Comets have
forged a WNBA dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   18. Cynthia Cooper _ The top half of the Comets' one-two punch
has all of the trophies and honors, but more important, the drive
to compete and will to win that make her a female Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   17. Bruce Matthews _ If there was a reason to keep the Oilers in
Houston, he was it. Named seven times to the Pro Bowl, he could
well be the greatest offensive lineman of all time. Still going
strong in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   16. Deion Sanders _ The Rev. Do-Rag has had more different
stripes than a herd of zebras but is the best at what he does.
</P>
<P>
   15. Clyde Drexler _ Didn't return home until the end of his
career but did it with a championship flourish. If only the Rockets
had drafted him in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   14. Nolan Ryan _ Was still throwing no-hitters in his fourth
major-league decade and became a deserving first-ballot Hall of
Famer.
</P>
<P>
   13. Ivan Rodriguez _ An All-Star performer at the plate and
behind it. Add in his stamina, and he's putting together a Hall of
Fame resume.
</P>
<P>
   12. Craig Biggio _ An All-Star catcher who became an All-Star
second baseman in a heartbeat and still plays with the joy and
intensity of a Little Leaguer. This is how you play the game.
</P>
<P>
   11. Tim Duncan _ He gets to lead the second 10 because we're
assuming he'll be at the top of the list for the next decade. In
one year won a title and became the best player in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   10. Jeff Bagwell _ Intense, sometimes brooding slugger whose
numbers have been held down by the Astrodome. Underrated for his
glove work at first base.
</P>
<P>
   9. Mike Modano _ The star of the Stars, who rose to the occasion
to win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   8. Juan Gonzalez _ Gone now, but not before winning two MVP
awards for the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   7. Lance Armstrong _ Beat the world's best cyclists and cancer.
Enough said.
</P>
<P>
   6. David Robinson _ An officer, a gentleman and now a champion
who was finally rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   5. Emmitt Smith _ Keep writing him off, and he keeps moving
toward the top of the NFL career rushing list.
</P>
<P>
   4. Michael Johnson _ The running machine finally got Butch
Reynolds' 400 record this year.
</P>
<P>
   3. Carl Lewis _ His prime was a decade earlier, but his Olympic
longevity through the '90s was astounding.
</P>
<P>
   2. Troy Aikman _ Not flashy, not fancy. Just the engine who
drove the Super Bowl machine.
</P>
<P>
   1. Hakeem Olajuwon _ MVP and two-time champ who Wilt and Russell
said was both a throwback and next-generation center at the same
time. The Dream. The best.

BIG VICTORY LEAVES SEAHAWKS ALONE ATOP AFC WEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The last thing the Seahawks wanted to do Sunday was
play the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Six days after an emotionally and physically draining victory
over the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field. Amidst rumors and
reports that leading receiver Joey Galloway will rejoin the team
this morning. On a day when everyone expected them to handle a
Bengals team that was 1-7 and had been outscored 72-20 in its past
two games.
</P>
<P>
   All the ingredients were there for a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   But not an upset. The Seahawks stormed to a 31-10 first-half
lead in the Kingdome and coasted to a 37-20 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough week,'' Seahawks guard Brian Habib said. ``It
is very difficult to come back after a huge win on Monday night and
be as sharp as you were that game. Emotionally, physically, it's
very difficult. You've got one less day to prepare. You've got one
less day to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's bound to be some dead spots,'' he said. ``But we were
lucky we came out like we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Because they were able to overcome all those potential stumbling
points, the Seahawks are 6-2 and in sole possession of first place
in the AFC West after the Kansas City Chiefs lost to the
Indianapolis Colts earlier in the day, 25-17.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks in first place? This late in the season? It hasn't
happened since 1988, when they captured their only division
championship on the final day of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's weird, I'm just glad that it's
happening,'' said wide receiver Mike Pritchard, who contributed a
falling catch of a 20-yard touchdown pass from Jon Kitna. ``I think
that we realize it's only the half-way point and we don't want to
collapse. So we're going to go everything we can to keep it
rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   The real test is yet to come. Six of the Seahawks' remaining
eight games are against division opponents, starting with next
week's nationally televised game against the Denver Broncos in the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   In a season that has been a series of small, albeit progressive,
steps, the Seahawks' effort Sunday was a giant leap in the right
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The offense scored more points in the first half (28) than it
had in six of the first seven games. The defense continued to give
up too many yards (397), but also continued to make big plays that
counted even more _ and did it despite losing Pro Bowl defensive
end Michael Sinclair and disruptive defensive tackle Sam Adams to
injuries in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, they beat a bad team badly. The Bengals had more
yards in penalties (107) than they did rushing (103).
</P>
<P>
   ``We did only what we can do,'' said Cincinnati running back
Corey Dillon, who played at Franklin High School and the University
of Washington before being the Bengals' second-round draft choice
in 1997. ``I think everyone fought to the end, and that is all we
can ask of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, it wasn't enough as the Bengals slipped to 1-8.
</P>
<P>
   This was not Kitna's best day, either. After being named AFC
offensive player of the month last Thursday, he threw two
interceptions _ as many as he had in the first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight I was just fighting myself. I didn't feel on all
night,'' Kitna said. ``There weren't a lot of balls I threw that
went where I wanted them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Kitna got ample help _ especially from running back Ricky
Watters, who ran for a season-high 133 yards and scored the team's
first rushing touchdown of the season. Derrick Mayes added five
receptions for 61 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown pass that he
controlled with his left hand before tumbling into the back of the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But Kitna's effort wasn't as bad as he made it sound. He was 14
of 24 for 202 yards, including touchdown passes to Watters, Mayes
and Pritchard. And the offense scored four touchdowns for the first
time this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jon played pretty well,'' Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren
said. ``He has set a very high standard for himself, which is good.
He did some really fine things today.''
</P>
<P>
   So did the defense, despite that glut of yards it surrendered to
the Bengals. The most-obvious oops-play was Jeff Blake's 75-yard
touchdown pass in the first quarter that threatened to scrape the
Kingdome ceiling before it settled into Carl Pickens' hands at the
Seattle 25-yard line. Blake also scored on a 1-yard run in the
fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But in between, the Seahawks kept the Bengals between that rock
and a hard place that are their growing number of interceptions _
two more, added to their league-high total of 17 entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Anthony Simmons got to Blake on the third play of the
game, causing a fluttering pass that was picked off by defensive
tackle Cortez Kennedy to set up the Seahawks' first touchdown. In
the second quarter, Darrin Smith tipped a Blake pass in the end
zone and intercepted the carom to stop a Bengals' drive that had
reached the Seahawks' 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got some big plays on us,'' Smith said. ``We knew they
had big-play capability. We wanted to come out and play much better
than we did. We wanted to improve our stats defensively. We didn't
do that today.''
</P>
<P>
   But, once again, the defense made enough plays, and made them
when they were most needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to take one game at a time, and we're going to get
Joey in and when he does come in, we're going to welcome him with a
hug,'' said Kennedy, looking ahead to today's expected return of
Galloway. ``We'll have the deep threat and we'll be ready to rock
and roll next week.''

HOLMGREN'S HAWKS HOOKED ON WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Let's call Mike Holmgren a fisherman. Let's pretend
this is a Hemingway novel and Holmgren is the not-so-old man who's
in charge of the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   And let's say he uses a single-lure fishing reel.
</P>
<P>
   Every week, Holmgren lets out a little more of his line. The
more he feels his team's life, the surer he is they can handle the
task, and the more line he feeds them.
</P>
<P>
   And when absolutely necessary, he tugs the line in, scaling
back.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the team is a giant marlin that's edgy and strong and
needs some room to move, and Holmgren _ patient, persistent,
perfectionist, paternalistic _ gives them just what they need. No
more. No less.
</P>
<P>
   At 6-2 and in sole possession of first place in the AFC West,
what do you say about the Seahawks? That Papa Holmgren deserves the
big-kahuna dollars Paul Allen pays him?
</P>
<P>
   Why bother asking?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great about it,'' Holmgren said last night after the
Hawks dumped on a dismal Bengals team, 37-20, at the Kingdome,
where the final season might be a celebratory swan song for the ol'
concrete cave, where the Seahawks once did play big games in
January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very competitive road ahead and now we hit a little
stretch where we play in our division. These games are vitally
important,'' Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Seahawks emerge at the season's midway point as one of
only eight teams in the entire, parity-happy NFL with a record of
6-2 or better, they find themselves a member of the Elite Eight.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee, Miami, Jacksonville, St. Louis, Detroit, Buffalo,
Indianapolis and Seattle have taken the first half of the season
and separated themselves from the rest.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks are light years these days from the free-falling, such
as Denver, San Francisco and Green Bay. They are more consistent
than the flawed, such as Minnesota, Oakland and Pittsburgh. They
are not injured like Atlanta, the Jets or Dallas. And, best of all,
they are no longer in the realm of the perennial losers _ too many
in the league to name.
</P>
<P>
   That is why you have to start to wonder. What's it going to feel
like, waking up in the new century with a Seahawks playoff game on
the calendar?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what. It's an exciting time right now. I'm glad
to be a part of it. I hope the city and everybody's proud. We just
have to keep it going,'' receiver Mike Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mariners reel with the trade-me request of Ken Griffey
Jr. As Boeing suffers. As Microsoft deflects judgment from the U.S.
Department of Justice _ the Hawks are rolling.
</P>
<P>
   And chances seem excellent that they will continue to roll _
considering the way the Hawks keep passing the weekly tests their
coach administers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the funnest game we've played,'' tight end Christian
Fauria said after the Hawks used four wide-outs for the first time
all season, opening up the offense and taking another step.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran for a lot of yards. We had guys making big-time
catches. This is the way football should be. Fun. It shouldn't be
like pulling teeth,'' Fauria said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're helping each other. It's not about personal
achievement,'' Fauria said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren said Sunday he won't do anything different in managing
this Seahawks team, now that it has established a winning identity.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, the Hawks are suddenly different from years past.
They're more real, more of a threat, less likely to blow themselves
up somewhere in the next eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He expects us to be perfect,'' cornerback Willie Williams
said. ``We can't always be perfect. We know it. But he still
expects it.''
</P>
<P>
   What helps the Hawks achieve this lofty goal is the measured
approach Holmgren and his staff have used to implement the offense.
Slowly. A bit of line fed deliberately, patiently each week.
</P>
<P>
   In the elevator after last night's game, Holmgren's two
offensive coaches said it is too early to predict what will happen
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, quarterbacks coach Mike Sheppard and offensive
coordinator Mike Sherman said their entire mind-set is about
preventing turnovers. They will open the offense up only as far as
it can go without producing fumbles and a rash of interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The players understand this approach. They don't seem eager to
rush it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's more to come. We haven't played our best and
that's the scary part,'' Pritchard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first half (against Cincinnati), we're out there saying
we're disappointed that we only scored 28 points. Now, I don't
think that attitude's been here ever. So the coaches bring you a
positive attitude. They bring you confidence and the way we're
playing right now, we're just taking the steps. As long as we can
take the steps, we'll be satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``Monday Night Football'' last week, the Seahawks had their
coming-out party. They arrived. They marked a turning point in
their long-embattled history by going into Lambeau Field and
knocking the stuffing out of the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, it came at the expense of Brett Favre, Holmgren's former
student who, without Holmgren there to reel him in, threw four
interceptions and lost two fumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Favre's crumbling only served to further underscore the
cohesiveness and soundness of the Seahawks. But as big as last
week's defining moment was, Holmgren had the right words for his
team this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, coach Holmgren stressed that this game was bigger
than Monday night because of a possible letdown (after the big
win),'' Pritchard said. ``And if teams did what they did today,
since Kansas City (did lose) and San Diego (did lose), it puts us
in a great position right now.''
</P>
<P>
   We have not seen the best of Holmgren's Hawks yet. His
assistants say that might not even be in the cards this season. In
the meantime, what we have seen is good enough to get them a play
date in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Start spreading the news.

HUSKIES TAKE MOMENT TO PARTY, BUT IT'S `BEHIND US' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TED MILLER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ What started out as a high-five turned into a
bear hug as University of Washington athletic director Barbara
Hedges greeted Huskies coach Rick Neuheisel on the grass of Arizona
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Then things got nutty.
</P>
<P>
   A wild celebration in the stadium's southwest corner followed
the Huskies' 33-25 victory over the Wildcats. The jubilant
purple-clad fans chanted Rose Bowl. The players stuck roses in
their mouths. The Huskies cheerleaders danced, and so did
Neuheisel. He even played a little air guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday's) game meant a lot,'' Hedges said. ``We are
thrilled with where we are right now. There's a great atmosphere
around this football program.''
</P>
<P>
   This nationally ranked football program, that is. The UW entered
The Associated Press poll at No. 23 Sunday, while it was tapped
22nd by the USA Today-ESPN poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies improved to 6-3 overall and 5-1 in the Pac-10 and
moved one giant step closer to an unlikely conference championship
and Rose Bowl invitation. If the UW wins at UCLA on Saturday and
comes home to dispatch archrival Washington State on Nov. 20, the
Huskies are headed to Pasadena on Jan. 1.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a bad time to be a Husky. And that means it's not a bad
time to be Hedges, who is trying to wrap up the final year of a
five-year, $50 million fund-raising effort for the athletic
program.
</P>
<P>
   The UW has raised $40 million thus far for the massive
``Campaign for the Student-Athlete,'' which aims to complete $84
million in capital improvements to campus athletic facilities.
</P>
<P>
   A winning football team always helps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people are feeling good about what you're doing, they
are, in my opinion, going to be more willing to contribute,'' said
Hedges, who expects to sew up the final $10 million by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Those checkbooks figure to come out if the UW reaches its first
Rose Bowl since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The good fortune this season wasn't expected. The Huskies were
picked to finish sixth in the conference during the preseason.
Neuheisel was a first-year coach and was expected to suffer through
growing pains with questionable talent on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Statistically, the success doesn't make much sense. The UW
offense is ranked fifth in the conference; its defense is ranked
eighth. Evidently those proverbial intangibles have been working
their magic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have try-hard guys who find ways to get it done and make
plays they need to make,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   The UW's trip to UCLA will be televised at 12:30 p.m. by ABC. It
will be the Huskies' third consecutive game on ABC and fifth this
season. That means an extra $1.5 million in the school's athletic
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the work isn't done. If the UW loses either of its final
games, Stanford and Arizona State also have to lose if the Huskies
are going to win the conference outright. Oregon also remains in
the mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't lose sight of how we got to where we are, which is by
scratching, clawing and biting _ doing whatever it takes to get it
done,'' a cautious Neuheisel said. ``We haven't all the sudden
become a sleek race car. We are still a jalopy that finds its way
to the finish line.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, a national title contender last season, is riding a
three-game losing streak in which it has been outscored 105-14. The
Bruins, 3-6 overall, have lost five of their past six and are stuck
near the bottom of the conference standings with a 1-5 mark.
</P>
<P>
   The matchup also is a bit of a homecoming for Neuheisel, who
quarterbacked UCLA to a Rose Bowl championship in 1983. While
admitting some special memories likely will occur to him while he
paces the field Saturday, reminiscing wasn't a priority Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's way down the list in terms of what makes this game
important,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   What is important is the Huskies figure to be healthier this
weekend than they have been since losing to Arizona State a month
ago. Still, UCLA had a bye this weekend, which provided extra time
to deal with its own injury woes and to prepare for the UW.
</P>
<P>
   The post-game celebration was festive. But a little while later,
a team debriefing in the locker room made it clear that a dream
season has yet to be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great moment for all associated with Washington
football,'' Neuheisel said of the post-Arizona party. ``It is
behind us.''

SONICS TAKE TO THE ROAD WITH CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ You may tire of the constant references to last
season. After all, it was a throwaway campaign in many ways for the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   However, Sonics coach Paul Westphal has a photographic memory.
Those images of bobbing undefeated through the first week are
vivid. The difference is that group somehow won while playing ugly
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   This 3-0 Sonics start has not been flawless, though their games
have gone as advertised. They are embarking on a rugged, five-game
road trip powered by an aggressive defense and an athletic flair on
offense that is pleasing and paying early dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Those ingredients have the Sonics packing plenty of confidence _
even if no one believes they are for real.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys are probably unleashing a little frustration. You
know we've been getting pounded coast-to-coast about how bad we're
going to be, so they're enjoying that. I'll admit that,'' said
Westphal, whose team plays Philadelphia Monday night at the First
Union Center. The Sonics travel to Washington D.C., Cleveland,
Detroit and New Jersey before returning to KeyArena on Nov. 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very early,'' Westphal warned. ``We've only played three
games. But this team does have something.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, the Sonics have some decent players, too.
</P>
<P>
   It still is a bit early in the season for the Sonics to have an
I-told-you-so attitude. But the wily, new veterans and audacious
no-names are proving they have game.
</P>
<P>
   Consider what has gone right and who is responsible:
</P>
<P>
   -- Vernon Maxwell is a bringing a pop-a-shot mentality off the
bench. His ability to knife through the lane for layups and his
long-range shooting have provided the Sonics with scoring punch.
That, plus Maxwell's quickness and anticipation on defense, changed
the complexion of games.
</P>
<P>
   -- When you say energy and aggressiveness, you are talking about
Ruben Patterson, the obscure second-year player who is solidifying
the small forward position. Patterson sets the tone at the start of
games with his tenacious defense and rebounding. His fearlessness
around the basket has the defensive specialist with supposedly no
jump shot averaging 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   -- Horace Grant and Brent Barry's statistics are not
eye-popping. However, both have been steady: Grant with his
rebounding, defense and midrange jumper; Barry with his
contributions on the glass, and his ability to take pressure off
Gary Payton and run the offense.
</P>
<P>
   -- The trapping, rotating defense has stymied opponents at
critical points to feed the offense. The most recent example was
the 99-94 Saturday win against Utah. Down by 17 points, the Sonics
held the Jazz to 15 points in the third to turn the game around.
</P>
<P>
   Those factors were consistent in a pair of wins against the L.A.
Clippers and Dallas. The Sonics were impressive against their first
quality opponent, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just outworked us,'' Utah's John Stockton said. ``It's
just as simple as that. They outworked us and earned their way back
into it.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Sonics lose, it won't be because they lack hustle _
something often absent last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fast and we're quick,'' Patterson said. ``We get the
rebound, go up the floor, slam-dunk and have fun. We're going to
play hard every night.''
</P>
<P>
   It also has helped that Vin Baker has resembled his productive
self. He's off to a solid start _ rebounding and scoring with
authority. He's averaged 19.6 points, and more importantly, 10.3
rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong?
</P>
<P>
   For the Sonics, it seems all good, though they haven't been
lulled into believing the season will be without bad times. Another
vivid memory from last season is how a 6-0 start quickly turned
into a dismal 25-25.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows exactly what to expect from here on, but the Sonics
doubt things will ever get ugly. They aim to prove that on this
road trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've just got to win on the road. It's important to win on
the road,'' Payton said. ``If we can get three or four wins and
establish something, then we'll be fine. We'll take care of
business at home.''

DALE JARRETT ON NASCAR TITLE COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HOLLY CAIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It's not that Dale Jarrett prefers suspenseful
endings. They just tend to work in his favor. Jarrett is known for
skillfully sizing up his competition, biding his time and then
calmly and purposefully making a clean, late-race move to the
front.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has resulted in 22 NASCAR Winston Cup victories.
Now it appears to have landed him his first championship in stock
car racing's marquee series.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, 42, has challenged for the title the past three seasons
only to finish third, runner-up and third, respectively _
ultimately losing to hard-charging youngster Jeff Gordon twice and
wiley veteran Terry Labonte. Now, with two races remaining,
Jarrett's championship is the least suspenseful turn in his career.
</P>
<P>
   His sixth-place effort at Phoenix International Raceway Sunday
means he needs only to finish eighth Sunday at Homestead, Fla., to
give the Jarrett family its second-generation championship.
Jarrett's father, Ned, won the 1961 and '65 championships.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Jarrett's racing pedrigree and lifelong exposure to the
sport, his success has been a result of perseverance, not
privilege. Jarrett's father didn't wield his influence to help his
son start out with some big-budget race team. Jarrett spent many
years learning on the job driving cars with no legitimate shot at
winning races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to discourage him from racing because I knew the
sacrifices he'd have to make _ the peaks and the valleys _ and I
didn't want to have to watch my son go through it,'' said Ned
Jarrett, now a race commentator on television. ``We steered him
toward a pro golfing career and always thought he had the talent to
be on the PGA Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett is still a scratch golfer and was also an all-state
football and basketball player growing up in tiny Hickory, N.C. He
was 19 years old _ practically ancient by racing standards _ before
he began driving race cars competitively. Before that he worked for
his father's lumber company, worked the night shift at a printing
company, and even spent time selling vacuum cleaners. He didn't
arrive in the Winston Cup Series full time until 1987 at age 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to do this, but it was a lot easier to
convince my dad to spend $400 and give me a set of golf clubs than
to convince someone to spend $10,000 and put me in a race car,''
said Jarrett, whose first Winston Cup win came at age 35.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Jeff Gordon started racing at age 4 and had
claimed three Winston Cup championships by the time he was 27. Ned
Jarrett was only 34 when he retired in 1966 with 50 wins. Dale
didn't even have a competitive ride, much less a victory, at the
same age his father had finished driving.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to fan support, the low-key Jarrett doesn't always
command the loudest cheers during prerace introductions. But you
get the feeling that everyone is pulling for Jarrett _ even those
loyal to his competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it can't be (Dale) Earnhardt, then we pull for Jarrett,''
said one fan attending Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a new breed of fans,'' said longtime Jarrett devotee
Gary Sommers, of San Diego. ``Dale doesn't go back as long as
Earnhardt and Gordon's fans are all young, women or band-wagoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I like about Dale is that he's still the same person as
when he started out, a real professional driver, calm and
confident. He just never really had a good car underneath him to
show what he could do until now.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Jarrett's arrival at the high-profile Robert Yates
Racing team in 1995 was a big boost to his career. The team already
had 27 victories _ 15 thanks to phenom Davey Allison, who was
killed in a helicopter crash in 1993. This team knew how to build
cars. Jarrett knew how to drive them.
</P>
<P>
   He's used finesse, smarts and poise to win races instead of
relying on instinct and raw aggression. His smooth style has
succeeded even in stock car racing's bumper-banging competition.
But that's not to say Jarrett shies away from door-to-door racing
with the likes of Gordon or seven-time champ Earnhardt, aptly
nicknamed ``The Intimidator'' for his assertive driving techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Both of Jarrett's Daytona 500 victories (1993 and '96) came by
holding off Earnhardt in dramatic final-lap fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patient is a good way to describe how I go about things,''
Jarrett said. ``I don't profess to have the talent of a Dale
Earnhardt or a Jeff Gordon. I have to think my way through things
and get my car working better to have a chance to get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Athletes at every sport have people that perform at different
levels. Hopefully what I do gives a lot of people out there hope
that ambition, hard work and dedication pay off as much as
anything. You don't necessarily just have to have talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't mistake Jarrett's modesty for a lack of confidence,
however. He is sure of himself and his team, and eager to finally
land Yates his first championship in a decade of successful
seasons. People in the garage are taking note as well. Five of
Gordon's seven over-the-wall pit crew members will move to
Jarrett's car next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a son about to win the NASCAR Winston Cup championship
is exciting for a number of reasons, but mostly because I know
where he's come from and how hard he's worked to get to the top,''
Ned Jarrett said.

PICTURE BRIGHT FOR BENGALS' CURTIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALIYA SAPERSTEIN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Bengals linebacker Canute Curtis and cornerback Ty
Howard went in to drag down the Seahawks' Ricky Watters as he ran
off the right guard for a seven-yard gain. The whistle blew and
Howard untangled himself from the pile. Watters' legs were pinned
under Curtis, who remained face down on the Kingdome turf.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could move all of his limbs and everything, but he was
holding his neck and he could hardly talk,'' Bengals linebacker
Takeo Spikes said. ``It's hard. It's a part of the game, but you
hate to see it happen to anybody. Not just one of your teammates,
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Play was stopped with 2:48 remaining in the third quarter, as
team doctors strapped Curtis onto a board and loaded him into a
waiting ambulance. He was taken to the hospital with an undiagnosed
cervical injury, though he reportedly had retained full motor and
sensory function. The injury apparently resulted when Curtis'
helmet slammed awkwardly into Watters' thigh pad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was real concerned,'' running back Corey Dillon said.
``Canute is a good friend of mine, and for him to go out like that,
to leave with neck injuries ... I'm just hoping that he can
function and that things are all right for him. My heart goes out
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, in his third year with Cincinnati as a reserve
linebacker, is the latest injury to plague the team. In a preseason
game against Detroit on Aug. 20, first-year free safety Kelvin
Moore suffered a neck fracture when he stumbled into the knee of
Lions receiver Brian Stablein. He has been on injured reserve ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Though sidelined with less serious ailments, starting
cornerbacks Artrell Hawkins and Roosevelt Blackmon, as well as
defensive end Jevon Langford and quarterback Akili Smith, were
unable to play Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So add Curtis to the Bengals' list of tribulations, which
includes speculation that head coach Bruce Coslet is headed for the
chopping block as the scapegoat for their 1-8 season. But while the
players have accused each other of not giving all their effort this
season, defensive end John Copeland said the Bengals couldn't
afford to use Curtis' injury as an excuse to not keep playing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know they will not stop the game, and you know it can
happen to anyone at anytime,'' Copeland said. ``You can't think
about it, or you're beat already.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 31-13 when Curtis was taken off the field, the Bengals were
effectively beaten.
</P>
<P>
   The penalties that plagued Cincinnati early continued. The
Bengals committed four of their 16 penalties after Curtis' injury,
including a key offensive offside call on an onside kick attempt.
The Bengals also allowed the Seahawks to pad their lead with field
goals on two drives that ate up more than eight minutes in the
final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically we just killed ourselves. We didn't do the things we
needed to do,'' said Spikes, who had seven tackles and one
interception _ just before the Curtis injury. ``We got some bad
calls early, and we made stupid penalties out there all day. Once
you do that, you don't give yourself the chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense played well, but we put them in bad positions a
lot. You can't do that if you want to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly disheartened by the loss, Copeland still came up with
something positive from the game: Though it was unknown whether
Curtis would return with the team to Ohio last night, he appeared
to have suffered no permanent damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a relief. It's just a relief,'' Copeland said. ``It could
have been a whole lot worse. That is one bright spot we can take
out of the game. Probably the only bright spot.''

GALLOWAY RETURNS TO SEAHAWKS TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In the end, it had nothing to do with Joey Galloway's
current or future contract.
</P>
<P>
   Galloway, the Seahawks' leading receiver the past two seasons,
will end his 101-day holdout Monday morning because he misses
playing football.
</P>
<P>
   Despite premature reports and rumors that started late Friday,
Galloway did not decide to rejoin the club until Saturday night and
still was having second thoughts Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After the Seahawks' 37-20 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals at
the Kingdome Sunday, Galloway's coaches and most of his teammates
were taking a we'll-believe-it-when-we-see-him approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If and when I see him, I'll be very excited,'' coach Mike
Holmgren said.
</P>
<P>
   But friends and selected teammates said Galloway will be at the
team's headquarters today, when he and the club will send letters
to the NFL office asking that he be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how Galloway might be received, joining a division-leading
club that has gone 6-2 without him, quarterback Jon Kitna offered
the most honest appraisal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are going good, we were 5-2, everybody has to say the
right things _ `We can win without him,' and all that,'' said
Kitna, who called Galloway late last week. ``But I wanted to let
him know that: `Hey, look, the guys here would love to have you
back. You want to come back, don't let that deter you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway's return will be a distraction, if only because the
media will focus all the attention on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure it'll be a little bit of a distraction,'' Kitna said.
``But we're getting a new car if he comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   If he comes in? Galloway has struggled with this decision.
Saturday night, he told CBS SportsLine: ``People keep guessing
about what is coming down, but I'm the only person who really
knows. And even I don't know yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens now depends on what kind of shape Galloway is in.
He has been working out with Ohio State strength and conditioning
coach Dave Kennedy and playing flag football on Sundays with his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Seahawks placed Galloway on the reserve/did not
report list, they will receive a two-week roster exemption. It
would seem logical that Galloway might not be active for their
nationally televised game against the Denver Broncos on Sunday
night. But such a move might only increase the ill feelings that
have developed during his holdout, not to mention rob the offense
of the one element it has been lacking in his absence _ a deep
threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't say how excited I am to have him back and I don't
think there should be any hard feelings,'' guard Pete Kendall said.
``Any time you can have a guy who's a game-breaker, and Galloway is
a bona fide game-breaker, you take 'em when you can get 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Galloway also can expect to take some locker-room shots from his
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he'll get ribbed,'' Kendall said. ``I'm sure I'll rib
him.''
</P>
<P>
   So is Mike Pritchard, the leader of a wide receiver group that
has done better than just make do in Galloway's absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't come in thinking he's not going to feel some heat,''
Pritchard said through a smile. ``I'll have a little something to
welcome him back.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be perceived that Galloway caved, big-time. After all,
he opted to hold out rather than accept the team's seven-year, $35
million contract offer _ which has since been pulled from the
table.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Galloway will play for what's left of the $1.585
million he was scheduled to make in the fifth year of the five-year
deal he signed after being the club's first-round draft choice in
1995. He already has lost $837,117 by missing the first nine weeks
of the season. Another $210,000 will be deducted for the daily
$5,000 fines he incurred for missing training camp.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves $535,882, if Galloway is active for the remaining
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   By reporting at this time, Galloway will fulfill the final year
of his contract and become an unrestricted free agent in March. The
club undoubtedly will designate him its franchise player, meaning
they will have to tender him an offer that is an average of the top
10 players at his position _ somewhere between $3.5 million and
$4.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to earlier reports that this would devastate the team's
salary cap for next year, the club has factored in having to deal
with Galloway as a franchise player all along.
</P>
<P>
   But as club president Bob Whitsitt said after the game, those
are discussions for down the road. For now, getting Galloway back
on the field and back into an offense that has been productive
without him is the primary concern.
</P>

EXCITING YEAR IN NFL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Football League has just moved past mid-season, and
anyone who's worried about the Super Bowl matchup is missing a
pretty intriguing season.
</P>
<P>
   After all, we all know good Super Bowls come around as
frequently as El Nino and his sister, La Nina. The 1999 season has
been riveting, in a 31-car freeway pileup sort of way. Games are
close. Games are being decided in the last minute. And the teams
winning games are not the teams one would normally expect.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: Three of the four teams that played in last
season's conference title games have essentially been eliminated
from playoff contention, and the fourth is .500. The chance exists
that the six NFC teams that made the 1998 postseason (Arizona,
Atlanta, Dallas, Green Bay, Minnesota, San Francisco) will all miss
it in 1999. It would be a first.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: All three teams currently leading NFC divisions
were sub-.500 teams last season -- St. Louis (4-12), Detroit
(5-11), Washington (6-10), and no one in their right mind thought
the Lions would do this without Barry Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: Of the six AFC teams with two losses or less, two
were 8-8 last year (Seattle, Tennessee), one was 3-13
(Indianapolis), a fourth is all of five years old (Jacksonville)
and another is winning despite its future Hall of Fame quarterback
(Miami) being injured.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: 34 percent of all NFL games this season (43 of
127) have been decided by three points or less. More than half of
all games have been decided by a touchdown or less (65 of 127).
Five teams have had six or more of their games decided by seven
points or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   Even on a weekend that saw eight teams win by 14 points or more,
there were still two thrillers (Detroit-St. Louis, Chicago-Green
Bay), and three of the teams that won big were underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL will tell you that this is the definition of parity.
Critics will tell you that parity is synonomous with mediocrity,
and you can sell that issue. Commissioner Paul Tagliabue had one of
his many disingenuous moments this week when he used the Yankees'
25 World Series wins as contrast to the beauty of NFL parity,
conveniently forgetting the NFC's recent domination of the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But this season does have a different dynamic than in the past.
The NFL's worst kind of ``parity'' came in those years when an
unknown would pop up with a good season -- San Diego in 1994,
Atlanta last season, expansionists Carolina and Jacksonville in
1996. That wasn't parity, because you still had dynasty-like teams,
the 49ers, Cowboys, Packers or Broncos, standing tall at the end.
</P>
<P>
   That's no longer the case. I defy anyone to predict who will
make the Super Bowl, much less win it. I defy anyone to predict
which of the 11 AFC teams that are 4-4 or better will win one of
the six playoff berths, or if any NFC team will win more than ten
games.
</P>
<P>
   It is much easier to explain why things are crazy than
predicting what teams will survive:
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) The arms race: (end) The league has slowly been
morphing from an era of running backs to its current status as a
quarterback-driven league.
</P>
<P>
   But as defenses jam the box with bigger and more athletic
bodies, the need for a competent quarterback has increased, and
there simply aren't enough good ones. The 31 teams have started 50
different quarterbacks, and there are still eight weeks to play.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that a veritable unknown, St. Louis' Kurt Warner, who
the Rams didn't protect in the Browns expansion draft, can become a
sensation underscores the fraility of the position. Last season
presented a hint of things to come when the likes of Chris
Chandler, Vinny Testaverde and Randall Cunningham made it to the
Final Four. These guys wouldn't have been on anyone's short list.
</P>
<P>
   Things are even more extreme in 1999. The Vikings have turned to
their second retread in as many years, Jeff George. The Broncos
Sunday won with Chris Miller, playing his first game since 1995.
Three of the five quarterbacks selected in the first round of the
'99 draft have already started games this season. Two teams have
already started three different quarterbacks, Baltimore and the New
York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big influence on the season's lack of consistency. From
game to game, the starting quarterback is subject to change because
of injury of ineffectiveness. And even those teams with quality
quarterbacks aren't immune. Brett Favre and Troy Aikman may be Nos.
1 and 1-A, but their teams are on the bubble playoff-wise.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Shallow water: (end) The league has expanded by three
teams since 1995, creating more than 150 new jobs and spreading the
talent thinner. After watching the Browns of '99, can you imagine
what Houston of '02 is going to look like?
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Capology: (end) Little did some owners know there was
a downside to the salary cap. Teams that paid dearly to hold on to
franchise stars or sign free agents now find themselves strapped at
other positions.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of a few uberteams, like the 49ers, can be traced
directly to a misuse of funds that has gutted their secondary and
left them with few options when stars like Steve Young and Garrison
Hearst were injured. At one point this past offseason, the 49ers
found themselves $28 million over the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Injuries: (end) Besides Young and Hearst, there's
Denver's Terrell Davis and Shannon Sharpe, Atlanta's Jamal
Anderson, Arizona's Jake Plummer, Miami's Dan Marino, the Jets'
Testaverde. When you include retiree Sanders in this group, the top
four rushers of 1998 are all out of action.
</P>
<P>
   (set bold) Coaching insecurity: (end) More than a third of all
teams have changed coaches in the last two seasons (12), the kind
of insecurity that breeds conservative game plans and safe
decisions. That has a lot to do with so many close and low-scoring
games.
</P>
<P>
   But for every stinker like Bucs over Bears, 6-3, there seems to
be two games like Lions over the Rams, 31-27, and another comeback
win by Peyton Manning and the Colts. Maybe the Super Bowl will
stink once we get there. But until that time, it may be best to
enjoy the trip. It's never been wilder.

LION-HEARTED TRIUMPH FOR DETROIT TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTIAC, Mich. _ From what I understand, I am supposed to be
ranting about the NFL. A froth is supposed to develop around my
mouth as I tell you how expansion, free agency, and softies from
both Generation X and Generation.Com have ruined the game. To
emphasize my point, I am supposed to strap on my authentic leather
helmet and tell you how the original Canton Bulldogs would have
crushed all of today's spoiled pretty boys.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I admit my diatribe skills were lacking before Sunday's
game at the Silverdome. Now they are nonexistent. The fashionable
thing to do these days is to bash the ``watered-down'' NFL. In some
cities _ Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Phoenix _ I don't blame people
for their football bitterness. But in Michigan, fans believe the
Lions can go to the Super Bowl and win it, Barry Sanders be damned.
There should be similar joy in New England, but that's a story for
another time.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Lions beat the St. Louis Rams, 31-27. It was one of
the most beautiful games I've seen, partly because of what athletes
did on a field and partly because of the stories they carried off
it.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect statistic of the day was that each team had the ball
for exactly 30 minutes. Quarterback Kurt Warner said he was honored
to be involved in the game and he was on the losing team. Lions
cornerback Bryant Westbrook, who was called for pass interference
three times, said, ``When I'm 50, I'll tell my kids, `Hey, your dad
was getting toasted all day but his teammates came through for him
at the end.' '' Former Patriot and current Lion Corwin Brown sat at
his locker and said, ``I love this. I don't even want to leave. You
know what? I'm going to call Chris Slade right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown got up and tried to reach the New England linebacker. He
got no answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta tell Chris about this,'' he said. ``And McGinest, too.
I gotta talk to Willie.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown would be wise to call collect. There is a lot to tell.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if a 305-pound backup center, Ryan Tucker, would be
the receiver of the winning touchdown. The 24-year-old Ram scored
on a tackle-eligible play. His 2-yard catch and Isaac Bruce's
subsequent 2-point conversion made it 27-24 with 2:42 remaining.
Thinking the game was won, Bruce went to the sideline and began
mocking the fans by waving his arms. The 73,224 people watching,
most of whom had been pleading for the Lions to win, were silent.
They started leaving their seats one minute later when Gus Frerotte
was sacked on third down, setting up fourth and 26.
</P>
<P>
   So that meant the Lions were going to have to overcome a
touchdown by a backup center by counting on the arm of their backup
quarterback (Charlie Batch hurt his finger). They did it. The Rams
were in a defense that they call a ``three-deep zone.'' If you
don't know football jargon, don't worry about it. On this
afternoon, three-deep zone simply meant ``bad coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lions receiver Germane Crowell looked at what was before him and
ran a streak route. He caught a 57-yard pass. Six plays later,
Johnnie Morton was in the end zone with the ball, a 31-27 lead and
33 seconds remaining. Morton had been double- and triple-teamed all
day. And he dropped two passes. On his final catch, he saw single
coverage and easily caught the ball to finish off a nice, 12-yard
fade route.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was a miracle, but we definitely saw a
bright light coming through the roof of the Silverdome,'' Lions
safety Ron Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Really, both teams may have seen the light because neither was
expected to be 6-2 this morning. The Rams are led by Warner, who
says he is here because of his faith in God. His in-laws were
killed three years ago when their home was destroyed by an Arkansas
tornado. His adopted son was accidentally dropped as an infant and
suffered brain damage and partial blindness as a result of it. His
wife tells you how pleased she is to receive part of Warner's
``low'' $250,000 salary because, seven years ago, she was using
food stamps. Not long ago, the man who now leads the NFL with 24
touchdown passes was stocking convenience store shelves in Iowa for
$5.50 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions' story is not that dramatic. But they were dismissed
before the season began because Sanders, one of the top backs in
league history, abruptly retired. It was the typical breakup tale:
One party called the other a loser; one party asked for its money
back. If you look at the sorry 24 yards the Lions rushed for Sunday
_ 1.1 per carry _ you would conclude that the team misses Sanders.
The current Lions don't agree with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only speak for myself, obviously,'' said Rice, a Detroit
native, ``but I look at it like this: Last year, we were 5-11 with
Barry Sanders. And that's not good. That's terrible, actually. So I
knew we couldn't do much worse. I don't think Barry has any effect
on this team. None. He was probably at home watching the game. If
he's reading or listening, tell him I said hi. I wish him the
best.''
</P>
<P>
   A few feet away from Rice, Westbrook was sitting at his locker,
still in uniform. There was blood on his thigh pads. He sat and
smiled, saying over and over, ``Damn, I'm a happy boy.'' Brown said
he didn't want to leave because he wanted to ``enjoy the moment.''
How often do you hear people, in any profession, say that?
</P>
<P>
   The Rams had another chance after Morton's touchdown. By the
time they set up at their 23, there were 21 seconds remaining.
Warner's second pass was intercepted by Rice. The safety, who knows
all about the Lions' disappointing history, ran toward the
sideline. As he sprinted, he became emotional. He thought, ``I want
to give the ball to someone I love.'' He ran by his teammates,
searched the stands, and threw the ball to a fan he loves. It was
his father.

PLENTY FOR WALKER TO DIGEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The meal lasted three hours. As Zelda Fitzgerald might
have said, it was a movable feast. At a table in the Cheesecake
Factory in Chestnut Hill, Bill Russell and Antoine Walker sat and
talked about many things: basketball, responsibility, history,
celebrity, and, at the end, the most important issue of all for the
privileged: Who gets the check?
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always wanted a multimillionaire to take me to lunch,''
Russell said. ``I wanted him to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   No one paid. When the meal was finished, the manager came over
and told the two that the meal was on the house. And after three
hours of brain picking, what did Walker take away from the meal?
</P>
<P>
   He laughed, and said, ``I know I have to go out and eat with him
more often.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still too early to know if Walker will need more such
repasts with Russell, or if he's ready to do what Russell thinks he
can and should do: mature into the leadership role that has been
crafted for him and take the team where it hasn't been in a while.
It's a challenge Walker understands and accepts, but he still can
use Russell's wisdom every now and then _ who couldn't? _ to be
reminded of how to get it done.
</P>
<P>
   While reluctant to be viewed as anything more than the voice of
experience or a shoulder to lean on, Russell did say he not only
thinks Walker knows what's in store, but has what it takes to make
the Celtics a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the key player in making this thing work,'' Russell
said. ``There are others who make important contributions, but he
is the key . . . He's a guy that can hold that team together as a
unit because of the nature of his talent. Rick (Pitino) has
confidence in him that he can do that. I do, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Russell who suggested the two sit down for a chat.
Basically, he looked into Walker's eyes and said, ``So you want to
be a basketball star? I can help you.'' Walker thinks of himself as
a basketball star. He's been to an All-Star Game. He's making $9
million a year. He's captain of a team that takes its captaincy
serious. He knows all this is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   As Russell would say, ``So what? Where are the rings?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a great career so far,'' Walker said. ``I'm looking
to get better. I've had individual glory. I just haven't had any
team glory. I'm trying to get to that point where I have team glory
on a consistent basis.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first two games of the year, Walker was the epitome of
the unselfish, team-oriented basketball that Russell played and
Pitino espouses. He played like a poised veteran leader. He avoided
stupid shots. He let the game come to him. He ended up with nifty
stats and the team won, convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two games, Walker has tended to revert to the bad
habits of the Stepford 'Toine. That's the one who's booed at home.
He had a single assist and three rebounds in 37 minutes in
Saturday's 115-108 loss at Indiana. He did have 21 points, but
needed 23 shots to get them, making nine.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has had too many games like that one in his previous
three years and not nearly enough of the kind he had against
Toronto, where he was 9 of 13 from the floor and had 22 points, 8
rebounds, and 3 assists. That has been Pitino's blessing and curse;
how to extract the 9-for-13s on a more consistent basis _ you know
they're there. It hasn't been for lack of trying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat down with him and told him, `Antoine, you're no
different from me except you're a year ahead of me,' '' Pitino
said. ``If you're a true star, then make other people better, take
over the team, and get it to the playoffs. I think he's focused in
on all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been easy for Walker since he was anointed as the new
Chosen One when he came here in 1996. His first team lost 67 games.
He was seen as stat-conscious, selfish, immature, and, at times,
out of control. He was similarly seen as a rare package of enviable
skills which, if harnessed properly, could make him an annual
all-star. Few players at his height can do what he does.
</P>
<P>
   Pitino knows that and says he is trying to make Walker into the
best player he can, even if it does involve some very calculated
baiting by the coach, especially about Walker's weight. One year,
Pitino said Walker should go home and come back looking like Karl
Malone. The next year, Pitino said Walker should go home and come
back looking like Scottie Pippen. The two clashed recently over
what is the proper weight for Walker, who, by the way, thinks he's
fine the way he is, which is about 250.
</P>
<P>
   Russell essentially told Walker that if Pitino thought it best
for the team that he come back looking like Muggsy Bogues, then do
it. It won't always be what you'd like, but it may be for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a responsibility you have to accept, besides just
playing,'' Russell said. ``Sometimes, there are sacrifices you have
to make that go against your strengths. If you understand that,
that those sacrifices are still positive in nature and will help
the team, that's what we talked about. How are you going to make
those sacrifices and put them in the framework of a team concept?''
</P>
<P>
   Russell has spoken about such sacrifices on a constant basis
since he came back to the flock. ``I do know a lot about basketball
and team play,'' he said. He tells the players he's in demand today
for autographs and speaking engagements not because of his Most
Valuable Player Awards (five), or his All-NBA appearances (11), or
his All-Star Game appearances (12). He's in demand because he won
11 titles.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that some of what he said will rub off on Walker
and, by extension, the rest of the team. Pitino set the bar high
with his prediction that the Celtics will make the playoffs. Walker
thinks that's totally realistic and says he is prepared to do
whatever it takes. Chatting up a guy with all that history of
success can't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real good thing to have the opportunity to speak to
somebody like that on my own,'' Walker said. ``He shared some
stories and things he went through. That was interesting. I know
it's different now, but it's good to know what he went through.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having somebody like that who understands what you're going
through as a player is always good,'' he continued. ``We have a
better team now. I'm doing whatever it takes to help this team win.
I want to get into the playoffs. Obviously, I want to play well as
an individual. But I also want the team and organization to do
well.''
</P>
<P>
   If they do, Walker will be only too happy to pick up the check
at the next lunch.

THREE'S A CROWD IN BRUINS NET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three may go into one neatly in math class, but right
now the equation is causing some extra calculating in the Bruins
net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what we're going to do,'' said assistant general
manager Mike O'Connell. ``We really don't. What's messing this up
more than anything is the expansion draft.''
</P>
<P>
   June may seem more than an ice age away with not even
one-quarter of the NHL schedule burned off the calendar, but the
fates of Mssrs. Byron Dafoe, Rob Tallas, and John Grahame at the
moment remain tangentially connected to the June 23 expansion draft
in Calgary that will stock Columbus and Minnesota for 2000-2001.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe, who only 10 days ago ended his holdout and signed a
three-year, $9.45 million contract, would appear the least affected
by the 24-square-foot logjam in the Boston net. It would be highly
unlikely that the Bruins would trade him now, because they well
know the agony and pain of not having a true No. 1 backstop to work
the majority of the 82-game regular-season schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But also don't believe for a moment that Dafoe is an
untouchable, for a number of reasons: 1) His salary is high, by
Boston standards; 2) The Bruins began to win while he was a
holdout, because of the good work of Tallas and especially Grahame
and; 3) Management has a history of finding ways to export those
who make a lot of money and talk a lot of talk (see Adam Oates of
601 F Street NW, Washington, D.C.).
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe could be dealt, especially if a bonafide front-line scorer
comes on the market. For example, what if the Phoenix Coyotes
suddenly wanted to live up to the rumors and wheel Jeremy Roenick?
Their No. 1 netminder, Nikolai Khabibulin, remains unsigned,
unwilling to work for the $3 million a year (that figure sound
familiar?) the Coyotes have been offering. Dafoe there, Roenick
here, and voila, suddenly the logjam is gone and the Bruins have
added the vibrant 29-year-old Roenick to their attack.
</P>
<P>
   For those still doing the math at home: Roenick is making $4.2
million this year and is due to make $5 million in 2000-2001, the
final year of the long-term pact he signed upon his trade to
Phoenix from Chicago. Roenick becomes an even more significant
acquisition if No. 1 center Jason Allison is going to be hindered
much of this season with what appears to be chronic wrist and
forearm injuries.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, according to O'Connell, the Bruins have
received no feelers for either Grahame or Tallas in the wake of the
Dafoe signing. Boston boss Harry Sinden said there had been one
serious inquiry about Dafoe before his signing, but any talk came
to an end when Dafoe finally came to terms.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a Dafoe deal, what happens with the other two
netminders? Coach Pat Burns has stated clearly that he doesn't want
to keep three guys in gear all year. He also hasn't expressed any
urgency over the situation, but that could change in the short
stroke now that Dafoe, who backstopped the 4-2 win over the
Thrashers Saturday night, is on his feet, gaining strength and
taking his daily supplement of rubber pills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The easiest thing would be to send Grahame back to
Providence,'' said O'Connell after meeting with Grahame in the
press box Saturday night and discussing the situation. ``But that's
really not so easy, because, hey, the guy's been our best player so
far. You wonder about how that impacts him, and you wonder how the
team will take it _ what kind of message it sends.''
</P>
<P>
   Grahame has been clear about his lack of interest in starting
life over as a Baby Bruin in Providence. If the Bruins try to
demote Tallas via waivers, that's as good as giving him away,
because one of the other 27 NHL clubs will snatch him up in a
second _ if only to be able to expose him in the expansion draft.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most viable scenario is a trade for Tallas. The
Bruins might be able to get a third- or fourth-line forward in
return _ potentially valuable help here for the next five-plus
months _ and then worry about making a trade to get a
draft-eligible goalie back before the March 14 trade deadline. For
that matter, it's possible they could trade Tallas now and
orchestrate a deal (wink, wink) to get him back before March 14.
Dafoe would remain the No. 1, backed by Grahame, and Tallas would
be back for the late-season finish and the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something we've had to address immediately,'' said
O'Connell, whose club finally nudged over .500 for the first time
this year Saturday. ``We wanted to see how Byron was when he got
back in there, and we'll see how he's feeling after this first
game. We'll do something, but just don't know what that is yet.''

CUP MUDDIES HORSE OF YEAR VOTING

 CUP-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO

<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ So, which one is Horse of the Year? Only in
racing could there be a championship that doesn't produce a
champion. What a fine mess Saturday's running of the Breeders' Cup
at Gulfstream Park has left the sport in.
</P>
<P>
   The top Eclipse Award was for handicap star Behrens to lose, and
he promptly lost it, finishing seventh as the 2-1 favorite in the
$4 million Classic after never having raised a hoof. Lemon Drop
Kid, who won the Belmont and the Travers, also failed, finishing
sixth. River Keen, who had taken the Woodward and Jockey Club Gold
Cup in succession, was another flop, checking in 11th. General
Challenge captured the Santa Anita Derby and the Pacific Classic,
but wound up 10th.
</P>
<P>
   With the more highly regarded Classic contenders all falling to
19-1 shot Cat Thief, outstanding 3-year-old filly Silverbulletday
would have had a strong chance to be Horse of the Year, but she was
a poor sixth at 8-5 in the Distaff. And 2-year-old filly Chilukki,
the only prominent horse to come into the Cup undefeated (6 for 6),
was outfinished by 32-1 chance Cash Run when second in the Juvenile
Fillies, tarnishing her record. What to do?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Breeders' Cup was supposed to be definitive, and show us
which way to go,'' said D. Wayne Lukas, who trains both Cat Thief
and Cash Run. ``The day turned it upside down; it didn't decide
anything. This is a popular vote. The voters are going to have to
sit down and try to get to the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Left standing after the dust cleared was Daylami, who was
brilliant in winning the Turf. This was Daylami's only race in the
United States this year, but a horse needs to run just once in
North America to be eligible for an Eclipse. Another serious
contender is Artax, who captured the Sprint in the brilliant time
of 1:07 4/5, tying a track record set by Mr. Prospector in 1973.
Artax finished the season by winning three in a row _ and, in May,
he broke Dr. Fager's record at Aqueduct by running 1:20 for 7
furlongs; then, in October, he broke Groovy's record by running 6
furlongs in 1:07 3/5 at Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   Beautiful Pleasure was determined while authoring a
front-running victory in the Distaff, her third straight Grade I
tally. And, Soaring Softly was terrific, coming from ninth to win
the inaugural running of the Filly and Mare Turf. It was her second
Grade I in a row, following the Flower Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Observers also can go back in time and take a second look at
Charismatic, who won the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, but broke
down while running third in the Belmont in June, as his Triple
Crown bid fell short by a mere 16th of a mile.
</P>
<P>
   Some won't vote for a turf horse, especially one who has run
only a single eligible race, and that will hurt Daylami. Some won't
vote for a sprinter, figuring a sprinter is, by definition, a
failure because he cannot win at a distance, and that will hurt
Artax. And some won't vote for a female, simply because of gender,
and that will hurt Beautiful Pleasure and Soaring Softly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the criteria for Horse of the Year?'' asked Donna Ward,
who is assistant trainer to her husband, John, who trains Beautiful
Pleasure. ``Do you get penalized for being female. I hope that
she's considered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you beat records set by Dr. Fager and Groovy, and tie Mr.
Prospector, that's something,'' said Louis Albertrani, who trains
Artax. ``He does it pretty easy. Every race he gets better. The
word `bounce' isn't in his vocabulary. He continues to run hard,
and he's never missed an oat. He enjoys what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There were 101 horses on the Breeders' Cup card, and 27 wore
nasal strips, with three winning: Cash Run ($67), Anees ($62.60) in
the Juvenile, and Cat Thief ($41.20).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A 45-year-old man was killed Saturday when he apparently fell 40
feet from a catwalk situated above the rafters of the main viewing
stand at Gulfstream. Jonathan Lane, employed as a clocker at
Hialeah and Calder, was found by a member of the housekeeping staff
at 7 p.m., approximately two hours after the races concluded. The
Hallandale Beach Police are investigating.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joseph Chebet knew he needed to be patient. Adriana
Fernandez knew she dare not wait another moment. But while their
priceless blends of experience and intuition led them to react in
dramatically opposite ways Sunday, the results were identical:
victory in the 30th edition of the New York City Marathon, run in
comfortable temperatures and a bracing wind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am very much happy,'' said Chebet, the 29-year-old
Kenyan. It's no wonder: After finishing second to countryman John
Kagwe here the past two years, Chebet's win Sunday in 2 hours 9
minutes 14 seconds made him only the third man in history to score
a New York-Boston Marathon double in the same year, joining Alberto
Salazar (1982) and Bill Rodgers (1978 and 1979). Chebet will take
home $50,000 for the win and a $20,000 bonus for running under
2:10.
</P>
<P>
   In second place was the gutsy Domingos Castro of Portugal in
2:09:20, followed by Shem Kororia of Kenya (2:09:32), Giacomo Leone
of Italy (2:09:36), and Kagwe (2:09:39). Three-time Boston Marathon
winner Cosmas Ndeti did not finish.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, a 28-year-old from Mexico who also ended up second
here last year, earned a bit more by finishing in 2:25:06: $50,000
plus $25,000 for running sub 2:26. It was her first major marathon
win, and, despite wind gusts of 30 miles per hour, only 26 seconds
off the course record set by Lisa Ondieki in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without the wind, I probably could have broken the course
record,'' said Fernandez through an interpreter. ``At some places,
it almost stopped me.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it looked as if Franca Fiacconi of Italy might do
all the stopping: The aggressive defending champion, who loves to
run from the front and knew her best chance to win was to get away
early, took off with the gun and by the time she came off the
Verrazano Narrows Bridge after 2 miles had a 21-second lead. But
Fernandez wasn't about to concede that early, making up the gap
quickly in the next 2 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I let her go farther, she would gain confidence and maybe
win,'' said Fernandez. ``So I decided to catch up with her.''
</P>
<P>
   By Mile 6 in Brooklyn, it was already a two-woman race, with the
nearest challenger 38 seconds back. Fernandez and Fiacconi went
through the halfway point in Queens together at 1:13:03; by 15
miles, just before the Queensboro Bridge into Manhattan, the
Mexican had built a 12-second lead and never looked back on her
ailing rival, struggling with a painful right elbow (broken in an
August fall) and hurting left foot (injured metatarsal). With just
over 3 miles to go, Fernandez led by three minutes over Kenyan
Catherine Ndereba, who had pulled into second, and would easily
hang on to beat her by almost a minute and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Ndereba, who was sixth in Boston last April in her marathon
debut, finished in 2:27:34, while Germany's Katrin Dorre-Heinig,
bothered by the wind and her error in letting the others get away
early, was a disappointed third in 2:28:41. Fiacconi was fourth
(2:29:49).
</P>
<P>
   The men's race was much closer. A solid pack of perhaps a dozen
hit 13.1 miles in 1:04:24, and there were still eight men running
together when they turned off Central Park South back into the park
for the final half-mile.
</P>
<P>
   It was just after the turn that Leone broke things open;
although he failed at his attempt to surge, it opened the door for
Chebet, Castro, and Kagwe to take off. After Kagwe fell back, it
looked as if the still-swift 35-year-old Castro _ with 5,000-meter
speed that enabled him to challenge for a medal at the 1988 Seoul
Olympics _ might have the edge, but strength won out as Chebet
repeatedly fought him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pushing, pushing, pushing,'' said Castro, whose twin
brother, Dionicio, finished 33d in 2:28:06. ``But I couldn't put
out Chebet.'' He was, nonetheless, all smiles in his No. 2 spot.
``Very happy, because before New York many people think Castro may
be dead, because I am old man.''
</P>
<P>
   Chebet, too, was pleased. ``Winning Boston and New York at the
same time is super wonderful to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Top Americans were Dan Middleman of Raleigh, N.C. (26th in
2:24:52), and Kimberly Griffin of New York (12th in 2:48:29).

TITANIC WIN FOR MIAMI 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The odd concoction of football that is the Miami
Dolphins continues to brew, fermenting into one win after another.
</P>
<P>
   Defense and mistake-free quarterbacking again led the Dolphins
Sunday &UR;  &LR; night, Miami defeating the Tennessee not-so-Titans, 17-0,
before 74,109 at Pro Player Stadium, improving to 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, I felt we did what we had to do to win the
game,'' said Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson, the brewmaster of this
concoction. ``When you don't make mistakes on offense, and when you
play defense, you can win every game you play. I mean, every
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Titans quarterback Steve McNair entered the game leading a 6-1
team with intentions of making a statement that his team belonged
with Miami, the best of the NFL's best division, the AFC East.
Instead, McNair left having been shut out for the first time in his
pro or college careers, and said, ``You have to learn from these
mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   It marked the Dolphins' best start since 1990 and allowed them
to maintain a one-game lead in the AFC East over the Patriots and
Colts. And, yes, Dan Marino once again was watching from the
sideline as Miami continued to build a special season.
</P>
<P>
   Damon Huard, despite aiming many of his passes, continued to be
a most able replacement for Marino as he mostly threw short passes.
Time and again Huard came up with the key pass on third down, as
the Titans shut down Miami's running game by playing eight men up
front.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say Damon isn't making mistakes, and he isn't,'' said
wide receiver Tony Martin. ``But people are missing that he is
coming up with the big pass when we need one for first downs.''
</P>
<P>
   The concoction is stirred into a stiff brew by a defense that
has not allowed a TD since New England scored on it three games
ago. Cornerback Sam Madison was the featured player Sunday &UR;  &LR; night,
picking off three McNair passes, two on identical plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a three-pick game,'' said jubilant teammate
Terrell Buckley. ``I mean, to see it live, a real three-pick
game.'' All the more satisfying, said Madison, ``because the last
few weeks I haven't been seeing many balls, but I got a lot of them
thrown my way and I made the most of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie George came out running for the Titans, gaining 60 yards
in the first half, but Al Del Greco missed a 33-yard field goal in
the first quarter. Soon enough, Huard had thrown a 6-yard TD pass
to Stanley Pritchett early in the second quarter, then hit Martin
on a 43-yarder down the left seam for a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, not McNair, was sick to his stomach at halftime after
picking off two passes, and he was forced to sit out the early part
of the third period. Only two plays after his return, Madison
grabbed his third interception, saying ``I was in the zone.'' So
are the Dolphins.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
MIAMI _ Now that every NFL team has reached the midway point of the
season, the state of Florida is playing the best football in the
country.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miami and Jacksonville are the only remaining 7-1 teams in the
NFL. Florida State is ranked No. 1 in college football.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins remained in the running for home-field advantage in
the AFC by defeating the Tennessee Titans 17-0 on Sunday night
before 74,109 at Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, who won their fifth consecutive game, won't have a
chance to settle the issue with Jacksonville unless they meet in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only statement we made tonight is that we've been better
than seven of the teams we played,'' said Miami coach Jimmy
Johnson. ``Defensively, we did an excellent job of keeping a
talented team out of the end zone. Offensively, we did just what it
took to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins played solid offense and suffocating defense before
a national television audience Sunday night. They toyed with the
Titans for a few minutes in the first quarter before taking control
and never letting Tennessee get within breathing distance.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's defense hasn't allowed a touchdown in 14 quarters and
the Dolphins haven't surrendered a rushing TD this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to know that you can have a bad game and score
seven points and still win with our defense,'' Dolphins receiver
Tony Martin said. ``That's a phenomenal feeling to have if you're
an offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Titans were trying to improve their record to 7-1 for the
first time since 1991 when they were the Houston Oilers. They
smelled a lot like the old Oilers by laying a rotten egg that stunk
up South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were where we wanted to be,'' Titans fullback Lorenzo Neal
said. ``You can't pray for rain and then complain about the mud. We
were in a perfect situation, and we let it slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   One week after returning from back surgery to spark an upset of
the St. Louis Rams, Titans quarterback Steve McNair played one of
his worst games as a pro. He was intercepted three times by
cornerback Sam Madison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little shocked,'' said Madison, who was forced to
leave the game for a few minutes because of an upset stomach. ``I
was a little dizzy, but I fought through it and came up with some
great plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been frustrating the last couple of weeks because I
hadn't been getting many balls thrown my way, but tonight I got a
lot thrown at me and I made the most of it. I was able to give our
offense some field position. It was like I could do anything I
wanted to.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's awful performance contributed to the team's first
shutout since 1989, when the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Oilers
34-0. He completed 22 of 42 attempts for 205 yards. He was sacked
four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard lesson,'' McNair said. ``That's the first time
I've ever played on a team that's been shut out, and that includes
pee-wee football. It's very frustrating. I take full
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're 6-2 at the halfway point. If we go 6-2 over the
second half, I'll like our chances.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Titans go 6-2 over the second half, they will finish 12-4
and tie the 1993 team for the best record in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy's plan succeeded,'' Tennessee coach Jeff Fisher said.
``He wanted to run the ball to keep it away from us, force some
turnovers to shorten the field and get up on us so they could do
different things with their defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what happened. We didn't get untracked
offensively. We let things slip away early when we moved the ball
and didn't score.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami, which generated only 237 yards of total offense, retained
its one-game lead in the AFC East over New England and
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans were the second game of a murderous six-game stretch
in which the Dolphins play teams with nothing but winning records.
They beat Oakland and Tennessee, and now travel to Buffalo, host
New England, visit Dallas and host Indianapolis before getting the
Jets and Chargers in three of four games.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Damon Huard, who has replaced the injured Dan
Marino, won his third start in a row. Huard, an NFL Europe refugee,
badly outplayed McNair. Huard was 15-of-25 for 210 yards, threw two
touchdown passes and didn't suffer an interception.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out in an eight-man front, and that left some guys
open down the field,'' Huard said. ``We're playing outstanding
defense, and our special teams are making plays. That means if we
(offense) don't do anything silly, we've got a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we'd like to make some more big plays and score a few
more touchdowns, but the object is to not turn it over and put the
defense in bad position.''
</P>
<P>
   Huard became the first Miami quarterback other than Marino to
win three consecutive games since David Woodley in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Huard's touchdown passes covered six yards to fullback Stanley
Pritchett and 43 yards to Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Olindo Mare added a 46-yard field goal.

A BIG LOSS FOR PENN STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ So you're Penn State this morning. Are you happy? Of
course not.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a possible unbeaten season, a berth in the Sugar
Bowl, and the chance to win the national championship, you now are
looking at the Rose Bowl _ if you beat Michigan and Michigan State
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when you lose a game in November, as the
Nittany Lions did Saturday, 24-23, to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   And if Penn State doesn't win its last two games, it might find
itself in the Citrus Bowl against someone like Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   So you're Tennessee this morning. Are you happy? Of course you
are. You're patting Smokey on the head, singing ``Rocky Top,'' and
you just know that things are going to work out so you can get back
to the Sugar Bowl, where you can defend your national championship.
</P>
<P>
   And the funny thing about it, you probably won't even have to
play in that silly elimination process called the SEC title game to
get there.
</P>
<P>
   By beating Notre Dame, 38-14, Saturday night, the Volunteers
improved their record to 7-1, winning their sixth straight game,
and jumped to third place in both polls, a heartbeat from getting
one of the two BCS championship game slots.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Vols must beat Arkansas, Kentucky, and Vanderbilt
the next three weeks, but things look very bright with Penn State
out of the picture, Virginia Tech looking very beatable entering
Saturday's Big East showdown with Miami, and Florida looking
vulnerable after barely beating Vanderbilt in the Swamp and facing
an even tougher challenge in two weeks against Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   So you're Virginia Tech this morning. Are you happy? You're
delirious because you survived what looked like a certain loss at
West Virginia. If you lost that one, you would have been Kansas
State a year ago, falling out of sight in the polls and out of the
national championship picture.
</P>
<P>
   But now you're worried. You've looked like a scared,
pressure-affected team the past few weeks, struggling against
Pittsburgh and needing a miracle play by quarterback Michael Vick
to set up a winning field goal against West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   What looked like a sure thing against Miami only a few weeks ago
now doesn't look certain at all, even though the game is in
Blacksburg.
</P>
<P>
   Not much is at stake. Just the reputation of the school, and of
the league, in the only chance you have had to play for the
national title.
</P>
<P>
   And even beating Miami may not guarantee anything, if Tennessee
keeps picking up votes and support.
</P>
<P>
   So you're Florida State this morning. Are you happy? Sure. You
didn't play, no one got hurt, no one got arrested, and you
strengthened your hold on the No. 1 ranking in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   You've got what should be a tuneup this week against Maryland
and then the showdown with Florida, but if the Gators have trouble
beating Vanderbilt at home, you have to like your chances when you
come to The Swamp Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Things, as they do each season, slowly are sorting themselves
out. We are down to a few weeks of games and the pretenders are
being thinned out.
</P>
<P>
   No playoff system in major college football? You've got to be
kidding. It's already started. It's one and done time. Lose a game
and it's see you later.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are bad seasons, and bad careers. Take the sorry plight of
Rutgers fourth-year junior wide receiver Walter King. King was part
of the carnage Saturday when Rutgers dropped to 0-9 with a 33-7
loss to Navy. That's bad enough. But King has been at Rutgers since
1996 and has a personal 23-game losing streak. He was on the team
when Rutgers lost the last three games of the 1996 season, was part
of Terry Shea's first 0-11 season in 1997, missed all of last
season with a back injury, and now comes this season, with games
against Syracuse and Miami remaining . . . Utah quarterback Darnell
Arceneaux remained in a Salt Lake City hospital with what was
described as ``a massive concussion'' sustained during a 43-29 loss
to Wyoming. Tests showed no permanent damage . . . SMU reportedly
is investigating a former football player's allegations that a
recruiter suggested he cheat on his college entrance exam.
Assistant coach Steve Malin agreed to pay $100 to have a stand-in
take the American College Testing exam for Corlin Donaldson in
1998, Donaldson alleges in Sunday's editions of The Dallas Morning
News.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider the race for the Heisman Trophy all but over.
Wisconsin's Ron Dayne rushed for 222 yards, including a 42-yard
touchdown, in the Badgers' 28-21 win over Purdue. With only Iowa
remaining, Dayne needs 99 yards to break Ricky Williams's
short-lived career NCAA rushing record. And with Purdue's Drew
Brees and Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton both coming off losses, no
other legitimate candidate remains . . . Dayne didn't even top the
week's running back performances. Sacramento State's Charles
Roberts rushed for 409 yards and five touchdowns in a 41-20 win
over Idaho State, and Miami of Ohio's Travis Prentice rushed for a
school-record 376 yards in a 32-23 win over Akron . . . Watch out
for Alabama-Birmingham as a future power. The state is rich in
talent, and the Blazers have conference and school commitments to
build the program. That was evident in their 36-17 stunner over No.
18 East Carolina, the Blazers' first victory ever over a ranked
team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Boston College, which is 25th in the coaches poll, moving up one
spot, had a week off. But the importance of Saturday's game against
West Virginia can't be overemphasized. A win would give the Eagles
seven victories, which should get them into either the Insight.Com
Bowl in Tucson or the Music City Bowl in Nashville. With Hawaii
winning Saturday, and with several Pac-10 and ACC teams also
becoming bowl eligible, any possibility of BC going to a bowl in
Hawaii appears dead. Also apparently gone is an at-large slot in
the Motor City Bowl against probable MAC champion Marshall. With
Minnesota's win, that bowl now has its pick of Big Ten teams to
fill the other slot . . . Nice to see Michigan State's defense
returning to action. After back-to-back losses to Purdue and
Wisconsin, the Spartans held Ohio State to 0 rushing yards in a
23-7 win. Michigan, which had allowed 100 points in its three
previous games, also found its defense in a 37-3 win over
Northwestern. But does that count? . . . Congratulations to Oregon
State and coach Dennis Erickson. By beating California, the Beavers
improved to 6-3, their first nonlosing regular season since 1970. A
bowl game, most likely in Hawaii, probably awaits.

MAVERICKS RUN AFOUL OF SHAQ, GET BUSTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There it was, the Los Angeles Lakers just sort of
muddling along to a somewhat dull 105-97 victory against the lowly
Dallas Mavericks on Sunday, when Shaquille O'Neal learned nothing
is free.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Mavericks coach Don Nelson decided to attack the
Lakers' most glaring weakness _ O'Neal at the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson warned the officials that every time the Lakers inbounded
the ball, they were going to quickly foul O'Neal. And they did,
five consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you can always count on Nellie to screw a game up,''
said bemused Lakers coach Phil Jackson. ``The guy is on the rules
committee. He finds more ways of bending the rules than Richard
Nixon did as president.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the night before, when the Trail Blazers had fouled
O'Neal hard under the basket and incurred his wrath _ and ultimate
ejection _ the Mavs gently fouled O'Neal before he could even
approach midcourt. O'Neal hit 5 of 10 free throws in the closing
minutes, including his last two, to somewhat foil Nelson's unique
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's shooting 35 percent from the line; it only makes sense,''
Nelson said. ``But the competitor he is, he made a pair. That's
part of the risk you take.
</P>
<P>
   ``We exchanged glances a couple of times, so that was fine. I
love the guy. We don't have an answer for him. His free-throw
shooting is about the only weakness he has.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal hit 10 of 23 free throws on the night and finished with a
game-high 30 points and 20 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   An interesting idea but in the end, not a particularly effective
strategy. The Lakers led 92-80 when Nelson began his unique
approach, and 99-89 when Jackson removed O'Neal with 3:16 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a strategy Phil had,'' Nelson said. ``I was going to
continue on. If we could have just made a run, we would have had
some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson said he had used a similar approach when he coached the
Knicks and O'Neal was at Orlando, just not so blatantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was (baloney),'' O'Neal said. ``Nellie always
does that.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was not thrilled, but his anger was reserved for
Portland's Jermaine O'Neal, the Blazer who had inspired his two
technicals with hard fouls. O'Neal promised to retaliate against
Jermaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get him back,'' O'Neal said. ``He knows that. I
promise you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's late-game approach at least added some sparkle to what
had been a somewhat routine game before another lifeless Staples
Center crowd, this one of 18,068.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers led 52-45 at the half, pushed their lead to 15 points
at the end of the third quarter, and then scored six unanswered
points to take a 21-point lead. The Mavs, getting a hot hand from
Dirk Nowitzki (20 points), pulled within 10 before Nelson started
fouling O'Neal as soon as the ball was inbounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had plenty of attempts to practice his free-throw
shooting,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice added 20 points and seven assists (his high as a
Laker). Michael Finley led the Mavericks with 29 points.
</P>
<P>
   A day after a disappointing loss in Portland, the Lakers came
back, showed more movement and took care of business. It was their
16th consecutive victory over the Mavs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of energy early,'' Rice said. ``We established we
were ready to play tonight.''

agencies and companies who buy those ads have relied heavily on
that data to build their businesses, and until now they have been
generous about sharing it freely with each other. Now one of the

NETS CHANGE OFFENSE AND GAIN FIRST VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The Nets spoke about the new motion
offense they instituted on Saturday as if it were a magic potion,
as if the cutting and passing it demanded would cure all that has
afflicted them. And while the scheme did not help their heretofore
woeful perimeter shooting, it did enable them to burst into the
victory column with a much-needed 112-87 victory over the
Washington Wizards Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the type of balanced offense that evaded them over the
first three games, the Nets improved to 1-3 and eased the
burgeoning tension that was beginning to surround the team and
Coach Don Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Johnny Newman came off the bench to lead all scorers
with 25 points and Keith Van Horn added 23 points and a career-high
18 rebounds. Kendall Gill followed with 19 points.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury, who entered the game averaging 30.3 points and
28.3 field-goal attempts a game, finished with just 10 points, his
lowest output as a Net since scoring 8 points against the Knicks on
April 11. Marbury, who shot 4 of 17 from the field, had a
season-high eight assists. Jamie Feick added 16 rebounds for the
Nets, who shot 42.7 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The change in offensive strategy was evident immediately.
Instead of dominating the ball, Marbury often passed to Gill after
crossing halfcourt and cut through the defense toward the baseline.
With Gill running the offense from the top of the key and his
teammates picking and cutting beneath the foul line, the Nets were
fluid for one of the first times this season.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a balanced offense that saw four Nets take five
or more shots in the first quarter. Scott Burrell, a first-quarter
wonder who had scored more than 80 percent of his points in the
first 12 minutes of each game, canned two 3-pointers to lead the
attack with 9 points. Marbury took seven shots, making three and
scoring 8. With Gill and Van Horn combining for 10 more points, the
Nets raced to a 29-17 lead, their biggest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first three games, most of Marbury's highlights had
come on scoring moves, but four minutes into Sunday night's game,
he pulled off a spectacular assist that showed how dazzling a
playmaker he can be. Blowing by Rod Strickland, Marbury drew three
defenders in the middle of the paint before whipping a wraparound
pass to Feick, who was streaking in along the left baseline. Feick
received the pass in stride and finished with an uncontested dunk.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's humiliating loss to Toronto, Van Horn wondered
aloud about the Nets' lack of passion, noting the absence of
high-fives and screams after inspiring plays. In the second
quarter, the 6-foot-10-inch forward did his part to evoke some
emotion from his teammates. After swooping in from the left side to
catch and dunk a missed jumper by Lucious Harris, Van Horn came
down slowly and stared, then pointed at his injured teammate Jayson
Williams, who was sitting on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the play got Van Horn pumped because he went on
to grab nine rebounds in the second quarter. He would go on to tie
his career high of 16 at the 2-minute-12-second mark of the third
quarter. Feick added nine first-half rebounds to Van Horn's 12 to
help the Nets to a 28-22 advantage on the boards. The rebounding,
particularly the 11 on the offensive end, enabled the Nets to
overcome their 42.9 percent shooting and take a 53-46 lead into the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum shifted briefly at the start of the third quarter
when Washington opened with 9 unanswered points and took a 55-53
lead on a 3-pointer by Strickland. But the Nets rallied for an 18-4
run that put them in control by the midway point of the quarter.

 MAJOR PARTIES SET THEIR SITES ON THE WEB  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With next year's presidential election fast approaching, the GOP
will fire the latest salvo tomorrow in the political war to
dominate the Internet and bring in millions of new voters and
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson will
announce plans for ``GOPnet.com,'' a two-year, $2 million project
described as ``the nation's first political portal.'' It is part of
an ambitious initiative called ``e-GOP'' that insiders say aims at
transforming the Grand Old Party into a full-fledged Internet
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The GOP mission over the next decade is to create the most
active, inclusive electronic party possible to communicate with the
emerging cyber-citzenry,'' said Nicholson, in San Francisco for a
visit last week.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lures he is planning for GOP Web subscribers:
television-quality, full-screen video on demand; personalized
calendar services; custom news delivery; instant polling; and the
ability to ``talk back'' to politicians _ even during live news
events.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore its attempt to become a ``Web-driven
organization,'' party leaders plan to have GOPnet.com up and
running when the Republican National Committee holds its winter
meeting in San Jose in January, according to a GOP memo on the
project.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time Republicans meet for their national convention
in Philadelphia next August, the GOP aims for ``an established,
on-line community of 100,000 cyber-activists ... and 50,000
subscribers to GOPnet.com,'' the memo says.
</P>
<P>
   ``(This) is not your father's Republican Party,'' said the
committee's deputy chief of staff, Larry Purpuro, who said
Nicholson is now mulling plans to open an Palo Alto office for the
party's Silicon Valley interests. ``Al Gore may have invented the
Internet _ but Republicans are making it work.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats aren't far behind, racing to develop their own
``e-Party'' initiative, including an Internet portal, with the
fund-raising support and blessing of President Clinton, Democratic
National Committee Chairman Joe Andrew said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew claimed it was the Democrats, in 1996, who were the first
to fully  &LR; test the power of the Web in political organizing. He
says they have been aggressive ever since in expanding their
grassroots organizing to the Web; he cites Democratic wins across
the country in this month's elections as examples of that winning
strategy. ``In every single one of those victories, the Internet
played a significant role as an organizational tool,'' said Andrew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans' priority is using the Internet as a
fund-raising tool ... to sign people up to get money,'' Andrew
said. ``Our goal is to use the Internet as a communications tool,
to provide more information to people, so they're more likely to
participate in elections and want to vote for a Democrat.''
</P>
<P>
   The fierce competition between Republicans and Democrats in the
development of political Internet outreach takes a direct cue from
corporate America _ where efforts to lure online customers have
long included perks like gifts, personalized shopping services,
customized calendars, e-mail alerts and interactive celebrity
chats.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, political parties ``seemed to be behind the
times,'' still heavily dependent on costly direct mail and media to
get out their message, notes  &LR; said Michael Senne, founder of
Pixelon Inc., a San Juan Capistrano-based tech  &LR; firm that has
worked on streaming video for the GOP Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But studies show that by the next presidential election, nearly
half of voting-age Americans are expected to hit the Internet for
political news _ and a whopping 70 percent will have Internet
access. That has prompted parties to seek cheaper, faster ways to
reach people, without relying on the often-critical eye of the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could signal a profound change in American politics,''
said Wade Randlett, vice president of San Francisco-based Red
Gorilla, an e-commerce firm, and a Democratic activist tapped to
assist the party's initiative. ``Instead of vent.com or whine.com,
we've got a place where you can (communicate) with the people who
are voting on the issues: guns, paying down the debt, education,
prescription drugs, anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley executives involved in the Republican project say
they are impressed with the GOP's sophisticated approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Republicans) understand the new millennium is going to be
about communication _ and the most effective communication will be
on the Web,'' said Tom Ku, president and chief executive of
Quaartz.com, a Santa Clara-based firm whose technology will give
voters customized calendar and news services. ``They've taken the
tremendous revolution in protocols and Web sites ... and used it to
increase the effectiveness of their message.''
</P>
<P>
   By offering innovations like ``television-quality, full-screen
video'' of a candidate speech or political debate at the click of a
mouse, Senne of Pixelon says the GOP will be able to attract
millions of curious voters. Better yet, a candidate can ``deliver
his themes, his platform points, his daily messages to the country,
to everyone who has an Internet connection _ without media
interpretation or mutilation.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, too, see the value of ``unfiltered'' broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, President Clinton and high-tech leaders like Marc
Andreessen will host an online town hall ``voice chat'' beginning
at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The event _ in partnership with Redwood City-based Excite &LR; Home _
will allow anyone with Web access to pose questions to the
president by signing on to townhallmeeting.excite.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're going into an election year, and the candidates
are dipping their toes into the Internet for political discourse,
there's a lot of interest picking up on the Web,'' said Fred Siegel
of Excite &LR; Home. ``People will take it much more seriously and be
more engaged than if we were doing it even a month ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say the potential for such  &LR; innovation is
enormous _ but bells and whistles alone won't make people
interested in voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can build a site, but nobody will come _ unless you
provide them with something that will bring them back in,'' said
Leslie Goodman, a Republican political consultant and editor of
politicalaccess.com, a leading political Web site. ``It's not a
replacement or substitute for precinct-walking. ... Anybody who
thinks they can win an election on the Internet alone is missing a
huge slice of America.''

 GET A TICKET, GO TO THE GYM  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The police must be reading the papers, seeing
the studies that show we're all getting fatter, expanding like the
universe, especially the yoot of America.
</P>
<P>
   Two S.F. cops in a squad car stop a young man on a bicycle, on
the cable car tracks on Powell just below Ellis. After a short
discussion, one cop tells the young man, ``If you get down and do
10 push-ups, I won't give you a ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The young man does and the cop doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   If this is one of D.A. Terence Hallinan's diversion programs, I
support it. But I bet the rider could have plea-bargained down to
five jumping jacks and two minutes of community service, picking up
bowled-over pedestrians.
</P>
<P>
   TOM ``THE BODY'' Ammiano shocked the city by storming into a
mayoral runoff with Willie Brown despite a campaign that was
shorter than Brown's speeches and cheaper than his lunches.
</P>
<P>
   One theory is that Ammiano got a heavy sympathy vote because
he's a regular Muni rider, although ``regular Muni'' might be an
oxymoron.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano's surprise showing is being hailed as a populist
triumph, and not to be Ned Negative, but it  &UR; is  &LR; a gloomy Monday
morning, so a couple thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the write-in vote isn't so much a testimony to Ammiano's
political incandescence as it is the answer to the question,
``Where's the outrage?''
</P>
<P>
   And: Brown and Ammiano promise to engage in noble and dignified
debate on real issues, no mudslinging. But remember that Clint
Reilly's poor showing in spite of the fortune he spent is
attributable in no small part to Jack Davis yanking an ugly
skeleton out of Reilly's closet.
</P>
<P>
   Willie probably won't attack Ammiano directly, but remember that
Jack the Ripper Davis is on Brown's payroll. Wait, that's wrong.
Davis isn't on Brown's payroll, he's on Home Depot's payroll.
Politics sure gets confusing.
</P>
<P>
   But as one insider says, ``Davis will tear Ammiano apart.''
While Brown keeps his distance, far above the flying mud.
</P>
<P>
   STEVE YOUNG and Sharon Stone were seen on the town over the
weekend. But not together. I just wanted to get your attention for
these celeb sightings:
</P>
<P>
   Young, the 49ers' sore-headed quarterback, dined at John's Grill
on Friday night with his fiancee and four friends. Steve chatted
with the house band, The Wee Three, told bassist Tony Saunders that
he (Young) plays guitar, right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   That's no big deal, unless John's announces that the upstairs
room is featuring the jazz of The Wee Four.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, S.F.'s hottest auctioneeress, presided over the Glide
Memorial charity auction Saturday night at the Marriottcq &LR; , reports
Cuffs Corbett, man-'bout-town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got five, do I hear five-and-a-half? Fiveandahalf, do I
hear six?'' Stone said, then interrupted herself. ``Hey, I'm a
blonde, but I can count.''
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, wasn't that TV legend Tom Brokaw jogging 'round the
lush grounds at Dinah's Garden Hotel in Palo Alto? No common
quarters for Brokaw, who R&AMP;R'd in the African Suite, which features
a coffee table made from the hand-carved bed of a Senfu tribal
chief. When they recycle in Palo Alto, they do not mess around.
</P>
<P>
   THE BULL played the late set at Bix one recent night, went home
and died in his sleep at 76.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt Ruther was his name, and fellow jazz players say he put
down the beat like nobody, rock-steady and ocean-deep. ``He left
the high notes for the other bass players,'' says Benny Miller, who
plays sax in the Bix trio.
</P>
<P>
   The Bull played with Brubeck, Mulligan, Shearing, Basie _ stop
me if you hear a familiar name.
</P>
<P>
   The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz says, ``Ruther is known for his
firm tone and ebullient sense of swing.''
</P>
<P>
   What a great jazz-style legacy. Most of us will have to settle
for something like, ``He was known for his firm jowls and ebullient

   DISMANTLED: The Hooverville that sprang up along Fourth Street,
just across the Mission Creek Marina, is history.
</P>
<P>
   The scraggly quarter-mile roadside stretch of tents, cardboard
condos and assorted live-in vehicles was cleared away recently, a
couple hundred semi-homeless squatters shoo'd and scattered by
order of whoever's in charge of keeping the semi-homeless blowing
in the wind.

   TRAIN WRECK near Salinas late last week, and a Monterey TV news
show rounded up a sheriff's officer and a CHP officer at the scene.
Brief interview, then a break. The two officers assumed they were
off the air, but they were still live, with sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gotta get my serious face on,'' one cop said to the other. ``I
look OK? No boogers?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No boogers,'' said the other.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not sure what that word means, might be law-enforcement
slang for ``suspects'' or ``serious injuries.'' But I bet someone's
got a new nickname.

NEXT TO MOM AND DAD IT'S A HARD LIFE (OR NOT)

   Money doesn't buy happiness _ and among teen-agers, it may
actually make life feel harder.
</P>
<P>
   In a New York Times/CBS News Poll last month, 1,038 young people
aged 13 to 17 were asked to compare their lives with what their
parents experienced growing up. Overall, 43 percent said they were
having a harder time, 33 percent said they were having an easier
time and 23 percent said it was about the same. At the same time,
there was a divide along economic lines, with the upper-income
children saying they were feeling more burdened.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the affluent teen-agers, whatever their race or gender,
were substantially more likely than those from more modest homes to
report that their lives were harder and subject to more stress:
Among those with household incomes of $75,000 or more, 50 percent
said their lives were harder, 28 percent said easier and 21 percent
said they were about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Among those from families where the household income was less
than $30,000, only 38 percent said their lives were harder than
their parents', compared to 41 percent who said their lives were
easier and 18 percent who said they were about the same. Among
those with household incomes of $30,000 to $50,000, 41 percent said
their lives were harder, 33 percent said easier and 26 percent said
about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Some social scientists believe the gap is a measure of what
parents tell their children, and how the information is conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a really interesting class issue,'' said Gina Bria, an
anthropologist at the Institute for Family Development in New York
City. ``In families living close to the bone, parents are more
likely to pass on family stories about how people survived, and in
the process to pass on skills for living. Wealthy kids often have
less of a perspective on the struggles of life. And in some strata,
there is a lot of pressure to keep the family's new-found status,
and children feel the pressure to get into elite schools, to be
sure they don't slide back. Everything's about going forward, about
prosperity. Falling back is the American nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   In later interviews with some of the teen-agers who took part in
the poll, the more affluent said that higher parental expectations,
more pressure for good grades, a faster pace of life and a more
dangerous world made their teen years more stressful than those of
their parents.
</P>
<P>
   It may come as a surprise to parents who came of age in the
druggy 1960s and 1970s, with the Vietnam War raging, but many of
their teen-agers sound wistful, describing their parents'
childhoods as care free, leisurely and safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents both said they felt safe growing up, my dad in Long
Island and my mom in California,'' said Ashley Nielsen, 14, of Alta
Loma, Calif. ``They could do a lot of things we can't do today,
like I don't think they had to worry about things like
hitch-hiking. Sometimes at football games, or when there's a whole
bunch of teen-agers around, I feel a little nervous, like something
could happen. My world is pretty safe, but I know there's a real
world out there. I think there's more peer pressure now than there
was in their time, and more expectations to get good grades. Grades
are the biggest stress for most kids I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Several teen-agers who said their lives were harder described a
steady anxiety about peer pressure and living up to their parents'
academic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was just a lot easier when my parents were growing up,''
said Tommy Shipp, 15, of Houston. ``They didn't have as much peer
pressure to do drugs and all that. There's a lot more pressure to
be popular, and to drink. I've heard my parents talk. My dad's
parents didn't really care what he did; he got kicked out of the
house at 15.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that his father is a highly successful businessman,
Tommy says: ``I'm definitely going to go to college, and they care
about how I'm doing in school.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of the more affluent teen-agers who said life has gotten
harder attributed it to a sense of too-muchness: too many
activities, too many consumer choices, too much to learn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything's gotten harder since my parents were
growing up,'' said Molly Wilhelm, 15, of Lakeville, Minn. ``Back
then, I think everyone was more equal, but now, because there's so
much more offered in styles of clothes and stuff, we all want to
fit in. I think my parents had more free time, and the world isn't
as safe as it was in their day. It's more common for kids to do
drugs and all that stuff. Education gets progressively harder as
people learn more, and there's more to cover. And now that there's
more technology, they expect more out of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many teen-agers from more modest backgrounds view the new
technologies and new opportunities as making their lives easier
than their parents' were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's easier now, because of technology,'' said Ariel
Garcia of Opa-Locka, Fla. ``When you want to do a report, you just
look at the Internet, you don't have to go to the library. Cars
have air-conditioning now, so you're comfortable. There's
microwaves, so it's easy to cook. My dad had it much harder. He's
Dominican, and he was in the Navy. That's tough. I would never go
into the Navy. Those rich kids, they don't appreciate what their
parents do for them. The money just goes through their hands.''
</P>
<P>
   While the more affluent teen-agers portray their parents'
upbringing as easier, and more idyllic, the lower-income youngsters
talk more of the difficulties their parents had to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 13 in my mom's family, and there's only four of us,
and without so many brothers and sisters, my mom can take care of
all of us,'' said Rae-chelle Nunn, 17, of Columbia, Tenn. ``Like my
mom drives me to school, but when she was a kid, she had to walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the richest teen-agers might see their lives as
harder, Ms. Nunn has a quick answer ``They're just spoiled brats,''
she said, laughing. ``But I am too. My mom spoils all of us.''

<P>
   TOKYO _ For those parents frantically beating the pavements to
find yet another pack of $5.99 Pokemon cards, take heart: your
children are unwittingly demanding a healthy dose of Japanese
values.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon, the army of feisty, funny, fantastic cartoon creatures
that has become a smash hit among the under-10 crowd in the United
States and will star in the first Pokemon movie, opening Nov. 12,
stands to become one of Japan's biggest, most successful cultural
exports.
</P>
<P>
   This latest fad follows on the heels of the Tamagochi craze,
which saw the most selfish of children _ and even some adults _
setting aside their own priorities to care for a virtual pet (also
known as a giga-pet), which was programmed to die without their
steady ministrations. Pokemon shows a gentleness and humor that
reflects the best of Japan in a way that high-quality cars and
instant noodles can't.
</P>
<P>
   The cartoon is steeped in traditional Japanese values _
responsibility, empathy, cooperation, obedience, respect for
elders, humility _ that go far beyond its obvious references to
things Japanese. It may sound like the makers of Pokemon cribbed
those themes from Sesame Street, but there is something notably
Japanese in the emphasis on team-building and lending a helping
hand, values that are admired but not always handsomely rewarded in
American society and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese elementary schools strive to instill those values in
their students, placing a premium on their transmission that
exceeds their zeal to teach reading, writing and arithmetic. This
heavy emphasis on socializing children is the bedrock of Japanese
society and is credited, at least in part, with producing the low
rates of juvenile crime rates, teen-age pregnancy and drug abuse
that Japan enjoys.
</P>
<P>
   Let's not pretend that children recognize the show's subtleties.
The aim of Pokemon (the name is short for ``Pocket Monsters''), as
far as they're concerned, is to collect all 151 creatures, become a
master trainer and win battles - none of which, by the way, ever
result in death. Death occurs only when Pokemon trainers, the
humans, fail in their duties.
</P>
<P>
   Ash, Misty and Brock are the central human characters of the
show, and they all understand that capturing a Pokemon is not
enough. Becoming a real trainer takes compassion and
responsibility, although there is a Pokemon Center in town where
ailing Pokemon can go to recuperate if their budding trainers fail
to live up to their obligations _ and where they absorb lectures
about being nice to their Pokemon.
</P>
<P>
   Take the episode where Charmander, a sort-of dinosaur, whose
power lies in its ability to shoot fire from his tail, almost dies.
Charmander's master has abandoned it (Pokemon have no sexual
identity), leaving it sitting in the rain with a tail almost out of
firepower. If the tail goes out, Charmander will die.
</P>
<P>
   But Ash comes to the rescue, even though this particular
Charmander (the name connotes a sort of breed, not an identity) is
not his responsibility. He tolerates jarring electric shocks
emitted by Pikachu, the sassy little yellow Pokemon that is his
sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of patient tending can be seen here at the
playground, where older children tend to look out for younger ones,
to tolerate their piques and help them learn to use the slides and
swings.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Ash and Professor Oak, the ultimate
authority on Pokemon, is very much like that of deshi to sensei, or
student to teacher, the ubiquitous junior-senior relationship that
pervades Japanese institutions. The older sensei offers friendship,
advice and guidance to the deshi, who returns it with gratitude,
respect and loyalty. Even Pikachu rewards Ash's care with unerring
loyalty, and by fighting far stronger Pockemon and suffering
injuries on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The factionalism of Japanese politics, the tradition of
seniority-based pay, the hierarchical nature of organized crime
here all reflect this sensei-deshi relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not Professor Oak who corrects Ash or criticizes him.
Rather, it is Ash's peers who, in classic Japanese style, point out
his errors and run to his assistance when he finds himself in a
jam, as he often does. In the same way that Japanese elementary
school classes have been broken into small groups for problem
solving, Ash and his friends work as a team, resolving their
conflicts without appeal to the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   So as parents brace for the movie, which will surely unleash
another wave of card-trading hysteria, it may be some small comfort
to remember the hidden values. In trading cards, children learn
negotiating skills, cooperation, value judgment and the thrill of
human interaction that is increasingly lost in this virtual, wired
world. Or they learn materialism and cheating. But that's a
non-Pokemon story.

to tolerate their piques and help them learn to use the slides and
swings.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between Ash and Professor Oak, the ultimate
authority on Pokemon, is very much like that of deshi to sensei, or
student to teacher, the ubiquitous junior-senior relationship that
pervades Japanese institutions. The older sensei offers friendship,
advice and guidance to the deshi, who returns it with gratitude,
respect and loyalty. Even Pikachu rewards Ash's care with unerring
loyalty, and by fighting far stronger Pockemon and suffering
injuries on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The factionalism of Japanese politics, the tradition of
seniority-based pay, the hierarchical nature of organized crime
here all reflect this sensei-deshi relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not Professor Oak who corrects Ash or criticizes him.
Rather, it is Ash's peers who, in classic Japanese style, point out
his errors and run to his assistance when he finds himself in a
jam, as he often does. In the same way that Japanese elementary
school classes have been broken into small groups for problem
solving, Ash and his friends work as a team, resolving their
conflicts without appeal to the teacher.
</P>
<P>
   So as parents brace for the movie, which will surely unleash
another wave of card-trading hysteria, it may be some small comfort
to remember the hidden values. In trading cards, children learn
negotiating skills, cooperation, value judgment and the thrill of
human interaction that is increasingly lost in this virtual, wired
world. Or they learn materialism and cheating. But that's a
non-Pokemon story.

   WASHINGTON _ Diplomacy. Sanctions. Bombs. There isn't much the
Clinton administration hasn't tried to rid itself of Saddam Hussein
and Slobodan Milosevic. Now, suddenly, Congress is handing the
administration tens of millions of dollars and demanding that it to
do more.
</P>
<P>
   And so the administration has responded by offering one of the
things it does best: mounting political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq and Serbia, American taxpayer dollars have begun flowing
into the campaign coffers of opposition political parties that, at
best, are sharply divided and even, in the case of the Iraqis, were
at war with one another not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   As it would in America, the money is paying for the nuts and
bolts of campaign organizing _ from office space to telephones to
high-priced consultants. In Serbia, money has gone to that staple
of American politics, polling.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has long lent moral support and money to
political parties overseas, but the scale and ambition of the
efforts in Iraq and Serbia are staggering. In each case, the
administration and Congress are talking about spending as much as
Vice President Al Gore (or former Sen. Bill Bradley) is expected to
spend (more than $100 million) running for the most powerful
political office in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO's air war over Kosovo ended, the administration has
spent nearly $12 million to support Milosevic's political opponents
in Serbia, as well as to nurture independent media and labor
unions. On Thursday, the Senate approved a bill (introduced by the
staunchly anti-interventionist Jesse Helms) to spend up to $100
million more over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   What does this kind of money buy?
</P>
<P>
   In its support of Saddam's fractious opponents, the
administration has spent $8 million this year, most of it just in
trying to get the opposition leaders to work together, let alone
work together against Saddam. Among other things, it has hired the
public relations firm Burson-Marsteller USA and has paid a
Virginia-based firm, Quality Support Inc., to organize conventions,
including a gathering of some 300 opposition leaders in New York
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also announced that it would give the groups
the first $5 million of $97 million in military equipment and
training that Congress authorized last year to speed the overthrow
of Saddam. But instead of surplus weapons and gear like boots, as
Congress called for in the Iraq Liberation Act, the Pentagon is
sending desks, computers and fax machines needed to equip an office
and begin spewing out pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's approach has evoked ridicule on Capitol
Hill and disappointment from those it is supposed to help. Rep.
Benjamin A. Gilman of New York, the Republican chairman of the
House International Relations Committee, derided the idea that
Iraqi exiles ``brandishing fax machines'' could topple Saddam; he
has called for genuine military, not just political, support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only conclude the administration is not very serious
about the policy President Clinton announced with regard to
replacing Saddam's regime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials concede that political support alone is unlikely to
topple two rulers who have tight grips on their countries. American
assistance, after all, can be a double-edged sword, providing help
to opposition politicians but also exposing them to anti-American
backlash. Last week, officials in Serbia and Iraq denounced
opponents who were meeting with American officials, calling them
puppets of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the opposition leaders are divided, often
bitterly so. Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, said he
would offer this advice to Milosevic's opponents in Serbia: ``Maybe
you can have a pause in your macho behavior'' until after
elections. ``Then you can hate each other again in a democratic
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the strategy is a political bind: The administration has
been forced to respond to growing frustration in Congress,
particularly among Republicans, that two demonized foes have
managed to survive and, potentially, to pose new threats. At the
same time, though, there is no Congressional or public support for
using the American military to do the job, the officials say.
</P>
<P>
   That means political support may be the only option left. ``What
else can we do?'' one State Department official asked.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, the ranking Democrat on the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said he supported the
efforts to aid opponents but warned that the United States risked
setting itself a dangerous trap: supporting the opposition leaders,
without having the will to support them militarily if Milosevic or
Saddam turn on them violently.
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what happened in 1996 when Saddam's forces
crushed a cell of dissidents in northern Iraq who were supported by
the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big nations can't bluff,'' Biden said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, administration officials hope that openly
supporting what amount to political campaigns could lead to
peaceful, political transformations. ``In the case of Yugoslavia,
from 1991 on, that assumption has been that politics in some form
would probably be the device that would bring about change,'' James
F. Dobbins, the president's special envoy to the Balkans, said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is another question. Few officials expect American
assistance to have an immediate impact. Sen. John Kerry of
Massachusetts, a Democrat, said that the internal divisions in the
Iraqi opposition and Saddam's ironclad control over the country's
political system and security apparatus, were formidable barriers
to change. ``No one,'' Kerry said, ``should have unrealistic
expectations about what this can accomplish.''

HELL FROM THE CHIEF: HOT TEMPERS AND PRESIDENTIAL TIMBER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   As if presidential candidates don't already have enough tests of
character to worry about _ financial impropriety, drug use,
adultery _ now it seems they have to make nice as well. The Arizona
Republic ran an editorial last week criticizing Sen. John McCain
for his ``volcanic'' temper, claiming that temperament is a
legitimate campaign issue. The Republican responded by accusing the
campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas of helping to plant the
charges against him, which first appeared in The New York Times.
``Do I insult anybody or fly off the handle or anything like
that?'' McCain asked. ``No, I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   But so what if he does? Judging from the behavior of some past
chief executives, a hot temper seems almost a prerequisite for the
Oval Office. Let's go to the presidential biographies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; George Washington wasn't always the dour icon of the dollar
bill. At the Battle of Monmouth, he laced into Gen. Charles Lee for
retreating instead of attacking. Burke Davis explains in ``George
Washington and the American Revolution'' (Random House, 1975):  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Washington roared: ``Whatever your opinions, sir, I expect my
orders to be obeyed! ...'' Lee protested once more that his plan of
attack had been foiled by disobedient subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Others were to recall that Washington cursed Lee in a fury.
General Scott cherished a long memory that Washington ``swore till
the leaves shook on the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; In ``Andrew Jackson and the Course of American Democracy''
(Harper &AMP; Row, 1984), Robert V. Remini recounts a 1836 Cabinet
meeting over a crisis with Mexico: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Without stopping to inquire of the other members what their
advice on the matter would be _ which was his usual procedure _ the
president lashed out in a frightening display of Jacksonian
passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write immediately to Commodore Dallas,'' he barked, ``and
order him to blockade the harbor of Tampico, and to suffer nothing
to enter till they allow him to land and obtain his supplies of
water and communicate with the Consul, and if they touch the hair
of the head of one of our citizens, tell him to batter down and
destroy their town and exterminate its inhabitants from the face of
the earth!''
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet members sat looking at each other in a near state of
shock.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ulysses S. Grant would send thousands of men to their deaths in
the Civil War, but could not abide cruelty to animals. Gen. Horace
Porter, who served with him, recalled in ``Campaigning With Grant''
(1897) what happened when Grant, astride his mount Egypt, saw a man
whipping a team of horses: &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Putting both spurs into Egypt's flanks, he dashed toward the
teamster, and raising his clenched fist, called out to him: ``What
does this conduct mean, you scoundrel? Stop beating those horses!''
The teamster looked at him, and said coolly, as he delivered
another blow aimed at the face of the wheel-horse: ``Well, who's
drivin' this team anyhow _ you or me?'' The general was now
thoroughly angered, and his manner was by no means as angelic as
that of the celestial being who called a halt when Balaam was
disciplining the ass. ``I'll show you, you infernal villain!'' he
cried, shaking his fist in the man's face. Then, calling to an
officer of the escort, he said: ``Take this man in charge, and have
him tied up to a tree for six hours as a punishment for his
brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To end the coal strike of 1902, Theodore Roosevelt contemplated
sending in troops to man the mines. Nathan Miller indicates in
``Theodore Roosevelt: A Life'' (Morrow, 1992) that Roosevelt felt
the spirit of the Framers mattered more than the rights of a few
individuals:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the Constitution of the United States?''
Congressman James E. Watson protested to the president. ``What
about using private property for public purposes without due
process of law?''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt stopped suddenly, took a firm grip on Watson's lapels
and, looking him squarely in the eye, fairly shouted: ``The
Constitution was made for the people and not the people for the
Constitution!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Warren G. Harding was incensed when he learned of corruption at
the Veterans' Bureau under his friend Charles R. Forbes. In ``The
Shadow of Blooming Grove: Warren G. Harding in His Times''
(McGraw-Hill, 1968), Francis Russell depicted him at the boiling
point:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon a visitor to the White House with an
appointment to see the president was directed by mistake to the
second floor. As he approached the Red Room he heard a voice hoarse
with anger and on entering saw Harding throttling a man against the
wall as he shouted: ``You yellow rat! You double-crossing ...''
Whirling about at the visitor's approach, Harding loosed his grip,
and the released man staggered away, his face blotched and
distorted. ``I am sorry,'' Harding said curtly to his visitor.
``You have an appointment. Come into the next room.'' On leaving
the White House, the visitor asked a doorman who it was who had
just gone out after he had come in, and the doorman replied:
``Colonel Forbes of the Veterans' Bureau.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When Harry Truman gave 'em hell, he often did so on paper. He wrote
this memorable letter to Paul Hume, music critic of the Washington
Post, following Hume's devastating review of a 1950 singing recital
by the president's daughter, Margaret:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hume: I've just read your lousy review of Margaret's concert ...
Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new
nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter
below!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lyndon B. Johnson perfected his bullying of subordinates during
his 1948 Senate run. In this scene from ``Means of Ascent'' by
Robert A. Caro (Knopf, 1990), his desire to shake hands with all
the students at a high school is thwarted by an advance man:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have time, sir,'' Carter said, and produced the list
of all the stops he was already scheduled to make. Johnson didn't
even look at the paper; instead, he looked at Carter. As the
principal observed the intensity of Johnson's glare, the hand he
had extended to welcome the candidate slowly dropped to his side.
The smiles faded from the faces of the delegation. There was a long
silence. Then Johnson said, in a low, threatening tone that his
aides feared more than any other: ``Are we gonna join the Can't Do
It Club right here on the steps of Robstown High School?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And what really drives President Clinton up the wall, according
to Dick Morris, his former political adviser, is staff members
leaking executive decisions that make their boss look politically
conniving. Morris writes of the president in ``Behind the Oval
Office'' (Random House, 1997): &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He was red-faced as he yelled, ``I will do this race alone,
alone, alone if I have to'' _ his voice now reaching a higher
octave _ ``to avoid having done to me what was done to me every
week, ev-er-y week, in 1993 and 1994 by my staff and my
consultants. I will not have decisions that I make'' _ his fist now
pounding his chair arm, keeping time with his words _ ``that take
guts, that take courage, where I'm really risking everything, and
have them transformed into'' _ his lips curling in a sneer _
``seamy, seedy, political decisions so some staff member or some
consultant can blow his own horn to look so smart and oh so good to
some journalist. I'll do the race alone first.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I think I got the point.

point:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The next afternoon a visitor to the White House with an
appointment to see the president was directed by mistake to the
second floor. As he approached the Red Room he heard a voice hoarse
with anger and on entering saw Harding throttling a man against the
wall as he shouted: ``You yellow rat! You double-crossing ...''
Whirling about at the visitor's approach, Harding loosed his grip,
and the released man staggered away, his face blotched and
distorted. ``I am sorry,'' Harding said curtly to his visitor.
``You have an appointment. Come into the next room.'' On leaving
the White House, the visitor asked a doorman who it was who had
just gone out after he had come in, and the doorman replied:
``Colonel Forbes of the Veterans' Bureau.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; When Harry Truman gave 'em hell, he often did so on paper. He wrote
this memorable letter to Paul Hume, music critic of the Washington
Post, following Hume's devastating review of a 1950 singing recital
by the president's daughter, Margaret:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hume: I've just read your lousy review of Margaret's concert ...
Some day I hope to meet you. When that happens you'll need a new
nose, a lot of beefsteak for black eyes, and perhaps a supporter
below!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lyndon B. Johnson perfected his bullying of subordinates during
his 1948 Senate run. In this scene from ``Means of Ascent'' by
Robert A. Caro (Knopf, 1990), his desire to shake hands with all
the students at a high school is thwarted by an advance man:  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have time, sir,'' Carter said, and produced the list
of all the stops he was already scheduled to make. Johnson didn't
even look at the paper; instead, he looked at Carter. As the
principal observed the intensity of Johnson's glare, the hand he
had extended to welcome the candidate slowly dropped to his side.
The smiles faded from the faces of the delegation. There was a long
silence. Then Johnson said, in a low, threatening tone that his
aides feared more than any other: ``Are we gonna join the Can't Do
It Club right here on the steps of Robstown High School?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; And what really drives President Clinton up the wall, according
to Dick Morris, his former political adviser, is staff members
leaking executive decisions that make their boss look politically
conniving. Morris writes of the president in ``Behind the Oval
Office'' (Random House, 1997): &LR;
</P>
<P>
   He was red-faced as he yelled, ``I will do this race alone,
alone, alone if I have to'' _ his voice now reaching a higher
octave _ ``to avoid having done to me what was done to me every
week, ev-er-y week, in 1993 and 1994 by my staff and my
consultants. I will not have decisions that I make'' _ his fist now
pounding his chair arm, keeping time with his words _ ``that take
guts, that take courage, where I'm really risking everything, and
have them transformed into'' _ his lips curling in a sneer _
``seamy, seedy, political decisions so some staff member or some
consultant can blow his own horn to look so smart and oh so good to
some journalist. I'll do the race alone first.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, I think I got the point.

NEW YORK'S CABBIES SHOW HOW MULTI-COLORED RACISM CAN BE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It may be the most blatant form of racism in New York
City: a cab driver refusing to pick up someone who is black.
</P>
<P>
   It happens to blacks all the time. Former Mayor David Dinkins
says it has even happened to him. And now the actor Danny Glover,
who last week went public over what he described as a string of
such slights in different areas of Manhattan one night last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so angry,'' Glover told a news conference, recounting
how several empty cabs had refused to stop for him, his college-age
daughter and her roommate. Later, when one finally did, the driver
refused the 6-foot-4 ``Lethal Weapon'' star access to the front
seat even though he has a bad hip and is entitled under taxi
industry rules to stretch out in front.
</P>
<P>
   A simple case of traditional American racism? Perhaps. But in
New York such incidents often have the distinct flavor of the
melting pot: In this case the driver was nonwhite, too _ apparently
from southern Asia, Glover said.
</P>
<P>
   So the actor's experience may illustrate not just continuing
American racism, but one way its character is subtly changing with
demographics: As recent immigrants from Asia, the Middle East and
Africa come to dominate the taxi industry, they are bringing with
them new strains of bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Most often, according to people in the taxi industry, racism is
perpetuated by cabbies whose attitudes have roots not only in
colonial rule and the strict social stratification of their native
lands, but also in the more recent distorted images of the global
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racist images flow throughout the world,'' said Bhairavi
Desai, a native of India and the staff director of the Taxi Workers
Alliance, a 2,000-member drivers' group. Because of the impact of
movies, television and rap music, she said, part of the baggage of
some new immigrants is an established, and sometimes deeply flawed,
attitude toward race.
</P>
<P>
   Among immigrant cabbies from some nations, including India, she
said, ``many of the attitudes stem from a history of colonialism,
and from a sense of competing for bread crumbs with other poor
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no precise breakdown is available, from 60 percent to
70 percent of the city's yellow cab drivers are now immigrants from
India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, according to Allan J. Fromberg,
spokesman for the Taxi and Limousine Commission. Among the other
drivers, people born in the United States or western Europe
comprise a tiny minority compared with the large number of
immigrants from countries like Russia, Korea and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the taxi industry provides a grueling point of entry
to the American work force, and episodes of rudeness and
discrimination sometimes result from a drive to keep the fare box
running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some drivers really don't want to pick up minorities because
they think it will mean ending up in neighborhoods where they won't
be able to find another fare,'' said Edward Rogoff, a Baruch
College professor and longtime taxi industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
   And many cabbies, acutely aware of their high vulnerability to
robbery and attack, undoubtedly take note of higher rates of crime
among lower-income blacks and in certain areas of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few seem to doubt the bigotry factor. Industry executives
note that they are trying to inculcate racial sensitivity among new
immigrant drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyer who accompanied Glover at his press conference,
Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, said such efforts should be broadened.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, McLaughlin, a 20-year veteran of civil rights
litigation and a professor at Pace Law School, said drivers like
the one who antagonized Glover ``have adopted the same patterns of
racial profiling that emerged when when most drivers were were
Irish, Italian-Americans, or from somewhere else in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Acts of racial discrimination by cabbies are illegal, punishable
by a fine or the revocation of the offender's taxi-driver license.
But Scott-McLaughlin, who himself is black, said Glover did not
intend to pursue a formal complaint with the Taxi and Limousine
Commission because he had no interest in punishing a single driver.
(The driver remains unidentified.) Instead, the actor spoke out
last week to focus fresh attention on racism in the taxi industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is educating these people that we are not dangerous
criminals,'' said Scott-McLaughlin.

LEAVING THE FARM FOR THE OTHER REAL WORLD

<P>
   FARGO, N.D. _ To Scott Halley, there was never any question that
he was meant to be a farmer, his life forever set to the rhythms of
planting and harvesting wheat.
</P>
<P>
   But the balance sheet told another story.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the numbers at the end of the pencil,'' said
Halley, 44, ``and you realize it's time to try something
different.''
</P>
<P>
   With a heavy heart, but a clear head, Halley recently joined a
growing trend of American farmers who are voluntarily leaving
agriculture rather than lose money year after year. But what has
surprised many of them is that the transition to urban life has
been so successful. Businesses are eager to hire farmers, who are
often well educated and highly skilled as managers. And their
families often relish the social and cultural offerings in places
where the lights shine brighter.
</P>
<P>
   A century ago, nearly half of all Americans lived on farms and
ranches. Now fewer than 1 in 100 people farm. The winnowing of
their numbers has been chiefly a matter of the food supply
exceeding demand; technological advances, from tractors to
computers, have allowed each acre of land to produce more and more
bushels of grain.
</P>
<P>
   While the resulting decrease in crop prices benefits consumers,
farmers are struggling to survive. Operating on slim margins, only
the largest farms stand a chance of turning a reasonable profit.
Thousands of small farmers sell out every week, typically to a much
larger agricultural enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Since leaving his family's farm in remote Bisbee a year ago to
work as a soil scientist at North Dakota State University here,
Halley has seen the family's income double to more than $40,000.
And the Halleys' three children, who feared leaving rural life and
starting over in suburban West Fargo, have thrived academically and
socially in their new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids would never want to go back now,'' said Halley. ``The
telephone never stops ringing.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent study at Iowa State University found that former
farmers have largely succeeded in building satisfying new lives and
sound financial foundations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that there is life after farming,'' said Fred
Lorenz, a sociologist who worked on the study, which is to be
published in the journal Rural Sociology.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State has begun a program that helps farmers move into
other jobs. While farmers often walk away from the fields with deep
feelings of dejection and failure, they have highly marketable
skills, including working on computers, dealing with financial
markets and running a business. Many farmers under age 50 are
college graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers underestimate their market potential,'' said Bruce
Babcock, an agricultural economist at Iowa State. ``They have a
skill package that's in demand. It's just a matter of convincing
them.''
</P>
<P>
   But even for those who found good jobs, leaving farming exacts a
profound emotional toll, made all the more keen since farmers are
surrendering a way of life that has often been carried on for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just about making money, but about having a life that
is meaningful,'' said Dr. Michael Rosmann, a farmer and
psychologist who counsels farmers. ``For most of them, that
grieving lasts for the rest of their lives. To make the decision to
quit farming, to do what's best for the family, takes an awful lot
of courage.''
</P>
<P>
   Halley, who tended land that had been homesteaded by his wife's
grandfather, feels the pull of the land every day. Once a week he
drives eight hours to work a portion of the farm that has not been
rented to other farmers, just to sustain the bond for a day.
Halley, who earned an economics degree in 1978, is working on
completing a master's degree. His wife, Denise, works for a catalog
company in Fargo.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed on their farm, the Halleys needed to get about $100
from an acre. Nearly 70 percent of that cost was tied to planting _
buying the crop, paying for fertilizer, maintaining machines;
another 10 percent went for overhead and interest payments on the
$130,000 debt for machinery. But with wheat selling for $2.40 a
bushel, with 30 bushels an acre, the Halleys were falling far
short.
</P>
<P>
   Babcock said farmers often succumb to a crisis mode of thinking
_ ``If I can just hang on for one more year, maybe things will get
better.'' Too often the result is a draining of resources until
nothing is left, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today grain prices are at their lowest levels in more than 10
years, even without adjusting for inflation. Farm aid packages
enacted by Congress in the last two years have helped some farmers
stave off failure. Despite the hard times, farmers have not been
whipsawed by the terrible conditions of the 1980s, when land values
fell sharply, interest rates soared and many banks called in their
loans.
</P>
<P>
   The number of full-time farmers in the country has been falling
since the 1930s, to less than 1 million. Iowa alone is losing some
1,500 farmers a year, Babcock said. The typical Iowa farmer earns
between $25,000 and $50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of Iowa's farmers commute to jobs in offices or
factories. It has become unusual for any farm to survive without
some non-farm paycheck, often provided by a wife.
</P>
<P>
   In the Iowa State study of farmers who left the land, incomes
rose, and measures of stress and symptoms of depression declined,
among children as well as parents.
</P>
<P>
   Megan Halley, 13, who transferred from a class of 30 at Rock
Lake School to a class of 400 at West Fargo Middle School, spoke
with excitement about the courses in her new school. She especially
likes art, which was not offered at Rock Lake, and computer
technology. Back on the farm, she said, the antiquated phone system
took five minutes or more just to dial up to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cool here,'' said Megan, who now shops at a nearby Gap,
rollerblades at Skateland and finds the latest releases of one of
her favorite band, Savage Gardens, at the record outlet. The
closest store to the Halleys' Bisbee farm is a 10-mile drive.
</P>
<P>
   Megan had worried she might not fit in with the young people in
her new surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys here aren't any different than back in the country,''
she said. ``There's just a lot more of them.''

   PROGRESS SEEN IN SEARCH FOR CLUES TO EGYPTAIR CRASH
</P>
<P>
   An EgyptAir flight bound for Cairo fell from a moonlit sky early
last Sunday morning, plunging into the Atlantic south of Nantucket
Island and killing all 217 people aboard. So began a painful and
familiar ritual.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives gathered in New York City and Newport, R.I., to seek

the cause. The Navy searched ocean waters for telltale wreckage of
the Boeing 767.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being delayed by stormy seas, investigators made some
progress. The flight data and cockpit voice recorders had been
located. And the synthesis of radar information indicated that the
jumbo jet had twisted and turned in its frighteningly fast descent
_ suggesting an aircraft out of control.

   INDIA STAGGERED BY CYCLONE
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of one of the mightiest cyclones in India's
history, the government tried _ fitfully and often futilely _ to
provide relief to 10 million people affected by the Oct. 29 storm
in the eastern state of Orissa.
</P>
<P>
   The military was stymied by felled trees and buffeting winds,
and was delayed in reaching millions who were stranded in thousands
of villages that have been made all the more remote by flood
waters. Authorities estimated the death toll at 3,000, though they
said that preliminary figure was largely guesswork.

<P>
   VERDICT IN GAY MAN'S DEATH
</P>
<P>
   After a brief trial and 10 hours of deliberation, a Wyoming jury
found Aaron J. McKinney guilty in the 1998 murder of Matthew
Shepard, a gay college student who was found beaten to death and
tied to a prairie fence. The verdict was hailed as a major victory
by gay and lesbian groups because the judge would not allow
McKinney's lawyers to use the so-called gay-panic defense to
maintain that sexual abuse he suffered as a child triggered a
violent reaction against Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   Following a call for mercy from Shepard's parents, McKinney was
spared the death penalty and instead received two consecutive life
sentences.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS EASES BANK LAWS
</P>
<P>
   After decades of trying, Congress finally repealed
Depression-era laws that limited the ability of banks to enter the
securities and insurance industries. President Clinton is expected
to sign the legislation shortly, ushering in a new era on Wall
Street as leading institutions seek partners to become financial
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Passage of the law to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act marked an
end to one of Washington's great gravy trains. In the last
congressional session alone, the industries affected by the bill
poured more than $300 million into lobbying and campaign
fund-raising.

   DISNEY'S GREAT LEAP FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney Co. said it would open its third international theme
park in Hong Kong in 2005. Not since China took back the former
British colony in 1997 has there been so much fuss about a new

<P>
   Disney extracted rich terms for bringing Mickey Mouse to town.
Hong Kong will put up more than $3 billion and be the majority

state-owned enterprise.

   A RULING AGAINST GIULIANI
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge held that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani violated the
First Amendment when he cut public funding to the Brooklyn Museum
of Art for refusing to cancel an exhibition he considers offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the judge had ``lost all reason,'' Giuliani promised to
appeal and renewed his claim that museum officials acted
unethically by raising money for the ``Sensation'' exhibit from
those who have a direct financial stake in the show: contemporary
art dealers, Christie's and Charles Saatchi, the owner of the
``Sensation'' art.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA DEMOCRAT WINS
</P>
<P>
   As the vote tally clicked past midnight, Philadelphia came
closer to ending a half-century of Democratic rule in City Hall.
But finally, by dint of the party machine, former City Council
President John F. Street emerged as the people's choice, just
barely, with 50.2 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   An easier election day was had by Ross Anderson, a civil rights
lawyer and unapologetic liberal, who was elected mayor of Salt Lake
City. In San Francisco, Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr. eluded the defeat
some pollsters predicted and survived for a run-off in December.
</P>
<P>
   7 UTILITIES IN POLLUTION SUIT
</P>
<P>
   Spending $60 million for five new furnaces does not qualify as
``routine maintenance.'' So said the Justice Department and
Environmental Protection Agency as they sued seven big electric
utilities in the Midwest and South, accusing them of polluting the
air by revamping old coal-burning power plants under the guise of
normal upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the utilities have hidden behind grandfather
clauses in the Clean Air Act to avoid spending money for modern
anti-pollution equipment. The utilities denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   MAKER OF DRUG KITS FINED
</P>
<P>
   After six years of warning Abbott Laboratories about
deficiencies in the manufacture of its medical test kits, the Food
and Drug Administration put new restraints on the sale of products
that help detect everything from the virus that causes AIDS to
hepatitis in donated blood. Abbott also agreed to pay a record $100
million to settle accusations that the company failed to meet
federal quality standards when it made a wide variety of test kits.
</P>
<P>
   REPORT CITES MEDICARE FRAUD
</P>
<P>
   For several years, administration officials have boasted of
success in their effort to curtail Medicare fraud. But a report to
Congress from the General Accounting Office suggests that those
claims may be premature.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators told Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine, that
``career criminals and organized criminal groups'' had infiltrated
Medicare and Medicaid. ``This isn't a matter of padding the bill,''
Ms. Collins said. ``It's billing for services that were never
provided. And that is much more pernicious.''
</P>
<P>
   A BLACK EYE FOR BOXING
</P>
<P>
   The founder of the International Boxing Federation and three
other top officials were indicted on charges of receiving bribes
from fighters and their promoters in exchange for manipulating the
federation's rankings to allow boxers to qualify for lucrative
fights. A prosecutor cited the ``culture of corruption'' in the
organization, one of three major international ranking groups for
boxing.

ORDER IN THE COURT! A REVOLUTION IS ON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review)

 By JOHN F. BURNS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ High on the slopes of the Alborz mountains above
the smog-choked heart of Tehran, million-dollar townhouses and
condominiums have sprung up just below the sprawling estate that
housed the shah's winter palace. Here, in the suburbs, is the
Beverley Hills of Iran, an area of high, white walls that give onto
homes with magnificent panoramas, lush gardens and swimming pools.
It is a surreal setting, the kind Antonioni might have chosen for a
film, encoded with messages about the very strange society Iran has
become after 20 years of Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
   Side by side, living as neighbors, are representatives of the
main protagonists in a struggle for Iran's soul. There are the
``formerly privileged,'' in the contemptuous phrase the ruling
clerics use for the old bourgeoisie. There are the new rich, many
of them from the old merchant class, who have built fortunes from
favors granted by the clerics in return for support during the
revolution of 1979. And there are the mullahs themselves, clerics
who have taken over properties confiscated from those among the old
ruling class who did not survive the upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   It was here, last weekend, in a nondescript office building
constructed in the grounds of a confiscated mansion, beside an
empty swimming pool, that the ruling clerics convened a trial that
has become a tableau for the wider struggle going on across Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In the dock was Abdullah Nouri, himself a cleric and until
recently a vice president of the Islamic republic. But it was hard
not to notice a second trial as well: It could be called The People
vs. The Clergy. Even as Mohammed Salimi, a white-turbaned cleric,
starchily admonishes Nouri to show proper respect, millions of
Iranians are judging the court itself, through the blanket press
coverage Iranian newspapers are giving the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri is a man who has helped to shape and lead a reform
movement that aims at curbing the clergy's absolute power. He is
charged before the Iranian equivalent of the Inquisition, the
Special Court for the Clergy, with being an apostate.
</P>
<P>
   Not for nothing has Nouri, 50, been called the Martin Luther of
Iran. Like Luther, Nouri nailed his principles where the clerical
establishment could not ignore them _ in the pages of the country's
most widely circulated reformist newspaper, Khordad, which Nouri
controls. Among other things, he is charged with ``insulting the
sanctities of Islam'' by advocating political reforms that would
undermine the principle of clerical rule. In particular, he would
establish the sovereign right of Iran's 65 million people to choose
their governments, and he is urging the re-establishment of
relations between Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a 44-page indictment that reads like an encyclopedia of
treachery, articles in Khordad are cited as proof that Nouri's
conspiracy to subvert the revolution even extended to advocating
clapping and cheering in public, a taboo under Islamic laws, and to
``propagating'' on behalf of Farah Diba, the shah's widow, by
supporting another newspaper's decision to publish excerpts from
her New Year's greeting to Iran's people.
</P>
<P>
   But after only a week of testimony, many Iranians, and clearly
Nouri himself, have concluded that the trial's significance lies
not in the verdict, but in how it has come to represent the chasm
that has opened up within Iranian society.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is being conducted, bizarrely, in the lobby of the
court building, with reporters perched on a winding staircase to
the upper floors.
</P>
<P>
   It may be years before the world will know which represents the
``real'' Iran _ the medieval process initiated by the mullahs
against the reformer, or the breezy, late 20th-century atmosphere
that invades the courtroom, of reporters in jeans and boat shoes,
with mobile phones, lounging against walls and reading reformist
newspapers replete with articles about the New York Yankees' World
Series triumph and the growing power of internet commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But to an outsider, the sense taken from the courtroom, and from
just about everywhere else in Iran, is that the changes sweeping
the rest of the world cannot be halted at Iran's borders.
</P>
<P>
   Some Iranians see what is happening as a sort of Marxist
dialectic, in which the old and the new are driven into conflict,
driving the historical wheel onward. Certainly, there is an
inexorability in the way in which the conservative mullahs and
their backers have chosen to confront the reformers.
</P>
<P>
   This time last year, the climate of paranoid resistance to
change contributed to the brutal killings in Tehran of five
reformers, including three writers, all of whom had appeared on
death lists circulated by shadowy Islamic groups. Under pressure
from President Mohammed Khatami, the main standard-bearer for
reform along with Nouri, the intelligence ministry was forced to
admit in January that a ``rogue'' group within the ministry had
carried out the killings. Although none of more than 30 people
arrested have gone on trial, and two ring-leaders are said to have
committed suicide in jail, the result, many Iranians believe, has
been to persuade the mullahs that the battle for power must
henceforth be conducted within the law.
</P>
<P>
   Much the same process was visible in the upheaval in July, when
students protesting at the University of Tehran against the closure
of a reformist newspaper were attacked by policemen and vigilantes
who killed three students and ransacked a dormitory. The ensuing
riots were the worst since 1979. Hardliners appeared to have won
the day when they summoned tens of thousands of demonstrators into
the streets. But only four months later, the affair is widely seen
as a Waterloo for the hardliners. Khatami, visiting the rebuilt
dormitory two weeks ago, described the attack on the students as a
``disgraceful, bitter and ugly event'' of a kind Iranians will no
longer tolerate.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Iranians who hanker for greater democracy and human
rights believe it is too late for the mullahs to reverse the tides.
They could send Nouri to jail, depriving reformers of their main
campaigner in parliamentary elections that will be held in
February. Beyond that, the clerics retain the possibility of
violent suppression, since they control the police, the army, and
an array of vigilante and paramilitary groups. But much the same
could have been said for two other ruling elites in the past 10
years, in South Africa and the Soviet Union, and neither survived
the popular will for change.

   Not all Iranians who hanker for greater democracy and human
rights believe it is too late for the mullahs to reverse the tides.
They could send Nouri to jail, depriving reformers of their main
campaigner in parliamentary elections that will be held in
February. Beyond that, the clerics retain the possibility of
violent suppression, since they control the police, the army, and
an array of vigilante and paramilitary groups. But much the same
could have been said for two other ruling elites in the past 10
years, in South Africa and the Soviet Union, and neither survived
the popular will for change.

   Asians, not knowing who or what these strangers were, called
them barbarians. The intruders were Europeans with ruddy faces,
insatiable curiosities and a certain amount of greed who wandered
into the mysterious East in the late Middle Ages. A lot of them
were Portuguese _ pious priests who first penetrated high Himalayan
valleys or the byways of Japan, and storm-hardened seafarers washed
ashore on the steamy beaches of South India, Ceylon, Malaya and the
spice islands of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese were durable. They came, they conquered and they
stayed. And stayed. The last of their Asian colonies will finally
be relinquished in mid-December, when Macau, off the coast of
China, drops quietly into the pocket of Beijing. East Timor, over
which Lisbon asserted residual rights more than two decades after
the territory was seized by Indonesia in 1975, is being adopted by
the United Nations as it moves, at last, toward independence.
</P>
<P>
   First in. Last out.
</P>
<P>
   ``A nice little paradox there,'' said Lucien W. Pye, a political
scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the
author of ``Asian Power and Politics: The Cultural Dimensions of
Authority'' (Harvard). The Portuguese may have opened the doors to
European imperialism and stuck around in some places for a long
time, he said, but they left very little political legacy when
compared with the British or French.
</P>
<P>
   For a small country on the edge of Europe, the Portuguese
created an astonishingly large empire. They did it, initially, for
the sheer adventure of discovery, and for Christianity. A maritime
nation, they threw off Moorish rule early and professed themselves
ready to pursue Muslims zealously to the ends of the Earth, while
excoriating fellow Europeans who didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``But here at least, in this small land of Portugal, there will
not lack those who will do and dare for Christendom,'' wrote Luis
Vaz de Camoens, a 16th-century poet, in the Portuguese national
epic, The Lusiads.
</P>
<P>
   When the Portuguese finished their conquests and conversions,
they had churches as well as trading bases scattered across Asia,
at a time when the spices of the East Indies were the most valuable
commodities in Europe. ``Happily it was possible to serve God and
Mammon at the same time,'' D.G.E. Hall wrote in his classic
``History of Southeast Asia'' (Macmillan). ``By striking at Arab
trade in the Indian Ocean, Portugal aimed a blow at the Ottoman
Empire, which drew the major part of its revenues from the spice
monopoly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Americas, Portugal had the vast colony of Brazil. In
Africa, there was Angola, one of the continent's largest and
potentially richest nations, as well as Mozambique, Cape Verde and
other islands. In India, where Muslims ruled when the Portuguese
arrived, they created Christian Goa, complete with basilicas and
the bones of saints. Goa remained a Portuguese colony for more than
four centuries, until the Indian army seized it without warning in
1961, an act of neo-colonialism that, strangely, never brought down
on India the kind of sustained international retribution Indonesia
would later face in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
   The Portuguese had also dabbled in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, where
the 16th-century King of Kotte was informed by his spies that the
outlandish folks in metal hats and coats who had come ashore seemed
to be picnicking on blood and hunks of whitish stone.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal was ultimately unable to sustain all of its
possessions, especially in Asia. But around the world, elements of
the Portuguese language and Portuguese family and place names live
on, a legacy of a relaxed colonial style _ religious zeal apart.
Portugal, unlike others, did not frown on intermarriage with local
populations. ``There was no color line,'' said Pye. ``No exclusive
clubs. No insults. The Portuguese didn't lord it over as much. They
were gentler, more tolerant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the sad thing is what they left or didn't leave
behind,'' he said. ``They left behind religion, culture. But they
never left behind anything that was political. They never had a
vision for their colonies. They never had the British white man's
burden. They never had the task of modernizing. They didn't have a
sense of mission. There was no grand design. Certainly there was no
end game. It just sort of came to an end because of the Portuguese
revolution back in Lisbon.''
</P>
<P>
   That revolution in 1974 unexpectedly cut loose the remaining
colonies that had not been lost to the Dutch, Spanish or British
over the centuries. Angola and East Timor were suddenly freed _
really left in the lurch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Portuguese stayed too long,'' said Dame Margaret Anstee,
who served as a special envoy of the U.N. secretary-general in
war-ravaged Angola. ``There was no preparation for independence.
There was no transition.'' Indeed, the extended period of colonial
rule allowed divisions to fester among the frustrated and ambitious
anti-colonialist forces.
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor, the Portuguese had left the Roman Catholic Church
in charge of administration. With the Indonesian invasion of 1975,
the church lost its temporal power, which helped make the
disaffected clergy a potent, persistent foe of the Indonesian
government. Indonesia underestimated its power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church played an administrative role for the Portuguese in
a strange kind of way so that the state didn't have to do it,''
said Pye. ``It didn't have to modernize, like in India _ create a
civil service and all that.'' Educational institutions were as
scarce as government institutions. The best and brightest boys were
sent to seminaries. ``One of the things that is striking in terms
of both East Timor and Macao is that the Portuguese have suddenly
realized that they really didn't create any institutions that can
carry on and identify with Portugal,'' he said. Macao's only
university is already run by the Chinese, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil was different. There, by the beginning of the 19th
century, a nation had coalesced. With the help of the British, a
24-year-old exiled Portuguese prince was able to declare the
country independent of the motherland. In 1822, he was crowned
Pedro I, emperor of Brazil. Pedro took the advice of his father,
who _ according to the historian Hubert Herring _ had said: ``If
Brazil demands independence, grant it, but put the crown upon your
own head.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazil thus came of age with a strong national identity as well
as an enduring Portuguese culture, later to be blended with
indigenous American strains as well as African strains, a legacy of
Purtugal's infamous involvement in the slave trade. Brazil
subsequently grew into the largest and most influential of
Portuguese-speaking nations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Brazil is eager to help distant East Timor create a
society true to itself and yet in tune with its history. When the
United Nations looked for the perfect administrator to guide the
East Timorese through the transition, it found a Brazilian, Under
Secretary General Sergio Vieira de Mello. He sees his role as part
of a closing of the circle of colonial history.

WHAT'S IT ALL ABOUT, ALPHA? 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing.) (The Week in Review) 
(jt) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alpha males dominate wolf packs, boss baboon troupes and lord it
over harems of elephant seals. Like other mammals, human groups
also foster alpha males. But though the leadership abilities are
valued, many societies are uncomfortable with other alpha traits,
like aggressiveness, temper tantrums and indiscreet expression of
the drive that spurs the pursuit of alphadom in the first place _
sexual access to plenty of women.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps excessive surprise has greeted reports that Naomi Wolf,
a consultant to Al Gore, told the vice president that he was a beta
male who needed to become an alpha. What stirred the commotion, of
course, is that a feminist writer was caught advising a man to play
out of the male rulebook. Little wonder that Ms. Wolf was furiously
backpedaling last week on the significance (though not the fact) of
her advice.
</P>
<P>
   But her critics miss the point that her proposal was surely
sound. People like the leadership and status that alpha males seek
to possess, and probably would not vote heavily for President Beta.
Besides, the flexibility of human behavior allows alpha males a
range of modes, from the savagery of Genghis Khan to the deftness
of Disraeli.
</P>
<P>
   When biology points one way and culture another, feathers get
ruffled. No one yet knows just how tightly or loosely biological
rules govern human social and political behavior. That is one of
the tasty treats that still lies locked within the human genome
project's hamper box. But those who share 98.5 percent of their
genes with chimpanzees, as people do, would be unwise to bet that
they are totally free of the genetic drives nature built into the
common ancestor of chimps and people.
</P>
<P>
   The most basic of all nature's games is getting as many of one's
genes as possible into the next generation. So it should be no
surprise that reproductive rights are the bottom line of alpha male
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is pursued with tactics of varying subtlety in
different species. The bull elephant seal physically corrals as
many females as he can into his rocky harem. But in most chimp
societies the alpha male combines brute aggression with
sophisticated networking among male and female partners, even
sharing his reproductive rights with kin and henchmen.
</P>
<P>
   With people, the link between biology and behavior is probably
even looser than in chimpanzees, though it is hard to see ourselves
objectively. We assume our societies embody many more and higher
values than mere sexual reproduction and expect our alpha males to
behave accordingly. Yet some primatologists, like Richard Wrangham
of Harvard, see human societies as just one modification of normal
primate biology. The degree of hierarchy is usually far less steep
than in chimp groups, Wrangham notes, because language is a great
leveler, allowing the beta humans to hatch elaborate conspiracies
that temper the tyrant's powers.
</P>
<P>
   In most human societies, there is more room for the sexes to
play out their different agendas. ``Put simply, in our evolutionary
history it seems likely that a woman's value was usually her
reproductive value, and a man's value was his resource value,''
writes Bobbi S. Low of Princeton University in her forthcoming book
``Why Sex Matters'' (Princeton University Press). Her thesis is
that men have always striven to command the wealth or prestige and
that women will seek to assure their children are protected.
</P>
<P>
   Even in today's societies, Dr. Low argues, each sex advertises
the qualities desirable to the other. Men sport gold chains or BMWs
to signal wealth while women, with clothing, cosmetics or
liposuction, strive for the young and healthy look, whose basic
message is reproductive fitness. ``The specifics change across time
and societies, but the desired result does not,'' Dr. Low writes.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much the resource-seeking alpha male depends on
aggression or on conciliation to achieve his goals depends on the
prevailing social expectations. Maybe Ms. Wolf should have told the
vice president to be the more empathetic type of alpha male. That's
the advice he would have gotten from Sarah Blaffer Hrdy, a
primatologist at the University of California, Davis.
``Ethnographers who study hunter-gatherers often report quite a
different style of leadership admired there: the
consensus-building, wise-man mode, with an aversion to discord and
bullying,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in societies that wish their alpha males to wear velvet
gloves, the basic urge is never too far beneath the surface. ``The
search for power is to a large extent independent of any search for
sexual rewards,'' Wrangham said of politicians, ``but it is
dramatic how often power leads to sexual access.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one politician agrees: ``I don't know of a single head
of state who hasn't yielded to some kind of carnal temptation,
small or large.'' Francois Mitterrand said in 1998, toward the end
of a long political career. ``That in itself is reason to govern.''
</P>
<P>
   Whenever license is permitted, political leaders are likely to
indulge their libido. Look at the sexual excesses of Caligula, the
seraglios of the Ottoman sultans, the tribes of children fathered
by potentates like the pharoah Ramses II (52 sons) or the Saudi
king Abdel Aziz (44 sons). Even in Communist China, Mao Tse-tung
consorted with a stream of young girls procured by the Cultural
Work Troupe of the Central Garrison Corps and was never so happy as
when he had several of them sharing his bed, according to the
memoirs of his personal physician, Dr. Li Zhisui.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans do not expect their president to practice lust and
statecraft at the same time. The chief executive must be the model
of monogamous virtue along with all his other roles, and howls of
disapproval greet every slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy, as the Duc de la Rochefoucauld noted, is the tribute
that vice pays to virtue. Ms. Wolf's advice startled because it
embodied the contrary currents in the public's expectations of its
leaders. Strive to dominate, but deny the very urge that spurs the
drive for dominance. It's like demanding that a lion eat lettuce.

king Abdel Aziz (44 sons). Even in Communist China, Mao Tse-tung
consorted with a stream of young girls procured by the Cultural
Work Troupe of the Central Garrison Corps and was never so happy as
when he had several of them sharing his bed, according to the
memoirs of his personal physician, Dr. Li Zhisui.
</P>
<P>
   But Americans do not expect their president to practice lust and
statecraft at the same time. The chief executive must be the model
of monogamous virtue along with all his other roles, and howls of
disapproval greet every slippage.
</P>
<P>
   Hypocrisy, as the Duc de la Rochefoucauld noted, is the tribute
that vice pays to virtue. Ms. Wolf's advice startled because it
embodied the contrary currents in the public's expectations of its
leaders. Strive to dominate, but deny the very urge that spurs the
drive for dominance. It's like demanding that a lion eat lettuce.

</P>
<P>
   EMOTION-CONTROL-REVIEW; COLOMBIA-VIOLENCE-REVIEW.  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PROSPERITY-REVIEW (Undated) _ America is doing well by any
material measure, and for the most part is thoroughly enjoying the
experience. But there are also signs amid the prosperity that
people are asking whether this is all there is. Clearly, the
country seems to be grappling genuinely with with the question of
how it can best put its prosperity to use. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   ALPHA-MALE-REVIEW (Undated) _ A certain consternation has
greeted the news that Naomi Wolf, a consultant to Vice President Al
Gore, advised him he was a beta male who needed to become an alpha.
What stirred the commotion, of course, is that a feminist was
caught advising a man to play out of the male rulebook. But her
critics miss the point that her remedy was surely sound. By
Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-POKEMON-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ For those parents frantically
beating the pavements to find yet another pack of $5.99 Pokemon
cards, take heart: your children are unwittingly demanding a
healthy dose of Japanese values. By Stephanie Strom.
</P>
<P>
   PORTUGAL-REVIEW (United Nations) _ The Portuguese were durable.
They came, they conquered and they stayed. And stayed. The last of
their Asian colonies will finally be relinquished in mid-December,
when Macau, off the coast of China, drops quietly into the pocket
of Beijing. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN-POLICY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Diplomacy. Sanctions.
Bombs. There isn't much the Clinton administration hasn't tried to
rid itself of Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic. Now, suddenly,
Congress is handing the administration tens of millions of dollars
and demanding that it to do more. So the administration has
responded by offering one of the things it does best: mounting
political campaigns. By Steven Lee Myers.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-REVIEW (Tehran) _ It may be years before the world will
know which represents the ``real'' Iran _ the medieval process
initiated by the mullahs against the reformer, or the breezy, late
20th-century atmosphere of mobile phones and Internet commerce. But
to an outsider, the sense is that the changes sweeping the rest of
the world cannot be halted at Iran's borders. By John F. Burns.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ News highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   FARMING-REVIEW (Fargo, N.D.) _ With heavy hearts, growing
numbers of American farmers are voluntarily leaving agriculture
rather than lose money year after year. But what has surprised many
of them is that the transition to urban life has been so easy.
Businesses are eager to hire them for the management skills they
developed during the hard years of farming. By Dirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   TEENAGERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Money doesn't buy happiness _ and
among teen-agers, it may actually make life feel harder. More than
1,000 young people aged 13 to 17 were asked to compare their lives
with what their parents experienced growing up. Over all, 43
percent said they were having a harder time, 33 percent said they
were having an easier time and 23 percent said it was about the
same. At the same time, there was a divide along economic lines,
with the rich children saying they suffered more. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   TEMPERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ A look at presidential temper
tantrums from Washington to Clinton. By Tom Kuntz.
</P>
<P>
   TAXI-BIAS-REVIEW (New York) _ It may be the most blatant form of
racism in New York City: a cab driver refusing to pick up someone
who is black. Actor Danny Glover, who last week went public over a
series of such slights, says he isn't going to take it anymore. By
Thomas J. Lueck.

   WASHINGTON _ The median size of a new house in the United States
just passed 2,000 square feet, 25 percent bigger than two decades
ago. Ford's new Excursion, a $37,000 behemoth of a sport utility
vehicle, is selling out as soon as it reaches dealers. Half of all
households now invest in the stock market. Unemployment is at a
nearly 30-year low.
</P>
<P>
   America is doing well by any material measure, and for the most
part is thoroughly enjoying the experience. But there are also
signs amid the prosperity that people are asking whether this is
all there is, whether driving cars the size of tanks and parking
them in garages the size of gymnasiums is truly the national
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Polling shows that most Americans view themselves as less
cynical and more compassionate than even a few years ago, and that
they are inclined to do more for the less fortunate now that they
have taken care of themselves. There has been a surge in
volunteerism. Charitable giving is up across income levels.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, sociologists and commentators report that
people feel more stressed, that they do not have enough time for
their families, that they sometimes see their quality of life
failing to keep up with their improved finances.
</P>
<P>
   Restless searches for spiritual fulfillment and backlashes
against consumerism are longstanding features of American society,
and are magnified during periods of affluence, when people have the
luxury of looking beyond the next paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   Culture warriors, especially on the right, have long warned of a
dangerous emptiness in the national soul. And it may be that the
whole phenomenon this time around is nothing more than an attempt
by self-absorbed baby boomers to feel better about themselves,
especially given the persistence of the gap between rich and poor
and the unforgiving nature of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the country also seems to be grappling genuinely with the
question of how it can best put its prosperity to use.
</P>
<P>
   There may never be a single or clear answer. But the issues
behind the question are bouncing around Washington and on the
campaign trail with increasing prominence.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of a bitterly partisan presidential scandal, it
is perhaps not surprising that Washington has not yet reached any
consensus. Presented with the opportunity this year to allocate
huge projected surpluses, Congress and the Clinton administration
gridlocked, shunting big ideas from both parties to the sidelines
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seems little doubt of a renewed willingness on the
part of politicians across the ideological spectrum to focus more
on those who have not benefited from the current boom. Less clear
is how big an effort the country is prepared to mount to deal with
such problems.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who twice won office by appealing to the
middle class, spent two days last week touring inner cities, using
some of his dwindling reserves of political capital to draw
attention to ways in which a little bit of public money can
encourage private enterprise to bring jobs and hope to the
country's most blighted neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Republicans accepted an invitation for
Speaker Dennis Hastert to join Clinton in promoting the approach,
which as much as any program illustrates a trend toward small-scale
solutions that look to market forces and individuals rather than
big government.
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination, Bill
Bradley is bucking the trend to some degree. He is suggesting that
government can tackle a few big problems with big programs and lots
of taxpayer money, although even he looks to the private sector and
markets in his plans to alleviate child poverty and improve access
to health care.

 &HT;    Computer co-dependent faces shut-off
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ I have been living in the 1980s for the
past few weeks. For the first time since 1984, there is no computer
at home. My kids consider it equivalent to becoming Amish.
</P>
<P>
   The computer that used to live here _ the fastest, coolest one
I've owned since the day I carried a toylike Atari 800 through the
door _ stopped cold.
</P>
<P>
   And in an anticlimactic, mysterious manner. No grinding of the
hard drive. No shower of sparks. No deep blue error-message screen
Windows critics call the ``Screen of Death.'' Nada. One morning, it
just woke up dead.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer my computer failures to be more satisfyingly dramatic.
I have always enjoyed the way computer failure on ``Star Trek'' is
explosive, as though star-ship computers are powered by kerosene.
But in our boring century, you just keep pushing a button and
nothing happens.
</P>
<P>
   Repetitive button-pushing, by the way, is the universal first
response to all electronic failure. This is similar to the innate
belief that people can make elevators move faster by pushing the
``up'' button more vigorously.
</P>
<P>
   After I sprained my finger stabbing the ``on'' button, I duly
reported the problem to the customer-support department of the
computer's creator.
</P>
<P>
   My decade-and-a-half experience with computer customer-support
departments prepared me for bad things. I filled a thermos with
coffee, got out a sleeping bag, sat by the phone and prepared to
wait them out.
</P>
<P>
   I steeled myself to stay on the phone for any amount of time
they could dish out. I would listen to any amount of background
music. (Yes, even repetitive string versions of ``Close to You.'')
I would write down every option the digital voice would recite at
the speed of a horse-track announcer.
</P>
<P>
   It took time and two cups of coffee, but yes reader, I met a
kindly human.
</P>
<P>
   The kindly human had me do this and that and then pronounced the
power-supply unit dead. But dead under warrantee. The human offered
this deal: mail the computer carcass back to the land of its
creators and the creators would mail a brand-new computer back to
me.
</P>
<P>
   I was delighted. But even in our technologically advanced age,
trucks bearing boxes travel only so fast and land-mail can be slow.
I would be computerless for close to a month. How hard could that
be?
</P>
<P>
   The first days were no problem. In fact, my life improved in
subtle ways. Work could not be brought home. E-mail could not be
read and answered until working hours. I reverted to the ancient
work ethic of working at work and living at my house. This
arrangement has much to recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   Without my home finance program, I experienced the fleeting
feeling of unexpected wealth that comes from checkbook subtraction
errors. Without my computer address book, I misplaced my ex-wife's
phone number. Without the Instant Messenger program, my kids
stopped fighting over the computer.
</P>
<P>
   When I needed to look something up, I went to the library
instead of the Internet, then lazed at a coffee house on my trip
back. Double latte with cocoa.
</P>
<P>
   I noticed the seasons were changing. Life was good.
</P>
<P>
   Still, computerless living got old fast. I wait at the front
door, scanning the horizon for UPS trucks. I feel like a kid
running home from school to see if the decoder ring arrived in the
mail.
</P>
<P>
   This last sentence was written in longhand and copied into the
computer at work. The sentence seemed to end ``see foop decooden
ring amuved ni th mal.'' Longtime computer use atrophied my ability
_ never strong in the first place _ to write words with a pen.
</P>
<P>
   I wish the truck would come. The bills are piling out without
the home finance program to sort them out. I'm lonely for e-mail.
I'm mailing illegible letters with illegible address that will
arrive with postage due to Rangoon instead of Rockledge.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks into computer-free living, I have faced up to facts:
I am a computer co-dependent.
</P>
<P>
   I believe there is a Web site dedicated to curing us. E-mail
support groups, too. After the truck arrives, I'll be sure to check
them out. I put a note in the electronic organizer to remind me to
do so.

 &HT;    A look at games for kids
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's amazing that anything with Barney's mug on
it still exists. There was a time where the purple dinosaur
inspired rage and social backlash. Now, it's the opposite. Barney
is back in favor, in part because of cool toys like Barney's Song
Magic Bongos ($30). The Magic Bongos plays 11 songs in the voices
of five different instruments. All kids have to do is pick their
song (i.e. ``Farmer in the Dell'' among others) and an instrument,
ranging from a steel drum to a hooting organ sound, and start
bonging away. Each hit yields a note and, following that principle,
a bunch of notes/hits play a song. This toy is great for those
creative kids just starting to attain their dexterity, and is also
good for celebrities who insist on dancing around their homes
naked. (800-PLAYSKL)
</P>
<P>
   Bugs Bunny has a problem. On the way to Albuquerque he finds a
time machine. That's not the bad part. The bad part is that he
tries to use it and gets lost in time. In Infogrames' Bugs Bunny:
Lost in Time ($30, for the Playstation), that wascaly wabbit must
travel over five different eras in order to get back to the
present. Along the way, he meets up with favorites such as Elmer
Fudd, Witch Hazel, Yosemite Sam and Marvin the Martian. If nothing
else, this game teaches the kiddies that you shouldn't play with
time machines.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Albert is a little crazy in the head (we'll just
euphemistically call him ``eccentric''), but boy is it fun to poke
around in his stuff! In Uncle Albert's Magical Album ($30, PC and
Mac), you can look through Albert's scrap book and piece together
an assortment of puzzles by flipping through pages and putting
items in the right places; if you find a key you can unlock the
rocket ship game and go on a space journey. Find the picture of the
champ and you can play in the stadium. The game, a bestseller in
France, is handily adapted to the U.S. and runs on Windows PCs and
Macs. It features many small films, eight individual games and a
host of animal friends to play with. (www.vtechsoft.com/album.html)

 &HT;    Knowing how to narrow search important for finding Web data
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We're all searching for something. Unlike in the rest
of life, you're almost certain to find what you are searching for
on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the finding that is difficult on the Web. There your
problem is the enormous volume of references to your search topic
that are returned. Let's say that you just asked for information
about Brazil, since the family is considering a trip there.
</P>
<P>
   The information you need to make a decision on whether to go is
certainly in that long list of sites returned by your favorite
search engine. But along with that, you'll likely find dozens of
duplicated sites _ hits for pages that will tell you about Brazil
nuts and movies with Brazil in the title, and pages that have only
a one-sentence mention of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, today we'll talk about searching the Web and try to
come up with some ways to narrow your search.
</P>
<P>
   One problem you don't have is in finding a search engine. There
are the old reliables such as Yahoo (www.yahoo.com), Excite
(www.excite.com), Infoseek (www.infoseek.com), AltaVista
(www.altavista.com), and a relative newcomer, C/Net's Search.Com at
(search.cnet
</P>
<P>
   .com/). Then there are the sites that let you search using
several search engines at the same time. There's Dogpile at
(www.dogpile
</P>
<P>
   .com); there are pages such as the one at www.alpher.net.au
</P>
<P>
   /search.html that allow you to select the search engines you
want to use from a list, or the All-in-One Search Page at www
</P>
<P>
   .allonesearch.com/.
</P>
<P>
   You'll soon discover, if you are new to search engines, that
they are not all created equally. Search engines are like baseball
players; they're specialists that have different strengths and
weaknesses. Some search engines such as Yahoo are great for times
when you are using the Web to find something of general interest.
For instance, if you want to find out about a specific city, or
read the history of World War II, or learn more about Thomas
Edison, Yahoo is an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be times when you have a really narrow search and
the topic isn't something as common or popular as the examples
above. Let's say that you are looking for an old friend named Bill
Husted. Bill isn't famous and is unlikely to have much written
about him.
</P>
<P>
   That's when AltaVista comes in handy. Since it (unlike Yahoo)
searches the text of the Web pages it returns, even a single
reference to Husted will be enough to get a hit. You can see why
the strength of AltaVista (the ability to scan every word) would be
a real liability if you were looking for information about Germany
in World War II. A broader search would give you a hit on each page
that mentioned those words. That's too much.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of too much, some search engines search only a portion
of the Web. The problem is that there are so many sites out there,
and many of them are not indexed by the major search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the problem of too muchness is what you may run into
on the multiple search engine sites. On the other hand, when you
are seeking hard-to-find information and don't mind the hassle of
getting some hits that are off-topic, the multiple search engines
(my favorite is Dogpile, mentioned above) can do a fine job.
</P>
<P>
   In the Web's early days, almost all search engines (there were
search engines used by researchers and academics that were notable
exceptions) were general purpose. Nowadays there's a trend toward
specialized search engines. Lycos, for instance, has a specialized
search engine at richmedia.lycos.com/ that will search out MP3
audio music, videos or electronic images.
</P>
<P>
   That's just an example since the Web is full of sites like that
these days. There are search engines specializing in finding
shareware (www.shareware
</P>
<P>
   .com); even for finding jokes (www.ezinecenter.com/Jokes
</P>
<P>
   andHumor/more2.html), and real estate listings (www.gts.com
</P>
<P>
   .tw/english/business/companies
</P>
<P>
   /real/).
</P>
<P>
   The secret is to first define your search and then to search for
a site that does the best job for that type of search.

 &HT;    Internet2 steers toward innovation
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last month, almost 30 years to the day after
Stanford University first logged onto a revolutionary 50
kilobits-per-second computer network, a new generation of Stanford
researchers sent video clips across a connection that was 48,000
times faster.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford zapped a continuous 40-minute feed of high-definition
television footage to a wall-sized screen in Seattle, where a rapt
crowd of 800 university and corporate Internet experts watched a
crystal-clear, real-time broadcast unfettered by Internet traffic
jams.
</P>
<P>
   Except that the broadcast didn't come across the Internet as we
know it.
</P>
<P>
   This clip zoomed across a superfast private network built for
the so-called Internet2 project, for which a group of universities
and technology companies are developing programs for the next wave
of bigger, better, faster Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AM radio is today's Internet, then the technologies and
applications Internet2 is focused on are like high-definition color
TV with stereo surround-sound,'' said Greg Wood of the nonprofit
University Corporation of Advanced Internet Development, an
umbrella group coordinating Internet2 members. ``It's not just
better or really good. It's a completely different means of
communicating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 12 meeting of the Internet2 minds underscored the
project's emphasis on multimedia, viewed as the most fertile ground
for growing today's commercial Internet into tomorrow's powerful
and highly interactive entertainment, social and educational
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The HDTV movie broadcast in Seattle was one of several
demonstrations showing just how fast the online future could be.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd watched a band of Native American dancers in Alaska
perform on a live high-definition broadcast. Later, a virtuoso in
Washington gave personalized instructions to a music student in
Oklahoma. In the finale, a dancer, a musician, a poet and an
artist, sitting in four corners of the country, created and
choreographed a production featuring performers in Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visual elements were all finely articulated, and it was
all live over the Internet,'' said Martha Russell, who as assistant
dean of the College of Communication at the University of Texas at
Austin attended the Seattle summit. ``We're creating new technical
and social frontiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet2 began in 1996, when 34 universities sought National
Science Foundation grants to connect to a very high-speed backbone
network created by the government agency and MCI Communications
Corp., now MCI WorldCom Inc. The Internet's explosive commercial
growth made it impossible to test advanced applications, the
schools argued, because too many users and information transfers
kept clogging the pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The group proposed a private network linking only member
institutions, guaranteeing easy access and maximum network speeds,
and also letting researchers test technologies without disrupting
the widely used commercial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the tech business, it's a 'Field of Dreams' issue,'' said
Bill Bard, who helped UT connect to the Internet in 1972 and who is
now director of Academic Computing and Instructional Technology
Services at UT. ``We figure if we build one of these things, people
and applications will come.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation agreed, offering two-year,
$350,000 grants to entice other institutions to join the new
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Internet2 membership swelled to 163 universities _ 10
in Texas, including UT _ and 60 corporate sponsors, all donating
time, money and manpower in exchange for an all-access pass to a
limitless technological playground. Cisco Systems Inc., one of the
biggest contributors, has donated about $15 million to date in
routers, switches and software that help handle network traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest Communications Inc. is helping solidify the foundation. In
March, the Denver-based company switched on a $500 million
high-speed backbone that will be the main coast-to-coast network
available to Internet2 universities.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's Abilene Network, named for the Kansas city at its
midpoint, is capable of moving 2.4 gigabits of data per second _
the fastest speed available today. Qwest donated Abilene to
Internet2 for five years. ``Internet2 is rapidly becoming a
catalyst for application development and progress with the
Internet,'' said Guy Cook, Qwest's vice-president of Internet
services. ``This gives us a unique, direct window on all the
emerging intellectual capital and research-and-development
activities happening in this realm.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a push for richer, more in-depth Web content,
researchers have used their high-bandwidth test-bed to toy with
three-dimensional graphics and imaging technology. From there, the
possibilities broaden to everything from collaborative surgery to
virtual-reality rooms evocative of science fiction novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're turning up the social volume, dealing with more
computer-mediated environments,'' Russell said. ``With the speed
and the capabilities technology will bring, the only limiting
factor may be human cognitive bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   STARTING GATE
</P>
<P>
   If the origins of Internet2 and its network sound familiar, it's
because a similar scenario played out three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, the federally funded Advanced Research Projects Agency
created its namesake ARPAnet to test whether computers could
exchange information across a network. The 50 kilobit-per-second
ARPAnet linked four U.S. universities: Stanford, the University of
California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa
Barbara and the University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ARPAnet spawned a series of coast-to-coast networks that
connected educational institutions and which later merged into the
present-day Internet. The ARPAnet spawned technological inventions
like e-mail in 1972 and the World Wide Web in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's Internet is successful because it went through that
large-scale testing,'' Wood said. ``It proved these technologies
could be widely deployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Envisioning potential profits, companies quickly came knocking.
In 1991, the National Science Foundation agreed to allow commercial
use of its network.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, it left universities and other researchers without
a test network to call their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It posed the question, 'What happens to all the research we're
doing?''' Bard said. ``A lot of institutions still wanted to keep
up with the hunt for the next Killer App.''
</P>
<P>
   From similar thinking at universities around the country,
Internet2 was born.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for a minimum investment of $500,000 per year, member
universities connect to either the MCI network owned by the
National Science Foundation or the recently donated Qwest backbone.
</P>
<P>
   A juiced-up clone of its research-oriented predecessor, the fast
Internet2 network gives companies and universities the freedom to
test high-tech innovations such as Web-conferenced college classes
without sweating the logistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to keep it separate because commercial service
providers aren't interested in experimenting with new technology
that could cause hiccups in the system,'' said Michael Turzanski of
Cisco Systems Inc.'s Advanced Internet Initiatives department.
``This way, if it breaks down, it's not as much a crisis as if
America Online breaks down _ and if it breaks, it gives us
something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite origins that closely mirror today's Internet, insiders
say the apparent cyber-circle of life probably won't repeat itself.
With the commercial Internet thriving and maturing at its own pace
_ the pace of its users _ the Internet2 networks can likely stay
private and a few gigabits ahead of the mainstream Internet without
ever actually supplanting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years from now, there will be a whole new set of
challenges for us to focus on,'' Wood said. ``The point of
Internet2 is to commercialize our technologies, but not the network
itself so we can still use it to meet those challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   PIPE DREAMS
</P>
<P>
   But for the average user, Internet2 technologies are pipe dreams
until current Internet technology gets up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   Some phone companies and service providers are taking big steps
toward beefing up available bandwidth. SBC Communications Corp. is
planning to spend $6 billion to upgrade its Asymmetrical Direct
Subscriber Lines, or ADSL, so that 80 percent of its customers can
get those always-on Internet connections. Offered at either 1.5 or
7 megabits-per-second, ADSL connections are competitive with Time
Warner Inc.'s cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   But traffic still poses problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Abilene Network guarantees end-to-end performance, meaning
downloads are fast and uninterrupted regardless of how many users
log on at a given time. In the real Internet world, there are no
such promises.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Internet2 point out that technology developed on a
high-speed private network with limited users might not transfer
well onto the commercial Internet _ even if it gets bigger and
faster and better in the future. That's because the commercial
Internet as we know it isn't limited to just 163 schools, but to
millions of users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   So at least for now, some of the sexier Internet2 applications
might have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable and DSL are raising the bar, but that's not enough,''
said Turzanski of Cisco. ``The reality is that yes, we're going to
need a whole lot more bandwidth, and it's got to be more
intelligent bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is studying a solution involving smarter management of
network traffic, whereby anyone making high demands on the network
_ like downloading the HDTV clip _ could get extra bandwidth for a
set amount of time, borrowing from users simply surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Oregon used the recent Net Aid concert to test
another technique for cutting traffic. Currently, servers respond
to requests for streaming video by sending one stream to each user
across the national network, creating huge traffic jams like the
one that last year stalled a live Victoria's Secret online fashion
show.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Oregon Internet2 team multicast Net Aid footage. It
sent one copy across the national network, and routers at each
member school knew to capture and copy the feed based on the number
of local users who wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who wanted a copy got one,'' he said. ``We could do
it over Abilene, but we can't do it with regular Net Aid servers
because all the networks in between aren't enabled. It would have
crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brave new world
</P>
<P>
   When broadband connections catch on, the first Internet2
technology that becomes available will likely be multimedia
megaprograms that create interactive social situations from
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   That could carry with it a new set of interpersonal challenges,
as future generations inherit a medium that can build relationships
by giving voices and real-time conversations to e-mail pen-pals,
according to Russell of the UT College of Communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a phenomenal opportunity for work groups to
collaborate across space and time,'' Russell said. ``But people are
hard-wired to communicate with other people, so the software and
hardware has to make things conducive to the trust and
understanding people need for collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell cited interactive distance-learning as one of the most
practical applications of high-bandwidth real-time Web conferencing
tested at the Seattle Internet2 member meeting. She also pointed to
social and political issues surrounding the definition of what's
public and what's private on an Internet that's no longer faceless
or anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   It could also introduce distance-based living, Russell said. For
families in which one or both parents travel frequently,
Web-enabled face-to-face interactions could shape the ways children
develop and maintain bonds with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers went a step further, theorizing that bandwidth
might one day transmit smell, touch, even taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be so cool to get on the Internet and have the scent
of a pepperoni pizza delivered, or feel a brand-new leather
jacket,'' said Wood of the Internet2 research group. ``We can't
digitize that stuff now, but in the future, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the advanced, real-time applications
that researchers hope will be part of the Internet's future:
</P>
<P>
   _ Long-distance surgery. Specialists could watch and consult on
an operation across the Internet, advising the surgeons about
specific problems and reducing the need for on-site specialists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Real-time collaboration. Engineers and designers, working in
different cities, could tweak blueprints for things such as planes,
vehicles or even buildings. Scientists could watch each other's
experiments and share data, and doctors could transmit X-rays or
charts to each other for second and third opinions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teleimmersion. A person would walk into a small room right out
of `Star Trek,' don 3-D virtual reality goggles and communicate
with someone in the same type of room on the other side of the
world. This technology, on the high-end of Internet2 research, also
incorporates the sense of touch.

 &HT;    IriScan's software, camera systems look security in the eye
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After almost a decade of quietly testing and
tweaking its technology, IriScan Inc. is ready for the world to
look the future in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's cameras will be staring right back.
</P>
<P>
   IriScan makes software and small video cameras that can identify
a person based on a quick glimpse of his or her iris _ the eye's
colored ring surrounding the pupil.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing customers to shell out thousands of dollars for iris
scanning equipment and give up time-tested methods like
identification cards and fingerprints won't be easy, but in May,
the company's technology took a big step toward the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Bank United Corp. installed automated teller
machines in Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth, each equipped with
iris-recognition systems that replace the need for carrying cards
and punching in pass codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social security numbers, bank cards and drivers licenses
aren't secure, so if someone gets that information, they can do
things in your name,'' said spokeswoman Kelly Gates of New
Jersey-based IriScan. ``The only way to protect this information
and make sure the right person is doing the right thing is to tie
that activity to something that you are.''
</P>
<P>
   IriScan started developing its technology in 1990. But the
market for eyeball IDs didn't catch up with the company until the
advent of the Internet, which both increased availability of
information and put a premium on keeping it as safe as possible,
Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   And in biometrics _ the science of linking one's identity to an
innate physical characteristic _ the more foolproof, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The iris is widely thought to be the most unique part of the
human body, with more than 260 different places in which the tissue
patterns can vary.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of two people having identical irises is a number so
miniscule it defies comprehension _ take the number 10, pencil in
77 more zeros, and that's how many people to sort through before
you'd find two people with like irises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could well be the most accurate biometric, with strong
potential as a security technique,'' said Jackie Fenn, an analyst
at GartnerGroup Inc. ``With fingerprints, you're looking at
minutiae and a few key features. But with the iris, there's tons of
unique information.''
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of using the iris for personal identification is
its immunity to both biology and outside forces. Fingerprints are
in constant contact with elements that can affect their appearance,
and voice patterns change based on anything from illness to simple
maturation. Conversely, the iris develops within an infant's first
three months and retains those characteristics for life.
</P>
<P>
   Sensar Inc., which built the ATM iris-recognition equipment
around IriScan's technology, plans to make it compact enough to be
embedded within devices such as personal computers, airport
security scanners and safe-deposit boxes. Already, a jail in
Sarasota, Fla., uses iris-recognition as a security measure.
</P>
<P>
   Using the eye itself as a security tool isn't altogether new.
Government agencies have used retina scanning for years to monitor
access to their high-security areas and information systems.
</P>
<P>
   But retina scanning never took off commercially because it
seemed too intrusive, Fenn said. It requires that a person stand
close to the unit, which shines a visible laser beam to the retina
at the back of the eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That infrared light in the eye really turns people off,'' Fenn
said. ``That's a technology that won't take off even if it's
mass-marketed.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the iris-recognition systems involve capturing a
video image of the person's iris. Software divides the iris image
into smaller ringed segments, translating each into digital code
that's matched against a previously recorded and stored iris
profile. The whole process takes less than three seconds, according
to IriScan.
</P>
<P>
   But speed might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   To win over consumers, iris scanning needs to be as simple as
possible for people to use, so IriScan began licensing its
technology in 1995 to companies that are exploring its commercial
potential.
</P>
<P>
   The ATMs in Texas, plus a handful in Europe, use
iris-recognition cameras made by New Jersey-based Sensar, formerly
part of RCA Electronics. Sensar used RCA's imaging technology to
make a camera that can interpret the iris from a greater distance
than IriScan's original model.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it does that for a price. The Sensar equipment can
accurately recognize an iris from 3 feet away even when it's
shielded by glasses or contact lenses _ all for what Fenn said is a
fairly hefty $3,000 per unit. Sensar and Diebold Inc., an
Ohio-based maker of ATMs, plan to build 10,000 machines to see
whether the technology is popular and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But it's little refinements like those that could make consumers
comfortable enough to embrace iris-recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to stick your finger on a glass plate,'' said
Fenn of GartnerGroup. ``If iris scanning gets that easy, where
people can use it without thinking about it, then it could really
take off. But that's a good three to five years away.''

 &HT;    The cyber-mall is waiting to help you with your holiday shopping
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't all those Internet pundits see how obvious it is
that lots of people will be shopping online this holiday season?
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: Even people who absolutely hate shopping are
forced to do it at Christmas. Anyone who's ever had to fight his or
her way through Toys ``R'' Us or Victoria's Secret at Christmastime
knows this all too well.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the episode of the TV show ``Friends'' in which one of
the characters, probably Joey, forgot all about Christmas and
bought everyone presents from a gas station? Somebody got
windshield wipers; someone else got an air filter.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that people get desperate during the holidays.
They'll buy almost anything from anyone as time begins to run out.
</P>
<P>
   So the idea that people will be shopping online this year is
really a no-brainer. Do you really want to spend the 12 days of
Christmas trekking through every bookstore in town to find that
fly-fishing book your husband keeps yakking about? Of course you
don't. Why not just sit down at your computer, log on to an online
bookseller, have them find the book, gift-wrap it and drop it on
your doorstep? And it comes in the nifty UPS box, so if your
beloved asks you what came in the mail, you can smile sweetly and
say ``Oh, this? It's a `Cooking with Soy' book. We really don't eat
enough tofu, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   It's foolproof _ not even the most curious member of your family
is going to try to rip open a UPS package. First of all, anyone
who's tried knows it's not really possible without power tools.
Secondly, unless you work for UPS, you don't have the equipment to
return the packages to their just-delivered state. You will be
found out, and you will be presentless.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if shopping at home is some wacky new idea that only
Web geeks and Microsoft employees can figure out. People have been
sitting comfortably catalogshopping and phoning up those cable
home-shopping channels for years. Now that most companies have at
least one computer hooked up to the Web, the end-of-the-millennium
holiday shopper can probably find his way to an online retailer and
place an order with little or no difficulty. It's hard to find a TV
show, newspaper or magazine that isn't stuffed with ads for
``Dot-com'' retailers urging you to get online.
</P>
<P>
   Online retailers say they've learned tons from last year's
surprise Christmas onslaught. More than just posting a list of
goods for sale, they finally understand that the Web offers more
opportunity for personalization and interaction than a catalog or a
retail store.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly for the novice e-shopper, retailers you know
and trust in the real world such as Nordstrom, Macy's, Neiman
Marcus, The Gap, Barnes &AMP; Noble, even speciality stores like The
Museum Co. and cosmetic companies such as Clinique and Bobbi Brown,
have all set up shop online. Each offers faithful consumers the
opportunity to bypass the crowds and do their holiday shopping by
the festive glow of their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites offer very detailed and easy-to-read privacy
statements that you should read before you begin any online
shopping adventure. Any reputable site will promise security
measures to keep your credit card numbers safe. They'll also
promise not to give out any personal information you provide them
to any Internet con artists who ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   Converts to the wonders of online shopping will tell you that
the Web offers consumers much more besides convenience. There are
``wish lists'' users can create to help confused but
well-intentioned gift-givers pick out something you might really
enjoy. Other sites provide online ``personal shoppers.'' Type in
the person, the occasion, some information about their likes and
dislikes and a price range and you'll get several suggestions that
might fit the bill. If you find a retailer you like, you can often
select ``one click ordering option'' that will store your personal
information so you don't have to enter it over and over. It saves
time and provides extra security.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not shopping online yet, don't worry. The mall won't
be closing any time soon. But as the holidays draw closer, going
online is clearly better than last-minute shopping at the gas
station.

 &HT;    Surfing at work? Start here
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having Internet access at work is like having a
television on your desk, only cooler. The studies show that online
prime time for the Net is the daytime.
</P>
<P>
   People are online the most while they are at work. Checking
stock quotes. Reading movie reviews. Scanning NFL injury reports to
set fantasy football lineups. Checking Internet e-mail in-boxes.
</P>
<P>
   All while they should be working.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.ishouldbeworking.com, is nice and brazen about
the people's online slacking. People are on the Web when they
should be working, so if people are going to do it, the site
argues, why not do it here?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the welcome message states, ``This Web site is dedicated
to slackers, goof-offs, procrastinators, loafers, `long-lunchers,'
and Web-addicted employees worldwide. You should probably be doing
something else right now, but as long as you're here, have some
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The site offers discussion groups, games and jokes. It also
includes a panic button on every page in the site. If your boss is
walking by, press it and immediately (or as long as it takes to
download) a business-oriented Web site appears.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes practical tools as well. One page offers links
to several online job-hunting sites. Another provides links to
alcoholic drink databases, and one offers links to travel planning
sites.
</P>
<P>
   COOKING LIGHT SITE HAS HEALTH TIPS, MORE
</P>
<P>
   We've heard all the excuses: You're too busy to eat right and
too overworked to burn off the excess from the food you shouldn't
be eating because you're too busy in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's one less excuse. The folks at Cooking Light magazine
improved their Web site, www.cookinglight.com. The only drawback to
the site is the annoying pop-up box, ``welcoming'' you to the site.
But that can easily be removed with a click.
</P>
<P>
   The new site includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nutritional information that lets you search recipes by fat
content or the percentage of calories, carbohydrates, sodium and
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twice as many recipes as the original site. Some 2,000 recipes
are included. Each is linked to dishes included as part of
last-minute menu ideas.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new, faster search engine to help find recipes when all you
know is one word.
</P>
<P>
   _ A feature called My Recipe Box, which lets you keep an online
collection of your favorite recipes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Clueless Gourmet is geared toward someone who doesn't know
much about cooking but wants to make it seem like they do. The
selections come with tips to create ambience and advice on how to
select the fruits and vegetables in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   LOCATE THAT HARD-TO-FIND RENTAL MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   So you want to rent an old Albert Brooks movie. But you live in
the Deep South, not exactly the holy land for movies written by and
starring a somewhat whiny, neurotic Californian. You have a few
options: You can drive to the video stores near your home and see
if they carry ``Lost in America.'' You can call and ask. Or you can
take advantage of a Web site designed to help you find hard-to-find
movies to rent.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.formovies.com, has a search engine that lets you
type in the name of a movie and your ZIP code. After a few seconds,
it lists the phone number and address of video rental stores near
your house that carry the movie you want. A recent search on ``Lost
in America'' using a ZIP code in metro Atlanta turned up 12 video
stores, five of which were a short drive.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes more than 9,000 video stores and 160,000 movie
titles in its database. You can search for video cassettes, DVDs
and video games. You can search by movie title, actor, directory or
category.
</P>
<P>
   THE LATEST THINGS IN NET MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Web listening: RCA's Lyra 2201 is an MP3 player that offers the
versatility of handling different formats. The RaveMP 2100 not only
looks cool but also adds a built-in microphone for four hours of
voice recording. The Rio 500, successor to the original MP3 player,
greatly improves on capacity and features.

 &HT;    Everybody has questions or answers on reformatting
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I was on vacation when I engaged in the Herculean
struggles with my hard drive described in the past two reports, so
all the messages pointing out my blunder didn't reach me.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is good to be able to say that on the second
go-round, I did discover that it was unnecessary to install Windows
95 before installing 98.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers, however, had questions rather than advice, and
I'll try to answer some of them here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you reformat the hard drive by upgrading your BIOS with a
more current version known as BIOS flashing? Also, I'm going to buy
an Uninstall program from Norton that helps me find many of those
programs and files that get lost and need to be deleted to increase
hard drive space and performance.
</P>
<P>
   A: Formatting the hard drive has nothing to do with a BIOS
upgrade. Formatting the hard drive is accomplished using the FORMAT
command and simply wipes the drive clean, sort of like taking an
eraser to a blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   The program to which you refer is Norton's CleanSweep. Let me
suggest that you buy SystemWorks, which includes CleanSweep and a
lot more good stuff, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the command used to format the hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way I do it is to go to the DOS prompt and enter the
command ``format,'' followed by the drive designation, i.e.:
``format c:''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I also own a Compaq 7212 and made the set of system disks.
Will these 30 disks be all that I need to load Windows 95 on my new
computer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I couldn't say without seeing what's on the disks, but I
would suggest staying entirely legal and much more modern by going
to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will formatting the hard drive cause me to lose DOS?
</P>
<P>
   A: You bet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about CMOS settings, etc.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't worry about them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You wrote that you backed up your hard disk ``by a direct
connection via parallel port.'' How did you do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the communications section of the Windows 98 accessories,
there is a provision for setting up a direct cable connection to
another computer. I seem to remember it was available in 95, too,
but I'm not sure. If not, there are plenty of programs, such as
LapLink, that will do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Exactly what are ``registry files,'' and how can I find a
program that will copy and store them? Do you have one registry
file for your hard drive, or do you have one for each program on
the hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is only one registry file, which contains critical
information about each program on the drive, and it basically
replaces the old WIN.INI file of Windows 3.x. Don't bother looking
for it with Explorer because it's invisible. Don't mess with it,
either. Norton SystemWorks not only contains a program for storing
copies of the Registry but one that will detect and correct simple
problems in it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your opinion, when performing a backup of the hard drive,
is it best to back up the entire drive, including program files, or
just the data files?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can reinstall the program files, but remember that you
want to save things like your browser bookmarks and your e-mail
address book. Otherwise you really need only back up your data
files.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I use the drag and drop technique to move some programs
from C: to D:, will they actually be physically moved so that they
will not be deleted on reformatting C:?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to verify the serial number of the Windows OS
I've loaded so I can ensure to use the proper CD for
reinstallation?
</P>
<P>
   A: What, you've got a collection of them? I can find no way to
figure out which one is installed, and I suspect that's the way
Microsoft wanted it.

 &HT;    Health Web site alliance agrees on timetable
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The coalition of leaders of top Internet health
sites assembled by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said this
week it had taken its first steps to address the lack of ethical
standards in the new industry and made plans for regular
discussions over the next five months.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of 16 companies, including WebMD Inc., Healtheon
Corp., Medscape Inc., America Online Inc. and Austin's drkoop.com
Inc., met this week and formed working groups that will create
policies for advertising, privacy and content. The small groups
will meet weekly and the entire coalition _ dubbed the Hi-Ethics
Alliance _ will meet once a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to discuss the issues, but we didn't come up with
anything,'' said Donald Kemper, chief executive of Healthwise Inc.,
an Idaho nonprofit group that runs a health site. ``It's too early
to say what things will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders expect to release a set of ethical principles by the end
of March, Kemper said.
</P>
<P>
   Health sites around the country have taken heat in medical
circles for creating potential conflicts of interest, providing
inaccurate information and offering diagnoses and prescribing drugs
online.
</P>
<P>
   Koop, chairman of drkoop.com, called the company leaders
together last month, but he won't play an active role in the group
despite having drawn some of the harshest criticism for perceived
ethical lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Drkoop.com, the most popular health site on the Internet, has
been judged as one of the most reliable, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, leaders of the American Medical Association
criticized Koop for not providing enough information about
sponsorship and commerce arrangements on the site, which derives
much of its revenue from advertising. Koop, who developed a
reputation as a tough public health advocate, was criticized last
week for telling Congress in March that medical latex gloves were
safe without disclosing that he had once been a paid consultant to
a major latex glove manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hackett, drkoop.com's chief executive, represented the
company on the alliance and was tapped to head the advertising
group, which has already agreed that health sites should not accept
advertising from tobacco, alcoholic beverage or firearms companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals there are to ensure that we have very high standards
and principles regarding the separation between church and state,
between content and advertising,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear what impact the guidelines will have on the
estimated 15,000 health sites on the Internet, Kemper said he
believes they all could stand to raise their standards and solidify
their policies on ethics and credibility. For example, he would
like to see content on Healthwise.com include more detail on the
source of the information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a shame that we didn't do this earlier so
people had clear guidelines as to what was appropriate and what was
not,'' Kemper said. ``Everybody's been working kind of blind as to
what standard operating procedure should be.''

 &HT;    Let your own needs, not price, rule your computer selection
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The newspapers are full of ads for computers that seem
to be priced impossibly low. I've seen new computers for $400 or
so, and prices around the $600 mark are common. Even fairly
powerful PCs are advertised right at the $1,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   With rare exceptions, however, and despite what you probably
think, the price for a computer hasn't really changed much over the
years. Now, before you start calling my boss demanding that I be
given a drug and sanity test, let me explain my theory on buying
computers.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the most sense to me to buy a PC that is nearly at the
top of the pecking order when it comes to power and memory. You
tend to pay too much of a premium for the very fastest,
state-of-the-art computer. And computers at the other end of the
spectrum get outdated too quickly and also are unable to run all
the applications and games that you might choose.
</P>
<P>
   If you price this computer _ the one that is just one step below
the hottest machine out there _ my guess is that you'll pay
somewhere between $1,500 and $2,000 if you get it and an excellent
monitor. That's the same price range that you'd have found five
years ago, or even 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now the computer itself will be much more powerful than what you
would have gotten for the same amount of money even four months
ago. But that's always been true, too. If microwave ovens improved
in performance as fast as computers, your oven would not only cook
the food but it would tie a bib around your neck.
</P>
<P>
   But while the increase in performance is impressive, there are
other factors at work that tend to pull down the speed with which
you can perform any given task. So, it's also my contention that
the actual speed of computing _ if you measure it by how long it
takes you to perform a given task _ hasn't changed as drastically
as you think.
</P>
<P>
   As computers have grown more powerful, applications _ everything
from word processing programs to games _ have gotten fatter and
more complex. Years ago, back when the operating system for most
PCs was DOS, I used a text-based word processor called Xywrite. It
was so compact that the entire program fit on a floppy disk. And it
was faster than the word processor I use today. Surprisingly,
perhaps, it had all the features of the high-flying word processor
I use at home now _ spell checking, multiple windows, search and
replace, almost any feature you could want. And _ as is still true
today _ the word processor contributed little to the writing
process. (There have been several times when I wished I could blame
my prose or thoughts on a word processor, but that part of the
writing equation is my problem.)
</P>
<P>
   While I can't blame bad prose on a computer, I can tell you how
to weed through all the choices available today when it comes time
to buy a computer.
</P>
<P>
   First, decide what you need to do with the computer and buy one
powerful enough to accomplish that with a little reserve power left
over. If you design graphics or work with desktop publishing in a
serious way, you really may need a state-of-the-art computer. And
if you truly just want a computer to log on to the Internet and
write an occasional letter, an el cheapo computer may be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you are relatively inexperienced and would rate
yourself low on the knowledge scale when it comes to evaluating the
various components that make up a computer _ motherboard, hard
disk, video card, sound card and RAM chips _ stick with brand-name
machines and retailers whom you already know and trust. If, on the
other hand, you are competent to make a judgment on the type of
components used, feel free to investigate the small ``screwdriver''
shops that sell no-name computers.
</P>
<P>
   Third, make sure you buy slightly more computer than you need
today. It's a certainty that your computer will be outdated soon
enough, but there's no sense helping out by buying a marginal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, if it's the Web that intrigues you, keep in mind that
the speed there is dictated by the speed of your connection, much
more than the computer. So save pennies on the computer if you
must, but pop for the fastest connection you can get if your main
use is surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my guess: If you follow my advice and shop wisely, you'll
end up spending between $1,500 and $2,000

 &HT;    First apartment experience can become a real mess
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ There are a lot of bumps along the road to
maturity. Living in an apartment for the first time is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Most young people can't afford to set up house by themselves the
first time out, so they often take on a roommate or two. This can
be a messy situation.
</P>
<P>
   Our oldest son moved into an apartment last summer with four
friends. Here are some of life's hard lessons he has learned since:
</P>
<P>
   _ Food does not regenerate in refrigerators and cabinets, and if
it does, you shouldn't eat it.
</P>
<P>
   _ Food does not cook itself and hop onto the table and lay
itself on nice place settings ready to be consumed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Food scraps left on plates, end tables, floors, beds, desks
and couches will begin to smell bad as time passes. Eventually they
will fossilize and become a permanent part of the living
environment.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dirty clothes DO regenerate and can quickly take over all your
living space.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vacuum cleaners have a purpose, and living in the hall closet
is not it.
</P>
<P>
   As a parent, I try to help my son through this transition. For
instance, I think I handled it rather well when he came home
recently and asked, ``Mom, what do you do about the black stuff in
your bathtub?''
</P>
<P>
   Speechless, I took a moment and then asked how deep it was and
if it had texture. That gave me time to figure out how to answer
him.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, this particular question didn't catch me totally
off guard. When I first visited the apartment of my future husband,
I went into his bathroom and pulled back the shower curtain to
check out his tub. Might as well know what you're getting into with
a fellow before you become emotionally involved. His white
porcelain tub was black, and our relationship came very close to
going down the drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you stand to be in that thing?'' I asked in horror.
</P>
<P>
   ``What?'' he responded, puzzled. ``Only the bottom of my feet
touch it, and I just wash them in the sink after I shower.''
</P>
<P>
   Our son obviously came by this condition honestly. Of course,
this is the same son who once asked me, ``Are the clothes in the
dryer clean?''
</P>
<P>
   No, dear, I like to fluff the dirt out of my clothes and then
wet them down. Mothers should get points for the things they manage
not to say.
</P>
<P>
   All this is a natural stage of development. I remember my first
apartment experience. My parents dropped in unexpectedly for a
visit and, having no food or clean utensils, I offered them my jar
of peanut butter and demonstrated how I often used my finger to eat
it. Much easier to clean up, you know. They took me out to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   And in all, with the wild freedom a first apartment affords,
division of labor becomes a minefield of unmet expectations. While
each roommate waits for the other to wash dishes, put away food,
vacuum, take out the trash, etc., nothing gets done. Listening to
our heretofore sloppiest son bemoan the situation, we nod
sympathetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you imagine?'' we ask in mock disgust.
</P>
<P>
   The irony escapes him.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit home for dinner, he finished eating, thanked
me profusely for a wonderful meal, took his plate to the sink,
rinsed it and put it in the dishwasher. Stunned, we then heard him
instruct his younger brothers, ``Get back in here and clean up your
dishes, you slobs!''
</P>
<P>
   We thought we had died and gone to heaven.
</P>
<P>
   We expected our son would get an education at college. The fact
that he's actually growing up, as well, is a wonderful bonus.

 &HT;    Portable MP3 players take over for the computer
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A hot trend in music is to download music
purchases directly over the Internet for storage and play through
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that is you probably don't want to lug your
personal computer to the beach, on the bus or to most of the other
places you want to go. That's why several companies are now
marketing small, portable players capable of playing music recorded
in the Internet's MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   The latest portable MP3 player is the I-Jam, introduced by the
I-Jam Multimedia Corp. of Illinois. The I-Jam ``portable MP3
multimedia system,'' as the player is called, plays MP3 files
downloaded from the Internet. It also has a built-in FM radio.
</P>
<P>
   I-Jam claims its portable MP3 player is the smallest on the
market at three inches high and less than two inches wide, and it
can be worn around the neck or on a belt clip. The I-Jam player is
supposed to deliver CD quality sound through its ear bud speakers.
</P>
<P>
   To use the I-Jam system, you download music through your
computer as you normally do. Once the music is in your computer,
you can load it onto a MultiMediaCard about the size of a postage
stamp. I-Jam says its player is compatible with all the digital
formats currently being used to download music from the Internet.
I-Jam systems were being offered online for $179.95 last week. To
get further details or to order the product, visit
www.ijamworld.com.
</P>
<P>
   The I-Jam system and other portable MP3 players also are
available through major electronics stores or through other online
audio equipment sellers.

 &HT;    Town won't forget the football team that keeps winning
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The Gibsonburg High School football team is
10-0 for the season. Playoffs start this week. And let me tell you,
the village is going nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Uptown, orange and black Golden Bear flags are flying from every
lamp post. Store windows proclaim ``This Is Bear Country!'' and
suddenly it's cool for kids to punch the air with a fist and yell
at no one in particular, ``We're No. 1!''
</P>
<P>
   ``GO BEARS!'' posters are everywhere. It's a regular football
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Afternoons, when it isn't pouring down rain or blowing snow,
front lawns are transformed into fields of potential glory by
little kids in shared equipment (the guy with the helmet has no
shoulder pads and vice versa), passing, kicking, and otherwise
mopping up the dirt with each other in their best imitation of an
older brother or the kid down the street who plays
</P>
<P>
   first-string quarterback on the winningest team in our town's
history.
</P>
<P>
   In the cafes, the hardware store, the barber shop _ it's all
folks are
</P>
<P>
   talking about. At the early morning impromptu meetings of the
village movers and shakers in the back room of the bakery,
political arguments have been replaced with quotes of passing
averages and touchdown runs and predictions for the coming Friday
night. We're just not used to winning football games.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, in the four-year period, '92 through '95, we were a
disaster. Players came in for a lot of good-natured razzing from
their classmates. I'd hear them in the halls at school taunting
some hulking senior about rumors of the first string being replaced
by the girls' choir. The guys handled it as well as 17-year-olds
can. Every once in a while some little wiseguy would have to be
freed from a locker where he'd been stuffed to shut up his smart
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of years we had such bad luck that I even began to
consider the
</P>
<P>
   possibility that I was a jinx, and that maybe if I stopped
walking over to the
</P>
<P>
   Friday night games the team would win. That didn't work either.
We kept on losing and I began to wonder where these boys got the
courage to put on their uniforms and show up on the football field
week after week. I wondered, but like the rest of the folks in
town, I respected them for doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Then an odd thing happened. Gibsonburg began winning ball games.
At first we were afraid to talk about it too much _ waiting for the
other shoe to drop, so to speak. But things kept getting better.
</P>
<P>
   In '97 we won 8 and lost only 2. Then in '98 we won 10 and lost
2. This year
</P>
<P>
   we made village history, finishing 10 and 0 and making it into
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a school so small that we have only 25 boys on the
football team.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's the first playoff game and it's here in town. A bunch
of us are
</P>
<P>
   getting together at Sharon's house for supper _ then we'll walk
over to the
</P>
<P>
   high school for the 7:30 kickoff. Since the bleachers are
expected to be
</P>
<P>
   filled by 6, we'll probably spread our blankets in the end zone.
Then we'll
</P>
<P>
   cross our fingers and hold our breath.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how the game turns out, something really big has
happened in our little town and for years folks'll be talking about
the year we went 10 and 0.

 &HT;    Knowing how to narrow search important for finding Web data
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ We're all searching for something. Unlike in the rest
of life, you're almost certain to find what you are searching for
on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the finding that is difficult on the Web. There your
problem is the enormous volume of references to your search topic
that are returned. Let's say that you just asked for information
about Brazil, since the family is considering a trip there.
</P>
<P>
   The information you need to make a decision on whether to go is
certainly in that long list of sites returned by your favorite
search engine. But along with that, you'll likely find dozens of
duplicated sites _ hits for pages that will tell you about Brazil
nuts and movies with Brazil in the title, and pages that have only
a one-sentence mention of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, today we'll talk about searching the Web and try to
come up with some ways to narrow your search.
</P>
<P>
   One problem you don't have is in finding a search engine. There
are the old reliables such as Yahoo (www.yahoo.com), Excite
(www.excite.com), Infoseek (www.infoseek.com), AltaVista
(www.altavista.com), and a relative newcomer, C/Net's Search.Com at
(search.cnet
</P>
<P>
   .com/). Then there are the sites that let you search using
several search engines at the same time. There's Dogpile at
(www.dogpile
</P>
<P>
   .com); there are pages such as the one at www.alpher.net.au
</P>
<P>
   /search.html that allow you to select the search engines you
want to use from a list, or the All-in-One Search Page at www
</P>
<P>
   .allonesearch.com/.
</P>
<P>
   You'll soon discover, if you are new to search engines, that
they are not all created equally. Search engines are like baseball
players; they're specialists that have different strengths and
weaknesses. Some search engines such as Yahoo are great for times
when you are using the Web to find something of general interest.
For instance, if you want to find out about a specific city, or
read the history of World War II, or learn more about Thomas
Edison, Yahoo is an excellent choice.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be times when you have a really narrow search and
the topic isn't something as common or popular as the examples
above. Let's say that you are looking for an old friend named Bill
Husted. Bill isn't famous and is unlikely to have much written
about him.
</P>
<P>
   That's when AltaVista comes in handy. Since it (unlike Yahoo)
searches the text of the Web pages it returns, even a single
reference to Husted will be enough to get a hit. You can see why
the strength of AltaVista (the ability to scan every word) would be
a real liability if you were looking for information about Germany
in World War II. A broader search would give you a hit on each page
that mentioned those words. That's too much.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of too much, some search engines search only a portion
of the Web. The problem is that there are so many sites out there,
and many of them are not indexed by the major search engines.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the problem of too muchness is what you may run into
on the multiple search engine sites. On the other hand, when you
are seeking hard-to-find information and don't mind the hassle of
getting some hits that are off-topic, the multiple search engines
(my favorite is Dogpile, mentioned above) can do a fine job.
</P>
<P>
   In the Web's early days, almost all search engines (there were
search engines used by researchers and academics that were notable
exceptions) were general purpose. Nowadays there's a trend toward
specialized search engines. Lycos, for instance, has a specialized
search engine at richmedia.lycos.com/ that will search out MP3
audio music, videos or electronic images.
</P>
<P>
   That's just an example since the Web is full of sites like that
these days. There are search engines specializing in finding
shareware (www.shareware
</P>
<P>
   .com); even for finding jokes (www.ezinecenter.com/Jokes
</P>
<P>
   andHumor/more2.html), and real estate listings (www.gts.com
</P>
<P>
   .tw/english/business/companies
</P>
<P>
   /real/).
</P>
<P>
   The secret is to first define your search and then to search for
a site that does the best job for that type of search.

 &HT;    IriScan's software, camera systems look security in the eye
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ After almost a decade of quietly testing and
tweaking its technology, IriScan Inc. is ready for the world to
look the future in the eye.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's cameras will be staring right back.
</P>
<P>
   IriScan makes software and small video cameras that can identify
a person based on a quick glimpse of his or her iris _ the eye's
colored ring surrounding the pupil.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing customers to shell out thousands of dollars for iris
scanning equipment and give up time-tested methods like
identification cards and fingerprints won't be easy, but in May,
the company's technology took a big step toward the mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Houston-based Bank United Corp. installed automated teller
machines in Houston, Dallas and Fort Worth, each equipped with
iris-recognition systems that replace the need for carrying cards
and punching in pass codes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social security numbers, bank cards and drivers licenses
aren't secure, so if someone gets that information, they can do
things in your name,'' said spokeswoman Kelly Gates of New
Jersey-based IriScan. ``The only way to protect this information
and make sure the right person is doing the right thing is to tie
that activity to something that you are.''
</P>
<P>
   IriScan started developing its technology in 1990. But the
market for eyeball IDs didn't catch up with the company until the
advent of the Internet, which both increased availability of
information and put a premium on keeping it as safe as possible,
Gates said.
</P>
<P>
   And in biometrics _ the science of linking one's identity to an
innate physical characteristic _ the more foolproof, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The iris is widely thought to be the most unique part of the
human body, with more than 260 different places in which the tissue
patterns can vary.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of two people having identical irises is a number so
miniscule it defies comprehension _ take the number 10, pencil in
77 more zeros, and that's how many people to sort through before
you'd find two people with like irises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could well be the most accurate biometric, with strong
potential as a security technique,'' said Jackie Fenn, an analyst
at GartnerGroup Inc. ``With fingerprints, you're looking at
minutiae and a few key features. But with the iris, there's tons of
unique information.''
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of using the iris for personal identification is
its immunity to both biology and outside forces. Fingerprints are
in constant contact with elements that can affect their appearance,
and voice patterns change based on anything from illness to simple
maturation. Conversely, the iris develops within an infant's first
three months and retains those characteristics for life.
</P>
<P>
   Sensar Inc., which built the ATM iris-recognition equipment
around IriScan's technology, plans to make it compact enough to be
embedded within devices such as personal computers, airport
security scanners and safe-deposit boxes. Already, a jail in
Sarasota, Fla., uses iris-recognition as a security measure.
</P>
<P>
   Using the eye itself as a security tool isn't altogether new.
Government agencies have used retina scanning for years to monitor
access to their high-security areas and information systems.
</P>
<P>
   But retina scanning never took off commercially because it
seemed too intrusive, Fenn said. It requires that a person stand
close to the unit, which shines a visible laser beam to the retina
at the back of the eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   ``That infrared light in the eye really turns people off,'' Fenn
said. ``That's a technology that won't take off even if it's
mass-marketed.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the iris-recognition systems involve capturing a
video image of the person's iris. Software divides the iris image
into smaller ringed segments, translating each into digital code
that's matched against a previously recorded and stored iris
profile. The whole process takes less than three seconds, according
to IriScan.
</P>
<P>
   But speed might not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   To win over consumers, iris scanning needs to be as simple as
possible for people to use, so IriScan began licensing its
technology in 1995 to companies that are exploring its commercial
potential.
</P>
<P>
   The ATMs in Texas, plus a handful in Europe, use
iris-recognition cameras made by New Jersey-based Sensar, formerly
part of RCA Electronics. Sensar used RCA's imaging technology to
make a camera that can interpret the iris from a greater distance
than IriScan's original model.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it does that for a price. The Sensar equipment can
accurately recognize an iris from 3 feet away even when it's
shielded by glasses or contact lenses _ all for what Fenn said is a
fairly hefty $3,000 per unit. Sensar and Diebold Inc., an
Ohio-based maker of ATMs, plan to build 10,000 machines to see
whether the technology is popular and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But it's little refinements like those that could make consumers
comfortable enough to embrace iris-recognition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to stick your finger on a glass plate,'' said
Fenn of GartnerGroup. ``If iris scanning gets that easy, where
people can use it without thinking about it, then it could really
take off. But that's a good three to five years away.''

 &HT;    The cyber-mall is waiting to help you with your holiday shopping
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Don't all those Internet pundits see how obvious it is
that lots of people will be shopping online this holiday season?
</P>
<P>
   Think about it: Even people who absolutely hate shopping are
forced to do it at Christmas. Anyone who's ever had to fight his or
her way through Toys ``R'' Us or Victoria's Secret at Christmastime
knows this all too well.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the episode of the TV show ``Friends'' in which one of
the characters, probably Joey, forgot all about Christmas and
bought everyone presents from a gas station? Somebody got
windshield wipers; someone else got an air filter.
</P>
<P>
   The point is that people get desperate during the holidays.
They'll buy almost anything from anyone as time begins to run out.
</P>
<P>
   So the idea that people will be shopping online this year is
really a no-brainer. Do you really want to spend the 12 days of
Christmas trekking through every bookstore in town to find that
fly-fishing book your husband keeps yakking about? Of course you
don't. Why not just sit down at your computer, log on to an online
bookseller, have them find the book, gift-wrap it and drop it on
your doorstep? And it comes in the nifty UPS box, so if your
beloved asks you what came in the mail, you can smile sweetly and
say ``Oh, this? It's a `Cooking with Soy' book. We really don't eat
enough tofu, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   It's foolproof _ not even the most curious member of your family
is going to try to rip open a UPS package. First of all, anyone
who's tried knows it's not really possible without power tools.
Secondly, unless you work for UPS, you don't have the equipment to
return the packages to their just-delivered state. You will be
found out, and you will be presentless.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if shopping at home is some wacky new idea that only
Web geeks and Microsoft employees can figure out. People have been
sitting comfortably catalogshopping and phoning up those cable
home-shopping channels for years. Now that most companies have at
least one computer hooked up to the Web, the end-of-the-millennium
holiday shopper can probably find his way to an online retailer and
place an order with little or no difficulty. It's hard to find a TV
show, newspaper or magazine that isn't stuffed with ads for
``Dot-com'' retailers urging you to get online.
</P>
<P>
   Online retailers say they've learned tons from last year's
surprise Christmas onslaught. More than just posting a list of
goods for sale, they finally understand that the Web offers more
opportunity for personalization and interaction than a catalog or a
retail store.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly for the novice e-shopper, retailers you know
and trust in the real world such as Nordstrom, Macy's, Neiman
Marcus, The Gap, Barnes &AMP; Noble, even speciality stores like The
Museum Co. and cosmetic companies such as Clinique and Bobbi Brown,
have all set up shop online. Each offers faithful consumers the
opportunity to bypass the crowds and do their holiday shopping by
the festive glow of their computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   Most sites offer very detailed and easy-to-read privacy
statements that you should read before you begin any online
shopping adventure. Any reputable site will promise security
measures to keep your credit card numbers safe. They'll also
promise not to give out any personal information you provide them
to any Internet con artists who ask for it.
</P>
<P>
   Converts to the wonders of online shopping will tell you that
the Web offers consumers much more besides convenience. There are
``wish lists'' users can create to help confused but
well-intentioned gift-givers pick out something you might really
enjoy. Other sites provide online ``personal shoppers.'' Type in
the person, the occasion, some information about their likes and
dislikes and a price range and you'll get several suggestions that
might fit the bill. If you find a retailer you like, you can often
select ``one click ordering option'' that will store your personal
information so you don't have to enter it over and over. It saves
time and provides extra security.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not shopping online yet, don't worry. The mall won't
be closing any time soon. But as the holidays draw closer, going
online is clearly better than last-minute shopping at the gas
station.

 &HT;    A look at games for kids
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's amazing that anything with Barney's mug on
it still exists. There was a time where the purple dinosaur
inspired rage and social backlash. Now, it's the opposite. Barney
is back in favor, in part because of cool toys like Barney's Song
Magic Bongos ($30). The Magic Bongos plays 11 songs in the voices
of five different instruments. All kids have to do is pick their
song (i.e. ``Farmer in the Dell'' among others) and an instrument,
ranging from a steel drum to a hooting organ sound, and start
bonging away. Each hit yields a note and, following that principle,
a bunch of notes/hits play a song. This toy is great for those
creative kids just starting to attain their dexterity, and is also
good for celebrities who insist on dancing around their homes
naked. (800-PLAYSKL)
</P>
<P>
   Bugs Bunny has a problem. On the way to Albuquerque he finds a
time machine. That's not the bad part. The bad part is that he
tries to use it and gets lost in time. In Infogrames' Bugs Bunny:
Lost in Time ($30, for the Playstation), that wascaly wabbit must
travel over five different eras in order to get back to the
present. Along the way, he meets up with favorites such as Elmer
Fudd, Witch Hazel, Yosemite Sam and Marvin the Martian. If nothing
else, this game teaches the kiddies that you shouldn't play with
time machines.
</P>
<P>
   Uncle Albert is a little crazy in the head (we'll just
euphemistically call him ``eccentric''), but boy is it fun to poke
around in his stuff! In Uncle Albert's Magical Album ($30, PC and
Mac), you can look through Albert's scrap book and piece together
an assortment of puzzles by flipping through pages and putting
items in the right places; if you find a key you can unlock the
rocket ship game and go on a space journey. Find the picture of the
champ and you can play in the stadium. The game, a bestseller in
France, is handily adapted to the U.S. and runs on Windows PCs and
Macs. It features many small films, eight individual games and a
host of animal friends to play with. (www.vtechsoft.com/album.html)

 &HT;    Surfing at work? Start here
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Having Internet access at work is like having a
television on your desk, only cooler. The studies show that online
prime time for the Net is the daytime.
</P>
<P>
   People are online the most while they are at work. Checking
stock quotes. Reading movie reviews. Scanning NFL injury reports to
set fantasy football lineups. Checking Internet e-mail in-boxes.
</P>
<P>
   All while they should be working.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site, www.ishouldbeworking.com, is nice and brazen about
the people's online slacking. People are on the Web when they
should be working, so if people are going to do it, the site
argues, why not do it here?
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the welcome message states, ``This Web site is dedicated
to slackers, goof-offs, procrastinators, loafers, `long-lunchers,'
and Web-addicted employees worldwide. You should probably be doing
something else right now, but as long as you're here, have some
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The site offers discussion groups, games and jokes. It also
includes a panic button on every page in the site. If your boss is
walking by, press it and immediately (or as long as it takes to
download) a business-oriented Web site appears.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes practical tools as well. One page offers links
to several online job-hunting sites. Another provides links to
alcoholic drink databases, and one offers links to travel planning
sites.
</P>
<P>
   COOKING LIGHT SITE HAS HEALTH TIPS, MORE
</P>
<P>
   We've heard all the excuses: You're too busy to eat right and
too overworked to burn off the excess from the food you shouldn't
be eating because you're too busy in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's one less excuse. The folks at Cooking Light magazine
improved their Web site, www.cookinglight.com. The only drawback to
the site is the annoying pop-up box, ``welcoming'' you to the site.
But that can easily be removed with a click.
</P>
<P>
   The new site includes:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nutritional information that lets you search recipes by fat
content or the percentage of calories, carbohydrates, sodium and
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   _ Twice as many recipes as the original site. Some 2,000 recipes
are included. Each is linked to dishes included as part of
last-minute menu ideas.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new, faster search engine to help find recipes when all you
know is one word.
</P>
<P>
   _ A feature called My Recipe Box, which lets you keep an online
collection of your favorite recipes.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Clueless Gourmet is geared toward someone who doesn't know
much about cooking but wants to make it seem like they do. The
selections come with tips to create ambience and advice on how to
select the fruits and vegetables in the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   LOCATE THAT HARD-TO-FIND RENTAL MOVIE
</P>
<P>
   So you want to rent an old Albert Brooks movie. But you live in
the Deep South, not exactly the holy land for movies written by and
starring a somewhat whiny, neurotic Californian. You have a few
options: You can drive to the video stores near your home and see
if they carry ``Lost in America.'' You can call and ask. Or you can
take advantage of a Web site designed to help you find hard-to-find
movies to rent.
</P>
<P>
   The site, www.formovies.com, has a search engine that lets you
type in the name of a movie and your ZIP code. After a few seconds,
it lists the phone number and address of video rental stores near
your house that carry the movie you want. A recent search on ``Lost
in America'' using a ZIP code in metro Atlanta turned up 12 video
stores, five of which were a short drive.
</P>
<P>
   The site includes more than 9,000 video stores and 160,000 movie
titles in its database. You can search for video cassettes, DVDs
and video games. You can search by movie title, actor, directory or
category.
</P>
<P>
   THE LATEST THINGS IN NET MUSIC
</P>
<P>
   Web listening: RCA's Lyra 2201 is an MP3 player that offers the
versatility of handling different formats. The RaveMP 2100 not only
looks cool but also adds a built-in microphone for four hours of
voice recording. The Rio 500, successor to the original MP3 player,
greatly improves on capacity and features.

 &HT;    Health Web site alliance agrees on timetable
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The coalition of leaders of top Internet health
sites assembled by former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said this
week it had taken its first steps to address the lack of ethical
standards in the new industry and made plans for regular
discussions over the next five months.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of 16 companies, including WebMD Inc., Healtheon
Corp., Medscape Inc., America Online Inc. and Austin's drkoop.com
Inc., met this week and formed working groups that will create
policies for advertising, privacy and content. The small groups
will meet weekly and the entire coalition _ dubbed the Hi-Ethics
Alliance _ will meet once a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started to discuss the issues, but we didn't come up with
anything,'' said Donald Kemper, chief executive of Healthwise Inc.,
an Idaho nonprofit group that runs a health site. ``It's too early
to say what things will be.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders expect to release a set of ethical principles by the end
of March, Kemper said.
</P>
<P>
   Health sites around the country have taken heat in medical
circles for creating potential conflicts of interest, providing
inaccurate information and offering diagnoses and prescribing drugs
online.
</P>
<P>
   Koop, chairman of drkoop.com, called the company leaders
together last month, but he won't play an active role in the group
despite having drawn some of the harshest criticism for perceived
ethical lapses.
</P>
<P>
   Drkoop.com, the most popular health site on the Internet, has
been judged as one of the most reliable, too.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, leaders of the American Medical Association
criticized Koop for not providing enough information about
sponsorship and commerce arrangements on the site, which derives
much of its revenue from advertising. Koop, who developed a
reputation as a tough public health advocate, was criticized last
week for telling Congress in March that medical latex gloves were
safe without disclosing that he had once been a paid consultant to
a major latex glove manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Hackett, drkoop.com's chief executive, represented the
company on the alliance and was tapped to head the advertising
group, which has already agreed that health sites should not accept
advertising from tobacco, alcoholic beverage or firearms companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals there are to ensure that we have very high standards
and principles regarding the separation between church and state,
between content and advertising,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   While it is unclear what impact the guidelines will have on the
estimated 15,000 health sites on the Internet, Kemper said he
believes they all could stand to raise their standards and solidify
their policies on ethics and credibility. For example, he would
like to see content on Healthwise.com include more detail on the
source of the information, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a shame that we didn't do this earlier so
people had clear guidelines as to what was appropriate and what was
not,'' Kemper said. ``Everybody's been working kind of blind as to
what standard operating procedure should be.''

 &HT;    Let your own needs, not price, rule your computer selection
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The newspapers are full of ads for computers that seem
to be priced impossibly low. I've seen new computers for $400 or
so, and prices around the $600 mark are common. Even fairly
powerful PCs are advertised right at the $1,000 mark.
</P>
<P>
   With rare exceptions, however, and despite what you probably
think, the price for a computer hasn't really changed much over the
years. Now, before you start calling my boss demanding that I be
given a drug and sanity test, let me explain my theory on buying
computers.
</P>
<P>
   It makes the most sense to me to buy a PC that is nearly at the
top of the pecking order when it comes to power and memory. You
tend to pay too much of a premium for the very fastest,
state-of-the-art computer. And computers at the other end of the
spectrum get outdated too quickly and also are unable to run all
the applications and games that you might choose.
</P>
<P>
   If you price this computer _ the one that is just one step below
the hottest machine out there _ my guess is that you'll pay
somewhere between $1,500 and $2,000 if you get it and an excellent
monitor. That's the same price range that you'd have found five
years ago, or even 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now the computer itself will be much more powerful than what you
would have gotten for the same amount of money even four months
ago. But that's always been true, too. If microwave ovens improved
in performance as fast as computers, your oven would not only cook
the food but it would tie a bib around your neck.
</P>
<P>
   But while the increase in performance is impressive, there are
other factors at work that tend to pull down the speed with which
you can perform any given task. So, it's also my contention that
the actual speed of computing _ if you measure it by how long it
takes you to perform a given task _ hasn't changed as drastically
as you think.
</P>
<P>
   As computers have grown more powerful, applications _ everything
from word processing programs to games _ have gotten fatter and
more complex. Years ago, back when the operating system for most
PCs was DOS, I used a text-based word processor called Xywrite. It
was so compact that the entire program fit on a floppy disk. And it
was faster than the word processor I use today. Surprisingly,
perhaps, it had all the features of the high-flying word processor
I use at home now _ spell checking, multiple windows, search and
replace, almost any feature you could want. And _ as is still true
today _ the word processor contributed little to the writing
process. (There have been several times when I wished I could blame
my prose or thoughts on a word processor, but that part of the
writing equation is my problem.)
</P>
<P>
   While I can't blame bad prose on a computer, I can tell you how
to weed through all the choices available today when it comes time
to buy a computer.
</P>
<P>
   First, decide what you need to do with the computer and buy one
powerful enough to accomplish that with a little reserve power left
over. If you design graphics or work with desktop publishing in a
serious way, you really may need a state-of-the-art computer. And
if you truly just want a computer to log on to the Internet and
write an occasional letter, an el cheapo computer may be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you are relatively inexperienced and would rate
yourself low on the knowledge scale when it comes to evaluating the
various components that make up a computer _ motherboard, hard
disk, video card, sound card and RAM chips _ stick with brand-name
machines and retailers whom you already know and trust. If, on the
other hand, you are competent to make a judgment on the type of
components used, feel free to investigate the small ``screwdriver''
shops that sell no-name computers.
</P>
<P>
   Third, make sure you buy slightly more computer than you need
today. It's a certainty that your computer will be outdated soon
enough, but there's no sense helping out by buying a marginal
computer.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, if it's the Web that intrigues you, keep in mind that
the speed there is dictated by the speed of your connection, much
more than the computer. So save pennies on the computer if you
must, but pop for the fastest connection you can get if your main
use is surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Here's my guess: If you follow my advice and shop wisely, you'll
end up spending between $1,500 and $2,000

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: My daughter dropped a musical snow dome that
was her grandmother's. Is there anyone who can repair this? If
there is no way to replace the snow and the liquid, can just the
glass dome be replaced? I would like to have it for her by
Christmas. _ Kay B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Call Unicorn Studios at (800) 874-5317 and pick up a new dome
along with snow and drifting bits _ from standard white to black
flying bats. This catalog also carries musical movements, miniature
strings of lights (for doll houses) and stuffed toy parts (eyes,
joints, noses) and stoppers (plastic or rubber). You can repair the
damage yourself. Q: I am taking my nephew (12 years old) to New
York City this month so that he can be introduced to the ``Big
Apple Experience.'' I would love to visit the Soup Nazi shop made
famous on ``Seinfeld,'' so I am hoping that you can share info
about how to find it and how to be successful in ordering our soup.
_ Kim D. Brown
</P>
<P>
   A: Be nice. Be very, very nice. Follow the rules. (No comments,
no asides, no kidding _ or no soup.) Soup Kitchen International,
259 W. 55th St. Call (212) 757-7730 first, since the kitchen closes
for extended vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Regale your nephew with the origin of the Big Apple nickname.
Its likely origin was in a Harlem club in the 1920s named the Big
Apple. Musicians often referred to a gig as an ``apple,'' and no
gig was as prestigious as playing New York City _ hence playing the
``big apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I put a savings account in my name and a relative's name,
can Medicare and the government take this money and use it to pay
for my expenses in a nursing home? I am trying to look down the
road. I am 40 and would like to have my name and my children's
names on certificates of deposit, bank accounts, the house deed,
etc. But I do not know what the rules are. I do not want my
children to be taxed on the interest. I will pay the taxes. _ D.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are planning ahead. Preparation for incapacity is a
difficult but necessary task. Making your wishes clear will make
decisions on your behalf easier for your family to make. Christine
Larson, an attorney who specializes in elder law, says a
streamlined way to handle your financial affairs is to keep
everything in your name (you pay the taxes, etc.) and to execute a
power of attorney to a trusted family member. In addition, seek the
advice of an attorney to execute a will. Q: We've recently heard
there are 6 billion people on the planet. If we put each person on
the face of the Earth in a 1-foot square, how much space would they
take up (and please don't just tell me 6 billon square feet!)?
Would they fill up Texas, the city limits of Los Angeles? How much
space would all of the people of the United States take up if put
in 1-foot squares? Just curious.
</P>
<P>
   _ Randy Case
</P>
<P>
   A: CAUTION: Word person doing math! Converting square miles into
square feet (5,280 x 5,280) gets the number of square feet in a
square mile _ 27,878,400. In your scenario, each square foot is a
person. Dividing 6 billion by the square feet in a mile yields
215.22, the number of square miles needed to stand the world's
population on 1-foot squares. Most would need more room, I think.
Where to put them? No problem. Theoretically, if everyone sticks to
the 1 square foot allotted, the entire crowd would fit into Travis
County _ with or without water, since Travis County is 1,022.1
square miles (land and water), 989.4 square mile of land, or in the
city of Austin (252.1 square miles). Yikes! More interesting is the
observation of Sigrid Clift, University of Texas Bureau of Economic
Geology geologist. If you spread the world's population over Texas
(267,277 square miles), each person would have 1,250 square feet _
one person every 35 feet (front, back and side of another person)
across the state. Some walking on water, no doubt. The population
of the United States (271,645,000) needs only 9.7 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I moved from Austin to Michigan and, boy, do I miss your
column. Can you help me with a customer satisfaction issue _ a
fiasco involving the Ryder truck used to move our stuff to
Michigan? Could you find out the president and CEO of the
responsible business? Ryder has been bought out and I have had a
hard time finding out who is on top. _ Pamela P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ryder has been purchased by Budget group, whose chairman and
CEO is Sanford Miller, 125 Basin St., Suite 210, Daytona Beach, FL
32114. Ryder customer service issues are handled by Jan Richardson,
1560 Broadway, Suite 1800, Denver, CO. 80202.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My adorable 16-month-old niece recently devalued an antique
mahogany desk. She scribbled on two drawer fronts with a Sharpie
permanent marker. Please tell me I have an option other than having
the entire desk refinished. The Sharpie is black and the stain,
dark brown. I hope some type of blending process might decrease the
intensity. How about a black and brown shoe polish?
</P>
<P>
   _ Aunt Tracy N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oops. Put the shoe polish back in the closet. Furniture
repair master Jim Neuberger says you may be able to remove the
black marks yourself. Dampen a clean rag with denatured alcohol and
quickly rub the marks. Wipe with a clean dry cloth and coat with
lemon oil. This should remove your Picasso's artwork. Not satisfied
with the results? You may be able to refinish the drawers without
refinishing the entire desk. Q: A calendar is being put together by
Sun City Georgetown called ``Aged Beef.'' It features active senior
men who, by the way, look great for their age! I would love to
purchase some of these calendars as Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Andrea Garduno
</P>
<P>
   A: Ideal for that senior lady on your holiday list. You can
order copies by calling (512) 864-1200, the Sun City Community
Association or online at aged-beef.com. The calendars (13 vigorous
men between the ages of 57 and 70) include retired Dallas Cowboy
Bob Lilly. Calendars are $9.95 plus tax and shipping. Proceeds go
to the National World War II Memorial Fund in Washington, D.C., and
the Georgetown Fire Department. The perfect gift for those who need
reminding that age is a state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About a year ago I co-signed a car loan for my son. He has
fallen behind on the payments, so I am now receiving letters and
phone calls to make the payments. Since co-signing, my finances
have decreased quite a bit and I do not see how I can make the
payments. Is there any way I can legally have my name removed, or
can I be forced to make these payments?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, B.B., but in this case the creditor holds all the
cards, says Lonnie Williams, director of Consumer Credit Counseling
Service. You were asked to co-sign because the lender did not feel
your son could fulfill this obligation. CCCS discourages co-signing
unless you are willing and able to pay the entire debt.
</P>
<P>
   You should be concerned about protecting your credit. A lender
may offer an extension in extreme cases (loss of job, illness).
However, once the account is in arrears, extensions are rare.
</P>
<P>
   UPDATE/UPSHOT/UPROAR:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upshot/Update/Uproar: Hoping to piece together a unique
holiday gift for the runner or teen in your life? Consider making a
quilt out of that pile of oh-so-special T-shirts. Only basic sewing
skills are needed. Send $9.95 to T-Quilts, 14 Sunrise Point Court,
Lake Wylie, S.C. 29710 or order a kit online at www.tquilts.com.

 &HT;    Internet2 steers toward innovation
 &HT;    By Heather Cocks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Last month, almost 30 years to the day after
Stanford University first logged onto a revolutionary 50
kilobits-per-second computer network, a new generation of Stanford
researchers sent video clips across a connection that was 48,000
times faster.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford zapped a continuous 40-minute feed of high-definition
television footage to a wall-sized screen in Seattle, where a rapt
crowd of 800 university and corporate Internet experts watched a
crystal-clear, real-time broadcast unfettered by Internet traffic
jams.
</P>
<P>
   Except that the broadcast didn't come across the Internet as we
know it.
</P>
<P>
   This clip zoomed across a superfast private network built for
the so-called Internet2 project, for which a group of universities
and technology companies are developing programs for the next wave
of bigger, better, faster Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If AM radio is today's Internet, then the technologies and
applications Internet2 is focused on are like high-definition color
TV with stereo surround-sound,'' said Greg Wood of the nonprofit
University Corporation of Advanced Internet Development, an
umbrella group coordinating Internet2 members. ``It's not just
better or really good. It's a completely different means of
communicating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Oct. 12 meeting of the Internet2 minds underscored the
project's emphasis on multimedia, viewed as the most fertile ground
for growing today's commercial Internet into tomorrow's powerful
and highly interactive entertainment, social and educational
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The HDTV movie broadcast in Seattle was one of several
demonstrations showing just how fast the online future could be.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd watched a band of Native American dancers in Alaska
perform on a live high-definition broadcast. Later, a virtuoso in
Washington gave personalized instructions to a music student in
Oklahoma. In the finale, a dancer, a musician, a poet and an
artist, sitting in four corners of the country, created and
choreographed a production featuring performers in Ann Arbor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visual elements were all finely articulated, and it was
all live over the Internet,'' said Martha Russell, who as assistant
dean of the College of Communication at the University of Texas at
Austin attended the Seattle summit. ``We're creating new technical
and social frontiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet2 began in 1996, when 34 universities sought National
Science Foundation grants to connect to a very high-speed backbone
network created by the government agency and MCI Communications
Corp., now MCI WorldCom Inc. The Internet's explosive commercial
growth made it impossible to test advanced applications, the
schools argued, because too many users and information transfers
kept clogging the pipes.
</P>
<P>
   The group proposed a private network linking only member
institutions, guaranteeing easy access and maximum network speeds,
and also letting researchers test technologies without disrupting
the widely used commercial Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the tech business, it's a 'Field of Dreams' issue,'' said
Bill Bard, who helped UT connect to the Internet in 1972 and who is
now director of Academic Computing and Instructional Technology
Services at UT. ``We figure if we build one of these things, people
and applications will come.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation agreed, offering two-year,
$350,000 grants to entice other institutions to join the new
consortium.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Internet2 membership swelled to 163 universities _ 10
in Texas, including UT _ and 60 corporate sponsors, all donating
time, money and manpower in exchange for an all-access pass to a
limitless technological playground. Cisco Systems Inc., one of the
biggest contributors, has donated about $15 million to date in
routers, switches and software that help handle network traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest Communications Inc. is helping solidify the foundation. In
March, the Denver-based company switched on a $500 million
high-speed backbone that will be the main coast-to-coast network
available to Internet2 universities.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest's Abilene Network, named for the Kansas city at its
midpoint, is capable of moving 2.4 gigabits of data per second _
the fastest speed available today. Qwest donated Abilene to
Internet2 for five years. ``Internet2 is rapidly becoming a
catalyst for application development and progress with the
Internet,'' said Guy Cook, Qwest's vice-president of Internet
services. ``This gives us a unique, direct window on all the
emerging intellectual capital and research-and-development
activities happening in this realm.''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a push for richer, more in-depth Web content,
researchers have used their high-bandwidth test-bed to toy with
three-dimensional graphics and imaging technology. From there, the
possibilities broaden to everything from collaborative surgery to
virtual-reality rooms evocative of science fiction novels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're turning up the social volume, dealing with more
computer-mediated environments,'' Russell said. ``With the speed
and the capabilities technology will bring, the only limiting
factor may be human cognitive bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   STARTING GATE
</P>
<P>
   If the origins of Internet2 and its network sound familiar, it's
because a similar scenario played out three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, the federally funded Advanced Research Projects Agency
created its namesake ARPAnet to test whether computers could
exchange information across a network. The 50 kilobit-per-second
ARPAnet linked four U.S. universities: Stanford, the University of
California at Los Angeles, the University of California at Santa
Barbara and the University of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ARPAnet spawned a series of coast-to-coast networks that
connected educational institutions and which later merged into the
present-day Internet. The ARPAnet spawned technological inventions
like e-mail in 1972 and the World Wide Web in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's Internet is successful because it went through that
large-scale testing,'' Wood said. ``It proved these technologies
could be widely deployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Envisioning potential profits, companies quickly came knocking.
In 1991, the National Science Foundation agreed to allow commercial
use of its network.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, it left universities and other researchers without
a test network to call their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It posed the question, 'What happens to all the research we're
doing?''' Bard said. ``A lot of institutions still wanted to keep
up with the hunt for the next Killer App.''
</P>
<P>
   From similar thinking at universities around the country,
Internet2 was born.
</P>
<P>
   Today, for a minimum investment of $500,000 per year, member
universities connect to either the MCI network owned by the
National Science Foundation or the recently donated Qwest backbone.
</P>
<P>
   A juiced-up clone of its research-oriented predecessor, the fast
Internet2 network gives companies and universities the freedom to
test high-tech innovations such as Web-conferenced college classes
without sweating the logistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to keep it separate because commercial service
providers aren't interested in experimenting with new technology
that could cause hiccups in the system,'' said Michael Turzanski of
Cisco Systems Inc.'s Advanced Internet Initiatives department.
``This way, if it breaks down, it's not as much a crisis as if
America Online breaks down _ and if it breaks, it gives us
something to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite origins that closely mirror today's Internet, insiders
say the apparent cyber-circle of life probably won't repeat itself.
With the commercial Internet thriving and maturing at its own pace
_ the pace of its users _ the Internet2 networks can likely stay
private and a few gigabits ahead of the mainstream Internet without
ever actually supplanting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years from now, there will be a whole new set of
challenges for us to focus on,'' Wood said. ``The point of
Internet2 is to commercialize our technologies, but not the network
itself so we can still use it to meet those challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   PIPE DREAMS
</P>
<P>
   But for the average user, Internet2 technologies are pipe dreams
until current Internet technology gets up to speed.
</P>
<P>
   Some phone companies and service providers are taking big steps
toward beefing up available bandwidth. SBC Communications Corp. is
planning to spend $6 billion to upgrade its Asymmetrical Direct
Subscriber Lines, or ADSL, so that 80 percent of its customers can
get those always-on Internet connections. Offered at either 1.5 or
7 megabits-per-second, ADSL connections are competitive with Time
Warner Inc.'s cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   But traffic still poses problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Abilene Network guarantees end-to-end performance, meaning
downloads are fast and uninterrupted regardless of how many users
log on at a given time. In the real Internet world, there are no
such promises.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Internet2 point out that technology developed on a
high-speed private network with limited users might not transfer
well onto the commercial Internet _ even if it gets bigger and
faster and better in the future. That's because the commercial
Internet as we know it isn't limited to just 163 schools, but to
millions of users worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   So at least for now, some of the sexier Internet2 applications
might have to wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cable and DSL are raising the bar, but that's not enough,''
said Turzanski of Cisco. ``The reality is that yes, we're going to
need a whole lot more bandwidth, and it's got to be more
intelligent bandwidth.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is studying a solution involving smarter management of
network traffic, whereby anyone making high demands on the network
_ like downloading the HDTV clip _ could get extra bandwidth for a
set amount of time, borrowing from users simply surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Oregon used the recent Net Aid concert to test
another technique for cutting traffic. Currently, servers respond
to requests for streaming video by sending one stream to each user
across the national network, creating huge traffic jams like the
one that last year stalled a live Victoria's Secret online fashion
show.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Oregon Internet2 team multicast Net Aid footage. It
sent one copy across the national network, and routers at each
member school knew to capture and copy the feed based on the number
of local users who wanted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who wanted a copy got one,'' he said. ``We could do
it over Abilene, but we can't do it with regular Net Aid servers
because all the networks in between aren't enabled. It would have
crashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brave new world
</P>
<P>
   When broadband connections catch on, the first Internet2
technology that becomes available will likely be multimedia
megaprograms that create interactive social situations from
Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   That could carry with it a new set of interpersonal challenges,
as future generations inherit a medium that can build relationships
by giving voices and real-time conversations to e-mail pen-pals,
according to Russell of the UT College of Communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a phenomenal opportunity for work groups to
collaborate across space and time,'' Russell said. ``But people are
hard-wired to communicate with other people, so the software and
hardware has to make things conducive to the trust and
understanding people need for collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell cited interactive distance-learning as one of the most
practical applications of high-bandwidth real-time Web conferencing
tested at the Seattle Internet2 member meeting. She also pointed to
social and political issues surrounding the definition of what's
public and what's private on an Internet that's no longer faceless
or anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   It could also introduce distance-based living, Russell said. For
families in which one or both parents travel frequently,
Web-enabled face-to-face interactions could shape the ways children
develop and maintain bonds with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers went a step further, theorizing that bandwidth
might one day transmit smell, touch, even taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be so cool to get on the Internet and have the scent
of a pepperoni pizza delivered, or feel a brand-new leather
jacket,'' said Wood of the Internet2 research group. ``We can't
digitize that stuff now, but in the future, who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at some of the advanced, real-time applications
that researchers hope will be part of the Internet's future:
</P>
<P>
   _ Long-distance surgery. Specialists could watch and consult on
an operation across the Internet, advising the surgeons about
specific problems and reducing the need for on-site specialists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Real-time collaboration. Engineers and designers, working in
different cities, could tweak blueprints for things such as planes,
vehicles or even buildings. Scientists could watch each other's
experiments and share data, and doctors could transmit X-rays or
charts to each other for second and third opinions.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teleimmersion. A person would walk into a small room right out
of `Star Trek,' don 3-D virtual reality goggles and communicate
with someone in the same type of room on the other side of the
world. This technology, on the high-end of Internet2 research, also
incorporates the sense of touch.

 &HT;    Portable MP3 players take over for the computer
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A hot trend in music is to download music
purchases directly over the Internet for storage and play through
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with that is you probably don't want to lug your
personal computer to the beach, on the bus or to most of the other
places you want to go. That's why several companies are now
marketing small, portable players capable of playing music recorded
in the Internet's MP3 format.
</P>
<P>
   The latest portable MP3 player is the I-Jam, introduced by the
I-Jam Multimedia Corp. of Illinois. The I-Jam ``portable MP3
multimedia system,'' as the player is called, plays MP3 files
downloaded from the Internet. It also has a built-in FM radio.
</P>
<P>
   I-Jam claims its portable MP3 player is the smallest on the
market at three inches high and less than two inches wide, and it
can be worn around the neck or on a belt clip. The I-Jam player is
supposed to deliver CD quality sound through its ear bud speakers.
</P>
<P>
   To use the I-Jam system, you download music through your
computer as you normally do. Once the music is in your computer,

 &HT;    Pearls of wisdom offered for senior citizens
 &HT;    By Hap LeCrone
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Here's a roundup of wisdom for senior citizens:
</P>
<P>
   _ I started with nothing. I still have most of it.
</P>
<P>
   _ When did my wild oats turn to prunes and all bran?
</P>
<P>
   _ I finally got my head together, now my body is falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   _ Funny, I don't remember being absent minded.
</P>
<P>
   _ All reports are in. Life is now officially unfair.
</P>
<P>
   _ If all is not lost, where is it?
</P>
<P>
   _ It is easier to get older than it is to get wiser.
</P>
<P>
   _ If at first you do succeed, try not to look astonished.
</P>
<P>
   _ The first rule of holes: if you are in one, stop digging.
</P>
<P>
   _ I tried to get a life once, but they told me they were out of
stock.
</P>
<P>
   _ I went to school to become a wit, only got halfway through.
</P>
<P>
   _ It was so different before everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nostalgia isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   _ Old programmers never die. They just terminate and stay
resident.
</P>
<P>
   _ A day without sunshine is like a day in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   _ I wish the buck stopped here! I could use a few.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's not the pace of life that concerns me, it's the sudden
stop at the end.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's hard to make a comeback when you haven't been anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   _ Living on Earth is expensive, but it does include a trip
around the sun.
</P>
<P>
   _ The only time the world beats a path to your door is if you're
in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   _ If God wanted me to touch my toes, he would have put them on
my knees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Never knock on death's door, ring the bell and run (he hates
that).
</P>
<P>
   _ Lead me not into temptation (I can find the way myself).
</P>
<P>
   _ When you are finally holding all the cards, why does everyone
else decide to play chess?
</P>
<P>
   _ If you are living on the edge, make sure you're wearing your
seat belt.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are two kinds of pedestrians: the quick and the dead.
</P>
<P>
   _ An unbreakable toy is useful for breaking other toys.
</P>
<P>
   _ A closed mouth gathers no feet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health is merely the slowest possible rate at which one can
die.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's hard to meet expenses; they are everywhere.

 &HT;    Everybody has questions or answers on reformatting
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I was on vacation when I engaged in the Herculean
struggles with my hard drive described in the past two reports, so
all the messages pointing out my blunder didn't reach me.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is good to be able to say that on the second
go-round, I did discover that it was unnecessary to install Windows
95 before installing 98.
</P>
<P>
   Some readers, however, had questions rather than advice, and
I'll try to answer some of them here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you reformat the hard drive by upgrading your BIOS with a
more current version known as BIOS flashing? Also, I'm going to buy
an Uninstall program from Norton that helps me find many of those
programs and files that get lost and need to be deleted to increase
hard drive space and performance.
</P>
<P>
   A: Formatting the hard drive has nothing to do with a BIOS
upgrade. Formatting the hard drive is accomplished using the FORMAT
command and simply wipes the drive clean, sort of like taking an
eraser to a blackboard.
</P>
<P>
   The program to which you refer is Norton's CleanSweep. Let me
suggest that you buy SystemWorks, which includes CleanSweep and a
lot more good stuff, too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the command used to format the hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   A: The way I do it is to go to the DOS prompt and enter the
command ``format,'' followed by the drive designation, i.e.:
``format c:''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I also own a Compaq 7212 and made the set of system disks.
Will these 30 disks be all that I need to load Windows 95 on my new
computer?
</P>
<P>
   A: I couldn't say without seeing what's on the disks, but I
would suggest staying entirely legal and much more modern by going
to Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will formatting the hard drive cause me to lose DOS?
</P>
<P>
   A: You bet.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about CMOS settings, etc.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't worry about them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You wrote that you backed up your hard disk ``by a direct
connection via parallel port.'' How did you do this?
</P>
<P>
   A: In the communications section of the Windows 98 accessories,
there is a provision for setting up a direct cable connection to
another computer. I seem to remember it was available in 95, too,
but I'm not sure. If not, there are plenty of programs, such as
LapLink, that will do it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Exactly what are ``registry files,'' and how can I find a
program that will copy and store them? Do you have one registry
file for your hard drive, or do you have one for each program on
the hard drive?
</P>
<P>
   A: There is only one registry file, which contains critical
information about each program on the drive, and it basically
replaces the old WIN.INI file of Windows 3.x. Don't bother looking
for it with Explorer because it's invisible. Don't mess with it,
either. Norton SystemWorks not only contains a program for storing
copies of the Registry but one that will detect and correct simple
problems in it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In your opinion, when performing a backup of the hard drive,
is it best to back up the entire drive, including program files, or
just the data files?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can reinstall the program files, but remember that you
want to save things like your browser bookmarks and your e-mail
address book. Otherwise you really need only back up your data
files.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I use the drag and drop technique to move some programs
from C: to D:, will they actually be physically moved so that they
will not be deleted on reformatting C:?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there a way to verify the serial number of the Windows OS
I've loaded so I can ensure to use the proper CD for
reinstallation?
</P>
<P>
   A: What, you've got a collection of them? I can find no way to
figure out which one is installed, and I suspect that's the way
Microsoft wanted it.

 &HT;    Consumer Q&AMP;A
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Q: My daughter dropped a musical snow dome that
was her grandmother's. Is there anyone who can repair this? If
there is no way to replace the snow and the liquid, can just the
glass dome be replaced? I would like to have it for her by
Christmas. _ Kay B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Call Unicorn Studios at (800) 874-5317 and pick up a new dome
along with snow and drifting bits _ from standard white to black
flying bats. This catalog also carries musical movements, miniature
strings of lights (for doll houses) and stuffed toy parts (eyes,
joints, noses) and stoppers (plastic or rubber). You can repair the
damage yourself. Q: I am taking my nephew (12 years old) to New
York City this month so that he can be introduced to the ``Big
Apple Experience.'' I would love to visit the Soup Nazi shop made
famous on ``Seinfeld,'' so I am hoping that you can share info
about how to find it and how to be successful in ordering our soup.
_ Kim D. Brown
</P>
<P>
   A: Be nice. Be very, very nice. Follow the rules. (No comments,
no asides, no kidding _ or no soup.) Soup Kitchen International,
259 W. 55th St. Call (212) 757-7730 first, since the kitchen closes
for extended vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Regale your nephew with the origin of the Big Apple nickname.
Its likely origin was in a Harlem club in the 1920s named the Big
Apple. Musicians often referred to a gig as an ``apple,'' and no
gig was as prestigious as playing New York City _ hence playing the
``big apple.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I put a savings account in my name and a relative's name,
can Medicare and the government take this money and use it to pay
for my expenses in a nursing home? I am trying to look down the
road. I am 40 and would like to have my name and my children's
names on certificates of deposit, bank accounts, the house deed,
etc. But I do not know what the rules are. I do not want my
children to be taxed on the interest. I will pay the taxes. _ D.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: You are planning ahead. Preparation for incapacity is a
difficult but necessary task. Making your wishes clear will make
decisions on your behalf easier for your family to make. Christine
Larson, an attorney who specializes in elder law, says a
streamlined way to handle your financial affairs is to keep
everything in your name (you pay the taxes, etc.) and to execute a
power of attorney to a trusted family member. In addition, seek the
advice of an attorney to execute a will. Q: We've recently heard
there are 6 billion people on the planet. If we put each person on
the face of the Earth in a 1-foot square, how much space would they
take up (and please don't just tell me 6 billon square feet!)?
Would they fill up Texas, the city limits of Los Angeles? How much
space would all of the people of the United States take up if put
in 1-foot squares? Just curious.
</P>
<P>
   _ Randy Case
</P>
<P>
   A: CAUTION: Word person doing math! Converting square miles into
square feet (5,280 x 5,280) gets the number of square feet in a
square mile _ 27,878,400. In your scenario, each square foot is a
person. Dividing 6 billion by the square feet in a mile yields
215.22, the number of square miles needed to stand the world's
population on 1-foot squares. Most would need more room, I think.
Where to put them? No problem. Theoretically, if everyone sticks to
the 1 square foot allotted, the entire crowd would fit into Travis
County _ with or without water, since Travis County is 1,022.1
square miles (land and water), 989.4 square mile of land, or in the
city of Austin (252.1 square miles). Yikes! More interesting is the
observation of Sigrid Clift, University of Texas Bureau of Economic
Geology geologist. If you spread the world's population over Texas
(267,277 square miles), each person would have 1,250 square feet _
one person every 35 feet (front, back and side of another person)
across the state. Some walking on water, no doubt. The population
of the United States (271,645,000) needs only 9.7 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I moved from Austin to Michigan and, boy, do I miss your
column. Can you help me with a customer satisfaction issue _ a
fiasco involving the Ryder truck used to move our stuff to
Michigan? Could you find out the president and CEO of the
responsible business? Ryder has been bought out and I have had a
hard time finding out who is on top. _ Pamela P.
</P>
<P>
   A: Ryder has been purchased by Budget group, whose chairman and
CEO is Sanford Miller, 125 Basin St., Suite 210, Daytona Beach, FL
32114. Ryder customer service issues are handled by Jan Richardson,
1560 Broadway, Suite 1800, Denver, CO. 80202.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My adorable 16-month-old niece recently devalued an antique
mahogany desk. She scribbled on two drawer fronts with a Sharpie
permanent marker. Please tell me I have an option other than having
the entire desk refinished. The Sharpie is black and the stain,
dark brown. I hope some type of blending process might decrease the
intensity. How about a black and brown shoe polish?
</P>
<P>
   _ Aunt Tracy N.
</P>
<P>
   A: Oops. Put the shoe polish back in the closet. Furniture
repair master Jim Neuberger says you may be able to remove the
black marks yourself. Dampen a clean rag with denatured alcohol and
quickly rub the marks. Wipe with a clean dry cloth and coat with
lemon oil. This should remove your Picasso's artwork. Not satisfied
with the results? You may be able to refinish the drawers without
refinishing the entire desk. Q: A calendar is being put together by
Sun City Georgetown called ``Aged Beef.'' It features active senior
men who, by the way, look great for their age! I would love to
purchase some of these calendars as Christmas gifts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Andrea Garduno
</P>
<P>
   A: Ideal for that senior lady on your holiday list. You can
order copies by calling (512) 864-1200, the Sun City Community
Association or online at aged-beef.com. The calendars (13 vigorous
men between the ages of 57 and 70) include retired Dallas Cowboy
Bob Lilly. Calendars are $9.95 plus tax and shipping. Proceeds go
to the National World War II Memorial Fund in Washington, D.C., and
the Georgetown Fire Department. The perfect gift for those who need
reminding that age is a state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Q: About a year ago I co-signed a car loan for my son. He has
fallen behind on the payments, so I am now receiving letters and
phone calls to make the payments. Since co-signing, my finances
have decreased quite a bit and I do not see how I can make the
payments. Is there any way I can legally have my name removed, or
can I be forced to make these payments?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.B.
</P>
<P>
   A: Sorry, B.B., but in this case the creditor holds all the
cards, says Lonnie Williams, director of Consumer Credit Counseling
Service. You were asked to co-sign because the lender did not feel
your son could fulfill this obligation. CCCS discourages co-signing
unless you are willing and able to pay the entire debt.
</P>
<P>
   You should be concerned about protecting your credit. A lender
may offer an extension in extreme cases (loss of job, illness).
However, once the account is in arrears, extensions are rare.
</P>
<P>
   UPDATE/UPSHOT/UPROAR:
</P>
<P>
   _ Upshot/Update/Uproar: Hoping to piece together a unique
holiday gift for the runner or teen in your life? Consider making a
quilt out of that pile of oh-so-special T-shirts. Only basic sewing
skills are needed. Send $9.95 to T-Quilts, 14 Sunrise Point Court,
Lake Wylie, S.C. 29710 or order a kit online at www.tquilts.com.

 &HT;    Networks' youth movement got old in a hurry
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ And now a moment of silence _ or wild-eyed
cheering, depending on your point of view _ for the dearly
departed.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies traditionally begin piling up in late October and
early November, when the networks suddenly realize that an
embarrassing number of shows they touted so loudly in September are
fading fast in the Nielsens. Nobody's watching, and therefore
advertisers aren't buying. Pretty soon, cancellations happen.
</P>
<P>
   Cancellations, unlike development deals and premieres, are never
announced. They just happen. Thinly veiled terms like ``going on
hiatus'' are often used when replacements arrive. Asked if a series
was about to be canceled, a network president once told me, ``We
don't cancel series. We just don't renew them.'' Sometimes they
don't even finish out half the season before they're ``not
renewed.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC's lame sitcom ``The Mike O'Malley Show,'' rewritten twice in
its pilot stage (never a good sign), was the first to go _ after
two episodes. And the Peacock's ditzy 20-something relationship
dramedy ``Cold Feet'' turned toes up last week. CBS wasted no time
in axing ``Work With Me,'' a lackluster romantic comedy, after a
couple of weeks. Fox's teen sex sudser ``Manchester Prep,'' loosely
based on the movie ``Cruel Intentions,'' was canceled before it
premiered.
</P>
<P>
   Once the hottest and fastest-growing network, Fox is the sickest
this fall, down almost 20 percent in total viewership. ``Action,''
the most-hyped sitcom in recent memory (thanks to its bleeped-out
language), apparently has been bleeped from the consciousness of
millions of viewers. After the show finished in the Nielsen bottom
20, Fox yanked it from the schedule for the November sweeps with a
faint promise to return in December _ the month when absolutely
nobody watches television. Good plan.
</P>
<P>
   Fox also yanked the badge from its teen cop drama ``Ryan
Caulfield'' and deleted Chris Carter's virtual reality drama,
``Harsh Realm,'' from its mainframe. Sooner or later, the
possibility that Carter is a one-hit wonder must be considered.
``The X-Files'' is remarkable television, but Carter's second
series, ``Millennium,'' was a major dud.
</P>
<P>
   Not yet dead but heading in that direction are Fox's quirky
family drama ``Get Real,'' the half-hour ``Ally'' and Jennifer Love
Hewitt's disappointing ``Time of Your Life.'' Ditto NBC's superb
high-school drama ``Freaks and Geeks.'' ABC dropped the sitcom
``Then Came You,'' which nobody missed because nobody saw it, and
has temporarily shelved Kevin Williamson's ``Wasteland,'' a truly
vast wasteland of 20-something angst. The teen sitcom ``Odd Man
Out'' and the arrested development comedy ``Oh, Grow Up'' could be
next.
</P>
<P>
   Do you see a trend here? Actually, it's an anti-trend, a
rejection of the networks' obsession with teen and 20-something
dramas and anything resembling a comedy. The success stories this
season are dramas about adults _ ``Once and Again,'' ``Judging
Amy,'' ``Family Law,'' ``The West Wing,'' ``Law &AMP; Order: Special
Victims Unit'' and ``Now and Again.''
</P>
<P>
   When the New York advertising agency BBDO made its fall
predictions in July, dramas were correctly tagged a ``hot trend.''
But the qualifying phrase ``particularly hot are dramas targeted
toward young adults and teens'' turned out to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Why? As Nielsen Media Research points out, teens and
20-somethings watch the least amount of TV of any demographic
group. A series on a major network targeted at this group would
have to appeal to a much wider audience to succeed, and this
season's offerings did not. ABC's ``Boy Meets World'' does to some
degree and ``The Wonder Years'' did to a great degree, but this
year's crop has a narrower focus.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-themed shows have a better chance of succeeding on the WB,
where lower ratings are tolerated. It's OK with WB and its
advertisers for ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' to be ranked 89th and
``Dawson's Creek'' to land at 91st, as they were last week, but NBC
needs much bigger ratings for 83rd-ranked ``Freaks and Geeks'' to
survive.
</P>
<P>
   With teens already juggling homework, extracurriculars and
yammering on the phone, maybe the networks should be content to
have them tuning into ``Friends,'' ``ER'' and ``The X-Files'' and
stop trying to carve out new shows in the teen image. If they're
already devoted to ``Buffy'' and ``Dawson,'' they probably don't
have time or appetite for more.

 &HT;    Atlanta celebrates arrival of pandas
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Zoo Atlanta's two panda cubs landed Friday morning to
a cheering crowd of about 500 people. Lun-Lun and Yang-Yang flew
from China on a 767 cargo plane called the Panda Express. The zoo's
marketing director said the pandas had no problems on the trip from
Beijing and slept most of the way.
</P>
<P>
   The animals _ each inside a gray, steel cage _ were lowered
slowly to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   The pandas will be quarantined for at least a week. The public
will be allowed to view them beginning Nov. 20.
</P>
<P>
   There are only about 1,000 pandas left in the world, with about
120 in zoos and other institutions. Two other U.S. zoos besides
Atlanta's have pandas.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists plan to study Lun-Lun and Yang-Yang to figure out how
to help them have babies in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   DO ACTION FIGURES SEND WRONG MESSAGE TO KIDS?
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart stores pulled a wrestling toy from its shelves last
week after complaints. The toy was a WWF wrestler carrying a
woman's head. it was modeled after Al Snow, a world wrestling
federation competitor who carries a female mannequin's head into
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our management has decided it is at least a questionable
item,'' said John Bisio, a store spokesman. ``So we are removing it
from the shelf, probably permanently.''
</P>
<P>
   Katherine Kinnick of Powder Springs co-authored an essay
protesting the toy in last week's Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrific to see corporations do the right thing _ and
that a couple of Cobb County moms can make a difference,'' said
Kinnick. ``My sons are 6 and 11. What kind of message would this
toy send them about brutalization of women?''
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM HIT BY FLOODS
</P>
<P>
   The Red Cross and Vietnamese government began airlifts last week
to help thousands of victims of flooding. It is the worst flooding
in Vietnam in 40 years. More than 300 people have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   With rain still falling, helicopters landed to pass out food to
stranded residents. The United Nations estimates more than 1
million people need emergency food and more than 500,000 homes have
been submerged.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A vote for Churchill as Man of the Century
 &HT;    (For release Nov. 10, 1999.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amid consternation that Adolf Hitler could be voted the most
influential creature of this waning century, I'd like to put in my
bid for the man who stamped him out: Winston Churchill. In doing
so, Churchill saved Western civilization from the Nazi hordes.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't appear that Churchill will be the ultimate leader in
Time magazine's electronic poll _ and likely will finish behind
Elvis Presley _ but that's generational stuff.
</P>
<P>
   It is much like the recent baseball team of the century, in
which relatively few who played before 1945 were voted in, while a
present-day player _ outstanding but not yet deity _ was. Most of
the voters never saw any of the players of the early part of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you had to also live the Churchill years to realize the
scope of this man's influence. Otherwise, you had to pick it up
from books such as William Manchester's two completed volumes on
him or granddaughter Celia Sandys' two volumes, both of which leave
us on the brink of World War II and the greatest Churchill years of
all.
</P>
<P>
   I've had a bit of both. I picked up Churchill where the two
biographers have left off. As a youth during World War II, I came
to realize how much he meant to England, to the United States and
to the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I had no knowledge of his earlier escapades in
South Africa, or the disaster at Gallipoli. I only knew that when
the world was threatened by Nazi Germany, he stood alone to face up
to them, and he prevailed.
</P>
<P>
   Rushed into the prime minister's role after Neville
Chamberlain's failed appeasement of Hitler, he inherited a
monstrous job. The Nazis ruled western Europe and had, in its
sights, the British Isles.
</P>
<P>
   With little and outdated equipment, with far less personnel than
the Nazis, and with an ocean separating Great Britain from the
nearest free country, the United States, Churchill went to war with
words.
</P>
<P>
   His speeches to the British people were exhilarating, so much so
that he rallied them from the gloom and horror of nightly Nazi
bombings: ``Never give in, never give in, never, never, never,
never _ in nothing, great or small, large or petty _ never give in
except to convictions of honor and good sense.''
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't inspiring his people, he was romancing a
sympathetic Franklin D. Roosevelt to be a supplier of war materiel:
``Give us the tools, and we will finish the job.''
</P>
<P>
   He rallied the outnumbered Royal Air Force, whose Spitfire
fighter planes took on a superior but not as inspired Nazi
Luftwaffe. ``Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed
to so many by so few,'' he boasted of his fliers.
</P>
<P>
   Had there not been a Winston Churchill during those dark days,
the world likely would be much different today. It would be
Hitler's world with all the depravation that would result from it.
</P>
<P>
   His influence with Roosevelt, his ability to overcome an
isolationist-bent Congress and a strong America First lobby,
propelled Churchill as the pillar of Western freedom, the man who
held the Nazis at bay until such time when the U.S. was compelled
to enter the war. Britain was saved from the Nazis before then _
and it was Churchill's doing, with help from Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that Hitler was quite influential but in a
deadly way. He was Satan on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Others were more influential in a positive way. One such person
was Dr. Jonas Salk, who discovered a vaccine to defeat polio.
Another is Billy Graham, who evangelized much of this nation
without the circus-like atmosphere that exists among other
evangelists today. And Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., who inspired a
nation to look within itself and who was an orator on a par with
Churchill.
</P>
<P>
   But they could not have been influential had not Winston
Churchill, years earlier, saved us all from the darkness that
threatened this world.
</P>
<P>
   The last I noted, Elvis still led the pack, Hitler was third and
Churchill was back in the second ten. Think about the absurdity of
that.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Pop quiz burst Bush's bubble
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pop quiz a Boston TV reporter sprang on George W. Bush was
dry-gulch journalism that created a 24-hour sensation, about twice
the shelf life it merited. That said, Bush pretty much brought the
resulting embarrassment on himself.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been ducking requests for interviews like a rabbit
trying to hightail it out of a hailstorm. The ground rules for the
interviews he does grant often limit the topics in advance.
Reporters covering the presumptive GOP presidential nominee have
taken to calling him the candidate in a bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Excessive reticence and overbearing political handling only
build up pressure for reporters to have at the candidate with
special aggression in the moments when he does turn off the bubble
machine. In particular, with a couple of his foreign-affairs gaffes
already on the record, reporters have wanted to probe _ and voters
deserve to know _ Bush's acumen on international matters.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, WHDH-TV reporter Andy Hiller pulled off more of a
stunt than a coup.
</P>
<P>
   Hiller asked Bush to name the leaders of India, Pakistan, Taiwan
and Chechnya. The candidate got just one right, President Lee
Teng-hui of Taiwan _ and him only in truncated form: ``Yeah, Lee.''
That's an F even if you're grading on a curve.
</P>
<P>
   This excited squeals of maidenly fright in foreign-policy
circles. And brought an unbecoming boast from Al Gore's camp that
their guy would have aced the test. Maybe, but the claim is
unprovable and making it marked Gore anew as the class prig, just
when he is supposed to be morphing into an alpha male.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's inability to come up on the spur of the moment with
Pervaiz Musharraf (Pakistan), Atal Bihari Vajpayee (India) and
Aslan Maskhadov (Chechnya) will rightly strike most folks as
neither surprising nor very worrisome; perhaps even as endearing.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, as the reporter noted, all four preside in especially
inflammable hot stops, but Bush is not yet manning the levers and
valves of the nation's foreign-policy machinery. By his own
admission, Bush is no more a foreign-policy wonk than Bill Clinton
was at this point in his scramble for the Democratic presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Tripping Bush as he labors up the learning curve was just cutesy
pseudo-journalism and no trick. How much better to have asked just
one question that called for knowledgeable response to a major
international issue that even an embryonic president should
command.
</P>
<P>
   With record and pre-emptive funding, Bush continues to avoid
serious challenge to the Republican nomination. There's a natural
temptation not to mess with success.
</P>
<P>
   But the longer Bush relies on set-piece speeches, personality
and daunting bank accounts, the greater the doubts about whether,
even if he is the certain nominee, this is a candidate who is ready
for presidential prime time.
</P>
<P>
   Until Bush begins to sit for thoughtful interviews that could
end those doubts, he will continue being stung by the random
zingers that manage to pop his bubble.

PIERCE BROSNAN: JAMES BOND IS NOT ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.)

 (Includes a color slide of Pierce Brosnan with Denise Richards in a
scene from ``The World Is Not Enough.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It isn't easy being James Bond.
 &HT;    Just ask Pierce Brosnan, who makes his third appearance in the
role with ``The World Is Not Enough,'' opening Nov. 19.
 &HT;    Bond may dine at lavish gourmet restaurants and sip martinis _
shaken, of course, but not stirred _ but the actor who plays him
has to watch his figure.
 &HT;    ``I lay off the red wine and the cream sauces,'' Brosnan says
with a laugh. ``It's heinous being James Bond!
 &HT;    ``Before I do the love scenes,'' he adds, ``I have to remind
myself, `Pierce, you have been seminaked on stage before. You've
been naked on film.'
 &HT;    ``Then I look in the mirror and think, `Jesus, does my stomach
look flat enough?'
 &HT;    ``I'm like any woman preparing to show her body on screen in a
love scene,'' Brosnan admits. ``I live in the gym for months before
these movies. For God's sake, I lift large weights.''
 &HT;    Over coffee on a Sunday morning, the handsome actor is dressed
in white-silk slacks, a matching shirt and two days of facial
stubble. He likes to complain about being Bond but, rumors to the
contrary, he insists that this isn't his last spin as 007.
 &HT;    ``Contractually this is my last Bond film,'' he says. ``I'm
contracted for three, with the option of a fourth. And the last
three I've gone out the door with very quickly _ I've done these
movies rapidly to establish myself as the character.
 &HT;    ``Of course, now there are other characters I want to do who are
not James Bond,'' he adds. ``So I'm not in any hurry to do the
fourth Bond.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, he admits that he'd hate to see someone else
in the role.
 &HT;    ``Look, we'll do a fourth Bond,'' he says. ``I want to do a
fourth Bond.''
 &HT;    ``The World Is Not Enough'' has a lot of excitement, action and
suspense, Brosnan reports _ and one thing more.
 &HT;    ``Great title,'' he says in all due seriousness. ``I've always
been happy with all of my Bond titles _ except `Tomorrow Never
Lies,' which ironically is how it went to the print shop. There was
a typo and someone wrote, `Tomorrow Never Dies.' And the studio
said, `Damn it, we love it!'
 &HT;    ``But `The World is Not Enough' won't change,'' he says,
``because it's James Bond's motto from the original books _ that
was actually the family motto of the entire Bond family.''
 &HT;    The film shows a newer, slightly mellower Bond, the actor says.
 &HT;    ``In the new Bond we really paid attention to character,'' he
says. ``We have a story that has a bit more maturity than the other
two. Of course, it has action _ but I couldn't do just wall-to-wall
explosions. I just can't do it, it's boring.
 &HT;    ``I wanted an emotional content,'' he says, ``so you have
something to hold onto, and then you can jump off into the fantasy
of it all.''
 &HT;    The change in Bond merely reflects the evolution of the actor
behind him, he says.
 &HT;    ``Brosnan has changed,'' the actor says. ``I've gotten a bit
more comfortable with the role, and so much of acting is about your
confidence, relaxation and your faith in yourself, because you're
constantly being judged. The last two Bond movies have done well,
so I feel very relaxed in the role.
 &HT;    ``I also put my trust in Michael Apted, a documentarian and
diverse moviemaker who really added so much as our director.''
 &HT;    The latest film features the usual curvaceous ``Bond girls'' _
this time around, Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones and Sophie
Marceau as Electra King. Robert Carlyle plays the latest villain, a
terrorist who is impervious to pain and thinks he can't die.
 &HT;    ``He dies,'' Brosnan says flatly. ``He ain't coming back.
Neither did any other Bond baddie I've been given. Good actors,
good Bond villains _ they ain't coming back. I killed them all. No
bouncing back.
 &HT;    ``I'm a lethal guy,'' he jokes, ``and don't you forget it.''
 &HT;    Brosnan's success as Bond is all the more striking in that, when
he was first offered the role in 1986, he was forced to decline due
to his obligations to his hit television show, ``Remington Steele''
(1982-1987). Timothy Dalton took the role in ``The Living
Daylights'' (1987), and it wasn't until ``Goldeneye'' (1995) that
Brosnan got his chance.
 &HT;    The success of ``Goldeneye'' and ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' (1997)
has made Brosnan a major star, but he shows little signs of
Hollywood ego.
 &HT;    ``I treat what I do like a hobby,'' he says. ``I don't let it
obsess me.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have an ego,'' he adds. ``I want to win _ I always want
to win, I always want the best. You have to strive that high. I
admit that, as soon as I step out on stage, the show is about me.
That's the way it is, whether I'm playing two lines or my name is
above the title.
 &HT;    ``Apart from that, the joy of this career is keeping it in its
place.''
 &HT;    The death of his wife, Cassie, from ovarian cancer several years
ago helped give him a sense of perspective.
 &HT;    ``Her illness was completely unexpected,'' he recalls. ``It hit
me like a shot.''
 &HT;    He pauses, his voice choked with emotion.
 &HT;    ``I guess I learned that life doesn't cooperate with a man's
plans,'' he says. ``Her illness wasn't the way we talked about it
or planned our life. But it happens, and you just have to get on
with it and make the best of it.
 &HT;    ``I learned to appreciate the time we have here,'' he concludes.
``I appreciate everything now.''
 &HT;    Brosnan has a lot to appreciate _ being a movie star was his
boyhood dream since he saw ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' (1968), one
of the first films he encountered growing up in Drogheda in County
Louth, Ireland.
 &HT;    ``That was my introduction to the movies,'' he recalls, ``and I
left that theater wanting to be Steve McQueen. But then I went to
another movie, and I wanted to be Clint Eastwood. I was a
15-year-old kid in Ireland, living through the movies.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, however, the movies isn't enough. Brosnan also has a
2-year-old son, Dylan, whose mother is the actor's longtime
girlfriend _ and, recently, fiancee _ Keely Shaye Smith.
 &HT;    Say, Pierce, when's the wedding?
 &HT;    ``Give us a break, now,'' Brosnan begs, laughing. ``Just let us
find our space here. It's a good time for us.
 &HT;    ``Relationships take patience, love and understanding,'' he
says. ``We're learning how families work, which isn't always easy
in this world _ or especially in this business.''
 &HT;    Yes, movie stars have to face the ``terrible twos,'' just like
anyone else.
 &HT;    ``A few months ago we got on the plane from Los Angeles to
Nairobi for a family holiday,'' Brosnan recalls. ``Dylan had a
total meltdown, the poor boy. Suddenly I'm not James Bond anymore _
I'm making cow noises, and if people don't like it, tough.''
 &HT;    Believe it or not, Brosnan _ who also has two sons from his
first marriage _ recently became a grandfather, courtesy of his
stepdaughter, Charlotte.
 &HT;    ``We don't say `grandfather,''' he cautions. ``We say `pappy.'
`Granddad' is just not a word I want to put on myself right now.
Please don't call me that _ I'm still young and vital.
 &HT;    ``For God's sake, I'm James Bond!''

ROCK ON: CHRIS ROCK BRINGS HIS OWN PRIVATE EDGE TO `DOGMA' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 (Includes a color slide of Chris Rock with Linda Fiorentino in a
scene from ``Dogma.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chris Rock stepped into the offices of Miramax Films with
visions of ``The Piano'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' dancing in his
head.
 &HT;    And the powers that be in the Oscar factory handed him a script
called ``Joyride.''
 &HT;    ``I go to Miramax, the home of cool movies,'' says Rock, whose
film credits include the not-that-cool ``Boomerang'' (1992),
``CB4'' (1994) and ``Lethal Weapon 4'' (1998). ``I'd just won an
Emmy. I've got two Emmys. I'm all over the place. I'm hot, hot,
hot.
 &HT;    ``So I'm `Yeah, good. I'll do some good movies.''' he recalls.
``I get there and they offer me this, a movie with a bunch of
rappers on a bus going to make a video.''
 &HT;    Rock shakes his head and rolls his eyes.
 &HT;    ``I'm like, `Oh, my God, what the f--k is this?''' he says.
``You know what's weird? They offered me more money to date than
I've been offered for anything _ it was only a week's worth of
work.''
 &HT;    But Rock didn't give up so fast on his idea of getting in on
Miramax's cutting-edge independent-film lineup.
 &HT;    ``I said, `What's Kevin Smith doing?''' he says. ``I'd just seen
`Chasing Amy' (1997), and I loved it. It spoke to me _ I'd been in
love with girls with reputations and definitely didn't handle it
right.
 &HT;    ``And Kevin happened to be doing something. They let me see the
script.''
 &HT;    The script turned out to be ``Dogma,'' the year's most
controversial film. A black comedy about religion, it pits fallen
angels Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) against a group
of unlikely heroes that includes God's messenger (Alan Rickman), a
Muse (Salma Hayek), mankind's all-too-human would-be savior (Linda
Fiorentino) and Rufus (Rock), the 13th apostle, who blames
political reasons for his exclusion from the Scriptures.
 &HT;    ``Dogma'' proved so controversial _ both in its provocative
religious ideas and its savage mocking of a corporate conglomerate
that strongly suggested the Walt Disney Company, Miramax's
corporate parent _ that the studio felt compelled to relinquish the
film after its completion. Lions Gate Films picked it up, and will
release it nationwide on Nov. 12.
 &HT;    Rock says he never even considered the possibility that
``Dogma'' might be too controversial for him.
 &HT;    ``Me?'' he asks, laughing.
 &HT;    Actually, he says during a conversation at New York's Regency
Hotel, he wouldn't mind going a lot further than writer/director
Smith does with ``Dogma.'' There are no limits at all, as far as
he's concerned.
 &HT;    ``Everything should be skewered and satirized,'' he says
matter-of-factly. ``Nothing is above jokes. You should be able to
see the funny side of everything.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to go to heaven if it ain't funny,'' he adds.
``If heaven ain't funny, it ain't heaven.''
 &HT;    Controversy comes easily to Rock. He began performing as a
stand-up comedian at age 17, he recalls, and his act consisted of
jokes about ``getting pizza and waiting for my girlfriend's period
to come.''
 &HT;    Growing up on the tough streets of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant
neighborhood, Rock remembers being regularly beaten up and
ridiculed by white schoolmates. Religion never really played a
major role in his life, he says.
 &HT;    ``There were a lot of churches,'' the 33-year-old comedian says,
``and no sign of God.''
 &HT;    Rock later put his acerbic wit to use on ``In Living Color'' and
``Saturday Night Live,'' establishing a reputation as a fearless
funnyman. More recently, he was criticized for poking too much fun
at the likes of Ricky Martin when he hosted the 1999 MTV Awards.
 &HT;    He makes no apologies.
 &HT;    ``I think I kept the show going,'' Rock says. ``That was my job.
Where is it written that the host can't be a performer, too?
 &HT;    ``As long as you don't get personal with people,'' he says,
``you can pretty much get away with it.''
 &HT;    Besides ``Dogma,'' Rock has several other projects in the works
at the moment. The first issue of The Illtop Journal, which he
describes as ``a black version of The Harvard Lampoon,'' is due out
later this month, and he's completed the Neil LaBute comedy ``Nurse
Betty,'' which casts him and Morgan Freeman as hitmen seeking to
eliminate Renee Zellweger.
 &HT;    Early next year Rock will shoot ``I Was Made To Love Her,'' a
romantic comedy that he's co-written. In the meantime, though, his
primary focus is his HBO program, ``The Chris Rock Show.''
 &HT;    ``It's the most important thing I'm doing, artistically,'' he
says. ``It's important that it exists, because it's just a
different type of show _ it's different, from the interviews to the
comedy to the music.
 &HT;    ``There are no other black talk shows or entertainment shows at
all.''
 &HT;    The show's audience includes a substantial number of white
viewers, to the surprise of many observers _ but not of Rock
himself.
 &HT;    ``Comedy always crosses over, for the most part,'' Rock says.
``When I was a kid, we didn't say Rodney Dangerfield was a funny
white guy.''
 &HT;    Rock may be a star now, but he still remembers his leaner days,
toiling as a busboy at a local Red Lobster. Some of the people he
knew during those days still work at Red Lobster, he says, a few in
management capacities.
 &HT;    ``I was a busboy because I wasn't good enough to be a waiter,''
Rock says, smiling. ``There's nothing separating me from them,
except that I write a decent joke now and then.''
 &HT;    Well, the fact that he earns millions of dollars a year and gets
to make movies with major stars may be a bit of a distinguishing
factor. But Rock still lives in Brooklyn, and remains pretty
low-key for such a high-profile guy.
 &HT;    ``Celebrity is nonsense,'' he says. ``I look at it as people are
appreciating my work. There are a lot of celebrities who ain't
going to be here next year or six months from now or three months
from now. I'm just glad people are appreciating my work ...
 &HT;    ``I live good,'' he says. ``I dropped out of school, I'm a black
guy _ I live great.''
 &HT;    Which may be why he's always happy to turn his comic invective
against celebrities who whine about the inconveniences of stardom.
 &HT;    ``They're idiots,'' he says.

TORI AMOS' ROAD TO VENUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480, or by fax at 732-390-4697.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 (Includes a color slide of singer Tori Amos.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Not so long ago, Tori Amos spoke of fairies that inspired her
songs and brought her ideas and melodies.
 &HT;    These days, however, she's hearing the clarion call of Venus.
 &HT;    Coming relatively hot on the heels of ``From the Choirgirl
Hotel'' (1998), Amos' new album, ``To Venus and Back'' (Atlantic
Records, 1999), is actually a happy accident, what was intended as
a B-side collection until it spun out of control and became a full
new set of songs _ in addition to a second disc of live recordings
from her 1998 tour.
 &HT;    ``The engineers started looking at me and said, `Theoretically,
this does not work in a B-side concept,''' says the Maryland-born
Amos, who resides in southwest England with her husband, engineer
Mark Hawley, and also produced ``To Venus and Back.'' ``I said `OK,
why?'
 &HT;    ``And they said, `It's like an ecosystem. You can't just extract
this out _ it'll feel random. It doesn't sonically have a geometric
shape.'
 &HT;    ``Now, they're engineers,'' she says with a laugh. ``They're out
of their minds. But they do understand that realm, and I began to
see it was valid what they were saying _ the B-side thing became
just so hodgepodge. It became clear it was to be a new work.''
 &HT;    Amos already had the title, too, from a conversation with
friends over a bottle of wine.
 &HT;    ``One of them said, `You'd go to Venus, Tori, if you could,'''
she recalls. ``Once I decided I was calling this `To Venus and
Back,' it was almost as if the songs from Venus decided to say
`These are fragments from Venus she's willing to show you this
time,' and I felt like I climbed up on this little satellite and
started roaming around her heart.''
 &HT;    If that sounds a little far-out, you've never spent any time
with Amos. Those who know her well from her work _ beginning with
``Little Earthquake'' (1992) _ are used to such mystical
pronouncements.
 &HT;    During the past eight years, Amos has established herself as an
idiosyncratic personality who also happens to be one of the most
arresting and provocative performers to emerge in decades, a
singer, songwriter and instrumentalist with a unique voice and
empathetic bent that's won her a rabid and sizable following.
 &HT;    A musical prodigy since the age of 5, when she began studying at
Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory, the former Myra Ellen Amos'
albums _ excepting the pop-tinged ``Y Kant Tori Read'' (1988) _
have been marked by distinctive approaches to songwriting and
arranging, with swooping, offbeat dynamics that have been imitated
by a legion of Lilith Fair-generation admirers.
 &HT;    In her lyrics, the minister's daughter has sung about being
raped at gunpoint and about seducing God. In ``To Venus and
Back's'' opening track and first single, ``Bliss,'' she details the
struggles between a daughter and a father, representing the latter
as both a divine and a parental entity.
 &HT;    Amos made a significant change with ``Choirgirl Hotel,''
however. It wasn't the first time she had employed other
instruments on record, but it was the first time she had used a
full band throughout. She even recorded most of the tracks live in
the studio with the other players.
 &HT;    ``The songs usually dictate what I'm going to do,'' Amos says,
adding that she usually hears ``loads of instruments'' in her head
while she's writing.
 &HT;    She's continued the full-band approach on ``Venus.'' Like
``Choirgirl Hotel,'' the album was produced by Amos and engineered
by her husband, along with Marcel van Limbeek. This time she used
the four musicians who accompanied her on the road after
``Choirgirl'' was released, who can also be heard on ``To Venus and
Back's'' live disc.
 &HT;    ``I think when you live nine months on a bus with guys, you
begin to know when all their periods are,'' says Amos, who tends to
assign female attributes to all facets of life. ``There's an
intimacy. The same people play on the live record that played on
the studio record ... So there's that continuity. We know what we
mean.
 &HT;    ``Like on `Concertina,''' she says, ``it was very much Jon
(Evans), the bass player _ who's a genius bass player _ but it was
`No, no, no. You are a fierce calm. You never let up.' And he knew
what I wanted.''
 &HT;    Working with a band presented a new challenge to Amos as
producer, too. But she says that, over time, she's becoming more
comfortable with that role as well.
 &HT;    ``I was really open to what all those knobs did in the studio,''
she says. ``I opened myself up to it on `Choirgirl.' It's like
synchronized swimming _ you work with a team and, after awhile, it
becomes improvisational, sonically. You trust that it's all going
to shift and change, and that doesn't frighten you. That fascinates
you.
 &HT;    ``And I'm somebody who goes right in there, all the way,'' she
says. ``You can see the intestines of the ant, microscopic, every
little detail. But the engineers are that way, too. They're really
hard-core, audio-pornography obsessed.''
 &HT;    Despite that adherence to detail, Amos reports that the making
of the album was relatively peaceful _ and quick, which was good,
since she went on to spend five and a half weeks on the road with
Alanis Morissette in a kind of summit of female pop powers. In
fact, she says, ``To Venus and Back'' was made in half the time she
usually takes to make a single set, which to her was ``like,
nuts.''
 &HT;    But she's not complaining, either.
 &HT;    ``We were very tweaked and very present, and this record was
demanding us to be very present,'' Amos says. ``And she was so
seductive, none of us could sleep. None of us wanted to sleep.
 &HT;    ``It was like some Dionysian frenzy _ we didn't want to stop,''
she says. ``It was a fierce calm, and I liked that.''

 (Includes a color slide of Heather Locklear and Michael J. Fox in a
scene from ``Spin City.'') 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talking Heather Locklear into joining the cast of ``Spin City''
wasn't that hard.
</P>
<P>
   When the former ``Melrose Place'' vixen was offered the chance
to co-star with Michael J. Fox in the popular ABC political sitcom,
shortly after her previous show closed up shop last spring, she had
only one question that needed to be answered: ``Where do I sign?''
</P>
<P>
   Locklear has been a television fixture since her 1981 debut on
``Dynasty,'' and by the time she heard from ``Spin City'' was
already weighing offers to join several other series, including
``Two Guys and a Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Spin City'' had an ace in the hole _ Locklear was a
regular viewer, and knew the show and star/executive producer Fox
intimately.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, world, even television stars watch television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's a clever, smart show,'' Locklear says. ``So,
being a fan of the show and of a cast that's so wonderful, it was
just an easy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox welcomed Locklear's arrival as a shot in the arm for ``Spin
City,'' which despite critical raves had only-decent ratings in its
first three years, and this year inherited the crucial slot in
ABC's Tuesday-night schedule formerly occupied by the top-rated
``Home Improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not kid ourselves,'' he says. ``She brings tremendous
attention and excitement to the show, and a real energy. Most
importantly, she's a nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   The new-look ``Spin City'' casts Locklear as Caitlin Kelly, a
no-nonsense political operative hired as campaign manager for New
York's Mayor Randall Winston (Barry Bostwick) as he plans a run for
the United States Senate. Her abrupt, miniskirted presence jars
mayoral assistant Mike Flaherty (Fox), who suddenly finds his
political clout in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Mike has been kind of king of the office for three
years now,'' Fox says, ``and he never really had anybody on his
level of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking it over, the show's writers decided that it would be
dramatically effective to introduce a strong female character to
shake up the show and put Mike on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we said, `Who will we cast?''' Fox recalls. ``And we
thought, `You know, in a perfect world, you get, like, Heather
Locklear.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So somebody said, `Let's make that call _ and then we'll move
on and figure out who's really going to do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And, I swear to God,'' he says with a laugh, ``the next day we
get this call saying Heather is very flattered, loves the show and
is considering doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Television being television _ and Locklear having the television
history she does _ there's already speculation that Fox and
Locklear will be paired off romantically. It's understandable,
given ABC's sassy promos, which feature Locklear slapping Fox,
throwing water in his face and then landing a big smacker right on
his lips.
</P>
<P>
   So is love in the air between these two?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is that potential any time you have two characters in an
antagonistic relationship,'' Fox says cryptically. ``But that's
down the road, so we're still exploring that.''
</P>
<P>
   Introducing any new romantic interest for Fox's character is
going to be a bit tricky, though. In last season's finale, Mike
Flaherty cheated on his statuesque, in-office girlfriend Nikki
(Connie Britton) by having a fling with supermodel Heidi Klum.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki won't be disappearing into thin air, Fox hastens to add.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still Mike-and-Nikki stuff to do,'' Fox says, ``and we
want that to always be a special relationship. They have a history
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Individually, both Fox and Locklear have outside factors
complicating their efforts to acclimate to one another. Locklear
became a mother for the first time last year, and to take the role
on ``Spin City'' she had to leave her Hollywood home with her baby
and her husband, rocker Richie Sambora, to move to New York, where
the show is taped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately I have a wonderful husband who grew up on the East
Coast,'' she says. ``But a little change is good for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a Canadian by birth, but by now considers himself enough
of an adopted New Yorker to be amused at Locklear's efforts to get
to know the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as New York goes, it's so funny, because Heather is
such a neophyte,'' he says. ``I mean, she has no idea. If you told
her, `Be in Greenwich Village and in five minutes meet me at
Central Park,' she'd say, `OK!'''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's situation is far less amusing, and far more complicated. A
year ago he revealed publicly that for several years he'd been
battling Parkinson's Disease. The nervous-system ailment is
degenerative and incurable, but Fox claims that his symptoms are
being kept under control through medication.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only concession he's made has been to switch ``Spin
City's'' taping night from Friday to Tuesday, in order to allow
himself a midweek rest break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good,'' he says, shrugging. ``It's like anything
when you have an ongoing condition ... It's something you monitor
on a daily basis and treat therapeutically.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel confident with my ability to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Locklear had never worked together before, but from
their first days on ``Spin City'' their chemistry was clearly
apparent. This didn't surprise him, Fox says, because he had
actually crossed paths with Locklear once before, when they shared
a table at the 1996 Golden Globe Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know if Heather will remember this,'' Fox says,
``but she was nominated and I was nominated, and we were way in the
back ... Kathy Bates was at our table, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't win and Heather didn't win,'' Fox recalls, ``but I
really enjoyed being with Heather. So when we talked about her
coming on this show, I knew she had what we wanted.''

PIERCE BROSNAN: JAMES BOND IS NOT ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not

 (Includes a color slide of Pierce Brosnan with Denise Richards in a
scene from ``The World Is Not Enough.'') 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It isn't easy being James Bond.
 &HT;    Just ask Pierce Brosnan, who makes his third appearance in the
role with ``The World Is Not Enough,'' opening Nov. 19.
 &HT;    Bond may dine at lavish gourmet restaurants and sip martinis _
shaken, of course, but not stirred _ but the actor who plays him
has to watch his figure.
 &HT;    ``I lay off the red wine and the cream sauces,'' Brosnan says
with a laugh. ``It's heinous being James Bond!
 &HT;    ``Before I do the love scenes,'' he adds, ``I have to remind
myself, `Pierce, you have been seminaked on stage before. You've
been naked on film.'
 &HT;    ``Then I look in the mirror and think, `Jesus, does my stomach
look flat enough?'
 &HT;    ``I'm like any woman preparing to show her body on screen in a
love scene,'' Brosnan admits. ``I live in the gym for months before
these movies. For God's sake, I lift large weights.''
 &HT;    Over coffee on a Sunday morning, the handsome actor is dressed
in white-silk slacks, a matching shirt and two days of facial
stubble. He likes to complain about being Bond but, rumors to the
contrary, he insists that this isn't his last spin as 007.
 &HT;    ``Contractually this is my last Bond film,'' he says. ``I'm
contracted for three, with the option of a fourth. And the last
three I've gone out the door with very quickly _ I've done these
movies rapidly to establish myself as the character.
 &HT;    ``Of course, now there are other characters I want to do who are
not James Bond,'' he adds. ``So I'm not in any hurry to do the
fourth Bond.''
 &HT;    On the other hand, he admits that he'd hate to see someone else
in the role.
 &HT;    ``Look, we'll do a fourth Bond,'' he says. ``I want to do a
fourth Bond.''
 &HT;    ``The World Is Not Enough'' has a lot of excitement, action and
suspense, Brosnan reports _ and one thing more.
 &HT;    ``Great title,'' he says in all due seriousness. ``I've always
been happy with all of my Bond titles _ except `Tomorrow Never
Lies,' which ironically is how it went to the print shop. There was
a typo and someone wrote, `Tomorrow Never Dies.' And the studio
said, `Damn it, we love it!'
 &HT;    ``But `The World is Not Enough' won't change,'' he says,
``because it's James Bond's motto from the original books _ that
was actually the family motto of the entire Bond family.''
 &HT;    The film shows a newer, slightly mellower Bond, the actor says.
 &HT;    ``In the new Bond we really paid attention to character,'' he
says. ``We have a story that has a bit more maturity than the other
two. Of course, it has action _ but I couldn't do just wall-to-wall
explosions. I just can't do it, it's boring.
 &HT;    ``I wanted an emotional content,'' he says, ``so you have
something to hold onto, and then you can jump off into the fantasy
of it all.''
 &HT;    The change in Bond merely reflects the evolution of the actor
behind him, he says.
 &HT;    ``Brosnan has changed,'' the actor says. ``I've gotten a bit
more comfortable with the role, and so much of acting is about your
confidence, relaxation and your faith in yourself, because you're
constantly being judged. The last two Bond movies have done well,
so I feel very relaxed in the role.
 &HT;    ``I also put my trust in Michael Apted, a documentarian and
diverse moviemaker who really added so much as our director.''
 &HT;    The latest film features the usual curvaceous ``Bond girls'' _
this time around, Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas Jones and Sophie
Marceau as Electra King. Robert Carlyle plays the latest villain, a
terrorist who is impervious to pain and thinks he can't die.
 &HT;    ``He dies,'' Brosnan says flatly. ``He ain't coming back.
Neither did any other Bond baddie I've been given. Good actors,
good Bond villains _ they ain't coming back. I killed them all. No
bouncing back.
 &HT;    ``I'm a lethal guy,'' he jokes, ``and don't you forget it.''
 &HT;    Brosnan's success as Bond is all the more striking in that, when
he was first offered the role in 1986, he was forced to decline due
to his obligations to his hit television show, ``Remington Steele''
(1982-1987). Timothy Dalton took the role in ``The Living
Daylights'' (1987), and it wasn't until ``Goldeneye'' (1995) that
Brosnan got his chance.
 &HT;    The success of ``Goldeneye'' and ``Tomorrow Never Dies'' (1997)
has made Brosnan a major star, but he shows little signs of
Hollywood ego.
 &HT;    ``I treat what I do like a hobby,'' he says. ``I don't let it
obsess me.
 &HT;    ``Yes, I have an ego,'' he adds. ``I want to win _ I always want
to win, I always want the best. You have to strive that high. I
admit that, as soon as I step out on stage, the show is about me.
That's the way it is, whether I'm playing two lines or my name is
above the title.
 &HT;    ``Apart from that, the joy of this career is keeping it in its
place.''
 &HT;    The death of his wife, Cassie, from ovarian cancer several years
ago helped give him a sense of perspective.
 &HT;    ``Her illness was completely unexpected,'' he recalls. ``It hit
me like a shot.''
 &HT;    He pauses, his voice choked with emotion.
 &HT;    ``I guess I learned that life doesn't cooperate with a man's
plans,'' he says. ``Her illness wasn't the way we talked about it
or planned our life. But it happens, and you just have to get on
with it and make the best of it.
 &HT;    ``I learned to appreciate the time we have here,'' he concludes.
``I appreciate everything now.''
 &HT;    Brosnan has a lot to appreciate _ being a movie star was his
boyhood dream since he saw ``The Thomas Crown Affair'' (1968), one
of the first films he encountered growing up in Drogheda in County
Louth, Ireland.
 &HT;    ``That was my introduction to the movies,'' he recalls, ``and I
left that theater wanting to be Steve McQueen. But then I went to
another movie, and I wanted to be Clint Eastwood. I was a
15-year-old kid in Ireland, living through the movies.''
 &HT;    Nowadays, however, the movies isn't enough. Brosnan also has a
2-year-old son, Dylan, whose mother is the actor's longtime
girlfriend _ and, recently, fiancee _ Keely Shaye Smith.
 &HT;    Say, Pierce, when's the wedding?
 &HT;    ``Give us a break, now,'' Brosnan begs, laughing. ``Just let us
find our space here. It's a good time for us.
 &HT;    ``Relationships take patience, love and understanding,'' he
says. ``We're learning how families work, which isn't always easy
in this world _ or especially in this business.''
 &HT;    Yes, movie stars have to face the ``terrible twos,'' just like
anyone else.
 &HT;    ``A few months ago we got on the plane from Los Angeles to
Nairobi for a family holiday,'' Brosnan recalls. ``Dylan had a
total meltdown, the poor boy. Suddenly I'm not James Bond anymore _
I'm making cow noises, and if people don't like it, tough.''
 &HT;    Believe it or not, Brosnan _ who also has two sons from his
first marriage _ recently became a grandfather, courtesy of his
stepdaughter, Charlotte.
 &HT;    ``We don't say `grandfather,''' he cautions. ``We say `pappy.'
`Granddad' is just not a word I want to put on myself right now.
Please don't call me that _ I'm still young and vital.
 &HT;    ``For God's sake, I'm James Bond!''

ROCK ON: CHRIS ROCK BRINGS HIS OWN PRIVATE EDGE TO `DOGMA'

 (Includes a color slide of Chris Rock with Linda Fiorentino in a
scene from ``Dogma.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Chris Rock stepped into the offices of Miramax Films with
visions of ``The Piano'' and ``Life Is Beautiful'' dancing in his
head.
 &HT;    And the powers that be in the Oscar factory handed him a script
called ``Joyride.''
 &HT;    ``I go to Miramax, the home of cool movies,'' says Rock, whose
film credits include the not-that-cool ``Boomerang'' (1992),
``CB4'' (1994) and ``Lethal Weapon 4'' (1998). ``I'd just won an
Emmy. I've got two Emmys. I'm all over the place. I'm hot, hot,
hot.
 &HT;    ``So I'm `Yeah, good. I'll do some good movies.''' he recalls.
``I get there and they offer me this, a movie with a bunch of
rappers on a bus going to make a video.''
 &HT;    Rock shakes his head and rolls his eyes.
 &HT;    ``I'm like, `Oh, my God, what the f--k is this?''' he says.
``You know what's weird? They offered me more money to date than
I've been offered for anything _ it was only a week's worth of
work.''
 &HT;    But Rock didn't give up so fast on his idea of getting in on
Miramax's cutting-edge independent-film lineup.
 &HT;    ``I said, `What's Kevin Smith doing?''' he says. ``I'd just seen
`Chasing Amy' (1997), and I loved it. It spoke to me _ I'd been in
love with girls with reputations and definitely didn't handle it
right.
 &HT;    ``And Kevin happened to be doing something. They let me see the
script.''
 &HT;    The script turned out to be ``Dogma,'' the year's most
controversial film. A black comedy about religion, it pits fallen
angels Loki (Matt Damon) and Bartleby (Ben Affleck) against a group
of unlikely heroes that includes God's messenger (Alan Rickman), a
Muse (Salma Hayek), mankind's all-too-human would-be savior (Linda
Fiorentino) and Rufus (Rock), the 13th apostle, who blames
political reasons for his exclusion from the Scriptures.
 &HT;    ``Dogma'' proved so controversial _ both in its provocative
religious ideas and its savage mocking of a corporate conglomerate
that strongly suggested the Walt Disney Company, Miramax's
corporate parent _ that the studio felt compelled to relinquish the
film after its completion. Lions Gate Films picked it up, and will
release it nationwide on Nov. 12.
 &HT;    Rock says he never even considered the possibility that
``Dogma'' might be too controversial for him.
 &HT;    ``Me?'' he asks, laughing.
 &HT;    Actually, he says during a conversation at New York's Regency
Hotel, he wouldn't mind going a lot further than writer/director
Smith does with ``Dogma.'' There are no limits at all, as far as
he's concerned.
 &HT;    ``Everything should be skewered and satirized,'' he says
matter-of-factly. ``Nothing is above jokes. You should be able to
see the funny side of everything.
 &HT;    ``I don't want to go to heaven if it ain't funny,'' he adds.
``If heaven ain't funny, it ain't heaven.''
 &HT;    Controversy comes easily to Rock. He began performing as a
stand-up comedian at age 17, he recalls, and his act consisted of
jokes about ``getting pizza and waiting for my girlfriend's period
to come.''
 &HT;    Growing up on the tough streets of Brooklyn's Bedford-Stuyvesant
neighborhood, Rock remembers being regularly beaten up and
ridiculed by white schoolmates. Religion never really played a
major role in his life, he says.
 &HT;    ``There were a lot of churches,'' the 33-year-old comedian says,
``and no sign of God.''
 &HT;    Rock later put his acerbic wit to use on ``In Living Color'' and
``Saturday Night Live,'' establishing a reputation as a fearless
funnyman. More recently, he was criticized for poking too much fun
at the likes of Ricky Martin when he hosted the 1999 MTV Awards.
 &HT;    He makes no apologies.
 &HT;    ``I think I kept the show going,'' Rock says. ``That was my job.
Where is it written that the host can't be a performer, too?
 &HT;    ``As long as you don't get personal with people,'' he says,
``you can pretty much get away with it.''
 &HT;    Besides ``Dogma,'' Rock has several other projects in the works
at the moment. The first issue of The Illtop Journal, which he
describes as ``a black version of The Harvard Lampoon,'' is due out
later this month, and he's completed the Neil LaBute comedy ``Nurse
Betty,'' which casts him and Morgan Freeman as hitmen seeking to
eliminate Renee Zellweger.
 &HT;    Early next year Rock will shoot ``I Was Made To Love Her,'' a
romantic comedy that he's co-written. In the meantime, though, his
primary focus is his HBO program, ``The Chris Rock Show.''
 &HT;    ``It's the most important thing I'm doing, artistically,'' he
says. ``It's important that it exists, because it's just a
different type of show _ it's different, from the interviews to the
comedy to the music.
 &HT;    ``There are no other black talk shows or entertainment shows at
all.''
 &HT;    The show's audience includes a substantial number of white
viewers, to the surprise of many observers _ but not of Rock
himself.
 &HT;    ``Comedy always crosses over, for the most part,'' Rock says.
``When I was a kid, we didn't say Rodney Dangerfield was a funny
white guy.''
 &HT;    Rock may be a star now, but he still remembers his leaner days,
toiling as a busboy at a local Red Lobster. Some of the people he
knew during those days still work at Red Lobster, he says, a few in
management capacities.
 &HT;    ``I was a busboy because I wasn't good enough to be a waiter,''
Rock says, smiling. ``There's nothing separating me from them,
except that I write a decent joke now and then.''
 &HT;    Well, the fact that he earns millions of dollars a year and gets
to make movies with major stars may be a bit of a distinguishing
factor. But Rock still lives in Brooklyn, and remains pretty
low-key for such a high-profile guy.
 &HT;    ``Celebrity is nonsense,'' he says. ``I look at it as people are
appreciating my work. There are a lot of celebrities who ain't
going to be here next year or six months from now or three months
from now. I'm just glad people are appreciating my work ...
 &HT;    ``I live good,'' he says. ``I dropped out of school, I'm a black
guy _ I live great.''
 &HT;    Which may be why he's always happy to turn his comic invective
against celebrities who whine about the inconveniences of stardom.
 &HT;    ``They're idiots,'' he says.

TORI AMOS' ROAD TO VENUS

 (Includes a color slide of singer Tori Amos.) 
 By GARY GRAFF  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Not so long ago, Tori Amos spoke of fairies that inspired her
songs and brought her ideas and melodies.
 &HT;    These days, however, she's hearing the clarion call of Venus.
 &HT;    Coming relatively hot on the heels of ``From the Choirgirl
Hotel'' (1998), Amos' new album, ``To Venus and Back'' (Atlantic
Records, 1999), is actually a happy accident, what was intended as
a B-side collection until it spun out of control and became a full
new set of songs _ in addition to a second disc of live recordings
from her 1998 tour.
 &HT;    ``The engineers started looking at me and said, `Theoretically,
this does not work in a B-side concept,''' says the Maryland-born
Amos, who resides in southwest England with her husband, engineer
Mark Hawley, and also produced ``To Venus and Back.'' ``I said `OK,
why?'
 &HT;    ``And they said, `It's like an ecosystem. You can't just extract
this out _ it'll feel random. It doesn't sonically have a geometric
shape.'
 &HT;    ``Now, they're engineers,'' she says with a laugh. ``They're out
of their minds. But they do understand that realm, and I began to
see it was valid what they were saying _ the B-side thing became
just so hodgepodge. It became clear it was to be a new work.''
 &HT;    Amos already had the title, too, from a conversation with
friends over a bottle of wine.
 &HT;    ``One of them said, `You'd go to Venus, Tori, if you could,'''
she recalls. ``Once I decided I was calling this `To Venus and
Back,' it was almost as if the songs from Venus decided to say
`These are fragments from Venus she's willing to show you this
time,' and I felt like I climbed up on this little satellite and
started roaming around her heart.''
 &HT;    If that sounds a little far-out, you've never spent any time
with Amos. Those who know her well from her work _ beginning with
``Little Earthquake'' (1992) _ are used to such mystical
pronouncements.
 &HT;    During the past eight years, Amos has established herself as an
idiosyncratic personality who also happens to be one of the most
arresting and provocative performers to emerge in decades, a
singer, songwriter and instrumentalist with a unique voice and
empathetic bent that's won her a rabid and sizable following.
 &HT;    A musical prodigy since the age of 5, when she began studying at
Baltimore's Peabody Conservatory, the former Myra Ellen Amos'
albums _ excepting the pop-tinged ``Y Kant Tori Read'' (1988) _
have been marked by distinctive approaches to songwriting and
arranging, with swooping, offbeat dynamics that have been imitated
by a legion of Lilith Fair-generation admirers.
 &HT;    In her lyrics, the minister's daughter has sung about being
raped at gunpoint and about seducing God. In ``To Venus and
Back's'' opening track and first single, ``Bliss,'' she details the
struggles between a daughter and a father, representing the latter
as both a divine and a parental entity.
 &HT;    Amos made a significant change with ``Choirgirl Hotel,''
however. It wasn't the first time she had employed other
instruments on record, but it was the first time she had used a
full band throughout. She even recorded most of the tracks live in
the studio with the other players.
 &HT;    ``The songs usually dictate what I'm going to do,'' Amos says,
adding that she usually hears ``loads of instruments'' in her head
while she's writing.
 &HT;    She's continued the full-band approach on ``Venus.'' Like
``Choirgirl Hotel,'' the album was produced by Amos and engineered
by her husband, along with Marcel van Limbeek. This time she used
the four musicians who accompanied her on the road after
``Choirgirl'' was released, who can also be heard on ``To Venus and
Back's'' live disc.
 &HT;    ``I think when you live nine months on a bus with guys, you
begin to know when all their periods are,'' says Amos, who tends to
assign female attributes to all facets of life. ``There's an
intimacy. The same people play on the live record that played on
the studio record ... So there's that continuity. We know what we
mean.
 &HT;    ``Like on `Concertina,''' she says, ``it was very much Jon
(Evans), the bass player _ who's a genius bass player _ but it was
`No, no, no. You are a fierce calm. You never let up.' And he knew
what I wanted.''
 &HT;    Working with a band presented a new challenge to Amos as
producer, too. But she says that, over time, she's becoming more
comfortable with that role as well.
 &HT;    ``I was really open to what all those knobs did in the studio,''
she says. ``I opened myself up to it on `Choirgirl.' It's like
synchronized swimming _ you work with a team and, after awhile, it
becomes improvisational, sonically. You trust that it's all going
to shift and change, and that doesn't frighten you. That fascinates
you.
 &HT;    ``And I'm somebody who goes right in there, all the way,'' she
says. ``You can see the intestines of the ant, microscopic, every
little detail. But the engineers are that way, too. They're really
hard-core, audio-pornography obsessed.''
 &HT;    Despite that adherence to detail, Amos reports that the making
of the album was relatively peaceful _ and quick, which was good,
since she went on to spend five and a half weeks on the road with
Alanis Morissette in a kind of summit of female pop powers. In
fact, she says, ``To Venus and Back'' was made in half the time she
usually takes to make a single set, which to her was ``like,
nuts.''
 &HT;    But she's not complaining, either.
 &HT;    ``We were very tweaked and very present, and this record was
demanding us to be very present,'' Amos says. ``And she was so
seductive, none of us could sleep. None of us wanted to sleep.
 &HT;    ``It was like some Dionysian frenzy _ we didn't want to stop,''
she says. ``It was a fierce calm, and I liked that.''

 (Includes a color slide of Heather Locklear and Michael J. Fox in a
scene from ``Spin City.'') 
 By ANDREW RYAN  
 c.1999 TV Guide Canada  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talking Heather Locklear into joining the cast of ``Spin City''
wasn't that hard.
</P>
<P>
   When the former ``Melrose Place'' vixen was offered the chance
to co-star with Michael J. Fox in the popular ABC political sitcom,
shortly after her previous show closed up shop last spring, she had
only one question that needed to be answered: ``Where do I sign?''
</P>
<P>
   Locklear has been a television fixture since her 1981 debut on
``Dynasty,'' and by the time she heard from ``Spin City'' was
already weighing offers to join several other series, including
``Two Guys and a Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Spin City'' had an ace in the hole _ Locklear was a
regular viewer, and knew the show and star/executive producer Fox
intimately.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, world, even television stars watch television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's a clever, smart show,'' Locklear says. ``So,
being a fan of the show and of a cast that's so wonderful, it was
just an easy decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox welcomed Locklear's arrival as a shot in the arm for ``Spin
City,'' which despite critical raves had only-decent ratings in its
first three years, and this year inherited the crucial slot in
ABC's Tuesday-night schedule formerly occupied by the top-rated
``Home Improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not kid ourselves,'' he says. ``She brings tremendous
attention and excitement to the show, and a real energy. Most
importantly, she's a nice person.''
</P>
<P>
   The new-look ``Spin City'' casts Locklear as Caitlin Kelly, a
no-nonsense political operative hired as campaign manager for New
York's Mayor Randall Winston (Barry Bostwick) as he plans a run for
the United States Senate. Her abrupt, miniskirted presence jars
mayoral assistant Mike Flaherty (Fox), who suddenly finds his
political clout in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Mike has been kind of king of the office for three
years now,'' Fox says, ``and he never really had anybody on his
level of power.''
</P>
<P>
   Thinking it over, the show's writers decided that it would be
dramatically effective to introduce a strong female character to
shake up the show and put Mike on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we said, `Who will we cast?''' Fox recalls. ``And we
thought, `You know, in a perfect world, you get, like, Heather
Locklear.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So somebody said, `Let's make that call _ and then we'll move
on and figure out who's really going to do it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And, I swear to God,'' he says with a laugh, ``the next day we
get this call saying Heather is very flattered, loves the show and
is considering doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Television being television _ and Locklear having the television
history she does _ there's already speculation that Fox and
Locklear will be paired off romantically. It's understandable,
given ABC's sassy promos, which feature Locklear slapping Fox,
throwing water in his face and then landing a big smacker right on
his lips.
</P>
<P>
   So is love in the air between these two?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is that potential any time you have two characters in an
antagonistic relationship,'' Fox says cryptically. ``But that's
down the road, so we're still exploring that.''
</P>
<P>
   Introducing any new romantic interest for Fox's character is
going to be a bit tricky, though. In last season's finale, Mike
Flaherty cheated on his statuesque, in-office girlfriend Nikki
(Connie Britton) by having a fling with supermodel Heidi Klum.
</P>
<P>
   Nikki won't be disappearing into thin air, Fox hastens to add.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still Mike-and-Nikki stuff to do,'' Fox says, ``and we
want that to always be a special relationship. They have a history
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Individually, both Fox and Locklear have outside factors
complicating their efforts to acclimate to one another. Locklear
became a mother for the first time last year, and to take the role
on ``Spin City'' she had to leave her Hollywood home with her baby
and her husband, rocker Richie Sambora, to move to New York, where
the show is taped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately I have a wonderful husband who grew up on the East
Coast,'' she says. ``But a little change is good for growth.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox is a Canadian by birth, but by now considers himself enough
of an adopted New Yorker to be amused at Locklear's efforts to get
to know the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as New York goes, it's so funny, because Heather is
such a neophyte,'' he says. ``I mean, she has no idea. If you told
her, `Be in Greenwich Village and in five minutes meet me at
Central Park,' she'd say, `OK!'''
</P>
<P>
   Fox's situation is far less amusing, and far more complicated. A
year ago he revealed publicly that for several years he'd been
battling Parkinson's Disease. The nervous-system ailment is
degenerative and incurable, but Fox claims that his symptoms are
being kept under control through medication.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only concession he's made has been to switch ``Spin
City's'' taping night from Friday to Tuesday, in order to allow
himself a midweek rest break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel pretty good,'' he says, shrugging. ``It's like anything
when you have an ongoing condition ... It's something you monitor
on a daily basis and treat therapeutically.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel confident with my ability to do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Locklear had never worked together before, but from
their first days on ``Spin City'' their chemistry was clearly
apparent. This didn't surprise him, Fox says, because he had
actually crossed paths with Locklear once before, when they shared
a table at the 1996 Golden Globe Awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know if Heather will remember this,'' Fox says,
``but she was nominated and I was nominated, and we were way in the
back ... Kathy Bates was at our table, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't win and Heather didn't win,'' Fox recalls, ``but I
really enjoyed being with Heather. So when we talked about her
coming on this show, I knew she had what we wanted.''

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with
minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez, generO+7_D3d &Cx1f; Q

<P>
   Deciding what kind of vehicle to acquire is tough enough, but
figuring out how to obtain you next vehicle can be even tougher. In
the end, no matter how lofty your dreams _ and how enticing those
ads with the unbelievably low monthly payments may be _ the
dollars-and-cents facts should bring you back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   With the median price of a vehicle hovering around $20,000, a
lot of consumers are turned off by some of the new high-tech
vehicles that are nice but out of reach. Which is why Toyota and
Ford are introducing low-priced models packed with big value. The
Ford Focus and Toyota Echo are aimed at young people who don't have
the big bucks to buy the big cars, yet both vehicles are big on the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Even the higher-priced lines are coming out with lower-priced
but value-packed models. Volvo has the S40 and V40 starting at
$23,000; Lincoln has the sporty and high-performance L series,
starting in the low 30s; Mercedes has added even more features to
its ``entry level'' C230 which starts around $31,000.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't have to look hard to get great performance and
safety, once only found in expensive models. The new Ford Taurus/
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Sable is packed with safety features, even receiving a
five-star rating from the National Safety Board. Volkswagen is
another great safety and performance value. Even young royals
appreciate VW. Prince William reportedly learned to drive on a Ford
Focus, but purchased a VW Passat. (Well, VW does own a bit of
British heritage in Bentley and for a while Rolls-Royce.)
</P>
<P>
   The secret to getting the most for your money in any new _ or
used _ vehicle is doing your homework. First do some comparison
shopping, looking at prices and models that appeal. Do a test
drive, not just around the block, but under conditions similar to
your normal driving experience _ on the highway, on rough roads,
checking out the vehicle's pickup. Do this with similar models _
there are performance and handling difference even between models
of the same make vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Check up on the reliability of the vehicle you are considering.
One of the best sources for such information is last April's
Consumer Reports annual auto issue. Sure, you're looking at reports
on '99s, but most 2000 models have few changes, especially
mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   Then do some pricing. First, decide on the make and model
vehicle you want. Note the sticker price with all the options you
desire. That's not the final price, just a basis to work from.
Next, find out what the vehicle cost the dealer, and what your
trade-in is worth. There are many sources for this information: one
of the most reliable is Consumer Reports, which for $12 will fax a
report with the invoice price, the sticker price, option prices,
equipment recommendations, rebates, dealer incentives, and advice
on how to negotiate. Information on your trade-in vehicle is an
additional $10. Leasing advice is also offered. To obtain the
reports call 800-933-5555.
</P>
<P>
   Especially useful is the information on rebates and incentives
since many are unadvertised. For example, Mercury is discontinuing
the Contour and is offering incentives of $1,500 to move them out.
Even many 2000 models have unadvertised incentives from
manufacturers. For example, the Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus
have customer incentives of $1,250 through Dec. 13; the Buick Park
Avenue has a $1,000 incentive on 2000 models, and a $3,000
incentive on '99s.
</P>
<P>
   From here you can bargain. Consumers Reports suggests offering 4
to 8 percent more than the invoice price on popular models. And
hold off mentioning any trade-in until a price is agreed on, this
way you'll really know what the dealer is offering for your old
car. If the vehicle you are buying is in demand, you'll probably
have to forget all this and pay the asking or sticker price. Last
year, a friend wanted a Mercedes M430 sport utility, a very desired
make and in limited production. She not only had to pay the sticker
price, but was offered the lowest wholesale price on her trade-in,
a Saab. She swallowed the sticker price, but sold her Saab in a
private deal.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like bartering, there are buying services, which
will do the work for you. They can be found in the Yellow Pages of
the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Homework is also important if you are considering a leased
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Leasing can be very attractive, especially when you compare the
monthly lease payments to what you may pay on a car loan. Then
there is the matter of the down payment. For sure, you will need a
hefty one if you buy, while many leases don't require much up-front
money.
</P>
<P>
   To help you decide if leasing is for you, consider how long you
intend to have the vehicle, and how many miles you are likely to
drive during that time. Most leases are 36 to 60 months. And most
leases, especially those with attractive payments, limit your
driving to 12,000 to 15,000 miles a year. Drive more than that and
you can be hit with some hefty mileage charges _ 10 to 15 cents a
mile times a few thousand miles can be costly. Leases can be
written for higher mileage, but at a higher price.
</P>
<P>
   All leases are based on the ``residual'' value _ what the bank
thinks your car or truck will be worth _ of the vehicle at the end
of the lease. You pay only for usage. Remember, you don't own the
vehicle, and the holder of the lease will want that car or truck
back in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports indicate that leasing has dropped a bit in
popularity. One reason is that manufacturers have cut back on
subsidizing leases, especially after making some wrong guesses as
to what the vehicles would be worth at the end of the lease and
losing money on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are now looking to the Internet to buy or lease. The
Internet is a great way to research various makes. Autosite.com,
for example, can help you decide between two makes with its easy to
use side-by-side comparison feature.
</P>
<P>
   For many consumer, one of the best features of shopping on the
Internet is the impersonal nature of it. No face-to-face
bargaining. You might even feel better making an offer on the Web.
One dealer says he prices his vehicles on the Internet as much as
$2,500 less than on his lot. Why? Because Internet users are
looking for low prices. To complete the sale, though, you'll still
have to go into the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   But whether you go kick tires, or use your mouse to find a new
vehicle, you need to know what's out there, what your dream is
really worth, and what your present set of wheels are worth. And,
keep in mind no matter what car or truck you settle on, it will
need service even if it does promise 100,000 miles between
tune-ups. Check out the warranty on the vehicle, and the dealer's
service department. That good deal from the sales department may
not be such a good deal after all if the mechanics and technicians
can't deliver.

RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AMENDMENT A BLUEPRINT FOR DISCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1999 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Ernest Istook, R-Okla., enjoys slamming his head against
the wall _ the wall that separates church and state.
</P>
<P>
   In September, he once again introduced his deceptively named
``religious freedom amendment'' (House Joint Resolution 66).
Istook's proposed amendment to the Constitution violates the intent
of the founders and the will of the states that ratified the First
Amendment back in 1791.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen months ago, the U.S. House rejected this same amendment
_ an amendment that, if ratified, would wreck the wall of
separation between church and state and destroy religious liberty
in our nation. But Istook isn't listening; he's playing the
politics of the Religious Right. The 66 members of the House who
are co-sponsors have earned their Religious Right credentials. And
if the amendment ever gets to the floor of the House, so will those
who vote for it.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal states that ``the people's right to pray ... on
public property, including schools, shall not be infringed.''
Students already have the right to pray in public schools, as long
as no other student is coerced to join and as long as prayer
sessions do not interfere with the normal running of the school.
</P>
<P>
   The wording of that clause, however, goes much further. It would
allow public school teachers to lead prayer in their classrooms.
Public school teachers work for local, county or state governments.
They are government employees. When a public school teacher leads a
class in prayer, the teacher is endorsing a specific religion or a
particular religious viewpoint _ over all other religious beliefs.
And from the teacher's elevated position, in the minds of
elementary school children, the teacher is favoring one religion
and snubbing a number of her students' religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   The founders did not want government or government employees
while on the job to endorse or to favor one religion over another
or to endorse religion over non-religion. For over 200 years as a
nation, our citizens have enjoyed freedom for religion and freedom
from religion. And that is precisely why we have religious liberty
matched by no other country in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In those nations where religion and government are wedded, there
is always persecution of religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The Istook amendment would also allow religious institutions to
apply for public funds. That would force the tax-paying public to
support religions in which they do not believe. Both Thomas
Jefferson and James Madison were vehemently opposed to a religion
tax. The founders believed that if a religion was vital, then it
would be self-sufficient. Only a lazy ministry will hold out a hand
for government dole.
</P>
<P>
   Istook knows, as every member of Congress knows, that with
government funding comes government control or government coercion.
Every state in this country has suffered from federal restrictions
tied to federal funds; religions will not be exempt from such
interference.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who takes a moment to think about this proposed amendment
must wonder whether Istook wants to destroy religions in America.
H.J. Res. 66 is a thoughtless, ill-conceived proposal that will do
exactly the opposite of what it claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention, the nation's largest Protestant
denomination, supports the Istook proposal and seems to be blind to
its real-life ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Southern Baptist Convention passed a
proselytization resolution to convert Jews to Christianity,
claiming that _ as former SBC president, The Rev. Bailey Smith,
bluntly put it _ ``God Almighty does not hear the prayer of a
Jew.'' The SBC's Home Mission Board has a mandate to ``develop
evangelistic ministries among Jews and start churches in
predominantly Jewish communities.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, 15,000 delegates to the Southern Baptist Convention met
in Salt Lake City with the express intent to evangelize Mormons to
the true religion. The SBC had prepared a training video titled
``The Mormon Puzzle'' to educate its members about the differences
between The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and
orthodox Protestant Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the SBC has urged its members to pray for
millions of Hindus. On Nov. 3, Hindus began the celebration of
Divali, the annual feast of lamps to honor the goddesses Lakshmi
and Parvati. That same day, the SBC launched a program of 12 days
of prayer to ``ask God to show Hindus that their worship of and
prayers to the gods ultimately are futile,'' according to the
prayer booklet the SBC prepared. The SBC booklet, entitled
``Divali: Festival of Lights, Prayer for Hindus,'' states with
stark assurance that Hindus suffer from ``darkness in their hearts
that no lamp can dispel.''
</P>
<P>
   The SBC plans another prayer guide, one that will focus on the
faults of Buddhism from a Christian perspective.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention can urge its members to pray for
whomever they chose. And, of course, they can even pray for those
whose religious beliefs they do not respect or understand. However,
if the Istook amendment was ratified, would a Hindu prayer be
tolerated in a public school where the majority of the students
were Southern Baptists?
</P>
<P>
   One would doubt it, based upon that statements SBC made about
Hinduism.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu child would be discriminated against by the students
and the very climate of the school.
</P>
<P>
   Would a lone Southern Baptist in a Jewish community tolerate a
Judaic prayer in the public school he or she attends?
</P>
<P>
   And why should a Hindu, Jew or Buddhist join or tolerate a
Southern Baptist prayer _ with the attitude the SBC has toward
those religions?
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in Houston, Texas or even Birmingham, Ala., is
Southern Baptist _ and certainly not many in upstate New York or
Massachusetts are. Classroom prayer in the public schools, with the
schools' vast diversity of children from different cultures and
religious backgrounds, will only lead to enmity and conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The Istook amendment is a blueprint for discord and intolerance
hidden behind a misleading title. Fortunately, it doesn't have a
chance of passing in the House with the required two-thirds
majority. Let's pray this is the last we see of H.J. Res. 66.

against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.

are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3

<TEXT>
<P>
   I slip into the driver's seat of my latest test car, snap on the
seatbelt and turn the ignition.
</P>
<P>
   The seatback comes up and forward, pushing my chest to the
steering wheel. The front of the seat rises, crunching my thighs.
And then the whole seat moves forward, amplifying all the crunching
and pushing that is going on. It's one of those automatic
driver-memory seats and the driver it is remembering certainly was
not built like me.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life when you slip behind the wheel of a new car every
week.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the questions I am most frequently asked by
those curious about my job, which is testing cars and writing about
them, is how long it takes to get used to the vagaries,
idiosyncracies, and basic operation of each car.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a demanding enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   I reach to the left of the steering column for the turn signal.
Finding the stem, I click it down. Suddenly, the car surges ahead,
picking up speed on its own. Baffled, I look down. I have hit the
resume mode for cruise control. I find the turn signal stem
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I am driving as the sun goes down and I turn on the headlights,
turning the controls clockwise as far as they will go. I drive on,
thinking the blue glow of these high-tech European headlights is
less illuminating than I would have expected. Soon, approaching
drivers are flicking their headlights at me. Do I have my brights
on? I click the dimmer switch. Nothing. I pull over, turn on the
interior lights and discover one of those idiosyncracies. On this
car, you can turn right past the headlights ``on'' position to
another where all you have lit up are side parking lights.
</P>
<P>
   These are funky variations. Others are more serious.
</P>
<P>
   On some cars, a steady pressure on the brake pedal will bring
you to a gradual, sure stop. On others, touch the brake pedal and
you are thrust against the seatbelt.
</P>
<P>
   Move from a week in a high-powered front-wheel drive car,
hellbent on torque steering you off the chosen line, and move into
a high-powered rear-wheel drive car and it takes some time behind
the wheel to stop watching out for torque steer and instead
watching for the moment the rear wheels try to break away.
</P>
<P>
   And there are wonderful, light-hearted moments that have found
me chuckling to myself as I explored _ on-the-job-training _ the
intricacies of dashboards and their knobs and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   I have reached out, mind still set on the previous car and not
the one I am driving that moment, and hit the button for more heat.
The radio responded by going up so loud it set my eardrums to
ringing.
</P>
<P>
   I have pulled up to toll booths, hit the button to lower my
window, and set off my emergency flashers _ all the better to
attract attention to this lout who is now holding up the toll line
as he searches the car for the window buttons.
</P>
<P>
   I have missed important moments in Red Sox games, rolling into
the broad reaches of New England where Boston stations fade out and
I need to find a local broadcast of the game, all because I could
not figure out how to tune the radio.
</P>
<P>
   I fairly toasted a daughter on a hot summer day _ ``Ah, dad.
Why's this seat so hot?'' _ when I hit the seat heating button,
thinking I was turning up the fan. This same daughter has a radar
for the hidden cupholders I can never seem to find on my own.
</P>
<P>
   I have opened sunroofs in the rain, rolled down back windows by
mistake, popped a trunk lid trying to automatically lock the doors,
and spent embarassing minutes at gas pumps trying to figure out how
to open the lid covering the gas cap.
</P>
<P>
   Each car is a new adventure wrapped in a puzzle. The puzzle
always gets solved, but sometimes it takes a while. But it is what
is great about driving a new car each week. Something to learn
every time.
</P>
<P>
   Another daughter once showed me how cars and culture can at
times be at odds.
</P>
<P>
   One rule on these test cars is that no one is supposed to smoke
in them _ but occasionally a prior occupant has done just that.
</P>
<P>
   That is how it happened that this daughter _ in an age when
smoking is dying as fast as smokers _ opened the ashtray in the
dash, saw that it was filled with cigarette butts and uttered,
``Gross, Dad. Somebody put cigarette butts in the coin thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many of the moments of searching and uncertainty I
experience are self-inflicted. I could, afterall, read the
instruction booklets thoroughly before hitting the road.
</P>
<P>
   But I am a man. And that would be like asking for directions.

<P>
   These may be the best of times for buyers of automobiles, both
aficiandos and those just looking for solid transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have so many manufacturers built so many good,
reliable autos. The worst car at this year's shows is probably a
safer, more reliable car than most of the best built 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Never has there been such a range of choice, from the smallest,
least expensive to the pricey, gargantuan SUVs. Sports coupes and
sports sedans. Trucks that are SUVs and SUVs that are nearly cars.
Cars that talk to you as they guide you on your journey; cars that
you can talk to _ tell them to place a phone call or boost the
radio volume _ and they will respond. Cars that protect you
immensely in driving _ with ABS brakes and driver-assist antispin
features. (These new safety features also mean we have to rethink
the way we teach driving to young people; those of us who have been
driving for some time will also have to learn new techniques. There
are, doubtless, folks reading this piece who don't know, for
instance, that you don't pump ABS brakes when you want to come to a
quick stop.)
</P>
<P>
   And finally, never before has there been such a dichotomy in
design and manufacture _ the auto industry's challenge. Everyone is
trying to build the Swiss Army Knife of cars/SUVs/trucks. All
buyers need do is pick out the blades and appliances they want.
</P>
<P>
   Spend $88,000 on an Acura NSX if you want speed and have the
money. Spend in the $10,000 range for a Toyota Echo or a new Ford
Focus.
</P>
<P>
   The car companies are designing for all of us, young and old,
sporty and sedate. How do you build cars that suit a physically
aging baby boom generation? Cars that suit the already elderly?
Cars that suit a young generation that has grown up with computer
joysticks in hand and expects computer-quickness in its cars? Cars
that suit families? Autos for parents who want to haul their kids,
fetch their own lumber for weekend projects, and go out for dinner
on Saturday night in sedan-whisper quiet _ all in the same auto.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible and these are times of great possibility.
</P>
<P>
   --Do you want the Ford Excursion _ biggest yet of the SUVs and
labeled the ``Ford Valdez'' by environmental critics _ or do you
want the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius _ small hybrids, running on
gasoline and batteries and getting upwards of 60 and 80 miles per
gallon?
</P>
<P>
   --Do you want a sports coupe _ say the snappy Honda S2000, with
its red line at nine grand _ or a sports sedan, seating 5, and
snappy in its own way, like the Acura 3.2 TL or the Nissan Maxima
with a 222 horsepower engine?
</P>
<P>
   --Do you want an SUV or a pickup truck? Or how about a pickup
truck with four doors that seats six and has that one thing the SUV
does not have _ a bed in the back?
</P>
<P>
   --Do you want economical _ $10,000 to $18,000 being economical
these days _ or do you want more luxury. Luxury itself has been
split into many levels _ low-luxury starting at around $20,000 (the
Maxima comes to mind again); mid-luxury starting around $30,000; or
upper luxury at $50,000 and upwards. It can be confusing because
there are $23,000 cars out there that are in many ways as good as
some being sold for much more.
</P>
<P>
   --And how will you shop? Go tussle with a salesman? Go on line?
However you do it, you can go in armed with more knowledge than
ever before, thanks to myriad Web sites that rate autos and tell
you how much you should pay for them _ and how much you should get
for the one you are turning in. (An estimated 2.8 million people
researched new and used car purchases before putting down any money
in 1999.)
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999 model year, 16.8 million new autos were sold, the
most ever, topping by 1.2 million the previous high, set in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   We are buying cleaner, safer, more powerful cars. Cars that come
with more and more ``luxury'' items as standard equipment: power
windows, tilting and telescoping steering wheels, power door locks,
power mirrors (heated, yet).
</P>
<P>
   The new Jaguar S Type has an option that lets you control
climate and radio by voice command. How long before this is a
standard safety feature _ no more distractions while fiddling for
the right knob, the right button or dial?
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems, still optional, are leapfrogging each other
in content. The new Acura 3.5 RL has a navigation system that has
added millions of ``points of interest'' in just one year of
evolution. While we are still dependent on satellites _ and
therefore, the military's slight fudging of signals for national
security reasons _ a new land-based navigation system is being
developed. It will place 300-foot towers at 53 sites around the
country on old Air Force property.
</P>
<P>
   Choices will continue to unfold as automakers scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, in a report entitled ``The Automotive Battlefield
2000-2003'' gives us a peek at what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   --Seventy-five percent of the models sold in 1998 will be
replaced by new models in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   --Truck bodies built on car platforms will become more
prominent, with 28 new or next generation models expected over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   --The lifecycles of new models will continue to compress,
dropping to 2.5 years by 2003 as opposed to 3.2 years from 1996 to
1999.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a market of niches and the manufacturers' use of
shared platforms _ as in putting light truck bodies on car
platforms _ will help to fill many of them.
</P>
<P>
   We now have shared platforms appearing on the Toyota Camry and
the Toyota Sienna van; the New Beetle from VW and the Audi TT; the
Plymouth Neon and Chrysler PT Cruiser; the Ford Excursion and Ford
F-Series pickup; and when Ford brings back the Thunderbird, it will
share its platform with the Jaguar S-Type.
</P>
<P>
   Some things to watch for:
</P>
<P>
   --A shakeout in the luxury market as buyers weight bucks against
bang. Volvo is out with a sedan and wagon in the low 20s; Mercury's
Sable offers better steering, suspension and transmission than in
the past and more oomph from a 3.0 liter V-6 engine. The $20,000 to
$40,000 price range is a goldmine for discerning shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   --Station wagons are making a comeback. Volvo added the small
V40 to its lineup; Saab now has a wagon; BMW will send its 3 Series
wagon here.
</P>
<P>
   --Aging baby boomers could go in one of two directions _ snappy
sports sedans or laid-back luxury.
</P>
<P>
   For those who feel the need for speed, sports sedans to watch
include the Acura 3.2 TL, the Pontiac Bonneville SSEi, Chrysler's
300M, the Nissan Maxima, the Lincoln LS, the Lexus ES 300, the I30
Infiniti and Chevrolet's Monte Carlo SS _ a luxury sedan with hot
damn good ol' boy written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   For boomers feeling a bit grayer and ready to slow down, Toyota
has turned the Avalon into their type of car _ kicked back, less
sporty, quiet, smooth and dependable. Same for the Acura 3.5 RL.
</P>

   As the boomers age, their children _ the Echo Boomers _ are the
target of the new wave of small, reliable, and inexpensive autos.
The Echo and the Focus join this list, along with the VW Golf, and
Daimler Chrysler says a mini version of the Neon will follow.
</P>
<P>
   For young and old with a few bucks to spend, there are hot new
sports cars: the Honda S2000 (watch for price gouging on this
$30,000 car); the Audi TT in coupe and roadster form; a new M3 from
BMW to go with the Z3 and M Coupe; and at lesser prices the
Mitsubishi Eclipse 2(plus)2, the Toyota Celica GT-S, and Toyota's
MR Spyder, a high perofrmance, mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive
roadster.
</P>
<P>
   On the truck and SUV front, cross-pollination is the order of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs continue to get carlike: the Lexus RX300 sitting on a
Toyota Camry sedan chassis; Mercedes and BMW are coming out with
SUVs, developed on race tracks, which reach speeds up to 155 mph.
And look for an Acura SUV to be introduced in Detroit this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks get ever more SUV-like: four doors, smoother,
quieter rides, seating for up to six. Chevrolet, Toyota, and Nissan
are heavy into this market this year. Ford has been there, watching
its F-Series sales of four-door pickup trucks climb from around 10
percent of its total pickup truck sales just three years ago to
more than 80 percent of its anticipated total pickup trucks sales
in the upcoming model year.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in minivans _ a slowed market compared to past years but a
solid one nonetheless (Mazda is counting on a small, front-wheel
drive van to help boost its sales) _ and the permutations of metal
and power in which you can wrap yourself are endless.
</P>
<P>
   And this as (again, no ``M'' word here) our full first century
of auto production closes and a bolder century full of
technological and innovative possibility looms.

SAFETY BECOMING STANDARD FARE 
</HEADLINE>

 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Safety is taking on new meaning with the 2000 models.
</P>
<P>
   While few will argue that vehicles need features to protect the
driver and passengers, there is some debate about what those
features should be, and how they should work. Air bags, in
particular, have been both hailed for how well they protect, and
criticized for how dangerous they can be to driver and passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Air bags have been proven to prevent serious injuries and death.
However, there have been problems primarily with smaller people who
may be sitting too close to an air bag when it opens, and to
infants placed in the front passenger seat of a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Both these issues have been addressed in many models in the 2000
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Because buyers want a safe environment, car manufacturers are
adding new features, many of them to lower-priced vehicles.
Mercedes-Benz, for example, has long had a lead in introducing
safety features on their more expensive models, but these features
are now showing up on the company's ``entry-level'' vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Antilock brakes, once an expensive option, are now found across
the board as standard equipment or as a fairly low-priced option.
Many safety advocates urge consumers to consider antilock brakes a
necessity rather than an option, however. While it's impressive to
know a car can do 0 to 60 mile per hour in less than 6 seconds, it
is more comforting to know it can do 60 to 0 mph in as few seconds,
and do it without pulling the vehicle into the path of another car.
</P>
<P>
   Answering air bag concerns for short drivers are the
electrically adjustable foot pedals found on Ford, Mercury, and
Lincoln products. These allow the driver to raise the pedals
without having to push the seat too close to the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes has been offering a child sensing device in the front
passenger seat, that combined with the use of a specially designed
child safety seat, shuts off the air bag on the passenger side.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's new Seville has sensors that prevent the air bags
from deploying if the seat is occupied by a small child. The system
works with both the front and side air bags. The sensors measure
the weight and posterior of the occupant to distinguish a child
from a lightweight adult. The rear-view mirror contains a light
that indicates if the air bag has been switched off.
</P>
<P>
   Most manufacturers are now offering ``second generation'' or
low-impact airbags to help reduce injury when the bags open. On its
5 and 7 series, BMW uses a dual-system frontal air-bag system that
deploys the bag as gently or as powerfully as needed, depending on
crash severity. Another example of safety technology becoming more
widely available is the BMW 3 series, which is offering rear-side
impact air bags as an option. Until this year, those air bags were
offered only on the BMW 5 and 7 series.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mercedes and Volvos have curtain-type bags that help
protect heads and necks in side-impact crashes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Whiplash is a major concern in accidents. Mercedes-Benz, Volvo,
and Saab all offer systems to prevent whiplash, and this year Buick
becomes the first domestic car to offer a whiplash-prevention
system. Similar to the Saab's system, the Buick system, refereed to
as a ``Catcher's Mitt,'' begins with special backing inside the
seat. On impact, as the body is forced into the seat back, the head
restraint is activated, rising up and out to reach the occupant's
head, reducing the head's motion and, hopefully, neck, back, and
spine injuries. Ultimately, the seat absorbs the body's energy as
it's forced backwards into the seat and helps keep the passenger's
pelvis and lower back in proper alignment. The head rest is
designed to automatically fall back and reset in place.
</P>
<P>
   Warning drivers behind you of an impending stop can also aid in
preventing accidents. The Cadillac DeVille is the first vehicle
with LED taillights. LEDs can illuminate in 0.1 millisecond vs. the
200 milliseconds of incandescent bulbs. That translates into an
additional 17.6 feet of warning for drivers behind the Cadillac
DeVille.
</P>
<P>
   The DeVille also features a Night Vision system that can ``see''
three to five times farther ahead than the low-beam headlights
reveal. Any object, i.e. potential safety hazard, is projected onto
the lower part of the windshield. The system also helps reduce the
glare of oncoming vehicles' headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is the first automaker to include an emergency trunk
release as standard equipment for its passenger cars. Last year, 11
children died after being trapped inside car trunks. General Motors
and other manufactures will also soon be offering the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Windstar minivan, and now the Cadillac DeVille and
other makes offer warning systems when backing up. The systems
sound an alarm as an object gets closer. Mercedes goes a step
farther with its S class system that automatically slows the
vehicle down if it gets too close to another.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dangers of driving an SUV is that in a collision with
a car, the car could submarine beneath the SUV. Among SUVs,
Mercedes has bumpers placed low enough to prevent this. For the
Ford Excursion _ the biggest SUV of all _ a bumper-like
``BlockerBeam'' crossmember (a lower bumper) is located at the
front of the vehicle 2.5 inches below and 6.5 inches behind the
main bumper. The beam is designed to engage the frame rails of a
car in the event of a collision, preventing the Excursion from
riding up and over the car. The Excursion has a similar system in
the rear that also serves as a mount for the trailer hitch.
</P>
<P>
   While many feel an all-wheel-drive system is a plus when it
comes to safety when the roads are wet or covered with snow, you
don't have to buy a big sport utility vehicle to have it. Subaru
uses all-wheel-drive throughout its lineup, and others, such as
Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Volkswagen, Audi, and DaimlerChrysler offer
it on selected cars, station wagons, and minivans. This year,
Subaru is adding daytime running lights as standard equipment. BMW
offers drivers a choice of running with daytime lights on or off.

HYBRIDS MAKE A POWER PLAY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How would you like to have a car that sells for less than
$20,000 and promises up to 70 miles a gallon?
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed gas-guzzling SUVs were taking over the
highways, two automakers are ready to unveil economic and
environmental alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   These are not electric-powered vehicles that can't be driven too
far without getting all charged up, or might have problems starting
in cold weather. These so-called hybrid vehicles will be very much
like the cars most of us are driving now, equipped with antilock
brakes; airbags, front and side; power windows, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Having driven the Toyota Prius along Boston streets and
highways, I can vouch for its handling, room, and responsive power.
The Prius and its counterpart Honda hybrid, the Insight, use both
gasoline and electric engines for power.
</P>
<P>
   When pulling away from a stop or under a light load, only the
electric motor kicks in. Under normal driving conditions, power
from the gasoline engine is divided between the wheels and the
electric generator. During deceleration or braking, the motor
functions as a generator to recharge the batteries. Thus, the
batteries never need to be recharged from an external source.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the system is a power-split transmission that sends
engine power either directly to the wheels or to the generator
controling the electric motor or battery state-of-charge. The
power-split device uses a planetary gear to constantly vary the
amount of power supplied from the engine to either the wheels or
generator. And, it's all done seamlessly.
</P>
<P>
   When driving the Pirus, I couldn't tell whether the vehicle was
on gas or electric power. The only clue is on a 5.8-inch wide
multi-function monitor that shows the condition and energy flow of
the hybrid drive system. (It can also serve for a navigation
system.)
</P>
<P>
   To help boost system efficiency, Prius is fitted with a
regenerative braking system. If the vehicle is coasting or the
brakes are applied, the motor is turned into a generator, capturing
energy that would normally be lost as heat or kinetic energy and
transforming it into electricity to recharge the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota says the Prius cuts nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide
emissions by 90 percent and hydrocarbons from 75 to 90 percent
beyond current stringent standards.
</P>
<P>
   While we only tested an early Japanese right-hand drive model,
the four-door sedan was quite comfortable and roomy with plenty of
room for four, maybe five. The trunk seemed a bit small, but this
vehicle is really designed for city use, although it appears it can
do quite nicely on the open highway. Toyota styled the car in its
California studios.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota has been marketing the car in Japan since December 1997
and has had phenomenal success, selling more than 27,000 models.
When the Prius arrives in America in mid-2000, Toyota is setting an
initial volume of 1,000 units a month for its dealerships in the 49
continental states. It is expected to sell for around $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's hybrid, the Insight, will beat Toyota to the showrooms,
arriving sometime in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight will be a two-door with a two-plus-two seating
configuration. It will be powered by a 1.0-liter, 65 horsepower,
3-cylinder VTEC gas engine supplemented by an electric motor. Like
the Toyota, the battery pack is recharged by both the gas engine's
power and regenerating power when the car's brakes are applied.
</P>
<P>
   A lightweight aluminum frame and plastic fenders fore and aft
keep the Insight's weight below 2,000 pounds to aid economy.
Standard safety items include driver and passenger side airbags,
antilock brakes, power windows, and locks along with remote keyless
entry.
</P>
<P>
   The American version of the Prius will be similar to the
Japanese version but some specifications and design touches are
expected to change. Actual specifications will be announced shortly
before it is introduced here.

TRUCKS THAT ARE LIKE CARS THAT ARE LIKE MINIVANS . . .

   There was a time when a truck was, well, a truck. It was used
for hauling construction equipment, moving furniture, picking up
sheets of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks are still used for those purposes, but today's trucks are
more carlike, even becoming the vehicle of choice for everyday
transportation. And with this evolution, comes some interesting
hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Chrysler PT Cruiser. Is it a truck, minivan, or
car? DaimlerChrysler says it's a truck. This novel looking
Neon-based vehicle looks like anything but a truck. No matter,
DaimlerChrysler says it is a truck; some say DaimlerChrysler is
giving it that label because federal fuel-economy standards for
trucks are less stringent than for cars.
</P>
<P>
   For those who still like their trucks to look like trucks, there
also is a wide variety of offerings.
</P>
<P>
   One of this year's more interesting trucks is the ``family
styled'' Nissan Frontier with a large cab with four regular doors
and a short bed. The bed is too short to carry a 4-by-8 foot sheet
of plywood, but Nissan has a nice touch for when you do want to lug
something, maybe not that long, but longer than the bed allows.
It's called a bed extender and it can swing out and rest on the
tailgate allowing longer loads to be carried with ease. The
Frontier Crew Cab can also be equipped with a tubular-style
heavy-duty roof rack that can be fitted with attachments to carry
everything from skis to mountain bikes allowing you to stack up the
truck bed with the rest of your gera.
</P>
<P>
   Other small trucks include the Chevrolet S pickup, Dodge Dakota,
Ford Ranger, GMC Sonoma, Isuzu Hombre, Mazda B series, and Toyota
Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   In the full-sized truck category, the Chevrolet Silverado and
GMC Sierra now have four doors available on the cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, which last year entered the full-sized truck arena with
the Tundra, is adding a four-door version to its lineup as well.
New for the Dodge Dakota is a four-door Quad Cab version that will
seat up to six people. The cab features full-sized, front-hinged
rear doors with full roll-down windows. Adding to its hauling
capacity, the pickup box can carry a 1,450-pound payload. Dodge is
also offering lots of engine choices: a standard 175-horsepower V-6
Magnum, or optional V-8s, one with 235 horsepower, the other at 245
horsepower. A new four-speed automatic transmission with dual-ratio
second gear is also an option. Three drive trains are offered: two
wheel, part-time four wheel, or full-time four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Other full-sized truck makes include the Dodge Ram, Ford F
Series, and Ford Super Duty. Four doors are now found on all.

   The 2000 model year promises to be a good year for consumers in
the market for a new set of wheels. The millennium models are
coming better equipped, without higher price tags. There is also a
new competitiveness. Ford is aiming to win back the sales crown
from Toyota with a revamped Taurus, for example. And both Ford and
Toyota are hoping to muscle their way into the small car field by
introducing brand-new models.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai is also coming on strong in the small car field with a
redesigned Accent. With the company's new emphasis on quality and
great warranties, Hyundai is a make to check out. Nissan's Sentra
will have more power and looks. Nissan also will offer a slightly
more expensive version of the Sentra that features a new catalytic
converter that traps hydrocarbons and hangs onto them until they
can be burned off later by the hotter exhaust of the warmed up car.
The result, Nissan claims, is an exhaust no dirtier than the air we
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Toyota took the car sales crown, selling 476,752
Camrys compared to Honda's 415,960 Accord sales and 367,582 sales
of the Ford Taurus. Even with those sales, Toyota was still third
on the list of top 10 sellers for 1999. Six of the models on the
list, including the top two, were trucks: No. 1 was the Ford
F-Series with 867,441 sales; next was the Chevrolet C/K pickup at
616,693.
</P>
<P>
   This year Ford is dropping its tear-drop styling for a more
conventional look for the Taurus, which it is packing (ditto
Mercury Sable) with more room, power, and safety. The two model
lines have all-new sheetmetal, more horsepower, all-speed traction
control, optional power pedals, inside trunk release, and front and
side air bags.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Mercury is reporting its models are proving very
popular, especially the New England Edition of the Sable that comes
with a free moon roof and ABS, a $1,400 value. Apparently New
Englanders know a good value when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   Arch rival Chevrolet is also coming on strong with an all-new
Impala and a sporty Monte Carlo. Adding to the punch will be a new
Cavalier, Chevy's hottest selling car.
</P>
<P>
   The new Impala will come in two models, the Impala sedan, which
has a standard V-6, and the LS model, which has the 3800 SFI V6
with 200 horsepower. The roomy Impala also offers ABS, traction
control, tire inflation warning, 16-inch wheels, and dual-control
climate zone. The Monte Carlo coupe, while sharing Impala's
wheelbase and engines, has its own sheetmetal for a more sporty
look.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is taking solid aim at the youth market with its Echo, a
new entry that is bigger all around than its predecessor, the
Tercel. Echo's interior is as roomy as the more expensive Corolla.
What's more, the Echo will start at $10,000, with a well-equipped
model costing around $12,500. For that price, you get air
conditioning, power steering, sport body kit, and a radio with CD
and cassette player. Adding to Echo's appeal is the promise of
peppy performance and gas mileage of 38 to 52 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Focus is also designed for space and youth. It claims
more head, cargo, and leg room than anything in its class. The
Focus will be available first as a four-door sedan. Later,
three-door coupe and wagon versions will be offered. The Focus will
be powered by a 2-liter engine and have a choice of manual or
automatic transmission. In addition, the Focus will be sold in
customized editions. ``We don't believe in the one-size-fits-all
theory. Young people really define themselves,'' says Julie Roehm,
brand manager. So, look for some special packages for the Focus: a
pet package that includes bed, water bottle, bowl and pockets for
treats; or an ``express yourself'' version with car decals, gear
shift, seat wardrobe and wheel cover. Another option provides a
voice recorder, notepad holder, and work station. The Focus was to
replace the Escort, but Ford plans on selling both models for now.
</P>
<P>
   In the sport utility field, BMW claims its X5 performs and
handles like one of its sedans. Nissan has the Xterra, to appeal to
active young people, and Mercedes-Benz has the ML55 with a
340-horsepower engine that will blast away just about anything on
the road, doing 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than 6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Ford brings out the biggest SUV of all, the Excursion, to
finally top the GM Suburban, which has held the size title since
1935. (Of course, no one knew what a sport utility vehicle was back
then.) General Motors is countering Ford with a totally redesigned
and more powerful Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon .
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Chrysler PT Cruiser. Chrysler calls it a truck,
but consumers may have a different opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In the minivan field, Mazda is offering its all-new, front-drive
MPV with innovative seating choices and roll-down sliding door
windows. Chevrolet is dressing up its Venture minivan with a video
system for rear seaters that includes free flicks from Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   BMW introduces a new 3 coupe and has a 3 wagon on the way. The
Pontiac Bonneville is all new with a longer wheelbase, stiffer
ride, and wider track. It's also offered with turbocharged power in
the SSEi model.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has revamped its Maxima, coming up with 22 additional
horsepower by redesigning the exhaust system, and the Maxima can
now go 100,000-miles before a tune up is required.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti has given the I30 a boost, packing it with new
equipment while holding the price at around $30,000. The car comes
with a 227-horsepower engine, Xenon headlights, an active
front-seat head restraint system, and 200-watt Bose audio system
with seven speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Honda is putting fun back into driving with its newest entry,
the S2000 sports car. A hot performing two seater, this high-tech
roadster will be priced around $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar is moving into the mass market with its new S-Type sedan.
Selling in the mid-$40,000 range, this rear-drive vehicle is sure
to heat up sales. Almost overlooked is another model from Jaguar, a
super-charged 370 horsepower XK8.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile is jumping the gun on 2001 by introducing the all-new
Aurora early in 2000. It is the first redesign since the car
debuted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn is growing in size. This year an L (for large) series
comes in sedan and wagon models alongside the S cars and wagons.
The L models come with a choice of a four-cylinder or a V-6 engine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best alternatives to sport utility vehicles is a
Subaru. All-wheel drive is featured throughout the line, and this
year the third generation Legacy and Outback are better than ever,
even roomier. Outback, previously just a wagon series, has added a
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, too, has a winner in its new ``entry level'' LS
rear-drive sedan. Built on the same platform as the Jaguar S-Type,
it handles beautifully and is a real performer.
</P>
<P>
   Park Avenue, Buick's full-sized luxury flagship model, is the
first domestic car to offer whiplash protection. It also has GM's
StabiliTrak handling system.
</P>
<P>
   A nameplate from the past is being revived at Saab. Areo, which
has been ranked as a true touring sedan with great performance,
returns in the 9-5 model line, and like its predecessors, it
promises to be a winner with a turbocharged four-cylinder,
230-horsepower engine.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac is redoing its Northstar V-8 to take regular gas
instead of the more expensive 93 octane. Cadillac is also offering
the all-new DeVille, loaded with safety and comfort systems, many
of which are unavailable in any other vehicle. DeVille comes with a
night vision sensing device, STabilTrak, and three-zone climate
control inside.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz has all-new S430 ($69,700) and S500 ($77,850)
sedans. Both are lighter than previous models, but packed with
performance and safety features. Also arriving are a new CLK 430
Cabriolet with four seats, and for the performance-oriented sport
utility fan, the 340-horsepower ML55 that can do 0 to 60 m.p.h. in
less than 6 seconds. Mercedes also is introducing designer editions
with unique paint and upholstery colors on its roadsters, coupes,
and S-Class and E-Class sedans. What is truly amazing is that
Mercedes is offering vehicles at an almost affordable price _ the
C230 sedan starts at $31,750 with free maintenance for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Alphabetically speaking, Volvo is last, but certainly not least,
in the auto world. For 2000, Volvo has added two nifty compacts,
the S40 sedan and V40 wagon. Starting at around $23,000 these
vehicles are packed with traditional Volvo features.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many car and truck debutes this year, shoppers
shouldn't overlook the other models, that is, the ones that don't
look much different from a '99. Even these vehicles have changes.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus, for example, has no ``all new'' models, but it has done
some upgrading to make the line more attractive. The ES 300, for
example, has an optional Brake Assist safety system that can detect
panic braking and augment the brake pressure applied by the driver.
The feature is now standard on the GS 400/300, LS 400 and LX 470
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus is entering its 10th year of selling in the United States.
In its first year, the company had just two models and sold 63,000
cars. Since then Lexus has changed the face of the luxury market.
This year Lexus offers six models, cars and SUVs, and has become
the No. 1 selling luxury make, outselling all its US and German
competitors.

<P>
   Recently, I was driving a long distance and hoped I had enough
gas to complete the trip without stopping for fuel. About 15 miles
from my destination, the gasoline warning light came on. Knowing
that most cars have 2 1/2 gallons of fuel left at that point, I
took the calculated risk that I could get where I was going without
hitting empty.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, I was right. But had I had the new ``smart gauge''
on the Dodge/Plymouth Neon, I would have known exactly how much
fuel was left, and breathed easier for those last 15 miles. The
gauge continuously reads the fuel-tank float level every six
seconds, comparing it with stored historical data to calculate a
``real-time'' reading for the gauge to give a more accurate reading
of the fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
   The smart gauge is among the many high-tech features consumers
will be finding on latest model cars and trucks this year. For the
most part, convenience and safety are their selling points.
</P>
<P>
   Night Vision, a system that utilizes ``Heads Up Display'' and
infrared technology _ similar to that used in the Persian Gulf War
_ is being offered on the Cadillac DeVille to improve driver
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Night Vision technology illuminates potential safety hazards out
of range of a car's headlights. The Heads Up Display, or HUD, then
projects the image low on the windshield and allows drivers to see
three to five times farther ahead of their low-beam headlights. The
system also helps reduce the glare of oncoming headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, along with convenience and safety, some drivers _ and
passengers _ want comfort. And in a frigid New England winter, that
can mean heated seats.
</P>
<P>
   First there were heated front seats, now some manufacturs also
provide heat for the rear seats. There are seats that will massage,
and of course, many seats offer lumbar supports. Saab last year
even introduced ventilated seats for those hot sticky days _
combined with a heat pad for those cold days.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there is the climate-controled seat found as an option on
Lincoln's Navigator. The seat has a fan that directs ambient air to
two ceramic thermoelectric devices located in the seat's back and
cushions, which then release or absorb heat, depending on the flow
of electric current to them. The warm _ or cool _ air is then
directed through perforations in the seat upholstery. To complete
the package, there are five different heating and cooling settings.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors is putting its OnStar communications system into
all its models. The system, which is tied into a cell phone, is
designed to automatically call for help in the event of an accident
and air bag deployment and also provides the location of the
disabled vehicle. Saab is also offering the system as an $895
option, which includes three months free service. The system also
allows subscribers to call for help on directions, finding hotels
or restaurants, and other information.
</P>
<P>
   Other nice touches to check out: the Nissan Xterra comes with a
self-draining storage bin on the roof to stow things like muddy
hiking boots. It also has lots of other neat storage ideas, even an
inside bike rack. The Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable have trunk
hooks to hang those plastic grocery bags _ no more loose cans
rolling around the trunk. The Pontiac Bonneville SSEi offers an
emergency package with rain suit, first-aid kit, gloves, light, and
an air hose to pump air into low tires.
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems are getting smarter and easier to use, and
are moving into more vehicles. The Honda Odyssey is the first
minivan to offer a navigation system, as a $2,000 option.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's new Seville offers a radio that gets e-mail, stock
quotes, as well as the latest weather and traffic updates. This
radio goes beyond just providing the information. If a traffic
alert is announced, the radio broadcasts it even if the CD or tape
is playing, and if you don't know where to find traffic infomation,
the radio will do it at the touch of a button.
</P>
<P>
   Many manufacturers of pricy vehicles are now including all-speed
traction control as well as a stabilization system that senses
where the car is going and automatically adjusts brakes to keep the
car on the intended course.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac, which features the Northstar system that includes a
dual overhead cam V-8 engine, stability control system, variable
road-sensing suspension, all speed traction, antilocking brakes and
speed-sensitive steering, has made a major change in its 2000
Seville that should make owners a lot happier. The Northstar engine
has not only been improved but its compression has been lowered so
that it can now drive on regular gasoline instead of 93 octane.
Even Cadillac owners know the value of saving 20 to 30 cents a
gallon.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz, which has been in the forefront of just about
every major automotive safety innovation, is adding the world's
only active suspenision system to its list of firsts. The system,
called ABC (for Active Body Control) virtually eliminates body roll
in cornering, accelerating, and braking. Mercedes says the system
``solves the age-old tradoff between ride comfort, handling
precision and driving safety. The new flagship CL coupe has the
sumptuous ride comfort of an S-Class sedan, while the coupe's crisp
handling surpasses most high-performance cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who thought the Audi A-6 was a bit underpowered should
take another look. Audi is offering a DOHC 30-valve V-6 in its new
S4 and A6 2.7T models. The twin intercoolers and KKK K03
turbochargers blow up to 16 psi of boost increasing horsepower by
50 to 250 at 5800 rpm. Audi has also lowered the compression ratio
and reduced the bore to make the engine quieter and the cylinder
walls of the aluminum block more durable.
</P>
<P>
   The new Saturn LS has two engine options: A V-6 that comes from
Opel in Germany, similar to the one used in Saabs and the Cadillac
Catera, and a new four-cylinder aluminum 137 horsepower engine,
which is designed for less vibration and noise.
</P>
<P>
   When do you need service? Mercedes-Benz vehicles will tell you.
The vehicles are equipped with a Flexible Service System that
monitors oil quality allowing for service intervals of up to 20,000
miles, if oil quality is poor, a system prompts the driver for
earlier service.
</P>
<P>
   What's a sports model with just an automatic transmission? The
sporty Oldsmobile Alero has a five-speed Getrag F23 manual
transmission built in Italy. Unfortunately, it is available only on
four-cylinder models. In the future, it will be offered on the
Pontiac Grand Am and Sunfire and the Chevrolet Cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   All 2000 Mercedes-Benz passenger vehicles (except the SLK
roadster, where it is an option) now come with a driver-adaptive
five-speed automatic transmission as standard equipment. The
five-forward gears are computer controled, networking with the
engine and chassis management systems to adapt to a wide variety of
driving situations, and even to the driver's style.

<TEXT>
<P>
   These may be the best of times for buyers of automobiles, both
aficiandos and those just looking for solid transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Never before have so many manufacturers built so many good,
reliable autos. The worst car at this year's shows is probably a
safer, more reliable car than most of the best built 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Never has there been such a range of choice, from the smallest,
least expensive to the pricey, gargantuan SUVs. Sports coupes and
sports sedans. Trucks that are SUVs and SUVs that are nearly cars.
Cars that talk to you as they guide you on your journey; cars that
you can talk to _ tell them to place a phone call or boost the
radio volume _ and they will respond. Cars that protect you
immensely in driving _ with ABS brakes and driver-assist antispin
features. (These new safety features also mean we have to rethink
the way we teach driving to young people; those of us who have been
driving for some time will also have to learn new techniques. There
are, doubtless, folks reading this piece who don't know, for
instance, that you don't pump ABS brakes when you want to come to a
quick stop.)
</P>
<P>
   And finally, never before has there been such a dichotomy in
design and manufacture _ the auto industry's challenge. Everyone is
trying to build the Swiss Army Knife of cars/SUVs/trucks. All
buyers need do is pick out the blades and appliances they want.
</P>
<P>
   Spend $88,000 on an Acura NSX if you want speed and have the
money. Spend in the $10,000 range for a Toyota Echo or a new Ford
Focus.
</P>
<P>
   The car companies are designing for all of us, young and old,
sporty and sedate. How do you build cars that suit a physically
aging baby boom generation? Cars that suit the already elderly?
Cars that suit a young generation that has grown up with computer
joysticks in hand and expects computer-quickness in its cars? Cars
that suit families? Autos for parents who want to haul their kids,
fetch their own lumber for weekend projects, and go out for dinner
on Saturday night in sedan-whisper quiet _ all in the same auto.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible and these are times of great possibility.
</P>
<P>
   --Do you want the Ford Excursion _ biggest yet of the SUVs and
labeled the ``Ford Valdez'' by environmental critics _ or do you
want the Honda Insight or Toyota Prius _ small hybrids, running on
gasoline and batteries and getting upwards of 60 and 80 miles per
gallon?
</P>
<P>
   --Do you want a sports coupe _ say the snappy Honda S2000, with
its red line at nine grand _ or a sports sedan, seating 5, and
snappy in its own way, like the Acura 3.2 TL or the Nissan Maxima
with a 222 horsepower engine?
</P>
<P>
   --Do you want an SUV or a pickup truck? Or how about a pickup
truck with four doors that seats six and has that one thing the SUV
does not have _ a bed in the back?
</P>
<P>
   --Do you want economical _ $10,000 to $18,000 being economical
these days _ or do you want more luxury. Luxury itself has been
split into many levels _ low-luxury starting at around $20,000 (the
Maxima comes to mind again); mid-luxury starting around $30,000; or
upper luxury at $50,000 and upwards. It can be confusing because
there are $23,000 cars out there that are in many ways as good as
some being sold for much more.
</P>
<P>
   --And how will you shop? Go tussle with a salesman? Go on line?
However you do it, you can go in armed with more knowledge than
ever before, thanks to myriad Web sites that rate autos and tell
you how much you should pay for them _ and how much you should get
for the one you are turning in. (An estimated 2.8 million people
researched new and used car purchases before putting down any money
in 1999.)
</P>
<P>
   For the 1999 model year, 16.8 million new autos were sold, the
most ever, topping by 1.2 million the previous high, set in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   We are buying cleaner, safer, more powerful cars. Cars that come
with more and more ``luxury'' items as standard equipment: power
windows, tilting and telescoping steering wheels, power door locks,
power mirrors (heated, yet).
</P>
<P>
   The new Jaguar S Type has an option that lets you control
climate and radio by voice command. How long before this is a
standard safety feature _ no more distractions while fiddling for
the right knob, the right button or dial?
</P>
<P>
   Navigation systems, still optional, are leapfrogging each other
in content. The new Acura 3.5 RL has a navigation system that has
added millions of ``points of interest'' in just one year of
evolution. While we are still dependent on satellites _ and
therefore, the military's slight fudging of signals for national
security reasons _ a new land-based navigation system is being
developed. It will place 300-foot towers at 53 sites around the
country on old Air Force property.
</P>
<P>
   Choices will continue to unfold as automakers scramble.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch, in a report entitled ``The Automotive Battlefield
2000-2003'' gives us a peek at what is to come.
</P>
<P>
   --Seventy-five percent of the models sold in 1998 will be
replaced by new models in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   --Truck bodies built on car platforms will become more
prominent, with 28 new or next generation models expected over four
years.
</P>
<P>
   --The lifecycles of new models will continue to compress,
dropping to 2.5 years by 2003 as opposed to 3.2 years from 1996 to
1999.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a market of niches and the manufacturers' use of
shared platforms _ as in putting light truck bodies on car
platforms _ will help to fill many of them.
</P>
<P>
   We now have shared platforms appearing on the Toyota Camry and
the Toyota Sienna van; the New Beetle from VW and the Audi TT; the
Plymouth Neon and Chrysler PT Cruiser; the Ford Excursion and Ford
F-Series pickup; and when Ford brings back the Thunderbird, it will
share its platform with the Jaguar S-Type.
</P>
<P>
   Some things to watch for:
</P>
<P>
   --A shakeout in the luxury market as buyers weight bucks against
bang. Volvo is out with a sedan and wagon in the low 20s; Mercury's
Sable offers better steering, suspension and transmission than in
the past and more oomph from a 3.0 liter V-6 engine. The $20,000 to
$40,000 price range is a goldmine for discerning shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   --Station wagons are making a comeback. Volvo added the small
V40 to its lineup; Saab now has a wagon; BMW will send its 3 Series
wagon here.
</P>
<P>
   --Aging baby boomers could go in one of two directions _ snappy
sports sedans or laid-back luxury.
</P>
<P>
   For those who feel the need for speed, sports sedans to watch
include the Acura 3.2 TL, the Pontiac Bonneville SSEi, Chrysler's
300M, the Nissan Maxima, the Lincoln LS, the Lexus ES 300, the I30
Infiniti and Chevrolet's Monte Carlo SS _ a luxury sedan with hot
damn good ol' boy written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   For boomers feeling a bit grayer and ready to slow down, Toyota
has turned the Avalon into their type of car _ kicked back, less
sporty, quiet, smooth and dependable. Same for the Acura 3.5 RL.
</P>
<P>
   As the boomers age, their children _ the Echo Boomers _ are the
target of the new wave of small, reliable, and inexpensive autos.
The Echo and the Focus join this list, along with the VW Golf, and
Daimler Chrysler says a mini version of the Neon will follow.
</P>
<P>
   For young and old with a few bucks to spend, there are hot new
sports cars: the Honda S2000 (watch for price gouging on this
$30,000 car); the Audi TT in coupe and roadster form; a new M3 from
BMW to go with the Z3 and M Coupe; and at lesser prices the
Mitsubishi Eclipse 2(plus)2, the Toyota Celica GT-S, and Toyota's
MR Spyder, a high perofrmance, mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive
roadster.
</P>
<P>
   On the truck and SUV front, cross-pollination is the order of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   SUVs continue to get carlike: the Lexus RX300 sitting on a
Toyota Camry sedan chassis; Mercedes and BMW are coming out with
SUVs, developed on race tracks, which reach speeds up to 155 mph.
And look for an Acura SUV to be introduced in Detroit this winter.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks get ever more SUV-like: four doors, smoother,
quieter rides, seating for up to six. Chevrolet, Toyota, and Nissan
are heavy into this market this year. Ford has been there, watching
its F-Series sales of four-door pickup trucks climb from around 10
percent of its total pickup truck sales just three years ago to
more than 80 percent of its anticipated total pickup trucks sales
in the upcoming model year.
</P>
<P>
   Toss in minivans _ a slowed market compared to past years but a
solid one nonetheless (Mazda is counting on a small, front-wheel
drive van to help boost its sales) _ and the permutations of metal
and power in which you can wrap yourself are endless.
</P>
<P>
   And this as (again, no ``M'' word here) our full first century
of auto production closes and a bolder century full of
technological and innovative possibility looms.

<P>
   The 2000 model year promises to be a good year for consumers in
the market for a new set of wheels. The millennium models are
coming better equipped, without higher price tags. There is also a
new competitiveness. Ford is aiming to win back the sales crown
from Toyota with a revamped Taurus, for example. And both Ford and
Toyota are hoping to muscle their way into the small car field by
introducing brand-new models.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai is also coming on strong in the small car field with a
redesigned Accent. With the company's new emphasis on quality and
great warranties, Hyundai is a make to check out. Nissan's Sentra
will have more power and looks. Nissan also will offer a slightly
more expensive version of the Sentra that features a new catalytic
converter that traps hydrocarbons and hangs onto them until they
can be burned off later by the hotter exhaust of the warmed up car.
The result, Nissan claims, is an exhaust no dirtier than the air we
breathe.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Toyota took the car sales crown, selling 476,752
Camrys compared to Honda's 415,960 Accord sales and 367,582 sales
of the Ford Taurus. Even with those sales, Toyota was still third
on the list of top 10 sellers for 1999. Six of the models on the
list, including the top two, were trucks: No. 1 was the Ford
F-Series with 867,441 sales; next was the Chevrolet C/K pickup at
616,693.
</P>
<P>
   This year Ford is dropping its tear-drop styling for a more
conventional look for the Taurus, which it is packing (ditto
Mercury Sable) with more room, power, and safety. The two model
lines have all-new sheetmetal, more horsepower, all-speed traction
control, optional power pedals, inside trunk release, and front and
side air bags.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Mercury is reporting its models are proving very
popular, especially the New England Edition of the Sable that comes
with a free moon roof and ABS, a $1,400 value. Apparently New
Englanders know a good value when they see it.
</P>
<P>
   Arch rival Chevrolet is also coming on strong with an all-new
Impala and a sporty Monte Carlo. Adding to the punch will be a new
Cavalier, Chevy's hottest selling car.
</P>
<P>
   The new Impala will come in two models, the Impala sedan, which
has a standard V-6, and the LS model, which has the 3800 SFI V6
with 200 horsepower. The roomy Impala also offers ABS, traction
control, tire inflation warning, 16-inch wheels, and dual-control
climate zone. The Monte Carlo coupe, while sharing Impala's
wheelbase and engines, has its own sheetmetal for a more sporty
look.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is taking solid aim at the youth market with its Echo, a
new entry that is bigger all around than its predecessor, the
Tercel. Echo's interior is as roomy as the more expensive Corolla.
What's more, the Echo will start at $10,000, with a well-equipped
model costing around $12,500. For that price, you get air
conditioning, power steering, sport body kit, and a radio with CD
and cassette player. Adding to Echo's appeal is the promise of
peppy performance and gas mileage of 38 to 52 miles per gallon.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Focus is also designed for space and youth. It claims
more head, cargo, and leg room than anything in its class. The
Focus will be available first as a four-door sedan. Later,
three-door coupe and wagon versions will be offered. The Focus will
be powered by a 2-liter engine and have a choice of manual or
automatic transmission. In addition, the Focus will be sold in
customized editions. ``We don't believe in the one-size-fits-all
theory. Young people really define themselves,'' says Julie Roehm,
brand manager. So, look for some special packages for the Focus: a
pet package that includes bed, water bottle, bowl and pockets for
treats; or an ``express yourself'' version with car decals, gear
shift, seat wardrobe and wheel cover. Another option provides a
voice recorder, notepad holder, and work station. The Focus was to
replace the Escort, but Ford plans on selling both models for now.
</P>
<P>
   In the sport utility field, BMW claims its X5 performs and
handles like one of its sedans. Nissan has the Xterra, to appeal to
active young people, and Mercedes-Benz has the ML55 with a
340-horsepower engine that will blast away just about anything on
the road, doing 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than 6 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Ford brings out the biggest SUV of all, the Excursion, to
finally top the GM Suburban, which has held the size title since
1935. (Of course, no one knew what a sport utility vehicle was back
then.) General Motors is countering Ford with a totally redesigned
and more powerful Chevrolet Suburban and GMC Yukon .
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the Chrysler PT Cruiser. Chrysler calls it a truck,
but consumers may have a different opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In the minivan field, Mazda is offering its all-new, front-drive
MPV with innovative seating choices and roll-down sliding door
windows. Chevrolet is dressing up its Venture minivan with a video
system for rear seaters that includes free flicks from Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   BMW introduces a new 3 coupe and has a 3 wagon on the way. The
Pontiac Bonneville is all new with a longer wheelbase, stiffer
ride, and wider track. It's also offered with turbocharged power in
the SSEi model.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan has revamped its Maxima, coming up with 22 additional
horsepower by redesigning the exhaust system, and the Maxima can
now go 100,000-miles before a tune up is required.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti has given the I30 a boost, packing it with new
equipment while holding the price at around $30,000. The car comes
with a 227-horsepower engine, Xenon headlights, an active
front-seat head restraint system, and 200-watt Bose audio system
with seven speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Honda is putting fun back into driving with its newest entry,
the S2000 sports car. A hot performing two seater, this high-tech
roadster will be priced around $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jaguar is moving into the mass market with its new S-Type sedan.
Selling in the mid-$40,000 range, this rear-drive vehicle is sure
to heat up sales. Almost overlooked is another model from Jaguar, a
super-charged 370 horsepower XK8.
</P>
<P>
   Oldsmobile is jumping the gun on 2001 by introducing the all-new
Aurora early in 2000. It is the first redesign since the car
debuted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn is growing in size. This year an L (for large) series
comes in sedan and wagon models alongside the S cars and wagons.
The L models come with a choice of a four-cylinder or a V-6 engine.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best alternatives to sport utility vehicles is a
Subaru. All-wheel drive is featured throughout the line, and this
year the third generation Legacy and Outback are better than ever,
even roomier. Outback, previously just a wagon series, has added a
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   Lincoln, too, has a winner in its new ``entry level'' LS
rear-drive sedan. Built on the same platform as the Jaguar S-Type,
it handles beautifully and is a real performer.
</P>
<P>
   Park Avenue, Buick's full-sized luxury flagship model, is the
first domestic car to offer whiplash protection. It also has GM's
StabiliTrak handling system.
</P>
<P>
   A nameplate from the past is being revived at Saab. Areo, which
has been ranked as a true touring sedan with great performance,
returns in the 9-5 model line, and like its predecessors, it
promises to be a winner with a turbocharged four-cylinder,
230-horsepower engine.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac is redoing its Northstar V-8 to take regular gas
instead of the more expensive 93 octane. Cadillac is also offering
the all-new DeVille, loaded with safety and comfort systems, many
of which are unavailable in any other vehicle. DeVille comes with a
night vision sensing device, STabilTrak, and three-zone climate
control inside.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes-Benz has all-new S430 ($69,700) and S500 ($77,850)
sedans. Both are lighter than previous models, but packed with
performance and safety features. Also arriving are a new CLK 430
Cabriolet with four seats, and for the performance-oriented sport
utility fan, the 340-horsepower ML55 that can do 0 to 60 m.p.h. in
less than 6 seconds. Mercedes also is introducing designer editions
with unique paint and upholstery colors on its roadsters, coupes,
and S-Class and E-Class sedans. What is truly amazing is that
Mercedes is offering vehicles at an almost affordable price _ the
C230 sedan starts at $31,750 with free maintenance for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Alphabetically speaking, Volvo is last, but certainly not least,
in the auto world. For 2000, Volvo has added two nifty compacts,
the S40 sedan and V40 wagon. Starting at around $23,000 these
vehicles are packed with traditional Volvo features.
</P>
<P>
   While there are many car and truck debutes this year, shoppers
shouldn't overlook the other models, that is, the ones that don't
look much different from a '99. Even these vehicles have changes.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus, for example, has no ``all new'' models, but it has done
some upgrading to make the line more attractive. The ES 300, for
example, has an optional Brake Assist safety system that can detect
panic braking and augment the brake pressure applied by the driver.
The feature is now standard on the GS 400/300, LS 400 and LX 470
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Lexus is entering its 10th year of selling in the United States.
In its first year, the company had just two models and sold 63,000
cars. Since then Lexus has changed the face of the luxury market.
This year Lexus offers six models, cars and SUVs, and has become
the No. 1 selling luxury make, outselling all its US and German
competitors.

SAFETY BECOMING STANDARD FARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Safety is taking on new meaning with the 2000 models.
</P>
<P>
   While few will argue that vehicles need features to protect the
driver and passengers, there is some debate about what those
features should be, and how they should work. Air bags, in
particular, have been both hailed for how well they protect, and
criticized for how dangerous they can be to driver and passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Air bags have been proven to prevent serious injuries and death.
However, there have been problems primarily with smaller people who
may be sitting too close to an air bag when it opens, and to
infants placed in the front passenger seat of a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Both these issues have been addressed in many models in the 2000
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Because buyers want a safe environment, car manufacturers are
adding new features, many of them to lower-priced vehicles.
Mercedes-Benz, for example, has long had a lead in introducing
safety features on their more expensive models, but these features
are now showing up on the company's ``entry-level'' vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Antilock brakes, once an expensive option, are now found across
the board as standard equipment or as a fairly low-priced option.
Many safety advocates urge consumers to consider antilock brakes a
necessity rather than an option, however. While it's impressive to
know a car can do 0 to 60 mile per hour in less than 6 seconds, it
is more comforting to know it can do 60 to 0 mph in as few seconds,
and do it without pulling the vehicle into the path of another car.
</P>
<P>
   Answering air bag concerns for short drivers are the
electrically adjustable foot pedals found on Ford, Mercury, and
Lincoln products. These allow the driver to raise the pedals
without having to push the seat too close to the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Mercedes has been offering a child sensing device in the front
passenger seat, that combined with the use of a specially designed
child safety seat, shuts off the air bag on the passenger side.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac's new Seville has sensors that prevent the air bags
from deploying if the seat is occupied by a small child. The system
works with both the front and side air bags. The sensors measure
the weight and posterior of the occupant to distinguish a child
from a lightweight adult. The rear-view mirror contains a light
that indicates if the air bag has been switched off.
</P>
<P>
   Most manufacturers are now offering ``second generation'' or
low-impact airbags to help reduce injury when the bags open. On its
5 and 7 series, BMW uses a dual-system frontal air-bag system that
deploys the bag as gently or as powerfully as needed, depending on
crash severity. Another example of safety technology becoming more
widely available is the BMW 3 series, which is offering rear-side
impact air bags as an option. Until this year, those air bags were
offered only on the BMW 5 and 7 series.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mercedes and Volvos have curtain-type bags that help
protect heads and necks in side-impact crashes as well.
</P>
<P>
   Whiplash is a major concern in accidents. Mercedes-Benz, Volvo,
and Saab all offer systems to prevent whiplash, and this year Buick
becomes the first domestic car to offer a whiplash-prevention
system. Similar to the Saab's system, the Buick system, refereed to
as a ``Catcher's Mitt,'' begins with special backing inside the
seat. On impact, as the body is forced into the seat back, the head
restraint is activated, rising up and out to reach the occupant's
head, reducing the head's motion and, hopefully, neck, back, and
spine injuries. Ultimately, the seat absorbs the body's energy as
it's forced backwards into the seat and helps keep the passenger's
pelvis and lower back in proper alignment. The head rest is
designed to automatically fall back and reset in place.
</P>
<P>
   Warning drivers behind you of an impending stop can also aid in
preventing accidents. The Cadillac DeVille is the first vehicle
with LED taillights. LEDs can illuminate in 0.1 millisecond vs. the
200 milliseconds of incandescent bulbs. That translates into an
additional 17.6 feet of warning for drivers behind the Cadillac
DeVille.
</P>
<P>
   The DeVille also features a Night Vision system that can ``see''
three to five times farther ahead than the low-beam headlights
reveal. Any object, i.e. potential safety hazard, is projected onto
the lower part of the windshield. The system also helps reduce the
glare of oncoming vehicles' headlights.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is the first automaker to include an emergency trunk
release as standard equipment for its passenger cars. Last year, 11
children died after being trapped inside car trunks. General Motors
and other manufactures will also soon be offering the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford Windstar minivan, and now the Cadillac DeVille and
other makes offer warning systems when backing up. The systems
sound an alarm as an object gets closer. Mercedes goes a step
farther with its S class system that automatically slows the
vehicle down if it gets too close to another.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dangers of driving an SUV is that in a collision with
a car, the car could submarine beneath the SUV. Among SUVs,
Mercedes has bumpers placed low enough to prevent this. For the
Ford Excursion _ the biggest SUV of all _ a bumper-like
``BlockerBeam'' crossmember (a lower bumper) is located at the
front of the vehicle 2.5 inches below and 6.5 inches behind the
main bumper. The beam is designed to engage the frame rails of a
car in the event of a collision, preventing the Excursion from
riding up and over the car. The Excursion has a similar system in
the rear that also serves as a mount for the trailer hitch.
</P>
<P>
   While many feel an all-wheel-drive system is a plus when it
comes to safety when the roads are wet or covered with snow, you
don't have to buy a big sport utility vehicle to have it. Subaru
uses all-wheel-drive throughout its lineup, and others, such as
Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Volkswagen, Audi, and DaimlerChrysler offer
it on selected cars, station wagons, and minivans. This year,
Subaru is adding daytime running lights as standard equipment. BMW
offers drivers a choice of running with daytime lights on or off.

HYBRIDS MAKE A POWER PLAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1997 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How would you like to have a car that sells for less than
$20,000 and promises up to 70 miles a gallon?
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed gas-guzzling SUVs were taking over the
highways, two automakers are ready to unveil economic and
environmental alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   These are not electric-powered vehicles that can't be driven too
far without getting all charged up, or might have problems starting
in cold weather. These so-called hybrid vehicles will be very much
like the cars most of us are driving now, equipped with antilock
brakes; airbags, front and side; power windows, and more.
</P>
<P>
   Having driven the Toyota Prius along Boston streets and
highways, I can vouch for its handling, room, and responsive power.
The Prius and its counterpart Honda hybrid, the Insight, use both
gasoline and electric engines for power.
</P>
<P>
   When pulling away from a stop or under a light load, only the
electric motor kicks in. Under normal driving conditions, power
from the gasoline engine is divided between the wheels and the
electric generator. During deceleration or braking, the motor
functions as a generator to recharge the batteries. Thus, the
batteries never need to be recharged from an external source.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the system is a power-split transmission that sends
engine power either directly to the wheels or to the generator
controling the electric motor or battery state-of-charge. The
power-split device uses a planetary gear to constantly vary the
amount of power supplied from the engine to either the wheels or
generator. And, it's all done seamlessly.
</P>
<P>
   When driving the Pirus, I couldn't tell whether the vehicle was
on gas or electric power. The only clue is on a 5.8-inch wide
multi-function monitor that shows the condition and energy flow of
the hybrid drive system. (It can also serve for a navigation
system.)
</P>
<P>
   To help boost system efficiency, Prius is fitted with a
regenerative braking system. If the vehicle is coasting or the
brakes are applied, the motor is turned into a generator, capturing
energy that would normally be lost as heat or kinetic energy and
transforming it into electricity to recharge the battery.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota says the Prius cuts nitrous oxide and carbon monoxide
emissions by 90 percent and hydrocarbons from 75 to 90 percent
beyond current stringent standards.
</P>
<P>
   While we only tested an early Japanese right-hand drive model,
the four-door sedan was quite comfortable and roomy with plenty of
room for four, maybe five. The trunk seemed a bit small, but this
vehicle is really designed for city use, although it appears it can
do quite nicely on the open highway. Toyota styled the car in its
California studios.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota has been marketing the car in Japan since December 1997
and has had phenomenal success, selling more than 27,000 models.
When the Prius arrives in America in mid-2000, Toyota is setting an
initial volume of 1,000 units a month for its dealerships in the 49
continental states. It is expected to sell for around $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's hybrid, the Insight, will beat Toyota to the showrooms,
arriving sometime in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Insight will be a two-door with a two-plus-two seating
configuration. It will be powered by a 1.0-liter, 65 horsepower,
3-cylinder VTEC gas engine supplemented by an electric motor. Like
the Toyota, the battery pack is recharged by both the gas engine's
power and regenerating power when the car's brakes are applied.
</P>
<P>
   A lightweight aluminum frame and plastic fenders fore and aft
keep the Insight's weight below 2,000 pounds to aid economy.
Standard safety items include driver and passenger side airbags,
antilock brakes, power windows, and locks along with remote keyless
entry.
</P>
<P>
   The American version of the Prius will be similar to the
Japanese version but some specifications and design touches are
expected to change. Actual specifications will be announced shortly
before it is introduced here.

   Deciding what kind of vehicle to acquire is tough enough, but
figuring out how to obtain you next vehicle can be even tougher. In
the end, no matter how lofty your dreams _ and how enticing those
ads with the unbelievably low monthly payments may be _ the
dollars-and-cents facts should bring you back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   With the median price of a vehicle hovering around $20,000, a
lot of consumers are turned off by some of the new high-tech
vehicles that are nice but out of reach. Which is why Toyota and
Ford are introducing low-priced models packed with big value. The
Ford Focus and Toyota Echo are aimed at young people who don't have
the big bucks to buy the big cars, yet both vehicles are big on the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Even the higher-priced lines are coming out with lower-priced
but value-packed models. Volvo has the S40 and V40 starting at
$23,000; Lincoln has the sporty and high-performance L series,
starting in the low 30s; Mercedes has added even more features to
its ``entry level'' C230 which starts around $31,000.
</P>
<P>
   And you don't have to look hard to get great performance and
safety, once only found in expensive models. The new Ford Taurus/
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Sable is packed with safety features, even receiving a
five-star rating from the National Safety Board. Volkswagen is
another great safety and performance value. Even young royals
appreciate VW. Prince William reportedly learned to drive on a Ford
Focus, but purchased a VW Passat. (Well, VW does own a bit of
British heritage in Bentley and for a while Rolls-Royce.)
</P>
<P>
   The secret to getting the most for your money in any new _ or
used _ vehicle is doing your homework. First do some comparison
shopping, looking at prices and models that appeal. Do a test
drive, not just around the block, but under conditions similar to
your normal driving experience _ on the highway, on rough roads,
checking out the vehicle's pickup. Do this with similar models _
there are performance and handling difference even between models
of the same make vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Check up on the reliability of the vehicle you are considering.
One of the best sources for such information is last April's
Consumer Reports annual auto issue. Sure, you're looking at reports
on '99s, but most 2000 models have few changes, especially
mechanical.
</P>
<P>
   Then do some pricing. First, decide on the make and model
vehicle you want. Note the sticker price with all the options you
desire. That's not the final price, just a basis to work from.
Next, find out what the vehicle cost the dealer, and what your
trade-in is worth. There are many sources for this information: one
of the most reliable is Consumer Reports, which for $12 will fax a
report with the invoice price, the sticker price, option prices,
equipment recommendations, rebates, dealer incentives, and advice
on how to negotiate. Information on your trade-in vehicle is an
additional $10. Leasing advice is also offered. To obtain the
reports call 800-933-5555.
</P>
<P>
   Especially useful is the information on rebates and incentives
since many are unadvertised. For example, Mercury is discontinuing
the Contour and is offering incentives of $1,500 to move them out.
Even many 2000 models have unadvertised incentives from
manufacturers. For example, the Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Cirrus
have customer incentives of $1,250 through Dec. 13; the Buick Park
Avenue has a $1,000 incentive on 2000 models, and a $3,000
incentive on '99s.
</P>
<P>
   From here you can bargain. Consumers Reports suggests offering 4
to 8 percent more than the invoice price on popular models. And
hold off mentioning any trade-in until a price is agreed on, this
way you'll really know what the dealer is offering for your old
car. If the vehicle you are buying is in demand, you'll probably
have to forget all this and pay the asking or sticker price. Last
year, a friend wanted a Mercedes M430 sport utility, a very desired
make and in limited production. She not only had to pay the sticker
price, but was offered the lowest wholesale price on her trade-in,
a Saab. She swallowed the sticker price, but sold her Saab in a
private deal.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't like bartering, there are buying services, which
will do the work for you. They can be found in the Yellow Pages of
the phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Homework is also important if you are considering a leased
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Leasing can be very attractive, especially when you compare the
monthly lease payments to what you may pay on a car loan. Then
there is the matter of the down payment. For sure, you will need a
hefty one if you buy, while many leases don't require much up-front
money.
</P>
<P>
   To help you decide if leasing is for you, consider how long you
intend to have the vehicle, and how many miles you are likely to
drive during that time. Most leases are 36 to 60 months. And most
leases, especially those with attractive payments, limit your
driving to 12,000 to 15,000 miles a year. Drive more than that and
you can be hit with some hefty mileage charges _ 10 to 15 cents a
mile times a few thousand miles can be costly. Leases can be
written for higher mileage, but at a higher price.
</P>
<P>
   All leases are based on the ``residual'' value _ what the bank
thinks your car or truck will be worth _ of the vehicle at the end
of the lease. You pay only for usage. Remember, you don't own the
vehicle, and the holder of the lease will want that car or truck
back in good condition.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports indicate that leasing has dropped a bit in
popularity. One reason is that manufacturers have cut back on
subsidizing leases, especially after making some wrong guesses as
to what the vehicles would be worth at the end of the lease and
losing money on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Many people are now looking to the Internet to buy or lease. The
Internet is a great way to research various makes. Autosite.com,
for example, can help you decide between two makes with its easy to
use side-by-side comparison feature.
</P>
<P>
   For many consumer, one of the best features of shopping on the
Internet is the impersonal nature of it. No face-to-face
bargaining. You might even feel better making an offer on the Web.
One dealer says he prices his vehicles on the Internet as much as
$2,500 less than on his lot. Why? Because Internet users are
looking for low prices. To complete the sale, though, you'll still
have to go into the showroom.
</P>
<P>
   But whether you go kick tires, or use your mouse to find a new
vehicle, you need to know what's out there, what your dream is
really worth, and what your present set of wheels are worth. And,
keep in mind no matter what car or truck you settle on, it will
need service even if it does promise 100,000 miles between
tune-ups. Check out the warranty on the vehicle, and the dealer's
service department. That good deal from the sales department may
not be such a good deal after all if the mechanics and technicians
can't deliver.

TRUCKS THAT ARE LIKE CARS THAT ARE LIKE MINIVANS . . .

<P>
   There was a time when a truck was, well, a truck. It was used
for hauling construction equipment, moving furniture, picking up
sheets of plywood.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks are still used for those purposes, but today's trucks are
more carlike, even becoming the vehicle of choice for everyday
transportation. And with this evolution, comes some interesting
hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the Chrysler PT Cruiser. Is it a truck, minivan, or
car? DaimlerChrysler says it's a truck. This novel looking
Neon-based vehicle looks like anything but a truck. No matter,
DaimlerChrysler says it is a truck; some say DaimlerChrysler is
giving it that label because federal fuel-economy standards for
trucks are less stringent than for cars.
</P>
<P>
   For those who still like their trucks to look like trucks, there
also is a wide variety of offerings.
</P>
<P>
   One of this year's more interesting trucks is the ``family
styled'' Nissan Frontier with a large cab with four regular doors
and a short bed. The bed is too short to carry a 4-by-8 foot sheet
of plywood, but Nissan has a nice touch for when you do want to lug
something, maybe not that long, but longer than the bed allows.
It's called a bed extender and it can swing out and rest on the
tailgate allowing longer loads to be carried with ease. The
Frontier Crew Cab can also be equipped with a tubular-style
heavy-duty roof rack that can be fitted with attachments to carry
everything from skis to mountain bikes allowing you to stack up the
truck bed with the rest of your gera.
</P>
<P>
   Other small trucks include the Chevrolet S pickup, Dodge Dakota,
Ford Ranger, GMC Sonoma, Isuzu Hombre, Mazda B series, and Toyota
Tacoma.
</P>
<P>
   In the full-sized truck category, the Chevrolet Silverado and
GMC Sierra now have four doors available on the cabs.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota, which last year entered the full-sized truck arena with
the Tundra, is adding a four-door version to its lineup as well.
New for the Dodge Dakota is a four-door Quad Cab version that will
seat up to six people. The cab features full-sized, front-hinged
rear doors with full roll-down windows. Adding to its hauling
capacity, the pickup box can carry a 1,450-pound payload. Dodge is
also offering lots of engine choices: a standard 175-horsepower V-6
Magnum, or optional V-8s, one with 235 horsepower, the other at 245
horsepower. A new four-speed automatic transmission with dual-ratio
second gear is also an option. Three drive trains are offered: two
wheel, part-time four wheel, or full-time four-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Other full-sized truck makes include the Dodge Ram, Ford F
Series, and Ford Super Duty. Four doors are now found on all.

   I slip into the driver's seat of my latest test car, snap on the
seatbelt and turn the ignition.
</P>
<P>
   The seatback comes up and forward, pushing my chest to the
steering wheel. The front of the seat rises, crunching my thighs.
And then the whole seat moves forward, amplifying all the crunching
and pushing that is going on. It's one of those automatic
driver-memory seats and the driver it is remembering certainly was
not built like me.
</P>
<P>
   Such is life when you slip behind the wheel of a new car every
week.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, one of the questions I am most frequently asked by
those curious about my job, which is testing cars and writing about
them, is how long it takes to get used to the vagaries,
idiosyncracies, and basic operation of each car.
</P>
<P>
   It can be a demanding enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   I reach to the left of the steering column for the turn signal.
Finding the stem, I click it down. Suddenly, the car surges ahead,
picking up speed on its own. Baffled, I look down. I have hit the
resume mode for cruise control. I find the turn signal stem
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   I am driving as the sun goes down and I turn on the headlights,
turning the controls clockwise as far as they will go. I drive on,
thinking the blue glow of these high-tech European headlights is
less illuminating than I would have expected. Soon, approaching
drivers are flicking their headlights at me. Do I have my brights
on? I click the dimmer switch. Nothing. I pull over, turn on the
interior lights and discover one of those idiosyncracies. On this
car, you can turn right past the headlights ``on'' position to
another where all you have lit up are side parking lights.
</P>
<P>
   These are funky variations. Others are more serious.
</P>
<P>
   On some cars, a steady pressure on the brake pedal will bring
you to a gradual, sure stop. On others, touch the brake pedal and
you are thrust against the seatbelt.
</P>
<P>
   Move from a week in a high-powered front-wheel drive car,
hellbent on torque steering you off the chosen line, and move into
a high-powered rear-wheel drive car and it takes some time behind
the wheel to stop watching out for torque steer and instead
watching for the moment the rear wheels try to break away.
</P>
<P>
   And there are wonderful, light-hearted moments that have found
me chuckling to myself as I explored _ on-the-job-training _ the
intricacies of dashboards and their knobs and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   I have reached out, mind still set on the previous car and not
the one I am driving that moment, and hit the button for more heat.
The radio responded by going up so loud it set my eardrums to
ringing.
</P>
<P>
   I have pulled up to toll booths, hit the button to lower my
window, and set off my emergency flashers _ all the better to
attract attention to this lout who is now holding up the toll line
as he searches the car for the window buttons.
</P>
<P>
   I have missed important moments in Red Sox games, rolling into
the broad reaches of New England where Boston stations fade out and
I need to find a local broadcast of the game, all because I could
not figure out how to tune the radio.
</P>
<P>
   I fairly toasted a daughter on a hot summer day _ ``Ah, dad.
Why's this seat so hot?'' _ when I hit the seat heating button,
thinking I was turning up the fan. This same daughter has a radar
for the hidden cupholders I can never seem to find on my own.
</P>
<P>
   I have opened sunroofs in the rain, rolled down back windows by
mistake, popped a trunk lid trying to automatically lock the doors,
and spent embarassing minutes at gas pumps trying to figure out how
to open the lid covering the gas cap.
</P>
<P>
   Each car is a new adventure wrapped in a puzzle. The puzzle
always gets solved, but sometimes it takes a while. But it is what
is great about driving a new car each week. Something to learn
every time.
</P>
<P>
   Another daughter once showed me how cars and culture can at
times be at odds.
</P>
<P>
   One rule on these test cars is that no one is supposed to smoke
in them _ but occasionally a prior occupant has done just that.
</P>
<P>
   That is how it happened that this daughter _ in an age when
smoking is dying as fast as smokers _ opened the ashtray in the
dash, saw that it was filled with cigarette butts and uttered,
``Gross, Dad. Somebody put cigarette butts in the coin thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many of the moments of searching and uncertainty I
experience are self-inflicted. I could, afterall, read the
instruction booklets thoroughly before hitting the road.
</P>
<P>
   But I am a man. And that would be like asking for directions.

<P>
   The house in France that I live in was built in the 16th
century, and though I doubt any of the windowpanes are original,
some of them are quite old. People go all wavy as they pass my
office. Those vertical distortions in the panes remind me that
glass _ brittle, breakable glass _ is really a fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that glass is a fluid is a very widespread myth,''
says Yvonne Stokes, a mathematician at the University of Adelaide
in Australia. ``I was told it as a fact by my adviser. And once, a
class of schoolchildren came into the lab, and one of them told me
the very same thing. If you want to talk microscopically, then you
can call glass a fluid. But people understandably tend to think
that if it's a fluid, it flows. It's that notion that's false.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes has recently proved with detailed calculations that old
windows could not have flowed perceptibly.
</P>
<P>
   If the myth survives, it will be because it contains a kernel of
truth _ and because glass is a confusing kind of matter, quite
unlike the three ordinary kinds.
</P>
<P>
   A gas is an anarchy of molecules going every which way; a liquid
is a tighter but still disorderly society in which molecules
constantly dissolve and re-establish weak bonds; a solid is a
molecular army in rigid formation.
</P>
<P>
   But glass is ... none of the above. It is rigid like a solid,
but its molecules are not arranged in repeating crystals. It is
amorphous like a liquid.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, structurally there is no sharp line between a liquid
and a glass. You form glass by ``supercooling'' a liquid below its
freezing point, then cooling it some more. If you cool it fast
enough, the molecules can't organize themselves into crystals. As
the temperature drops, the liquid becomes more viscous and the
molecules more sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Window glass is made mostly of sand _ with soda ash mixed in to
lower melting temperature and limestone to decrease solubility in
its final form _ but just about any liquid can be a glass if it is
cooled quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Some liquids are easier to turn into glass than others, however.
The more viscous a liquid is at its freezing point, the more
trouble the molecules will have moving into crystalline formation,
and the more likely they are to end up a glass instead.
</P>
<P>
   Glasses are everywhere these days _ and yet researchers are
still arguing about their very nature. Is a glass simply a liquid
in solid clothing? Or, as chemical engineer Pablo Debenedetti of
Princeton University puts it, is the glass around us really a
``masked version of something more profound,'' something called an
ideal glass?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called ideal because no one has seen it,'' Debenedetti
says. But as a theoretical concept it might explain some of the
properties of real glass.
</P>
<P>
   Debenedetti says real glass is puzzling because both the
temperature at which it forms and its final properties depend on
the rate at which the liquid is cooled: ``In order to tell you that
water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit or that it freezes at 32
degrees, I don't need to specify anything about the velocity of
heating or cooling. But the glass transition is different.''
</P>
<P>
   The slower you cool the melt, the lower the temperature at which
it will change into glass, and the more dense that glass will be.
So windowglass forms at anywhere between 1,472 and 1,022 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass, some theorists believe, is what you would
produce if you could cool a liquid with geologic slowness while
somehow preventing it from crystalizing. It would form at one
precise temperature, just as solids, liquids and gases do. Like
them, it would be a distinct phase of matter, and not merely _ like
ordinary glass _ a solid/liquid hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass would be as motionless and nearly as orderly as a
crystal, but it would not be a crystal. No one knows what it would
look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking me to engage in poetry,'' says Frank Stillinger
of Bell Labs. ``It's like saying, `What color is the hair of angels
dancing on the head of a pin?' I can't answer that question
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its structure, an ideal glass would be in equilibrium,
just like the other phases of matter _ but unlike real glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A glass is constantly evolving, trying to get to
equilibrium,'' Ediger says. ``A crystal is happy just to sit there,
because it's already at the bottom of an energy valley. A glass is
sitting on the side of a hill. And very, very slowly it does roll
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the fat kernel of truth inside the myth: Glass really
does flow_ just not on a human timescale. If you could somehow
preserve a cathedral window for long enough, it might become a
rigid puddle on the floor. Or it might become an opaque crystalline
solid. Conceivably, that church window might even evolve into an
ideal glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do the experiment for long enough,'' Ediger says.
``But it's a very interesting question.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Stokes has calculated how long would be long enough.
Assuming a windowpane simply flows downhill, she asked, how long
would it take for the bottom to get just 5 percent thicker?
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 million years, she figures _ and that is likely to
be a ``big underestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral windows may be thicker at the bottom, she says, simply
because handmade glass varies in thickness, and medieval builders
chose to put the thick ends down. And wavy old windowpanes are not
glass that has flowed; they're glass that was flawed from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most windows are made of flawless ``float glass'':
Molten glass is poured onto a bath of molten tin and allowed to
spread out and solidify into a perfectly flat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   But at Blenko Glass in Milton, W. Va., they still make
windowpanes the old-fashioned way. The artisan gets a ball of
molten glass on the end of his pipe, which he blows into a long,
cylindrical wooden mold so the malleable glass forms a hollow tube
inside.
</P>
<P>
   After the glass cools, he removes it from the mold, scores it
lengthwise, reheats the glass and irons it into a single
18-by-25-inch pane. Each one contains air bubbles and large wavy
bands and sells for $27, because some people like the aesthetics of
old glass _ people in charge of historical landmarks, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, recalls Blenko's Lewis Powers, the company got
a large order for replacement panes from the White House: ``They
wanted the wavy look.''

just like the other phases of matter _ but unlike real glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A glass is constantly evolving, trying to get to
equilibrium,'' Ediger says. ``A crystal is happy just to sit there,
because it's already at the bottom of an energy valley. A glass is
sitting on the side of a hill. And very, very slowly it does roll
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the fat kernel of truth inside the myth: Glass really
does flow_ just not on a human timescale. If you could somehow
preserve a cathedral window for long enough, it might become a
rigid puddle on the floor. Or it might become an opaque crystalline
solid. Conceivably, that church window might even evolve into an
ideal glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do the experiment for long enough,'' Ediger says.
``But it's a very interesting question.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Stokes has calculated how long would be long enough.
Assuming a windowpane simply flows downhill, she asked, how long
would it take for the bottom to get just 5 percent thicker?
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 million years, she figures _ and that is likely to
be a ``big underestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral windows may be thicker at the bottom, she says, simply
because handmade glass varies in thickness, and medieval builders
chose to put the thick ends down. And wavy old windowpanes are not
glass that has flowed; they're glass that was flawed from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most windows are made of flawless ``float glass'':
Molten glass is poured onto a bath of molten tin and allowed to
spread out and solidify into a perfectly flat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   But at Blenko Glass in Milton, W. Va., they still make
windowpanes the old-fashioned way. The artisan gets a ball of
molten glass on the end of his pipe, which he blows into a long,
cylindrical wooden mold so the malleable glass forms a hollow tube
inside.
</P>
<P>
   After the glass cools, he removes it from the mold, scores it
lengthwise, reheats the glass and irons it into a single
18-by-25-inch pane. Each one contains air bubbles and large wavy
bands and sells for $27, because some people like the aesthetics of
old glass _ people in charge of historical landmarks, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, recalls Blenko's Lewis Powers, the company got
a large order for replacement panes from the White House: ``They
wanted the wavy look.''

<P>
   Walk by Cynthia Breazeal's workbench in MIT's Artificial
Intelligence Lab, and you can't help but notice a hunk of aluminum
filled with silicon chips and electric motors, a machine purposely
shaped and sized like a human head.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what you can't help noticing is that it looks lonely.
Its eyebrows are heavy, its pink ears appear crestfallen. Its huge
baby-doll eyes are scanning the room, searching for someone.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder that when Breazeal comes into the room and
sits down in front of her needy little robot named Kismet, its mood
begins to change. Looking straight into Kismet's eyes, Breazeal
offers a ``human face stimulus.''
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's eyebrows go straight up, making its baby blues appear
even wider as it looks straight back at its creator with growing
interest. ``Mutual regard,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kismet wiggles its ears up and down. ``Greeting behavior,''
Breazeal says.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's expressions alter into another state, the sort a parent
loves to evoke in a child. Happiness. Kismet is all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal, who created this creature, is not surprised:
``Happiness is the achievement of a desired stimulus,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Before you ask the question, Breazeal has the answer: ``The
behavior is not canned,'' she says. ``It is being computed and is
not a random thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Each interaction is different; each exchange has its own action
and narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seem to be some missing elements in this clever
personality. And Breazeal acknowledges that Kismet has not been
programmed for every emotion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she has been saving surprise for the day when she
installs the learning algorithms she is working on. Then learning
will become Kismet's desired stimulus; learning will make the robot
happy.
</P>
<P>
   As Kismet begins to learn, Breazeal says, it will slowly become
more socially sophisticated, like an infant becoming a small child.
That will bring Breazeal a lot closer to achieving her real goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' she says without hesitation, ``the ultimate milestone
is a robot that can be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Breazeal arrived at MIT in 1990 to begin working on her
master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science. She
didn't have a specific project in mind, only a general vision. She
knew she wanted to build a robot.
</P>
<P>
   At first she was fascinated by the robots being built by Rodney
Brooks, an MIT professor and innovator in artificial intelligence.
So she was elated when Brooks said he had one big project left in
him: an android inspired by Commander Data in the ``Star Trek'' TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   He had decided his masterwork _ a humanoid called Cog, for
``cognitive'' _ would be given human experiences and would learn
intelligence by interacting with the world.
</P>
<P>
   So the work began. Brooks' team built a body from the waist up.
He wrote a new computer language for programming it and designed a
new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal developed a stereo vision system. Another researcher
made a Ph.D. dissertation out of developing the robot's arms.
Breazeal and grad student Brian Scassellati worked on an attention
system, giving Cog the ability to distinguish between sound, color
and movement, and to orient itself toward a preferred source.
</P>
<P>
   They modeled the system on the Superior Colliculus, the part of
a vertebrate's brain that takes information from the senses, then
figures out where stimuli are coming from and which muscles to move
in response.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years Cog could make eye contact and move its head
to track a moving object. Then Cog could move like a human. Its
formidable but gentle arms could throw and catch a ball, play with
a Slinky, even listen to rock and roll and beat out a corresponding
rhythm on a snare drum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Breazeal began studying the process of cognitive
development in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get interested in the idea that infants are the
simplest people. I wanted people to be able to naturally fall into
the mode of treating the robot as if it were an infant, to
naturally help the robot as much as they could.''
</P>
<P>
   And she began to think that the statuesque android was not right
somehow. ``Cog is 6-foot-5, with shoulders out to here,'' she says.
``Its face is way up there, you can't get close to it, and it has
no facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I started thinking about building a separate robot platform
that focused on communication abilities that I cared about. I
wanted to have face-to-face exchange, with expressions and
eventually vocalization. That's when I started building Kismet, in
the summer of 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal took a spare Cog head and reengineered it, adding a
jaw. She got the eyes from a special-effects supplier in Los
Angeles. She set up small motors to move facial features _ eyebrows
that lift and arch, ears that lift and rotate, jaws that open and
close. A network of three integrated circuits control perception
and attention. Three more drive the facial motors, the motivational
system, and eye and neck motion.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal also had to write special software consisting of what
she calls ``drives'' and ``emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Drives are similar to needs, and there are three in Kismet. The
social drive becomes a need for people, the stimulation drive seeks
toys and other objects, and the fatigue drive creates a need for
sleep. Each drive has a normal position, a place it wants to be,
which Breazeal calls the ``homeostatic regime.''
</P>
<P>
   When unattended, the drives move into an understimulated regime,
so needs grow for social interaction and stimulation. Too much
activity and the drives drift into the overstimulated regime, and a
need grows for a break from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's emotions are not linear. They occupy a kind of
three-dimensional place Breazeal calls ``affect space.'' The
emotions break down into high and low values, positive and negative
states, open or closed positions, each conforming to research on
actual human emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal says happiness, for example, is a ``positive state with
a neutral value and an open position.'' In human terms, free and
easy with no worries; life is good.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is near the center of the homeostatic regime, a state
to which the robot aspires. The expression of interest is also
within the homeostatic regime. Calm is there too. Outside the
homeostatic regime lie other responses: sadness, boredom, fear,
disgust and anger.
</P>
<P>
   As drives move and shift and become satiated, other behaviors
rise and fall: ``engage toy,'' ``avoid toy'' and ``sleep.'' For
Kismet, the process of maintaining drives in the homeostatic regime
is never-ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing,'' Breazeal says matter-of-factly, ``is
putting humanity into the humanoid.''

 By ROBERT KUNZIG  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The house in France that I live in was built in the 16th
century, and though I doubt any of the windowpanes are original,
some of them are quite old. People go all wavy as they pass my
office. Those vertical distortions in the panes remind me that
glass _ brittle, breakable glass _ is really a fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that glass is a fluid is a very widespread myth,''
says Yvonne Stokes, a mathematician at the University of Adelaide
in Australia. ``I was told it as a fact by my adviser. And once, a
class of schoolchildren came into the lab, and one of them told me
the very same thing. If you want to talk microscopically, then you
can call glass a fluid. But people understandably tend to think
that if it's a fluid, it flows. It's that notion that's false.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes has recently proved with detailed calculations that old
windows could not have flowed perceptibly.
</P>
<P>
   If the myth survives, it will be because it contains a kernel of
truth _ and because glass is a confusing kind of matter, quite
unlike the three ordinary kinds.
</P>
<P>
   A gas is an anarchy of molecules going every which way; a liquid
is a tighter but still disorderly society in which molecules
constantly dissolve and re-establish weak bonds; a solid is a
molecular army in rigid formation.
</P>
<P>
   But glass is ... none of the above. It is rigid like a solid,
but its molecules are not arranged in repeating crystals. It is
amorphous like a liquid.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, structurally there is no sharp line between a liquid
and a glass. You form glass by ``supercooling'' a liquid below its
freezing point, then cooling it some more. If you cool it fast
enough, the molecules can't organize themselves into crystals. As
the temperature drops, the liquid becomes more viscous and the
molecules more sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Window glass is made mostly of sand _ with soda ash mixed in to
lower melting temperature and limestone to decrease solubility in
its final form _ but just about any liquid can be a glass if it is
cooled quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Some liquids are easier to turn into glass than others, however.
The more viscous a liquid is at its freezing point, the more
trouble the molecules will have moving into crystalline formation,
and the more likely they are to end up a glass instead.
</P>
<P>
   Glasses are everywhere these days _ and yet researchers are
still arguing about their very nature. Is a glass simply a liquid
in solid clothing? Or, as chemical engineer Pablo Debenedetti of
Princeton University puts it, is the glass around us really a
``masked version of something more profound,'' something called an
ideal glass?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called ideal because no one has seen it,'' Debenedetti
says. But as a theoretical concept it might explain some of the
properties of real glass.
</P>
<P>
   Debenedetti says real glass is puzzling because both the
temperature at which it forms and its final properties depend on
the rate at which the liquid is cooled: ``In order to tell you that
water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit or that it freezes at 32
degrees, I don't need to specify anything about the velocity of
heating or cooling. But the glass transition is different.''
</P>
<P>
   The slower you cool the melt, the lower the temperature at which
it will change into glass, and the more dense that glass will be.
So windowglass forms at anywhere between 1,472 and 1,022 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass, some theorists believe, is what you would
produce if you could cool a liquid with geologic slowness while
somehow preventing it from crystalizing. It would form at one
precise temperature, just as solids, liquids and gases do. Like
them, it would be a distinct phase of matter, and not merely _ like
ordinary glass _ a solid/liquid hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass would be as motionless and nearly as orderly as a
crystal, but it would not be a crystal. No one knows what it would
look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking me to engage in poetry,'' says Frank Stillinger
of Bell Labs. ``It's like saying, `What color is the hair of angels
dancing on the head of a pin?' I can't answer that question
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its structure, an ideal glass would be in equilibrium,
just like the other phases of matter _ but unlike real glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A glass is constantly evolving, trying to get to
equilibrium,'' Ediger says. ``A crystal is happy just to sit there,
because it's already at the bottom of an energy valley. A glass is
sitting on the side of a hill. And very, very slowly it does roll
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the fat kernel of truth inside the myth: Glass really
does flow_ just not on a human timescale. If you could somehow
preserve a cathedral window for long enough, it might become a
rigid puddle on the floor. Or it might become an opaque crystalline
solid. Conceivably, that church window might even evolve into an
ideal glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do the experiment for long enough,'' Ediger says.
``But it's a very interesting question.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Stokes has calculated how long would be long enough.
Assuming a windowpane simply flows downhill, she asked, how long
would it take for the bottom to get just 5 percent thicker?
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 million years, she figures _ and that is likely to
be a ``big underestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral windows may be thicker at the bottom, she says, simply
because handmade glass varies in thickness, and medieval builders
chose to put the thick ends down. And wavy old windowpanes are not
glass that has flowed; they're glass that was flawed from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most windows are made of flawless ``float glass'':
Molten glass is poured onto a bath of molten tin and allowed to
spread out and solidify into a perfectly flat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   But at Blenko Glass in Milton, W. Va., they still make
windowpanes the old-fashioned way. The artisan gets a ball of
molten glass on the end of his pipe, which he blows into a long,
cylindrical wooden mold so the malleable glass forms a hollow tube
inside.

old glass _ people in charge of historical landmarks, for instance.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The house in France that I live in was built in the 16th
century, and though I doubt any of the windowpanes are original,
some of them are quite old. People go all wavy as they pass my
office. Those vertical distortions in the panes remind me that
glass _ brittle, breakable glass _ is really a fluid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that glass is a fluid is a very widespread myth,''
says Yvonne Stokes, a mathematician at the University of Adelaide
in Australia. ``I was told it as a fact by my adviser. And once, a
class of schoolchildren came into the lab, and one of them told me
the very same thing. If you want to talk microscopically, then you
can call glass a fluid. But people understandably tend to think
that if it's a fluid, it flows. It's that notion that's false.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes has recently proved with detailed calculations that old
windows could not have flowed perceptibly.
</P>
<P>
   If the myth survives, it will be because it contains a kernel of
truth _ and because glass is a confusing kind of matter, quite
unlike the three ordinary kinds.
</P>
<P>
   A gas is an anarchy of molecules going every which way; a liquid
is a tighter but still disorderly society in which molecules
constantly dissolve and re-establish weak bonds; a solid is a
molecular army in rigid formation.
</P>
<P>
   But glass is ... none of the above. It is rigid like a solid,
but its molecules are not arranged in repeating crystals. It is
amorphous like a liquid.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, structurally there is no sharp line between a liquid
and a glass. You form glass by ``supercooling'' a liquid below its
freezing point, then cooling it some more. If you cool it fast
enough, the molecules can't organize themselves into crystals. As
the temperature drops, the liquid becomes more viscous and the
molecules more sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   Window glass is made mostly of sand _ with soda ash mixed in to
lower melting temperature and limestone to decrease solubility in
its final form _ but just about any liquid can be a glass if it is
cooled quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Some liquids are easier to turn into glass than others, however.
The more viscous a liquid is at its freezing point, the more
trouble the molecules will have moving into crystalline formation,
and the more likely they are to end up a glass instead.
</P>
<P>
   Glasses are everywhere these days _ and yet researchers are
still arguing about their very nature. Is a glass simply a liquid
in solid clothing? Or, as chemical engineer Pablo Debenedetti of
Princeton University puts it, is the glass around us really a
``masked version of something more profound,'' something called an
ideal glass?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's called ideal because no one has seen it,'' Debenedetti
says. But as a theoretical concept it might explain some of the
properties of real glass.
</P>
<P>
   Debenedetti says real glass is puzzling because both the
temperature at which it forms and its final properties depend on
the rate at which the liquid is cooled: ``In order to tell you that
water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit or that it freezes at 32
degrees, I don't need to specify anything about the velocity of
heating or cooling. But the glass transition is different.''
</P>
<P>
   The slower you cool the melt, the lower the temperature at which
it will change into glass, and the more dense that glass will be.
So windowglass forms at anywhere between 1,472 and 1,022 degrees
Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass, some theorists believe, is what you would
produce if you could cool a liquid with geologic slowness while
somehow preventing it from crystalizing. It would form at one
precise temperature, just as solids, liquids and gases do. Like
them, it would be a distinct phase of matter, and not merely _ like
ordinary glass _ a solid/liquid hybrid.
</P>
<P>
   An ideal glass would be as motionless and nearly as orderly as a
crystal, but it would not be a crystal. No one knows what it would
look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking me to engage in poetry,'' says Frank Stillinger
of Bell Labs. ``It's like saying, `What color is the hair of angels
dancing on the head of a pin?' I can't answer that question
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its structure, an ideal glass would be in equilibrium,
just like the other phases of matter _ but unlike real glasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``A glass is constantly evolving, trying to get to
equilibrium,'' Ediger says. ``A crystal is happy just to sit there,
because it's already at the bottom of an energy valley. A glass is
sitting on the side of a hill. And very, very slowly it does roll
down.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the fat kernel of truth inside the myth: Glass really
does flow_ just not on a human timescale. If you could somehow
preserve a cathedral window for long enough, it might become a
rigid puddle on the floor. Or it might become an opaque crystalline
solid. Conceivably, that church window might even evolve into an
ideal glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't do the experiment for long enough,'' Ediger says.
``But it's a very interesting question.''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Stokes has calculated how long would be long enough.
Assuming a windowpane simply flows downhill, she asked, how long
would it take for the bottom to get just 5 percent thicker?
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 million years, she figures _ and that is likely to
be a ``big underestimate.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral windows may be thicker at the bottom, she says, simply
because handmade glass varies in thickness, and medieval builders
chose to put the thick ends down. And wavy old windowpanes are not
glass that has flowed; they're glass that was flawed from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays most windows are made of flawless ``float glass'':
Molten glass is poured onto a bath of molten tin and allowed to
spread out and solidify into a perfectly flat sheet.
</P>
<P>
   But at Blenko Glass in Milton, W. Va., they still make
windowpanes the old-fashioned way. The artisan gets a ball of
molten glass on the end of his pipe, which he blows into a long,
cylindrical wooden mold so the malleable glass forms a hollow tube
inside.
</P>
<P>
   After the glass cools, he removes it from the mold, scores it
lengthwise, reheats the glass and irons it into a single
18-by-25-inch pane. Each one contains air bubbles and large wavy
bands and sells for $27, because some people like the aesthetics of
old glass _ people in charge of historical landmarks, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, recalls Blenko's Lewis Powers, the company got
a large order for replacement panes from the White House: ``They
wanted the wavy look.''

<P>
   Walk by Cynthia Breazeal's workbench in MIT's Artificial
Intelligence Lab, and you can't help but notice a hunk of aluminum
filled with silicon chips and electric motors, a machine purposely
shaped and sized like a human head.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, what you can't help noticing is that it looks lonely.
Its eyebrows are heavy, its pink ears appear crestfallen. Its huge
baby-doll eyes are scanning the room, searching for someone.
</P>
<P>
   So it's no wonder that when Breazeal comes into the room and
sits down in front of her needy little robot named Kismet, its mood
begins to change. Looking straight into Kismet's eyes, Breazeal
offers a ``human face stimulus.''
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's eyebrows go straight up, making its baby blues appear
even wider as it looks straight back at its creator with growing
interest. ``Mutual regard,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kismet wiggles its ears up and down. ``Greeting behavior,''
Breazeal says.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's expressions alter into another state, the sort a parent
loves to evoke in a child. Happiness. Kismet is all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal, who created this creature, is not surprised:
``Happiness is the achievement of a desired stimulus,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Before you ask the question, Breazeal has the answer: ``The
behavior is not canned,'' she says. ``It is being computed and is
not a random thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Each interaction is different; each exchange has its own action
and narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seem to be some missing elements in this clever
personality. And Breazeal acknowledges that Kismet has not been
programmed for every emotion.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she has been saving surprise for the day when she
installs the learning algorithms she is working on. Then learning
will become Kismet's desired stimulus; learning will make the robot
happy.
</P>
<P>
   As Kismet begins to learn, Breazeal says, it will slowly become
more socially sophisticated, like an infant becoming a small child.
That will bring Breazeal a lot closer to achieving her real goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me,'' she says without hesitation, ``the ultimate milestone
is a robot that can be your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Breazeal arrived at MIT in 1990 to begin working on her
master's degree in electrical engineering and computer science. She
didn't have a specific project in mind, only a general vision. She
knew she wanted to build a robot.
</P>
<P>
   At first she was fascinated by the robots being built by Rodney
Brooks, an MIT professor and innovator in artificial intelligence.
So she was elated when Brooks said he had one big project left in
him: an android inspired by Commander Data in the ``Star Trek'' TV
series.
</P>
<P>
   He had decided his masterwork _ a humanoid called Cog, for
``cognitive'' _ would be given human experiences and would learn
intelligence by interacting with the world.
</P>
<P>
   So the work began. Brooks' team built a body from the waist up.
He wrote a new computer language for programming it and designed a
new operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal developed a stereo vision system. Another researcher
made a Ph.D. dissertation out of developing the robot's arms.
Breazeal and grad student Brian Scassellati worked on an attention
system, giving Cog the ability to distinguish between sound, color
and movement, and to orient itself toward a preferred source.
</P>
<P>
   They modeled the system on the Superior Colliculus, the part of
a vertebrate's brain that takes information from the senses, then
figures out where stimuli are coming from and which muscles to move
in response.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years Cog could make eye contact and move its head
to track a moving object. Then Cog could move like a human. Its
formidable but gentle arms could throw and catch a ball, play with
a Slinky, even listen to rock and roll and beat out a corresponding
rhythm on a snare drum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Breazeal began studying the process of cognitive
development in children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to get interested in the idea that infants are the
simplest people. I wanted people to be able to naturally fall into
the mode of treating the robot as if it were an infant, to
naturally help the robot as much as they could.''
</P>
<P>
   And she began to think that the statuesque android was not right
somehow. ``Cog is 6-foot-5, with shoulders out to here,'' she says.
``Its face is way up there, you can't get close to it, and it has
no facial expressions.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I started thinking about building a separate robot platform
that focused on communication abilities that I cared about. I
wanted to have face-to-face exchange, with expressions and
eventually vocalization. That's when I started building Kismet, in
the summer of 1997.''
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal took a spare Cog head and reengineered it, adding a
jaw. She got the eyes from a special-effects supplier in Los
Angeles. She set up small motors to move facial features _ eyebrows
that lift and arch, ears that lift and rotate, jaws that open and
close. A network of three integrated circuits control perception
and attention. Three more drive the facial motors, the motivational
system, and eye and neck motion.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal also had to write special software consisting of what
she calls ``drives'' and ``emotions.''
</P>
<P>
   Drives are similar to needs, and there are three in Kismet. The
social drive becomes a need for people, the stimulation drive seeks
toys and other objects, and the fatigue drive creates a need for
sleep. Each drive has a normal position, a place it wants to be,
which Breazeal calls the ``homeostatic regime.''
</P>
<P>
   When unattended, the drives move into an understimulated regime,
so needs grow for social interaction and stimulation. Too much
activity and the drives drift into the overstimulated regime, and a
need grows for a break from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Kismet's emotions are not linear. They occupy a kind of
three-dimensional place Breazeal calls ``affect space.'' The
emotions break down into high and low values, positive and negative
states, open or closed positions, each conforming to research on
actual human emotions.
</P>
<P>
   Breazeal says happiness, for example, is a ``positive state with
a neutral value and an open position.'' In human terms, free and
easy with no worries; life is good.
</P>
<P>
   Happiness is near the center of the homeostatic regime, a state
to which the robot aspires. The expression of interest is also
within the homeostatic regime. Calm is there too. Outside the
homeostatic regime lie other responses: sadness, boredom, fear,
disgust and anger.
</P>
<P>
   As drives move and shift and become satiated, other behaviors
rise and fall: ``engage toy,'' ``avoid toy'' and ``sleep.'' For
Kismet, the process of maintaining drives in the homeostatic regime
is never-ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing,'' Breazeal says matter-of-factly, ``is
putting humanity into the humanoid.''

   LIBERTY: Perhaps lost in all the hoopla over Union Station's

SAN FRANCISCO MAYORAL CANDIDATES MAP RUNOFF STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown and Board of
Supervisors President Tom Ammiano begin a political battle to
become the city's next leader, their election efforts already
appear to be vastly different.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano is seeking to widen his base of support by registering
new voters, many of them in the Mission District.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's campaign is focused on improving voter turnout in his
traditional strongholds, including Bayview-Hunters Point,
Visitacion Valley and the Western Addition rather than registering
new voters.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have until Nov. 15 to register to vote in the Dec. 14
run- off election.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's campaign aides said they were disappointed with turnout
in some neighborhoods where his support traditionally is high.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bayview-Hunters Point district, where Brown won 84.7
percent of the vote, only about one in three registered voters
turned out last week.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, 42.1 percent of voters in the predominantly
black neighborhood cast ballots, helping Brown oust then-Mayor
Frank Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some areas where we didn't turn out all our voters,''
said Brown campaign spokesman P.J. Johnston. ``We'll try to ratchet
that up.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown leaders unofficially began the new campaign Friday by
contacting precinct captains _ those directly responsible for
turning out voters across the city _ to talk about keeping
supporters tuned in over the next five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll make sure our troops are gathered and prepared for the
final push,'' Johnston said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Ammiano headquarters, supporters will push to get more
``disenfranchised'' residents registered, particularly in the
Mission, where Ammiano beat Brown by almost 2-1, said Ammiano
campaign spokesman Robert Haaland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've involved people in the campaign and in the process who
felt alienated,'' Haaland said. ``We're starting to register people
who haven't felt empowered or part of the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are areas where Tom has done very well like in the
Mission, where there's a lower registration rate,'' he added.
``We'll do extensive outreach efforts in The Mission. There's a
group of Latino activists who will run that.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Cusick, who is coordinating the voter registration drive
for Ammiano's campaign, said more than 100 volunteers armed with
voter registration cards hit shopping malls, heavily traveled
streets and movie theater lines Saturday and will continue to do so
throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way to spend the next 10 days,'' Cusick said.
We'll be all over the city. We honestly haven't thought about what
our target (number) is. ... We want everybody who is excited about
this campaign to have the opportunity to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Ammiano campaign will print and distribute
30,000 absentee ballot applications, hoping to get supporters to
vote early.
</P>
<P>
   David Lee, executive director of the non-profit Chinese-American
Voter Education Committee, predicts both the Brown and Ammiano
camps will try to expand their pools of voters through new
registrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard and seen Ammiano's people registering people even
as we speak,'' said Lee. ``But he's targeting younger voters. I
think in the final analysis of who voted for Ammiano it will show
that he got younger, first-time and new voters ... Ammiano's appeal
is to younger voters (through) his message of institutional change
in government.''
</P>
<P>
   But signing up younger voters and relying on them to cast
ballots is risky, said Lee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ammiano must increase the pool of younger voters because, I
kind of hate to say it, but, they are unreliable. You don't know if
they'll show up at the polls. That's why you have to augment that
with numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sheehy, a gay activist and Ammiano backer, disagrees with
Lee's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people who went to the trouble to get a pen and
write in Tom's name are going to suddenly find themselves too lazy
to get out of bed on election day,'' Sheehy said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown will increase the number of potential supporters by
registering more minority voters, particularly African Americans
and those of Asian descent, Lee predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lee said ``the tide is with Ammiano in terms of
registration.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown must find a way to appeal to older, disgruntled voters who
might have voted for Jordan or Clint Reilly and give them a reason
to vote for him, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll have to emphasize the differences between him and
Ammiano,'' Lee said. ``He must focus on Ammiano's policies ...
paint a picture that gives (voters) a reason why change is adverse
to them and why they should come out to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown spokesman Johnston said supporters had ``no sense of
urgency'' because they assumed from press coverage that the mayor
would win re-election. ``The urgency was replaced by complacency.''
</P>
<P>
   That will be avoided this time, Johnston said, because ``the
results themselves will be a wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Johnston believes that African American leaders,
stung by a 30 percent turnout in neighborhoods seen as Brown
strongholds, will work to improve that.
</P>
<P>
   Said campaign worker Lillian Edwards: ``I'm embarrassed, hurt
and angry'' by the lack of black support in Tuesday's mayoral race.
</P>
<P>
   She has walked her neighborhood soliciting support for the mayor
throughout the campaign. As she has most weekends this fall, she
volunteered again Saturday to walk door-to-door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like I'm going to have to walk a little longer with
the way things went,'' she said.

<P>
   Erase from your mind the image of ``earthy'' botanical skin-care
products sitting and gathering dust on the bottom shelf at
health-food stores, occasionally perused by the Birkenstock crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Think instead of creams that inspire the same fashion rush as a
pair of Manolo Blahniks _ and that are at least as costly, like
Shiseido's $450 La Creme from its Cle de Peau line, or botanical
leader Sisley's $300 Sisleya.
</P>
<P>
   Both have strong reputations and gorgeous packaging, but what
you're paying for are the ingredients: herbal enzymes and chestnut
rose fruit extract and the highest-quality vitamins, antioxidants
and essential oils that stimulate circulation and purify the skin.
</P>
<P>
   Plants, without a doubt, have become the latest trend in skin
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natural products are now more fashionable,'' concedes
Christian Courtin-Clarins, international vice president of Clarins
and the son of its founder, Jacques Courtin-Clarins, who used plant
extracts in the treatment oils of his physical-therapy practice,
the still-existing Institute Clarins in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very comfortable using plant extracts,'' says
Christian, who just introduced Energizing Morning Cream with
ingredients of ginseng, horse chestnut extract, peach and pineapple
extract and sage, to name but a few. ``They've been used for 3,000
years, and we know all of the side effects, both good and bad. When
you work with chemicals, you just don't know the long-term side
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Other botanical lines used by European women for decades, like
Decleor, Gatineau and Guinot, are only now starting to hit their
stride in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: Europeans have an inside-out approach to
skin care, while their American counterparts prefer
laboratory-concocted quick fixes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Europeans are into an evolution rather than a revolution when
it comes to skin care,'' says aesthetician Regina Viotto of the
Paul Labrecque Salon and Spa in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   An American faced with a pimple, for example, would go to a
dermatologist for a cortisone injection. A European would adjust
her diet and schedule a facial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Healthy skin isn't a quick fix,'' says Susan Kurz, president
of Dr. Hauschka Skin Care, the organic line from Germany. ``If you
apply a cortisone cream for acne, it will go away, but the problem
still exists within the system. You must look at what the skin is
doing and support that activity. The American consciousness is just
starting to understand this holistic approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Many, however, question the efficacy and scientific credibility
of botanicals and essential oils. Ancient tales of perfumers spared
from the Black Plague due to their contact with essential oils, or
modern-day ones of Decleor aestheticians never catching winter
colds and flu, are intriguing but hardly conclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Botanicals have been proven to have a therapeutic effect at a
certain level, but the concentration can fluctuate wildly from
batch to batch,'' says Dr. Nicholas Perricone, an assistant
professor of dermatology at Yale University Hospital and a
dermatologist in private practice in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   (Perricone is also the founder of a line of skin care called
N.V. Perricone, M.D. Cosmeceuticals and the chairman of the
International Symposium on Aging Skin.)
</P>
<P>
   However, he does point to breakthrough research being conducted
in Europe on the anti-aging effects of polyphenols, such as grape
seed extracts, and he's very pleased with the reparative abilities
of alpha-lipoic acid, which is derived from potatoes and
</P>
<P>
   is featured prominently in his own collection.
</P>
<P>
   Which leads to another misconception: Just because a treatment
is ``natural'' doesn't mean it was cooked up in a country kitchen.
In fact, the very opposite is often true.
</P>
<P>
   Hauschka is known for its stringent harvesting techniques, while
the Swiss homeopathic medicine manufacturer Weleda, a favorite of
Meryl Streep, cultivates its ingredients using ``bio-dynamic''
gardening: Plants are insecticide-, pesticide- and fertilizer-free,
and harvesting is done only on certain days and under certain moons
when plant energy is said to be at an optimum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yon-Ka in France manufactures its products in a
``white fabrication zone,'' a bacteria-free, filtered-air setting
that is normally required for pharmaceutical formulations that
involve the handling of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Advances in the study of aromatherapy have demonstrated the
compatibility of highly concentrated plant extracts with the human
body both internally and externally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essential oils are much more than a surface moisturizer,''
says Laura Peck Fennema, founder and president of Essentiel
Elements, a spa line out of San Francisco that recently introduced
a facial skin care collection that is ripe with botanical
ingredients. ``When applied topically, these oils enter into the
dermal layers quickly, deliver moisture more efficiently and
balance the skin, but they also work on a deeper level via the
olfactory system to relax and boost overall well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, America's curiosity is overcoming a natural
reticence to ``go botanical.'' Recent studies indicate that 50
percent of the population is now accessing some sort of alternative
medicine, from reflexology to acupuncture to ayurvedic spa
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Such phenomena aren't lost on the American skin care industry.
Skin-care lines are being introduced daily incorporating everything
from feng shui to ayurvedic principles _ and, in the case of
Elizabeth Arden's Millenium Energist Revitalizing Emulsion, even
organic food ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Senior vice president of research and development John McCook
believes women are looking for natural solutions. Their new cream
with a soy complex claims to alleviate ``energy crises'' in the
skin caused by menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Arden's studies found it outperformed traditional estrogen
replacement therapy in curing severely dry and rough skin often
associated with menopause.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can deliver performance through a natural, topical
route, then this is more acceptable than treating with a
pharmaceutical silver bullet,'' McCook says.
</P>
<P>
   Another popular French skin-care line, Guinot, uses a similar
soy derivative for the same purpose in its Pleine Vie cream.
</P>
<P>
   But with all of the technology available to us, why not whip up
synthetic versions of these ancient extracts that mimic the magic
of the originals?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is simple. ``Have you ever tasted fake crab?''
Fennema asks. ``It doesn't taste anything like the real thing.''

   &UR; GEORGE LAMOND: HOOKED ON SALSA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George LaMond isn't exactly new to the music scene. In the late
1980s he was something of a teen sensation as a freestyle singer.
But today he's switched gears to tropical salsa _ and singing in
his native tongue, Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   His new album, ``Entrega,'' released under the Prestigio
Recordings label, and its first single ``Que Te Vas'' (a salsa
version of the song originally composed by Mexican superstar Juan
Gabriel), has placed LaMond as a rising star within the Latino
music genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marc Anthony gave me my inspiration,'' said LaMond, when asked
about his decision to enter the salsa music arena. ``We were in Los
Angeles and Marc told me he had just finished his first
Spanish-language production. He said, `You have to listen to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And though he's been hooked on salsa ever since, LaMond knew
music was going to be his career long before he ever heard of Marc
Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 12 years old when I decided I wanted to sing,'' LaMond
said. ``I would mimic Michael Jackson and Luther Vandross. I used
to put shows together in my house. I have four sisters and I would
charge their friends 25 cents to watch me perform in my living
room. I would put our Christmas lights on the floor, turn the other
lights off and perform Menudo songs.''

 &UR; MICHAEL FREDO: NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you've never heard Michael Fredo, you've probably seen
him _ in the most recent Tommy Jeans ad campaign for television.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20-year-old Fredo is more than just a pretty face. His
just-released first album, ``Introducing Michael Fredo,'' on AH!
Records (a joint venture between Andy Hilfiger and Quincy Jones)
has earned positive reviews and he was a big hit with fans when he
opened for pop sensation Britney Spears this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of his songs will be on the soundtrack of the
film ``Black and White,'' to be released in March.
</P>
<P>
   At age 16, when most boys are thinking about dating, grades and
cars, Fredo was singlemindedly concentrating on his music career _
so much so that he decided to move to New York City from his
hometown of Elmira, N.Y., just to pursue a music education at the
Professional Children's School.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to learning a lot, Fredo made an important
connection. ``I went to school with Paul Ellington, Duke's
grandson, and he introduced me to his father, Mercer,'' recalls
Fredo. ``Just as a goof, he (Mercer) asked me to sing with his band
for rehearsal and I was then asked to join the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredo performed with the Duke Ellington Orchestra for the next
year. But shortly after Fredo graduated high school, his father
passed away, and Fredo turned to songwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, another connection contributed to his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Quincy Jones at a party in L.A.,'' Fredo said. ``Andy
Hilfiger introduced me to him and asked if I could sing to him with
my guitar. He heard me sing in my hotel room and then I flew back
to New York to cut a demo for Quincy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his fashion style, Fredo has given up cargo pants for
leather, and sneakers for snakeskin boots. But above all, ``I'm now
attracted to more of the fitted look. The year 2000 is the fitted
age,'' he said. ``People are sick of baggy clothes. It's cool but
sometimes they drag on the ground and the bottom gets you filthy
dirty.''

   &UR; GEORGE LAMOND: HOOKED ON SALSA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George LaMond isn't exactly new to the music scene. In the late
1980s he was something of a teen sensation as a freestyle singer.
But today he's switched gears to tropical salsa _ and singing in
his native tongue, Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   His new album, ``Entrega,'' released under the Prestigio
Recordings label, and its first single ``Que Te Vas'' (a salsa
version of the song originally composed by Mexican superstar Juan
Gabriel), has placed LaMond as a rising star within the Latino
music genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marc Anthony gave me my inspiration,'' said LaMond, when asked
about his decision to enter the salsa music arena. ``We were in Los
Angeles and Marc told me he had just finished his first
Spanish-language production. He said, `You have to listen to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And though he's been hooked on salsa ever since, LaMond knew
music was going to be his career long before he ever heard of Marc
Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 12 years old when I decided I wanted to sing,'' LaMond
said. ``I would mimic Michael Jackson and Luther Vandross. I used
to put shows together in my house. I have four sisters and I would
charge their friends 25 cents to watch me perform in my living
room. I would put our Christmas lights on the floor, turn the other
lights off and perform Menudo songs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, LaMond came close to being one of the members of the
popular teen Latin group that give Ricky Martin his start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 13 when I tried out for Menudo,'' LaMond recalled. ``I
made it to the 100 finalists.''
</P>
<P>
   But that brush with rejection didn't stop LaMond from pursuing
his music career. He began networking and that soon paid off,
courtesy of a good friend's girlfriend.

and was looking for people to manage. She had connections with a
lot of independent labels. I eventually did a demo and that turned
into a label deal.''

</P>

   1. DO DIM BULBS MAKE BETTER PRESIDENTS? by Jacob Weisberg
</P>
<P>
   The case against intellect in the White House is brilliantly
counterintuitive, and might work to George W. Bush's advantage. The
argument rests mainly on some fairly compelling anecdotal evidence.
The list of less-than-brilliant men judged great by those making
this argument usually begins with Ronald Reagan and often includes
Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman as well. The list of
intellectually gifted but ineffectual presidents has Jimmy Carter,
Richard Nixon, Herbert Hoover, and Woodrow Wilson.

   2. WHO'S AFRAID OF NAOMI WOLF? by William Saletan
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looked like this was going to be the most
substantive presidential election in years, along comes the
brouhaha over Naomi Wolf. The media seized on the story (``Gore's
Secret Guru,'' shouted Time) as a fresh source of groans and
titters. Pundits agree that by hiring such a ``controversial
feminist,'' Gore has embarrassed himself and exposed his personal
and political ``confusion.'' The real confusion, however, seems to
be over why Wolf is controversial or embarrassing.

<P>
   Although I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies

the plain of Armageddon, I have a feeling I may be the Antichrist.
The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian
eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive.
These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified
by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.

</P>
<P>
   Today, LaMond likes to dress ``back to hip-hop'' with brands
such as Fubu, Timberland and Avirex. Onstage, however, he wears
Italian-made suits as well as Diesel's vintage clothing.

   As for his fashion style, Fredo has given up cargo pants for
leather, and sneakers for snakeskin boots. But above all, ``I'm now
attracted to more of the fitted look. The year 2000 is the fitted
age,'' he said. ``People are sick of baggy clothes. It's cool but
sometimes they drag on the ground and the bottom gets you filthy
dirty.''

   &UR; GEORGE LAMOND: HOOKED ON SALSA &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   George LaMond isn't exactly new to the music scene. In the late
1980s he was something of a teen sensation as a freestyle singer.
But today he's switched gears to tropical salsa _ and singing in
his native tongue, Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   His new album, ``Entrega,'' released under the Prestigio
Recordings label, and its first single ``Que Te Vas'' (a salsa
version of the song originally composed by Mexican superstar Juan
Gabriel), has placed LaMond as a rising star within the Latino
music genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marc Anthony gave me my inspiration,'' said LaMond, when asked
about his decision to enter the salsa music arena. ``We were in Los
Angeles and Marc told me he had just finished his first
Spanish-language production. He said, `You have to listen to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   And though he's been hooked on salsa ever since, LaMond knew
music was going to be his career long before he ever heard of Marc
Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 12 years old when I decided I wanted to sing,'' LaMond
said. ``I would mimic Michael Jackson and Luther Vandross. I used
to put shows together in my house. I have four sisters and I would
charge their friends 25 cents to watch me perform in my living
room. I would put our Christmas lights on the floor, turn the other
lights off and perform Menudo songs.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, LaMond came close to being one of the members of the
popular teen Latin group that give Ricky Martin his start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 13 when I tried out for Menudo,'' LaMond recalled. ``I
made it to the 100 finalists.''
</P>
<P>
   But that brush with rejection didn't stop LaMond from pursuing
his music career. He began networking and that soon paid off,
courtesy of a good friend's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sang for Marilyn Rodriguez,'' he said. ``She had already
written a hit single for C Bank called `I Won't Stop Loving You'
and was looking for people to manage. She had connections with a
lot of independent labels. I eventually did a demo and that turned
into a label deal.''
</P>
<P>
   By age 19, LaMond had sold 180,000 copies of his single, ``Bad
of the Heart,'' also written by Rodriguez, and in 1990 he signed
with Columbia, which released an album, also called ``Bad of the
Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia also rereleased the single, which sold another 200,000
copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from a guy who used to work at Blimpie making $150 a
week to making $15,000 a week.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his sartorial style, it's a lot different than when he
was in his late teens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wear belts with gold plates, Lee and Adidas as a
kid,'' he said. ``When it came time to be the performer, everything
was suits. Coming from the Bronx, I used to buy suits at Oaktree.
Then I started going into little boutiques and to stores like
French Connection and Armani.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, LaMond likes to dress ``back to hip-hop'' with brands
such as Fubu, Timberland and Avirex. Onstage, however, he wears
Italian-made suits as well as Diesel's vintage clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not wearing suits 24 hours a day,'' said LaMond, when
discussing the new look for the modern salsero. ``We're
accessorizing and wearing brands such as Kenneth Cole. But I'm very
plain, simple. I don't like loud colors.''
</P>

 &UR; MICHAEL FREDO: NOT JUST A PRETTY FACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even if you've never heard Michael Fredo, you've probably seen
him _ in the most recent Tommy Jeans ad campaign for television.
</P>
<P>
   But the 20-year-old Fredo is more than just a pretty face. His
just-released first album, ``Introducing Michael Fredo,'' on AH!
Records (a joint venture between Andy Hilfiger and Quincy Jones)
has earned positive reviews and he was a big hit with fans when he
opened for pop sensation Britney Spears this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of his songs will be on the soundtrack of the
film ``Black and White,'' to be released in March.
</P>
<P>
   At age 16, when most boys are thinking about dating, grades and
cars, Fredo was singlemindedly concentrating on his music career _
so much so that he decided to move to New York City from his
hometown of Elmira, N.Y., just to pursue a music education at the
Professional Children's School.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to learning a lot, Fredo made an important
connection. ``I went to school with Paul Ellington, Duke's
grandson, and he introduced me to his father, Mercer,'' recalls
Fredo. ``Just as a goof, he (Mercer) asked me to sing with his band
for rehearsal and I was then asked to join the tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Fredo performed with the Duke Ellington Orchestra for the next
year. But shortly after Fredo graduated high school, his father
passed away, and Fredo turned to songwriting.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, another connection contributed to his fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Quincy Jones at a party in L.A.,'' Fredo said. ``Andy
Hilfiger introduced me to him and asked if I could sing to him with
my guitar. He heard me sing in my hotel room and then I flew back
to New York to cut a demo for Quincy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his fashion style, Fredo has given up cargo pants for
leather, and sneakers for snakeskin boots. But above all, ``I'm now
attracted to more of the fitted look. The year 2000 is the fitted
age,'' he said. ``People are sick of baggy clothes. It's cool but
sometimes they drag on the ground and the bottom gets you filthy
dirty.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JEFFREY GOLDBERG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early one shiny autumn morning, I got in my car and drove to
Lynchburg, Va., in order to find out whether or not I am the
Antichrist. You know: the Beast, the Worthless Shepherd, the Little
Horn, the Abomination, the linchpin of the Diabolical Trinity. That
Antichrist.
</P>
<P>
   I had my suspicions. Nowhere on my body could I find the mark of
the Beast--666--but I do have a freckle that's shaped like Bermuda.
And though I have never been seized by a desire to lead the armies
of Satan in a final, bloody confrontation with the forces of God on
the plain of Armageddon, I do suffer from aggravated dyspepsia, as
well as chronic malaise, conditions that I'm sure afflict the
Antichrist.
</P>
<P>
   The surest suspicion I had about my pivotal role in Christian
eschatology grew from the fact that I am Jewish, male, and alive.
These are the qualifications for the job of Antichrist as specified
by Lynchburg's most famous preacher, Jerry Falwell, in a speech he
made earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   I was actually going to see the Reverend Falwell on a different
matter, the future of Jerusalem, but I thought I might just slip
this question--the one about me maybe being the Antichrist--into
the stream of the interview. Falwell, I guessed, wouldn't be happy
to discuss his views on the identity of the Antichrist--he had
apologized for the remark but took quite a load of grief for it
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, though, Falwell was eager to talk about the
Antichrist. And, as it also turned out, he didn't really feel bad
for saying what he said. In fact, he was more convinced than ever
that the Antichrist is a Jew who walks among us.
</P>
<P>
   Let me pause for a moment to give three concise reasons why I'm
so curious about the identity of the Antichrist:
</P>
<P>
   --I think I speak for all the approximately 4.5 million adult
male Jews in the world when I say that we get a little antsy when
Christians start looking at us like we're the devil. This is on
account of Christian behavior over the past 2,000 years, by which I
mean blood libels and pogroms and inquisitions, those sorts of
things.
</P>
<P>
   --I've always been possessed by the delusional notion that I am
to play a major role in world history, so why not a role in the End
of Days? And I don't mean the Schwarzenegger movie.
</P>
<P>
   --Now that we stand on the lip of the millennium, much of the
evangelical Christian world is in the grip of Armageddon fever,
and, according to the evangelical interpretation of the books of
Daniel and Revelation, the Antichrist will make his appearance
before Christ makes his, and his is looking kinda imminent. The
Antichrist, in this reading, will be a world leader who strikes a
peace deal with Israel, only to betray the Jewish state and make
war on it, until Jesus comes to the rescue. The thankful Jews,
those who are still alive, will then become Christians and live
happily ever after. These beliefs, held by tens of millions of
Christians are, journalistically speaking, worthy of note.
</P>
<P>
   The day before my visit with Falwell, I had just finished
reading a novelistic treatment of these events, ``Assassins,''
which is subtitled ``Assignment: Jerusalem, Target: Antichrist.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Assassins'' is the sixth book in the ``Left Behind'' series,
``left behind'' referring to those unfortunate nonevangelical
Christians who are not taken up to heaven in the Rapture--the
opening act in God's end days plan--and are forced to contend with
the Antichrist's evil reign on Earth. The ``Left Behind'' series,
co-written by Tim LaHaye, the prominent right-wing screwball and
husband of Beverly LaHaye, the even more prominent right-wing
screwball, and Jerry B. Jenkins, who, his biography states, is the
author of 130 books, which is a lot of books for one guy to write,
is a phenomenon. Ten million copies of the series have sold
already--hundreds in my local PriceClub alone. ``Left Behind'' is
the Harry Potter of the Armageddon set.
</P>
<P>
   The notable thing for me about the ``Left Behind''
series--beside the fact that few in the secular media have noticed
that millions of Americans are busy reading books warning about the
imminence of one-world government, mass death, and the return of
the Messiah, is that all the Jewish characters are Christian.
LaHaye and Jenkins are both active participants in the absurd and
feverish campaign by some evangelical Christians to redefine
Judaism in a way that allows for belief in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   Jews (and again, I feel comfortable speaking for all of us here)
find this sort of Christian imperialism just a wee bit offensive.
Just imagine if Jews began an official campaign calling Muhammad
irrelevant to Islam--can you imagine the fatwas that would produce?
</P>
<P>
   But evangelical leaders, who are, in my experience, uniformly
kind and generous in their personal relations, can also be terribly
obnoxious in their relations with Jews.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one road to salvation for Jews, and that road runs
through Jesus, LaHaye told me. To his credit, though, LaHaye
doesn't believe that the Antichrist will be Jewish. He will be a
European gentile, who will kill lots of Jews. ``The Jews will be
forced to accept the idolatry of the Antichrist or be beheaded,''
he said. This will take place during the seven-year Tribulation.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish suffering, though, is divinely ordained. Even though the
Antichrist will not be Jewish, Jews are still capable of great evil
and have often been punished for their evil, LaHaye explained.
``Some of the greatest evil in the history of the world was
concocted in the Jewish mind,'' LaHaye told me, for reasons that
aren't entirely clear--he knew what the name ``Goldberg'' generally
signifies. ``Sigmund Freud, Marx, these were Jewish minds that were
infected with atheism.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked LaHaye to tell me more about the Jewish mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish brain also has the capacity for great good,'' he
explained. ``God gave the Jews great intelligence. He didn't give
them great size or physical power--you don't see too many Jews in
the NFL--but he gave them great minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the evangelical leaders I have interviewed, LaHaye is
capable of some of the most anti-Semitic utterances, which is
troublesome, because he is also the most popular author in the
evangelical world.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell is smoother than LaHaye. He acknowledges ``where the
sensitivity comes from,'' though he shows no understanding of the
role the myth of the Antichrist played in the history of
anti-Semitism, and he refuses to back away from his opinion that
somewhere in Great Neck or West L.A. or Shaker Heights is living
Satan's agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion,'' he told me, ``the Antichrist will be a
counterfeit of the true Christ, which means that he will be male
and Jewish, since Jesus was male and Jewish.''
</P>
<P>
   I asked him if he understood that such statements strip Jews of
their humanity, which is the first step anti-Semites take before
they kill them. He responded, ``All the Jewish people we do
business with on a daily basis, not one has ever got upset over
this.'' It is not Jews who picked this most recent fight, he said,
it is supporters of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Graham made the same statement a dozen times last year,
but there was no comment about that,'' Falwell said. ``But Billy
Graham was not calling for the resignation of the president.''
Falwell, you'll recall, is no fan of Clinton's; he has even peddled
a video accusing the president of murder.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell is right: Evangelical preachers are constantly accusing
the Jews of harboring the Antichrist.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Falwell if he knew the actual identity of the
Antichrist. No, he said. ``People might say, it's a certain person,
it's Henry Kissinger, like that, but the Lord does not let us know
that.''
</P>
<P>
   So there's a chance, then, that I'm the Antichrist?
</P>
<P>
   Falwell chuckled a condescending chuckle. ``It's almost amusing,
that question. Of course not. I know that you're not.''
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Antichrist will be a world leader, he'll have supernatural
powers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He got me there--I have no supernatural powers. I can't even
drive a stick shift.
</P>
<P>
   I pressed him further on the identity of the Antichrist, but
Falwell wouldn't play. ``We'll know the Antichrist when he
arrives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most evangelical leaders, in fact, refuse to publicly guess the
name of the Antichrist--though, as Falwell suggests, Kissinger is a
perennial favorite, at least among those evangelicals who believe
the Antichrist will be Jewish. For most of their history, Christian
leaders had been content to ascribe the characteristics of the
Antichrist to the Jewish people as a whole. ``Ever since the 2nd
century CE, the very beginning of the Antichrist legend, Christians
have associated Jews with everything unholy,'' Andrew Gow, who
teaches Christian history at the University of Alberta, told me. In
the minds of early Christian leaders, the church was the new
Israel; God's covenant with the Jews was obsolete. Therefore, the
Jews who remained on Earth were there to serve devilish purposes,
Gow explained.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of evangelical thinkers who differ with
Falwell, who believe, like LaHaye, that the Antichrist will be a
gentile who rises out of Europe. ``The Antichrist is supposed to
make a peace treaty with Israel,'' Ed Hindson, the author of ``Is
the Antichrist Alive and Well?'' explained. ``Why would a Jew make
a peace treaty with a Jewish state?''
</P>
<P>
   Hindson suggested that Satan will make the Antichrist the leader
of the European Union--the revived Roman Empire, eternal enemy of
Israel--though Hindson disputed one popular idea advocated by Monte
Judah, an Oklahoma-based prophecy-teacher, that Prince Charles is
the Antichrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way Prince Charles is the Antichrist,'' Hindson
said. ``Satan can do better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Hindson runs through a list of potential
candidates. Bill Clinton is there, of course, as well as Saddam
Hussein and Ronald Wilson Reagan (six letters in each of his three
names. Get it?).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, none of these men are gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says in the Bible that the Antichrist will have 'no regard
for women,' and so many evangelicals interpret that to mean that he
will be a homosexual,'' Hindson said, though he added that he's not
entirely convinced.
</P>
<P>
   This idea--the Antichrist as gay--strikes a chord with many
evangelicals, just as the idea that the Antichrist is Jewish
strikes a chord.
</P>
<P>
   I gradually came to see how far-fetched it was to think that I
might be the Antichrist. I'm not gay, I'm not famous, I wouldn't
know a euro if I found one in my wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Then it struck me: Barry Diller is the Antichrist.
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to know for sure. But if you wake up one morning
to read that Barry Diller is the head of the European Union (and
that David Geffen is his deputy), well, remember where you read it
first.

   &UR; By JACOB WEISBERG &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Last week's New Yorker reproduces a document that George W. Bush
wasn't eager to have published: his Yale transcript, which includes
his SAT scores (566 verbal, 640 math) and college grades (C
average). One doesn't want to read too much into someone's
35-year-old academic records, which in this case are mainly
interesting as a reminder of how powerful the Ivy League's
affirmative-action program for alumni brats used to be. But the
data do tend to substantiate what many have gleaned from listening
to the Republican front-runner abuse the English language: The
sharpest tool in the shed he ain't.
</P>
<P>
   The two authors of the New Yorker article, Jane Mayer and
Alexandra Robbins, buttress their insult to the governor's privacy
with a backhanded compliment. ``Historically, there is no
correlation between academic achievement and success in the Oval
Office,'' they note. Many of Bush's highbrow conservative
supporters, such as George Will, go even farther, arguing that
thick-headedness is a positive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent column lauding Bush, Will recalls the contest
between three book-writers for president in 1912--Teddy Roosevelt,
Woodrow Wilson, and William Howard Taft--noting that ``such
intellect in politics is rare, and perhaps should be.'' The
conservative writer Richard Brookhiser recently made a version of
the same case in American Heritage. ``Perhaps the wise leader
should strive to have intellectuals on tap and not be one
himself,'' Brookhiser writes.
</P>
<P>
   The case against intellect in the White House is brilliantly
counterintuitive. If only Dan Quayle had been able to grasp it, he
might have used it to great advantage in this year's presidential
race. But is it correct? The argument rests mainly on some fairly
compelling anecdotal evidence. The list of less-than-brilliant men
judged great by those making this argument usually begins with
Ronald Reagan and often includes Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S.
Truman as well. The list of intellectually gifted but ineffectual
presidents has Jimmy Carter, Richard Nixon, Herbert Hoover, and
Woodrow Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Objection: The sample here is too small to be statistically
meaningful. It could just be a coincidence that Carter happened to
be both bright and inept, and that Reagan was both disconnected and
lovable. Another problem: The names on the list are subject to
extensive quibbling.
</P>
<P>
   Was Reagan really a great president? Was Wilson a failure, just
because Congress rejected the Versailles treaty? Someday, someone
will demolish the myth of Carter's alleged brilliance. And was FDR,
who took gentleman Cs at Harvard, truly less than highly
intelligent? This supposition relies heavily on Oliver Wendell
Holmes' oft-quoted observation that Roosevelt was a ``second-class
intellect but a first class temperament.'' There is a great deal of
evidence to suggest that Holmes was wrong about this and that FDR,
unserious in college, had the supplest of political wits about him.
</P>
<P>
   I can also provide some equally tendentious counterexamples.
Highly capable 20th-century presidents who were sharp as tacks
include John F. Kennedy and--bring on the hate mail!--William
Jefferson Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A list of relative dimwits who were lousy chief executives might
include Warren G. Harding (who described himself, accurately, as
too dumb to be president) and Gerald R. Ford (who played one too
many games without a helmet, in the memorable phrase of Lyndon B.
Johnson).
</P>
<P>
   Given that stupidity is not an advantage in any other
profession, why would it help a president? I think the theory
derives from the familiar prejudice against intelligence, which
holds that people who are too smart must be limited in other ways.
There's a popular notion that people who think too much can't
act--Hamlet is not the guy you want to run your company.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a conservative, political version of this idea,
which holds that intellectuals are bound to be impractical,
immoral, and too eager to impose their rationalist, radical schemes
on the rest of us. William F. Buckley expressed this view for the
ages when he made his famous observation that he'd rather be ruled
by the first hundred names in the Cambridge phone book than by the
faculty of Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   But the dumb-is-better argument falls apart when you look more
closely at the personal qualities and corresponding successes and
failures of just about any president. The ones who were dim but
successful successfully compensated for their dimness with other
qualities. But the lack of intelligence still harmed them.
</P>
<P>
   Take Ronald Reagan--please. I don't dispute that Reagan deserves
copious credit for bringing an early and glorious end to the Cold
War. One of the ways he did this was by taking an unambiguous moral
stand against Communism, which gave powerful encouragement to the
opposition in Eastern-bloc countries. But the moral certainty that
caused Reagan to behave in this way wasn't a tribute to his
thickness. Vaclav Havel acted just as single-mindedly.
</P>
<P>
   But an American president also needs to grasp more complex
realities--and Reagan often couldn't. When it came to understanding
something mildly technical, such as the federal budget, he was
baffled. As described by David Stockman, he simply couldn't process
the information that his contradictory goals would produce a vast
deficit, despite repeated attempts to spell it out for him in words
and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Or look at Richard Nixon. Nixon's strong intelligence is the
reason that there is something on the plus side of his presidential
ledger. Most scholars agree that Nixon's most significant
accomplishment--the opening of relations with China--was the
product of his own shrewd analysis of foreign policy, not Henry
Kissinger's. Nixon himself wrote an article on the subject in
Foreign Affairs in 1967 laying out the case for what he
subsequently did.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was undone as president not because he was too shrewd but
because of something shrewdness didn't help him with: personal
bitterness and lack of scruples.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise with Bill Clinton. Where Clinton has deployed his own
formidable brain, primarily in economic and some areas of domestic
policy, he has largely succeeded. Where he does his thinking with
other organs, he has undermined himself.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I think the conservative case for presidential
stupidity has it exactly backwards. Presidents get into the most
trouble not when they behave like intellectuals but when they
delegate crucial brainwork to ``intellectuals on tap,'' as
Brookhiser calls them.
</P>
<P>
   A history of this sort of folly might start with some of the
failed schemes of the New Deal economists before describing the way
that the ``whiz kids'' led LBJ astray on both the Vietnam War and
the war on poverty. It would touch on the bad advice Pat Moynihan
gave Richard Nixon on welfare and that Ira Magaziner gave Bill
Clinton on health care. There is probably no modern president,
smart or dumb, who hasn't landed himself in hot water by hiring
intellectuals and then failing to second-guess them.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, intelligence of the kind that might manifest itself
in high SAT scores isn't the most important quality in a chief
executive. Leadership, integrity, and determination are all more
critical qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Dumb luck helps. Dumbness doesn't.

AFFLUENT COMMUNITY DEALS WITH DIVERSITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANNIE NAKAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ In this affluent, largely white enclave famed
for its elegant homes, good schools and, residents say,
``politeness and protocol,'' it used to be that the only
``different'' folks in town were Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But an increasingly diverse Piedmont recently has found itself
grappling with race relations after allegations of racial profiling
by town police provoked a good deal of civic upset and, some say,
illuminating debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that people are talking,'' said Maude
Pervere, a white resident and community activist. ``That's a rare
thing anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst: an Oct. 5 opinion piece in the weekly Piedmont
Post on a reported traffic stop of two black baseball coaches
visiting the city.
</P>
<P>
   Written by a white resident and teacher, the piece touched off a
flurry of reaction _ from Police Chief John Moilan, who called the
account inaccurate and incomplete, and former Mayor Clark Galloway,
who dismissed the story as ``baloney,'' to those who called it
``the ugly truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the controversy has occurred as Piedmont, on some
levels, has attempted to embrace diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Once virtually all white, this town of nearly 11,000 residents
is now 20 percent Asian American, and roughly 5 to 8 percent black
and Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Those changes _ along with an influx of young families who moved
to Piedmont after the 1991 East Bay hills fire _ have had a
dramatic impact.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the changes, some residents feel that Piedmont's
historic insularity _ perceived or real _ still makes some
minorities feel unwelcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rightly or wrongly, Piedmont had that image of being a city
that's restrictive or not welcoming to people of color,'' said Sue
Tamura, an Asian American civil rights attorney who sits on the
town's year-old Community Relations Committee. ``People have those
memories.''
</P>
<P>
   Lingering perceptions, she and others say, are what have fed the
recent controversy over resident Linda Wallace's article.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Wallace said she'd invited the coaches to a football
game, but they were stopped twice by police on their way to the
field and never came to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said that incident _ along with another involving police
questioning a black high school student _ amounted to racial
profiling. This assertion has been vigorously disputed by police
and city leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racism is a serious charge about which we are all concerned,''
wrote Police Chief Moilan in the Post. ``Inaccurate, incomplete
information was used to accuse the Piedmont Police Department of
wrongdoing. The charges hurt the department and the community ...
and the charges were false.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts remain in dispute _ Moilan said no stops were made by
either Piedmont or Oakland police in that area. A private security
guard was at the field enforcing a parking ban.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe something happened _ I have no reason not to believe
the coach, but we have to respond with facts,'' said Moilan, who
added that Piedmont is voluntarily tracking traffic stops by race
and gives its officers diversity training.
</P>
<P>
   Moilan was strongly defended by City Administrator Geoff Grote,
who called Wallace's account ``badly mischaracterized. In the
future, I hope we get specific facts prior to making a media
event.''
</P>
<P>
   But others have chided city officials for focusing on the
disputed facts and not the underlying issues of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   A letter in Tuesday's Post, signed by five members of an ad hoc
racially diverse group of residents calling themselves the Piedmont
Human Relations Committee, said: ``Many of us moved to Piedmont
because of its safety, small-town feel, beauty and excellent
schools. Yet beneath this tranquil exterior, the larger community
often does not hear minority voices.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad hoc group, for example, had asked the City Council to
establish a Human Relations Commission to address racial incidents.
Instead, the council created an advisory Community Relations
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Patty White said the council didn't want an ``additional
layer of bureaucracy.'' A new commission also would have required
an expensive ballot measure.
</P>
<P>
   As for tensions, White said she didn't perceive any.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I would say there are problems or issues,''
she said. ``I think there's an urge to have people understand each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   But, noted Lisa Coffey Mahoney, a reporter for the weekly
Piedmonter, diversity isn't a subject people discuss easily,
especially in Piedmont.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to sweep it out of sight,'' said Mahoney. ``They
don't talk about it. Yes, there are issues. It's not that people
have mean intentions. It's just that this town has been so
one-dimensional for so long that they don't realize that the things
they say or do may offend people.''

FOLLOW THE MONEY: HILLARY'S NOT RUNNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUGLAS MacKINNON  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Enough already about Hillary Clinton running for
the Senate in New York. It's never going to happen. Period.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the last few months, I have been the
Washington equivalent of Chicken Little, telling anyone who would
listen that the first lady is not running, never really intended to
run, and in fact will never run for the Senate in New York State.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, my prediction is met with raised eyebrows, blank stares
or shakes of the head that translate into, ``You poor boy. Clearly,
you haven't been reading the papers or watching TV.''
</P>
<P>
   My answer to them is, ``Well, clearly, you haven't been paying
enough attention to what motivates the first lady.'' Because
therein lies the answer as to why she isn't really running for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   My rationale for why Hillary Clinton is pulling one of the great
political scams of recent times is as follows: First, if you look
at it from a purely political prediction standpoint, there is a
very good chance that Rudy Giuliani would not only beat her
decisively, but in fact, embarrass her with the sheer numbers of
his victory.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady is good at adding numbers, does a fairly good job
of reading tea leaves, understands that to a large segment of New
York voters her act is wearing thin and would therefore want no
part of becoming a political joke for David Letterman and Jay Leno
to bat back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Second, if you accept the premise that the first lady cares a
great deal about money (which I do accept), then such a run makes
even less sense. A senator's salary (while great for most
Americans) would be chump-change for Clinton if she decided to
chase the coin of our realm.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three or four years, she could make between $10
and $30 million. Such money would come from a combination of a very
large book advance (which would be astronomical if she gave the
publisher the wink and the nod that she would be willing to dish
dirt on the president), speaking fees, board memberships, stock
options, movie deals, a partnership in a major law firm and various
other ways that one who aspires to real money and happens to be a
controversial former first lady could come up with.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Clinton knows she is young politically, knows that the
next few years are the prime years to cash in on her fame and
understands that it may in fact be better for her to go back to her
home state of Illinois and take on Peter Fitzgerald in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   That way she gets to make the money she aspires to while still
fanning the flame of her presidential ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   So why, you ask, is she perpetrating such an elaborate hoax on
the American people and a somewhat complicit and bored media?
</P>
<P>
   Again, if you begin with the premise that Clinton is nothing if
not Machiavellian, then it all makes sense. One could argue that
she first floated this rumor as a way to deflect attention away
from the president's impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Then, once that threat was behind them, she discovered that she
very much enjoyed the positive attention it brought her. She could
have thought that if she were to try to get into the money game,
then all of this press attention could only serve to drive up her
eventual speaking fees and book advance.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, like a small child who tells a lie about breaking
the lamp, she now cannot quite figure out how to extricate herself
from the fictional campaign web she has spun.
</P>
<P>
   She can offer up any number of plausible excuses not to run.
</P>
<P>
   She can say she decided it's not in the best interest of
Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   She can say the mental stress has gotten to be too much.
</P>
<P>
   Or she can say that, after much soul-searching, she believes
someone like Andrew Cuomo could better serve the people of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what, she will come up with something. I have complete
confidence in her ability to stab the New York Democratic Party in
the back and still come out smelling like a rose as far as the
media are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Nita Lowey and Al Gore may be a bit upset if Clinton pulls a
Houdini in a state so critical to the Democrats in 2000. But she
may well think, ``Well, what are two more angry Democrats added to
the long list of Democrats Bill and I have upset when there is such
a large pot of gold at the end of the disgruntled former first lady
rainbow?''
</P>
<P>
   She's not running.

 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The generic nickname was the giveaway; the Whitby
Seniors' shoestring budget had unraveled. Formerly the Oshawa Smith
Truckmen, they had lost their transport company sponsor for the
1955-56 Ontario Senior B amateur hockey season, and even as they
were skating to their second straight provincial championship, they
were sputtering along on financial fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Wren Blair, the full-time housing appraiser and part-time hockey
impresario who ran the team, couldn't afford to pay the players
their nominal $10-$20 stipend for each game, so he hit upon a
unique solution: If the Seniors would finish out the season, he
would split the year-end revenue among them, on a percentage basis
according to their individual value. All but two of the players
agreed, and at midseason, Blair agonizingly computed the
compensation formula. One by one, he called the players to meet him
at the Spruce Villa hotel, the local hockey hangout in the Lake
Ontario coastal town of some 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Attersley, the Seniors' star center, was at the top of the
scale; he would get 7 percent of the take _ probably some $180 _
Blair informed him. Done.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line was the team's top defenseman. Over a beer in the
lounge, Blair revealed his remuneration: 6 1/2 percent. The
recipient, 24-year-old Harry Sinden, exploded into a rage of
indignation. ``(Expletive) you,'' he told Blair. ``I'm a
7-percenter.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair volleyed with equal vigor. ``(Expletive) you, too,'' he
said. ``As far as I'm concerned, you're worth 6 1/2 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden, who unlike most of his teammates was married with
children _ three young daughters _ got up and stormed toward the
exit. Blair pleaded for him to reconsider. ``For Christ's sake,
Harry,'' he said. ``Half a percent is going to be worth about 8
bucks. What's the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden spun on his heels. ``It's not the half-percent,'' he
advised Blair. ``It's the principle.'' And he walked out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether the battleground is $8 or 8 cents or $8 million, it
always has been a matter of principle to Harry Sinden. And there is
no price he is willing to place on that.
</P>
<P>
   At 67, retirement age for most of his peers, he is in his 28th
season as Bruins general manager, 11th year as team president,
still feisty, still fascinating, always successful by most
standards. He won the Stanley Cup in his fourth and final year as
coach. He guided Team Canada to an earthshaking victory over the
Soviet Union after a two-year hiatus from the game. In the 31 years
he has been in Boston, the Bruins have reached the playoffs 30
times, an unprecedented achievement. And after that lone failure
two years ago, Sinden recast the club on the fly, providing this
fall's FleetCenter patrons with perhaps the most promising Boston
edition since the Big, Bad Bruins of Orr and Esposito and Cheevers.
He has presided over more victories _ 1,148 and counting _ than any
other GM in National Hockey League history. And he has done it all
with a ferocious sense of fiscal responsibility, for the past 25
years on behalf of the Buffalo-based conglomerate Delaware North.
As former scout Bart Bradley says, ``The bottom line is always
black'' for the Black and Gold.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, this last item on the ledger has left Sinden on
the debit side with some critics, as if the Bruins should be a
nonprofit organization, operating as a civic trust. Though it would
be convenient to pass the buck, Sinden emphasizes that he is under
no mandate or budgetary constraints from headquarters, and Delaware
North CEO Jeremy Jacobs corroborates this autonomy. ``The position
he's got, he's earned,'' says Jacobs. ``A number of people who work
for me have great latitude, and Harry's one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden operates by a steadfast, implicit credo: ``Mr. Jacobs
would give up an awful lot to win, but he won't give up his
business. Winning is much more important, but not if you win and
put your team in a position where it can't survive. I want to win _
the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub, because it's not necessarily the most
popular way. The one blank on his resume that Sinden would love to
fill is the lack of a Stanley Cup during his administration.
Detractors point to this, note that the Bruins rank 20th in payroll
(at some $27.5 million) among the 28 NHL teams, inspect the fallout
from notorious contract stalemates he's engaged in over the years _
most recently with All-Star goalie Byron Dafoe, who missed the
first dozen games of the season before signing a three-year, $9.45
million deal last weekend _ and target Sinden as the Cup culprit.
Admirers _ and they are legion outside the ranks of the Players
Association and agents _ applaud him for maintaining a consistent
level of excellence while adhering to sound business principles.
While short-lived dynasties have crumbled under the weight of their
bills, Sinden has overseen five Stanley Cup finalists and constant
contenders. Yet he acknowledges that the lack of the grand prize
feeds into the notion that he is a cheapskate and that bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't duck the public relations flak, refuses to
retreat from a stance that assistant GM Mike O'Connell says has
been arrived at ``through very careful research, a lot of
homework,'' and has earned the grudging admiration of even those in
an adversarial position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry's pay scale is different from the vast majority of
general managers, and he sticks to it,'' says Steve Freyer, agent
for 21-year veteran defenseman Ray Bourque, the most beloved Bruin
of Sinden's tenure who nonetheless endured a traumatic arbitration
process in 1992 that Freyer believes was unnecessary. ``One of
Harry's defining characteristics is that he's a believer. He deeply
believes in his position and he sticks to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been that way, on both sides of the bargaining table,
throughout his life, no matter the cost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was at the pinnacle. After a 29-year famine, and more
recently an eight-year stretch as bottom feeders in the six-team
NHL, the Bruins had captured the 1970 Stanley Cup. There seemed no
horizon to their dominance. With dynamic defenseman Bobby Orr,
scoring metronome Phil Esposito, swashbuckling goaltender Gerry
Cheevers, and a roguish, robust supporting cast, the Big, Bad
Bruins had become the rage of Boston and seemed on the threshold of
becoming the scourge of the now 12-team NHL. And at the helm was
37-year-old Harry Sinden, seemingly about to reap the rewards of a
hardscrabble journey through hockey's hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Bruins were a sublimely talented outfit that
presumably could run on autopilot, the stars themselves exposed the
fallacy of this conventional wisdom. ``Harry Sinden was the best
coach I ever had in pro hockey,'' says Esposito. ``He understood
our team totally. He handled everybody really well. He understood
each player as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his genius,'' says Esposito's fellow center from that
era, Derek Sanderson.
</P>
<P>
   There was one problem. Money. Sinden had received a $15,000
salary when he was promoted to Boston after leading the Bruins'
affiliate in Oklahoma City to the Central Hockey League title in
1966. While on the trail to the Cup, he had received a $2,000
raise, ``so I could go out and get myself some new clothes,'' he
recalls with a laugh. But he had made a discovery that he didn't
find funny: The going rate for an NHL head coach was $30,000. And
during the 1969-70 season, he had received an eye-popping offer
from an old Toronto high school friend, Dave Stirling: a $40,000
salary plus some $1 million in stock options to join the booming
firm of Stirling-Homex, a company based in suburban Rochester,
N.Y., that sold prefabricated housing. He informed Bruins owner
Weston Adams Sr. of the salary discrepancy and was offered a raise
_ to $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd gone to $25,000,'' he says, ``I probably would have
stayed. I didn't want to leave hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   But, with four daughters now to support, he did leave. When he
rejected the Bruins' raise and advised Adams of his business
alternative, the owner told him, ``Have a nice career.''
</P>
<P>
   So less than a week after taking a triumphal ride through the
streets of Boston during the championship parade, Sinden shockingly
announced his retirement. Hearing of this, a stunned Sanderson told
management, ``You just lost the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The divorce didn't last long. Within two years, the bottom fell
out on prefab housing and the company stock, and Sinden lost his
life savings. Having no income, he accepted international hockey
wheeler-dealer Alan Eagleson's invitation to coach the Canadians in
an eight-game exhibition series against the Soviets, with nothing
more than world supremacy at stake in a true Cold War environment.
After they staggered to a 1-2-1 record on their home ice, Sinden
convinced the cocky Canadians of what he already knew from his
participation in the 1960 Olympics: The Russians were for real.
Both chastened and galvanized, Team Maple Leaf salvaged the series
with three one-goal victories in the Soviet Union, and Sinden
parlayed that success into a return to Boston in 1972, this time
strictly as an executive: managing director of hockey. He's been
running the Bruins ever since.
</P>
<P>
   That his break with hockey amounted to little more than a
sabbatical is not what resonates some three decades later. The fact
that he was willing to make it _ a supreme sacrifice for a man who
had grown up wanting nothing more than a life in the game _ speaks
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, his mentor, had learned that day at the Spruce Villa that
Sinden, who took his 6 1/2 percent and finished out the season,
``is a man of principled values.'' In other words, an overriding
sense of duty _ not in pursuit of every possible dollar but for the
sake of his family. That's why his own interests always finished
second.

WHEN THE `WALL OF SHAME' CAME DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They used to tell a joke in West Berlin:
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you going to do when the Wall comes down?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Find a tree and start climbing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Because there won't be any room to stand in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of jokes told on the front lines of the Cold War,
that one contained more than a grain of truth. There really wasn't
any room to stand _ well, not much _ when, on that breathtaking
night 10 years ago this week, the Central Committee of the East
German Communist Party abruptly announced the end of all
restrictions on travel to the west. Almost at once, a flood of East
Berliners came rushing through the gates. By the hundreds of
thousands they came, surging all night long and through the next
day, making their way to the free world on foot, by car _ even by
subway.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight, two new openings were carved out of the heavily
reinforced concrete of the Berlin Wall, and the Jannowitz Bridge
underground station _ sealed off 28 years earlier when the wall
went up _ was hastily reopened. They were still painting the fare
schedule when the crowds came hurtling down the steps for the ride
westward.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 48 hours, more than a million East Germans crossed
over. Many were keen to see the Kurfurstendamm, West Berlin's
glittering shopping boulevard _ a paradise unknown in the drab and
shortage-plagued East. Traffic came to a halt all over the city.
And not only there. At Helmstedt, on the border between the
Germanies, cars were backed up for 40 miles; some drivers waited 11
hours to drive across to the west.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could top the tableaux at the Wall itself. The huge
crowds of weeping, laughing, cheering Berliners, filling every
square foot of what had been a grim no-man's-land just a day
earlier. The exuberant young men and women clambering to the top of
the wall to dance and drink champagne. The welcoming throngs of
West Berliners, pounding with joy on the hood and roof of each
Trabant that came sputtering through the checkpoints. And
everywhere, Germans with chisels and hammers and drills, attacking
the wall in joy and in triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Schandmauer, the Germans called it: wall of shame. It had been,
literally, a monument to evil _ the evil of communism. In the 20th
century, no menace ever proved more deadly. Not even Nazism. The
Nazis murdered millions, but the communists murdered scores of
millions. The Nazis terrorized Europe for seven years; the
communist horror lasted for more than 70 years. No single structure
could encapsulate all that the communists unleashed in Europe, but
the Berlin Wall communicated with perfect clarity communism's
political repugnance: It is a system so hateful that no people
would willingly live under it.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy said it best. ``Freedom has many difficulties
and democracy is not perfect,'' he acknowledged in his 1963 address
in Berlin. ``But we have never had to put a wall up to keep our
people in.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an electrifying speech, but ultimately a hollow one.
Kennedy, overly afraid of triggering a war with the Soviet Union,
had refused to act when the East Germans first began to wall off
the western sectors of Berlin on Aug. 13, 1961. (His response was
to send Vice President Lyndon Johnson on a morale-boosting visit to
West Berlin.) He had no intention of going beyond rhetoric in 1963,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four years later, a different president delivered an
equally electrifying speech at the Berlin Wall. But this was a
president who matched words with action.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall
is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that
remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind,''
declared Ronald Reagan on June 12, 1987. ``General Secretary
Gorbachev, if you seek peace . . . come here to this gate! Mr.
Gorbachev, open this gate! Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't waiting for Gorbachev to accept the invitation. Reagan
had come to office believing that the Cold War could be won by
applying economic, military, and political pressure to the Soviet
Union. In a landmark document _ National Security Decision
Directive 75 _ he had laid out the strategy by which the Soviet
rulers would be forced to their knees.
</P>
<P>
   On every front, he bore down. From rebuilding the US military to
arming freedom fighters in Afghanistan and Central America, from
funding Poland's Solidarity movement to harshly denouncing the
crimes of communism, Reagan fought the Cold War to win. By the time
he stood before Berlin's Brandenburg Gate in 1987, the Kremlin was
under terrible strain and badly demoralized. When the endgame began
in Eastern Europe two years later, Mikhail Gorbachev didn't dare
send in the tanks. The Evil Empire was finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I looked out a moment ago,'' Reagan remarked on that day in
Berlin, ``I noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall,
perhaps by a young Berliner: `This wall will fall. Beliefs become
reality.' Yes, across Europe, this wall will fall. For it cannot
withstand faith; it cannot withstand truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wall cannot withstand freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   For a time it was the planet's most visible, most nauseating,
emblem of tyranny. Today its shards are sold for souvenirs. The
Berlin Wall was massive enough to stop a tank. But, as Reagan
foretold, it could not withstand freedom.

 BOSTON: ... finished second.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riding through Toronto a few years back with Bradley and Bruins
director of development Bob Tindall, Sinden conducted a nostalgic
tour of his boyhood neighborhood in York Township. He stopped in
front of a house and told his passengers, ``That's where I grew
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was almost as long as the house,'' recalls Tindall.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Sinden Sr. was in charge of maintenance at the Ontario
Hydro power plant, ``and we were middle class,'' says Harry Jr.
``Lower middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy shared a second-story bedroom with his grandfather,
Jimmy Sinclair. Every morning at 3, his grandfather would sit at
the edge of his bed smoking a cigarette, ``and he'd wake me up,
too,'' says Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't so bad. It gave the boy more time to play in the
huge park known as Red Square across the street. ``I grew up on the
city streets,'' says Sinden. More accurately, he grew up on the
fields of Red Square, joining hundreds of other kids in whatever
sport was in season. During the winter, the baseball diamonds were
flooded to create three or four rinks, and Sinden would spend the
entire day playing a helter-skelter game of hockey. ``There might
be 100 kids on a rink at one time,'' he says. ``The older kids
would play end to end. The rest of us would play side to side or
corner to corner. You'd have to know who you were playing against
to stay in the right game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden would go home to eat lunch, keeping his skates on while
his mother placed a towel under his feet to protect the floor, then
dash back to the pond until supper time. This was formal dining,
skates prohibited, but Sinden quickly would rejoin the action under
a lone street light and continue playing until the upstairs lights
in his house flashed. ``That was the signal to get your ass home,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   When he could afford it, his father would take him to see the
NHL in action at Maple Leaf Gardens. Otherwise, ``it was the
pastime of every Canadian kid to listen to Maple Leaf games on the
radio,'' says Sinden. ``If they lost, you'd cry yourself to
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Sinden would be playing the game,
developing into a slick, savvy defenseman _ ``like Brian Leetch
today,'' says Tindall _ with two major deficiencies: size (5 feet 9
inches, 180 pounds) and skating ability. Still, ``I never had
hockey off my mind,'' says Sinden. ``I never got it out of my mind
that I was going to be a player someday.''
</P>
<P>
   He was good enough to play at the major junior level, and at 17,
he joined the Oshawa Generals, relocating on his own 32 miles from
Toronto. ``Back then, it was forever,'' he says. ``There were no
throughways. My parents would come to see every home game, but I
was billeted with a family in Oshawa.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same street lived the Brodies, and each day, Sinden would
see their 16-year-old daughter, Eleanor, walking either to school
or her job at the telephone company. ``I wanted to ask her out,''
says Sinden, ``but I was kind of shy, so a buddy of mine did. Then
I said, `I'm going to ask her next.' Nobody else ever asked her
out.''
</P>
<P>
   They were married three years later, and within four years,
Nancy, Carol, and Donna were born; Julie would complete the family
a decade after that.
</P>
<P>
   His junior career finished, he no longer could afford to be a
carefree hockey player with big dreams. His skills were obvious:
``He was a real heady player,'' says Attersley, now a tire magnate
and for 11 years Whitby's mayor. ``When he'd get the puck in our
end, I'd know where to go and he'd put the puck right on my
stick.'' But his drawbacks were evident, too. In an expanded NHL,
he'd have had no problem becoming a mainstay, but the six-team
league had little room for diminutive, slow-footed defensemen.
There was only one minor league _ the American Hockey League _ at
the time, and it was the logical path for players biding their time
for a shot with the Original Six. ``But it also could be the path
to oblivion,'' says Sinden. And stability had become paramount. ``I
had plenty of opportunities to go to the AHL _ Hershey, Cleveland _
but I had to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He opted for the sure thing: employment at the General Motors
plant in Oshawa, where he had begun working as a stationary
engineer at age 19, running the gargantuan coal-driven steam
boilers that powered the tools for the production line. It was
steady work at decent money, and with union protection _ the NHLPA
might not appreciate the irony that Sinden eventually became a shop
steward _ it meant security. So while Sinden says that ``in the
back of your mind, you never give up the idea that you might make
it to the NHL someday,'' practically speaking, he was a full-time
blue-collar worker and part-time world-class amateur hockey player.
Just to keep a skate in the game, he accepted Blair's invitation to
join the Senior B team, and he often would work the graveyard shift
at GM, the team bus dropping him off at the plant's gates after
night games in Belleville or Kingston or Brockville or Cornwall so
he could start feeding the voracious furnaces at 1 a.m. And the
next day, there might be another game three hours away and more
graveyard duty at the end of the trail. But it was worth it to
Sinden, and Blair's boys flourished on the ice. After their
perilous second season, they became the Whitby Dunlops, sponsored
by the tire company, moving up to Senior A and winning the Allan
Cup as Canada's national amateur champions. They represented their
country at Oslo and won the world championship in the spring of
1958, and two years later, Sinden earned a silver medal as Canada
finished second to the upstart United States at the Squaw Valley
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, another minor circuit, the Eastern Professional
Hockey League, had begun play, and the woebegone Bruins intended to
install a team at Kingston, Ontario, with Blair in charge. He
wanted Sinden to go with him, but by now, Blair's best defenseman
was making $5,200 at GM, having risen from fourth- to second-class
engineer at the plant. And while he'd drop by Blair's house and
share a beer while sitting in his car in the driveway after his
shift, family man Sinden couldn't be enticed to make the move.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Blair called Boston GM Lynn Patrick and said, ``I want
to pay Sinden $5,200.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick almost swallowed the phone. ``Just what I need,'' he
barked at Blair. ``A slow 27-year-old defenseman for $5,200.
That'll get us out of last place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says I'm talking about him just as a defenseman?''
retorted Blair. ``You and Milt (Schmidt, the Boston coach) aren't
going to be around forever, and I think this kid has the potential
to take over the Bruins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're going,'' said Patrick, ``I may not be around
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the GM needed no convincing about Sinden's leadership
possibilities. While scouting the Detroit-Toronto playoff series
that spring, he had shared several train rides with Sinden, who was
commuting to play on loan for the Montreal Canadiens' Hull-Ottawa
EPHL team. They had talked a lot of hockey; Patrick had liked what
he heard.
</P>
<P>
   So Sinden became Blair's captain at Kingston for the same money
he was making at GM. There even was a sweetener to the deal. ``They
gave me $2,500 to sign,'' says Sinden. ``That enabled me to get out
of debt.'' It seems the tax man is as relentless north of the
border as here; Revenue Canada was cracking down on the senior
amateur players for not reporting their per diem pittances as
income, and Sinden's toll came to $1,200, which he borrowed from
his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   At last, he was a full-time hockey player at a living wage, but
as a fallback, he took a summer job as an engineer at a Kingston
nylon plant, then began selling real estate. Besides, he knew
playing wasn't his future. ``I never would have made the move from
Oshawa to Kingston,'' says Sinden, ``if I hadn't been interested in
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   In his third year at Kingston, he became a player-coach under
Blair, and the following year, when the EPHL became the CHL and the
Bruins relocated their farm club to Minneapolis, Sinden went behind
the bench full time. Minneapolis gave way to Oklahoma City, and
after his title run there, Sinden was deemed ready to take over the
worst team in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Those penny-pinching days and the Bruins' era of futility now
seem like ancient history. Sinden is entrenched as a seven-figure
executive, ``and that team has been consistent for so long,'' says
Glen Sather, the Edmonton Oilers president-GM who played for Sinden
in Oklahoma City and Boston and now accompanies him on offseason
hunting and fishing retreats in the Canadian wilds. ``It's very
well managed. Those people in Boston have no idea what that team
was like before he took over the reins.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he has spoiled them, because for all the rewards, it
seems the grief never ceases.

BYGONE G'DAYS: AUSTRALIA COOLS TO `MATESHIP' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ADELAIDE, Australia _ It is as Australian as kangaroos and
boomerangs. Around the world, everyone knows ``mateship'' as that
uniquely Down Under brand of friendliness, shared by friends saying
``g'day'' in the outback.
</P>
<P>
   But here, the word ``mateship'' isn't greeted as warmly as it
once was.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the concept of mateship is roiling the country. What
outsiders consider a symbol of Australian good will has become a
lightning rod for ethnic and gender divisions, giving rise to a
wave of national self-analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister John Howard has suggested inserting the word
``mateship'' into the preamble of the Constitution,
enthusiastically promoting it as a vital part of the country's
psyche. Howard wanted voters to approve the matter in a national
referendum _ part of the ballot over the weekend in which
Australians decided to retain the Queen of England as their head of
state.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't even get it on the ballot. While Australians
accomplished the colossal task of defining their relationship with
the crown, they could not settle an equally longstanding and loaded
debate: whom ``mateship'' applies to, and what it stands for.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A ``mate,'' of course, is a friend, and the word is tossed about
freely in Australian slang. Yet to the politically correct, it is a
deeply masculine word, evoking images of beer-swilling sailors and
strapping bush rangers, instead of the country's Aboriginal
population or the thousands of Asian immigrants who populate
Australia's urban centers.
</P>
<P>
   Mateship, likewise, is seen as having strong masculine
overtones. Feminists and minorities deplore it as a code word for
white male bonding and corruption _ a rough equivalent of a good
old boy network in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The myth of mateship, this male clubbiness, may have been
responsible for the exclusion of women from much of Australian
life,'' writer Jeff Corbett said in the Newcastle Herald earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the convict era, mateship has meant different things to
different social groups: bush folk and city laborers; leaders in
politics, business and the professions; outcasts and outlaws;
women, immigrants, Aborigines and artists,'' Axel Clark, an
Australian literature professor at Australian National University,
wrote last month in the Sydney Morning Herald. ``Many Australians
have been made to feel that exclusiveness painfully, while others
have found comfort, strength and faith in mateship.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian soldiers fighting at Gallipoli during World War I
drew strength from mateship, Clark wrote, and public officials have
long benefited from the power their mates provide. It has even
translated into a political ideology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some left-wing Aussie optimists liked to say that `socialism
is just being mates,' '' Clark wrote. ``They treasured the idea
that `the doctrine of mateship' represented a radical solution to
the problems of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Howard, however, the doctrine of mateship brought no such
glory. He introduced the idea of including it in the Constitution's
preamble in March, when officials were also debating whether to use
the word ``kinship'' or ``custodianship'' to describe indigenous
peoples' relationship with the land.
</P>
<P>
   But mateship was the most important addition, Howard said at the
time, describing it as ``the one word in all of this which is
unarguably, distinctively, and grammatically and proudly
Australian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't find it in any other preamble,'' Howard said.
``I'm not surprised that that's attracted a lot of attention. It is
the most unambiguously, passionate, unmistakable Australian word,
and it conjures up whole lots of things about our way of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics vehemently disagreed, however, and the Australian
Democratic Party launched a campaign to get the word dropped from
the proposal. It took only days for Howard to cave in to the
pressure. He did so, he said, in order to get the other changes to
the preamble made.
</P>
<P>
   ``To pass up that opportunity simply because I couldn't get my
way on one particular word would have been the wrong thing to have
done,'' he said. Still, he added: ``I have to say I'm very sorry
about that, very sorry indeed.''

STRANGELY LIST OF TOP 100 SOUTHERNERS INCLUDES MANY NORTHERNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The South has had to put up with a lot of cruel and unfunny
stereotypes _ that Southerners are slow, parochial, too steeped in
the past, too territorial, not really aware of how the world works.
Truth is, Southerners are sharp and hardy and can carry America's
banner as well as any other part of the country.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, should we make of the list of this century's 100
most influential Southerners, as voted by the readers of the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution? In one way it's just another bag of
big names, another bogus Millennium List that begs to be
second-guessed. But in another way it's downright grotesque _ turns
out you don't even have to be a Southerner to make it.
</P>
<P>
   The daily Journal-Constitution included ballots with 200 names,
plus space for write-ins, and made a Web site available.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people voted. When it ran the results of the
survey at the end of last month, the newspaper described the list
as ``an eclectic group, dominated by popular culture figures . . .
and they're not all Southerners.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are half a dozen non-Southerners on the list,
including the Wright brothers, Walt Disney, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
Earl Warren and ``the Rockefeller Foundation,'' which received 589
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King Jr. finished as the most influential
Southerner of the century. No argument there. But No. 2 is Wilbur
and Orville Wright, who were born and raised in Ohio and Indiana _
their closest touch to the South coming on that short flight at
Kitty Hawk, N.C., on Dec. 17, 1903.
</P>
<P>
   No. 3 is Jimmy Carter, arguably not half the president Woodrow
Wilson, another Southerner, was. But Woodrow Wilson is voted in at
No. 41 _ two spots below Rosalyn Carter. Bill Clinton? He's at No.
48, sandwiched between Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, exactly
twice as far down the list as No. 24, the mythical figure of Col.
Sanders, chicken king.
</P>
<P>
   The top 10 is rounded out by Ted Turner at No. 4, evangelist
Billy Graham, George Washington Carver, Sam Walton (founder of
Wal-Mart), Louis Armstrong, Henry Aaron and Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   Presley pushed to the end of a line behind Carter, Graham and
Walton? Hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The most egregious choices on the list are in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   William Faulkner, the South's preeminent 20th century author,
comes in behind Douglas MacArthur (11), Margaret Mitchell (16) and
Michael Jordan (17). The humor columnist Lewis Grizzard is 26th _
51 spots ahead of Southern literary icon Thomas Wolfe.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby Foote, whose Civil War trilogy is the best yet written,
doesn't make the list. Neither does James Dickey, Robert Penn
Warren or Richard Wright. But John Grisham does. Pat Conroy does.
</P>
<P>
   MacArthur, Chester Nimitz (54) and William Westmoreland (74) are
there, but not John J. Pershing or George Patton, who was born in
San Gabriel but raised in the South, son of a famous Virginia
family. Oprah Winfrey's at No. 28 and Andy Griffith makes the list
at No. 30 _ ahead of Arthur Ashe, Bear Bryant, Hank Williams,
Willie Mays, Andrew Young and Lyndon Johnson. Andy Griffith ...
</P>
<P>
   Some things on the list just make you smile. Justice Hugo Black
finishes at No. 84, behind Gladys Knight (without the Pips) and
Little Richard. Even in their hometown, the Braves _ the
millennium's bridesmaids of baseball _ don't make the list. And
right in the middle there's a crazy quilt of Southerners in the
space of 10 names: Joe Louis, Mahalia Jackson, Bobby Jones, Patsy
Cline, George Wallace and James Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee is there (No. 90), but not D.W. Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Loretta Lynn makes it, but not W.C. Handy, Billie Holiday,
Bessie Smith or Bob Wills.
</P>
<P>
   Foodies Paul Prudhomme and Justin Wilson are among the 100.
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich makes it at No. 61, but Sam Rayburn _ the Speaker
of the House in this century _ does not. Neither does Huey Long,
populist king of America, a political figure strong enough to scare
FDR.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Journal-Constitution list is as forgettable as
all the other millennium lists. But it does have that intriguing
difference _ that you don't have to be a Southerner to make it.
Kind of opens things up, doesn't it? Most influential Irish of the
millennium _ Mao Tse Tung, Joseph Stalin, Margaret Thatcher. Most
influential gays? The sky's the limit.

 GORE, BRADLEY HEALTH PLANS: ONE PROBLEM, TWO SOLUTIONS
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation's rocketing economy has produced 9.5
million jobs in the last four years and raised wages for even the
lowest-paid workers. But as Americans buy more homes, cars and
other consumer goods, the number buying one important staple _
health insurance _ has not budged.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 44 million Americans without insurance are taking a
prominent place in the national spotlight, thanks to the Democratic
presidential primary. And in Vice President Al Gore and former
senator Bill Bradley, the nation has a chance to sort out how far
it is willing to go, if at all, toward promising health care for
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   In proposals issued recently, both Democratic candidates have
promised to cover all 11 million children who have no insurance,
with taxpayers paying the entire cost for the poor and many
near-poor. Gore and Bradley would also give substantial help to the
parents of the nation's poorest children.
</P>
<P>
   But they split over one growing class of people: the millions of
adults who are not quite poor, but who find insurance so expensive
that they do not buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 17 percent of full-time workers have no insurance, often
because employers do not offer it or have shifted costs to
employees. Many of the new jobs created in the current boom are at
small businesses, which are less likely to offer coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that when you're considered working poor, the options
aren't there for you,'' said Juanita Turner, a Worcester mental
health worker and mother of a 17-year-old daughter. Her union
recently went on strike when her employer tried to shift some
insurance costs to workers, a move that Turner said would force
many people to go without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Such workers sit on the fault line between Bradley and Gore:
Bradley has proposed an expansive plan that helps people even
further up the economic ladder than Turner _ and which carries an
expansive pricetag to match. Gore, by contrast, would spend money
on the poorest and near-poor while offering only limited help to
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say if you want to fill a cup, you start at the bottom,''
said Jonathan Gruber, an economics professor and health policy
specialist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``The
question is: How high do you want to fill the cup?''
</P>
<P>
   The question has barely been raised among the Republican
presidential contenders. But it has sparked the sharpest debate yet
in the Democratic campaign, and polls show that voters are likely
to make it a general election issue. With surveys suggesting that
no candidate can win the Democratic nomination without a strong
health plan, Bradley boasts that he is proposing a big idea to
attack a big problem. He has derided Gore's plan as ``definitely
timid.''
</P>
<P>
   The tactic has helped raise Bradley's profile among Democrats,
said Robert Blendon, a professor of health policy at Harvard who
studies public opinion. If nothing else, it has put the word
``bold'' next to Bradley's name in headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, talks freely of his plan's limitations, and
his staff uses the word ``incremental'' to describe it. They say
Bradley's plan is too expensive and would divert dollars from other
purposes, such as shoring up Medicare. ``Alchemy was a big idea,
but it wasn't a good idea,'' Gore said at a recent campaign event.
</P>
<P>
   The true cost of the two plans is open to debate. Bradley says
he would spend up to $650 billion over 10 years to insure as many
as 39 million more people. Gore says he would spend $264 billion
over 10 years to cover as many as 15 million more people, mostly
children and parents of low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau says that 44.2 million people, or 16.3 percent
of Americans, are uninsured today.
</P>
<P>
   Several independent analysts said the candidates have lowballed
their cost estimates. Moreover, both candidates would draw money
from the federal budget surplus and might have to scale down their
ambitions if the surplus did not materialize.
</P>
<P>
   But a health plan's odds of success are measured in more than
money. Five years ago, after a furious national debate, lawmakers
shot down President Clinton's massive proposal to insure all
Americans. Bradley's plan falls far short of what Clinton would
have done, avoiding price controls and other intrusions into the
private market. But it is ambitious, and it may antagonize people
who fear big changes.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic move, Bradley would eliminate Medicaid, the
federal-state program for 36 million poor and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, he would give money to low-income people to buy
their own insurance. Because individuals often pay high premiums
when they buy insurance alone, Bradley would allow the public to
buy into the federal government's insurance system, the Federal
Employees Health Benefits Program. The program offers a range of
private plans, and it already serves 9 million federal workers,
including members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would also order parents to buy coverage for their
children, but it is unclear how this would be enforced. Aides said
that hospitals would make sure that children are enrolled in a plan
at birth, and that schools, day-care centers, doctors and others
could find children who somehow fall through the cracks. But they
assume that the subsidies offered under the plan are high enough so
that every parent wants to buy insurance and can afford it, a point
that others dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, by contrast, avoids big changes to the health delivery
system and expands programs that already exist.
</P>
<P>
   By raising the income cut-offs, Gore would make 1 million more
children eligible for Medicaid and a relatively new federal-state
program called the Children's Health Insurance Program, or CHIP. At
higher income levels, parents could buy their children into
Medicaid or CHIP at what Gore aides say would be modest premiums.
</P>
<P>
   The most substantive change in Gore's plan is to tell parents
that if their children are eligible for Medicaid or CHIP, the
parents are, as well. Gore aides say this would insure 7 million
more adults while giving an extra nudge to parents who have failed
to enroll their children in programs for which they already
qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Gore would offer a modest subsidy to adults with no children and
to people age 55-65, who often have trouble buying insurance
because of their age. Both plans add optional coverage for
prescription drugs to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the debate here is just how expansive you want to
be,'' said David Cutler, a Harvard University economist and
informal adviser to the Bradley camp. ``The Bradley plan moves
closer to universal coverage than the Gore plan. It's also more
expensive. Nothing in life is free.''
</P>
<P>
   But some things in life are more expensive than others, and
Bradley is more willing than Gore to pay the price.
</P>
<P>
   Children consume few health services and are relatively
inexpensive to insure. So are the poorest adults, because in
subsidizing them the government offers aid to relatively few people
who already have insurance on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Gore focuses on these groups, where the government gets ``real
high bang for the buck,'' said Gruber of MIT.
</P>
<P>
   But as a plan reaches further up the income scale, Gruber said,
it spends more to cover each uninsured person. That is because many
more people in the upper classes already have insurance, and it is
hard to avoid offering them a subsidy while helping people in the
same income class who do not have their own coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Cutler noted that the Bradley plan subsidizes people who already
have insurance, but he said that makes for good public policy. In
essense, he said, Bradley is offering a ``well-targeted tax cut''
in the form of the subsidy to low-income people who have reached
deep in their pockets to pay for a health policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say, `Gee, you valued health insurance and were
willing to take $5,000 of your family's $25,000 income to pay for
it, and in exchange for that we'll give a subsidy only to someone
else,' '' Cutler said.
</P>
<P>
   This is what makes the Bradley plan so expensive, said Kenneth
Thorpe, a professor of health policy at Emory University in
Atlanta. ``Two-thirds of the spending goes to people who already
have insurance,'' Thorpe said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore, on the other hand, risks leaving more poor and
near-poor children uninsured, either because they are ineligible or
because parents will fail to enroll them, Gruber said. ``Bradley
has very few poor people falling through the cracks of the system,
but it is very expensive,'' Gruber said.
</P>
<P>
   The effects of eliminating Medicaid are unclear. In its place,
Bradley would pay $1,200 for each child to buy a private policy and
up to $1,800 for an adult, depending on income. No family would
receive more than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   This means Medicaid beneficiaries would trade guaranteed health
coverage for $1,800 that may or may not be enough to buy a private
plan. Depending on the state, Medicaid offers no or low copayments
for doctor visits and medication, and sometimes free dental or eye
care.
</P>
<P>
   According to Thorpe, the least expensive plan available in
Boston under the federal employees' system costs $2,272, or $472
more than Bradley's subsidy. Faced with the new cost, some Medicaid
beneficiaries would choose to go without insurance, Thorpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the broad ambition of the plans, some people fault Gore
and Bradley for failing to control health care costs, which might
free money that could be put toward more care. Moreover, the plans
generally keep the workplace as the primary place to buy insurance,
which is difficult to people who switch jobs, work part-time or do
not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend more than anyone in the world on health, but the
money is going to the wrong place, to 27 health insurance companies
that have different systems,'' said Celia Wcislo, president of
Local 285 of the Service Employees International Union.

CAN LATIN MUSIC KEEP THE HEAT? 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ When newly minted teen star Christina Aguilera decided
to record a Spanish-language version of her smash hit ``Genie in a
Bottle,'' she didn't hop a limo to a state-of-the art recording
studio in New York or LA. Instead Aguilera _ who is half Ecuadorean
and grew up outside of Pittsburgh _ traveled to South Florida, to
record at producer Rudy Perez's home studio in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tiny room, really, just off the swimming pool, with
enough space for a love seat and a few potted plants. Perez's four
sons have the run of the place, and the family dog pokes his nose
in whenever he pleases. The casual ambience, however, is deceiving.
Perez, the son of Cuban immigrants, is a 20-year veteran who has
written and produced music for virtually every major Latin artist,
from Julio Iglesias and Jose Feliciano to Mexican pop star Cristian
and salsa sensation Marc Anthony to up-and-comers Millie and Jaci
Velasquez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is producing a full-length album for Aguilera. Her reverse
crossover, from English to Spanish, is a sign of just how
entrenched Latin music has become in the US mainstream. Far from a
novelty, the so-called Latin Explosion mirrors an exploding
generation of Latin American music fans _ kids and young adults who
are not just bilingual but thoroughly bicultural. It's a generation
that grew up immersed in pop, rock, and hip-hop, but who also heard
traditional music in their parents' and grandparents' homes. And as
the multitudes of Latin musical styles begin to merge into the US
mainstream, Miami is emerging as the epicenter of Latin music. It's
a city with unique potential, but also one that's suffering from
the problems that accompany tremendous growth. Not least among
them, of course, is the question of whether that growth is going to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its geographical and cultural proximity to Latin
America, Miami is ground zero for artists, producers, and record
labels. All six major multinational labels _ Sony, EMI, Polygram,
WEA, Universal, and BMG _ have their Latin music headquarters
there; so do publishing titans BMI and ASCAP. LARAS, the newly
established Latin arm of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences, is based in Miami, busily preparing for the first Latin
Grammy Awards show, to be broadcast next September.
</P>
<P>
   The real action, though, is happening on tony North Bay Road, a
quiet swath of upscale homes that face Biscayne Bay on Miami
Beach's North Shore. The street has become something of an enclave
in the last few years. With the exception of Emilio Estefan _
Gloria's husband and the unofficial godfather of Latin &UR;  &LR; pop music,
whose massive white villa sits on a private residential island just
across the bay _ Latin music's movers and shakers have flocked to
this quiet neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   It's where Perez lives and works. Just up the street is the home
and studio of Kike Santander, who arrived in Miami from Colombia
five years ago, promptly composed an album for Gloria Estefan, and
has gone on to write and produce songs for Thalia, Jon Secada,
Alejandro Fernandez, Carlos Ponce, Los Tri-O, and the young
Argentine folk/pop singer Soledad. A few doors down is Desmond
Child, former rock singer turned hitmaker (he penned ``Dude Looks
Like a Lady'' for Aerosmith, ``You Give Love a Bad Name'' for Bon
Jovi, and songs for Cher, Hanson, Alice Cooper, and Kiss). Child,
who's half-Cuban, returned five years ago to his hometown of Miami,
where he wrote and produced ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' and much of the
rest of Ricky Martin's crossover album. He shuttles back and forth
between home and his studio, a few blocks away, in a gold golf
cart. Conveniently, Martin's digs are just down the road. And
Jennifer Lopez was spotted touring a house for sale, catty-corner
from Perez's, just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, the question on everyone's mind is: Can Latin music
sustain the incredible trajectory of the last eight months? Such
heavily hyped trends are generally as brief as they are lucrative.
But Latin music's roots stretch much farther and much deeper than
the current chart-topping crossover stars. As cover stories
heralding the latest craze disappear from newsstands, as Ricky
Martin's new single begins to slip on the charts, one wonders if
names like Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, and Enrique Iglesias _ all
of whom are topping the Billboard charts _ will disappear from the
pop radar. Or is Latin music assuming its rightful place in the
mainstream US market?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boom this year (according to SoundScan, Latin music
sales for the first half of 1999 soared nearly 54 percent over the
same period in 1998), ``the whole Latin market in the US right now
is totally virgin,'' says Perez, an amiable, boyish 40-year-old
whose home office is lined ceiling to floor with gold and platinum
records. ``Even though it's very successful, 90 percent of the
artists are exports _ from Mexico, from Colombia. We haven't begun
to touch the artists who are here. My target will be to go into the
barrios in the Bronx, in South Central LA, and find the kids from
here who have parents who are Latin, but who have the American
culture. That's what we're going to see a lot more of.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez has demographics on his side. Fueled by massive
immigration and high birthrates, the US Latino population has grown
38 percent since 1990, to 31 million. The overall population, by
contrast, has grown just 9 percent. With more than a third of the
Latino population under 18, the boom has just begun. By the year
2005, it's predicted, Latinos will be the largest minority group in
the country, and by 2050, nearly a quarter of the population will
be Latino.
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, Perez has started the ball rolling. He
discovered a talented young singer who goes by the name Lazz
participating in a music program at a Miami high school, and
offered to produce demos for her. Lazz released her debut salsa
album on Warner Brothers International this past June, and is
planning a crossover R &AMP; B release for sometime next year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lack of live music &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Lazz, unfortunately, is an exception here. Vibrant as
Miami's cultural and musical landscape is, the city's live music
scene is practically nonexistent. Artists who record here generally
come from somewhere else. Many of South Florida's live music venues
have closed in the last few years. Two nights trolling for music
revealed that most clubs now boast velvet ropes and DJs rather than
bands. Cafe Nostalgia, a small storefront club on Southwest Eighth
Street in Little Havana _ a local hangout for musicians like Ruben
Blades and Bono _ is one of the few left, and it's a gem. This is a
problem that will have to be resolved, says Desmond Child, if Miami
hopes to become an industry hub on a par with Los Angeles, New
York, and Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming into record companies already developed from
other regions,'' says Child, who recently established his own
Miami-based label, Destin Records. ``So then it's all corporate.
Everybody's already in their own world, and there's no feeling or
desire to cross-pollinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Infrastructure is a problem, too. There are only half a dozen
world-class recording studios in the area _ barely enough to keep
up with the increasing demand. Miami's music community is also
short on support personnel: managers, marketing executives, and PR
people.

REVIEWING WRITERS WHO NEED NONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBIN W. WINKS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking at mystery reviews in the press these days, a reader
might easily get the impression that the writers of the big
blockbusters are no longer at work. Perhaps the commendable (I
think) wish to introduce readers to lesser-known writers, or to
help give a first-time novelist a bit of a boost, plays a role in
this. Certainly, I am sure, the thought that the big names hardly
need the help of a review, and that their fans require no guidance,
since the books will sell in the many thousands whatever a critic
may say, is behind some of this silence. When the best-known
writers are discussed, gossip is often the main purpose: Is it true
that Dick Francis's wife, Mary, actually writes his books? That P.
D. James works out her repressions through Cordelia Gray? Such
speculation often is to the neglect of the books themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The simplest answer, I believe, is that the blockbuster writers
are both so good at what they do, and (having established
themselves at the top of a very greasy pole) so cautious about
changing their formulas, that they tend to be quite predictable,
which leads any reviewer toward silence. This month I thought I
would resist that silence and see what some of the Big Guns are up
to.
</P>
<P>
   Robert B. Parker is definitely a Big Gun, and deservedly so. In
``Family Honor'' (Putnam, $22.95), he introduces his first female
private eye. Sunny Randall is a former cop, a college graduate,
divorced, trying to be a painter, and every bit as understanding as
Spenser when it comes to confused teenagers who are a pain in the
neck. She is a more fully realized person than Parker's other
recent creation, Jesse Stone, but they have in common with Spenser
a laconic style, ability to defend themselves when driven to the
wall, and an attraction to Boston and its environs. Sunny Randall
is hired by a wealthy and very unpleasant set of parents to find
their daughter, apparently a runaway. This is quickly done, and
then comes the harder part: Should this vulnerable, hard-edged
child be returned to her parents at all? Parker handles the
slippery emotions well, and if Randall sounds just like Spenser
with a gender change, there is no reason for surprise or regret.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Grafton is another of the Dependables, and ``O Is For
Outlaw'' (Holt, $26) is precisely what one has come to expect.
Kinsey Milhone returns for her 15th ``adventure,'' as the dust
jacket tells us with unaccustomed honesty (any element of
``mystery,'' in the sense of having to unravel clues, has been
missing from the Grafton novels for some time). In this one we
learn much more about Kinsey's earlier life, her first marriage,
and what she was like in 1967, when she graduated from high school.
The action takes place in 1986 _ Grafton obviously has to slow the
calendar down if she has any hopes of keeping Kinsey out of a
wheelchair until ``Z'' is for zero, and this adds to the
attraction. I do wish Grafton wouldn't pad her books, though: ``I
turned right onto Hilgard, right again on Le Conte, and right onto
Tiverton where I paid for a parking voucher.'' Who cares?
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Woods has long since entered into the land of the
Biggies, and ``Worst Fears Realized'' (HarperCollins, $25) displays
his strengths and weaknesses perfectly. He tells a terrific yarn,
unadorned and straight ahead. His sentences, though, are
flat-footed and suffer from Harold Robbinsitis _ which is to say, a
kind of reverse gush. These are page-turners in the truest sense of
the word. Here we encounter Stone Barrington again _ he's a
handsome, omni-competent New York lawyer with attitude who moves
among the beautiful people _ and this time someone is killing all
the women in his life, improbably, melodramatically, quickly. Woods
is one of those writers whose figures become simply bodies, sex
dolls, mouthpieces for a social attitude. He makes one long for
John D. MacDonald, but one keeps reading him and his books keep
selling, for John D. is dead, alas.
</P>
<P>
   So is Agatha Christie, but Charles Osborne is trying to
resuscitate her. In 1998 he released ``Black Coffee,'' his
rewriting of a Christie play into a novel, and it worked quite well
and received much praise (including mine). Now he gives us ``The
Unexpected Guest'' (St. Martin's, $23.95), based on a 1958 Christie
play that had a 16-month run in a London theater. Osborne has made
an unfortunate choice for his second pastiche, for the central
puzzle of the play does not translate at all well into straight
prose, and any self-respecting reader will have nearly everything
figured out by Page 38. To go on reading in the hope that it can't
be this simple, and then to discover that it is, leads to
disappointment. Perhaps this should be the last of these revivals.
</P>
<P>
   I close with a brace of true revivals. In 1958 and 1959, in the
fading days of the British Empire, M. M. Kaye published two
mysteries that are now republished by St. Martin's as ``Death in
Kenya'' and ``Death in Zanzibar'' (both $12.95, paperback). Kaye
went on to write enormously popular books, including ``The Far
Pavilions.'' It is good to have these two mysteries back, for they
are well-constructed novels about life in colonial settings now
long gone, a life Kaye knew at first hand. The reader can feel the
heat, and the racial and sexual antagonisms _ for they are the real
thing, no pastiche.

<TEXT>
<P>
   George Mallory is to mountaineering what Amelia Earhart is to
aviation. Both were young, attractive, and well-known adventurers
who disappeared while attempting historic record-breaking feats.
Earhart's remains, of course, have never been found, but the body
of Mallory, eerily preserved in the deep-freeze time capsule of
Mount Everest, was discovered in May by members of the 1999 Mallory
&AMP; Irvine Research Expedition. The startling find, which made
international headlines, has spawned two books from the search
team's members, and prompted the authors of another book already in
the works about Mallory's Everest expeditions to include the
updated information.
</P>
<P>
   What none of these books do is answer mountaineering's biggest
mystery: Did Mallory and his climbing partner Andrew Irvine reach
the summit of the world's highest mountain on June 8, 1924? Such a
feat would have made them the first, but without proof positive,
that distinction goes to Edmund Hillary and sherpa Tenzing Norgay
29 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Each book, relying on if-then scenarios, presents several
educated guesses about what happened. The one thing learned in May
is that Mallory died in a fall while roped to Irvine. The summit
question will never be answered unless the camera the two men were
carrying is found, the film is preserved, and a photo shows the two
at the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghosts of Everest,'' by expedition members, Jochen Hemmleb,
Larry Johnson, and Eric Simonson as told to writer William
Nothdurft, focuses as much on the entire project as on finding
Mallory's body. Hemmleb, 27, was the team's historian and trip
originator. He and Johnson, a climber and marketer of outdoor
books, met over the Internet and they asked Simonson, a top-notch
Himalaya expedition organizer, to serve as leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ghosts of Everest'' alternates between the unfolding of both
the 1999 and the 1924 expeditions, and both stories are riveting.
There are common themes: the climbers' passion, extraordinary
physical demands, mind-boggling logistics, and a constant need for
media and money to get trips off the ground. The firsthand account
of the five men who examined Mallory's remains is powerful reading,
and you know they will be forever changed by the discovery. ``We
weren't just looking at a body,'' said team member Dave Hahn. ``We
were looking at an era, one we'd only known through books.''
</P>
<P>
   The book contains astonishing photographs that include
breathtaking scenery, 1924 artifacts, climbing shots from both
trips, and bone-chilling photographs of Mallory's body on the day
it was found. What is missing from ``Ghosts of Everest'' is much of
the controversy that came from publishing and even selling those
photos of Mallory, and any serious pondering about the real-time
media coverage.
</P>
<P>
   A fascinating facet of the 1999 expedition was the reliance on
the media, and ``The Lost Explorer'' discusses that. The book is
coauthored by world-class mountaineer Conrad Anker, who was the
strongest climber on the trip and the person who found Mallory's
body; and David Roberts, a Cambridge, Mass. outdoors writer and
mountaineer. Hemmleb and crew were in many ways at the mercy of the
BBC and WGBH/NOVA, with whom they'd struck filming deals, and
mountaineering Internet site MountainZone.com, another backer. Team
members filed reports over the Web site daily _ and it received a
million hits a day for two weeks after Mallory's body was found.
</P>
<P>
   Although Anker's occasional criticism of his expedition and
teammates seems gratuitous, his first-person narrative, in contrast
to the third-person in ``Ghosts,'' is even more immediate and
gripping, particularly when writing about finding Mallory and his
subsequent summit of Everest. What ``The Lost Explorer'' sorely
lacks, however, is photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Much is made of whether the Second Step, a steep incline on the
way up, can be climbed without aid (it now has a ladder and ropes).
If not, then Mallory and Irvine could not have made it to the top.
``Ghosts'' says ``it most certainly can'' because Anker climbed it.
Anker, who compromised his free climb (without aid) by resting on a
ladder rung, disputes that in ``The Lost Explorer.'' Not only is
Anker convinced that Mallory and Irvine couldn't have climbed it,
he is unequivocal in his belief they could never have descended it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Climb,'' by photographer and climber David Breashears of
Boston and preeminent Mallory historian Audrey Salkeld, is mostly
an account of Mallory's Everest expeditions but includes
information on the May discovery. It, too, is beautifully designed
and includes splendid artwork of Everest and climbers old and new.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last Climb'' echoes the other two books and every expedition
member's sentiments when it says: ``Although Mallory and Irvine
perished for their dream, they showed the way, and helped us
understand both the tug of Everest, and the indomitable nature of
the human spirit. Their achievement is so much greater than our
need to know whether or not they climbed to the top.''

   There is no simple label to place on the man or his reign.
Perhaps because of the disheveled look he presents after an evening
of intensive inspection of the product on the ice from his skybox
perch at the FleetCenter _ ``as if he just played the game,'' says
Sanderson _ and his often intransigent negotiating, Sinden is
caricatured as a rough-and-ready street brawler. That is as
inaccurate as it is simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden is a gourmet cook _ ``Well, I cook gourmet food,
anyway,'' he says with a laugh. ``I started it when I was coaching
because I found it relaxes me.'' He is a ravenous reader with a
preference for history who can expound on Churchill as readily as
he does the neutral zone trap. ``He's very complicated in many
ways,'' says Mark Witkin, agent for Bruins defenseman Don Sweeney,
among others. ``He's much more sophisticated than people would
think. He's a very intelligent man who can be gracious, and you can
learn a lot from him on a ton of subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   And, contrary to his bulldog reputation, he is a doer of good
deeds, though he prefers that they be kept below the radar. Sather
remembers being a lonely 20-year-old in Oklahoma City who was
invited to Christmas dinner by his coach, thus triggering a
lifelong friendship. Bruins senior assistant to the president Nate
Greenberg says Sinden regularly donates his speaking fees to
charity _ with the proviso that there be no publicity. Mark
Perrone, a former agent who represented Cam Neely, recalls that
when the Bruins star's father died of cancer, two people came to
his home in the middle of the night to console him: Perrone and
Sinden. He expressed similar sorrow when former loose-cannon Bruins
coach Don Cherry's wife, Rose, died; in the process, Sinden put
aside the fact that Cherry, now Canada's foremost TV-radio hockey
personality, had made him an object of ridicule ever since the
five-year relationship between GM and coach degenerated into a
blood feud before Cherry left in 1979. Cherry now says, ``I owe
everything I have to Harry Sinden.'' And Islanders GM Mike Milbury,
who served under Sinden as player, coach, and assistant GM, says,
``He's a good-hearted man. I won't even begin to list the number of
players he's helped with their lives after hockey. There's a
thousand of them. Just look at how many ex-Bruins wind up working
for the team in some capacity.'' Sometimes it goes beyond that.
Sanderson, now a successful businessman whose career was curtailed
by substance abuse, is forever grateful to Sinden for paying out of
his own pocket for part of his ex-player's hip replacements. ``And
he gave me the TV analyst's job early in my sobriety,'' says
Sanderson. ``He took a chance on me. He didn't have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden's reputation at ice level is no less glossy. Through the
years, the Toronto street kid with the high school diploma and the
engineer's license has developed into perhaps hockey's most
eloquent spokesman. ``At the league level,'' says former Islanders
GM and current Florida Panthers president Bill Torrey, ``he's tried
to put the good of the game right at the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheevers, now a Bruins scout, considers his boss ``the best
hockey guy I've been around, one of the few guys I've seen who
could coach in 1968 and 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it seems that recently, all that has been overshadowed by
the contract confrontations _ such as with Jason Allison, Anson
Carter, and Kyle McLaren last season, and Dafoe this year. And
there is a hornet's nest looming next summer, when the contracts of
Bourque, Allison, Sweeney, Carter, Dave Andreychuk, Joe Thornton,
and Sergei Samsonov, among others, expire. ``It's a lot of work,''
acknowledges Sinden. ``As always, we'll tinker with it, do what we
can, but we can only go so far.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, as O'Connell says, ``We'll meet the market but
we won't set new markets.'' Meanwhile, Sinden looks at the
extravagant Rangers, who are paying a league-high $59 million for a
team that missed the playoffs last season, and warns, ``If we all
did business like New York, we'd all lose $40 million-$50
million.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what the players and agents want to hear. Perrone
speaks for the minority when he says, ``I regard him as a true
purist, a guardian of the game, who carries the banner for the
traditionalists day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   Others believe Sinden's interpretation of tradition has become
tiresome. Allison, whose 1998-99 season began with a contract
hassle and ended with Sinden criticizing him for poor play in Game
6 of the second playoff round when the Bruins were eliminated at
Buffalo, won't discuss his boss. And Witkin says, ``If there's one
thing I could change, it's the specter of money that always
overhangs the team. I wish it wasn't so predominant.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who held out for 15 games last season, claims that
around the league, ``a lot of players I talk to think Boston is a
great city but don't want to play for Harry. That's the reputation
he's got. When I came here from Washington, I was surprised the
first time I met him to find out he was a regular guy. I thought he
was going to be the Grinch or something.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Carter acknowledges what Sinden always has maintained:
It's nothing personal. ``He's a nice man,'' says Carter. ``I try to
tell that to other guys. The negotiations are just something you
have to go through every couple of years, like a rite of passage.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a basic philosophy, and Sinden won't budge from it.
Dafoe, who was seeking a raise to $4 million from $850,000 and
eventually dimissed his agent, Ron Salcer, recalls, ``Harry told me
at one point, `It would be easy for me to give you $3.5 million,
considering the beating I'm taking from the public and press. But I
just don't think it's right.' What can I say? You have to respect
him for that. I think he thought he was being fair with me. And
after it was over, he talked to me for a half-hour and cleared the
air. I appreciated that.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if the players are at the poverty level.
``There's a lot of healthy contracts around here,'' says Bourque,
who in the wake of losing his arbitration case signed a five-year,
$12.5 million contract that made him the highest-paid Bruin at the
time. ``There's a reason for that _ because Harry's so good at his
job.''
</P>
<P>
   His sheer longevity in that job, given its massive headaches and
burnout quotient, defies logic. Tom Johnson, recently retired as
Sinden's longtime lieutenant, takes a stab at explaining it. ``The
challenge,'' he says. ``The rules and regulations of the game, the
free agency and contracts _ he thrives on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others marvel that he can stomach it. ``Although he keeps saying
he wants to go and he deserves that time, can he cut the cord?''
says current coach Pat Burns. ``As a friend, I'd like to see him do
it. As a coach, I don't want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sinden may be getting ready for a gradually reduced
role. He says he'd like to stay on for another five years but hints
that this may be his last as GM. ``It's definitely on my agenda,''
he says. In fact, he was ready to become exclusively club president
three years ago, but he thought that would be taking the easy way
out. The Bruins' three-decade playoff run had just ended, ``and I
didn't want to look like I was walking out'' on the mess.
</P>
<P>
   His heir apparent, O'Connell, is handling more of the daily
chores but isn't eager to let Sinden head into the sunset.
``Everything that comes up, I want to include him,'' says
O'Connell, ``because he has such good insights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden realizes that's subject to debate; it's the nature of the
beast. ``But I'm still doing it,'' he says, ``so I must enjoy it,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   That's the bottom line.

CHILDREN, TOO, NEED PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN MCNAMARA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is it any wonder that adults are such a vexation to children? We
refuse to grant them the simple dignity of their own interior
lives.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough that we structure their every hour between
waking and sleeping, that we insist on ``supervised'' play and
``organized'' sports, that we censor their musical selections and
monitor their television viewing. Now we insist on vetting their
imaginations, too.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Potter is the latest target of misguided parental angst.
Forget Marilyn Manson and the video game ``Doom.'' Those are
yesterday's demons. Today we fear the stories of sorcerers that are
being scooped up by pre-adolescents, the tales of wizards that are
waltzing off the bookshop shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Can Satan worship be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, vigilant adults are challenging teachers who
read the Harry Potter series aloud in their classrooms. The Family
Friendly Library Association, including its Massachusetts
affiliate, wants to know why religious themes are verboten in
public schools but witchcraft is all the rage.
</P>
<P>
   It was only a matter of time.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since J. K. Rowling took the publishing world and
children's imaginations by storm a year ago with the first of her
novels about a magical, parallel universe beneath the British isle,
the clock was ticking. How long before grown-ups found something
sinister in the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry? What
does it mean that so many kids love these books? Has Rowling
bewitched them? Entranced everyone under the age of 13?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe children see their own life struggles in Harry's. Maybe
they see the schoolyard bully in his horrid ``Muggle'' cousin,
Dudley. Maybe they don't see anything at all recognizable in the
universe Rowling has created. Why does it matter to anyone but the
mass marketers who most assuredly are analyzing every page of every
book in search of the ``magic'' formula in order to replicate
Rowling's success.
</P>
<P>
   The simple truth is that we aren't meant to know everything
about our children's world. It's theirs, not ours. When our
freshly-minted teenager grunts ``fine'' in response to our inquiry
about the quality of his day, he is not hiding something from us;
he is preserving something for himself. When our suddenly-secretive
daughter tucks her diary between the mattress and box spring, she
is not hoarding information; she is honing her identity.
</P>
<P>
   When did respecting our children's privacy and independence
become an indicator of parental neglect?
</P>
<P>
   We are packing the Halloween decorations away this week,
replacing the cackling witch on the mantel with the Thanksgiving
pilgrims. But as we box up the rubber skeletons and the monster
masks, it is hard not to note how different, how sanitized, the
ultimate kids' holiday was this year. Post-Columbine, the grim
reaper was stripped of his rubber sickle at the schoolhouse door;
the pirate was disarmed of his plastic dagger. Not because of
reasonable concerns that ``you could poke an eye out with that
thing,'' but because of unreasonable fears that kids would mistake
one another's Halloween props for lethal weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   In one school in Massachusetts, a child makes a list of
classmates he doesn't especially like and is sent home until a
therapist can assuage the fears of parents (or the liability
concerns of the school's lawyers.)
</P>
<P>
   In a school in Texas, a child earns an ``A'' on a class
assignment and more than a night in juvenile detention after his
jittery teacher decides that maybe his scary essay was a veiled
threat.
</P>
<P>
   It does not minimize the seriousness of school violence to ask
whether we have gone too far in our attempts to shield our children
from the normal anxieties of life at century's end. Fantasy is
fine, we say, as long as the content is regulated by us, not them.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Harry Potter's adventures involve struggles between good
and evil. It is not giving away the plot to note that, in the three
novels published so far, good triumphs. Sounds a lot like the Bible
to me.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is something simple and pure slipped into our
children's lives. It sneaked in under the adult radar screen. Its
magic spread by word of mouth from cabin to cabin at summer camp,
from swing to slide in the schoolyard, from top to bottom bunk in
the boys' room down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we're jealous. Our children have a rich interior life. We
can't own it. It doesn't belong to us, anymore than our children
do.

SHEPARD IN THE FIELDS OF KARMIC CONNECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although it can become a dangerous
oversimplification of the concept, the popular idea that you
actually sow and reap karma holds a great deal of appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Deliberately sow good stuff, and it will come back to you as
good stuff _ or at least as a milder dose of bad stuff you were
already in karmic line to receive. Sow bad karma and, sooner or
later, it will come back to bite you on the butt.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sooner-or-later part that makes karma a much more
mystical and long-view form of justice than versions like ``An eye
for an eye'' or ``The wages of sin is death.''
</P>
<P>
   Because karma is the weighty total of your actions in this or
any lifetime _ and the driving force of your fate _ you might have
to wait a couple of incarnations, much less 10 or 15 years, to get
back specific good or ill you once sowed. Considering that most of
us tend to forget what we sowed about 15 MINUTES after we did it,
we see no connection to our eventual harvest. Our overview of our
personal karmic farm is, ``(Bleep) happens.''
</P>
<P>
   This myopia blinds us to the fact that our karmic farm is not an
island. Our fields bleed into the fields of every other person we
encounter in life. And theirs bleed into ours. Sow bad karma, you
make the world a worse place; sow good, you improve it.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings me to Judy Shepard.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of Matthew Shepard _ the gay Wyoming college student
who was beaten to death by two sick, young homophobes _ Judy
Shepard sowed some truly wonderful (and powerfully countercultural)
karma last week.
</P>
<P>
   After a Laramie jury found Aaron McKinney guilty of the felony
murder of her son _ a crime that qualifies for the death penalty _
Shepard helped negotiate a deal between the prosecution and
defense. It spared McKinney's life.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Cal Rerucha initially did not want to take the deal
of life without parole or appeal, he said. But Judy Shepard
convinced him _ and her pro-death penalty husband _ that it was the
right thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a remarkable woman to be able to go through what she has
and to do what she has done,'' Rerucha said. ``And what she has
done is said Matthew stood for something and that something was
tolerance, a tolerance of people.''
</P>
<P>
   In a radical departure from the angry and vengeful norm, Judy
Shepard told Rerucha, ``It would be wrong if our motives were
revenge instead of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost never do we hear the loved ones of murder victims
distinguish between justice and revenge. In case after case, the
``family's wishes'' are cited as the primary reason that only a
death sentence can equal justice. Execution has become the lone
catalyst for ``healing'' and ``closure.'' Even the youngest members
of a grieving clan ``can't wait'' for the day they get to watch the
condemned killer die.
</P>
<P>
   The aberrations from this norm are few and under-publicized.
</P>
<P>
   Who hears the sad, merciful voice of a Bud Welch, who lost his
daughter in the Oklahoma City bombing, over an enraged,
death-hungry chorus of people like Richard Thornton, whose wife was
murdered by Karla Faye Tucker?
</P>
<P>
   As he watched Tucker die by lethal injection, Thornton said
aloud to his dead wife: ``Here she comes, baby doll. She's all
yours. The world's a better place.''
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong.
</P>

   Like scores of other hurt and angry family members, Thornton was
the unwitting recipient of someone else's horrendous karma dump.
But he compounded the negativity, for himself and the rest of us,

   After hearing her son's murderer blame the slaying on drugs,
alcohol and ``gay panic,'' after enduring weeks in a courtroom with
nightmarish testimony about (and photos of) Matthew's last hours,
she said ``yes'' to a defense plea to save McKinney's life.

<P>
   Her choice will not bring back her child, anymore than
Thornton's will bring back his wife. But, karmically speaking, Judy
Shepard has lightened her own load somewhere down the line.

   And all of us with fields adjoining hers should thank her for
making this a better world.

WHAT ARE FOSSILS MADE OF? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. What minerals are fossils made of?
</P>
<P>
   A.A., Bellingham &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Fossils can be made of anything,'' according to Doug Erwin,
curator of paleontology at the Smithsonian's National Museum of
Natural History. They come in four basic types.
</P>
<P>
   The first is simply the original material of the creature that
died.
</P>
<P>
   The second is called a permineralized fossil. That forms when
minerals carried by fluids fill the pores and tiny spaces in the
original biological material. When the fluid evaporates, the
minerals harden, filling those spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the fluids and minerals dissolve away all the original
material and only the hardened mineral remains. An example is
petrified wood. ``The process can be so fine that you can actually
make out individual cells in the hardened minerals,'' Erwin says.
</P>
<P>
   A third kind of fossil is made like a cast in a mold. Animals or
plants that fell on a soft, muddy spot, often in a shallow lake or
ocean bottom, left an impression of their shape, like a footprint
on a muddy trail. Over time silt and other minerals deposited into
the impression and hardened into rock in the shape of the
impression. Erwin says the oldest fossils ever found, 3.56
billion-year-old single-celled organisms, were impressions in
chert, a rock, in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are the fossils of ancient insects preserved in
amber, a plant resin that oozed out, enveloped the unlucky bug, and
hardened around it, preserving the entire creature. Erwin says the
Jurassic Park notion that such fossils might yield ancient DNA is
still science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Holy Grail of fossil science,'' he says. ``But DNA is
too fragile. It breaks down.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is the densest element?
</P>
<P>
   LAUREN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. At the level of a single atom, there's no topping uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the weight and density of an atom comes from the protons
and neutrons in its nucleus. Uranium (Ur), element 92, has 92
protons in the nucleus, along with 146 neutrons. That gives it a
total atomic weight of slightly more than 238. It's the heaviest
naturally occurring element.
</P>
<P>
   Since all atoms are about the same size, the more protons and
neutrons an atom is packed with, the denser it is. Think of it like
grains of sand inside a ping pong ball. The more grains a ball is
packed with, the denser it is.
</P>
<P>
   Lead (Pb) is atomic number 82, atomic weight 207. If Superman
couldn't see through Pb, he sure couldn't see through Ur.
</P>
<P>
   But when a bunch of atoms join and form a molecule, Osmium (Os)
wins the density title. Atom for atom it's only a middleweight,
number 76, atomic weight 190. But when Osmium atoms form a
molecule, they can squeeze together in a way that takes up less
space than when uranium or lead atoms bond together. It's like
being able to pack more grains of sand inside the ping pong ball.
More atoms in the same space means a heavier, denser molecule.
</P>
<P>
   Osmium has a density of 22.583 grams per cubic centimeter.
Uranium is 19.07. Lead is 11.34. Rock averages around 3. Water is
1. Butter is .86. Cork is .22.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLE DE JEAN CHARLES, Louisiana _ The retired priest tells his
story with a faded photo of his smiling mother in her flower
garden. Those were the good old days of the 1950s, the Rev. Roch
Naquin explains, when cows grazed in a big field behind the family
home and a new road brought the first cars to this remote bayou
village.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the Gulf of Mexico began swallowing up the land,
turning the family's pasture into a marsh and salting what was left
of his mother's garden. The prized road, once flanked by broad
green fields, became a causeway through open ocean, waves washing
over the bleak asphalt when the wind blows.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do nothing, in 10 years, this place will be water,''
said Naquin, who, like many of the Chitimacha Indians living on the
low ridge, has put his modest house up on cinderblocks to escape
the advancing water.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal Louisiana is literally sinking into the sea, drowning
places such as Isle de Jean Charles and giving the rest of North
America an alarming glimpse of what may lie in store in the 21st
century if sea levels rise as much as some scientists expect.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1930, an area 50 percent bigger than Rhode Island has
returned to the sea in Louisiana, and Louisiana State University
researchers say another Rhode Island-sized patch could go in the
next 50 years. Louisiana accounts for 80 percent of the coastal
wetlands destroyed in the United States annually, a dramatic threat
to one of the most productive fisheries in the world.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Louisiana's problems are unique, at least for now.
The region south of New Orleans is so low-lying that locals refer
to land just 3 feet above sea level as ``a ridge.'' And the land is
so new, formed by sediment deposits from the Mississippi River over
the past 5,000 years, that it is still sinking.
</P>
<P>
   State officials inadvertently triggered the rapid land loss in
the 1930s when they built up the levee system to prevent a repeat
of a 1927 flood that killed hundreds. Unfortunately, the levees
also blocked the Mississippi from delivering fresh mud that could
have built up the delta region.
</P>
<P>
   Despite obvious differences in geography, New England could face
similar problems if global warming and other forces cause sea level
to rise 7 to 39 inches by 2100 as a United Nations scientific panel
predicts. Nearly 10 percent of the land in low-lying towns such as
Hull and Nantucket would be submerged, while storm surges would
flood many places that now stay bone dry.
</P>
<P>
   If sea level rises significantly and the public doesn't prepare,
warns Joe Pelczarski, senior planner with the Massachusetts office
of Coastal Zone Management, ``Every storm would be a misery and
we'd be well into disaster scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Louisiana doesn't have to wait for the 21st century
for a ``disaster scenario'': it's here.
</P>
<P>
   Already, federal, state, and local officials are taking
extraordinary measures to stem the rising tide, from raising roads
to rebuilding islands to diverting the river to areas that need
sediment. Coast 2050, a state and federal plan, calls for $14
billion in coastal restoration projects over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is, Louisiana has less than 10 percent of the
funding necessary to carry out Coast 2050, which would be the
largest ecological restoration project in US history, almost twice
as large as the current record holder, the restoration of the
Florida Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana is dedicated to restoring the coast as best we can,
but we are a poor state,'' said state Natural Resources Secretary
Jack Caldwell, who recently shepherded $15 million for coastal
restoration through the Legislature to prove to Congress that the
state is serious.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell is pinning his hopes on the Conservation and
Reinvestment Act, a bill in Congress that would divert offshore oil
and gas tax revenues to coastal states, with special provisions for
Louisiana. Because the sinking delta is so important to US fishing
as well as energy interests, Caldwell says its problems should be
solved at a national level, too.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, solving Louisiana's erosion problem may be only a
down payment toward coping with higher sea levels. The US
Environmental Protection Agency estimates that improving coastal
defenses nationally to face higher water will probably cost more
than $100 billion next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the prototype for accelerated sea level rise. If you're
looking for strategies of how people cope,'' Louisiana will be the
model, said Paul Kemp, a coastal geologist at Louisiana State
University.
</P>
<P>
   The people of south Louisiana have always had to live with the
deceptive power of the Mississippi River, which quietly carries
sediment from 31 states as it wends its way toward the Gulf of
Mexico. Over the last 5,000 years, the river created 7,000 square
miles of land in the delta where residents developed precise words
such as ``sloo'' and ``chenier'' to describe the meeting place of
land and water.
</P>
<P>
   But the French, Native American, and other ethnic groups who
settled the region knew that, just as the river could build, it
could also destroy. The great flood of 1927 gave New Orleans such a
fright that officials strategically dynamited the levee so that the
swollen river destroyed other communities and buried them under 18
inches of sediment.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it turned out that the very measures they took to
tame the Mississippi were stealing the land from beneath their
feet. The levee system effectively channeled the river so that it
delivered its sediments, not to the delta, but into the deep water
of the Gulf of Mexico where, ironically, the freshwater has proven
toxic, causing algae blooms that suck up most of the oxygen in a
``dead zone'' where few fish can live.
</P>
<P>
   The oil and gas industry exacerbated erosion by cutting scores
of canals through the delta for pipelines and workers, allowing
saltwater into the interior of the marshes. Meanwhile, sea level
itself rose by about a foot in the past century, allowing storms to
reach further inland than before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Pogo said, `We have met the enemy and he is us,' ''
said Mark Davis, executive director of the Baton Rouge-based
Coastal Restoration Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even though analysts agree on the causes of Louisiana's
problem, finding a solution proved difficult. The sinking delta is
both so enormous that state and federal officials ended up funding
lots of small, often ineffectual, experiments through the 1980s and
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ironically, the cornerstone to Louisiana's strategy to save
the land is to bring in more water, cutting gates in the levees
that hold the Mississippi so that its rich sediment can reach
eroding areas. The main river diversion so far, the $26 million
Caernarvon Project in Plaquemines Parish, has rebuilt at least 450
acres of soft, mucky land since 1991, and created a world class
bass fishing area to boot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without this diversion, this marsh would die,'' said Donald
Ansardi, pointing from his airboat across a meadow studded with
black willow trees that have sprouted in the last five years.
Ansardi, land manager for Delacroix Corp. which owns the marsh,
said fresh water from Caernarvon has prevented saltwater from
killing the grass and trees.
</P>
<P>
   But river diversions have stirred opposition from those who
worry they may do more harm than good and even ruin water quality.
Oystermen have sued the state over the Caernarvon project, arguing
that the infusion of freshwater has damaged saltwater oyster beds.
Likewise, Louisiana Governor Mike Foster vetoed an $87 million
diversion after concerns were raised that it could spoil Lake
Ponchartrain.
</P>
<P>
   The only other option is to build more fortifications. Already
going forward on a massive scale are a $350 million plan to elevate
the road to Port Fourchon and a $36 million proposal to build up
barrier islands that are the first line of defense against tropical
storms and hurricanes as they come ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Out on East Timbalier Island, Secretary Caldwell beams at the
hundreds of pelicans roosting near the black mangrove trees planted
by an oil company a few years back. The island was on a track to
sink completely by 2005, but it has received more than a million
cubic yards of sand plus a new seawall courtesy of a National
Marine Fisheries Service restoration fund.
</P>
<P>
   To Caldwell, the island shows that state and federal officials
can counterattack erosion _ if they have the resources. By his
calculation, the state needs more than $400 million a year in
federal funding rather than the $40 million a year they now get.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give us the money, we can do it. This is not
experimental. We've been experimenting for 10 years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, in some ways, all of coastal Louisiana is an experiment,
one that other coastal regions are watching with varying degrees of
alarm as both the damage and repair costs mount. Other states know
that global warming, driven by the burning of fossil fuels such as
oil, could eventually raise sea level so much that they will be in
the same expensive boat as Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   And the Louisianans have a message for the world as nations
brace for the erosion problems of the 21st century: it's better to
prevent the sea level rise in the first place rather than try to
fight its effects as they are doing now. As Davis of the Coastal
Restoration Council said, ``We're starting to gain some respect for
God as an engineer.''

IN NORTH WOODS, JOBS VANISH, ANGER GROWS

<P>
   ALLAGASH, Maine _ Even in its best days, this city was an
outpost, the last cluster of lights on a road that plunges into
forest. Allagash is not on the way anywhere, and it thrived for a
hundred years in unusual cultural isolation; surrounded on all
sides by French-Canadians, its citizens still speak with a
Scotch-Irish burr.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Mainers about Allagash now, and they will know exactly
what you are talking about. Twice in the last year, a small group
of angry, unemployed woodsmen from this town blockaded the Canadian
border, accusing their government of allowing Canadian loggers to
steal their jobs and, ultimately, drive Americans out of the North
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Their cry resonates powerfully in a thickly wooded region
surrounded on three sides by Canada, rekindling an old fear that
politicians downstate tend to forget that there are people up here
among the trees. Aroostook County juts into Canada like a
peninsula, bordering New Brunswick to the east and Quebec to the
west. As the farming economy declined between 1969 and 1994, the
county lost 14 percent of its population, even as neighboring Maine
counties gained comparable amounts, according to Robert Roper, who
teaches economics at the University of Maine in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Allagash's last stand is reminding people that towns can wash
away, that their children may seek work, or even build new lives,
far from the places their ancestors settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this,'' said Hilton Hafford, 41, a leader of the
group of Allagash protesters. ``There's a certain amount of people
who were meant to live in Idaho, and there's a certain amount of
people who were meant to live in Allagash. That's why we were put
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadians have been allowed to work in Maine as long as they
were not taking American jobs. But Hafford and his fellow
protesters say that as the exchange rate has made Canadian labor
even cheaper, the system has broken down. Reacting to the protests,
state labor officials have ordered a study, the first since 1977,
to see what effect the Canadian workers are having on the wages of
Americans. The results are expected by mid-month.
</P>
<P>
   Hafford's critics, who include some in his town, assert that he
and his friends _ a small group that has ranged in number from five
to 12 _ have chosen protest over work. Department of Labor
officials argue that they have spent ``thousands of hours'' trying
to place the Allagash loggers in jobs, only to have them reject the
positions as low-paying or inferior.
</P>
<P>
   At root, many fault the Allagash men for resisting the economic
forces that sometimes require workers not only to update their
skills, but to leave their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar dilemma in the string of towns that line the
US-Canadian border. In nearby Fort Kent, traffic picks up at 2
a.m., as young men commute hundreds of miles for work downstate,
said Kim Doustou, executive director of the Fort Kent Chamber of
Commerce. And that is the young men who stay. ``Most of the kids
here fly right out of the area,'' according to John Paradis, 40,
who owns Doris's Restaurant in Fort Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a booth, Norman Bouchard, 65, agreed. He said the last
of his nine children, a lumber hauler, was about to sell his
equipment and move to another part of the state. ``The more you
talk to people around here, the more you'll realize something's
really wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A companion requested anonymity because he was afraid of losing
his job for a large lumber company. ``They call us crybabies,'' he
said, ``but there's no more living in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Allagash has endured a painful decline. In 1986, on the occasion
of its centennial, Allagash roasted a whole moose on a spit in
celebration; 10 years later, both its high school and elementary
school had shut down for a lack of students. Now scores of black
flies mill on the inside of a gymnasium window and across the
street; the old fire station is for sale. The population of
Allagash, which reached a high of 750 around the turn of the
century, fell to 242 in the last count, according to town selectman
Roy Gardner. Of those who are left, the average age is 65, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost no young men in town. On a recent evening,
Shannon McBreairty, 19, and Donna Bernier, 35, ate dinner together
at Two Rivers Lunch as both of their boyfriends had left town to
find work logging. Bernier's son, who is 19, also has left. Troy
Jackson, 31, who has joined Hafford in the protest effort, tried to
commute for a while, waking up every morning in the dark for the
long drive south to his job, but after a while his 3-year-old
learned how to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oldest one used to hold my finger at night so I didn't
leave,'' he recalled. ``I drove five hours and you'd think about it
the whole way.''
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point, Hafford began to see the shrinking of
Allagash as a personal assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were to hire hit men from New York and start at one
end of town and work their way saying, everybody leave this town,
that wouldn't go too good across the United States. But you see,
they're doing it little by little. It's subtle,'' said Hafford.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his friends give up the fight, trundling south to
find contract work in Connecticut, he added, there will be no one
left to argue for Allagash.
</P>
<P>
   ``What chance do we have of failure?'' he asked. ``The reason
we're here in the first place is we decided we wanted to live here
more than anyone else did.''
</P>
<P>
   But down Allagash's single road, selectman Gardner _ a direct
descendant of the man who founded the town _ sees a community that
has been overtaken by history as woodsmen with chain saws and cable
skidders were gradually replaced by well-educated operators of
complex machinery. His own children never had any desire to work in
the woods, and neither does his grandson, and it has less to do
with Canadian competition than the desire to find an easier, more
stable living. For his part, Gardner sees Allagash's future in
tourism and retirement homes _ both businesses he has entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be three or four logging camps in the area with
100 men in each of them. Today, every one of those camps are being
replaced by machines,'' said Gardner. ``That's nobody's fault.
Times are changing. You have to change with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the people of Allagash may have to accept that
resource-dependent industries make and break small towns. John
Cashwell, president of the Seven Islands Land Company, which
manages 1 million acres of woods in northern Maine, said he made
that point to a group of legislators and labor officials who
visited the North Woods to discuss the logging issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night I asked everyone standing there, `Who works in the
town that he grew up in?' and not a one, including me, raised his
hand,'' said Cashwell. ``If it's a one-horse town, and the horses
leave, what are you going to do? This is a group of people who feel
they have a right to stay in their hometown, and that's all right.
But it's not everybody else's fault if things don't turn out the
way they wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to Hafford, who built himself a log house that
he cannot afford to live in.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Calvin, recognized his son early as a woodsman _
``He was quite . . . an outdoor fella. Anything he tried, he could
do,'' he said _ and Hafford does not take kindly to the idea that
his special talent is obsolete. Asked how far he is willing to take
this battle, he mentioned the war memorial in front of what used to
be Allagash's school. He said: ``You know the scary thing about it,
is I'm not sure.''

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As he winds up the taping of yet another episode of ``The Tom
Green Show,'' chock full of practical jokes and atrocities _ one of
his first produced in Los Angeles _ Tom Green is ready to hit the
showers. He drags his beloved supporting stooges _ Glenn Humplik,
who, having a name like Humplik, is accustomed to abuse, and is
therefore the victim of many of Green's pranks; and Phil Giroux,
the guy who spends the show sipping java and chortling _ into a
tiny showering booth.
</P>
<P>
   All three are as naked as MTV's standards and practices will
allow _ which, you might be surprised to hear, is not entirely
naked _ and, once packed into the shower, reed-thin Tom starts
getting a little too familiar with his more substantially built
buddies. Glenn reacts accordingly _ which is to say, with dismay _
and the combination of cramped environs and slippery floor sends
the three sprawling across the stage as the entire shower
contraption collapses in a heap of scrap aluminum. It's the perfect
bookend to the beginning of the taping, when a rowdy group of fans
swarmed Green and very nearly snapped him in half.
</P>
<P>
   These are halcyon days for Tom Green, though he admits things
are moving a bit fast. He's been in town for little more than a
month, and the reception area of his new L.A. office looks like a
disaster area, with a 4-foot-tall mountain of boxes _ his? the last
tenant's? _ tossed, not stacked, in one corner. Green has to shoot
a battery of shows before those boxes can even be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not the ideal schedule,'' he sighs while
relaxing in his office. Unlike a lot of comics, Green isn't ``on''
during interviews _ in fact, he's so laid back and somniferous you
could almost say he's ``off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the victim of the show popping like it did. It's
shoot-shoot-shoot, throw on three shows, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot,
throw on four shows. In Canada, we'd shoot (remote-location
segments) for six months, then go in the studio and do 13 shows.
But we're moving toward that. At least I hope we are.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day before taping that shower scene _ which is as scary
as Hitchcock's but for different reasons _ the between-segment
material for that show hadn't even been written. And 10 minutes
before the scheduled taping time, the construction crew was still
piecing together the set.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happens when you're an overnight sensation.
Green, for the uninitiated, is a Canadian who, after years of cult
success up north, appeared on MTV back in January and became an
immediate sensation. Certainly, he was attention-getting,
performing such bits of conceptual comedy as filling his parents'
home with farm animals, trashing a grocery store with a motorized
wheelchair and enjoying fresh milk direct from its source.
Americans got a taste of Green in a series of
on-the-road-to-the-Super-Bowl commercials he did for Pepsi last
January.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor is normally placid, but his eyes tend to betray an
element of dementia. ``He is our audience,'' declares John Miller,
MTV's senior vice president of programming and development. Miller
got a tape from Green and put the show into production without
pausing to produce a pilot episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not afraid to make an ass of himself, yet you still like
him. He apologizes after he does things. But oh, my God, he likes
to push people's buttons. He's your friend who's always pushing
you, who's seducing you and all the while you're getting into a
load of trouble. He's just egging you on.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's schtick is the sort of thing David Letterman used to do,
mixed with Andy Kaufman's brand of comic confrontation. It's
``Candid Camera'' as run by the Marquis de Sade's bratty nephew,
only the camera is never hidden. It's right in his victims' faces,
which usually amps up their irritation quotient.
</P>
<P>
   The show includes the spectacle of ostensibly ordinary people
undergoing psychological torment _ an element that's wildly popular
these days. Look at the hit film ``The Blair Witch Project'' or
prime-time game shows such as ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
Even the Food Network, of all places, has concocted its own,
exceedingly benign, version in which Gordon Elliot enters random
homes with a chef and makes a gourmet dinner from whatever's in his
subject's fridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, if you wanted to do a TV show, you had to have a
studio, and you had to have cameras, and it was more controlled,''
Green observes. ``TV got used to making things that were
controlled. And it's taken people a while to get used to the idea
that we can make things smaller, and when you do that, you
instantly get realer. You get real life and the public, once they
saw that for the first few times, felt a little fed up with seeing
the same thing over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   The outraged reactions Green elicits from his subjects are no
accident, he explains. ``The reason people get a little freaked out
is that we've set up our shoots in a way that we don't look like
we're from MTV or a TV station,'' he says. ``We have one cameraman,
a small-format camera _ the goal is to make people think I'm some
college student out doing some avant-garde, guerrilla piece. They
don't think it's serious in any way. So they have no problem with
punching the camera or telling me to get the hell away. Then, when
they find out it's a real show, they usually change gears.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he concedes that it's a challenge to get people he has
royally miffed to sign agreements allowing the footage to be shown
on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we lose people _ it's one of the most difficult
elements of the show, to be honest,'' he admits. ``We still haven't
been able to figure out how to do it. We have a few people who are,
you could say, highly trained at telling people, `It's just a joke
_ you've been on ``Candid Camera,''' that kind of thing. People
eventually see the humor, even if they've been really mad on
camera, to the point of being violent. I had a woman punch me in
the head three times, and as soon as the camera stopped rolling,
and the release person started talking to her, she realized she had
seen me on `Oprah.' People come around really quickly once they
realize we're from MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   Such problems didn't exist when Green did his show in Canada,
first on a cable-access channel and later on the Canadian
equivalent of Comedy Central. The show was essentially a reaction
to the youthful abuse he got from myriad security guards for doing
silly things on the premises of businesses they protected a bit too
seriously. In college, Green worked the late-night shift at the
university radio station, where he met Humplik, who is five years
his senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of weird stuff,'' Green recalls. ``We were in
Ottawa, which is like doing a show in Washington, a conservative,
government town. We'd tell everyone listening to meet us on the
front lawn of the Parliament Building at 2 a.m. to play soccer, and
about 100 kids'd show up. ... The police'd be there, wondering what
the hell we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Humplik represents the quintessential good sport. ``The most
embarrassing thing was when he put a hidden camera in my dressing
room while I was trying to get into supertight Spandex,'' Humplik
says, prying off the wooden clogs and Scottish kilt Green forced
him to wear for a taping. ``But it's all in good fun. It has to
hurt me for them to find it funny. Hanging out with him keeps me
mentally ageless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has opened doors for me in real life,'' says Humplik, who
works for a computer company in Ottawa, on why he puts up with the
incessant abuse. ``My co-workers are weirded-out a lot (by the
attention).'' At this taping, Green dragged a teen-ager out of the
audience to send home with Humplik. ``I'll give (him) a blanket and
let him sleep in the car or put him up at Tom's parents' house,''
Humplik confides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn stands up for himself _ he just reacts so perfectly to
Tom,'' says MTV's Miller. ``It's a challenge to come up with stuff
that will upset him.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's most popular vignettes involve Green annoying _ or
humiliating _ his long-suffering parents, Dick and Mary Jane. Green
has painted their home plaid, air-brushed a lesbian love scene on
the hood of his pop's car and dropped a cow's head in their bed
while they were sleeping. Though the bits are generally billed as
All In Good Fun, he admits there's a certain catharsis, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, when I was in high school and younger, they were
more controlling,'' he says. ``They've mellowed quite a bit since I
went to college and found a direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But before that, they were extremely concerned that I was
going to end up drifting off into (oblivion) _ but I think they
took it a little more seriously than a lot of parents do.
</P>
<P>
   ``A funny thing about their situation, though, is that they were
always angry with me while growing up for doing precisely the
things I'm now doing for a living. And they were angry that I was
doing those things because they felt that if I kept doing them, I'd
fail school and I'd never be able to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Catch-22 that my parents are in right now,'' he says
with a wicked smile. ``When we barge in in the middle of the night
and toss a cow's head on their bed, they're really mad that this
cow's head is bleeding on their mattress, but on the other hand,
they're really glad I'm working.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his antics _ attempting to pleasure a dead moose he
found on the side of a road, barging into viewers' homes at 3 in
the morning and irritating their parents, bellowing into a bullhorn
at passers-by that they suck _ Green has never gotten in serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have called the police, but there's never been any
grounds to arrest me,'' he insists. ``I'm not this irrational,
crazed lunatic who goes out and does these things without thought.
There are a lot of writers here, and we spend a lot of time before
we go out planning these things. We don't want anyone to get hurt
or emotionally distraught over anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses a beat, then drops the punchline like a hammer:
``Except maybe my parents, but they deserve it.'' &QL;

GALILEO: AT THE OTHER END OF THE TELESCOPE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOUGLAS BAILEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 350 years after his death, Galileo Galilei, the father
of modern science, is enjoying a renaissance of revisionism.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an illegitimate daughter few people knew he had, a
diminutive woman writer from New York who finds extraordinary
stories in ordinary places, and a contemporary Pope with an unusual
interest in astronomy, the Italian astronomer is being
rediscovered. The high-school headlines that Galileo was the
inventor of the telescope, an enemy of the church, and a possessed
heretic are being proved either wrong or richly more complex than
the popular myths that have endured.
</P>
<P>
   There's little doubt that Galileo's insistence that the Sun, not
the Earth, was at the center of our planetary system put him at
extreme odds with the Catholic Church and led to his being
condemned and placed under house arrest for the last years of his
life. But the picture emerging today is breathing new life into the
man, providing context and texture to the one-dimensional anecdote
that Galileo was a scientific crusader and enemy of Church. He was
partly that. But now, from across three centuries, he is speaking
to us about our 20th century battles over science vs. religion and
creationism vs. evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``To him there was one truth. Half of it was in the Bible, and
the rest was for us to discover,'' says Dava Sobel, author of the
just-released ``Galileo's Daughter,'' a portrait of the scientist
through the surviving letters of a daughter historians had all but
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel, a former New York Times science writer, was drawn to
Galileo while researching her first book, ``Longitude,'' about an
obscure but historically significant 18th-century quest to solve
oceanic navigation problems. That book has become a surprise
international best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ripping story
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What she found stunned her. Stumbling across a letter from
Galileo's daughter, one of three children the scientist had with a
mistress, Sobel immediately sensed there was ``a ripping story''
there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea Galileo had a daughter,'' she said during a
recent interview at the Hayden Planetarium in Boston. ``And then to
find that she was a nun...I was overtaken by the thought of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobel embarked on a year-long task of personally translating the
124 surviving letters that his daughter, who was baptized Virginia
but took the name Maria Celeste in honor of her father's interests,
penned in Italian between 1623 and 1633. The last was sent just
four months before her death in a convent where she spent most of
her life.
</P>
<P>
   A master storyteller, Sobel humanizes Galileo in ways no
scholarly treatise can. Presenting a vivid picture of 17th-century
Italy roiling from the bubonic plague and the 30 Years' War, Sobel
shows us a scientist keen on discovery and broadening his knowledge
of the heavens, but at the same time a man tending his garden,
enjoying his wine, and buying gifts for his beloved daughter, to
whom he would send his shirts for mending or to have the collars
bleached.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved life,'' she says. ``And he was a character. A great
writer, philosopher and father, along with being a great scientist.
I never intended the book to speak about the current issues (of
creationism and evolution), but I think it does. The fact that
Galileo, in the middle of this great time, laid the foundation of
all modern science from his perspective as a devout Catholic is
fascinating to me. He didn't have to reject his religion to do what
he did. He becomes so much more complex and interesting when seen
in this entirety.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Galileo's motives
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most compelling fact that surfaces is that Galileo
forged a strong, meaningful relationship with the Church and that
he pressed his heliocentric theories not to destroy the Catholic
teachings, but to protect them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He essentially said `Look, someone's going to come along
someday with a more powerful telescope than mine and prove it to
you,'' says Sobel. ``He didn't want his Church to look foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   In his second heresy trial, which ultimately led to his
condemnation, Galileo accurately predicted what lay in store.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take note, theologians,'' Galileo reportedly told his
inquisitors, ``that in your desire to make matters of faith out of
propositions relating to the fixity of sun and earth you run the
risk of eventually having to condemn as heretics those who would
declare the earth to stand still and the sun to change position _
eventually, I say, at such a time as it might be physically or
logically proved that the earth moves and the sun stands still.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Church's seeming immovable position that the Earth
was the center of all things, the revistation of the episode by
Sobel and others is actually elevating the Catholic Church's image,
dispelling the myth that it was entirely closed-minded about
science and astronomy. Galileo was in fact widely revered and
well-liked inside the church, and his notions were tolerated, even
encouraged, to a point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every one of his books had to be approved by the church
censors,'' Sobel notes. ``Even `Dialogues,' the one for which he
was ultimately condemned, had been okayed.''
</P>
<P>
   Another book published last month, ``The Sun in the Church,'' by
science historian John L. Heilbron, confirms that the Church in
Galileo's day zealously studied astronomy, mostly to get an
accurate fix on Easter Sunday, and adapted many of its cathedrals,
including the Vatican's, into solar observatories.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the line
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So why was Galileo condemned? The idea that the sun was the
center of the universe wasn't his alone, having first been
theorized years earlier by Copernicus. It's even likely that
astronomers within the Catholic church correctly calculated the
earth's position among the planets. But an edict against teaching
such a revolutionary notion prevented discourse of the subject
beyond hypothesis.
</P>
<P>
   That was the line Galileo crossed. He not only taught it, he
wrote about it in Italian, instead of Latin, the traditional
language of scholars, so that his Copernican notions would spread
among the masses.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still, from the Church's perspective, the great astronomer
took it upon himself to interpret the scriptures, something only
theologians could do.
</P>
<P>
   In Galileo's mind, as depicted by Sobel and buttressed by Maria
Celeste's letters _ his missives to her do not survive _ there was
no conflict or contradiction between articles of faith and articles
of science. Both come from God's hand. Galileo wrote in a
compelling, yet ultimately damaging, letter to the Grand Duchess
Christina of Lorraine in December of 1613:

EX-HEAD OF N.Y.'S METROPOLITAN MUSEUM DEMYSTIFIES ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALICE THORSON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now here's a fact about the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in
Kansas City, Mo., that many avid museumgoers may not know: Esteemed
curator Laurence Sickman, who died in 1988, purchased much of the
museum's famed Oriental collection with cigarettes _ 8-cent PX
cigarettes, as a matter of fact, which were the unofficial currency
in postwar Japan.
</P>
<P>
   So notes Thomas Hoving, former director of New York's
Metropolitan Museum of Art, in his new book, Art for Dummies, a
recent addition to the ``For Dummies'' series of reference books
put out by IDG Books Worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other volumes in the series, including Horses for
Dummies Antiques for Dummies and Opera for Dummies, Hoving's book
takes a breezy Cliff's Notes approach to his topic in an attempt to
render an intimidating wealth of information comprehensible to a
novice.
</P>
<P>
   Within an airy 382 pages, he covers the whole of art history,
from prehistoric times to the present. There are chapters on how to
collect, the greatest works of Western civilization, the 10 most
interesting artists of the past and the 10 most interesting artists
of the present.
</P>
<P>
   The list of the 10 most interesting artists of the past, which
encompasses Goya, Leonardo, Rembrandt, Michelangelo and Picasso,
contains no surprises. The list of the 10 most interesting artists
of the present, which includes Andrew Wyeth, Wayne Thiebaud and
Dale Chihuly, is surprising for its conservatism and lack of
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   The back of the book offers an insider's guide to the world's
top museums and their masterworks, which is where Hoving discloses
how Sickman went about amassing the Nelson's Oriental collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me,'' Hoving said during a stop at The Kansas City
Star. ``It was (at) one of these museum directors' meetings where
all you did was drink constantly. He said, `I gotta tell you how to
really collect.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in the occupation army, and he had a deal with Kansas
City because he was going to come back to be the head curator or
run it or whatever, and he got these 8 cent PX cigs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American government scrip that MacArthur turned out was
virtually worthless. There was no yen, and they used cigarettes as
the currency in Japan in '45, '6, '7.
</P>
<P>
   `You didn't smoke them,' he said. `Oh, God, no; this was money.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He knew that these people had plundered the Chinese for their
great paintings, and he didn't have any feeling about taking it
away from them, and they wanted to eat. Most of those scrolls come
from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Art insiders and experts will enjoy Art for Dummies for the same
reason they devoured Making the Mummies Dance, Hoving's tell-all
1993 chronicle of his 10 years at the Met. Facts, not to mention
opinions, are entertaining, served up on the platter of Hoving's
irreverent and irrepressible personality.
</P>
<P>
   Hoving the debunker has been known to make his professional
colleagues squirm, but his frankness in Art for Dummies creates a
bridge of trust with the general reader.
</P>
<P>
   His insistence, for instance, on the book's very first page that
the art world is not as snobby as people think is more believable
for his admission that museums still have a long way to go in
communicating with the public.
</P>
<P>
   This is a favorite hobby horse of Hoving's, and one on which he
spoke with some heat during his interview at The Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bloody museum in this country has in its charter, `For
the public education,' '' he said. ``And they've all failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoving lays much of the blame for the current controversy over
the Brooklyn Museum's ``Sensation'' exhibit of new British art
squarely on the shoulders of the museum. Contemporary art generally
is a stumbling block for museums, he said. ``They don't say what is
contemporary. They say, `This is art. Up yours.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And the man widely credited with the invention of the
blockbuster exhibition has no patience for what he labels
``mini-blockbusters,'' the trumped-up exhibits of obscure minor
masters beloved of scholarly curators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catalog is a curatorial ego trip. You can't read it, and
it's too heavy; it's too expensive,'' Hoving said. But he also
objects to the strategy of inundating people with the familiar as a
way to engage them with art.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't do it by every ... minute another impressionist
show. Please. It's a nice movement, but it's a second-rate movement
in the history of art. We can't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoving, however, can be disingenuous about the business of
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he wrote the lead essay in the catalog for a huge
traveling retrospective of American illustrator Norman Rockwell,
now in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, Hoving said his interest in Rockwell follows the
postmodernist approach to images as ``cultural texts,'' which can
be analyzed to yield interesting information about the society in
which they were made. It is a trend that has encompassed
exhibitions of all manner of low- and second-rate art forms.
</P>
<P>
   However, the difference between ``sociologically interesting''
and ``aesthetically significant'' goes unexplored in Hoving's essay
on Rockwell, leaving the dummies he is so concerned to educate
about connoisseurship free to believe that Rockwell is to be
received in the same manner as Rembrandt.
</P>
<P>
   Advice and anecdotes
</P>
<P>
   Following on the heels of his 1997 coffee-table-sized tome,
Greatest Works of Art of Western Civilization, Art for Dummies
represents the latest installment in Hoving's ongoing crusade to
get others to share his passion.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first questions he addresses in Art for Dummies is
``what a fine work of art should do for your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer: ``It sets your blood racing. It changes your life
for the better every time you look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   His definition of the object of his affection is equally
straightforward: ``Art is when anyone in the world takes any sort
of material and fashions a deliberate statement with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoving devotes the first three chapters of Art for Dummies to
appreciating art. He includes the predictable advice of ``looking,
looking and more looking'' as the best way to train the eye, as
well as some less common tips.
</P>
<P>
   In the section headed ``How to Visit a Museum the Way the Pros
Do,'' he recommends visiting the museum shop first. Whatever the
country, museum shops always carry postcard reproductions of their
best works. With these as a guide, one can efficiently set out to
visit the highlights, and even in a country where one doesn't speak
the language, flash a postcard at a guard to receive directions.
</P>
<P>
   What keeps this book lively are the periodic insertions of tips,
cautions, explanations of art lingo and anecdotes. Like rest stops
along the highway of art history, they are identified by little
graphic icons _ a bull's-eye with an arrow for a tip, a bearded
figure with glasses wearing a beret for an anecdote.
</P>
<P>
   Among the latter, the item headed ``It Pays to Go With a Famous
Person _ the Likes of Jackie Onassis'' is one of the best,
recounting Hoving's burrowings through the bowels of the Hermitage
with Onassis and ``Soviet cultural nabobs'' in search of the winter
sledding cape of Princess Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
   The cape was wanted for a Russian costume show at the Met, but
the Soviets, fearing that it would engender memories of Lenin's
massacre of the czar and his family, said it had vanished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie turned on the right pout,'' Hoving writes. As a result,
not only the cape but the princess' sled were found and lent to the
costume show.
</P>
<P>
   A chapter on the Renaissance includes a blurb about the cleaning
of the Sistine, in which Hoving participated by cleaning a
1-foot-square area. The experience convinced him that the cleaning
was not destructive to the ceiling, as some critics had argued.
</P>
<P>
   Old art for upper-middle-class dummies
</P>
<P>
   Art for Dummies was six months in the writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started in January, and I had to be finished by June 30,''
Hoving said. ``Then I had to get rid of the Ph.D. language, the
professional jargon, the shorthand, the easy professional stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many generalist museum directors, Hoving is most
comfortable with masterworks. He admits that the book's sole nine
pages devoted to contemporary art are skimpy, in part because
contemporary art is not his area of expertise.
</P>
<P>
   Despite enthusiastic passages devoted to British painter Jenny
Saville, whose fleshy nudes are featured in the Brooklyn Museum's
``Sensation'' exhibit, and Gary Simmons, praised by Hoving as ``the
most powerful social commentator in art of his generation,'' this
book would be more appropriately titled Old Art for
Upper-Middle-Class Dummies.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is an assumption that the reader has a good bit
of money, in the chapters geared to collecting and in offhanded
suggestions of what to do ``should you find yourself in Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoving himself characterizes his intended audience as ``people
who bypassed art when they went to school and learned engineering,
computer science etc.; people who have museum experience but are
still a little frightened and don't want to ask the wrong question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them ask every wrong question, right away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoving is at his entertaining and informative best when it comes
to discussing specific artworks and his own experiences of them.
(When he travels, he carries with him a couple of tiny monotypes of
clouds by a New York artist named Wendy Mark, which he props up in
his motel room much as other people might set out family
photographs.)
</P>
<P>
   Hoving's chapters on collecting, on the other hand, with their
references to purchasing masterworks and the problem of fakes,
don't ring true. It is hard to imagine someone with the budget and
interest to pursue Old Master artworks taking their advice from a
beginner's manual like Art for Dummies.
</P>
<P>
   Hoving's advice to ``collect living artists'' seems
better-suited to his target audience. But in typical Hoving style,
he prefaces his list of ``living artists who are in the prime'' _
Wyeth, Rauschenberg, Frankenthaler and others _ with a smart-alecky
little dig at museum culture:
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you should buy one of them now,'' he writes, ``so your
grandchildren can dangle their wills before the covetous eyes of
the biggest museums in the land, and be wined and dined for the
rest of their lives at the homes of wealthy museum trustees.''

   ``I do not think it necessary to believe that the same God who
gave us our senses, our speech, our intellect, would have put aside
the use of these, to teach us instead such things as with their
help we could find out for ourselves, particularly in the case of
these sciences of which there is not the smallest mention in the
Scriptures; and, above all, in astronomy, of which so little notice
is taken that the names of none of the planets are mentioned.
Surely if the intention of the sacred scribes had been to teach the
people astronomy, they would not have passed over the subject so
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, Galileo's letter, which was widely copied and
distributed throughout the world, caused a rethinking of the
relationship between science and religion. But to many others,
particularly a number of ambitious firebrand priests and Jesuits,
Galileo's logic was criminal. It resulted in his first trial for
heresy and forever branded him a controversial figure.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of his trials, his constant battles with various
infirmities, and efforts to complete his books, Maria Celeste
becomes a constant source of moral and emotional support. Galileo
describes her as ``a woman of exquisite mind, singular goodness,
and tenderly attached to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Rarely conveying bitterness about her own exile to the convent
in which she was placed at age 12 after being deemed unmarriagable
because of her illegitimacy, Galileo's daughter brightens the
astronomer's life with loving correspondence, bracketed with tales
of the difficulties of her monastic existence and even humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She appears to be quite a different nun than others in the
convent and she seems to know that,'' Sobel says.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter, she asks her father to visit in order to repair a
clock that he has fixed several times but that continues to break
down, telling Galileo that ``these nuns won't let me live'' if it
is not repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seems to set herself apart from the other nuns in several
of the letters,'' Sobel says.
</P>
<P>
   Often apologetic for dashing off the letters in haste, Maria
Celeste takes turns as a typical child, buttering up her father
before asking for money:

   30 August 1631
</P>
<P>
   Most Beloved Lord Father
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If the measure or indication of the love one bears another
person is the trust vested in the loved one, then you must never
doubt, Sire, that I love you with all my heart, as in truth I do;
since I draw such confidence and security from you that at times I
fear I exceed the bounds of modesty and filial devotion, and all
the more so as I know you to be beset by many worries and expenses.
Nevertheless the certainty I have, that you will minister ever so
much more willingly to my needs than to those of any other person,
even including your own, lets me dare to ask you if you would be so
kind as to relieve me of a worry that weighs heavily on my mind,
regarding a debt I owe of five scudi incurred during Suor
Arcangela's illness, as I was constrained during these four months
to spend with largesse, compared to the economy that befits the
poverty of our station: and now that I find myself desperate and
pressed to repay the loan, I come to the one I know is willing and
able to help me. And also I want a flask of your white wine to make
a strengthening tonic for Suor Arcangela, who I think will be
better served by her faith in this remedy than by the remedy
itself.
</P>
<P>
   I write with so little time that I cannot possibly say more,
except that I hope you enjoy these six almond pastries, and I send
you my love.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
From San Matteo, the 30th day of August 1631. &QL; 
Your most affectionate daughter, &QL; 
S. M. Celeste &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The letters are often heartbreaking,'' says Sobel. ``But they
amount to one of the greatest stories I've ever encountered.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Celeste died in the convent at age 33, probably from
dysentery, pulling Galileo into a tailspin of grief from which he
may have never fully recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel immense sadness and melancholy,'' he told a friend.
``Together with extreme inappetite; I am hateful to myself, and
continually hear my beloved daughter calling to me.''
</P>
<P>
   In failing health, nearly blind, unable to recieve visitors or
attend Mass, and with the spectre of heresy over him, Galileo lived
his last days struggling to complete two more scientific journals
on astronomic observations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Pope John Paul II, said to be fascinated with astronomy
and Galileo in particular, decided to reopen the Galileo case and
called for a commission to investigate the episode that led to the
astronomer's trial and condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is the current Pope so interested in Galileo?'' Sobel
says. ``I think it's because of this popular perception that we
ascribe to Galileo. So if we can show this isn't true, that it
wasn't a fight between the Church and Galileo's ideas, but between
the person of Galileo and the person of Pope Urban, and the
Jesuits, it does the Church a great deal of good.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, on the 350th anniversary of Galileo's death, the
Pope admitted the Church had erred and conceded the popular notions
of what happened at the time were inaccurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Galileo case has been a sort of `myth,' in which the image
fabricated out of the events was quite far removed from reality,''
the Pope declared. ``In this perspective, the Galileo case was the
symbol of the Church's supposed rejection of scientific progress,
or of `dogmatic' obscurantism opposed to the free search for
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   There are indeed places where science and religion can
intersect, the Pope said, exactly as Galileo declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clarifications furnished by recent historical studies
enable us to state that this sad misunderstanding now belongs to
the past,'' the Pope concluded in a written statement. ``From the
Galileo affair we can learn a lesson which remains valid in
relation to similar situations which occur today and which may
occur in the future.''

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``MY GARDEN (BOOK)''  &QL; 
By Jamaica Kincaid (FSG, $23) &QL; 
Jamaica Kincaid has written books full of her difficult feelings
for her mother and her brother, but boy, does she love her garden.
She is agitated and vexed when she's in it, but she's happy:
``Nothing works just the way I thought it would, nothing looks just
the way I had imagined it, and when sometimes it does look like
what I had imagined (and this, thank God, is rare) I am startled
that my imagination is so ordinary.'' This book is dense with
growing things, overrun with blooms, fertile with every plant
you've ever heard of and then some. Fellow gardening author Michael
Pollan says Kincaid's voice is that of ``an exquisitely attentive
gardener thinking out loud.'' We'd note that ``exquisitely
attentive'' is a kind way of saying ``obsessed,'' but then it's all
New &AMP; Notable can do to water the tomatoes. Kincaid celebrates seed
and plant catalogs, discusses the link between gardeners and
conquerors, and notes that ``everyone I have ever met who has a
garden has something growing in it from seeds that were gathered in
Monet's garden.'' That means she cultivates exotic friends, too. &QL; 
``THE BOOK BORROWER'' &QL; 
By Alice Mattison (Morrow, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This odd and meandering novel begins with the meeting of two
young mothers at a park in 1975. Deborah Laidlaw is there with her
daughters, Toby Ruben with her baby son, and in the course of their
conversation Toby borrows a book that Deborah has been carrying
around but has not found time to read. Two things begin in this
scene: a lifelong friendship between Toby and Deborah, and our
interest in the fate of that borrowed book, ``Trolley Girl,'' the
story of a tragedy that occurred during a strike among trolley
workers in 1921. For much of her novel, Mattison alternates the
interplay between Toby, Deborah and their families with sections
narrated by the author of ``Trolley Girl.'' We're not sure why she
does this but we're grateful for it, because ``Trolley Girl''
proceeds with a sense of purpose and anticipation. The ground is
not so firm under Toby and Deborah, whose friendship unfolds in
rambling conversations and unseen resolutions. One chapter ends
with a terrible conflict between the two friends when Toby almost
gets Deborah fired from her teaching job. To our surprise, the next
chapter begins years later, with their friendship obviously
restored, although Mattison does not say how. This is exasperating,
but ``The Book Borrower'' is not without saving graces. One is Toby
Ruben, an authentic character who slips into mean-spiritedness when
she feels threatened. Another is Mattison's portrayal of the give
and take between friends, between men and women, between parents
and children _ that messy navigation of emotional ties. In the end,
her novel is less notable for its story than for these small
moments that ring true. &QL; 
``IF THIS HOUSE COULD TALK'' &QL; 
By Elizabeth Smith Brownstein (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found that it is the visible, the tangible, that goes a
long way in softening prejudices,'' Booker T. Washington wrote in
``Up From Slavery.'' ``The actual sight of a first-class house that
a Negro has built is 10 times more potent than pages of discussion
about a house that he ought to build, or perhaps could build.'' And
so, against the wishes of some of his benefactors, Washington built
``The Oaks,'' a red brick house with parlor, library, dining room,
kitchen, family and guest bedrooms, den, breakfast room, five
bathrooms and a veranda on three acres of land overlooking the
campus of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute. Among the other buildings
included in this look at historic homes and the people who lived in
them are the stunning ``symphony in wood'' built in 1908 (for a
mere $55,000) for Proctor &AMP; Gamble heir David Gamble in Pasadena,
Calif.; the New Hampshire farm of poet Robert Frost; Lorenzo
Hubbell's house and trading post in Ganado; the Massachusetts
homestead of Rebecca Nurse, who was hanged during the Salem witch
trials; the Bronx, N.Y., cottage of Edgar Allan Poe; and Frank
Lloyd Wright's Storer House and Auldbrass Plantation. Our favorite
is illustrator Edward Gorey's Cape Cod cottage, where books are
piled precariously high on every horizontal surface in sight. This
engaging blend of history, architecture and interior design
contains what its author calls ``stories of great passion, courage
and brilliance . . . and enough cruelty, greed and ignorance to go
around.'' &QL; 
``THE COST OF LIVING'' &QL; 
By Arundhati Roy (Modern Library, $11.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roy follows her Booker Prize-winning first novel, ``The God of
Small Things,'' with two essays, one on dam projects that have
scarred her native India and the other on India's detonation last
year of a nuclear bomb. The first, called ``The Greater Common
Good,'' is more demanding reading, but both benefit from Roy's very
personal and appealingly abrasive style. In the second essay, ``The
End of Imagination,'' she touches on the success of her novel.
``The more I thought about it,'' she writes, ``the clearer it
became to me that if fame was going to be my permanent condition it
would kill me. Club me to death with its good manners and hygiene.
I'll admit that I've enjoyed my own five minutes of it immensely
but primarilyBECAUSE (editor: ITAL) it was just five minutes.
Because I knew (or thought I knew) that I could go home when I was
bored and giggle about it. Grow old and irresponsible. Eat mangoes
in the moonlight. Maybe write a couple of failed books _
worstsellers _ to see what it felt like.'' Instead, she has written
this, a thought-provoking challenge from a citizen of India and of
the world. &QL;

PREPARING A PORTFOLIO FOR THE LONG HAUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I, aged 60 and 64 respectively, are retired. We
get $40,000 yearly in teachers' retirement and Social Security, and
need to draw about $30,000 from other sources to meet our needs. As
part of that, I now work part time and earn about $10,000 yearly. I
would like to quit this in two years. I also have deferred
compensation of $10,000 a year, which will continue for the next
six years. The rest of the income must come from our investments.
We have $45,000 in CDs, investment property valued at about
$100,000 that produces $2,500 yearly, $90,000 in IRA equity fund
accounts, and $460,000 in a mutual fund portfolio that consists of
52 percent equity funds and 48 percent fixed-income funds. Are our
funds appropriate to our age and goals? Will this portfolio provide
for us for the next 25 to 30 years? How should we withdraw from
this portfolio as we need money?
</P>
<P>
   R.C., Valley Center, Calif. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I guessed that your yield from your fixed-income holdings
averaged 6 percent, and that you were getting a 2 percent yield
from your various equity funds and 5 percent from your CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding in the real estate income, this would bring you $24,582 a
year in yields, without calculating any additional portfolio
growth. That amount is more than enough to meet your needs until
age 70, when the deferred compensation income stream runs out.
</P>
<P>
   I then made a sequence of calculations based on the assumption
that you achieved average annual portfolio returns of 7 percent,
and that you withdrew at a rate of $833 a month for the next two
years and then at a rate of $1,666 a month for the next four years.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation came out with a total portfolio of $923,391 at
age 70 _ the point at which you would need to begin withdrawals of
$2,500 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Even though at some point inflation will probably dictate that
you increase your levels of withdrawal, chances are you will have a
sufficient buffer so that your portfolio will continue growing
despite the higher withdrawals. You'd need total returns of less
than 3.5 percent to support those $2,500 monthly withdrawals at age
70 with no portfolio erosion.
</P>
<P>
   The wild card here is that real estate. Clearly, since the
investment is bringing you a yield of only 2.5 percent, you
anticipate capital gains, but the uncertainty there might make that
7 percent assumption of total portfolio growth either low or high.
But it's probably a safe, and perhaps conservative, assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, most people would consider the portfolio makeup, which
includes only 38.3 percent on the fixed-income side, to be a bit
too aggressive for a fellow your age.
</P>
<P>
   But given your particular circumstances, with the earned and
deferred income meaning you will make little call on your portfolio
for the next six years, I think it's just fine.
</P>
<P>
   My only suggestion along these lines is that during those six
years when much of your yield will be available for reinvestment,
that those reinvestments go on the fixed income side.
</P>
<P>
   If you follow that practice, chances are good that you will
never have to liquidate fund positions, but can simply draw from
the yield of your holdings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 70-year-old retired widow with a yearly income of
$45,000, with a small yearly increase tied to the Consumer Price
Index. From that I save $600 a month in a money market account,
which currently stands at $15,000 and earns 4 percent interest. My
home is mortgage-free with a current value of $350,000. I maintain
$2,500 in my checking account. I have the following investments,
none of which is needed for additional income: a $100,000 401(k)
balance, $87,000 in bank IRAs at 6.5 percent maturing in 1902,
$140,000 in bank CDs at 5.2 percent maturing this year, and a
$39,000 variable annuity in growth stocks. I need to move my 401(k)
money into some type of IRA account this year, and I must begin
taking minimum distributions on this and my IRAs. I want to invest
the distributions each year. My concerns are inflation and taxes. I
have been considering various stock and bond funds in the Vanguard
and American fund families. I can assume a small amount of risk,
but am uncertain how to allocate my investments to minimize taxes
and keep ahead of inflation. Can you suggest some stock or bond
funds for my 401(k) and the yearly distributions?
</P>
<P>
   E.S., San Diego &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Although you say you are willing to assume a small amount of
risk, when I consider that your current lineup consists of just
over 10 percent stocks, I'm going to consider that the operative
word there is small.
</P>
<P>
   So here's what I suggest.
</P>
<P>
   With the 401(k) money I suggest a rollover into a Vanguard bond
fund portfolio, with 25 percent each in Vanguard's Prime Money
Market and Short-Term Corporate Bond funds, and with the balance in
Vanguard GNMA fund.
</P>
<P>
   The latter two of these funds do represent some risk, but are
excellent long-term holdings, providing solid yields and excellent
long-term records.
</P>
<P>
   To dip your toe into the stock market a bit, I suggest you put
the required distributions from the 401(k) and IRA accounts into a
balanced fund _ one that divides its investments between the stock
and bond markets.
</P>
<P>
   I would consider three funds _ Vanguard Star, Vanguard Balanced
Index, and American Balanced funds. Vanguard Balanced index is the
standout among the three, especially given your concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar Mutual Funds notes that low portfolio turnover has
made the fund tax-efficient. The fund is the only one of the three
with an above-average rating from Morningstar, and its record in
recent years has clearly outstripped those of its rivals. It
provides a yield of 3.30 percent, and has averaged 16.83 percent
annual returns over the past three years, and 17.52 percent over
the past five.
</P>
<P>
   Those periods have been exceptional years for the stock market,
but I think that over the long haul, returns in the 8 percent to 10
percent range are a reasonable expectation.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be just a bit more aggressive _ without invading
your conservatively established portfolio _ you might transfer some
of the money that you have accumulated from your monthly savings
into the fund as well.
</P>

REDMOND HIT WHERE IT HURTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Tyler Oppenheim, a self-described computer whiz
at 16, has a theory about why the cineplex where he sells popcorn
was all but empty Friday night: Microsoft Corp. employees were too
stunned over the company being branded an evil empire to enjoy a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was packed for the early show, but then it just emptied
out,'' Oppenheim said. ``Three new movies were opening, but after
that it was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, Redmond had come roaring back to life. The Town
Center mall was crowded. A line snaked outside the movie theater.
Men and women competed on the Microsoft campus soccer field.
Traffic was stop-and-go as usual.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city with more than 17,000 Microsoft employees, where
everyone has a friend or relative working for the software giant,
an undercurrent of disbelief threatened to ruin the weekend. No one
could quite believe that a federal judge had declared Microsoft a
monopoly that used its power to reduce competition, sabotage
innovation, and harm consumers _ accusations that the people who
develop software, design graphics, and stand to become millionaires
at Microsoft called unfounded and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came across looking like big ogres, but you work there
every day and you see it's not like that,'' said Fabio Yeon, a
24-year-old software developer who joined Microsoft three years
ago. ``We're not the big bully. We don't win because we're so big.
We win because of our product and what we deliver to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Employee after employee displayed similar loyalty to Microsoft's
desktop computer operating systems and its challenging work
environment, although most refused to be identified. The company
asked them not to speak to the news media in the wake of Friday's
devastating ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the competitors that have sprung up in Redmond,
just northeast of Seattle, said they were surprised, confused, and
dismayed by the scope of the judge's condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say Microsoft is the best _ it's definitely not the
best _ but it saw the need, made the right product available, and
people bought it,'' said John Coyle, a software development manager
at another firm. ``I just can't understand it. How can you fault
somebody for being better at marketing?''
</P>
<P>
   The 207-page ruling issued by US District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson is not a final ruling but a declaration that he believes
the Justice Department's version of events. Attorney General Janet
Reno hailed the ruling as ``a great day for American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the historic antitrust case is far from over. A
settlement could yet be reached, although Microsoft spokesman Jim
Cullinan said the company stands by the core defense. Either side
could appeal the final outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who
``respectfully'' disagreed with the judge's decision, told
employees in a companywide e-mail that it's business as usual. The
average age of emplyees at Microsoft is 34.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `OK, don't worry, our legal team is handling this, go
back to what you do best. We don't believe this is a disruption to
our day-to-day operations or to what you do,' '' said Cullinan, who
lived out of a Washington, D.C., hotel during the trial, which
began in October 1998. ``We know if we don't keep working hard and
stay focused we may miss the paradigm shift in where this industry
is going next.''
</P>
<P>
   Those constant shifts _ a product is hot one minute, outdated
the next _ were frequently cited as evidence that no one can
monopolize the computer industry. Competition, Microsoft supporters
in Redmond said, comes from every corner. At Borders Books &AMP; Music,
a software engineer who is working on a top-secret new product for
Microsoft underscored that point by gesturing toward shelves of
computer books, many of them touting software offered by
competitors of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous competition out there, and we're losing on
a number of fronts,'' said the engineer, 25. ``I remember three
years ago we were losing the so-called browser battle. People take
it for granted today that we're number one, but an awful lot of
hard work went into making that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Jim Francis, 36, a former software developer whose stock
options enabled him to retire in March after eight years with
Microsoft: ``You have to go out of your way to make Microsoft into
a monopoly. You have to ignore everybody else. Obviously, this
judge doesn't feel obligated to give Microsoft a break on
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few can believe Microsoft won't triumph, even if many
conceded that Microsoft bungled much of its presentation before the
court. They can't believe the company could ever be forced to break
up along the lines of AT&AMP;T or Standard Oil. Some are so confident
that they say they haven't even bothered to follow the case closely
_ a difficult indifference in a region where every twist has been
front-page news and thousands are counting on Microsoft stock for
their children's college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I work with are more interested in getting the job
done than in politics,'' said a graphic artist who has been
designing computer games for Microsoft for 10 months. ``It's all
geeks, and that's what we care about. I heard about (the decision)
in the hallway and most of us treated it with a certain amount of
scorn. No one's taking it too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   That casualness, however, does not extend to elected officials.
From the governor on down, they have rushed to Microsoft's defense.
After all, they have come to rely on the taxes Microsoft pays as
much as local charities have come to rely on donations from Gates
and his employees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Boeing Corp.'s longtime presence in greater Seattle,
many described Redmond as rural before Microsoft set up shop in
1975. Net revenues for the fiscal year ending June 1999 reached
almost $20 billion; net income exceeded $7.7 billion. Microsoft
will match up to $12,000 a year in employee gifts, whether in the
form of computer software or cash. This year's in-house fund drive
raised more than $17 million, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, Microsoft is a good neighbor, although I don't
like what it's done to the local real estate market,'' said Redmond
native Shaun Whiteman, a Chrysler Corp. manager who's hoping his
Microsoft stock doesn't plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Added Andrew Bjorn, who lives on nearby Mercer Island and works
as a construction cost estimator: ``Microsoft is our economy. It's
our area. Lots of us work for Microsoft or know people who do. It's
only natural that we'd want it to go in there favor. No one would
be happy to see them hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they say that no one, not even the mighty Microsoft,
could dampen the competitiveness of the computer market. As Tim
Donovan, who works on Microft products at another software company,
put it, new technologies hit the market daily. But, he added, there
might be more if Microsoft was not so dominant. Then again, he only
moved to Redmond from Houston a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably shouldn't say this, but I take a little bit of
satisfaction in the decision,'' Donovan said. ``They're just so
huge. It's kind of like, `Ha. Just because you're that big you
can't rule the world.' ''

MICHAEL OATLEY: DISARMING THE CANDOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Calling Michael Oatley an IRA sympathizer is a bit of a
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that's what British conservatives and unionists in Northern
Ireland have dubbed the former British secret agent for his
recommendation that a local government in Northern Ireland be
formed without the Irish Republican Army giving up its weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily Telegraph, the voice of British conservatism and the
most outspoken advocate of retaining the union between Britain and
Northern Ireland, went even further, suggesting that Oatley had
become a ``degenerate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Oatley's recommendation on how to end the impasse over
paramilitary weapons that has stalled the peace process in Northern
Ireland for the past year, and bedeviled it for several more,
cannot be dismissed lightly.
</P>
<P>
   His is an opinion widely but privately shared in government
offices in London, Dublin, and Washington. Unlike Oatley, however,
officials and diplomats from the British, Irish, and US governments
are wary of making such a blunt assessment, lest they be accused of
taking sides and appearing insensitive to unionist feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Oatley injected himself into the debate as George Mitchell, the
former US Senate majority leader, is scheduled to return to Belfast
this week for what will probably be his last push to fashion a
compromise to end the impasse. Mitchell is eager to get back to his
wife and young son and his Washington law practice. He has already
spent nine weeks, more than twice as long as initially envisioned,
trying to rescue the political settlement he brokered on Good
Friday 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Oatley, who served with MI6, the Secret Intelligence Service,
for 32 years and became its chief of counterterrorism in Europe,
had extensive clandestine dealings with the IRA leadership during
the 1970s. Some of the IRA leaders of that era, such as Gerry
Adams, the Sinn Fein president, and Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's
chief negotiator, are now the politicians who have tried to turn
the republican movement from one that uses violence to advance its
cause of a united Ireland to one that relies exclusively on
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists have refused to form a local government with Sinn Fein
until the IRA disarms, saying that if the republican movement is
truly committed to democratic politics, then it cannot maintain a
private army. That refusal has stalled the peace process and
threatens to unravel it.
</P>
<P>
   Oatley says the republican movement's leadership is sincere
about wanting to commit itself exclusively to politics. And he says
the ``no guns, no government'' argument being put forward by
unionists, and buttressed in London by the opposition Conservative
Party, is shortsighted and counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue, Oatley says, is not about guns but about the
willingness of the IRA to use them. Right now, he says, the
republican leadership has enough control over the IRA to keep the
guns away. But he suggests that if the impasse continues, and the
Good Friday Agreement is not implemented with the creation of a
power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, a majority in the IRA
will conclude that the peace process is a waste of time. The
implications are obvious.
</P>
<P>
   It is rare in Britain for former senior spies to publicly offer
their opinions on political issues, particularly one as sensitive
and as fluid as the current situation in Northern Ireland. But
Oatley is frustrated by what he sees as a misrepresentation of the
stalemate, and so took his message to those he thinks need to hear
it most.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Oatley wrote an opinion piece for the Sunday Times of
London. In it, he criticized the Times and the Telegraph, the
newspapers most vociferous in their support of unionists and their
condemnation of republicans, saying the right-wing press had
presented a false picture to the British public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Decommissioning is projected as the central issue in the peace
process. It is not,'' said Oatley. ``The question is not whether an
organization has, or can, obtain weapons. It is whether it will
choose violent or political action.''
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, Oatley said, ``are determined to portray the
deadlock on decommissioning as proof that Sinn Fein is cynically
insincere about its level of commitment to political action.''
Oatley calls this ``the picador approach to introducing a terrorist
organization to the attractions of the political arena.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If sufficient barbs are thrust into its flanks, the animal
will eventually, with reluctance, charge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oatley says that is what happened in 1996, when the IRA
concluded that the British government led by John Major was toying
with it by first saying Sinn Fein could take part in negotiations
if the IRA called a cease-fire, then adding the precondition of the
IRA disarming. The IRA broke its cease-fire, exploding a huge bomb
in London's Docklands section.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the politicians who say they don't trust the republicans,
Oatley has had extensive personal contacts with the IRA. Peter
Taylor, author of ``Behind the Mask: The IRA and Sinn Fein,''
describes Oatley as the most important British secret agent to have
worked in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Oatley helped arrange the short-lived 1975 IRA cease-fire. He
also helped resolve the 1980 IRA hunger strikes, the precursor to
the 1981 hunger strikes in which 10 republican prisoners died
seeking political status and violence increased dramatically as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   Before he retired in 1991, Oatley met secretly with McGuinness,
the former IRA chief of staff. Oatley's report on that meeting was
the first indication that the British government took seriously the
republican movement's intention to replace its ``armed struggle''
with a political one.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to pursue a political path, Oatley said, ``was
taken with trepidation by intelligent, ideologically committed
individuals who had spent their adult lives in pursuit of what they
regarded as a just war.''
</P>
<P>
   Oatley also shared the assessment of British military commanders
that the IRA could be contained but not militarily defeated. But he
said the IRA and its leadership also concluded that the British
government would not capitulate, leaving both sides to find a
negotiated settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Oatley considered it his duty as a British secret agent to
understand the mindset of those his agency targeted. But his
attempts to humanize the thought process of republicans has been
greeted with derision by British conservatives. The Telegraph was
moved to print an editorial, declaring that Oatley had gone soft.
</P>
<P>
   Oatley insists his solution is not based on partisan politics
but on experience in the real world. He says his job as a secret
agent required him to understand the motivation of his targets, and
to report on them objectively.
</P>
<P>
   He says he has done just that. Some don't buy his argument.
Others simply don't want to hear it.

MAKING THE PRESIDENTIAL GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The buzz is that George W. Bush isn't the sharpest
knife in the drawer. That his grades at Yale were mediocre. That he
can't pass a pop quiz naming the leaders of Chechnya, India,
Pakistan, and Taiwan. That he doesn't know Slovenia from Slovakia,
and that he can't tell a Greek from a ``Grecian.''
</P>
<P>
   The grades are great grist for the late-night comics. And the
quiz indicated that Bush may be vulnerable in a foreign-policy
debate. But opponents who try to exploit the issue of braininess
should beware: Americans like their presidents smart, but not so
intellectual that they can't reach down from their ivory tower.
</P>
<P>
   On that score, this political season offers them quite a choice:
Democrats Al Gore and Bill Bradley come off as a studious, cerebral
pair, the dutiful students who retain to this day a passion for
policy detail.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, across the political campus are Bush and John McCain,
the two leading Republicans, who admit that in college they often
walked right by the library to find the best fraternity party or
touch football game, or girls who wanted to have fun.
</P>
<P>
   So what will it be, America? A wonk or a gentleman's C?
</P>
<P>
   That has been a complex question for voters through the years,
and with reason: There is no clear correlation, in presidential
politics as in corporate life, between good study habits and
leadership success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overachievers don't do very well in the White House,'' said
Dean Keith Simonton, a psychology professor at the University of
California at Davis who wrote a book about the formation of
presidential prowess. ``Remember how annoying Jimmy Carter was,
always preaching and acting smarter than everybody else?''
</P>
<P>
   This year's crop of presidential postulants seems to remember.
Some of them, in fact, seem to be appealing directly to an
anti-intellectual strain that political scientists have long
identified in the American electorate. McCain frequently jokes
about his fifth-from-the-bottom finish at the US Naval Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gore, in going back to his roots, some days seems to act
more like a Tennessee hayseed than a Harvard man. And Bradley says
his pro basketball career was more life-shaping than was the
Princeton pedigree.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Bush, who certainly ranks in the Ivy League elite,
with his degrees from Yale and the Harvard Business School, but who
also has asserted that he was put off at both places by
``intellectual arrogance.'' At Yale, Bush passed every subject, but
he has made no secret of the fact that he frequently put football,
baseball, and his fraternity ahead of academics.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the New Yorker magazine published what it said was
Bush's Yale transcript. He had highs of ``88'' in philosophy and
anthropology, a low of ``69'' in astronomy, and many mid-70s scores
in between.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign spokesman, Scott McClellan, said that the New
Yorker ``stole'' the report, but then discounted it as
``irrelevant'' to the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unimpressive academic record,'' said Alan Lichtman, a
presidential historian at American University. ``If it shows that
Bush is intellectually incapable of doing any better, then I'm not
sure he is the kind of person I want in the Oval Office. If it
indicates he was simply interested in other things at college, then
the grades really don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Bennis, a business professor at the University of
Southern California, has spent 20 years studying what makes top
corporate leaders tick, and he is sure it is not their grade-point
average. ``Unless you are a moron, there is zero correlation
between grades or IQ and success in life,'' Bennis said.
</P>
<P>
   Ditto on SAT scores. Bush's, according to the New Yorker, were
in a respectable but not spectacular range: 566 on the verbal
score, and 640 for math, out of a possible 800 in each.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SAT is a remarkable judge of how well a student will
perform in college, but nothing beyond that,'' said Gaston
Caperton, the president of the College Board, which conducts the
SATs. Caperton, a former two-term governor of West Virginia, says
he is a good example of how grades don't make the man. He became a
successful politician despite his dyslexia, a reading disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skills that really help you in politics are having a huge
amount of energy and knowing how to get along with people,''
Caperton said.
</P>
<P>
   Academic achievement is not totally irrelevant, since it can be
a measure of focus, ambition, and discipline. But taking Bradley as
an example, Bennis said his success as a politician may have more
to do with the qualities that made him a great basketball star _
his timing, his intensity, his drive _ than with his Rhodes Scholar
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who graduated with honors from Harvard, may not derive
great political benefit from what voters perceive as his superior
intellect. In a recent debate, Gore said his biggest mistake was
saying he invented the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates who come off as some awe-inspiring Einstein will be
at a disadvantage if voters think they are too brilliant to work
with the masses,'' Simonton said. Gore may alienate people by
seeming so smart on issues like technology and science that
confound average Americans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Academic achievement has not necessarily resulted in popular
presidencies _ Carter's (Naval Academy) and Woodrow Wilson's
(Princeton, Johns Hopkins) spring to mind. Some of the nation's
favorite presidents, including Franklin Delano Roosevelt despite
his degrees from Harvard and Columbia, Ronald Reagan , and Harry S.
Truman, seemed to show that scholarship isn't required for
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was a Rhodes Scholar, yet he played up his
good-old-boy background in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who commanded the Allied
invasion of Europe in World War II, was no dummy, but his stump
rhetoric was deliberately homespun. He sometimes spoke in a
deliberately inarticulate way to confuse critics and make himself a
more appealing candidate. And for all his intellectual modesty,
Eisenhower certainly had no difficulty in twice trouncing Adlai
Stevenson, the self-consciously cerebral Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Once, while campaigning, Stevenson was flattered by a woman who
had told him he would get the vote of every thinking person. ``But
madam,'' Stevenson replied, ``I need a majority to win.''
</P>
<P>
   History also shows that presidents can get into big trouble when
they surround themselves with really smart people _ the ``best and
the brightest'' are sometimes blinded by their own intellectual
firepower.
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson, who seemed to have an intellectual
inferiority complex, leaned on the corps of advisers he had
inherited from the Kennedy administration _ men like Defense
Secretary Robert McNamara _ with disastrous results. Reagan put his
national security adviser, John Poindexter, first in his class at
the Naval Academy, in charge of the Iran-Contra arms sale episode.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was in the same Annapolis class, but at the bottom. He
writes in his memoir, ``Faith of My Fathers,'' that two things
brought his class rank down: terrible grades in math and science,
and very bad behavior. ``John wasn't intellectually sloppy,'' said
Frank Gamboa, who roomed with him at the academy, ``but he
deliberately did not try to excel.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's story, however, did not end at Annapolis, but continued
to Vietnam and into a Hanoi prisoner of war camp. He came back as a
hero, proving himself and rising above his undistinguished academic
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters are looking, above all, at authenticity because they
are fed up with handlers, pollsters, focus groups, and politics as
performance art,'' said Richard Norton Smith, director of the
Gerald R. Ford Library in Ann Arbor, Mich. ``There is something
refreshing about candidates who seem real, don't make exaggerated
claims, and seem perfectly comfortable in their own skin.''

<P>
   Child, a veteran of both the LA and New York music scenes, is
cautiously optimistic. ``Miami's sort of like the Wild West right
now. People are showing up thinking something's going to happen,
and maybe it will. It took a long time to build Music Row in
Nashville. There's a showcase every night there, people auditioning
for labels, and everybody comes out. In order for that to happen
here it has to be more like a village, not just kingdoms and
serfdoms.'' To that end, Child has started Songwriters in the
Round, a monthly gathering of local talent dedicated to fostering a
sense of community among Miami's musicians. Without that sort of
interaction, Child says, ``ideas will become stale, and you'll get
the same old sound.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a cautionary message that the industry at large should
heed. If record-label honchos with dollar signs dancing in their
eyes decide to exploit the moment to roll out copies of Ricky
Martin, a great opportunity will be lost. ``This is our chance,''
says Mauricio Abaroa, president of the Latin Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences. Abaroa came to Miami from Mexico City in 1996;
lately he's spent little time in LARAS's two-year-old Miami Beach
office between to trips to LA for screening-committee meetings and
trips to the 15 Latin American countries that are represented by
LARAS. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Carpeting the industry &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried that the industry leaders may not try to
understand our music, and they're an essential part of making this
happen,'' says Abaroa. ``Someone needs to let them know that they
have a big responsibility to find substantial talent. Jennifer and
Ricky and Marc and Enrique _ they are the best ambassadors. Now we
need to come in with all our roots, and all the power of our music,
and carpet the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Kike Santander, who's been Emilio Estefan's right-hand man since
1994, would like to lead the charge. A towering, 39-year-old former
doctor, Santander proudly shows off the just-finished recording
studio at his waterfront home, where he's currently producing four
new acts that he hopes will keep Latin music in the US mainstream.
``If you try to be somebody else, you are lost. I want to try to
create my own sound,'' Santander says, ``just as Emilio created his
own.'' Santander is so excited about one of his projects _ a cumbia
hip-hop band from Los Angeles _ he declines even to name it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a delicate balance, though, between promoting high-quality
art and feeding a profit-hungry commercial venture. While the
onslaught of Latin crossover artists may seem sudden, the process
has been ongoing, and executed with more forethought than one might
imagine, for years. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there have been plenty of crossover pockets that
were accidental things,'' says Jose Behar, president and CEO of EMI
Latin. Behar was born in Cuba and raised in Miami; in 1989, he made
crossover history by signing the late Tejano singer Selena to his
label. Her 1995 English-language album, ``Dreaming of You,'' became
the first album by a Latin artist ever to enter the Billboard
charts at No. 1. ``Santana's `Evil Ways,' or `La Bamba,' musical
events dating all the way back to Xavier Cugat, none of those,''
Behar points out,``were planned out.'' (Carlos Santana, by the way,
is enjoying the biggest hit of his 30-year career right now;
``Supernatural'' has been at No. 1 for three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Then in the late '80s, Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound
Machine introduced Cuban rhythms to the US mainstream with a string
of Latin-flavored pop singles. That, Behar says, was a critical
turning point. ``When Gloria crossed over, it was Emilio's vision.
He planned it and made it happen. And then of course we were
looking for another Gloria, to sell to this new bicultural
consumer. When Selena crossed over, it sent a red alert through the
system: There's a business here. Around the same time Jon Secada
happened, and it was written in stone. Gloria, Selena, Jon . . .
the time gaps became compressed. It established the fact that the
market was there if you delivered the right product. Now you see
the phenomenon of Ricky and Jennifer and Marc Anthony, and I must
give credit to my competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Tommy Mottola, president of Sony, who threw the
full force of his label's resources behind the careers of Martin,
Lopez, and Anthony. Many feel that it was Mottola who really had
his finger on the pulse, who recognized the massive consumer
potential of the burgeoning US Latino population. ``That was
brilliantly, brilliantly planned,'' says Behar. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Opposed to the hype &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely the perspective that makes Marc Anthony
bristle. The 30-year-old salsa singer recently released his debut
English-language album, which is No. 13 on the Billboard album
charts this week. ``I Need to Know,'' a twitchy, salsa-flavored pop
track, is a huge hit, holding steady at No. 6 after nine weeks on
the Hot 100 singles charts. ``I feel so caught in the hype. It
disturbs me to even think about, that I might have been accepted
because I'm Latin and not by the merit of my music,'' says Anthony,
who became widely known several years ago when he starred in the
ill-fated Broadway production of Paul Simon's ``The Capeman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very weird moment. So many people are getting it so
wrong. It's pop music! I grew up listening to Gloria Gaynor and Air
Supply. If I had more African influences I'm sure it would have
shown up. But I'm from New York. I'm Puerto Rican. I'm both,''
declares Anthony, who recently began work on his next salsa album.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he concedes that there's a silver lining to all the hype.
``I'm glad that Latinos in general feel like this might be their
chance to express themselves. I just beg them not to do it because
it's the chic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their motivations, there's no shortage of Latino
musicians from every region, and every genre, lining up to explore
the possibilities. EMI Latin has 12 new artists _ Tropical, Rock,
Latin Rap, and Mexican rock _ slated for release in the next
quarter. Universal Music has seven Latin artists releasing albums
in the next four months. Welterweight boxer Oscar De La Hoya begins
sessions at Rudy Perez's house later this month for his debut
album, a bolero-pop collection due out next spring. Colombian star
Shakira is poised to make a huge crossover splash. And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   While there's no denying the impact of the rapidly growing
Latino youth population, the Anglo audience is buying Latin music,
too _ and not just Ricky Martin records. ``The perception a few
years ago for Anglos was that Latin music was mariachi. Restaurant
music. Great for a party,'' says Jose Behar. ``What's happened now
is it's been hipified. It's hip to like Latin music.'' Desmond
Child concurs: ``Ricky showed everyone how fun and cool and sexy it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Anglos are opening their ears to Latin music beyond
radio-ready pop. ``When I speak to an American and ask him to
describe Latin music, the first word out of his mouth is `passion,'
'' says Mauricio Abaroa _ a feature of Anglo pop and rock that's
admittedly grown dimmer and dimmer. ``That's what the crossover
phenomenon has done: It's enabled the Latin music world to expose
itself, its many flavors, and create the awareness it has long
deserved,'' says Behar.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says Abaroa, ``we are at the crossroads. The mainstream
American market is turning to us and saying, `What is this?' Now it
must be good talent. Fresh talent. I hope they don't churn out 10
more Rickys and 10 more Jennifers.'' And if they do? ``Both ways
will climb, of course. But one will only have results for five or
six years. The other,'' says Abaroa with great hope, and not a
little determination, ``will last a long, long time.''

US RISKS LOSS OF INFLUENCE IN UNITED NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even if Washington coughs up its back dues to the
United Nations, the United States has seen a precipitous loss of
influence in the institution it created from the ashes of World War
II, according to the UN leadership and ambassadors from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The senior UN officials predicted that the new US ambassador,
Richard Holbrooke, would face renewed hostility, no matter what the
outcome in Congress on UN arrears, over a US demand that it pay a
smaller share of UN costs.
</P>
<P>
   And, unless the back pay issue is resolved within seven weeks,
the costs kick in quickly under UN bylaws. For example, American
companies may be barred from bidding on millions of dollars in UN
contracts. US vendors now take home 47 percent of UN purchases. The
United States also would lose its vote in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the UN leaders said, the United States, which
even named this institution, risks its ability here to sway other
nations to its point of view. The world body has long been a pillar
of US foreign policy, helping the United States, for instance, to
build a worldwide coalition against Iraq's Saddam Hussein after his
troops invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Deep damage has already been done. ``Member states are in a
quandary because there is no leader here now,'' said Joseph E.
Connor, undersecretary general for management and an US citizen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leader,'' Connor said, referring to the United States,
``is on the sidelines. . . . I wonder sometimes if the Iraq war
effort, which was handled so well by Tom Pickering, could be done
today.'' Pickering, the former ambassador to Russia, is a longtime
State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   The anxiety and anger toward the US Congress for holding up
nearly $1.7 billion in arrears, according to UN calculations,
became clear during meetings with UN Secretary General Kofi Annan
and 14 of his top deputies over two days last week. But it is also
apparent from conversations with ambassadors and from UN committee
meetings, including one Oct. 5 on back payments that turned into a
slam session against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At that budget committee meeting, the British ambassador, Jeremy
Greenstock, said the United States had ``muffled its voice and
stained its reputation,'' according to UN minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Annan told a group of US journalists last week that ``the
organization needs the United States, and the United States needs
the organization.'' America, he said, ``has a natural leadership
position, which in some ways it has forfeited.''
</P>
<P>
   The secretary general, who assumed his office largely because of
a strong US push for UN reforms, said he doubts Congress would
appropriate $926 million toward the debt. ``We will believe it when
we see the check,'' Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Reform efforts, which have cut more than 1,200 jobs in the UN
secretariat to about 8,800 positions, have been paralyzed because
of the US debt, said John G. Ruggie, assistant secretary general
and a US citizen. ``You can't talk about reform in this place
today'' because of anger toward the United States, Ruggie said.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Miyet, undersecretary general for peacekeeping
operations, said he believed it was in the national security
interests of the United States to pay for UN operations that defuse
crises without involving American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best reason for the Americans to pay their dues,''
Miyet said. ``You mobilize other countries to do the job in
difficult situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, only 36 of the more than 14,000 UN peacekeepers are US
soldiers, according to US officials. That number, while pleasing to
some members of Congress, has angered several ambassadors here who
see it as another example of the United States not doing its part
of bringing stability to areas of conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Another UN source, an American speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said it was ``painful to be an American at the UN these
days. We are losing our moral authority. . . . The UN is not a
lapdog to be summoned upon convenience. If we do not lead, others
will fill that vacuum. When Congress attacks the UN, it weakens the
institution and it weakens ourselves, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In Congress, the issue is now at a crossroads, its future likely
to be determined in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the Senate passed legislation sponsored by the chairman
of the Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, a North Carolina
Republican, that would pay some of the arrears in exchange for a
stringent reform program and a reduction in US payments to 25
percent of UN peacekeeping operations from 31 percent, and to 20
percent of overall UN operations from 25 percent. That bill passed
97-2.
</P>
<P>
   But attached to House legislation is an unrelated amendment from
Representative Christopher Smith, a New Jersey Republican, that
would forbid abortion-rights groups from lobbying foreign
governments. Smith, under pressure to compromise by a Republican
leadership concerned about being branded isolationist, doesn't seem
in a mood to back down. `It's time for accommodation'' from the
White House, he told reporters Friday. President Clinton has vowed
to veto any bill that contains the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Smith argues, accurately, that the United States remains the
United Nation's largest benefactor. He says that the body should
write off much of the amount due _ the bulk of it for peacekeeping
_ because the Pentagon has contributed billions of dollars in
voluntary contributions for such operations in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers believe that the United States pays far too much
toward foreign operations, including UN dues. Representative Sonny
Callahan, an Alabama Republican and chairman of the House
Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, complained last
month that ``every time somebody walks in the White House with a
turban on his head,'' the president offers them money.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said he was going to ``buy me one of those turbans''
and seek money for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   While most Americans know it for the UNICEF Halloween boxes, or
the war of words inside the building among countries at war, the
institution carries out a mind-numbing number of missions. They
include reducing the threat of nuclear war, overseeing thousands of
peacekeepers around the world, condemning human rights violations,
fighting for environmental protections, and trying to save the
lives of children around the world _ a fight, like the others, that
seems endless. Last year, UNICEF estimated that 12 million children
died needlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To pay its bill, the United Nations assesses each country a bill
determined by its wealth, based on gross domestic product. Under
the formula, the United States accounts for 27 percent of the
world's wealth; under the Helms legislation, the US portion would
reduce to 20 percent in three years.
</P>
<P>
   In the US mission's 12th floor dining room, with a view of UN
headquarters, Holbrooke last week told reporters that the United
States ``can't have that leadership at the United Nations unless we
pay our debts.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbooke said he is spending three days a week in Washington to
lobby Congress. And while he said his fellow UN ambassadors have
been personally supportive, his position is exceedingly difficult
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine standing in my shoes,'' he said. ``How embarrassing it
is to give advice all day long and not getting the resources to
back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be much worse, though, if Congress doesn't pay part of
the dues by year's end. If that happens, he said, ``we will be just
stumbling through the next year and a half'' until the next
president takes office.

FIONA APPLE: TRYING TO MAKE HERSELF PROUD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Fiona Apple was younger _ she's still only 22 _ she had
rules for herself. One was ``to always question my motives.''
Another was ``to always make myself proud of myself.'' She has
struggled along the way _ for years she didn't even tell her
friends she was writing songs _ but that changed when she sold 3
million copies of her debut album, ``Tidal,'' which came out in
1996. She was only 19 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Apple took some lumps from critics who called her a ``waif'' and
said she popularized the trendy ``heroin chic'' look. But Apple
threw a few jabs of her own when she got up at the MTV Video Awards
in 1998 and said, ``You shouldn't model your life on what you think
we think is cool, and what we're wearing and what we're saying. . .
. Go with yourself, go with yourself!''
</P>
<P>
   The outburst got her branded a loose cannon, but she has no
regrets about it. ``I am proud of myself for everything I did last
time,'' she says from her new home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The famously self-reliant Apple is back with her second album,
which comes out Tuesday. Its title is the longest in pop history.
It's from a poem she wrote and helps sum up her world view.
Although the title has already been satirized in a few
publications, Apple says it's preferable to those ``three-word
album titles that sound like movie names.''
</P>
<P>
   Here it is: ``When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a
King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Ring
There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You
Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the
Greatest of Heights and If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know
Where to Land and If You Fall It Won't Matter, Cuz You'll Know That
You're Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the poem when I was on the road and getting a lot of
backlash,'' she notes. ``It was a way of saying that no matter what
happens, even if you do make a mistake, even if you do fall down,
you do know where you stand, and it doesn't change who you are. And
even if everyone says you're wrong, if you know you are right,
you're still right.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple is much happier this time around. She just bought a house
in Los Angeles with her boyfriend, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson,
who wrote and directed ``Boogie Nights'' and has a new movie,
``Magnolia,'' due in Boston early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I got off the road, I finally settled down and have
friends and have a life now,'' says Apple. ``It's quite different
from how it was before. I felt like I was in the middle of nowhere
before. It's a lot more stable this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple, who toured for two years to back her debut disc (which
featured the megahit ``Sleep to Dream''), grew up on Manhattan's
Upper West Side before signing a recording contract when she was
18. That came after she gave a demo to music publicist Kathy
Schenker, who works with Sting and Peter Gabriel. Schenker passed
it on to Wallflowers manager Andy Slater, who loved it and opted to
manage Apple's career.
</P>
<P>
   An overnight success story, Apple wove magical piano-pop songs
exuding street credibility. Her deep, cutting voice also belied her
years. It was hard to believe that she grew up listening to mostly
jazz acts and the Beatles, while never being a fan of pop radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't listen to music at all now,'' she says. ``That makes
it feel strange sometimes, because music is really not a part of my
life unless I'm doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did she attend many concerts as a youth _ she only recalls
seeing Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross, and she sat far away in both
cases. ``I just did not understand why anybody would want to go and
be there when they could listen (at home) and actually hear the
music. . . . And that still enters my mind when I am on stage. It's
like, `I don't understand why they are here, because some of them
are obviously having trouble hearing and seeing me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Apple had no frame of reference when she started playing her own
shows after her debut CD took off. ``I had to improvise a lot
because I had never performed before,'' she says. ``It just seemed
impossible to think, `Oh my God, I'm going to have to go on stage
and carry a show.' . . . I would ask my bandmates about what other
people do. Do they talk between songs? When I first went out, I
felt really weird and fake for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple, who won't tour until February (though she'll likely do
some radio-sponsored Christmas shows), is feeling much more
confident these days. However, the new album, like its predecessor,
still has a lot of moody love songs, though the quality is again
high. And there's only one ``happy-ending song,'' she says. It's
``I Know,'' a string-laden ballad that could fit into Carly Simon's
songbook. Otherwise, the tunes don't rock as hard as those on the
first album but are better crafted, with help from ingenious
producer/multiinstrumentalist Jon Brion, the former Bostonian who
has worked with Aimee Mann.
</P>
<P>
   The album, with expanded sound textures and strings, should
smash any notion of a sophomore jinx. Still, it's surprising that,
despite her success, there's only one happy-ending tune. That's
because, like many other writers, Apple works best when she's upset
rather than in bliss. That's reflected in the new single, ``Fast As
You Can,'' with its admission, ``I may be soft in your palms, but
I'll soon grow hungry for a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like getting angry and kicking a hole in your wall,'' she
says of composing songs. ``When I write, it's usually because
something has'' angered her. ``I'll sit down at the piano and feel
better about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing as therapy, then?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she says. ``And the fact that it's become a career is
just a very profitable side effect. But, you know what? I'd be
doing it anyway.''

MOVIES RECENTLY REVIEWED IN THE BOSTON GLOBE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
!! 1/2 ``Bandits'' Four women break out of a German prison van and
take it on the lam _ to a pounding rock score that expresses their
anger, but makes the film seem an overextended music video. It's
too sentimental and ultimately too empty to take very seriously,
but its partying energies and embattled verve make it hard to
dislike. (R) 
 
!! 1/2 ``The Bone Collector'' Denzel Washington keeps us focused on
his quadriplegic cop threading his way through a maze of clues left
by a grisly serial killer. Angelina Jolie impressively makes us
feel everything her rookie cop feels, acting as Washington's eyes
and ears on the streets and in the sewers. But the body parts never
quite come together in this dark thriller. There's not enough
texture, and the ending is a letdown. (R) 
 
!! 1/2 ``The Insider'' Ungainly in its structuring, pacing, and
pile-driving technique, this film nevertheless tells an important
story forcefully and arrestingly. Two stories, really _ one about
big tobacco being called to task, the other about how complicated
muckraking has grown since Watergate. Russell Crowe is compellingly
complex as the tobacco-company researcher who blew the whistle, but
the story's moral center is Al Pacino's TV producer, who fights to
get the story aired in undiluted form. Christopher Plummer's
flamboyant Mike Wallace is a plus, too. (R) 
 
!!! ``Show Me Love'' This endearing little teen film plays like a
Beatles film without the Beatles. It takes place in a Swedish
backwater and is propelled by director Lukas Moodysson's empathy
with the desperate boredom afflicting its characters, especially
Alexandra Dahlstrom's little pepperpot and Rebecca Liljeberg as
Agnes, who wants to be a writer. Brighter than the rest, Agnes is
suffering because of it, and because she's unable to figure out how
to tell Dahlstrom she's crazy about her. (Unrated)

`BESIEGED' TOP BERTOLUCCI; `BLACKTOP' IS TERRIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW RELEASES: ``Besieged'' _ Bernardo Bertolucci, the director
of great films such as ``The Conformist'' and ``Last Tango in
Paris,'' returns to the subjects of politics, love, and loyalty.
Superb camerawork and complex characters make this a profound
turnaround from such silliness as ``Stealing Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two-Lane Blacktop'' _ When the road movie, starring pop
performers Dennis Wilson and James Taylor, was released in 1971, an
Esquire cover story proclaimed it the film of the decade. It's not.
But it is a terrific movie directed by the wildly underrated Monte
Hellman. The soundtrack is superb, and the widescreen remaster is
gorgeous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Broken Vessels'' _ As far as I know, this independent film
didn't have a theatrical release and is heading straight to video
even after winning the Audience Award at the Los Angeles Film
Festival. The story of two paramedics has its problems, but it's a
fascinating character study that goes over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resurrection'' _ NBA fans can spot former Celtic, now Laker
Rick Fox, in this routine, gimmicky action film starring the
laconic Christopher Lambert, who is upstaged by a car chase.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DVD UPDATE: Jim Carrey's ``Liar Liar'' ($35) is better on disc
because it includes a deleted opening scene and some zany outtakes
of Carrey's carrying on. Director Tom Shadyac, who provides helpful
commentary, is as quiet and shy as Carrey is loud and boisterous.
It makes for a winning team.
</P>

US RISKS LOSS OF INFLUENCE IN UNITED NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even if Washington coughs up its back dues to the
United Nations, the United States has seen a precipitous loss of
influence in the institution it created from the ashes of World War
II, according to the UN leadership and ambassadors from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The senior UN officials predicted that the new US ambassador,
Richard Holbrooke, would face renewed hostility, no matter what the
outcome in Congress on UN arrears, over a US demand that it pay a
smaller share of UN costs.
</P>
<P>
   And, unless the back pay issue is resolved within seven weeks,
the costs kick in quickly under UN bylaws. For example, American
companies may be barred from bidding on millions of dollars in UN
contracts. US vendors now take home 47 percent of UN purchases. The
United States also would lose its vote in the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the UN leaders said, the United States, which
even named this institution, risks its ability here to sway other
nations to its point of view. The world body has long been a pillar
of US foreign policy, helping the United States, for instance, to
build a worldwide coalition against Iraq's Saddam Hussein after his
troops invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Deep damage has already been done. ``Member states are in a
quandary because there is no leader here now,'' said Joseph E.
Connor, undersecretary general for management and an US citizen.

DID YOU HEAR THE ONE ABOUT THE ELECTION? 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Maybe you think Tom Ammiano versus Willie Brown
is going to be a po litical version of the San Francisco Stand-up
Comedy Competition.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you think this will be all fun and games, one wild and
crazy liberal versus a wilder and crazier liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the surprises in the San Francisco mayor's race, the
biggest surprise is yet to come. Two of the wittiest, quirkiest,
meanest show-offs in America have to play it straight.
</P>
<P>
   We're in for a five-week civics lesson. Forget the mud. Last
week's election proved San Francisco is tired of personal attacks.
</P>
<P>
   How is Brown consultant and master mudballer Jack Davis going to
attack Ammiano before the Dec. 14 runoff?
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano doesn't seem to have any skeletons in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, he isn't in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates are in a serious race, competing for serious
moderate voters, and they have to seriously debate the issues _
public transportation, taxes, the homeless, government waste,
development, insider deals and the almost impossible cost of living
here.
</P>
<P>
   Debating issues may sound improbable in San Francisco, where
politics are dirtier than the streets. But it could happen. Odder
things have. On Oct. 12, I predicted Ammiano would launch a
write-in campaign and throw the election into a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I was exaggerating when I said that Brown might not be in
the runoff. But isn't it great that he got a big wake-up call?
</P>
<P>
   All politics is personal, particularly in San Francisco where
liberals stab each other in the back because there are no
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   We've already heard the first discouraging words.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblywoman Carole Migden, a Brown ally, was quoted Friday as
saying, ``With Tom, you don't even know if he can get up for
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Migden said she was just talking, as she does so readily, and
regretted saying it.
</P>
<P>
   I checked Ammiano's attendance at Board of Supervisors'
meetings. In the last four years he missed only four meetings, an
outstanding attendance record.
</P>
<P>
   Just so we have things clear before the race starts in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing. This is not precisely a contest between a man who
would uplift the poor and working class and a man who would crush
them under the wheels of developers' BMWs.
</P>
<P>
   This is a race between two kinds of liberals. Brown is a more
traditional liberal who sees development and business as engines
that create jobs for diverse ethnic and labor constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano is a more radical type, reminiscent of the kind of
students who took over deans' offices in the 1960s. In a speech at
City Hall Thursday, he even used the phrases ``participatory
democracy,'' ``the belly of the beast'' and ``class,'' as in social
class, not world-class.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Brown's election-night party was by far more
ethnically diverse than Ammiano's, and Brown swept such
working-class and poor neighborhoods as the Excelsior and
Bayview-Hunters Point.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano rides public transportation. Brown rides in a limo.
However, both remember their roots, Ammiano as a gay kid growing up
in working-class New Jersey, and Brown as an African American kid
growing up in rural Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Both have strong social consciences _ although one knows more
socialites.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be comparing Brown's record on the homeless and public
transportation with Ammiano's ideas on dealing with the homeless
and public transportation. We'll hear about Brown's improvements in
public housing and Ammiano's efforts to control rents and limit
evictions.
</P>
<P>
   We'll hear a lot about the practicality and fairness of
Ammiano's proposed ``living wage.'' We'll hear about that Ammiano
plan to tax those who make over $150,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Big business may paint Ammiano as a Bolshevik, but the runoff
comes down to a choice between two visions of a city.
</P>
<P>
   In the Brown vision, San Francisco is filled with high steel and
chain stores generating profits and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Ammiano vision, San Francisco is a smaller, freer,
cheaper place, the city young people yearned for in the '60s and
'70s. Of course, it'll have to meet the political correctness
standards of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Ammiano made CNN and Kathie Lee, but he has a long way
to go before he's as famous a politician as Willie Brown. He has
won four citywide elections, though, and served in plain view of
the public on the Board of Education and Board of Supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   Brown spent years as the most powerful legislator in California,
but from a safe district where voters followed him in Herb Caen's
column.
</P>
<P>
   In his election night speech, Brown said he never knew how tough
being mayor would be. He also never anticipated how tough being
re-elected would be.
</P>
<P>
   Last week was a real exercise in democracy. The little guy with
a box of pens humbled the big guy with a box of money.
</P>
<P>
   Now we get down to serious business.
</P>
<P>
   How many comedians does it take to run for mayor? Answer: That's
not funny.

REDMOND HIT WHERE IT HURTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Tyler Oppenheim, a self-described computer whiz
at 16, has a theory about why the cineplex where he sells popcorn
was all but empty Friday night: Microsoft Corp. employees were too
stunned over the company being branded an evil empire to enjoy a
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was packed for the early show, but then it just emptied
out,'' Oppenheim said. ``Three new movies were opening, but after
that it was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, Redmond had come roaring back to life. The Town
Center mall was crowded. A line snaked outside the movie theater.
Men and women competed on the Microsoft campus soccer field.
Traffic was stop-and-go as usual.
</P>
<P>
   But in a city with more than 17,000 Microsoft employees, where
everyone has a friend or relative working for the software giant,
an undercurrent of disbelief threatened to ruin the weekend. No one
could quite believe that a federal judge had declared Microsoft a
monopoly that used its power to reduce competition, sabotage
innovation, and harm consumers _ accusations that the people who
develop software, design graphics, and stand to become millionaires
at Microsoft called unfounded and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came across looking like big ogres, but you work there
every day and you see it's not like that,'' said Fabio Yeon, a
24-year-old software developer who joined Microsoft three years
ago. ``We're not the big bully. We don't win because we're so big.
We win because of our product and what we deliver to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Employee after employee displayed similar loyalty to Microsoft's
desktop computer operating systems and its challenging work
environment, although most refused to be identified. The company
asked them not to speak to the news media in the wake of Friday's
devastating ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the competitors that have sprung up in Redmond,
just northeast of Seattle, said they were surprised, confused, and
dismayed by the scope of the judge's condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't say Microsoft is the best _ it's definitely not the
best _ but it saw the need, made the right product available, and
people bought it,'' said John Coyle, a software development manager
at another firm. ``I just can't understand it. How can you fault
somebody for being better at marketing?''
</P>
<P>
   The 207-page ruling issued by US District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson is not a final ruling but a declaration that he believes
the Justice Department's version of events. Attorney General Janet
Reno hailed the ruling as ``a great day for American consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the historic antitrust case is far from over. A
settlement could yet be reached, although Microsoft spokesman Jim
Cullinan said the company stands by the core defense. Either side
could appeal the final outcome.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, Microsoft chairman Bill Gates, who
``respectfully'' disagreed with the judge's decision, told
employees in a companywide e-mail that it's business as usual. The
average age of emplyees at Microsoft is 34.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said, `OK, don't worry, our legal team is handling this, go
back to what you do best. We don't believe this is a disruption to
our day-to-day operations or to what you do,' '' said Cullinan, who
lived out of a Washington, D.C., hotel during the trial, which
began in October 1998. ``We know if we don't keep working hard and
stay focused we may miss the paradigm shift in where this industry
is going next.''
</P>
<P>
   Those constant shifts _ a product is hot one minute, outdated
the next _ were frequently cited as evidence that no one can
monopolize the computer industry. Competition, Microsoft supporters
in Redmond said, comes from every corner. At Borders Books &AMP; Music,
a software engineer who is working on a top-secret new product for
Microsoft underscored that point by gesturing toward shelves of
computer books, many of them touting software offered by
competitors of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is tremendous competition out there, and we're losing on
a number of fronts,'' said the engineer, 25. ``I remember three
years ago we were losing the so-called browser battle. People take
it for granted today that we're number one, but an awful lot of
hard work went into making that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Jim Francis, 36, a former software developer whose stock
options enabled him to retire in March after eight years with
Microsoft: ``You have to go out of your way to make Microsoft into
a monopoly. You have to ignore everybody else. Obviously, this
judge doesn't feel obligated to give Microsoft a break on
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, few can believe Microsoft won't triumph, even if many
conceded that Microsoft bungled much of its presentation before the
court. They can't believe the company could ever be forced to break
up along the lines of AT&AMP;T or Standard Oil. Some are so confident
that they say they haven't even bothered to follow the case closely
_ a difficult indifference in a region where every twist has been
front-page news and thousands are counting on Microsoft stock for
their children's college tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people I work with are more interested in getting the job
done than in politics,'' said a graphic artist who has been
designing computer games for Microsoft for 10 months. ``It's all
geeks, and that's what we care about. I heard about (the decision)
in the hallway and most of us treated it with a certain amount of
scorn. No one's taking it too seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   That casualness, however, does not extend to elected officials.
From the governor on down, they have rushed to Microsoft's defense.
After all, they have come to rely on the taxes Microsoft pays as
much as local charities have come to rely on donations from Gates
and his employees.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Boeing Corp.'s longtime presence in greater Seattle,
many described Redmond as rural before Microsoft set up shop in
1975. Net revenues for the fiscal year ending June 1999 reached
almost $20 billion; net income exceeded $7.7 billion. Microsoft
will match up to $12,000 a year in employee gifts, whether in the
form of computer software or cash. This year's in-house fund drive
raised more than $17 million, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, Microsoft is a good neighbor, although I don't
like what it's done to the local real estate market,'' said Redmond
native Shaun Whiteman, a Chrysler Corp. manager who's hoping his
Microsoft stock doesn't plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Added Andrew Bjorn, who lives on nearby Mercer Island and works
as a construction cost estimator: ``Microsoft is our economy. It's
our area. Lots of us work for Microsoft or know people who do. It's
only natural that we'd want it to go in there favor. No one would
be happy to see them hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they say that no one, not even the mighty Microsoft,
could dampen the competitiveness of the computer market. As Tim
Donovan, who works on Microft products at another software company,
put it, new technologies hit the market daily. But, he added, there
might be more if Microsoft was not so dominant. Then again, he only
moved to Redmond from Houston a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably shouldn't say this, but I take a little bit of
satisfaction in the decision,'' Donovan said. ``They're just so
huge. It's kind of like, `Ha. Just because you're that big you
can't rule the world.' ''

<P>
   ALLAGASH, Maine _ Even in its best days, this city was an
outpost, the last cluster of lights on a road that plunges into
forest. Allagash is not on the way anywhere, and it thrived for a
hundred years in unusual cultural isolation; surrounded on all
sides by French-Canadians, its citizens still speak with a
Scotch-Irish burr.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Mainers about Allagash now, and they will know exactly
what you are talking about. Twice in the last year, a small group
of angry, unemployed woodsmen from this town blockaded the Canadian
border, accusing their government of allowing Canadian loggers to
steal their jobs and, ultimately, drive Americans out of the North
Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Their cry resonates powerfully in a thickly wooded region
surrounded on three sides by Canada, rekindling an old fear that
politicians downstate tend to forget that there are people up here
among the trees. Aroostook County juts into Canada like a
peninsula, bordering New Brunswick to the east and Quebec to the
west. As the farming economy declined between 1969 and 1994, the
county lost 14 percent of its population, even as neighboring Maine
counties gained comparable amounts, according to Robert Roper, who
teaches economics at the University of Maine in Bangor.
</P>
<P>
   Allagash's last stand is reminding people that towns can wash
away, that their children may seek work, or even build new lives,
far from the places their ancestors settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like this,'' said Hilton Hafford, 41, a leader of the
group of Allagash protesters. ``There's a certain amount of people
who were meant to live in Idaho, and there's a certain amount of
people who were meant to live in Allagash. That's why we were put
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Canadians have been allowed to work in Maine as long as they
were not taking American jobs. But Hafford and his fellow
protesters say that as the exchange rate has made Canadian labor
even cheaper, the system has broken down. Reacting to the protests,
state labor officials have ordered a study, the first since 1977,
to see what effect the Canadian workers are having on the wages of
Americans. The results are expected by mid-month.
</P>
<P>
   Hafford's critics, who include some in his town, assert that he
and his friends _ a small group that has ranged in number from five
to 12 _ have chosen protest over work. Department of Labor
officials argue that they have spent ``thousands of hours'' trying
to place the Allagash loggers in jobs, only to have them reject the
positions as low-paying or inferior.
</P>
<P>
   At root, many fault the Allagash men for resisting the economic
forces that sometimes require workers not only to update their
skills, but to leave their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   It is a familiar dilemma in the string of towns that line the
US-Canadian border. In nearby Fort Kent, traffic picks up at 2
a.m., as young men commute hundreds of miles for work downstate,
said Kim Doustou, executive director of the Fort Kent Chamber of
Commerce. And that is the young men who stay. ``Most of the kids
here fly right out of the area,'' according to John Paradis, 40,
who owns Doris's Restaurant in Fort Kent.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at a booth, Norman Bouchard, 65, agreed. He said the last
of his nine children, a lumber hauler, was about to sell his
equipment and move to another part of the state. ``The more you
talk to people around here, the more you'll realize something's
really wrong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A companion requested anonymity because he was afraid of losing
his job for a large lumber company. ``They call us crybabies,'' he
said, ``but there's no more living in the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   Allagash has endured a painful decline. In 1986, on the occasion
of its centennial, Allagash roasted a whole moose on a spit in
celebration; 10 years later, both its high school and elementary
school had shut down for a lack of students. Now scores of black
flies mill on the inside of a gymnasium window and across the
street; the old fire station is for sale. The population of
Allagash, which reached a high of 750 around the turn of the
century, fell to 242 in the last count, according to town selectman
Roy Gardner. Of those who are left, the average age is 65, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are almost no young men in town. On a recent evening,
Shannon McBreairty, 19, and Donna Bernier, 35, ate dinner together
at Two Rivers Lunch as both of their boyfriends had left town to
find work logging. Bernier's son, who is 19, also has left. Troy
Jackson, 31, who has joined Hafford in the protest effort, tried to
commute for a while, waking up every morning in the dark for the
long drive south to his job, but after a while his 3-year-old
learned how to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The oldest one used to hold my finger at night so I didn't
leave,'' he recalled. ``I drove five hours and you'd think about it
the whole way.''
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point, Hafford began to see the shrinking of
Allagash as a personal assault.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they were to hire hit men from New York and start at one
end of town and work their way saying, everybody leave this town,
that wouldn't go too good across the United States. But you see,
they're doing it little by little. It's subtle,'' said Hafford.
</P>
<P>
   When he and his friends give up the fight, trundling south to
find contract work in Connecticut, he added, there will be no one
left to argue for Allagash.
</P>
<P>
   ``What chance do we have of failure?'' he asked. ``The reason
we're here in the first place is we decided we wanted to live here
more than anyone else did.''
</P>
<P>
   But down Allagash's single road, selectman Gardner _ a direct
descendant of the man who founded the town _ sees a community that
has been overtaken by history as woodsmen with chain saws and cable
skidders were gradually replaced by well-educated operators of
complex machinery. His own children never had any desire to work in
the woods, and neither does his grandson, and it has less to do
with Canadian competition than the desire to find an easier, more
stable living. For his part, Gardner sees Allagash's future in
tourism and retirement homes _ both businesses he has entered.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be three or four logging camps in the area with
100 men in each of them. Today, every one of those camps are being
replaced by machines,'' said Gardner. ``That's nobody's fault.
Times are changing. You have to change with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the people of Allagash may have to accept that
resource-dependent industries make and break small towns. John
Cashwell, president of the Seven Islands Land Company, which
manages 1 million acres of woods in northern Maine, said he made
that point to a group of legislators and labor officials who
visited the North Woods to discuss the logging issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``One night I asked everyone standing there, `Who works in the
town that he grew up in?' and not a one, including me, raised his
hand,'' said Cashwell. ``If it's a one-horse town, and the horses
leave, what are you going to do? This is a group of people who feel
they have a right to stay in their hometown, and that's all right.
But it's not everybody else's fault if things don't turn out the
way they wish.''
</P>
<P>
   Try telling that to Hafford, who built himself a log house that
he cannot afford to live in.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Calvin, recognized his son early as a woodsman _
``He was quite . . . an outdoor fella. Anything he tried, he could
do,'' he said _ and Hafford does not take kindly to the idea that
his special talent is obsolete. Asked how far he is willing to take
this battle, he mentioned the war memorial in front of what used to
be Allagash's school. He said: ``You know the scary thing about it,
is I'm not sure.''

WALTER BENJAMIN AT THE DAIRY QUEEN 
Reflections at Sixty and Beyond 
By Larry McMurtry. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 204 pp. $21. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas may be the only province in the land where a man's
capacity for bull _ the activity, not the animal _ is considered a
thing of beauty. That holds true in a particular fashion for the
high plains of West Texas, which boasts none of the urban
treacheries (Austin's liberalism, Houston's pollution) of the more
civilized parts of the state. What you mostly see on the horizons
of West Texas are oil wells, grain elevators, and church steeples;
for the rest of culture, you generally have to look inward. This
partly explains why the region's artists and writers _ Buddy Holly
and Jimmy Gilmore, say, or Larry McMurtry _ all have a streak in
their work of sweet and private melancholy. When the watering
troughs are empty and the sun's moved on to California, what you
have to keep you company is the sound of your own imagination.
</P>
<P>
   That and the Dairy Queen, as requisite to Texas as the Eiffel
Tower is to Paris, and the place where, in small towns, guys go to
talk. After 30 years in the East, Larry McMurtry moved back to his
birthplace of Archer City, Texas, taking with him a huge personal
library of 20,000 books, another quarter-million to stock a
bookstore there, and more than 20 novels of his own _ among them
``Lonesome Dove,'' ``Terms of Endearment,'' and ``The Last Picture
Show.'' He may have been famous when he got back to Archer City,
but he still remembered where a man went to hang out.
</P>
<P>
   And read, which McMurtry has spent most of his life doing _
including his youth, when he was supposed to be helping his father
run cattle. Its title drawn from his reading the German critic's
essays at the DQ, ``Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen'' is an
amalgam of insight, speculation, personal history, and bull _ most
of it entertaining, some of it irritating, some of it provocative
and stirring. In this regard the book emulates McMurtry's work as a
whole _ as Texas's native son, the man has always been capable of
writing a wonderful novel one year and a castoff barnyard animal
the next. The mini-memoir he has gathered here is both erudite and
crankish; he can pontificate splendidly about the land or the sky
or his boyhood or Virginia Woolf, only to wander off a paragraph
later about, Lord help us, Cybill Shepherd (here, she's just
``Cybill'').
</P>
<P>
   The Walter Benjamin hook itself is a bit of a tease, though not
an unpleasant one. It's McMurtry's way of writing about the
necessity of story and the diminishment of oral narrative in modern
life _ the activity that belonged, in the Archer City of his past,
to discussions on the porch after supper: ``a dribble of family
history usually involving accidents, injuries, bad choices, good
choices, mistakes made with horses, misjudgments of neighbors, and
the like.'' What a fine definition! Except for those horses, he
could just as easily be describing ``King Lear.'' As romantic as it
is anachronistic, this porch tradition has now gone the way of
cattle drives and cowboys, supplanted by the gods of efficiency and
high-tech anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But McMurtry is no sentimentalist; one of the powerful assets of
his best fiction is its anti-pastoral quality. He knows that life
on the land is hard and even cruel _ that the sanitized,
Americanized myth of the cowboy is pure air-brushed delusion. He
remembers the well-regarded German dairy farmer who lived up the
road when McMurtry was a boy; the man got up and milked his cows
one morning, then put a shotgun to his head. McMurtry's own father
borrowed against his land and battled mesquite and prickly pear,
trying to get ahead while clinging to dying ways. ``My father, as
he neared the end,'' writes McMurtry, ``counted himself lucky that
he had owned a few good horses in his life and had sustained a good
name through seventy-six years.'' For a man who fought the land
most of his life in order to live on it, that had to be enough.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of McMurtry's fiction will be able to glean good details
and minor wisdom from this long and winding essay, but I wish its
author had worked harder to make our job less difficult. There are
moments of lovely recognition _ for this native Texan, it happened
when McMurtry described the ``sky longing'' Westerners feel forever
_ but there is also too much aimless pontificating; an editor, if
such a creature exists anymore, could have taken care of some of
the repetitions and dead-end trails.
</P>
<P>
   The most puzzling piece of ``Walter Benjamin'' is McMurtry's
brief account of the quadruple-bypass surgery he endured a decade
ago, and the trauma he suffered in its aftermath. Like a number of
heart-surgery patients, McMurtry lapsed into depression after he
had physically recovered; he was unable to read or do much of
anything but look out the window for more than two years. His
description of this period is wrenching, though he never goes near
the word ``depression,'' or suggests that there was anything to be
done about it. Instead, perceiving his affliction as a loss of
self, he seems to view it as inevitable _ believing that the
medical miracle of invasive surgery took its toll by nearly
annihilating the person inside the body.
</P>
<P>
   McMurtry is at his most relaxed and charming when he writes
about what he loves, or at least what he knows. Land and literature
seem to have fought over him from early on, but literature won, and
he went on to read everything under the sun and then add his own
work to the pile, writing about the land he had left behind. Like
his father, he's owned a few good horses _ ``Lonesome Dove,''
``Leaving Cheyenne,'' and ``In a Narrow Grave'' are three _ and has
hung on to his good name. As desultory and pleasant as the Pecos
River on a slow day, ``Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen'' is a
plentiful reminder of that.

 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ ``It was written with a baseball bat,'' is how one
Webhead recently described ``The Friends of Eddie Coyle,'' George
V. Higgins's gritty 1972 novel about the Boston underworld.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty much the most immaculate short crime novel ever
written,'' gushed another reader, comparing Mr. Higgins's mastery
of scene and dialogue to Ernest Hemingway's.
</P>
<P>
   Elmore Leonard, no slouch himself at bringing lowlifes to life,
showered similar praise on ``Eddie Coyle,'' gilding Mr. Higgins's
reputation as both a fan favorite and a writer's writer. A pro's
pro.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Higgins died of natural causes on Saturday at his Milton
home, at age 59. The lawyer-turned-author had long been regarded as
a Boston institution, an outsized personality in a city that
doesn't grow too many authentic giants these days. Whichever hat he
wore _ as journalist, prosecutor, media columnist, political
analyst, script consultant, or writing professor _ he wore it with
more style and flair than a dozen downtown lawyers or 20 Raymond
Chandler wannabes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This life's hard,'' he wrote in ``Eddie Coyle,'' the first of
Mr. Higgins's 26 novels (and 30 books all told), ``but it's harder
if you're stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Higgins was not stupid _ his lifelong faith in the Red Sox
notwithstanding. He was indeed a man of crackling intellect,
prodigious appetites, and extraordinary energy. He dressed
elegantly, spoke elegantly, and wrote elegantly, even (some might
say, especially) when roaming the roughneck neighborhoods of
Southie or Dorchester in his novels. An unabashed devotee of the
good life, he glided easily from Fenway Park to the Ritz, from the
Suffolk County Courthouse to Locke-Ober, from the cockpit of a
sailboat on Nantucket Sound to the wheel of a turbo-charged sports
car.
</P>
<P>
   Producing a novel each year for more than a quarter-century,
many of them classics of the suspense genre (``Cogan's Trade,''
``The Digger's Game,'' ``Kennedy for the Defense''), Mr. Higgins
managed to make his mark beyond the fictional realm of streetwise
punks and hit men. He wrote books, for instance, on two
politicians, Kevin White and Richard Nixon, who might have sprung
full-blown from Mr. Higgins's own fertile imagination if history
had not conceived them first.
</P>
<P>
   His novels were somewhat less warmly received when he relocated
them from the Boston underworld to Washington political circles, as
he did later in his career. But Mr. Higgins resented being typecast
as a genre novelist or one-trick pony, much as he battled with
publishing houses over compromises supposedly broached to make his
novels more commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one asked you to write,'' he once told a Boston University
writing class, distilling his view of the craft. ``And no one will
care if you stop. And if you succeed, no one will notice. It's a
rough, heartless business.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Higgins also firmly believed that bad writing could not pass
the sniff test of being read out loud, so he made his writing
students _ he spent a lot of time in the classroom after he quit
lawyering in 1983 _ read aloud from their work.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Higgins, his daughter, recalled how her father used to
read to her every night when she was a child. A favorite of theirs
was E.B. White's ``Charlotte's Web,'' and in particular Wilbur the
pig's feeling that Charlotte was ``a true friend and a good
writer.'' These words, Susan said Sunday, she will forever
associate with her father.
</P>
<P>
   John Higgins, Susan's brother, added that, ``Dad used to say
that what mattered was not how smart you were but how much you
knew. He knew quite a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Higgins contributed steadily to the Globe from 1979 to 1985,
during which he wrote some 300 columns slugged Amicus Curiae and
Lit'ry Life. His musings on the content and character of hundreds
of publications _ and writers _ were must-reads for anyone who
cared about journalism and popular culture. On Sept. 28, 1985, he
announced his retirement in quintessentially Higgins-esque style.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to stop,'' he wrote. ``I shall miss these weekly
outings, demurely slanging my betters in print, meekly exchanging
fond compliments with readers both approving and indignant,
indulging in respectful badinage with my fine editors, having a bit
of fun. But still and all: I have more books to write, several
promises to keep, some new ones to be made and some other things to
try. Nobody, as Clyde Barrow found out, should keep doing the same
thing too long _ they'll get a bead on you.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Human beings adjust to new circumstances so quickly that many
people now take for granted the changes that followed the breaching
of the Berlin Wall ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet few people, even in the remotest outposts, have not been
affected by the collapse of communism in 1989, a collapse
symbolized above all by the first rupturing of the wall on Nov. 9
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Words like momentous and historic, which too often litter the
prose of journalism, were for once appropriate. Truly, the world
has changed. Moreover, it has changed for the better.
</P>
<P>
   War did not stop then, nor suffering, nor oppression, nor even
history, though some pundits teasingly suggested it had. But an
idea _ that the common ownership of property contained the key to
human happiness _ was finally put to rest, and with it, in Europe
at least, a whole elaborate system of tyranny was swept away.
</P>
<P>
   In the most general sense, all the world benefited. The prospect
of nuclear war between the superpowers has now receded to such a
point that Paul Nitze, one of America's steeliest arms negotiators
in days gone by, can today propose the abolition of the United
States' entire nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Regional disputes, such as the endless Arab-Israeli one, no
longer threaten to destroy the world.
</P>
<P>
   An incubus has been lifted. Nowhere more so than in Europe.
Germany, divided for 40 years, is now one country, sovereign in
every sense and preeminent among its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   No longer on the front line of the Cold War, no longer infested
by the troops of its NATO allies, it has moved its capital from
Bonn to Berlin and with new self-confidence surveys a continent
ruled almost everywhere by democrats.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, places that were once synonymous with
totalitarianism, if not terror _ Romania, Bulgaria, Russia itself _
are now democracies, however flawed, intent on building market
economies.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem unduly generous to Russia, the center of so much
evil in the past, whose economy is largely a wasteland, whose
people often seem in two minds about democracy, and whose
government now wages a brutal war against its own Chechen subjects.
But just remember what went before: 74 years of communism and
centuries of czarist despotism.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the mid-1980s, few pundits expected the entire edifice
to tumble down, and fewer still predicted that, a decade later,
Russia would be holding regular and reasonably fair elections, amid
a cacophony of self-expression from media and politicians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Most astonishing of all, Russia has shed two empires _ the 14
republics that it had bludgeoned into submission within the Soviet
Union and the wider group of more recent conquests in East and
Central Europe. And all won their freedom virtually without loss of
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Blood has, however, been spilled as a result of communism's
collapse _ in former Yugoslavia, quantities of it. As long as an
iron hand throttled dissent, the uglier manifestations of tribalism
were held in check. When the grip was released, however, the
pent-up hatreds were also released.
</P>
<P>
   An equilibrium has yet to be found in the Balkans _ and in the
Caucasus _ suggesting that, unless NATO and other outsiders play
their part skillfully, there may well be more violence to come.
</P>
<P>
   It is less obvious that the wars in other parts of the world can
be attributed to the fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf war? It would certainly not have been fought as a
broadly consensual international affair, blessed by the United
Nations Security Council, had Russia still been Brezhnevite.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe a Russia of the old school would have tried to stop
Saddam Hussein from invading Kuwait in the first place. But had he
still done so, America would surely have resisted him, with
whatever allies it could muster. &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Africa's wars are of a different kind. The bloody demise of
Mobutu's Zaire, a regime kept in being largely for Cold-War
reasons, is perhaps the episode most similar to the demise of
Yugoslavia; it has helped to unsettle an entire region. But most
African wars are internal affairs in which one group is fighting
another for power and spoils.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these groups, in Angola, for instance, were exploited by
the great powers to prosecute the Cold War, but their quarrels were
seldom ideological and their desire to pursue them has outlived
communism. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In much of Africa, the main consequence of communism's end has
been a new indifference among outsiders, and an ensuing freedom for
states to wither or flourish independently.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is an exception. The death of communism removed the
last remaining pretext employed by those who wanted to call
themselves democrats for denying blacks their freedom. Had
communism endured, Nelson Mandela might still be in prison. The
transition to majority rule would certainly have been much
bloodier.
</P>
<P>
   A similar shift away from authoritarianism has taken place in
Latin America and even in Asia, the only part of the world in which
unreconstructed communists still rule.
</P>
<P>
   Though odd things may happen in places like Paraguay, Peru and
Venezuela, and though Cuba is still in the clutches of Fidel
Castro, the rest of Latin America, once home to caudillos and
all-but-closed economies, is now run by more-or-less democratic
governments, most of them committed to market economics.
</P>
<P>
   Asia too is far more democratic than it was. Indonesia is just
the latest, and biggest, country to move, however awkwardly, into
the democratic camp.
</P>
<P>
   True, China remains egregiously hostile to giving its people
political rights; North Korea is vile; Myanmar, Vietnam and
Cambodia not much better. Yet even their rulers must believe that,
in time, their countries are all destined to move towards, not away
from, the kind of democratic systems that now prevail elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the hiccups _ witness Pakistan _ no one can sincerely
believe that autocracy, let alone totalitarian communism, can
nowadays be a model for any country's political arrangements. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,000) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Such is the revolution that has overtaken the world. Yet this is
an odd revolution, and in one respect perhaps a disappointing one.
It is odd in that 1989 marked above all the failure of an idea, and
only secondarily the triumph of any other.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, democracy and market economics were the victors of
the Cold War, and in a sense therefore Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu,
Rousseau, Adam Smith and the rest have had the last laugh. But
these were the ideologues of the French and American revolutions,
two centuries ago. Surely, in their graves, they must now be
wondering why so few new ideas inspired or accompanied the
revolution of 1989?
</P>
<P>
   Some new ideas have been given a push. In the ten years since
the wall came down, an effort has been made to launch a new
internationalism.
</P>
<P>
   A new world criminal court is under way. Special tribunals are
in place to try those accused of war crimes in Rwanda and
ex-Yugoslavia. General Augusto Pinochet, now held in London, may
yet have to answer charges in Spain arising from his dictatorship
in Chile in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest departure of all is the concept of disinterested
armed intervention, as in Kosovo, where NATO went to war not to
defend a vital interest but to stop another country brutally
subduing one of its own provinces.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, the West tore up the code of international conduct
which forbids interference in the internal affairs of
nation-states, and which has prevailed since the Treaty of
Westphalia in 1648.
</P>
<P>
   This is new all right, and controversial, but it is hardly a
whole new political philosophy. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (END OF 2ND TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE, OR CONTINUE TO 1,375) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   In general, among the new converts to democracy and market
economics, as among the long-term believers, there is a marked
absence of both ideas and idealism.
</P>
<P>
   Communism had ceased to be a religion long before 1989, but its
departure seems to have left no void among the people who lived
under it.
</P>
<P>
   However splendid the past ten years' march towards democracy and
freedom, it will be sad if the slogan of the 1989 revolution
amounts to no more than ``Dialectical materialism is dead. Long
live materialism!'' &QL;

migration theory and come to terms with a more complex picture of
earliest American settlement. People may have arrived thousands to
tens of thousands of years sooner, in many waves of migration and
by a number of routes. Their ancestry may not have been only Asian.
Some of the migrations may have originated in Australia or Europe.

in days gone by, can today propose the abolition of the United
States' entire nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Regional disputes, such as the endless Arab-Israeli one, no
longer threaten to destroy the world.
</P>
<P>
   An incubus has been lifted. Nowhere more so than in Europe.
Germany, divided for 40 years, is now one country, sovereign in
every sense and preeminent among its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   No longer on the front line of the Cold War, no longer infested
by the troops of its NATO allies, it has moved its capital from
Bonn to Berlin and with new self-confidence surveys a continent
ruled almost everywhere by democrats.
</P>
<P>
   To the east, places that were once synonymous with
totalitarianism, if not terror _ Romania, Bulgaria, Russia itself _
are now democracies, however flawed, intent on building market
economies.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem unduly generous to Russia, the center of so much
evil in the past, whose economy is largely a wasteland, whose
people often seem in two minds about democracy, and whose
government now wages a brutal war against its own Chechen subjects.
But just remember what went before: 74 years of communism and
centuries of czarist despotism.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the mid-1980s, few pundits expected the entire edifice
to tumble down, and fewer still predicted that, a decade later,
Russia would be holding regular and reasonably fair elections, amid
a cacophony of self-expression from media and politicians alike.
</P>
<P>
   Most astonishing of all, Russia has shed two empires _ the 14
republics that it had bludgeoned into submission within the Soviet
Union and the wider group of more recent conquests in East and
Central Europe. And all won their freedom virtually without loss of
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Blood has, however, been spilled as a result of communism's
collapse _ in former Yugoslavia, quantities of it. As long as an
iron hand throttled dissent, the uglier manifestations of tribalism
were held in check. When the grip was released, however, the
pent-up hatreds were also released.
</P>
<P>
   An equilibrium has yet to be found in the Balkans _ and in the
Caucasus _ suggesting that, unless NATO and other outsiders play
their part skillfully, there may well be more violence to come.
</P>
<P>
   It is less obvious that the wars in other parts of the world can
be attributed to the fall of communism.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf war? It would certainly not have been fought as a
broadly consensual international affair, blessed by the United
Nations Security Council, had Russia still been Brezhnevite.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe a Russia of the old school would have tried to stop
Saddam Hussein from invading Kuwait in the first place. But had he
still done so, America would surely have resisted him, with
whatever allies it could muster. &QL;

<P>
   Africa's wars are of a different kind. The bloody demise of
Mobutu's Zaire, a regime kept in being largely for Cold-War
reasons, is perhaps the episode most similar to the demise of
Yugoslavia; it has helped to unsettle an entire region. But most
African wars are internal affairs in which one group is fighting
another for power and spoils.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these groups, in Angola, for instance, were exploited by
the great powers to prosecute the Cold War, but their quarrels were
seldom ideological and their desire to pursue them has outlived
communism. &QL;

   In much of Africa, the main consequence of communism's end has
been a new indifference among outsiders, and an ensuing freedom for
states to wither or flourish independently.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa is an exception. The death of communism removed the
last remaining pretext employed by those who wanted to call
themselves democrats for denying blacks their freedom. Had
communism endured, Nelson Mandela might still be in prison. The
transition to majority rule would certainly have been much
bloodier.
</P>
<P>
   A similar shift away from authoritarianism has taken place in
Latin America and even in Asia, the only part of the world in which
unreconstructed communists still rule.
</P>
<P>
   Though odd things may happen in places like Paraguay, Peru and
Venezuela, and though Cuba is still in the clutches of Fidel
Castro, the rest of Latin America, once home to caudillos and
all-but-closed economies, is now run by more-or-less democratic
governments, most of them committed to market economics.
</P>
<P>
   Asia too is far more democratic than it was. Indonesia is just
the latest, and biggest, country to move, however awkwardly, into
the democratic camp.
</P>
<P>
   True, China remains egregiously hostile to giving its people
political rights; North Korea is vile; Myanmar, Vietnam and
Cambodia not much better. Yet even their rulers must believe that,
in time, their countries are all destined to move towards, not away
from, the kind of democratic systems that now prevail elsewhere.

nowadays be a model for any country's political arrangements. &QL;

   Such is the revolution that has overtaken the world. Yet this is
an odd revolution, and in one respect perhaps a disappointing one.
It is odd in that 1989 marked above all the failure of an idea, and
only secondarily the triumph of any other.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, democracy and market economics were the victors of
the Cold War, and in a sense therefore Hobbes, Locke, Montesquieu,
Rousseau, Adam Smith and the rest have had the last laugh. But
these were the ideologues of the French and American revolutions,
two centuries ago. Surely, in their graves, they must now be
wondering why so few new ideas inspired or accompanied the
revolution of 1989?
</P>
<P>
   Some new ideas have been given a push. In the ten years since
the wall came down, an effort has been made to launch a new
internationalism.
</P>
<P>
   A new world criminal court is under way. Special tribunals are
in place to try those accused of war crimes in Rwanda and
ex-Yugoslavia. General Augusto Pinochet, now held in London, may
yet have to answer charges in Spain arising from his dictatorship
in Chile in the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest departure of all is the concept of disinterested
armed intervention, as in Kosovo, where NATO went to war not to
defend a vital interest but to stop another country brutally
subduing one of its own provinces.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, the West tore up the code of international conduct
which forbids interference in the internal affairs of
nation-states, and which has prevailed since the Treaty of
Westphalia in 1648.
</P>
<P>
   This is new all right, and controversial, but it is hardly a
whole new political philosophy. &QL;

   In general, among the new converts to democracy and market
economics, as among the long-term believers, there is a marked
absence of both ideas and idealism.
</P>
<P>
   Communism had ceased to be a religion long before 1989, but its
departure seems to have left no void among the people who lived
under it.
</P>
<P>
   However splendid the past ten years' march towards democracy and
freedom, it will be sad if the slogan of the 1989 revolution
amounts to no more than ``Dialectical materialism is dead. Long
live materialism!'' &QL;

   PHOENIX _ In Arizona politics, everybody has a favorite John
McCain story. One of them goes like this.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, having just moved to the state to begin his political
career, McCain was engaged in a bitter race for a seat in Congress.
One of his opponents called his ex-wife, fishing for dirt about the
candidate. When he heard of this, McCain cornered the man at a
gathering and told him: ``I want you to know that, campaign aside,
politics aside, you ever do anything like that again, anything
against a person in my family, I will personally beat the (crap)
out of you.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's temper is much in the news these days. It all
began in Arizona, where the governor, Jane Hull, has bucked
tradition by endorsing George W. Bush rather than the senator from
her own state.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hull told an interviewer that her relationship with McCain
was ``not particularly warm,'' and recounted the several times she
had felt the lash of his temper.
</P>
<P>
   Days later, a withering editorial appeared in the Arizona
Republic (a paper that has often sparred with the senator) which
noted how often he had called reporters ``liars'' and ``idiots''
and concluded by asking ``whether McCain has the temperament, and
the political approach and skills, we want in the next president of
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   A volcanic temper is hardly uncommon in American politics, let
alone among American presidents (the present incumbent has had
plenty of beet-red moments). Yet it poses a sizeable problem for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   He is now widely seen as the most formidable challenger to Bush;
but it is not good to be trailing Bush in his own state. Arizona's
primary, on Feb. 22, is essential to McCain's hope of ambushing the
Texas governor early in the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, a candidate can usually rely on a
primary victory in his home state. Yet Arizona is anything but
normal.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, over the past decade the state has drawn in a
great influx of immigrants from California and the East Coast. The
local football team, the Arizona Cardinals, often finds the
cheering in its own stadium louder for the other side.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is discovering that having an Arizona address is not
necessarily a seal of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Larger forces may also be contributing to his troubles.
According to Bruce Merrill, a professor at Arizona State
University, the national news media now dominate politics,
rendering a local advantage virtually irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Arizonans form their political opinions by
watching the same news programs as the rest of America, and
statewide polling largely mirrors polling for the country as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the troubling political implications of a close race in
Arizona, there are also serious financial considerations. McCain
will now have to devote precious money just to secure a victory at
home.
</P>
<P>
   With a name known throughout the state and three landslide
Senate victories under his belt, he will need to spend far less in
Arizona than he is currently devoting to New Hampshire and South
Carolina (the other early primaries he rests his hopes on); yet
even a moderately costly Arizona campaign could drain his coffers
for what comes afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hull's endorsement of Bush was probably for political
rather than personal reasons. A moderate Republican with a lot of
Democratic support, she is cut from much the same ideological cloth
as Bush, and the two have worked closely together on policy
concerning the border with Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nor may her preferences make much difference. Voters who turn
out at the primaries tend to be more conservative than the general
electorate, so the centrist Mrs. Hull may do little to enlarge
Bush's base of support.
</P>
<P>
   As for McCain, he has enlisted the help of a network of Arizona
politicians, including the popular speaker of the state's House, to
strengthen his position with Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He still has plenty of fans there, some of whom even appreciate
his temper. As Mark Spitzer, an Arizona state senator, says, ``You
damn well know where you stand with the guy.'' &QL;

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Baghdad by the Bay, a city that used to delight
in provoking the rest of the country, is at odds with itself.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans, for years so tolerant of each other's
eccentricities, are fighting among themselves about how people
should be allowed to live in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The cliff-hanging election for mayor and the clutch of
referendum propositions that were decided along with it on Nov. 2
were fought over strictly local worries: the state of Muni, the
city's public transport system; the number of homeless people on
the streets; whether or not to rebuild part of a freeway damaged in
the last earthquake, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying these issues, however, lay a more general unease
among San Franciscans that their city is changing for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of this deeper worry lie in global economic changes,
driven in part by the energy emanating from nearby Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Grappling with them should be the task of the next mayor, but no
candidate addressed the questions head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, San Franciscans will have another chance to push
for answers before making a final decision, since the failure of
any candidate to secure more than 50 percent of the vote means that
the two who did best (Willie Brown, the incumbent mayor, and
another yet to be decided) must compete in a runoff on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Until a month ago, the debonair Brown was sauntering towards an
easy reelection. Already a masterly political operator, with a
party machine tuned over his 14 years as speaker of the California
Assembly, he had used his four years in office to knit his classic
Democratic coalition of organized labor and local developers ever
more tightly together by doling out favors and riding the booming
local economy.
</P>
<P>
   His two main opponents competed with each other for the block of
older Irish-American voters whose roots they shared, and they
lacked Brown's powerful connections.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Frank Jordan, had been beaten by Brown four years
earlier after scuppering his credibility by inviting two radio
disc-jockeys to strip off and join him in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   The other, Clint Reilly, was a political consultant whose
reputation as a hothead _ he once broke an ankle during a punch-up
with the editor of the San Francisco Examiner _ Brown's campaign
staff took good care to nourish.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the final three weeks did things heat up, when Tom
Ammiano, president of the board of supervisors, as San Francisco's
city council is called, launched a campaign to persuade voters to
write his name on their ballot sheets, since it was too late for
him to enter as an official candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, whose first fame had been as a performer at a
homosexual comedy club he helped to found, is a rallying figure for
many of the more radical elements in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But his reputation for honesty in the supervisor's job, and his
promise of more open decision-making, won him support from a
broader range of voters who suspected that too many favors were
being swapped behind closed doors between the Brown administration
and its friends in business.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing investigation by the FBI of the way in which one of
Brown's supporters won city contracts reserved for minority-owned
businesses is the latest unsavory whiff from Brown's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has also caused a debate over the city's housing market.
The Internet gold rush of the past few years has increased demand
for living and working space in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent quarterly survey, the National Association of
Home Builders found that San Francisco continues to be the least
affordable city in America, with only 15.7 percent of the houses
sold in the past three months _ the lowest share in the country _
falling within the means of a family earning the local median
income of $72,400.
</P>
<P>
   Rents are high, too, double what they were four years ago; the
median rent is beyond the means of two-thirds of households.
</P>
<P>
   Evictions have risen fourfold since 1996, as owners seek to take
advantage of demand to install tenants ready to pay higher rents,
and the stock of cheaper housing has dwindled, with the demolition
of five public housing projects in the city adding to the pressure.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Baghdad by the Bay, a city that used to delight
in provoking the rest of the country, is at odds with itself.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans, for years so tolerant of each other's
eccentricities, are fighting among themselves about how people
should be allowed to live in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The cliff-hanging election for mayor and the clutch of
referendum propositions that were decided along with it on Nov. 2
were fought over strictly local worries: the state of Muni, the
city's public transport system; the number of homeless people on
the streets; whether or not to rebuild part of a freeway damaged in
the last earthquake, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying these issues, however, lay a more general unease
among San Franciscans that their city is changing for the worse.
</P>
<P>
   The causes of this deeper worry lie in global economic changes,
driven in part by the energy emanating from nearby Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Grappling with them should be the task of the next mayor, but no
candidate addressed the questions head-on.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, San Franciscans will have another chance to push
for answers before making a final decision, since the failure of
any candidate to secure more than 50 percent of the vote means that
the two who did best (Willie Brown, the incumbent mayor, and
another yet to be decided) must compete in a runoff on Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Until a month ago, the debonair Brown was sauntering towards an
easy reelection. Already a masterly political operator, with a
party machine tuned over his 14 years as speaker of the California
Assembly, he had used his four years in office to knit his classic
Democratic coalition of organized labor and local developers ever
more tightly together by doling out favors and riding the booming
local economy.
</P>
<P>
   His two main opponents competed with each other for the block of
older Irish-American voters whose roots they shared, and they
lacked Brown's powerful connections.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Frank Jordan, had been beaten by Brown four years
earlier after scuppering his credibility by inviting two radio
disc-jockeys to strip off and join him in the shower.
</P>
<P>
   The other, Clint Reilly, was a political consultant whose
reputation as a hothead _ he once broke an ankle during a punch-up
with the editor of the San Francisco Examiner _ Brown's campaign
staff took good care to nourish.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the final three weeks did things heat up, when Tom
Ammiano, president of the board of supervisors, as San Francisco's
city council is called, launched a campaign to persuade voters to
write his name on their ballot sheets, since it was too late for
him to enter as an official candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano, whose first fame had been as a performer at a
homosexual comedy club he helped to found, is a rallying figure for
many of the more radical elements in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But his reputation for honesty in the supervisor's job, and his
promise of more open decision-making, won him support from a
broader range of voters who suspected that too many favors were
being swapped behind closed doors between the Brown administration
and its friends in business.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing investigation by the FBI of the way in which one of
Brown's supporters won city contracts reserved for minority-owned
businesses is the latest unsavory whiff from Brown's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Ammiano has also caused a debate over the city's housing market.
The Internet gold rush of the past few years has increased demand
for living and working space in the city.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent quarterly survey, the National Association of
Home Builders found that San Francisco continues to be the least
affordable city in America, with only 15.7 percent of the houses
sold in the past three months _ the lowest share in the country _
falling within the means of a family earning the local median
income of $72,400.
</P>
<P>
   Rents are high, too, double what they were four years ago; the
median rent is beyond the means of two-thirds of households.
</P>
<P>
   Evictions have risen fourfold since 1996, as owners seek to take
advantage of demand to install tenants ready to pay higher rents,
and the stock of cheaper housing has dwindled, with the demolition
of five public housing projects in the city adding to the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Poorer families are moving to parts of town that are not yet
gentrified, or else across the Bay to other towns. More than a
third of the 800 families displaced by recent demolitions of public
housing no longer live in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Anger at the rising cost of living in San Francisco is often
directed at the ``dot.com'' people who move into formerly bohemian
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called Mission Yuppie Eradication Project fights the
class war by scratching the paint of BMWs and other smart cars on

   RICHMOND, VA. _ ``Democracy,'' cried James Gilmore, ``has
finally come to the commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Few could blame the Virginia governor, a Republican, for his
euphoria; Nov. 2 was the night when, for the first time,
Republicans took control of the General Assembly in the Old
Dominion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans elsewhere claimed this was proof that the famous
realignment that began in the Reagan era, more than a decade ago,
is continuing apace in the once-solidly Democratic South.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it? On closer inspection, almost the only thing Gilmore
and Virginia's Republican lawmakers have in common is their party
label.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans installed a majority in the House of Delegates and
preserved their edge in the Virginia Senate by emphasizing all
manner of local issues, few with any linking theme.
</P>
<P>
   A fierce opponent of abortion in the Washington suburbs turned
back a Democratic challenger for the House by suddenly embracing
controls on sprawl, a very un-Republican thing to do (property
developers are big local contributors to the party).
</P>
<P>
   In the resort city of Virginia Beach, Republicans defeated the
one remaining Democratic legislator by depicting him as a
double-dipper padding his income as a court-appointed overseer of
the financial affairs of the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican victory was also tempered by Democratic wins in
conservative pockets of the state, including the hills and hollows
of the southwest and the quiet coves and salt marshes of Chesapeake
Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia campaign thus made the point that, despite a bias
towards Republicanism, elections there remain largely nonpartisan
friends-and-neighbors affairs. And it showed Gilmore, who raised
and spent $3.3 million helping Republican candidates, that he will
still need to work hard to get his program through the General
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Virginia joined a tiny fraternity, becoming only the
second Southern state (behind Florida) with a governorship and
legislature controlled by the Republicans. Nationally, each party
now controls 20 state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, the Republican triumph in the Old Dominion gives the
party a crucial advantage in mandatory redrawing of legislative
boundaries in 2001. But elsewhere in Dixie, Democrats were crowing
on election day.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi governor's race ended in a dead-heat, possibly
leaving it to the Democrat-dominated House to pick the state's next
chief executive. The Democratic lieutenant governor, Ronnie
Musgrove, and a former Republican congressman, Mike Parker, were
separated by fewer than 7,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic legislators in Mississippi are itching for one of
their own, especially after eight years of a Republican, Kirk
Fordice, whose personal life has grown steadily stranger and who is
now in the throes of a tempestuous divorce.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic win in Mississippi could boost the party in the
Deep South, a vital battleground in next year's presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats won back the South Carolina and Alabama governorships
last year, and, with Mississippi, will have claimed two of the
three governor's races held in 1999. Democrats retained Kentucky
under Paul Patton, while Republican Mike Foster held Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that the South, home to the presidential
front-runners of both parties, seems such a mishmash suggests that
neither party has much of an advantage there _ or possibly in the
country at large.
</P>
<P>
   As Earl Black, a political scientist at Rice University in
Houston, Texas, puts it, ``No party goes into 2000 with a clear,
comprehensive national victory from these off-year elections.'' &QL;

<P>
   Ever since the collapse of communism, America has been casting
around for a new enemy. Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic
gamely volunteered for the role. But no great nation can define
itself against such tinpot figures.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans want to demonize China. But American business
is not willing to kiss goodbye a billion potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   As for Pat Buchanan's idea of going the whole hog and demonizing
all foreigners, it is rapidly turning him from a merely marginal
figure into an irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that these days Americans are keener on finding
their evil empires at home than abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign countries seldom impinge on people's attention, and when
they do it is more likely to be as a source of a nifty product than
as a military threat. But when it comes to giant companies that
make their living out of persuading people to consume noxious
substances, Americans are as vigilant as they were at the height of
the communist menace.
</P>
<P>
   With the release on Nov. 5 of Michael Mann's new film, ``The
Insider,'' big tobacco takes yet another step towards filling the
place once occupied by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the story of how it tried to silence Jeffrey
Wigand, a scientist turned whistle-blower, blackening his
reputation and using a threat of a $15 billion lawsuit to make CBS
drop an interview with him.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has been slow to join the anti-tobacco crusade,
perhaps remembering the golden days when Humphrey Bogart and Lauren
Bacall breathed clouds of cigarette smoke at each other. But this
film has Hollywood on the march.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson's silencing of Wigand proved to be a Pyrrhic
victory. The company's ruthless treatment of its former employee
was soon exposed in the press, and CBS, its tail between its legs,
finally screened its scoop. It was also one of big tobacco's last
victories in its long campaign to keep the media at bay.
</P>
<P>
   People who leave Mann's film thinking that tobacco companies are
still omnipotent organizations that can conceal evidence of the
effects of tobacco are as deceived as those CIA geniuses who
speculated that Yuri Andropov's Russia was pulling ahead of
America. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Big tobacco was already in headlong retreat by the time Wigand
made it to the screen. In ``Thank You for Smoking,'' Christopher
Buckley's 1994 satire of the tobacco wars (Random House), the
industry's public-relations machine is already a joke.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's chief ``smokesperson'' is about to lose his job
because of his failure to reverse the trend of public opinion. His
only comfort is his regular lunches with fellow self-described
``Merchants of Death'' from SAFETY (the Society for the Advancement
of Firearms and Effective Training of Youth) and the Moderation
Council (formerly the National Association for Alcoholic
Beverages).
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the defeat has become a rout. Smoking is banned in
most public buildings. In California you cannot smoke in bars; in
Davis and Palo Alto you cannot smoke within 20 feet of a public
building.
</P>
<P>
   The country is so plastered with anti-smoking ads, most of them
paid for by the tobacco industry as part of a $206 billion
settlement with the states, that Marlboro Man is becoming a symbol
of impotence and emphysema rather than rugged independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind if I smoke?'' asks an elegant young man on a popular
Californian billboard. ``Care if I die?'' replies his date. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   What the tobacco wars show is how feeble even the most ruthless
big businesses are compared with a newer force in American life:
the alliance of citizen activists, public-health officials and
trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The first shots in the tobacco wars were fired by citizen
activists. Ahron Leichtman founded Citizens for a Tobacco-Free
Society because the merest whiff of tobacco smoke gave him a
headache.
</P>
<P>
   John Banzhaf got so sick of advertisements featuring
``confident, rugged men smoking cigarettes'' that he founded Action
on Smoking and Health, ASH. (His motto, shown in abbreviated form
on his license plate is, ``Sue the bastards.'')
</P>
<P>
   These people became an unstoppable force when they linked up
with the medical and legal professions. The public-health
profession has been looking for a justification for its existence
ever since the communicable diseases that it was established to
fight were all but wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco provided just what it needed. And anti-tobacco lawsuits
are the legal profession's equivalent of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida state court's decision last month, in a case involving
500,000 smokers, that the jury can award punitive damages in a
single lump sum instead of deciding cases one smoker at a time
means that another gigantic ruling against tobacco companies may be
in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a danger _ drop your voice _ that the anti-smoking
crusade has gone too far?
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smokers are undoubtedly right to say that big tobacco
failed to come clean about the harmful effects of smoking (though
why people should choose to listen to the industry's advertisements
rather than the surgeon-general's health warnings is not clear).
</P>
<P>
   No doubt people should be educated about the ill-effects of
smoking. But, as the number of smokers inexorably declines,
disapproval has turned into intolerance, persuasion into outright
bullying.
</P>
<P>
   For many anti-smokers it is inconceivable that rational people
can understand the risks of smoking and still continue with the
habit. They must be either the slaves of addiction or the dupes of
the tobacco industry's propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude not only encourages anti-smokers to tolerate
grossly regressive taxes and even grosser infringements of
individual liberty. It also leads them to bring legal cases that
make a mockery of individual responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason why this should stop with smoking. What about
drinking? Many boozers share smokers' subversive belief that
quality of life is more important than quantity.
</P>
<P>
   What about skiing or paragliding? Both activities not only
involve risks to their participants but also costs to the people
who have to clear up after their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the national epidemic of obesity? Fat people not
only impose huge costs on society because they are tend to be
unhealthier than thin ones. They are also damned annoying when you
have to sit next to them on airliners.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing people to be thin may seem a little farfetched. But then
so did banning smoking in bars just a few years ago. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since the collapse of communism, America has been casting
around for a new enemy. Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic
gamely volunteered for the role. But no great nation can define
itself against such tinpot figures.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans want to demonize China. But American business
is not willing to kiss goodbye a billion potential customers.
</P>
<P>
   As for Pat Buchanan's idea of going the whole hog and demonizing
all foreigners, it is rapidly turning him from a merely marginal
figure into an irrelevance.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that these days Americans are keener on finding
their evil empires at home than abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign countries seldom impinge on people's attention, and when
they do it is more likely to be as a source of a nifty product than
as a military threat. But when it comes to giant companies that
make their living out of persuading people to consume noxious
substances, Americans are as vigilant as they were at the height of
the communist menace.
</P>
<P>
   With the release on Nov. 5 of Michael Mann's new film, ``The
Insider,'' big tobacco takes yet another step towards filling the
place once occupied by the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the story of how it tried to silence Jeffrey
Wigand, a scientist turned whistle-blower, blackening his
reputation and using a threat of a $15 billion lawsuit to make CBS
drop an interview with him.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood has been slow to join the anti-tobacco crusade,
perhaps remembering the golden days when Humphrey Bogart and Lauren
Bacall breathed clouds of cigarette smoke at each other. But this
film has Hollywood on the march.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson's silencing of Wigand proved to be a Pyrrhic
victory. The company's ruthless treatment of its former employee
was soon exposed in the press, and CBS, its tail between its legs,
finally screened its scoop. It was also one of big tobacco's last
victories in its long campaign to keep the media at bay.
</P>
<P>
   People who leave Mann's film thinking that tobacco companies are
still omnipotent organizations that can conceal evidence of the
effects of tobacco are as deceived as those CIA geniuses who
speculated that Yuri Andropov's Russia was pulling ahead of
America. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Big tobacco was already in headlong retreat by the time Wigand
made it to the screen. In ``Thank You for Smoking,'' Christopher
Buckley's 1994 satire of the tobacco wars (Random House), the
industry's public-relations machine is already a joke.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's chief ``smokesperson'' is about to lose his job
because of his failure to reverse the trend of public opinion. His
only comfort is his regular lunches with fellow self-described
``Merchants of Death'' from SAFETY (the Society for the Advancement
of Firearms and Effective Training of Youth) and the Moderation
Council (formerly the National Association for Alcoholic
Beverages).
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the defeat has become a rout. Smoking is banned in
most public buildings. In California you cannot smoke in bars; in
Davis and Palo Alto you cannot smoke within 20 feet of a public
building.
</P>
<P>
   The country is so plastered with anti-smoking ads, most of them
paid for by the tobacco industry as part of a $206 billion
settlement with the states, that Marlboro Man is becoming a symbol
of impotence and emphysema rather than rugged independence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mind if I smoke?'' asks an elegant young man on a popular
Californian billboard. ``Care if I die?'' replies his date. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES AT 1,075) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What the tobacco wars show is how feeble even the most ruthless
big businesses are compared with a newer force in American life:
the alliance of citizen activists, public-health officials and
trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The first shots in the tobacco wars were fired by citizen
activists. Ahron Leichtman founded Citizens for a Tobacco-Free
Society because the merest whiff of tobacco smoke gave him a
headache.
</P>
<P>
   John Banzhaf got so sick of advertisements featuring
``confident, rugged men smoking cigarettes'' that he founded Action
on Smoking and Health, ASH. (His motto, shown in abbreviated form
on his license plate is, ``Sue the bastards.'')
</P>
<P>
   These people became an unstoppable force when they linked up
with the medical and legal professions. The public-health
profession has been looking for a justification for its existence
ever since the communicable diseases that it was established to
fight were all but wiped out.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco provided just what it needed. And anti-tobacco lawsuits
are the legal profession's equivalent of Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   A Florida state court's decision last month, in a case involving
500,000 smokers, that the jury can award punitive damages in a
single lump sum instead of deciding cases one smoker at a time
means that another gigantic ruling against tobacco companies may be
in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a danger _ drop your voice _ that the anti-smoking
crusade has gone too far?
</P>
<P>
   Anti-smokers are undoubtedly right to say that big tobacco
failed to come clean about the harmful effects of smoking (though
why people should choose to listen to the industry's advertisements
rather than the surgeon-general's health warnings is not clear).
</P>
<P>
   No doubt people should be educated about the ill-effects of
smoking. But, as the number of smokers inexorably declines,
disapproval has turned into intolerance, persuasion into outright
bullying.
</P>
<P>
   For many anti-smokers it is inconceivable that rational people
can understand the risks of smoking and still continue with the
habit. They must be either the slaves of addiction or the dupes of
the tobacco industry's propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   This attitude not only encourages anti-smokers to tolerate
grossly regressive taxes and even grosser infringements of
individual liberty. It also leads them to bring legal cases that
make a mockery of individual responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason why this should stop with smoking. What about
drinking? Many boozers share smokers' subversive belief that
quality of life is more important than quantity.
</P>
<P>
   What about skiing or paragliding? Both activities not only
involve risks to their participants but also costs to the people
who have to clear up after their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the national epidemic of obesity? Fat people not
only impose huge costs on society because they are tend to be
unhealthier than thin ones. They are also damned annoying when you
have to sit next to them on airliners.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing people to be thin may seem a little farfetched. But then
so did banning smoking in bars just a few years ago. &QL;

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.

   KATIMA MULILO, MASERU AND SOWETO _ Most golfers merely seek
manicured fairways, velvet greens and a cool gin and tonic
afterwards in a softly-furnished clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Africa caters adequately for these timid types, but
where the region excels is in providing more intrepid golfers with
unusual challenges. Where else can you encounter lions in the deep
rough, or choke on sorghum beer at the club bar?
</P>
<P>
   If you are unlucky, golf in southern Africa can mean being
trampled by an elephant, scragged by umbrella thorns, or surprised
by naked muggers with leaves in their hair, as happened to two lady
golfers recently in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   But golf is sometimes a game that needs a bit of added spice.
For golfers of spirit, your correspondent recommends three
memorable African courses.
</P>
<P>
   The first, Katima Mulilo Golf Club, is in the Caprivi region of
Namibia and is, well, a bit remote: 12 hours' drive across arid
scrubland from Windhoek, the Namibian capital, to be precise _ and
that's if there are no roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the weather is perfect, the bulbuls twitter, and it is easy
to get a tee time because most tourists were scared off by the
recent uprising by Caprivian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Since August the town is no longer under curfew, so golfers who
play on after dusk are unlikely to be shot. But hippopotami from
the nearby Zambezi River sometimes wander on to the course at night
to nibble the bushes. Since these beasts are notoriously
ill-tempered, it is advisable to play only during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one flag at Katima Mulilo, so one player must
carry it around and place it in each hole in turn. The flag-carrier
has an advantage, for there are at least two holes in each green,
and he can pick the one closest to where his ball has landed.
</P>
<P>
   Putting is tricky, however, for the greens are bristly and
uneven, a bit like a hairbrush that has been chewed by a dog.
</P>
<P>
   For a chillier challenge, drive up into the mountains of
Lesotho, where an icy wind blows balls into bunkers and the locals
wear blankets all year round.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Maseru Golf Club is in the middle of the capital,
about a drive and a one-iron from the palace of King Letsie III.
But it is not easy to find. Visitors often drive around the course
once or twice looking for the clubhouse before stopping at a shack
to ask for directions, only to be told that the shack is, actually,
the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The green on the first hole is perfectly flat and stunningly
green. But a well-lofted approach shot lands with a splash and
disappears, for it is in fact a pond covered in algae. The real
green is the brown circle of dirt to the left.
</P>
<P>
   There are no flags at all at Royal Maseru _ they were all stolen
to make curtain rods in nearby squatter camps. So it is quite
difficult to know where to aim. But your three caddies
(unemployment is a big problem in Lesotho) all brim with helpful
tips on how to play each hole.
</P>
<P>
   The best of your correspondent's trio of African courses,
however, is the Soweto Country Club, on the edge of the black
township of that name outside Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   The course was built in 1972 by the local council in order to
substantiate the big apartheid lie that blacks did not need to be
admitted to white clubs (or schools or hospitals for that matter)
because they had their own. Since whites were not allowed to play
in Soweto, it became the height of radical chic to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was trouble, we'd smuggle them out along back
roads,'' says Michael Nompula, the club's burgundy-jacketed
60-year-old president.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, most whites do not go into Soweto because they are
terrified of getting carjacked. But the club's 450-strong
membership is still 20 percent white. Some join because it is
cheap; others want to learn how to socialize with blacks, an
essential skill in the new South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Owing to a lack of space, the fairways at Soweto are
frighteningly narrow. Thousands of trees punish wayward tee shots,
and young black professionals who learn their game at Soweto hit
wonderfully straight.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is still seen as a white game in South Africa: Soweto is
the only club in a black township, and blacks have yet to win more
than a handful of professional tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Aspiring black South African golfers have no local hero to
follow. Their role model is a foreigner: Tiger Woods, the young
black American who is the world's most highly-paid striker of a
ball.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is unlikely, as his father once claimed, to do more for
mankind than Jesus did, but he sure spreads hope around Soweto. &QL;

   KATIMA MULILO, MASERU AND SOWETO _ Most golfers merely seek
manicured fairways, velvet greens and a cool gin and tonic
afterwards in a softly-furnished clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Africa caters adequately for these timid types, but
where the region excels is in providing more intrepid golfers with
unusual challenges. Where else can you encounter lions in the deep
rough, or choke on sorghum beer at the club bar?
</P>
<P>
   If you are unlucky, golf in southern Africa can mean being
trampled by an elephant, scragged by umbrella thorns, or surprised
by naked muggers with leaves in their hair, as happened to two lady
golfers recently in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   But golf is sometimes a game that needs a bit of added spice.
For golfers of spirit, your correspondent recommends three
memorable African courses.
</P>
<P>
   The first, Katima Mulilo Golf Club, is in the Caprivi region of
Namibia and is, well, a bit remote: 12 hours' drive across arid
scrubland from Windhoek, the Namibian capital, to be precise _ and
that's if there are no roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   But the weather is perfect, the bulbuls twitter, and it is easy
to get a tee time because most tourists were scared off by the
recent uprising by Caprivian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Since August the town is no longer under curfew, so golfers who
play on after dusk are unlikely to be shot. But hippopotami from
the nearby Zambezi River sometimes wander on to the course at night
to nibble the bushes. Since these beasts are notoriously
ill-tempered, it is advisable to play only during daylight hours.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one flag at Katima Mulilo, so one player must
carry it around and place it in each hole in turn. The flag-carrier
has an advantage, for there are at least two holes in each green,
and he can pick the one closest to where his ball has landed.
</P>
<P>
   Putting is tricky, however, for the greens are bristly and
uneven, a bit like a hairbrush that has been chewed by a dog.
</P>
<P>
   For a chillier challenge, drive up into the mountains of
Lesotho, where an icy wind blows balls into bunkers and the locals
wear blankets all year round.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Maseru Golf Club is in the middle of the capital,
about a drive and a one-iron from the palace of King Letsie III.
But it is not easy to find. Visitors often drive around the course
once or twice looking for the clubhouse before stopping at a shack
to ask for directions, only to be told that the shack is, actually,
the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The green on the first hole is perfectly flat and stunningly
green. But a well-lofted approach shot lands with a splash and
disappears, for it is in fact a pond covered in algae. The real
green is the brown circle of dirt to the left.
</P>
<P>
   There are no flags at all at Royal Maseru _ they were all stolen
to make curtain rods in nearby squatter camps. So it is quite
difficult to know where to aim. But your three caddies
(unemployment is a big problem in Lesotho) all brim with helpful
tips on how to play each hole.
</P>
<P>
   The best of your correspondent's trio of African courses,
however, is the Soweto Country Club, on the edge of the black
township of that name outside Johannesburg.
</P>

admitted to white clubs (or schools or hospitals for that matter)
because they had their own. Since whites were not allowed to play
in Soweto, it became the height of radical chic to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was trouble, we'd smuggle them out along back
roads,'' says Michael Nompula, the club's burgundy-jacketed
60-year-old president.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, most whites do not go into Soweto because they are
terrified of getting carjacked. But the club's 450-strong
membership is still 20 percent white. Some join because it is
cheap; others want to learn how to socialize with blacks, an
essential skill in the new South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Owing to a lack of space, the fairways at Soweto are
frighteningly narrow. Thousands of trees punish wayward tee shots,
and young black professionals who learn their game at Soweto hit
wonderfully straight.
</P>
<P>
   Golf is still seen as a white game in South Africa: Soweto is
the only club in a black township, and blacks have yet to win more

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-EARLIEST-AMERICANS (Santa Fe, N.M.) _ A growing body of
intriguing evidence is telling a much new story of the peopling of
the Americas. From Alaska to Brazil and southern Chile, artifacts
and skeletons are forcing archaeologists to abandon Bering Straits
migration theory and come to terms with a more complex picture of
earliest American settlement. People may have arrived thousands to
tens of thousands of years sooner, in many waves of migration and
by a number of routes. Their ancestry may not have been only Asian.
Some of the migrations may have originated in Australia or Europe.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-INDIANS-SKELETON (Undated) _ Not all the conflicts in the
search for the earliest Americans center on rival scientists with
sharply different interpretations of the bones and artifacts they
are finding. Emboldened by a 1990 federal law, American Indians
have joined the fight with forceful claims that it is, after all,
their past that all the fuss is over. The uneasy relationship
between archaeologists and the people they study has erupted into a
bitter court battle over the skeleton of a muscular, middle-aged
man who dies sometime between 8,000 and 9,300 years ago. By John
Noble Wilford. (1000 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HOSPITAL-INFECTION (Undated) _ According to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention, 5 percent of the people admitted to
hospitals, about 1.8 million patients a year, will pick up an
infection there. The infections cost $4.5 billion to treat, the
C.D.C. estimates, and it says better infection control could have
prevented one-third of those cases. And the cause is simple:
doctors and nurses often don't wash their hands between patients.
By Emily Yoffe. (1750 words)
</P>
<P>
   With photo.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OCEAN-CLIMATE (Undated) _ Scientists now believe they may
have identified a comparable kind of weather pattern involving deep
ocean currents. They say a perpetual oscillation of ocean
temperatures could warm and cool substantial parts of the globe on
longer time scales of centuries to millenniums. By William K.
Stevens. (940 words)

   SCI-SMALL-SATELLITES (Washington) _ NASA will be testing a new
concept in tiny satellites. Some, weighing less than a pound and
hardly larger than a pack of playing cards, could be used alone to
perform simple tasks or flown in formations to execute more complex
ones. By Warren E. Leary. (1300 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-FISH-CONSERVE (Undated) _ As overfishing depletes the seas
of prized species like cod, tuna and swordfish, conservation groups
are urging consumers to make dining choices they say will help
damaged ecosystems recover and support sustainable fisheries. Their
lists recommend seafoods to eat and avoid. ``It's an environmental
problem whose solution is in your hands every time you buy
seafood,'' says the Monterey Bay Aquarium's seafood guide, which
made its debut last month. By William J. Broad. (1200 words)

   The celluloid world, like the natural world, changes with the
seasons. Thus summer tends to belong to adolescent boys and their
blockbusters; Christmas belongs to the family and feel-good films.
But autumn, season of mists and mellow fruitfulness, belongs
(appropriately) to the adult.
</P>
<P>
   This autumn is no exception, with a slate of films whose theme
is nothing less than masculinity in all its permutations: ladies'
men and manly men; warrior men and wimpy men; fully-realized men
and two-dimensional men.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't exactly original, but what's interesting about the
current crop of heroes and antiheroes is that they're addressing,
to varying degrees, the question of what it means to be a man.
</P>
<P>
   Even the newest James Bond film, ``The World is Not Enough''
(which features a shaven-headed baddie with a lust for the world's
oil and a bullet in his brain that renders him impervious to pain)
is touting a more vulnerable, self-conscious aspect to the
able-bodied spy.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, you know you've hit a trend.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set early on by two films from different ends of
the Hollywood spectrum: the high-minded ``American Beauty'' and the
low-hitting ``Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Though aesthetically opposite _ the first is dreamily beautiful,
the second all hyperkinetic jump cuts _ they are at base
surprisingly similar variations on the theme that Susan Faludi
expounds in her book, ``Stiffed: the Betrayal of the American
Man'': man, at least the American edition of him, is having a
masculinity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In ``American Beauty,'' the man is Kevin Spacey, henpecked
mediocrity trapped inside a well-decorated but deeply disturbed
suburbia, ignored by his wife, unfulfilled by his job, and
fantasizing about his daughter's friend.
</P>
<P>
   All this changes when a dope-dealing teenager moves in next
door. The lad's ability to see poetry in the mundane allows Spacey
to rediscover his manliness: he quits his job, starts
weight-lifting, gets a cool car, tells off his wife, and otherwise
finds happiness. Needless to say, it all ends badly.
</P>
<P>
   The man-smothering effects of home decor are at the forefront of
``Fight Club,'' a movie in which Edward Norton plays a
car-insurance executive caught inside an Ikea-style hell, wondering
what his dining room set says about him.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until he meets a subversive, dropout weirdo played by
Brad Pitt, the id to Norton's ego and a guy who makes soap out of
human fat stolen from a liposuction clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Together the two start Fight Club, a bare-knuckles beat-'em-up
event that quickly turns into a nationwide movement.
</P>
<P>
   Mission: to get in touch with your inner barbarian and wreak
havoc on yuppie coffee bars and credit-card companies.
</P>
<P>
   Message: that mail-order catalogues can only conceal the true
nature of man, and that everything is so much easier when it is in
black and white (or, indeed, in black and blue).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the film's logic is less than convincing, relying
as it does on the theory that this generation's curse was being
raised by their mothers: ergo they are wimpy and feminine, and ergo
they can only know what it means to be a man when they're bashing
each other's heads in. (Weren't cavemen raised by their mothers
when their fathers were out foraging for food?)
</P>
<P>
   Film may be fiction, but the metaphor is most effective when
rooted in some sort of reality, as it is in director Jim Jarmusch's
``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ghost Dog of the title is Forest Whittaker, a black man who
is saved from a racial beating by a mid-ranking mafia hood, and who
then pledges himself to his savior.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the rubble of this world, a place that he finds
increasingly confusing, Ghost Dog takes refuge in the rules of a
world that never waver: that of the samurai.
</P>
<P>
   Though he spends most of the film as an assassin, it never gives
him a qualm; his warrior code acts as his moral compass.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off, as Jarmusch presents it, is a shortened lifespan
in return for lack of inner turmoil. In other words, if you want an
absolute answer as to what ``manhood'' means, you have to be ready
to die for it. Or at least to lose your job.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the issue at the heart of ``The Insider.'' a
dramatization of the notorious episode a few years ago when the
television news program ``60 Minutes'' and its anchorman Mike
Wallace were pushed by the tobacco companies into dumping an item
on an industry whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   Here, moral certainty makes the man, as it does in a number of
other films, including ``Bringing Out The Dead,'' Martin Scorsese's
story about an ambulance driver's self-destruction, and ``The Green
Mile,'' the long-awaited adaptation of Stephen King's novella about
guilt and repentance.
</P>
<P>
   In these films, masculinity is intrinsically linked to facing
down the devil within, an altogether more complicated process, both
to dramatize and to watch, than facing down the devil without.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is the classic Hollywood model of maleness, and at
the moment it's almost a genre in itself: aside from the Bond film,
there's Johnny Depp investigating evil in ``Sleepy Hollow''; Arnold
Schwarzenegger saving the world from the devil in ``End of Days'';
and ``The Omega Code,'' a PG-rated ``Christian'' thriller about the
apocalypse where good, in the person of the square-jawed hero, wins
the day.
</P>
<P>
   That film has already proved a big money-spinner, suggesting
that audiences like such messages about gender identity: wham, bam,
that's a man.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most absorbing, nuanced, and challenging portrait of
masculinity on-screen this autumn would have to be that of ``Boys
Don't Cry,'' a film based on a true story about a teenage girl in
the American Midwest named Teena Brandon who, as Brandon Teena,
bound her breasts, cut her hair, and otherwise took on the
trappings of a stereotypical guy.
</P>
<P>
   After falling in with a group of rednecks and falling in love
with their ``princess,'' she was ultimately killed for her
transgression. But before the denouement you can see that Brandon,
unlike the other male characters on screen, loves being a boy, and
not only that: she's very good at it.
</P>
<P>
   Her face glows when examining her black eye, throwing back a
shot of Jack Daniel's, or otherwise acting ``male''; she is both
physically and emotionally braver than the guys she hangs out with.
For Brandon, being a man is _ more than muscles or mayhem _ a state
of mind. &QL;

   This autumn is no exception, with a slate of films whose theme
is nothing less than masculinity in all its permutations: ladies'
men and manly men; warrior men and wimpy men; fully-realized men
and two-dimensional men.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't exactly original, but what's interesting about the
current crop of heroes and antiheroes is that they're addressing,
to varying degrees, the question of what it means to be a man.
</P>
<P>
   Even the newest James Bond film, ``The World is Not Enough''
(which features a shaven-headed baddie with a lust for the world's
oil and a bullet in his brain that renders him impervious to pain)
is touting a more vulnerable, self-conscious aspect to the
able-bodied spy.
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, you know you've hit a trend.
</P>
<P>
   The tone was set early on by two films from different ends of
the Hollywood spectrum: the high-minded ``American Beauty'' and the
low-hitting ``Fight Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Though aesthetically opposite _ the first is dreamily beautiful,
the second all hyperkinetic jump cuts _ they are at base
surprisingly similar variations on the theme that Susan Faludi
expounds in her book, ``Stiffed: the Betrayal of the American
Man'': man, at least the American edition of him, is having a
masculinity crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In ``American Beauty,'' the man is Kevin Spacey, henpecked
mediocrity trapped inside a well-decorated but deeply disturbed
suburbia, ignored by his wife, unfulfilled by his job, and
fantasizing about his daughter's friend.
</P>
<P>
   All this changes when a dope-dealing teenager moves in next
door. The lad's ability to see poetry in the mundane allows Spacey
to rediscover his manliness: he quits his job, starts
weight-lifting, gets a cool car, tells off his wife, and otherwise
finds happiness. Needless to say, it all ends badly.
</P>
<P>
   The man-smothering effects of home decor are at the forefront of
``Fight Club,'' a movie in which Edward Norton plays a
car-insurance executive caught inside an Ikea-style hell, wondering
what his dining room set says about him.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until he meets a subversive, dropout weirdo played by
Brad Pitt, the id to Norton's ego and a guy who makes soap out of
human fat stolen from a liposuction clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Together the two start Fight Club, a bare-knuckles beat-'em-up
event that quickly turns into a nationwide movement.
</P>
<P>
   Mission: to get in touch with your inner barbarian and wreak
havoc on yuppie coffee bars and credit-card companies.
</P>
<P>
   Message: that mail-order catalogues can only conceal the true
nature of man, and that everything is so much easier when it is in
black and white (or, indeed, in black and blue).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the film's logic is less than convincing, relying
as it does on the theory that this generation's curse was being
raised by their mothers: ergo they are wimpy and feminine, and ergo
they can only know what it means to be a man when they're bashing
each other's heads in. (Weren't cavemen raised by their mothers
when their fathers were out foraging for food?)
</P>
<P>
   Film may be fiction, but the metaphor is most effective when
rooted in some sort of reality, as it is in director Jim Jarmusch's
``Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ghost Dog of the title is Forest Whittaker, a black man who
is saved from a racial beating by a mid-ranking mafia hood, and who
then pledges himself to his savior.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the rubble of this world, a place that he finds
increasingly confusing, Ghost Dog takes refuge in the rules of a
world that never waver: that of the samurai.
</P>
<P>
   Though he spends most of the film as an assassin, it never gives
him a qualm; his warrior code acts as his moral compass.
</P>
<P>
   The trade-off, as Jarmusch presents it, is a shortened lifespan
in return for lack of inner turmoil. In other words, if you want an
absolute answer as to what ``manhood'' means, you have to be ready
to die for it. Or at least to lose your job.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the issue at the heart of ``The Insider.'' a
dramatization of the notorious episode a few years ago when the
television news program ``60 Minutes'' and its anchorman Mike
Wallace were pushed by the tobacco companies into dumping an item
on an industry whistle-blower.
</P>
<P>
   Here, moral certainty makes the man, as it does in a number of
other films, including ``Bringing Out The Dead,'' Martin Scorsese's
story about an ambulance driver's self-destruction, and ``The Green
Mile,'' the long-awaited adaptation of Stephen King's novella about
guilt and repentance.
</P>
<P>
   In these films, masculinity is intrinsically linked to facing
down the devil within, an altogether more complicated process, both
to dramatize and to watch, than facing down the devil without.
</P>
<P>
   The latter is the classic Hollywood model of maleness, and at
the moment it's almost a genre in itself: aside from the Bond film,
there's Johnny Depp investigating evil in ``Sleepy Hollow''; Arnold
Schwarzenegger saving the world from the devil in ``End of Days'';
and ``The Omega Code,'' a PG-rated ``Christian'' thriller about the
apocalypse where good, in the person of the square-jawed hero, wins
the day.
</P>
<P>
   That film has already proved a big money-spinner, suggesting
that audiences like such messages about gender identity: wham, bam,
that's a man.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the most absorbing, nuanced, and challenging portrait of
masculinity on-screen this autumn would have to be that of ``Boys
Don't Cry,'' a film based on a true story about a teenage girl in
the American Midwest named Teena Brandon who, as Brandon Teena,
bound her breasts, cut her hair, and otherwise took on the
trappings of a stereotypical guy.
</P>
<P>
   After falling in with a group of rednecks and falling in love
with their ``princess,'' she was ultimately killed for her
transgression. But before the denouement you can see that Brandon,
unlike the other male characters on screen, loves being a boy, and
not only that: she's very good at it.
</P>
<P>
   Her face glows when examining her black eye, throwing back a
shot of Jack Daniel's, or otherwise acting ``male''; she is both
physically and emotionally braver than the guys she hangs out with.
For Brandon, being a man is _ more than muscles or mayhem _ a state
of mind. &QL;

 &HT;    MOST FIRST BABIES NOW CONCEIVED OUT OF WEDLOCK
 &HT;    By RAVEN HILL
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the early 1990s most young women in the United
States conceived their first child out of wedlock, a rate that has
nearly tripled since the 1930s, the Census Bureau reported
Tuesday.(cq)
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of first births conceived out of wedlock among
women aged 15 to 29 grew from 18 percent in the period between
1930-1934 to 53 percent between 1990-1994, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend was similar for first babies born out of wedlock,
which grew from 8 percent in the early 1930s to 41 percent in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the rapid growth is that having children outside
of marriage is more socially acceptable today than in the 1930s,
said Amara Bachu, a Census Bureau analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not looked down on by society, parents, schools or the
federal government, which may be why more women choose to have
children before marriage,'' Bachu said.
</P>
<P>
   Bachu said she also found that more women are postponing
marriage in order to pursue career goals or attain higher
education, leading to more premarital births. The growing number of
live-in relationships and the healthy economy factor into the
growing number as well, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that four factors tend to determine a
woman's chances of marrying after she gets pregnant _ age, race,
education level and geographic location. Teenaged women, black
women, women with less than a high school education, and women who
live in the Midwest were less likely to marry in the event of
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Bachu said researchers were unsure why women from the Midwest
were less likely to marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Midwest tends to be more conservative. They may have fewer
live-in relationships,'' which were increasingly found to result in
children, Bachu said.
</P>
<P>
   The study reported that 89 percent of births to teenagers
occurred before marriage in the 1990s, compared to less than 30
percent 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>

   For black women, the percentage of first births either born or

1930s to 86 percent in the 1990s. Rates of marriage before first

 &HT;    MOST FIRST BABIES NOW CONCEIVED OUT OF WEDLOCK
 &HT;    Eds: Repeating to note that this story is embargoed by source

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the early 1990s most young women in the United
States conceived their first child out of wedlock, a rate that has
nearly tripled since the 1930s, the Census Bureau reported
Tuesday.(cq)
</P>
<P>
   The proportion of first births conceived out of wedlock among
women aged 15 to 29 grew from 18 percent in the period between
1930-1934 to 53 percent between 1990-1994, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The trend was similar for first babies born out of wedlock,
which grew from 8 percent in the early 1930s to 41 percent in the
early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the rapid growth is that having children outside
of marriage is more socially acceptable today than in the 1930s,
said Amara Bachu, a Census Bureau analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not looked down on by society, parents, schools or the
federal government, which may be why more women choose to have
children before marriage,'' Bachu said.
</P>
<P>
   Bachu said she also found that more women are postponing
marriage in order to pursue career goals or attain higher
education, leading to more premarital births. The growing number of
live-in relationships and the healthy economy factor into the
growing number as well, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that four factors tend to determine a
woman's chances of marrying after she gets pregnant _ age, race,
education level and geographic location. Teenaged women, black
women, women with less than a high school education, and women who
live in the Midwest were less likely to marry in the event of
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Bachu said researchers were unsure why women from the Midwest
were less likely to marry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Midwest tends to be more conservative. They may have fewer
live-in relationships,'' which were increasingly found to result in
children, Bachu said.
</P>
<P>
   The study reported that 89 percent of births to teenagers
occurred before marriage in the 1990s, compared to less than 30
percent 60 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents of teenagers tend to encourage them to pursue an
education,'' Bachu said. ``They take care of their grandkids.''
</P>
<P>
   For black women, the percentage of first births either born or
conceived before first marriage doubled from 43 percent in the
1930s to 86 percent in the 1990s. Rates of marriage before first
births among black women declined.
</P>
<P>
   The study suggested that not only are women less likely to marry
when premaritally pregnant, they are also less likely to marry even
after the birth of their child.
</P>
<P>
   Bachu said a fear of a failed marriage could account for many
women's hesitation to marry after they become pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be looking at it from a wider standpoint,'' she said.
``Why get involved in a marriage that could end in divorce,
domestic violence or child abuse?''

   SCI-EARLIEST-AMERICANS (Santa Fe, N.M.) _ A growing body of
intriguing evidence is telling a much new story of the peopling of
the Americas. From Alaska to Brazil and southern Chile, artifacts
and skeletons are forcing archaeologists to abandon Bering Straits
migration theory and come to terms with a more complex picture of
earliest American settlement. People may have arrived thousands to
tens of thousands of years sooner, in many waves of migration and
by a number of routes. Their ancestry may not have been only Asian.
Some of the migrations may have originated in Australia or Europe.

   SCI-INDIANS-SKELETON (Undated) _ Not all the conflicts in the
search for the earliest Americans center on rival scientists with
sharply different interpretations of the bones and artifacts they
are finding. Emboldened by a 1990 federal law, American Indians
have joined the fight with forceful claims that it is, after all,
their past that all the fuss is over. The uneasy relationship
between archaeologists and the people they study has erupted into a
bitter court battle over the skeleton of a muscular, middle-aged
man who dies sometime between 8,000 and 9,300 years ago. By John

C.D.C. estimates, and it says better infection control could have
prevented one-third of those cases. And the cause is simple:
doctors and nurses often don't wash their hands between patients.

sound advice in general, it can often result in needless discomfort

   WASHINGTON _ Entrepreneurs who have made fortunes from the
online revolution have an obligation to give away large chunks of
their wealth to ensure that ``in the Internet century, no children
get left behind,'' Steve Case, chairman of America Online Inc.,
said Monday while announcing a public-private partnership to help
poorer children get online.
</P>
<P>
   Putting his own money where his mouth was, Case said his
family's charitable foundation will give $10 million to help
establish the PowerUP partnership, which will coordinate private
donors and businesses with nonprofit organizations and federal
agencies to give underserved children access to computers and
guidance on how to use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Case Foundation is paying for the initial staff
administrative costs. The Waitt Family Foundation, established by
Gateway Inc. chairman Ted Waitt, will supply 50,000 computers to
community centers. America Online then will give away 100,000
accounts for Internet access. More than 400 specially trained,
full-time AmeriCorpsVISTA workers will provide an adult presence at
PowerUP-supported centers.
</P>
<P>
   The computer centers will be closely tied to local YMCAs, Boys &AMP;
Girls Clubs, Save the Children, National Urban League and other
organizations with connections to young people. The AmeriCorpsVISTA
workers will coordinate with local schools to make sure PowerUp
efforts complement educational programs. Students will be able to
access only Web sites that have been screened for appropriate
content.
</P>
<P>
   Case said that, because so many new jobs will be tied to the
Internet in coming years, all children need knowledge of computers.
``Just as the nation made a successful commitment to ensuring that
every child has access to public education starting at the age of
five, we must now commit ourselves to ensuring that in the 21st
century every child in America has access to technology so that no
one falls behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Waitt agreed, saying that because the Internet ``has created an
era of almost unprecedented prosperity,'' the affluent must ``share
so that everybody can take part.''
</P>
<P>
   Retired Army Gen. Colin Powell, who serves on the PowerUP board,
said people all over the world are looking at the United States to
see whether its form of capitalism is worthy of support and
imitation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communism is gone ... and we are in a remarkably powerful
position,'' Powell said. But that position will be eroded if others
see that capitalism distributes wealth only to a handful of people,
while leaving the poor behind, he said. ``We can't be that shining
city on a hill,'' he said, unless the light reaches all children.

IN-HOUSE WORD MAVEN SURVEYS NEW USAGE MANUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Nov. 14)  
(Eds: Items in bold should be set in italics.) 
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Nov. 1, the president of the United States lost his capital.
</P>
<P>
   This is not about the burning of the Executive Mansion by the
British on Aug. 24, 1814, just after James Madison took flight from
the nation's capital and his wife, Dolley, cut the Gilbert Stuart
portrait of George Washington out of its frame and took it with her
for safekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, I refer to the recent Triumph of the Lowercase (or, as
we are now encouraged to put it, the triumph of the lowercase). In
the latest, eagerly awaited New York Times Manual of Style and
Usage _ subtitled (curiously, all in initial caps) ``The Official
Style Guide Used by the Writers and Editors of the World's Most
Authoritative Newspaper'' _ the capital letter is decisively taken
down.
</P>
<P>
   We are guided: ``It is  &UR; President Lamm &LR;  (without a given name)
in a first reference to the current president of the United
States.'' Note: not ``the current President,'' with a capital  &UR; P &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   From now on, even when referring to the specific person holding
the highest office in the nation, Times style is to lowercase the
 &UR; p &LR; . The Associated Press stylebook has been doing this for decades
(which is why I sometimes refer to the a.p.), but I like the
respect shown to the particular president marked by the capital
 &UR; P &LR; . My preferred style, no longer stylish: ```This is an attempt
to bumfuzzle,' said the President.''
</P>
<P>
   The same lowercasing is in store for  &UR; founding fathers &LR;  (an
expression coined by Warren G. Harding, the 29th president). The
Times further suggests desexing the alliterative phrase to
 &UR; founders &LR; , though I can't think of any who were mothers.
Inconsistently, The Times holds fast to the capitalization of
 &UR; Fourth Estate &LR; ; that's got to go.
</P>
<P>
   So it's ``God save the king,'' not ``the King.'' Speaking of
God, the faithful will be happy to see that the Supreme Being
retains his capital. But note that I just wrote ``his capital''_
lowercase  &UR; h &LR; , not ``His capital'' or, as some would insist, ``Her
capital.'' The New York Times stylebook entry: ``God (Supreme
Being). Lowercase  &UR; he &LR; , &UR; him &LR; , &UR; his &LR; ,  &UR; thee &LR; ,  &UR; thou &LR; ,  &UR; who &LR;  and
 &UR; whom &LR;  when the reference is to God, Jesus, the Holy Ghost (or the
Holy Spirit) or Allah.''
</P>
<P>
   I go along with this judgment, though I may pay for it on
judgment day, because of a parenthetical remark in a letter written
in the last century by Herman Melville to his literary mentor,
Nathaniel Hawthorne: ``You perceive I employ a capital initial in
the pronoun referring to the Deity; don't you think there is a
slight dash of flunkeyism in that usage?''
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the times can be seen in the entries dropped and added
between editions of the stylebook. Gone are  &UR; Molotov cocktail &LR; ,
 &UR; women's liberation &LR; ,  &UR; monkey wrench &LR; ,  &UR; Novocain &LR;  and  &UR; zymurgy &LR;  (a
word for fermentation that hasn't been used or abused in decades).
In are  &UR; voice mail &LR; ,  &UR; postmodern &LR; ,  &UR; euro &LR;  (that unified currency is
lowercased, though  &UR; Eurocurrency &LR;  is not, to differentiate U.S.
dollars held in European banks),  &UR; feng shui &LR;  and  &UR; into the breach &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   About that last: Apparently, too many reporters have been using
that phrase instead of Shakespeare's ``Once more  &UR; unto &LR;  the
breach.'' And the Bard's usage is also neatly defended in the entry
for  &UR; gild the lily &LR; : ``An accepted phrase for overembellishment,
but writers who wish to delight the exacting reader will use
Shakespeare's actual words, from `King John': `To gild refined
gold, to  &UR; paint the lily &LR; .'''
</P>
<P>
   I think Allan M. Siegal and William G. Connolly, authors of the
new stylebook, had this column in mind on  &UR; gilding the lily &LR; ,
because an exacting readership is what I've got.
</P>
<P>
   In jocular jousting with the arbiters of style in New York, I
win a few and lose a few.  &UR; Speechwriter &LR;  is now a solid word, and
 &UR; catalog &LR;  no longer ends in  &UR; ue &LR; .  &UR; Data &LR;  is now accepted as
singular, and I'm thinking of starting a fight about  &UR; media &LR; , which
should be as singular as  &UR; fourth estate &LR; . (If the copy editor has
capitalized that, I've been sabotaged.)
</P>
<P>
   The first entry I turned to was  &UR; American Indian &LR; . For years, I
have been insisting that I am a  &UR; native American &LR; , having been born
in the United States, and resisting the seizure of that compound by
aboriginal Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Times says that ``American Indian(s) remains the most widely
used term for the native people of North America'' and notes that
 &UR; Native Americans &LR;  is rejected by some Indians because the U.S.
government uses the term to include Eskimos, Aleuts, Native
Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders. The book's solution: Use the term
preferred by the people written about.
</P>
<P>
   Fights I have lost so far:  &UR; Ms &LR; ., though not an abbreviation,
takes a period. Nicknames, at least those for bad guys, are still
in parentheses, not quotation marks, and so I cannot refer to
Willie ``the actor'' Sutton's nocturnal pioneering in automatic
teller machine withdrawals.  &UR; Pee &LR;  is still disallowed (show me a
little kid who asks to urinate), and  &UR; versus &LR;  is still preferred to
 &UR; vs. &LR; , though  &UR; v. &LR;  is OK for court cases. Even though my word
processor defaults to  &UR; stories &LR; , that word is frowned upon except
at bedtime: ``The preferred word for a newspaper or magazine report
is  &UR; article &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Siegal and Connolly grimly insist on putting an apostrophe in
decades: We're coming to the end of the  &UR; 90's &LR; . They have a reason:
Many publications omit such apostrophes, but they are needed to
make The Times' all-cap headlines intelligible and are therefore
used throughout the paper for consistency. That means that you,
dear reader, are free to drop that apostrophe if you don't use all
caps in your headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Style is not a set of rules; it is a group of conventions to
reflect an attitude and set a tone. ``In approaching the mechanics
of usage and grammar,'' write Siegal and Connolly, ``this manual
reflects The Times's impression of its educated and sophisticated
readership _ traditional but not tradition-bound. ... Throughout,
the goal is a fluid style, easygoing but not slangy and only
occasionally colloquial.''
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about this institution's language arbiters is
their sense of place _ neither on the ramparts nor on the cutting
edge. For that reason, I would cheerfully plunk down $30 for the
new york times manual of style and usage, though I would capitalize
a few of those words and put an apostrophe after the  &UR; Times &LR; .

 CAPE MEXICO-LADN  
Mexico's East Cape beauty  
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Eds: Fact box, captions at bottom.) By Brett Pauly 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENAVISTA, Mexico _ So you've been to Southern Baja California,
but the fizzle has largely gone out of the champagne that is Cabo
San Lucas.
</P>
<P>
   You want something more authentic than the zoo of megahotels,
nightclubs and Americanized eateries that some feel has so diluted
the Mexican experience that Cabo could be Downtown Any City, U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Baja's East Cape _ smack dab in the middle of the
130-mile stretch between Cabo San Lucas and La Paz _ where the
uniquely quiet, relaxed and, some night owls might say, even boring
atmosphere is evidenced by the fact that the area's sole
discotheque was converted into a church and the only zoo is the
type with lions and tigers and bears ... oh, my.
</P>
<P>
   So often there are two sides to Mexican resorts. There's the
glitz and glamour, and then there's the reality that this is a
Third World country. With poor communities, livestock and litter
abutting the few hotels that break up this isolated region, the
East Cape leans dramatically toward the latter while still
providing wonderfully quaint and clean accommodations, classic
Mexican meals that come with the price of the room and more than
enough to see and do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as more laid back than a party town. It has a
definite taste of genuine Mexico,'' said Aaron Coxey of Bend, Ore.
``You can kick back, enjoy the sun, avoid the crowds and, when you
come back home, you feel like you've actually gone somewhere.
Whereas Cabo is like an American city.''
</P>
<P>
   The East Cape is the perfect alternative for those whose idea of
a Mexican vacation includes noiseless beaches, stylish pools that
are deserted at noon and bars that close each evening at 10.
</P>
<P>
   This lonely, arid outpost that is the southeast terminus of the
Baja peninsula splits the Pacific Ocean and the Sea of Cortez, or
Gulf of California. Its azure waters offer an amazing array of fish
_ 850 species _ and a seemingly endless supply. What can't be
reeled in (largely billfish, tuna and dorado) can be viewed
snorkeling and scuba diving. Indeed, like so many coastal
destinations in Baja California Sur, the East Cape is a
world-renowned magnet to saltwater anglers.
</P>
<P>
   But herein lies the beauty for those who don't fish or are less
committed: When the angling crowd is on the brine from 7 a.m. to 2
p.m., you've got the entire region, along with its rich amenities
and adventures that are often overlooked, all to yourselves.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Bird-watching, horseback riding, hiking, kayaking,
riding personal watercraft, windsurfing, touring botanical gardens,
viewing cave paintings, absorbing slices of life on every corner _
from kids' birthday parties to dining on goat served in a private
home _ and speeding on all-terrain vehicles to lagoons and springs
one would hardly expect to find in the desert. Families and seniors
who care less about the night life should feel especially
comfortable here.
</P>
<P>
   The journey by air begins in San Jose del Cabo. Travel
itineraries list the destination as Los Cabos, referring to the
general area between San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas 25 miles
to the southwest. Alaska Airlines operates a 9-month-old terminal
that is an inviting alternative to the often-raucous and unkempt
building that is home to several Mexican carriers.
</P>
<P>
   After clearing customs _ bring a passport; a driver's license or
birth certificate complicates entry _ a driver with the name of the
hotel you'll be staying at will be on hand for those who have
transfer vouchers (which can be arranged when booking a room).
Otherwise, taxis in Baja are as common as the cattle that are your
constant companions in this open-range territory.
</P>
<P>
   Cows, goats, horses and burros line the road north toward Los
Barriles, the ``hub'' of the East Cape _ such as it is _ that is
situated on Bahia de Palmas, just north of the Tropic of Cancer.
The tranquil bay is home to seven resorts along less than 25 miles
of shoreline from Punta Colorada north to Punta Pescadero.
</P>
<P>
   During the 45-minute ride north on Highway 1 to my
accommodations at Hotel Buenavista Beach Resort, my driver, Mario
Cano Alvarez of San Jose del Cabo, explained to me in a broken
conversation that the numerous crosses and (ital)criptas(end ital)
erected on the roadside are memorials to those whose paths were
fatefully interrupted by livestock.
</P>
<P>
   A dusty road not well marked leads the way to the hotel, which
has earned a two-diamond rating from the Automobile Club of
Southern California and four stars from the Mexican government.
Room rates run from $75 (U.S.) for a standard single to $200 for a
premium triple, and include all meals a la the ``American plan.''
The price for children ages 11 and younger is $15. Tax is an
additional 12 percent and gratuity _ paid up front as a convenience
to both parties so that most hotel expenses are accounted for early
on _ is another 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tile pathways accented with fountains, bougainvillea and lazily
swaying palms direct visitors to 60 cozy rooms and their welcoming
blasts of air conditioning. A centrally located pool is highlighted
by what's billed as the region's only swim-up bar.
</P>
<P>
   Locals often refer to the facility as ``Spa,'' after its
original name of Club Spa Buenavista. Hot springs flow through the
tropical landscape; until a water-cooling system with greater
capacity was installed more recently, visitors couldn't take cold
showers. The family-operated business was opened with 12 rooms in
1976 by owner Felipe Jesus ``Chuy'' Valdez Vasques.
</P>
<P>
   The original buildings were erected in the 1940s as a residence
and servants' quarters for then-territorial governor Agustin
Olachea, according to the newly released historical account, Gene
S. Kira's ``The Unforgettable Sea of Cortez'' (Cortez Publications;
$39.95).
</P>
<P>
   The menu is changed for each meal at the hotel's restaurant,
known for awesome breakfasts (French toast, beans, sausage, bacon,
Mexican-style eggs, coffee and orange juice) and adequate lunches
and dinners.
</P>
<P>
   For a taste of the surroundings, venture just up the road to
Loncheria Tia Licha, where a shredded beef or pork torta sells for
17 pesos _ or about $1.80 with the exchange rate of 9{ pesos to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A $10 round-trip taxi ride into Los Barriles is worthwhile. Such
touristy enterprises as East Cape Tackle &AMP; Art, Baja Beach Company
and Buzzard's Bay Sports Cantina are found in Plaza del Pueblo.
Taqueria La Palma on a nearby backstreet has tempting (ital)tacos
de pescado(end ital) for 6 pesos. For a most memorable meal, ask
around for the ``Goat Farm,'' where a local lady prepares goat in
her kitchen for a moderate price of about $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks it's just the hottest deal,'' said area
fly-fishing guide Gary Graham. Dying for American-style fare? Try
the more upscale Tio Pablo's Grill, Mananas Grill or Otra Vez
Restaurant &AMP; Cantina. But, by all means, stroll the friendly
streets of Los Barriles and enjoy the culture that is Mexico.
Remember that many operations _ hotels excluded _ shut down from 2
to 4 p.m. for siesta time.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from being infused with money from tourists and _ as one
local put it _ ``gringos building houses,'' the region is largely
agricultural, with mangos, basil, tomatoes and chiles primary
crops. Then there's the beer, lots and lots of (ital)cerveza.(end
ital) You frequently can't go a city block without running into one
distributor or another.
</P>
<P>
   For the less obvious adventure, inquire back at the hotel.
Nearly any odyssey available can be personalized _ for a price _
and appropriately attentive hotel personnel will ask several times
a day if they can arrange just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``For people who think this is an entertainment capital, it's
not,'' said Steve Chism, concessionaire of fishing tackle rentals
at Hotel Buenavista Beach Resort. ``But there are so many things to
do that people don't know about.''
</P>
<P>
   Chism charges $90 for an all-day bird-watching tour via ATV.
Coastal lagoons with brackish waters attract egrets, snowy plovers,
ospreys, peregrine falcons and an assortment of shorebirds. The
same rate is applied for guided trips up an (ital)arroyo(end ital)
bottom to a mango-, guava- and palm-punctuated spring _ or
(ital)chorro(end ital) or (ital)ojo de agua.(end ital) Chism
identifies plant life _ including a boggling variety of cactuses _
en route. The ride itself justifies the price; there's nothing
quite like the thrill of punching a four-wheeled ATV full throttle
in fifth gear over open sand or riverbeds. Chism can take five
people in a Suburban to see ancient cave paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20 miles to the south and inland, Parque Zoological
Santiago _ described as the only zoo in the state _ is utterly
remarkable in how close visitors can get to the animals. At less
than 3 feet from a tiger, you earn an entirely new respect for
Siegfried &AMP; Roy.
</P>
<P>
   The well-groomed grounds and neatly kept buildings are perhaps
the East Cape's most pleasant surprise. The compact facility was
completed in July 1983, reportedly built with funds raised by
politicians' wives as a way to give something back to the
community. Look for ring-tailed cats, an ocelot, a badger and a
snake pit with coiled rattlers. Cactus provides a contrasting
backdrop to the black bear display. Footpaths are framed with
plumeria, mangos, Spanish dagger and wild plum. A mural depicts the
Pueblo de Santiago y Mision in 1768.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Santiago itself is a government center. A museum
with erratic hours pays tribute to the largely defunct sugar crop
that helped define the area in earlier days. The town's namesake
hotel is thought to have been one of the places where
then-president Dwight D. Eisenhower and the Secret Service slept
during many dove-hunting and big-game-fishing trips to the East
Cape during his administration.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, fishing _ the East Cape's bread and butter _ is a
given. Boats and crews go for $225 to $400 or more per day, with
fishing licenses, bait, rental gear and tips extra.
</P>
<P>
   And, heck, if you can't go another day without more socializing,
music and dancing, $120 will rent a taxi to Cabo San Lucas for the
entire day, and the driver will serve as the guide. But save that
as a last resort for this resort.

   WASHINGTON _ The armor cracked.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive outer shield that has protected Texas Gov. George
W. Bush's presidential campaign _ his image as politically
invincible, a sure winner _ suddenly looked dangerously porous last
week.
</P>
<P>
   It was a small verbal stumble. But a stumble it was, loaded with
grave implications for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Bush not only failed in a television interviewer's surprise quiz
to name four foreign leaders presiding over current hot spots, but
reruns of the interview show him sputtering, growing cranky and
looking decidedly unpresidential.
</P>
<P>
   He was tongue-tied, rattled and uninformed. Not quite down to
Dan Quayle's baffled level, but a bit reminiscent of it.
</P>
<P>
   As a singular episode, his blooper could be forgotten as the
campaign moves on to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   But it reinforces a growing impression that when it comes to
foreign policy, he would need a lot of on-the-job training in the
White House. At the moment domestic issues dominate the contest.
But if some terrorist nation creates alarming havoc next year, the
campaign focus will shift to international concerns, and Bush will
be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   His performance also raises questions about how well he handles
the unexpected. Presidents cannot always anticipate what crises
will land on their desks. They cannot always follow a rehearsed
script. Yet they are required to project the public image of a
reassuring statesman, no matter how privately confused they are.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, caught unprepared, was not fleet-of-foot in the leadership
department. He rushed forward to say later that it wasn't important
to know the name of every foreign leader because people make their
choice based ``upon judgment, based upon vision, based upon
philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that would be very nice. But on global issues we don't
know what Bush's judgment, vision and philosophy are.
</P>
<P>
   While floundering over the name of the Pakistani general who
seized power from a democratically elected leader in a military
coup last month, Bush rashly called the coup ``good news'' because,
he said, it would bring ``stability'' to the country. Challenged on
this interpretation, he claimed to be echoing the Clinton
administration's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials had not, in fact, declared the coup
good news, although they had carefully expressed a wish that the
troubled region would now stabilize so that Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf
could meet his pledge to restore democracy. The difference in the
two positions may be lost on most voters, but it goes to the heart
of diplomatic dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush didn't understand or couldn't articulate the nuanced
administration position _ or take an independent one of his own.
Instead of implying preliminary and temporary passivity, he sounded
as though he endorsed the military coup. He forgot to plump for a
return to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of clumsiness can be overcome with experience and
expert advice, but why go that route when there are other
candidates already prepped?
</P>
<P>
   The case for electing a governor to the presidency is that he or
she has actually run something, but the power is strictly local.
Senators and vice presidents have the responsibility for national
and international issues and possess the knowledge this experience
brings.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore and Sen. John McCain, steeped in this
sort of stuff, probably knew those answers all along, although they
have been briefed by now, and it's too late to find out. Former
Sen. Bill Bradley, first up to face a sequel question about foreign
leadership, replied with aplomb that he simply wouldn't play that
game. A smart answer indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Not many of us, myself included, could have recalled without
prompting the names of the leaders of Chechnya, Taiwan, India and
Pakistan. But we are not running for president and we will never
have to form the American policy toward those countries nor deal
with those leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The quiz, a perfectly legitimate journalistic enterprise, may
mean more in the long run than it does now because it seems part of
a pattern of a serious knowledge gap. Bush has mixed up other names
and places if they don't happen to be near Texas (Mexican names
trip easily from his tongue).
</P>
<P>
   He has called Kosovars ``Kosvarians,'' Greeks ``Grecians,'' East
Timorese ``East Timorians'' and has confused Slovakia and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Bush has benefited greatly from the political truism
that to get ahead it's not what you know, it's whom you know. Maybe
it is only fair that the reverse can also be true: those he doesn't
know are suddenly becoming important.

EXHIBIT ASKS TO LOOK ANEW AT GEORGIA O'KEEFFE'S WORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   So, you think you know Georgia O'Keeffe? Painter of the
uber-flower, partner and muse to photographer Alfred Stieglitz, New
Mexico desert dweller.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you know something of O'Keeffe. After all, her images and
her image are everywhere, on posters and notecards and calendars _
the poppies, the deer skulls, Ghost Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you probably don't know O'Keeffe the way the Dallas
Museum of Art would like you to know her. ``Georgia O'Keeffe: The
Poetry of Things'' hopes to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the DMA unveils the latest tribute to the celebrated
American artist, who died in 1986 just shy of her 100th birthday.
The traveling exhibition, jointly organized by the DMA and the
Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C., comprises 59 paintings,
watercolors and works on paper that span O'Keeffe's 60-year career.
Her admirers will undoubtedly recognize many of the images, but the
point here is not just to give this well-known oeuvre another
public showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Poetry of Things'' asks us to look anew at O'Keeffe, and
to do so by understanding her aesthetic philosophy. Why did
O'Keeffe paint the things she did in the way she did, and what was
she trying to communicate through her art?
</P>
<P>
   ``People tend to look at her paintings like posters,'' said Beth
Turner, the Phillips Collection curator who organized the show.
``They think they've already seen it; they think they know it. But
the experience of her work in person ... is something that is quite
remarkable and in some cases overpowering.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner said she conceived the exhibition because ``I just
thought people had stopped really looking at her paintings and I
wanted them to understand the source of her invention.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition originated in April in Washington, D.C., and
traveled to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, N.M., over the
summer. When ``The Poetry of Things'' leaves Dallas on Jan. 30, the
Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco will be its final destination.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe was, in some sense, a still-life painter, albeit one
who turned the traditional ideas of representation on their head,
said Marjorie Balge-Crozier, an independent scholar and author of
one of two essays in the exhibition catalog. Instead of rendering
objects exactly as they looked, O'Keeffe painted them according to
how they made her feel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is less real than realism,'' the artist said in 1922.
``Details are confusing. It is only by selection, by elimination,
by emphasis that we get at the real meaning of things.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, this was a truly innovative way of thinking _ and
painting. Over the next decade, O'Keeffe's flowers, although copied
from real life, would assume mythological proportions and pulsate
with color. Without titles, some of them might easily be mistaken
for completely abstract designs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe was ``revitalizing perhaps the most tradition-bound
genre in painting (still lifes) by trying to make the most familiar
objects look new and different and strange, so you can't just
dismiss them,'' said Eleanor Jones Harvey, the DMA's consulting
curator of American art and local curator of ``The Poetry of
Things.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition singles out two people who figured prominently in
the development of O'Keeffe's aesthetic: the artist and teacher
Arthur Wesley Dow and the Russian abstractionist Wassily Kandinsky.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe began studying with Dow in 1914, when she was 26 and
attending Columbia University's Teachers College in New York City.
(At this point, she had already spent two years as ``supervisor of
drawing and penmanship'' with the City Public School in Amarillo,
and would return to teach art at West Texas State Normal College in
Canyon, Texas, in 1918).
</P>
<P>
   Dow's philosophy incorporated principles of Asian art,
emphasizing form and composition over ``mere accuracy.'' His notion
of ``filling space in a beautiful way'' captivated O'Keeffe, and in
1915, she began a series of charcoal abstractions that led to her
first exhibition at Alfred Stieglitz's cutting-edge New York
gallery, 291. (She and Stieglitz married in 1924, and to this day
their pairing and personalities generate almost as much interest as
their artwork).
</P>
<P>
   Kandinsky influenced O'Keeffe through his book ``Concerning the
Spiritual in Art,'' published in the United States in 1914. The
Russian artist believed that color could convey emotion, and that
``an image could almost vibrate like music,'' Harvey explained.
``And there are some images of flowers in this exhibition that
really do vibrate in that kind of way.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe synthesized both men's philosophies to come up with her
own extraordinary vision. In it, objects are boiled down to their
simplest essences or blown up to otherworldly proportions. Bones
that appear mammoth-sized frame desert landscapes or float above
them, defying gravity. Clamshells and jack-in-the-pulpits assume
sexual overtones.
</P>
<P>
   The sensuality of O'Keeffe's flower paintings has always
provoked debate, with critics viewing some as metaphors for female
sexuality or depictions of female genitalia. While O'Keeffe
rejected this interpretation of her work, art historians tend to
agree that she knew what she was doing.

   100 Eyes, One Insect
</P>
<P>
   The night may have a thousand eyes, as countless lounge singers
have crooned, but a parasitic insect that lives in wasps is no
slouch in the optics department either. It has 100.
</P>
<P>
   The insect, Xenos peckii, has two raspberry-like structures on
its head, each of which has about 50 lenses. Researchers at Cornell
University have discovered that each of the lenses has its own
retina. Beneath this are other tissues that help process the images
projected by the lens.
</P>
<P>
   These structures are far different from the compound eyes found
in many insects. Common fruit flies, for example, have about 700
lens facets on each eye, but each contributes to only one sample
point that is processed by the insect.
</P>
<P>
   The larger lenses of X. peckii function as small, independent
eyes, each focusing a chunk, rather than a point, of the visual
field. The researchers, who described their studies in the journal
Science, call these lens-retina combinations eyelets.
</P>
<P>
   All those complex visual signals require a lot of processing
power, far more than would be needed if just points were being
processed. The researchers found that optical fibers constitute
about three-quarters of X. peckii's brain.
</P>
<P>
   Stereophonic Nose
</P>
<P>
   In human hearing, subtle differences in the sound that reaches
the two ears help the listener determine the qualities of the
sound. Now, researchers at Stanford University have shown that the
nose works in stereo too.
</P>
<P>
   In a nose, one nostril is always slightly swollen, and the
swelling switches between the two nostrils every few hours. The
Stanford scientists, writing in the journal Nature, discovered that
the two nostrils sense odors slightly differently, depending upon
the rate of airflow through them (the swollen nostril slightly
constricting the amount of air).
</P>
<P>
   The different chemical compounds that make up an odor must first
be absorbed by and cross the nose's mucous membranes before they
produce a response in the olfactory nerve. And some compounds are
absorbed more rapidly than others.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found that a rapidly absorbing component induces
a smaller response when there is less airflow (because it is
absorbed only in a small part of the membrane, the front portion),
and a larger one when there is more airflow (and the chemical has a
chance to spread to more of the membrane before being absorbed).
</P>
<P>
   A slower-absorbing compound has the opposite effect, inducing a
smaller response when there is greater airflow (as the chemical has
less chance to be absorbed). So for any given odor, the two
nostrils provide slightly different responses to the brain. The
researchers suggest that this enhances the sense of smell.
</P>
<P>
   Square Dance in the Sky
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have found evidence of another planet outside the
solar system. This one comes with a twist: it is the first to
accompany a pair of stars.
</P>
<P>
   As with the roughly 20 other extrasolar planets discovered
previously, the new planet, which has a mass about three times that
of Jupiter, was observed indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, astronomers from Notre Dame, the University of
Washington and several other institutions analyzed what is known as
a ``gravitational lensing'' event. Such an event occurs when a
distant object passes behind a closer one.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers can determine the details of the closer object by
studying how its gravitational forces affect the light from the
more distant one.
</P>
<P>
   Although they caution that there could be other explanations for
what they observed, the astronomers, writing in the journal Nature,
say that the closer object is likely to be a pair of stars,
orbiting each other at a distance about twice that of the Earth to
the Sun. And the planet is orbiting both stars at a distance about
seven times that of the Earth-Sun distance.

UNDATED: she was doing. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``There are still people who don't want to look at these
things,'' said Balge-Crozier, referring to anecdotes she heard from
Phillips Collection docents about visitors turning away from
certain flower paintings in discomfort. ``Because it's so
in-your-face; it's not a comfortable distance. That's a very
powerful thing for her to have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than organize the exhibit chronologically as in
Washington, Harvey chose to group the works by subject matter in
each of the four galleries. Images of crosses, bones and clouds
represent themes of time and transcendence, and 13 flower paintings
hang together in the final gallery. The point is to see ``how
O'Keeffe manipulated a certain subject over time,'' Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second gallery, for instance, three paintings of red
calla lilies from 1919, 1923 and 1924 reveal O'Keeffe's
progressively abstract treatment of the flower.
</P>
<P>
   In the first work, a watercolor, she centers several blooms and
a stem in the middle of the paper. In the second, a small oil
painting, she confines the image to a tumult of red petal forms.
And in the third, the largest canvas, O'Keeffe dives into the
center of the flower and takes us with her until we're immersed in
an emotional geyser of pinks, reds and yellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was profoundly, profoundly aware of the beauty of
nature,'' said Barbara Lynes, curator of the Georgia O'Keeffe
Museum in Santa Fe, which hosted the exhibition this summer. ``She
was continually trying to convey the essence of that to the world,
to convey her own experience of the singularity and beauty of the
world. And that's one thing the exhibition brings to you.''
</P>
<P>
   For Harvey, the meaning of the exhibit balances on the grouping
of three seemingly unrelated paintings that begin the show.
</P>
<P>
   O'Keeffe painted ``Dead Rabbit With Copper Pot'' in 1908 while
studying under still-life virtuoso William Merritt Chase at the Art
Students League in New York. The work, which won first prize in
Chase's class, appears surprisingly traditional, especially next to
the stark ``Green Apple on Black Plate'' from 1922 and almost
surreal ``Fishhook From Hawaii No. I,'' painted in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   But in all three cases, the objects seem about to float
unanchored in space, and, as with the fishhook, seem questionable
in scale. These are themes O'Keeffe will return to throughout her
career.
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, O'Keeffe found her spiritual home in New Mexico, where
the desert landscape seemed to beg for artistic exploration. Bones,
crosses and her own adobe homes eventually take the place of
flowers and leaves as the objects through which O'Keeffe conveys
her response to the natural, and ephemeral, world. A series of
airplane rides prompt her to paint ``It Was Yellow and Pink II''
(1959), a dreamlike vision of land and river, and ``Sky Above
Clouds III'' (1963), a vista of ever-shrinking white lily pads.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, ``The Poetry of Things'' focuses heavily on early
O'Keeffe from the 1920s and '30s, ``the seminal works that put her
on the map,'' Harvey said. The artworks here come from 27
collections and include several paintings that rarely leave their
owners' hands, such as ``Red Canna'' from 1923. Favorites
``Poppy,'' ``The Lawrence Tree'' and ``Ladder to the Moon'' are
included, too.
</P>
<P>
   But again, Harvey and the DMA hope that visitors to ``The Poetry
of Things'' will examine O'Keeffe's familiar images in a way they
haven't done before.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people have been content to look at and read the surfaces
of the pictures and her life ... and not bother to delve into an
aesthetic philosophy,'' Harvey said. ``Part of that may be the fact
that as a woman artist, as someone who was alternately charming and
cantankerous, seductive and craggy, she was as fascinating a
character _ or more so _ than her paintings, and therefore that was
a rich enough field to mine.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Harvey added, ``O'Keeffe never really talked
about her aesthetic philosophy publicly during her career. I think
she felt strongly that the paintings had to speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The concepts that propel ``The Poetry of Things,'' especially
those contained in the catalog, may be confusing for the art
neophyte. But Harvey stressed that viewers need only grasp the
basic principle behind O'Keeffe's works to learn from and savor the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are a lot worse ways to spend an afternoon than
contemplating the luxurious petals of a Georgia O'Keeffe petunia.

DOCTORS ALARMED BY INCREASE IN CHILDREN WITH RESPIRATORY DISEASE

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the typical kindergarten class of 20 children today, at least
one child has asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma is out of control.
</P>
<P>
   The respiratory disease sends more than 570,000 children to
emergency rooms each year gasping for breath. It accounts for more
than 10 million lost school days for children under age 15. And
asthma rates continue to rise, especially among young children;
since 1980, there's been an alarming 160 percent increase in the
disease in children under age 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``These statistics should disturb us. Uncontrolled asthma is
unacceptable,''said Dr. Gail Shapiro, co-chairwoman of the American
Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's committee to develop
guidelines for identifying and treating asthma in children.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the nation's leading pediatric and asthma experts
released the first comprehensive medical guide for managing asthma
in children and launched a ``Best Practice'' initiative aimed at
raising the standard of care.
</P>
<P>
   The new diagnosis and treatment guidelines are a joint effort of
major health organizations that deal with children and asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing more frightening than watching a small child
struggling for air,'' said Dr. Gary Rachelefsky, whose young
granddaughter has asthma.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is lucky. She has been properly diagnosed and is getting
appropriate treatment with adequate medications, but many children
suffer with asthma every day,'' Rachelefsky said. He is past
president of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology
and is co-chairman of the new initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asthma is a tremendously visible disease today that causes a
tremendous decrease in quality of life for about 5 million children
... and most of that decrease is preventable,'' Rachelefsky said.
``We are alarmed and deeply disturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls asthma in children one of the most crucial
public-health issues of our time and says the disturbing statistics
demand a concerted initiative to ensure that children receive the
best care, regardless of where they live, whether or not they have
health insurance or whether they see an asthma specialist, a family
physician, a pediatrician or other health-care provider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asthma can be and should be controlled. ... Something needs to
be done, something very big,'' Rachelefsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the reasons for the increase in asthma remain unclear,
contributing factors include: children spending more time indoors,
where they are exposed to allergens such as dust mites, pets,
cigarette smoke and roaches, which trigger asthma attacks; more
young children in day-care programs where they are exposed to viral
triggers earlier; and many children misdiagnosed with a cough or
bronchitis and treated with antibiotics, which do nothing to help
asthma.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half the children with asthma are not being treated
because their asthma has not been diagnosed, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines are the first step to providing ongoing care
that's not just hit and miss, Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be available on a new Web site by year's
end.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines will offer recommendations for the assessment and
monitoring of children with asthma; ways to control factors that
contribute to severity, such as viral upper-respiratory infections,
tobacco and wood smoke, dust mites, animal dander, cockroach
allergens and indoor mold; step-by-step pharmacologic therapy,
including both long-term control drugs and quick-relief
medications; and patient education.

WHAT PARENTS CAN DO FOR CHILDREN WITH ASTHMA

<TEXT>
<P>
   To keep medications at a minimum, the new pediatric asthma
guidelines recommend ways to reduce exposure to major indoor
triggers for asthma, including tobacco and smoke; allergens to
which the child is sensitive, such as dust mites, cockroaches,
molds and animal dander; and other airborne irritants, such as
fumes and odors.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKE: Permit no smoking around the child or in the child's
home; help parents and caregivers quit smoking; eliminate use of
wood stoves and fireplaces.
</P>
<P>
   DUST MITES: Encase the child's mattress and box springs in an
allergen-impermeable cover; cover the pillow in an
allergen-impermeable case or wash weekly in hot water; remove
carpets from bedroom; have child avoid sleeping or lying on
upholstered furniture and carpets; minimize stuffed animals in
child's bedroom; reduce indoor humidity to less than 50 percent;
wash stuffed toys weekly in hot water.
</P>
<P>
   ANIMAL DANDER: If possible, remove pets and any products made
from feathers from the home. At least keep the pet out of the
child's bedroom and keep the bedroom door closed; keep the pet off
upholstered furniture and carpets; wash the pet weekly to decrease
dander, urine and dried saliva; and use a filter on air ducts in a
child's room.
</P>
<P>
   COCKROACH ALLERGENS: Do not leave food or garbage exposed;
reduce indoor humidity to less than 50 percent; fix leaky faucets
and pipes; use boric acid traps (avoid using poison around young
children).
</P>
<P>
   INDOOR MOLD: Fix leaky faucets and pipes; avoid vaporizers;
reduce indoor humidity to less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   VIRAL INFECTIONS: Get flu shots each fall for children who are
not allergic to eggs; limit exposure to anyone with a viral
infection.

TURNING THE PEOPLE'S BUSINESS INTO A POP-QUIZ GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American people have long suspected that the nation's media
are trivializing the people's business, especially the business of
elections.
</P>
<P>
   And now our suspicions have been confirmed. Last week, a TV
reporter in Boston officially turned coverage of the 2000
presidential election into a game of Trivial Pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Seems this guy figured it would be a great idea to test the
foreign affairs expertise of Republican front-runner George W. Bush
by challenging Bush to name the leaders of Chechnya, Taiwan, India
and Pakistan _ four countries whose leaders' names are so obscure
that citizens of the countries in question might be hard-pressed to
guess them.
</P>
<P>
   Bush flunked the test, such as it was, correctly naming only one
of the leaders. Al Gore, Bush's likely Democratic opponent in the
general election, promptly dispatched one of his flacks to proclaim
that the vice president would have answered all four correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, me too. And I correctly listed Wednesday night's Lotto
Texas numbers _ on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   There are two issues here, one being whether a presidential
candidate should be expected to memorize the name of every leader
of every foreign country so as to be prepared when some jerk with a
microphone decides to spring a ``pop quiz,'' as the media have been
calling this exchange.
</P>
<P>
   I say: Of course not. But don't take my word for it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not, says no less an authority than George
Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
   A former communications czar in the Clinton White House and
currently a commentator for ABC News, Stephanopoulos is certainly
no fan of office-seekers named Bush. But he described the Boston
reporter's questions as a ``cheap shot'' and said he doubted that
anyone could have answered all four on a moment's notice.
</P>
<P>
   The second issue is whether this sort of cheap-shot interviewing
is a legitimate journalistic technique. Oddly enough, this very
subject came up recently in the context of sports reporter Jim
Gray's ambush interview with ex-baseball star Pete Rose _ and the
consensus among the public, if not the media, seemed to be that
it's not legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, of course, is that few interviewers, especially TV
interviewers, have any interest whatsoever in obtaining information
from the interviewee. More often than not, the purpose of
interviews is not to enlighten the audience but to showcase the
interviewers, to hype their ratings and promote their careers by
enhancing their reputations as tough questioners.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was in the case of Andy Hiller of Boston's WHDH-TV,
who ``is known locally for asking sassy questions of political
leaders,'' according to The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The operative word here is ``sassy,'' for which my computer's
thesaurus offers a number of synonyms. Among them:
``disrespectful,'' ``rude,'' ``surly'' and ``wisenheimer.''
</P>
<P>
   I especially like ``wisenheimer,'' which is more polite than a
shorter word beginning with the same four letters but which clearly
addresses the attitude of the person described. Hiller wasn't
trying to help his audience assess Bush's qualifications for the
presidency; he was showing off.
</P>
<P>
   The public is on to this stuff, of course, and has learned to
keep the media grandstanding in perspective. Voters know that if
the president of the United States needs to know the name of a
foreign leader, he only has to snap his fingers and he will have
it, along with every documented fact about the leader's personal
and professional background and some secrets that the leader may
not have shared with his most intimate associates.
</P>
<P>
   Even Clinton conceded that quiz-show questions about foreign
leaders miss the point. Here's what the president told ``Good
Morning America,'' as quoted by the AP:
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is, Do you have a clear idea of what
the world oughta look like and what America's policy oughtta be in
these areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has a very clear idea about the world and America's role in
it. Maybe some enterprising interviewer should ask him about that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   As overfishing depletes the seas of prized species like cod,
tuna and swordfish, conservation groups are urging consumers to
make dining choices they say will help damaged ecosystems recover
and support sustainable fisheries. Their lists recommend seafoods
to eat and avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an environmental problem whose solution is in your hands
every time you buy seafood,'' says the Monterey Bay Aquarium's
seafood guide, which made its debut last month. ``Make wise choices
and you help assure healthy oceans for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium, in Monterey, Calif., lists 11 species that it
calls best choices, 14 that are potential problems and 15 that are
better to avoid. Proposed for prohibition are such fish as cod,
American lobster, monkfish, orange roughy, Chilean sea bass, shark,
prawns, swordfish and bluefin tuna, all of whose populations are in
decline or headed there.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the proposed taboos are based on habitat
destruction and risk, rather than population drops. For instance,
the aquarium urges consumers to avoid farmed salmon because the
ocean pens in which they live can pollute the water with feces and
spread disease.
</P>
<P>
   It adds that farmed salmon are usually Atlantic in origin _ even
those raised in Pacific waters. Salmon that escape can cause
problems for native populations, the aquarium says.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the aquarium gives a thumbs up to wild Alaskan
salmon. These fisheries, it says, are healthy, well-regulated and
``the most environmentally sound choice.''
</P>
<P>
   A final criterion in the aquarium's rankings is the size of the
fishery's bycatch _ unwanted creatures that are caught
inadvertently and thrown back, usually dead. For instance, its
guide lists albacore tuna as a potential problem because some
methods of catching them kill dolphins, sea birds and tons of
untargeted fish.
</P>
<P>
   Similar campaigns have been mounted by the National Audubon
Society and are planned by the Environmental Defense Fund. Experts
say such efforts are starting to unnerve seafood companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are running scared,'' said Michael Sutton, head of
the fisheries program at the Packard Foundation, based in Los
Altos, Calif., which this year is spending $7 million to spur
sustainable fisheries. ``Their customers are beginning to become
better informed. That's a real change. It's not just green
consumers any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Seafood producers say they applaud the goal of sustainable
fisheries but not necessarily the environmentalist tactics. In some
cases, they suggest, the groups overstate the woes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can do more harm than good,'' said Justin LeBlanc, head
of government relations for the National Fisheries Institute, a
trade association of the seafood industry based in Arlington, Va.
``If you take away the marketplace, you remove the incentive for
effective management and for fishermen to do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   A growing number of people prefer fish to red meat or chicken as
a way to promote health and longevity. But worldwide, after
centuries of steady growth, the total catch of wild fish peaked in
1989 and has since declined or plateaued for most species,
prompting efforts to avoid population crashes and the possibility
in some cases of extinction of stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite remedial efforts and scattered improvements, the
overfishing problem is generally seen as getting worse. By some
estimates, more than two-thirds of all commercially important fish
populations are now classified as ``fully fished'' or ``over
exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the National Marine Fisheries Service, the federal
agency that oversees the nation's commercial fishing fleets, issued
an annual report to Congress that said 98 species were now
overfished, up from 90 last year. Among the new additions are the
Georgs Bank cod, the Bering Sea snow crab, the yellowtail flounder
and the Gulf of Maine haddock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This report is significant because it provides the clearest
picture of the precarious state of the nation's fisheries that
we've seen to date,'' said Lee Crockett, executive director of the
Marine Fish Conservation Network, which is based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The effort to guide consumer choices made a surprisingly strong
debut last year when the Natural Resources Defense Council and
SeaWeb, a conservation project of the Pew Charitable Trusts,
mounted a successful effort to ``Give Swordfish a Break'' because
of population drops. The effort prompted many restaurants,
including some top New York City establishments, to forgo the
delicacy. Market prices for swordfish dropped.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign irked commercial fisherman and some federal
regulators, who said it ignored American efforts to rebuild fallen
swordfish stocks. The problem, some regulators said, was foreign
states that ignored quotas and fishing agreements.
</P>
<P>
   After the swordfish effort, the push widened last year as the
Living Oceans Program of the National Audubon Society, based in
Islip, N.Y., published a guide to seafood that made recommendations
among 21 species, later expanded to 34 species.
</P>
<P>
   The ratings ranged from green to red _ from fine for dining
(tilapia, striped bass, mahi-mahi) to better left uneaten (snapper,
grouper, Atlantic halibut). ``As you can imagine, not everybody in
the red category was pleased with us,'' said Dr. Carl Safina, who
heads the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Living Oceans Program is now publishing the Audubon Seafood
Lover's Almanac, a 96-page guide due out in January that expands on
the advice. ``Bluefish,'' the almanac says, ``is one of the very
few fish for which fishing controls were put in place before
problems began.'' On the same page, it gives a bluefish recipe,
Lady M's Marinade, laced with ginger, parsley, oregano and basil.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Monterey Bay Aquarium say its own Seafood Watch
program began in an effort to assess whether its restaurant and
catered events were practicing what the organization preached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with our menu, things we serve here,'' said Sue
Lisin, a Monterey research biologist who heads Seafood Watch. She
added that the seafood recommendations, posted on the aquarium's
Web site (www.montereybayaquarium.org), would change with fishery
ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Ms. Lisin said, snow crabs, now listed as a
potential problem for sea-friendly consumers, may soon move into
the avoid column since their Alaskan fishery is in decline. ``It's
looking very bad,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Defense Fund, based in New York City, is
setting up a Web site tentatively called Seafood Scorecard, which
will give consumer advice with a special emphasis on aquaculture,
which globally now accounts for more than 25 percent of all
seafood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong need and a big market for knowing what's
environmentally sound,'' said Dr. Rebecca J. Goldburg, a senior
scientist at the fund. ``A lot of folks are interested.''

   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ John Vanderford leans on his wooden level
and surveys the nearly completed 1-story structure that will soon
be the home of Jerry and Karen Price.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors would frown if they could see Vanderford, decked out
in blue-and-white-striped overalls and a yellow baseball cap that
reads ``Building for the Glory of God.'' He has bone cancer and has
been told by his doctors to limit his physical activity.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't stop Vanderford, 76, of Tulsa from helping
build houses for those left devastated by the Oklahoma tornadoes
six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not supposed to be able to work anymore _ so say the
doctors,'' Vanderford said. ``Doctors don't know everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Oklahoma and the nation, people are setting aside the
comfort of their homes, their jobs and, in some cases, their
retirement to help families that were wiped out financially by a
series of tornadoes that pummeled the Oklahoma City area May 3.
</P>
<P>
   Project Rebuild links the volunteers, many of whom are members
of religious disaster missions, with the Oklahoma Lumbermen's
Association. The association gathers donated building materials;
the volunteers supply the labor.
</P>
<P>
   Bridge Creek, an unincorporated farming community in Grady
County, is receiving most of the project's attention. Grady County
officials estimate that about 50 percent of those affected by the
tornadoes had inadequate insurance or none at all.
</P>
<P>
   About 16 homes are under construction there.
</P>
<P>
   One house will be home to a couple who spent months living in a
tent and trailer without electricity or plumbing. A bucket served
as their toilet. Another will shelter a single mother and her
14-year-old daughter, a former cheerleader who was paralyzed in the
tornado and now uses a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   But Dale Thompson wonders whether some well-intentioned
volunteers may inadvertently be putting families in harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, the Grady County emergency management coordinator,
said a few professional contractors have expressed concern that
some of the volunteers who are helping build houses may not be
qualified. The county has no code enforcement officer to ensure the
quality of work being completed, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these volunteers have their heart in the right place,
but we're worried about whether things are actually brought up to
code,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharilyn Young, executive vice president of the Oklahoma
Lumbermen's Association, said the association is making every
effort to ensure that homes are built correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Experienced retired builders are assigned to oversee volunteers
at each construction site, she said. And an independent building
contractor inspects each framed structure before drywall is
installed, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a conscience about building property,'' Young said.
``We are not out to build a home that won't meet the test of time
and quality and usability and wearability. The point is most of
them are getting a better place to live than they ever have had
before.''
</P>
<P>
   After eight years in a mobile home, Charlene and Tommy Stone, a
disabled couple on welfare, are thrilled that they will be in a new
house by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first started talking about building me a house, I
thought, `I don't believe it. This doesn't happen to me,' '' said
Charlene Stone, 55.
</P>
<P>
   Now she can glance through her trailer window at the tan,
1-story house that has risen where only red clay had been before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people from Georgia, Alabama, Florida, West Virginia
and Missouri here,'' Stone said. ``My house is being built by
everybody. I never knew people could help like they have.''
</P>
<P>
   On a hill where Ridgecrest Baptist Church once stood, about a
dozen recreational vehicles serve as homes for out-of-town
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically have an RV city at the church,'' said pastor Tom
Duckett. ``We have folks that don't come in under any typical flag.
They just come in to work. Some will stay for a week, others
several months.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanderford and his wife, Myra, have lived in a small trailer
home for almost two months.
</P>
<P>
   A builder by trade, Vanderford retired 13 years ago but is a
member of the state disaster team for the Southern Baptists. He is
a volunteer coordinator but can't resist helping with the
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've only got maybe one talent, and I don't want to lose it,''
he said jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderford said he chooses to spend his retirement helping
others because ``I'm going to wear out, not rest out.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who are helping have brought their families with them.
</P>
<P>
   David Leid, his then pregnant wife, and their six children had
just completed nine months working in flood-devastated Cuero,
southeast of San Antonio, when they received word that Christian
Aid Ministries was needed in Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   In a temporary building set up in a city park in Newcastle, Leid
and a small staff coordinate the influx of Mennonite and Amish
volunteers from as far away as Pennsylvania and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The building has been transformed into a home away from home for
the volunteers. Curtains adorn the windows and inspirational
posters decorate the walls. A full kitchen has been installed for
the women to cook for their families and other volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Sullivan left his own carpentry business in Oregon to help.
His wife, Lori, said the couple and their two young children
brought only what would fit in their car trunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned we can be satisfied and live with less,'' said Lori
Sullivan, 25, pausing as she sewed curtains. ``You just don't need
it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most staff members sleep in the recreational vehicles
parked outside, Leid rents a home to house his wife and seven
children, who range in age from 14 years to 3 weeks. The children
are home-schooled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been the children's life for the last two years, so
they love it,'' Leid said. ``We feel this is the Lord's will for
our lives to do this.''

   BRIDGE CREEK, Okla. _ Handwritten quotations from Scripture peek
out from behind the spackle on the wallboard of the Dawsons' future
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesus is King of Kings. Lord of Lords.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, Lord, for this house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to inspire yourself somehow when you do this,'' a
weary Detra Dawson, 27, said as she worked on a living-room wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Dawsons, like many residents in tiny Bridge Creek, had no
insurance and were financially wiped out when a tornado ripped
apart their mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, through faith, hard work and an assistance program
called Project Rebuild, the family is completing work on a
three-bedroom, two-bath house all their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe nothing on it,'' beamed David Dawson, 28. ``It's ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Project Rebuild, spearheaded by the Oklahoma Lumbermen's
Association, has committed to help build up to 40 homes for
low-income, elderly and disabled people in Bridge Creek, an
unincorporated area in Grady County.
</P>
<P>
   The project screened Oklahomans who received grant money from
the Federal Emergency Management Agency to identify the neediest
families.
</P>
<P>
   Lumber and building industry officials have donated more than
$2.2 million worth of materials. Church organizations and
volunteers build the homes using adapted Red Cross floor plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're doing really is giving them a fresh start so
they're not encumbered with debt,'' said Sharilyn Young, executive
vice president of the Lumberman's Association. ``A lot of them
couldn't get a home loan if they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Thompson, emergency management coordinator for Grady
County, said that about 25 percent of Bridge Creek families
affected by the tornadoes had no insurance. Another 25 percent were
underinsured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   David Dawson, a self-employed builder, made about $40,000 a year
but couldn't afford insurance on his mobile home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever try putting insurance on a mobile home? It's
high, about three times higher than a house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado left him homeless and jobless. A shed containing
tools worth an estimated $60,000 and a car full of machinery from a
recent project disappeared in the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found one socket (wrench) a foot and a half underground when
I was digging a post hole,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Project Rebuild has given the Dawsons $10,000 worth of building
materials. Dawson has done much of the work himself. He pays for
materials for the rest of the house using money from a $13,600 FEMA
grant and earnings from subcontracting work.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the couple, their three young children and Detra
Dawson's mother cram into a trailer on their property. They rise
early each morning to work on the home, eager to move in by
Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The family has lived in mobile homes for the past four years.
David Dawson says never again. In trailers, utility bills and
insurance are higher and the home depreciates with time.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a house, you don't have cold air going up through the
floor,'' he said. ``There's no comparison.''
</P>
<P>
   And this time, Dawson can afford the insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lord has really blessed us tremendously because he gave us
better than we had before,'' Detra Dawson said. ``I was satisfied
with what we had before, but this is better.''

MARINE VETERAN CAN'T ESCAPE `FOUR MINUTES OF TERROR'

<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Thunder and rain bring back those ``four minutes
of terror,'' leaving Pat McNabb trembling.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers the wind in his face and the distinctive smell _ a
combination of rain, dust, insulation and debris.
</P>
<P>
   It matters little that McNabb, 42, suffered only minor physical
injuries when an F5 tornado, a twister with winds of 261 to 318
mph, leveled his home and buried him in debris. The emotional
wounds cut deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did almost six years in the Marine Corps,'' McNabb said.
``This tops anything I experienced there because you can't fight
back. There's no one to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Those feelings of helplessness have surfaced for many
Oklahomans, even those who were not directly affected by May's
tornadoes, counselors say.
</P>
<P>
   ``A natural disaster like that is unpredictable,'' said Rosemary
Brown, communications director of Project Heartland, a counseling
program started after the 1995 terrorist bombing of the Oklahoma
City federal building. ``It could have been you, and it still could
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Through September, Project Heartland has provided free
counseling to 492 clients. The program has served about 34,000 more
through seminars, debriefings and education. The federally funded
project is run by the state Department of Mental Health and
Substance Abuse Services.
</P>
<P>
   Counselors say the number of people seeking assistance is
climbing and may not peak until the one-year anniversary of the
storms in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them are wondering, `It's six months later. Why am I
doing this now? Is there something wrong with me?' '' said Susan
Ray, counselor coordinator with Project Heartland.
</P>
<P>
   Some victims say it helps to simply talk about the tornadoes.
Each day brings healing for McNabb's neighbors, Sherri and David
Kosfeld and their daughters, Kayla, 9, and Ashley, 16.
</P>
<P>
   Their home was destroyed and the closet they huddled in for
safety ended up on its side. Only the Kosfelds and three backpacks
that Ashley had stuffed with Beanie Babies, clean underwear and
photographs remained.
</P>
<P>
   Moving into their rebuilt home last month aided the healing,
Sherri Kosfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first night we were home, I was afraid it was going to be
real hard on all of us,'' she said. ``But we all came in and went
to bed and just crashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, `We're home.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Watching others bounce back quickly made McNabb feel as if his
fear of storms was abnormal.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, a burly man at 6-foot-1 and 245 pounds, is a prison
employee. He wondered how someone who comes face to face with
murderers every day could cower like a child at the approach of a
storm.
</P>
<P>
   When a storm rolls in, McNabb sits glued to the television in
his rental home. When a tornado warning is issued, he plans to jump
into his red 1999 Lincoln Navigator _ with license tag ``F5 SURVR''
_ and head for Tulsa or Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to call in sick at work the next day if we have a night
storm,'' he said. ``I get no sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   McNabb sought the help of a psychologist through his employer.
</P>
<P>
   He was relieved to be told that his fears are normal responses
to a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's like a car wreck and I get over it in a couple of
years,'' he said.

   DEL CITY, Okla. _ Amid the concrete foundations, brick and
2-by-4s, the Burch home represents hope.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, tornadoes destroyed 406 houses in this community
east of Oklahoma City. A month ago, Carolyn and Dale Burch were the
first to return to a rebuilt home in the Del Aire subdivision, the
hardest-hit area of the city.
</P>
<P>
   For many, there was no doubt that they would rebuild.
</P>
<P>
   The Burches wanted to stay where their children had been raised.
Bobby Stewart liked his house's corner location. John Reilly wanted
his 9-year-old daughter, Victoria, to understand that ``sometimes
you've got to look adversity in the eye and kick it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Edwards, city manager of Del City, said the number of
families who chose to rebuild far exceeds those moving elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who couldn't stand the thought of coming back
in here,'' Edwards said. ``And I think some of the people were
waiting to see what kind of houses were going to be built before
they decided.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, like the Burch family, had replacement-cost
insurance. Those with that coverage who rebuilt on the same lot
received as much as 25 percent more than the insured value of their
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Others sold their lots to builders, who are building bigger and
better.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards said typical home appraisals in Del Aire are expected to
increase from less than $70,000 to between $100,000 and $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   Planning for the Burches' brick-and-stone house began almost
immediately after Carolyn Burch, 53, finished a six-week stay at a
local hospital. She was home alone when the tornado ripped through
and left little standing but her locked front door.
</P>
<P>
   A brick bedroom wall toppled onto her and shielded her from
flying debris. But it left her with a brain contusion and a
shattered pelvis. She was in a coma for two days.
</P>
<P>
   On Carolyn Burch's second day out of the hospital, a woman
varnishing the cabinets in the couple's Oklahoma City apartment
mentioned that her brother was a contractor.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the next day I was going through plans, picking out a
house,'' Carolyn Burch said. ``By the next day I was going through
the trim I wanted. I was picking out brick, carpet. We got to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The home was completed in four months.
</P>
<P>
   But the lots on both sides of the Burch home remain empty.
</P>
<P>
   Their former neighbors, Audrey and James ``Mac'' McDonald, a
retired Air Force senior master sergeant, have moved to a new house
in Midwest City.
</P>
<P>
   Rebuilding, Audrey McDonald said, would take too long and revive
too many memories of that tragic day. The couple survived the
tornado huddled beneath a mattress in their bathtub.
</P>
<P>
   Audrey McDonald, 73, said she'll never forget when a neighbor
kicked open her jammed front door and she walked outside to see her
neighborhood of 28 years gone and Carolyn Burch lying injured and
unrecognizable on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The devastation was unbelievable,'' she said. ``I just feel
like every time I stepped out of the door, I would see it.''

SHELTERS BRING PEACE OF MIND IN TORNADO ALLEY

<P>
   MOORE, Okla. _ Even before May's deadly twisters, three business
partners thought that living in the heart of Tornado Alley
presented an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   When a twister destroyed one of their homes and damaged their
auto glass business, they were convinced.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Storm Shelters of Oklahoma has three locations across the
state. The company struggles to keep enough workers on hand to meet
the demand for underground shelters, co-owner Jim Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Oklahoma families, including many whose homes
weren't touched by the tornadoes, are installing storm cellars or
safe rooms in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The protection isn't cheap, but it's worth the investment,
residents say.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy and Cody Nelsen lost their 2-story home in Moore and a
house full of antiques. Their family survived, but they're taking
no chances that closets will protect them next time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though our physical bodies are OK, our kids have been
hurt psychologically,'' Cathy Nelsen said. ``You're supposed to
protect your children. I felt like I put them in harm's way.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of underground shelters averages $2,500 to $3,500,
depending on size.
</P>
<P>
   Safe rooms are a bit more expensive, at about $3,700 to $4,500,
depending on the size. They consist of 6- to 8-inch-thick walls of
reinforced concrete designed to withstand winds of 250 to 300 mph _
comparable to winds during a highly destructive F5 tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Safe rooms typically double as a master bedroom closet, said
Dave Watson, sales manager of Polysteel, a company that builds
them. An entire house can be built with the concrete walls at a
cost of 4 percent to 5 percent above normal construction cost, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To offset the cost, about 7,000 Oklahomans have applied for
$2,000 rebates offered through the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, said Jim Lewellyn, an engineer in Oklahoma City's Public
Works Department.
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds of the people who applied, including Lewellyn,
suffered no damage from the tornado but saw the need for a shelter
after driving through ravaged neighborhoods or watching TV footage
of the destruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``After spending time in those neighborhoods, you want something
more than your bathtub to hide in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Families whose homes suffered 50 percent damage or more are
given first priority, Lewellyn said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelsens are waiting to find out whether they will receive a
rebate. Even if they do not, Cathy Nelsen insists that the shelter
is worth every penny of its $3,500 cost.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the Nelsens filled in an underground shelter on
their property because it frequently flooded with rainwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sons were little at the time, and I was scared they'd fall
in and drown,'' said Nelsen, 33. ``You hear about tornadoes. ...
You just never think it's going to happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, their concrete shelter is empty. The family plans to
transform it into a clubhouse for sons Valen, 11, and Vance, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Two cots will give the boys a safe place to sleep at night if
they're frightened by storms. Animal carriers, to be stacked in one
corner, will protect the family's dogs and cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's never used other than as a clubhouse,'' Cathy
Nelson said, ``it's worth it for the peace of mind.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS'S DOORS OPEN TO WELL-HEELED TECH LOBBY
 &HT;    With TECH-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Nov. 14.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With registered lobbyists now outnumbering members
of Congress roughly 40 to one, most of the men and women who get
paid to influence legislation are having a tough time arranging
meetings with powerful lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But for those lucky lobbyists who represent high-flying
high-tech companies generating enormous fortunes, the doors on
Capitol Hill are swinging open and the phone lines are free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is absolutely overwhelmingly interested in working
with us,'' said Steve Papermaster, an Austin, Texas, entrepreneur
and member of the executive council of Technology Network
(TechNet), a political action group founded two years ago in the
Silicon Valley. ``They are opening their doors. In fact, they are
calling us.''
</P>
<P>
   With politicians now so enamored, bills favorable to technology
companies have been speeding through an otherwise listless
Congress. In just little more than the past year, the
Republican-led Congress and Democratic White House have agreed to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Impose a three-year moratorium on taxes on electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit lawsuits against companies involved with Y2K-related
software flaws.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extend copyright protections to material published on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, most members of Congress still thought the Web
was something you took care of by swiping a broom in the corner.
This year, committee hearings lavished attention on the issues of
Internet privacy, encryption, e-mail marketing and more.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists and lawmakers alike say the dramatic change was caused
by one thing: money. Big piles of money on Wall Street. Money back
in the home districts where young people are getting
computer-related jobs. Money in the campaign war chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``More attention is paid to a flourishing industry,'' said Rep.
Steve Horn, R-Calif., a member of the House Internet Caucus. When
an industry has the power to create thousands of jobs in your
state, ``you've got to stay awake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some say legislators are now so responsive that next year,
companies may have the power to mold the laws that will govern the
wired world of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a wonderful window of opportunity where high-tech is
still being seen in a very positive light,'' said Rick White, a
former congressman from Redmond, Wash. Now a lawyer who advises
high-tech companies, including Dell Computer Corp. and Amazon.com,
White said tech titans are so popular today on the Hill that ``they
probably could get Congress to do anything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Papermaster, who also heads TechNet Texas, the Austin-based
branch of TechNet, said this passion for technology spread through
Washington ``like wildfire over the last 12 to 24 months.''
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Americans who began using the Internet years
ago, Congress may seem a little late to the love affair. But no one
working on Capitol Hill seems surprised that lawmakers were among
the last to appreciate the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has always been slow to come to any new technology,''
said Edward Segal, president of Internetlobby.com, a group
representing users of the Internet. ``Electricity was around for
years before Congress put electric lights in the Capitol.'' Even
now, many lawmakers remain reluctant to send e-mail or update their
Web pages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   White, who was elected to the House in 1994 and served two
terms, said Congress's well-deserved reputation as ``an
old-fashioned institution'' initially turned off the Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs, who tended to be young, politically naive and West
Coast-oriented. ``They were clueless about this process'' of making
laws, White said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Clare Fitzgerald, executive director of the Electronic
Commerce Forum, which lobbies for Internet-based companies, agreed
that the physical and psychological distance between the Hill and
the Valley retarded development of relationships between techies
and legislators. ``It's the nature of the California culture to
ignore Washington if possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1998, the wall of indifference began to erode, especially
on the Washington side. The fantastic growth of America Online Inc.
and Internet-focused companies in Fairfax County, Va., made a
profound impression on the lawmakers and staffers who lived nearby,
and wished they could see such job growth to their own districts.
``The Northern Virginia phenomenon has had a big impact'' on
Congress, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators suddenly wanted to meet the wizards who created such
wealth. ``I can get a high-tech CEO in anywhere'' to meet with a
member of Congress, Fitzgerald said. ``I certainly never saw
anything like this when I was working for the banking industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Congress was waking up to the New Economy, entrepreneurs
in the high-tech breeding grounds of Texas, California, Washington,
Massachusetts, Georgia, Colorado and elsewhere were starting to
develop a new appreciation for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   They realized they had problems that Congress could help them
solve.
</P>
<P>
   Shortages of engineers and programmers spurred companies to seek
higher immigration ceilings for highly skilled workers. Companies
focused on electronic commerce began worrying that state and local
governments would impose a patchwork of taxes on Internet
transactions. Federal restrictions on exports of certain
technologies were hurting business.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the example of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft started going through a highly publicized
antitrust case brought by the Justice Department, tech executives
realized Washington could reshape an industry with century-old
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies would look at Microsoft and think, 'That could
happen to me,'' White said. Suddenly, executives knew ``they had to
do a better job of making their case to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, tech companies have been hiring lobbyists
at a furious pace and organizing political networks to make
themselves heard. In fact, the lobbyist buildup is happening so
fast, numbers are hard to nail down.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics, a non-profit research group,
says public documents show spending on lobbying by computer
equipment and services companies shot from $25 million in 1997 to
$39 million in 1998. The 1999 figures are expected to show another
sharp increase in spending.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this ramping up, the high-tech world doesn't yet have a
clear, coordinated lobbying agenda. Indeed, many big, tech-driven
companies, such as Microsoft, AOL and AT&AMP;T, often want very
different things out of Washington. Still, some legislative goals
seem nearly universally supported.
</P>
<P>
   Companies want Congress to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep Internet transactions from being suffocated by a crazy
quilt of state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bolster spending on scientific research and development.
</P>
<P>
   _ Approve electronic signatures to facilitate commerce on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase funding for education.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow more hiring of highly skilled immigrants and boost
exports of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said high-tech companies have an opportunity to push
this agenda in 2000 because most members of Congress are willing to
take advice from entrepreneurs. ``You can count on two hands all of
the people (in Congress) who really understand the high-tech
world,'' she said. ``But you're at a stage that won't last that
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, lawmakers will ``hire the right staffers to close the
information gap,'' she said. Once they feel more confident about
the substance of a debate, legislators may become more argumentive
and less willing to do whatever the high-tech titans tell them to
do. Once that happens, lobbyists may find ``the door will be
closing,'' she said.

   &UR; STAGES: Oiling the Gears for the Body's Clock &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Older people may find it hard to miss that they are the targets
of yet another aggressive advertising campaign, this one for
products containing melatonin.
</P>
<P>
   The hormone, produced by the pineal gland, has shown signs of
helping with a number of problems. A possible sleep inducer that
seems able to reset the biological clock, it has been used to
combat jet lag and some forms of insomnia.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, many companies have begun urging older people to begin
taking melatonin regularly to compensate for the supposed decline
of the hormone as people age. The products are widely available at
health food stores, and, since they are considered a nutritional
supplement (because they can naturally occur in some foods), are
not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether melatonin really does decline with aging,
and a new study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health
concludes that melatonin levels remain fairly stable in healthy
older adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be replacing something, you ought to find
out that it's missing first,'' said Dr. Charles A. Czeisler, the
Harvard researcher who led the study. He has criticized the FDA for
the absence of regulations governing melatonin sales.
</P>
<P>
   Although melatonin levels are often lower in older people,
Czeisler said, the cause it not aging itself, but many of the
ailments that can accompany it. When researchers examined healthy
people ages 65 to 81, they found little difference between their
nighttime melatonin levels and those of people ages 18 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say regular use of melatonin can have wide, if still not
understood, effects on the body, and may prove harmful.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEHAVIOR: For Youth, Silence in a Cloud of Smoke &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston were
dismayed to learn in a new study that few American doctors counsel
young patients about the dangers of smoking. In fact, the study
found, the number of doctors who do so actually seems to be on the
decline, even though most people who start smoking do so when
they're teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers, who presented their findings in The Journal of
the American Cancer Institute, based their conclusions on data from
National Ambulatory Care Surveys of more than 5,000 doctors across
the country from 1991 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said that 72 percent of the time they asked patients
ages 11 to 21 whether they smoked. But at only 1.7 percent of the
visits did they counsel their patients about smoking, less often
than they counsel adult patients. ``We were surprised at how low it
is,'' said Dr. Anne N. Thorndike, the internist who led the study.
``We thought it was going to be low, but not that low.''
</P>
<P>
   Thorndike theorized that one reason doctors did not counsel
young patients against smoking was a lack of time over all.
``Counseling is not reimbursed,'' she said. ``You can't bill for
counseling about smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE LAB: A Case for Some Well-Toned Tissue &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Working to develop engineered tissue that may one day be used to
repair or replace damaged human body parts or organs, researchers
at the University of Michigan came face to face with a problem: the
tissue from the lab was not as strong as that made by the body.
</P>
<P>
   Then they hit on the same idea that gets millions of flabby
people to drag themselves to the gym several times a week:
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists found that if they repeatedly applied stress to the
tissue as it was developing, it grew stronger, not unlike the
muscles-building process in someone who lifts weights.
</P>
<P>
   The work was described in a recent issue of the journal Nature
Biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Mooney said the idea was not that novel. The real
trick, he said, was developing the synthetic polymer framework to
which the tissue cells were attached as they were strengthened.
</P>
<P>
   To date, engineered tissue is used on humans only in procedures
involving skin. Mooney, an associate professor of dentistry and
engineering, said he believed such tissue would be used for
structural repairs, like replacing ligaments, within 5 or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SYMPTOMS: When Fire Consumes a Sense of Smell &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, doctors at the Smell and Taste Treatment and
Research Foundation noticed something odd: within a two-month
period, six firefighters came in for treatment and were found to
have lost the sense of smell.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation, concerned that there could be a much larger
problem, conducted a study of 102 Chicago firefighters and found
that almost half had lost most or all of their ability to smell,
despite their use of breathing masks during fires. The researchers,
who are presenting their findings to the American Public Health
Association's annual meeting this week, say they wonder if there
could be a hidden medical problem of serious dimensions among
America's estimated one million firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   How could a problem potentially this widespread go overlooked
for so long? One reason, said Dr. Alan R. Hirsch, the foundation's
director of neurology, is that the loss of the sense of smell
seemed to come gradually, and so was simply not noticed by many of
the firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-seven percent of those found to have serious losses said
they considered their sense of smell normal _ despite their
inability to distinguish between odors like natural gas and
perfume, or smoke and bubble gum.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the hazards that loss of smell pose to firefighters
on the job, where they need to help detect potentially dangerous
situations, the deficiency has also been linked to other health
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers do not know if the firefighters are being hurt by
the heat or by certain types of fires. They speculate that the
sensors in the nose may be damaged after fires are contained and
many firefighters take off their masks, even though charred
materials may still be sending dangerous chemicals into the air.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; REMEDIES: Of Spouses, Sex, Sleep and Snoring &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If there were ever any doubts that there are a lot of snorers
out there, and an equal number of long-suffering spouses, a new
study puts them to rest.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so it was not really a study. Nor, for that matter, was it
peer-reviewed in a prestigious medical journal or conducted at a
top university with double-blind controls. It was really just a
reaction to a study, but telling, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Some weeks back, news went out about a Mayo Clinic study that
looked at how much sleep was lost by people whose partners _
usually men _ had the severe snoring caused by obstructive sleep
apnea, a serious health condition. Researchers put the loss at
about an hour a night.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that the snoring could be greatly eased
when patients used an oxygen-masklike device providing what is
called continuous positive airway pressure. Dr. John W. Shepard
Jr., who conducted the study, said he was contacted by people
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It seems safe to predict that a new study from the National
Naval Medical Center is hardly likely to dampen interest. The new
study found that when snorers used a mask, they and their spouses
reported better sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   People's questions boiled down to this: Where can I get one of
those masks? But people with serious snoring problems need to
consult their doctors, who can refer them to sleep disorder
specialists, pulmonologists or others who can provide the machines,
which can cost as much as $1,200, but are covered by most insurance
plans for a sleep apnea diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   The machines are not new, and although they have a good track
record, not everyone loves them. They can be encumbering, and one
woman wrote that the one her husband used helped his snoring, but
kept her awake with its hissing (a sign that it was not working
properly, Dr. Shepard said). ``I have now resigned myself to a life
of sleep deprivation,'' she wrote, although she thinks she has hit
on a solution: building herself a room over the garage.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At this year's international bike show, manufacturers introduced
new bikes made of ultralight aerospace materials like titanium,
aluminum and other metals. Many come equipped with front-suspension
forks, rear suspension, hydraulic disc brakes and 27 gears.
</P>
<P>
   These high-end road and mountain rigs with all the bells and
whistles can cost $1,000 to more than $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   As a backlash to all the technology, bike manufacturers like
Bianchi and Voodoo are bringing back one-geared bikes that resemble
those of generations past.
</P>
<P>
   These bikes, called single-speeds, are simpler versions of the
traditional mountain or road bike. While the frames are made out of
the lightweight metals used in geared bikes, the single-speeds lack
the extra chain rings, front and rear detailers, derailleur cables,
shift levers and multiple cogs on the rear wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Without all the fancy extras, the single-speeds are lighter,
cost well under $1,000 and require little maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest appeal of these bikes is that you can just enjoy
the ride,'' said Sky Yaeger, the designer of Bianchi's BUSS, a
single-speed mountain bike. ``You don't have to worry about what
gear you're in, how poorly your bike just shifted, or whether or
not your suspension is working.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Yaeger said that most who ride these bikes describe the
experience as pure, like riding the bikes of their childhood. The
manufacturers would not disclose their sales figures, but said the
bikes had sold out their limited runs.
</P>
<P>
   Single-speed mountain bikes are strong enough to be ridden on
any terrain, but the rider has to do considerably more work,
especially on hills, since there are no gears to make pedaling
easier. Still, some single-speed riders are proficient enough to
keep up with riders on geared bikes.
</P>
<P>
   In Northern California and some areas of the Midwest and
Northeast, many mountain bike races offer a separate single-speed
category. On May 13, the Single-Speed World Championships will be
held in Minneapolis. In keeping with the event's brief tradition _
the race started only last year _ the overall male and female
winner will be awarded not medals or trophies, but tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   Single-speed racing is not about winning or losing, said Gene
Oberpriller, 37, who helps organize the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to have more fun cycling and not make it as
intense as mountain biking has become. Our motto is ``Less gears,
more beers,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity and lightness of one-geared bikes makes them
better for commuting or cruising to the local coffee shop, fans
say. Fivos Andonopoulous, 37, has been converting bikes into
single-speeds for 10 years and commutes 30 miles each way between
his home in the Chicago suburbs to his job at the Chicago Board of
Trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The snow and salt on the roads in Chicago used to ruin my
geared bikes,'' Andonopoulous said. ``But I never have any problems
with my single-speed bikes. I just have to lube the chain once in a
while and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   Serious road cyclists and mountain bikers are turning to
single-speeds as a training aid because, they say, the bikes help
improve fitness, efficiency, pedal stroke and bike handling skills.
Chris Carmichael, who coaches Lance Armstrong, the Tour de France
champion, and was named the United States Olympic Committee's 1999
Coach of the Year, recommends single-speed riding for all of his
cyclists during the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Carmichael recommends training on a variant of the single-speed
road bike, a track, or fixed-gear bike. Such bikes do not allow
coasting, so the only way to rest is to pedal slower. In addition,
most fixed-gear bikes lack brakes, so the only way to stop is to
pedal slower and apply pressure backward to the pedals until the
rear wheel stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because your legs are constantly in motion, this type of
riding provides much more aerobic benefit than geared-bike
riding,'' Carmichael said. ``An hour and a half to two hours of
fixed-gear riding is equivalent to four hours of regular riding.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyclists who want to experience single-speed riding without
paying for a new bike can get their geared bikes converted. A
mechanic installs a $40 part called a singulator that replaces the
rear derailleur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten a lot of requests over the past year to convert
geared bikes into single-speeds,'' said Allen Schulmann of Sid's
Bike Shop in New York City. ``Virtually any bike _ road, mountain
or hybrid _ can be converted into a single-speed.''

 &HT;    CONGRESS'S DOORS OPEN TO WELL-HEELED TECH LOBBY
 &HT;    With TECH-DATA. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Nov. 14.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With registered lobbyists now outnumbering members
of Congress roughly 40 to one, most of the men and women who get
paid to influence legislation are having a tough time arranging
meetings with powerful lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But for those lucky lobbyists who represent high-flying
high-tech companies generating enormous fortunes, the doors on
Capitol Hill are swinging open and the phone lines are free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress is absolutely overwhelmingly interested in working
with us,'' said Steve Papermaster, an Austin, Texas, entrepreneur
and member of the executive council of Technology Network
(TechNet), a political action group founded two years ago in the
Silicon Valley. ``They are opening their doors. In fact, they are
calling us.''
</P>
<P>
   With politicians now so enamored, bills favorable to technology
companies have been speeding through an otherwise listless
Congress. In just little more than the past year, the
Republican-led Congress and Democratic White House have agreed to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Impose a three-year moratorium on taxes on electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase the number of visas issued to highly skilled
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   _ Limit lawsuits against companies involved with Y2K-related
software flaws.
</P>
<P>
   _ Extend copyright protections to material published on the
World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, most members of Congress still thought the Web
was something you took care of by swiping a broom in the corner.
This year, committee hearings lavished attention on the issues of
Internet privacy, encryption, e-mail marketing and more.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists and lawmakers alike say the dramatic change was caused
by one thing: money. Big piles of money on Wall Street. Money back
in the home districts where young people are getting
computer-related jobs. Money in the campaign war chests.
</P>
<P>
   ``More attention is paid to a flourishing industry,'' said Rep.
Steve Horn, R-Calif., a member of the House Internet Caucus. When
an industry has the power to create thousands of jobs in your
state, ``you've got to stay awake,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some say legislators are now so responsive that next year,
companies may have the power to mold the laws that will govern the
wired world of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a wonderful window of opportunity where high-tech is
still being seen in a very positive light,'' said Rick White, a
former congressman from Redmond, Wash. Now a lawyer who advises
high-tech companies, including Dell Computer Corp. and Amazon.com,
White said tech titans are so popular today on the Hill that ``they
probably could get Congress to do anything they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Papermaster, who also heads TechNet Texas, the Austin-based
branch of TechNet, said this passion for technology spread through
Washington ``like wildfire over the last 12 to 24 months.''
</P>
<P>
   For millions of Americans who began using the Internet years
ago, Congress may seem a little late to the love affair. But no one
working on Capitol Hill seems surprised that lawmakers were among
the last to appreciate the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has always been slow to come to any new technology,''
said Edward Segal, president of Internetlobby.com, a group
representing users of the Internet. ``Electricity was around for
years before Congress put electric lights in the Capitol.'' Even
now, many lawmakers remain reluctant to send e-mail or update their
Web pages, he said.
</P>
<P>
   White, who was elected to the House in 1994 and served two
terms, said Congress's well-deserved reputation as ``an
old-fashioned institution'' initially turned off the Silicon Valley
entrepreneurs, who tended to be young, politically naive and West
Coast-oriented. ``They were clueless about this process'' of making
laws, White said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Clare Fitzgerald, executive director of the Electronic
Commerce Forum, which lobbies for Internet-based companies, agreed
that the physical and psychological distance between the Hill and
the Valley retarded development of relationships between techies
and legislators. ``It's the nature of the California culture to
ignore Washington if possible,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1998, the wall of indifference began to erode, especially
on the Washington side. The fantastic growth of America Online Inc.
and Internet-focused companies in Fairfax County, Va., made a
profound impression on the lawmakers and staffers who lived nearby,
and wished they could see such job growth to their own districts.
``The Northern Virginia phenomenon has had a big impact'' on
Congress, Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators suddenly wanted to meet the wizards who created such
wealth. ``I can get a high-tech CEO in anywhere'' to meet with a
member of Congress, Fitzgerald said. ``I certainly never saw
anything like this when I was working for the banking industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Congress was waking up to the New Economy, entrepreneurs
in the high-tech breeding grounds of Texas, California, Washington,
Massachusetts, Georgia, Colorado and elsewhere were starting to
develop a new appreciation for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   They realized they had problems that Congress could help them
solve.
</P>
<P>
   Shortages of engineers and programmers spurred companies to seek
higher immigration ceilings for highly skilled workers. Companies
focused on electronic commerce began worrying that state and local
governments would impose a patchwork of taxes on Internet
transactions. Federal restrictions on exports of certain
technologies were hurting business.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the example of Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   When Microsoft started going through a highly publicized
antitrust case brought by the Justice Department, tech executives
realized Washington could reshape an industry with century-old
laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other companies would look at Microsoft and think, 'That could
happen to me,'' White said. Suddenly, executives knew ``they had to
do a better job of making their case to the government.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, tech companies have been hiring lobbyists
at a furious pace and organizing political networks to make
themselves heard. In fact, the lobbyist buildup is happening so
fast, numbers are hard to nail down.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Responsive Politics, a non-profit research group,
says public documents show spending on lobbying by computer
equipment and services companies shot from $25 million in 1997 to
$39 million in 1998. The 1999 figures are expected to show another
sharp increase in spending.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this ramping up, the high-tech world doesn't yet have a
clear, coordinated lobbying agenda. Indeed, many big, tech-driven
companies, such as Microsoft, AOL and AT&AMP;T, often want very
different things out of Washington. Still, some legislative goals
seem nearly universally supported.
</P>
<P>
   Companies want Congress to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep Internet transactions from being suffocated by a crazy
quilt of state and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bolster spending on scientific research and development.
</P>
<P>
   _ Approve electronic signatures to facilitate commerce on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Increase funding for education.
</P>
<P>
   _ Allow more hiring of highly skilled immigrants and boost
exports of technology.
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald said high-tech companies have an opportunity to push
this agenda in 2000 because most members of Congress are willing to
take advice from entrepreneurs. ``You can count on two hands all of
the people (in Congress) who really understand the high-tech
world,'' she said. ``But you're at a stage that won't last that
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon, lawmakers will ``hire the right staffers to close the
information gap,'' she said. Once they feel more confident about
the substance of a debate, legislators may become more argumentive
and less willing to do whatever the high-tech titans tell them to
do. Once that happens, lobbyists may find ``the door will be
closing,'' she said.

PERSONAL HEALTH: DRUGS, SAFE AND NOT SO SAFE, IN PREGNANCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (First of 2 articles on staying healthy and fit through pregnancy) 
 (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The thalidomide tragedy of the 1960s touched off intense concern
and a vast amount of research about the safety of drugs taken
during pregnancy. Many drugs (and druglike substances, including
coffee, alcohol and tobacco) were tested in laboratory animals or
studied in pregnant women. Some were found to be potential hazards
to developing fetuses, usually only at the beginning of pregnancy
but in some cases only near the time of birth and in others
throughout gestation.
</P>
<P>
   Now most pregnant women are cautioned to avoid any and all
medications that are not absolutely essential, as well as
``pleasure drugs'' like alcohol and tobacco and sometimes coffee
and caffeine. But while this is sound advice in general, it can
often result in needless discomfort for women who avoid taking a
harmless drug that could help them. It also causes undue anxiety
among those women who must take medication or who inadvertently
took one or more drugs before they knew they were pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1968, for example, I got the Hong Kong flu the day I
was expecting the start of menses. Frequent doses of aspirin kept
me from burning up, but 10 days later I remained seriously ill and
still had not gotten my period. Now I was coughing so hard I
cracked a rib. This time the diagnosis was double pneumonia, for
which antibiotics and codeine cough medicine were prescribed. Two
weeks later, my gynecologist informed me that I was pregnant. When
I asked the doctor about the harm that might have been done by the
drugs I had taken, he replied reassuringly, ``If you had not taken
them and had died of pneumonia, you would not be having any baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, I spent the next eight months fretting about the harm
that might have resulted to my unborn child. But by what seemed at
the time to be a miracle, 36 weeks after contracting the flu I gave
birth to perfectly healthy, full-term identical twin boys.
</P>
<P>
   I have since learned that it is reasonably safe for pregnant
women to take a number of drugs in common use, though they should
consult their doctors before taking any drug. Even some vaccines,
including the flu vaccine, are safe to administer to pregnant
women. Furthermore, most medications pose no hazard to a nursing
infant because the amount that gets into breast milk is usually too
small to have a noticeable effect on the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with a general recommendation from Dr. Jennifer R.
Niebyl, head of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa
College of Medicine, who says, ``Pregnant women should be
discouraged from using over-the-counter drugs for trivial
indications.'' Thus, a common cold is best treated with rest,
fluids, a humidifier and, if needed, a saltwater (saline) nasal
spray like Ocean. Topical medications, like a decongestant nasal
spray, are safer than oral ones, and if any cold remedy is used,
combination drugs are best avoided. Cough remedies containing
iodide should be avoided because they may cause a large goiter in
an unborn child.
</P>
<P>
   For aches and pains, try local applications of heat and rest.
But if, say, you have a headache you can't shake and it's
interfering with your life, acetaminophen (like Tylenol) is safer
than aspirin near the end of pregnancy because it does not prolong
bleeding and is not toxic to newborns.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of vaginal yeast infections, a common problem
among pregnant women, antibiotics should be used only when needed
to control a known bacterial infection. Safe antibiotics include
penicillin and its derivatives, erythromycin and the
cephalosporins. On the other hand, sulfonamides are best avoided in
the third trimester, and tetracyclines, which cause discoloration
of babies' teeth, should not be used beyond 25 weeks of gestation.
</P>
<P>
   The drug metronidazole, commonly used to treat intestinal
parasites, is best avoided in the first trimester. Lindane (as in
Kwell), formerly widely used to treat lice infestations, should be
avoided entirely during pregnancy, and pregnant women should wear
rubber gloves when treating children for head lice; safer
alternatives are the pyrethroids with piperonyl butoxide (Rid and
R&AMP;C, for example) or a fine-toothed comb.
</P>
<P>
   The new nonsedating antihistamines used to treat allergies have
not been tested for safety in pregnancy. But women who have been
receiving desensitization shots can continue to do so at a
maintenance dose during pregnancy. Women with asthma can safely use
theophylline, aminophylline, terbutaline and cromolyn sodium. And
it may surprise you to learn that the potent immune-suppressing
drugs prednisone and prednisolone are considered drugs of choice
during pregnancy because they are nearly completely inactivated by
the placenta.
</P>
<P>
   Also safe are alphamethyldopa and propranolol to treat chronic
hypertension. For women plagued by heartburn, antacids are safe for
use in any trimester, but bicarbonate of soda, magnesium
trisilicate and the new H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors are
potentially toxic to the fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Reports on the safety of the new antidepressants called
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI.'s) have been mixed.
One large study of Prozac found no increase in miscarriage or major
birth defects, but infants exposed in the womb were more likely to
have minor defects. The latest report, based on 524 pregnancies,
half of which involved the use of an SSRI, found no increase in
major malformations, miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth
associated with the either the SSRI's or tricyclic antidepressant
drugs taken in recommended doses during pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Although most medications taken in normal doses by a nursing
mother are safe for infants, a few are definitely too toxic for a
baby. These include chemotherapy drugs to treat cancer; lithium to
treat bipolar disorder and drugs like cyclosporine that suppress
the immune system. Even when taking a safe drug, a nursing mother
would be wise to coordinate the dosages with the baby's schedule,
just after the baby has been fed or before the baby's longest
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   For more information about the safety of over-the-counter drugs
during pregnancy, see ``I'm Pregnant and I Have a Cold'' by Dr.
Craig V. Towers, a perinatologist in California at Long Beach
Memorial Medical Center, just published by RBC Press ($27.95 in
hardcover, $14.95 in paperback). Other Substances of Concern
</P>
<P>
   Barbara K. Hackley, a nurse midwife at the Yale School of
Nursing, recently reviewed the safety of immunizations during
pregnancy in The Journal of Nurse-Midwifery. She approves of the
toxoid and inactivated vaccines _ tetanus, diphtheria, hepatitis B,
influenza and pneumococcal vaccines _ although she advises that
even these vaccines are best given in the second and third
trimesters in case they may have some effect yet unrecognized on a
young fetus. Flu vaccine (taken each fall to include the latest
strains) is now recommended for all pregnant women. To be avoided
are live virus and bacterial vaccines, including those for measles,
mumps, rubella and chicken pox.
</P>
<P>
   Legal recreational drugs like alcohol, nicotine and caffeine are
also common concerns among pregnant women. Cigarette smoking during
pregnancy can compromise fetal growth, resulting in babies that are
smaller than they should be at birth, and may also cause
long-lasting intellectual deficits. Heavy consumption of alcohol
during pregnancy causes fetal alcohol syndrome marked by subnormal
growth, muscle and heart damage, and low intelligence or mental
retardation. Although an occasional drink is highly unlikely to
have any adverse effect on a developing fetus, the Food and Drug
Administration advises pregnant women to refrain from drinking any
alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Caffeine and coffee, on the other hand, have been pretty much
cleared of earlier suspicions of fetal harm, at least when consumed
in moderation: no more than three cups of coffee a day. In 1980,
after reports of birth defects in mice induced by caffeine, the FDA
warned pregnant women to limit their intake of coffee. But
considerable evidence accumulated since has not implicated coffee
as a cause of birth defects in humans. Still, there is some
evidence that consuming more than three cups of coffee a day may
slightly reduce birth weights.

CRIMINAL APPEALS RACES SLOWLY TAKING SHAPE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Most races for the Texas Court of Criminal
Appeals are only slightly more exciting than watching paint dry,
and next year's campaigns may be no exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But two races will probably generate more than passing interest,
at least among the small group of people who pay any attention to
the court, namely prosecutors, criminal defense lawyers, crime
victims' advocates and other judges.
</P>
<P>
   One race will be Judge Steve Mansfield's re-election attempt,
the first time he will have been on the ballot _ if he doesn't
change his mind again _ since his surprise election in a 1994
Republican landslide. The other will be a potentially divisive
fight between two incumbent court members for the presiding judge's
post to be vacated by Mike McCormick.
</P>
<P>
   Both races are shaping up in the Republican primary, which has
produced all the recent winners of statewide offices in Texas.
Democrats may yet try to compete, but all the early candidates are
Republicans, as are all the members of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield, who first said he wasn't going to seek a second term
and then said he was, is attracting several potential GOP
opponents, who hope that his periodic controversies will finally
catch up with him.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had little criminal law experience before joining
the court and his election was considered a fluke, Mansfield has
developed a reputation as a hard worker, and his mostly hard-line
record against criminal defendants reflects the majority viewpoint
on the court. But trouble still follows him.
</P>
<P>
   Just last month, he pleaded no contest to a trespassing charge
stemming from his arrest by University of Texas police last year
for allegedly trying to scalp his complimentary tickets to a UT
football game. He was given six months' probation.
</P>
<P>
   The Mansfield controversy five years ago overshadowed a
significant judicial milestone, the election of the first woman,
Sharon Keller, a former Dallas County prosecutor, to the Court of
Criminal Appeals. Now, McCormick's pending retirement gives Keller
the opportunity to mark another milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Keller plans to run for the presiding judge's post rather than
seek re-election to her own seat, which also comes before the
voters next year. If she is successful, she also would become the
first woman to preside over the court, although she said that
distinction wasn't the reason she was running.
</P>
<P>
   But Keller faces opposition from Judge Tom Price, another member
of the court, who also intends to run for presiding judge. Price
has the advantage of being in the middle of a term, which means he
will remain on the court if he loses his race. For Keller, it will
be up or out.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick has given Keller a taste for the presiding judge's
administrative duties by appointing her to various committees and
task forces that have broadened her experience and raised her
profile during her first-ever term as a judge.
</P>
<P>
   Keller also is strongly in the prosecutors' corner, while Price
is sometimes part of a minority that has been known to side with
criminal appellants.
</P>
<P>
   Price is a more experienced judge, but his first 22 years on the
bench were as a trial judge in Dallas. He had no appellate court
experience until he was elected to the Court of Criminal Appeals
three years ago. And he has been mostly absent from Austin since
joining the high court.
</P>
<P>
   Price attends most of the court's weekly conferences _ where he
sits next to Keller _ and attends oral arguments, held once or
twice a month. But he spends the rest of the time in Dallas, away
from the chambers where his colleagues and their staffs research
and write the court's opinions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't shown a lot of interest in the court,'' Keller said,
signaling a possible campaign issue. She questioned whether Price
even knew all the presiding judge's responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Price acknowledged that he spent most of the work week in
Dallas, but he said he had to take care of his elderly father and,
as a single parent, his teen-age son. But he said he takes work
home with him and has documents faxed and shipped by bus. He
promised to work full time in Austin if elected presiding judge.
</P>
<P>
   Price said he was presiding judge of Dallas County's 15 criminal
district courts for six years and oversaw the probation department
and dealt with county commissioners on budgetary matters. He said
he was ``good at getting people to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their best efforts, the candidates' qualities will
probably be lost to most voters in a low-profile race.
</P>
<P>
   Women have done well in judicial races in the Republican primary
in recent years. And Price may still have strong name
identification in Dallas. But John Bradley, a Williamson County
prosecutor who lost a race to Price three years ago, said a
campaign for the court is still a ``complete gamble.''

<P>
   When Neiko Fischbein watched television she got ``overcranked.''
No matter what, she could not sit still. ``She just seemed to be
attracted, or distracted, by everything in constant fashion,'' said
Dr. Ellen Fischbein, a psychiatrist who lives outside of New Haven.
``I'm kind of a high-energy person, but she exhausted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting attention deficit disorder, Dr. Fischbein took her
3{-year-old to see a behavior specialist, who concurred and
prescribed Dexedrine. Within two days, Dr. Fischbein had witnessed
a complete transformation in Neiko: ``It was like somebody had
virtually turned a dial.''
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, Neiko Fischbein is a Rottweiler.
</P>
<P>
   And just like humans, they sometimes need psychiatric help. Dr.
Nicholas Dodman, who prescribed Neiko's Dexedrine, is a leader in
the small but growing field of animal psychology, where many of the
current controversies echo eerily similar debates in the field of
human behavior. And while psychologists have drawn lessons from
animals since Pavlov's experiments a century ago, insights now are
flowing in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   The American Veterinary Medicine Association began to recognize
animal behavior as a board-certified specialty in 1993, and since
then, only 20 veterinarians, including Dodman, have earned the
certification. An animal behavior specialist at Tufts University,
Dodman is a co-author of the only veterinary textbook on the use of
psychopharmaceuticals in animals and has written several popular
books on behavior, including ``Dogs Behaving Badly'' (Bantam, 1999)
and ``The Cat Who Cried for Help'' (Bantam, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   But many others are hanging out shingles, from PhDs in
psychology to dog trainers, and they charge up to $250 as hour,
with telephone follow-ups). Other signs of the field's growth
abound. In January, the Food and Drug Administration officially
approved the use of two human psychopharmaceuticals, Clomicalm and
Anipryl, for mental problems in dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, which makes Clomicalm, an anti-anxiety drug, expects
it to produce $25 million a year in animal sales.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 29 veterinary schools in the United States now
offer residency programs in animal behavior. The Tufts University
Veterinary Center has started a fax-back service for pet owners who
cannot wait the three months to see Dodman.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in human psychology, many diagnoses and treatments are
controversial. Ian Dunbar, a psychologist and puppy training expert
in Berkeley, Calif., says that when he asks an owner about a dog's
annoying behaviors, he expects to hear about problems like chewing,
barking or escaping. But more and more, he said, ``people have
developed big names for mythical syndromes: things like separation
anxiety syndrome.'' He added: ``I just disagree with that. Dogs are
dogs and they do doggy things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar, who believes in positive-reinforcement, for dogs and
children, takes umbrage at the idea of ``separation anxiety'' in
pets. He argues that dogs that chew or bark or otherwise behave
badly when their owners leave are usually just cutting loose. ``The
dog learns it's simply bad news to act like a dog when the owners
are around,'' he said. Rather than getting a psychoactive drug, he
argues, pets need reward-based training in how to deal with
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   David Falk, an Airedale trainer based in Corinth, N.Y., agrees
that ``separation anxiety'' is just a word for boredom. ``They're
bored,'' he said. ``They tear your house apart. Are they bored
because you're gone? Or are they bored because they're bored?''
</P>
<P>
   Animal behavior specialists will probably always have to wrestle
with the accusation that they attributing human traits to animals.
But Dodman points out that sometimes a human diagnosis is as
controversial as a canine one; when it comes to attention deficit
disorder, for example, the British ``think Americans are crazy and
are overdosing their children'' with stimulants like Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in animals as in humans, he said, a conspicuous change in
activity level indicates a diagnosable condition. Give the creature
Ritalin or Dexedrine, and if it experiences the paradoxical
response of calming down, as Neiko did, the diagnosis is confirmed,
Dodman said.
</P>

   Trainers are among the most skeptical of assigning human
conditions to pets. Most pet behavior problems, they believe, stem
from either inappropriate human expectations or lack of training.
``A lot of these dogs are hard-wired for specific behaviors,'' said
Kilcommons, co-author of the book ``Paws to Consider'' (Warner
Books, 1999), adding that many owners picked breeds that were
entirely unsuited for their lifestyles. ``They buy a Weimaraner
because it's an attractive, handsome dog,'' he said. ``They don't
do their homework. You have to run this dog, at least two hours a
day of hard running.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Richmond, co-executive director of the Humane Society of
New York, says many dogs are labeled bad because they do not have
the opportunity to run off energy while the owners are at work.
``It would be like telling a 4-year-old to sit at a desk for 10
hours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman agrees that some odd dog behaviors do stem from modern
circumstances. He once had to euthanize a bull terrier named Teddy
when nothing would stop the dog from frantically chasing its tail.
Years later, a colleague pointed out that bull terriers were bred
as predators, specifically to kill rats.
</P>
<P>
   Many tail chasers, Dodman now believes, are simply pursuing the
``only potential prey'' in their environments. He treats them with
Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   As in human psychology, many problems can be alleviated through
a combination of retraining and psychopharmacology. Take
thunderstorm phobia, a common canine fear. Dr. Peter Borchelt, a
pet behavior expert in Brooklyn, N.Y., who has a PhD in psychology,
uses thunderstorm recordings and strobe lights to desensitize
fearful pets. When that fails, he may recommend anti-anxiety
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lessons that can be learned from pet psychology are
what makes good parents. ``That's the real importance of all this
puppy stuff,'' Dunbar said. ``There are three species in the world
which are regularly abused: dogs, horses and humans.'' Dr. Beaver
says that while many of the links between animal and human
psychology are speculative, this much is certain: ``People who are
physically abusive of animals have a high probability of physical
abuse to people.'' In some jurisdictions, animal-abuse authorities
share information with child-abuse agencies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite obvious connections between animals and humans in terms
of brain chemistry and behavior modification, there are areas of
human psychology where pets will probably never tread. Do not
expect Fido or Whiskers to be sharing their dreams anytime soon _
even though Dobermans are used by sleep researchers at Stanford to
study narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dr. Beaver does not think animal behaviorists are years
behind their human counterparts, she does concede that she and her
colleagues must sometimes draw on insights from human psychology.
``Because,'' she explained, ``we can't talk to our clients.''

ALERT SYSTEM HAS BEEN CREDITED WITH SAFE RECOVERY OF 5 ABDUCTED
CHILDREN 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The infant had been missing for about an hour
_ abducted by her baby sitter _ when the police department received
a 911 call from an excited motorist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your emergency?'' the operator asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Amber Alert,'' the caller said over his cell phone. ``The
lady's right in front of me. She's got a baby sitting in front of
her and I saw it and heard that (alert). I said, `Man, that's her.
I can't believe it.'``
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, police stopped the car, rescued the child and
arrested the baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the more dramatic moments in a 3-year-old program
designed to locate abducted children quickly, and it is one of the
reasons that the Amber Plan _ named for a young girl who was
abducted from her Texas home and killed in 1996  &UR; _ &LR;  has begun to
spread across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma plans to run a statewide test next month and implement
it in January. Two weeks ago, Kansas City completed procedures for
its version of the plan. Houston, Battle Creek, Mich., and cities
throughout California have asked the Arlington Police Department
for help in setting up programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It works,'' says Officer Dee Anderson, a spokesman for the
Arlington police, ``and it doesn't cost anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the plan evolved in 1996, following the kidnapping
and slaying of Amber Hagerman, a crime that shocked the community
and troubled Arlington police.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Amber,'' Anderson says, ``we knew within minutes what we
were dealing with, but we didn't have any way to get the word
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with a group of radio stations, the police department
came up with a scheme to get the word out quickly and, in effect,
turn the entire Dallas-Fort Worth area into a neighborhood watch.
</P>
<P>
   Once police were convinced a child had been kidnapped, was not a
runaway or in the middle of a custody fight, they alerted every
radio station in the area. The stations were given a description of
the child, the kidnapper and vehicle so the information could be
immediately broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two radio stations agreed to participate by interrupting
their programming for an Amber Alert, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our research told us that 98 percent of the people driving
their cars are listening to the radio,'' he said. ``Getting it on
all the stations is critical. No matter what station you are
listening to, you will get this information.''
</P>
<P>
   However, faxing 32 stations proved to be too time-consuming, so
the system was amended. Now, the police notify two Dallas area
stations, which notify the others through the Emergency Alert
System. In the same way that listeners would be warned of severe
weather, they would now be alerted to a missing child.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 10 television stations &UR;  &LR; agreed to join the radio
stations in broadcasting the alerts.
</P>
<P>
   Since the plan went into operation early in 1997, Anderson says,
it has been activated about two dozen times and is credited with
the safe recovery of at least five abducted children.
</P>
<P>
   One of those was 9-year-old Felicia Moore, who was snatched from
a sidewalk last March while walking with a friend in southeast
Dallas. A man standing beside a pickup delayed them by talking to
them about a kitten. As the friend walked on, the man grabbed
Felicia, forced her into the truck and drove away.
</P>
<P>
   Six hours later, she was found walking beside a rural road about
35 miles from where she was kidnapped. The girl told police the
kidnapper stopped the car suddenly and told her to get out.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said it is believed that the kidnapper heard the Amber
Alert on the radio and, fearing that he would be spotted with the
girl, decided to free her.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the Amber Plan spread across the country after it
was featured on the television show ``America's Most Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says he has cautioned inquiring police agencies that
the Amber Plan has pitfalls and is still going through revisions in
North Texas. The biggest problem, he said, has been an
indiscriminate use of the plan by some of the 33 police agencies
that participate in it in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was being activated too often,'' he says. ``Every time a
child was missing for a short time, the police were pressured to
activate the plan. The radio managers complained and some were
threatening to pull out.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says it is rare for children to be abducted by
strangers. In most cases, they are taken by parents or relatives
and that does not justify an Amber Alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``People started thinking of it as a routine law enforcement
tool,'' Anderson says. ``When an officer showed up at the residence
(of a missing child) the first thing the parents asked was, `Are
you going to activate the Amber Plan?' They wanted it done
immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there are new rules: The plan can be activated only if the
missing child is under age 15 (or has a proven mental or physical
disability) and if the police believe the child is in serious
danger.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Curvy, an aide to Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, said that
state's 200 radio stations were enthusiastic about participating in
a statewide program, even though Oklahoma does not have a large
number of child abductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if there aren't many,'' he said, ``these kinds of cases
stick with you for a while. People here are still talking about the
State Fair murders (two girls disappeared from the fair and have
never been found) and that was in the '70s.''

FORMER HEAD OF NETSCAPE FEELS VINDICATED BY MICROSOFT RULING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jim Barksdale's moment of vindication came this
past Friday while he was sitting in bumper-to- bumper traffic near
the Getty Museum in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   On the phone was one of his public relations executives with
some interesting news for the 56-year-old former president of
Netscape Communications Corp. A federal judge had just ruled that
Microsoft Corp. was a monopoly determined to dominate the computer
industry.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies the judge said Microsoft had savaged was
Mountain View-based Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really didn't sink in,'' said Barksdale in a telephone
interview Sunday. ``It took a few minutes to absorb what had
actually happened.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened was that U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, in his ``findings of fact,'' showed that he believed
Barksdale and others who had testified against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale, a former FedEx and AT&AMP;T executive, was the first
witness called to the stand during a yearlong trial to determine
whether Microsoft had used unfair and predatory practices to gain a
monopoly hold of the market for computer operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's ruling is the first of a multistage determination of
Microsoft's legal liability and punishment, if any, for its
business actions.
</P>
<P>
   According to the judge's ruling, Microsoft targeted Netscape
because it feared that Netscape's browser software, which debuted
in December 1994, would diminish a computer user's need for the
Microsoft Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   A browser lets computer users view and navigate the World Wide
Web. Netscape's software also was letting users surf the Web
independent of the computer operating system. An operating system,
or OS, is the basic software a computer needs to run other
programs. Microsoft's Windows is the OS on 95 percent of the
world's desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wrote that Microsoft, fearing an erosion of its Windows
market, set out to destroy Netscape's market lead by bundling its
rival Internet Explorer browser with the Windows OS. Microsoft also
offered its software free to users.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics, Jackson found, eroded Netscape's market share.
</P>
<P>
   That decline led to the company's sale to America Online earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   With its actions toward Netscape, Jackson wrote, ``Microsoft has
demonstrated that it will use its prodigious market power and
immense profits to harm any firm that insists on pursuing
initiatives that could intensify competition against one of
Microsoft's core products.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to read those words,'' said Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape _ under the leadership of Barksdale, flamboyant tech
entrepreneur Jim Clark and boy computing wonder Marc Andreessen _
had ushered in the Internet age with its browser.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1995, just eight months after the software's
publication, Netscape kicked off a new financial era. Its shares,
priced at $28, peaked at $74.75 during the first day of trading,
pumping the market value of the 16-month-old company to $1 billion.
That launched a stampede of high-flying Internet stocks _ and the
start of the new digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really changed the world with that company,'' said
Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   But Netscape had set a course that would put it squarely in the
path of the Microsoft juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   In late May 1995, according to Jackson's ruling, Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman and chief executive officer _ and the world's
richest man _ sent out a company memo titled ``The Internet Tidal
Wave.'' That memo described Netscape as a new rival ``born'' on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The memo was in direct conflict with Gates' testimony during the
trial, when he claimed he had been unaware of Netscape during that
period.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1995, Microsoft executives met with Barksdale and other
Netscape officials to try to determine if some accord could be
reached that would tie Netscape to Microsoft's Windows and let both
companies rule the emerging Internet world.
</P>
<P>
   That accord was never reached, wrote Jackson, because Microsoft
officials failed to get Netscape to commit to incorporating its
browser into the Windows OS.
</P>
<P>
   Gates _ labeling one executive ``naive'' for believing an accord
could be forged _ cut off negotiations and set out to wreck a
potential competitor by predatory pricing, bundling its own browser
with its Windows OS and requiring computer makers to install
Explorer at the exclusion of the Netscape software, the judge
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Barksdale was accused by Microsoft lawyers of making up details
of those meetings after his testimony in a Washington, D.C.,
courtroom last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Microsoft lawyers said I was making all this up,''
recalled Barksdale. ``But I told them: `I was there, you
weren't.'''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has contended that its Explorer dominance was based on
aggressive, but fair and legal, business tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, however, determined otherwise, saying that Microsoft's
actions ``hobbled'' innovation and were ``harmful'' to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The former Netscape president, who now heads the Barksdale
Group, an investment advisory firm, said he hopes Jackson's ruling
will put to rest a question that's been a favorite at Silicon
Valley cocktail parties: Was Netscape's slide due to misdirection
from company executives, or did the company fall victim to a
voracious monopoly?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vindication of what we've been saying,'' said
Barksdale. ``We did not fumble the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But that vindication doesn't seem to have totally soothed
Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shame what happened to our company,'' said Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``A real shame.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   El Nino and La Nina, the warmer and colder phases of a perpetual
oscillation in the surface temperature of the tropical Pacific
Ocean that drastically affects weather around the world, have in
recent years become familiar agents of short-term climate change.
</P>
<P>
   Now some scientists believe they may have identified a
comparable kind of oscillation involving deep ocean currents. They
say this oscillation could warm and cool substantial parts of the
globe on longer time scales of centuries to millenniums.
</P>
<P>
   The deep ocean currents, in effect, create a global conveyor
belt that transports great amounts of heat around the world. When
the currents run strongly, for example, Western Europe and the
North Atlantic region are relatively warm; when they are weak, they
cool off.
</P>
<P>
   One instance of this cooling, some experts now suspect, was what
is called the little ice age, an intermittent cold spell from the
14th to 19th centuries that at its coldest sent glaciers coursing
down mountain slopes and condemned much of Europe to famine by
freezing harvests.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, researchers at the Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory of Columbia University discovered that cold spells
lasting several centuries, much like the little ice age, have
occurred regularly, about every 1,400 to 1,500 years, since the end
of the last full ice age some 10,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Much bigger temperature swings, they found, occurred at the same
intervals during the ice age itself. They discovered this by
analyzing climate signals contained in ocean sediments in the North
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Now, by putting together different sorts of evidence, other
researchers led by Dr. Wallace S. Broecker, a marine geochemist at
Lamont-Doherty, have postulated that the oscillations in deep-ocean
currents may be responsible for the 1,500-year cold cycles.
</P>
<P>
   The study by Broecker and Stewart Sutherland of Lamont-Doherty
and Tsung-Hung Peng of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration appears in the current issue of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a long way to go before Broecker's postulate can
be proved or disproved, it appeared to provide a possible new
explanation for what Dr. Richard Alley, a climate expert at
Pennsylvania State University, called ``a fundamental beat to the
climate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Broecker had ``put together a very possible story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need good hypotheses,'' Alley said, ``and he's given us
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Discerning and explaining the climate's fundamental beat is
important to a central climate question of the day: whether the
atmosphere is warming because of natural changes or human-induced
changes in the atmosphere, chiefly emissions of heat-trapping waste
industrial gases, like carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
   Broecker is a primary advocate of the concept of the ocean
conveyor belt as a climate regulator. The conveyor is believed to
be driven by changes in the salt content of the ocean's surface.
</P>
<P>
   When salt builds up in a particular spot in the North Atlantic,
it eventually makes the water dense enough to sink to the ocean
depths. Other water rushes in to replace it at the surface. This
combination is what sets the conveyor moving. The bigger and
stronger the main conveyor current, the more heat it can transport.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the North Atlantic, there is one other place where
the conveyor gets a boost from sinking water (scientists call this
production of deep water): the Weddell Sea near Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   By combining the results of a number of recent chemical and
physical studies by several scientists, Broecker has concluded that
the two sites do not produce roughly the same amount of deep water
all the time, as had been thought. Rather, he says, the southern
and northern sites alternate as strong producers: when one is
giving a strong boost to the conveyor, the other is giving a weak
one, with widespread consequences for climate.
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies of past climates have shown that when the
North Atlantic region has been cold, as in the end of the last ice
age, Antarctica has been relatively warm. And a recent study by Dr.
Gary Clow, a geophysicist at the United States Geological Survey in
Denver, based on an analysis of ancient Antarctic ice, suggests
that since the end of the last glaciation, Antarctica was warmer
whenever Europe was colder, as in the little ice age.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, chemical evidence shows that the production of deep
water off Antarctica has slowed to about a third of its rate a
century or so ago, when the little ice age was ending, while
production has remained strong in the North Atlantic. That means
the conveyor belt in that region continues to draw heat from the
south to warm the North Atlantic region, especially Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
   No firm cause-and-effect link has been established between the
conveyor's supposed oscillations and the 1,500-year recurrences of
cold spells like the little ice age. But Broecker says there is a
clear relationship between the conveyor's behavior and climate
oscillations in the last ice age. And he says that if the conveyor
has indeed oscillated since then, as now seems the case, it
suggests that the link may have persisted.
</P>
<P>
   It is, he says, ``consistent with the idea that changes in the
large-scale circulation in the ocean can have very important
effects on the atmosphere,'' and that ``we're playing with a system
that we still don't understand.''

</P>
<P>
   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>

   CHINA-U.S.-TRADE (Washington) _ After a long Saturday-night
telephone call with President Jiang Zemin of China, President
Clinton on Monday sent his trade representative and his top
economic adviser to Beijing in an effort to close a deal that would
get China into World Trade Organization in return for a huge
opening of its market. The speed with which Clinton dispatched
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and Gene Sperling, who
heads the National Economic Council, and who advised Clinton to
walk away from a huge trade deal with China in April, indicated
that the administration now believes that an agreement is within
reach. By David E. Sanger.

   GERMANY-WALL (Berlin) _ Virtually nobody predicted the fall of
the Berlin Wall _ and apparently nobody planned it. As a result,
two German states with divergent ideologies and cultures found
themselves propelled toward union on the panicky reaction of a
border guard who opened the gate at Berlin's Bornholmerstrasse
crossing without an explicit order to do so. Some of the effects of
that precipitation are still evident today. Most fundamentally, a
united Germany is not quite sure of its identity. By Roger Cohen.

   BUSH-ENVIRON (Austin, Texas) _ Early this summer, with political
pressure mounting on him to address his state's abysmal air
pollution problems, Gov. George W. Bush signed a law he regards as
the gold star of his green resume: a program targeting outdated
industrial plants that are among the heaviest polluters in Texas.
For Bush, who began his business career in the oil fields of West
Texas, the program meant confronting the state's oil, gas and
chemical industries that are among his most generous campaign
contributors. With the new law, Bush now boasts that he is the
first Texas governor ``to ever have brought industry together and
said, `Get into compliance.''' But what he actually did was a

migration theory and come to terms with a more complex picture of
earliest American settlement. People may have arrived thousands to
tens of thousands of years sooner, in many waves of migration and
by a number of routes. Their ancestry may not have been only Asian.
Some of the migrations may have originated in Australia or Europe.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the temperature soared past 75 degrees in Indianapolis,
breaking a record that had stood for 120 years. Tuesday, gusty
breezes from the southwest will direct the unseasonable warmth
eastward, setting the stage for additional records from the Ohio
Valley to the Middle Atlantic Coast. Some of the warmest air will
occur across the Middle Atlantic coastal plain as the air mass is
further heated by compression upon descending the Appalachian
mountains. Amid abundant sunshine, daytime readings will climb well
into the 70s from Raleigh, N.C., to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly air will persist across northern New England. Clouds and
spotty light rain or snow showers will form over extreme northern
Maine as a warm front approaches from the southwest. Cooler air
will also arrive across the Northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley behind a weak cool front pressing south through the region.
</P>
<P>
   Ample sun and warm conditions will cover an expansive area from
Texas and the southern Plains to the Southeast States. Patches of
cumulus clouds will obscure the sun at times near the southern
Appalachians as the uneven heating of the undulating terrain
encourages ascending currents of moist air.
</P>
<P>
   Windswept rain will buffet the Northwest Coast on Tuesday as
moist Pacific air is lifted by an approaching cold front. Snow will
fall in the Cascades with snow levels lowering to pass level this
evening. California and the remainder of the Southwest will be
mostly sunny and seasonable, though low clouds will cling to
portions of the Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Duluth's Dearth
</P>
<P>
   Duluth, Minn., at the west end of Lake Superior is known for its
long, cold winters. In fact, much of the downtown is connected by
tunnels and enclosed elevated walkways so residents do not need
bundle up to go across the street in the winter. On Monday, the
mercury rose to a record high of 67 degrees, far above the normal
maximum of 40. Duluth has yet to measure its first snowfall of the
season. In a typical year, the first inch would fall by this
weekend. In 1964, the city had no measurable snow until November
24, the latest ever. The warm spell should end on Wednesday, but no
snow is in sight.

 &HT;    BCS' latest tabulations stir emotions
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bowl Championship Series' ranking has its first big
controversy. Tennessee's 34-14 win over Notre Dame and Virginia
Tech's near-loss to West Virginia on Saturday created the problem.
</P>
<P>
   The once-beaten Volunteers jumped over the undefeated Hokies
into second place in this week's ratings, released Monday. Florida
State (9-0) remained No. 1 by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
   The BCS standings are created by using the traditional polls of
the media and of the coaches, computer polls, won-loss record and
strength of schedule. The result is an overall ranking. The top two
teams in the final standings, released Dec. 5, will play in the
Sugar Bowl on Jan. 4 for the mythical national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Although Monday's rankings stirred emotions in Blacksburg, Va.,
and Knoxville, Tenn., chances are the situation will be different
next week if both teams, separated by .33 of a point, win Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee's strength of schedule is rated No. 9, the Hokies' No.
60. But Virginia Tech, which needed a field goal at the buzzer to
get by West Virginia, hosts Miami on Saturday in Blacksburg, and
Tennessee plays at Arkansas. Miami's schedule is rated the
second-toughest in the nation, so a win should improve Virginia
Tech's schedule enough to move the Hokies back ahead of Tennessee
in next week's standings.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Tech's final two regular-season games are against
Temple and Boston College. Tennessee, the defending national
champion, finishes with Kentucky and Vanderbilt.
</P>
<P>
   Florida is in No. 4 in the new standings, but the Gators have a
great opportunity to move up in the coming weeks. They play South
Carolina on Saturday but finish at home against No. 1 Florida
State. If Florida wins that game and then wins the SEC championship
game against another nationally ranked team, chances are the Gators
could move into one of the top two spots.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State is at No. 5, despite being undefeated. The
Wildcats' strength of schedule is No. 76. Kansas State plays at
Nebraska on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, ranked No. 2 last week, dropped to No. 7 after its
24-23 loss to Minnesota.

<P>
   The approaching Christmas season is a time of celebration, hope
and joy in the birth of the Messiah. But some biblical critics
don't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, they have offered many theories challenging
gospel accounts and the events described in the New Testament. But
now, out of the catacombs of history, comes new information that
will startle skeptics and make the hearts of believers rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Long buried in ancient texts are surprising accounts that will
revolutionize old assumptions that Thomas was the only apostle who
went to India, that the Jews of Jesus' time spoke Aramaic and not
Hebrew, that the four gospels were originally written in Greek and
that Mark's gospel was the first of them.
</P>
<P>
   This newly uncovered information further confirms that Matthew,
an eyewitness to the miracles and events of Jesus' ministry, was
indeed the author of the first gospel and verifies both the
Jewishness and early date of the first gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a clear mention that the Gospel of Matthew was
written in Hebrew -- not Greek or Aramaic, as widely thought -- and
was carried out of Israel by one of the original apostles to the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the earliest church fathers and historians, Eusebius and
Origen, wrote that a second, long-overlooked apostle, Bartholomew,
also went to India and took a gospel text with him, according to
Princeton scholar and author Samuel Moffett.
</P>
<P>
   In his ground-breaking book, ``A History of Christianity in
Asia,'' Moffett reveals that Pantaenus, a church historian and
missionary who traveled to India in 180 A.D., discovered the copy
of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that Bartholomew had taken with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reported,'' wrote Eusebius, a fourth-century bishop and
church historian, ``that among persons there who knew Christ,
(Pantaenus) found the Gospel according to St. Matthew (which had
arrived ahead of Pantaenus by more than a century). For
Bartholomew, one of the apostles, had preached to them and left
them (in India) the writing of Matthew in the Hebrew language which
they had preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shock hidden in that rather matter-of-fact
statement. ... The surprise, of course, is the mention of
Bartholomew as the pioneer to the East,'' Moffett says.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars are unaware of an apostle other than Thomas ever
going to India, and some even doubt that Thomas himself went.
</P>
<P>
   Moffett ponders, ``What was Bartholomew ... doing in India with
a Hebrew Gospel of Matthew?''
</P>
<P>
   Why India?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish colonies are known to have existed in India from very
early times,'' Moffett writes, ``If there were, as tradition
asserts, Hebrew or Aramaic copies of the Gospel in circulation as
early as that, it is not unreasonable to imagine a Jewish
missionary using one in his evangelistic work, for it was the
apostolic missionary tradition to preach first to the Jewish
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, two historical records -- the New Testament's
Book of Acts and the writings of the Church Fathers -- confirm some
of Moffett's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Gospels were so thoroughly Jewish, there was no
concept among Jewish believers of preaching to gentiles. According
to Acts, Jewish believers in Israel were horrified to learn that
Peter entered a gentile home and preached to gentiles. Jews did not
preach to gentiles until the Jewish believers fled from persecution
to the Greek city of Antioch in Asia Minor.
</P>
<P>
   While the Book of Acts lists the 11 apostles -- Judas having
hanged himself -- it doesn't say how they were paired. But what is
known is that Jesus instructed his disciples to work and travel by
twos.
</P>
<P>
   So, it would be natural for Thomas to travel with a companion to
India and for Bartholomew to have taken along a freshly copied text
of Matthew's gospel, especially if it were the first and only
gospel written at the time. Jews customarily took their sacred
texts with them, as we see from the New Testament accounts of
Paul's travels, and it was this Gospel of Matthew that Pantaenus
found a century and a half later in India.
</P>
<P>
   Like many Jews of the early centuries, Pantaenus became a
follower of Jesus. But it is not only Pantaenus' academic
background as philosopher, his founding of the great theological
school in Alexandria and his two renowned disciples, Clement and
Origen, that make him so important here.
</P>
<P>
   As Moffett writes, ``The fact that Pantaenus was ... Jewish ...
explains his particular attention to the Hebrew copy of the Gospel
of Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he returned to Alexandria with the same gospel
adds enormous validity to its discovery.
</P>
<P>
   These discoveries about Bartholomew going to India, the
existence of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that was probably
written before 50 AD and the same text being returned to the West
add ``another piece of evidence of once again very early dating of
the New Testament,'' said Douglas Cecil, associate professor of
pastoral ministries at Dallas Theological Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do we now know where some of the apostles traveled but
also that Hebrew was far from a dead language at the time of
Christ, as many scholars espouse, and it evidently was used by Jews
all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   In search of what language was used during the time of Christ,
we find some interesting clues. Scholar George Howard, in his book,
``The Gospel of Matthew According to a Primitive Hebrew Text,''
quotes an early second-century writing by Papias (ca. 60-130 CE),
bishop of Hierapolis in Asia Minor, as stating that ``Matthew
collected the oracles in the Hebrew language.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard goes on to say, ``It has become commonplace (for the past
century and a half) to suppose that by 'Hebrew,' Papias meant
'Aramaic.' The subsequent discovery of many ... Hebrew documents
from Palestine from the general time period of Jesus now show
Hebrew to have been alive and well in the first century.''
</P>
<P>
   He also writes of a ``remarkable Hebrew text of the Gospel of
Matthew'' that appears in a 14th-century rabbinical text by
Shem-Tob, which Howard says is written ``in a kind of Hebrew one
would expect for a document composed in the first century.'' That
is, before 100 AD. He suggests that this Hebrew text, going back to
the time of Christ, may have ``served as a model for the Greek.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a common scholarly assumption that the original language
of the gospels was Greek. Yet the Church Fathers tell us otherwise.
Irenaeus, in the second century AD., tells us that Matthew was not
the only gospel writer who wrote to the Hebrews ``in their own
dialect.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians Epiphanius and Eusebius, both from the fourth century
AD, tell us that ``Matthew issued his Gospel in Hebrew'' and that
he wrote his Gospel ``in his native language.''
</P>
<P>
   A Dallas Theological Seminary professor of New Testament,
Darrell Bock, said that according to the tradition of the early
church, the language Jesus originally spoke ``was a Semitic
language.''
</P>
<P>
   William Farmer, a New Testament professor at University of
Dallas and author of the just-published book, ``Anti-Judaism and
the Gospels,'' sees a concerted effort by modern scholars to
divorce Jesus from his Jewish roots and language.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unconscious attempt to remove Judaism from
Christianity by making Mark the first gospel instead of Matthew,
which is more Jewish. By making Mark the first gospel, it
discredits Matthew as only a Jewish makeover of Mark and thus
offers an excuse to disregard Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, some Biblical critics denied the use of Hebrew
and promoted the theory that the gospel writers used Aramaic and
Greek in an effort to dilute the Jewishness of the gospels.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only in the language of the Gospels and of Jewry that
biblical critics take issue with the facts of history, but in the
historical truth and validity of the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   With a subtle anti-Semitic agenda behind liberal scholarly
theories about the Old and New Testaments, biblical critics have
developed, according to Ben Levi's book ``Revelation,'' a ``dogma
that nothing original came from the Jews'' and that ``the existence
of miracle, prophecy, and revelation (without which no
understanding of the Bible is possible) were denied in a dogmatic
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   These anti-supernaturalists theorized that Matthew and Luke
``borrowed'' the language, style and, most importantly of all, the
viewpoint of Mark's condensed version of Jesus' life, and they
expanded upon Mark's account.
</P>
<P>
   This so-called Synoptic (i.e. similar viewpoint) theory was
developed and exploited by liberal scholars who did not accept the
possibility that four different men who knew Jesus and were his
disciples could be divinely inspired to write similar accounts from
what they witnessed from their own personal perspectives.
</P>
<P>
   Another aspect of the anti-supernaturalist theory is that the
gospels were written long after the fact. There are still many
diehards among biblical critics who accept their own dating of the
gospels and say they were not written by eyewitnesses. It is
precisely here, in the clash between unbelief and belief, that
liberals and believers cross swords.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the testimony of the early church reminds us that the
gospels have as much historical as ethical value and that apostles
such as Bartholomew and Thomas, eyewitnesses to the ministry of
Jesus, did not give their lives for a mere myth.

<P>
   The approaching Christmas season is a time of celebration, hope
and joy in the birth of the Messiah. But some biblical critics
don't see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, they have offered many theories challenging
gospel accounts and the events described in the New Testament. But
now, out of the catacombs of history, comes new information that
will startle skeptics and make the hearts of believers rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Long buried in ancient texts are surprising accounts that will
revolutionize old assumptions that Thomas was the only apostle who
went to India, that the Jews of Jesus' time spoke Aramaic and not
Hebrew, that the four gospels were originally written in Greek and
that Mark's gospel was the first of them.
</P>
<P>
   This newly uncovered information further confirms that Matthew,
an eyewitness to the miracles and events of Jesus' ministry, was
indeed the author of the first gospel and verifies both the
Jewishness and early date of the first gospel.
</P>
<P>
   Now we have a clear mention that the Gospel of Matthew was
written in Hebrew -- not Greek or Aramaic, as widely thought -- and
was carried out of Israel by one of the original apostles to the
Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the earliest church fathers and historians, Eusebius and
Origen, wrote that a second, long-overlooked apostle, Bartholomew,
also went to India and took a gospel text with him, according to
Princeton scholar and author Samuel Moffett.
</P>
<P>
   In his ground-breaking book, ``A History of Christianity in
Asia,'' Moffett reveals that Pantaenus, a church historian and
missionary who traveled to India in 180 A.D., discovered the copy
of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew that Bartholomew had taken with
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is reported,'' wrote Eusebius, a fourth-century bishop and
church historian, ``that among persons there who knew Christ,
(Pantaenus) found the Gospel according to St. Matthew (which had
arrived ahead of Pantaenus by more than a century). For
Bartholomew, one of the apostles, had preached to them and left
them (in India) the writing of Matthew in the Hebrew language which
they had preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shock hidden in that rather matter-of-fact
statement. ... The surprise, of course, is the mention of
Bartholomew as the pioneer to the East,'' Moffett says.
</P>
<P>
   Many scholars are unaware of an apostle other than Thomas ever
going to India, and some even doubt that Thomas himself went.
</P>
<P>
   Moffett ponders, ``What was Bartholomew ... doing in India with
a Hebrew Gospel of Matthew?''
</P>
<P>
   Why India?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewish colonies are known to have existed in India from very
early times,'' Moffett writes, ``If there were, as tradition
asserts, Hebrew or Aramaic copies of the Gospel in circulation as
early as that, it is not unreasonable to imagine a Jewish
missionary using one in his evangelistic work, for it was the
apostolic missionary tradition to preach first to the Jewish
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, two historical records -- the New Testament's
Book of Acts and the writings of the Church Fathers -- confirm some
of Moffett's assertions.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Gospels were so thoroughly Jewish, there was no
concept among Jewish believers of preaching to gentiles. According
to Acts, Jewish believers in Israel were horrified to learn that
Peter entered a gentile home and preached to gentiles. Jews did not
preach to gentiles until the Jewish believers fled from persecution
to the Greek city of Antioch in Asia Minor.
</P>
<P>
   While the Book of Acts lists the 11 apostles -- Judas having
hanged himself -- it doesn't say how they were paired. But what is
known is that Jesus instructed his disciples to work and travel by
twos.
</P>
<P>
   So, it would be natural for Thomas to travel with a companion to
India and for Bartholomew to have taken along a freshly copied text
of Matthew's gospel, especially if it were the first and only
gospel written at the time. Jews customarily took their sacred
texts with them, as we see from the New Testament accounts of

AS MARTHA GOES, SO GOES THE MILLENNIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've been hoping to spend a quiet false millennium eve at home,
but now I'm not so sure if I should, or even if I can. I feel so
inadequate. But more of that in a moment.
</P>
<P>
   It's picky, I know, to call it the false millennium, but I'm
siding with the cranks who say the next millennium doesn't begin
until Jan. 1, 2001. Why? Well, personally, I've never put much
stock in the Synod of Whitby. The whole calendar concept is iffy.
Next year is 5761 by the Hebrew calendar, 4698 by the Chinese.
Think about it.
</P>
<P>
   But let's not dwell on the tiresome debate about when the
millennium begins, because there are bigger fish to fry, or bigger
fish to poach in a carefully prepared court bouillon and to serve
garnished with a spectacular sauce cardinal, or perhaps a simple
hollandaise.
</P>
<P>
   I am, of course, referring to Martha Stewart and her plans to
greet the millennium, real or false. I don't know where Martha
stands on the possibility of a millennial apocalypse, but I do know
that as the year 2000 approaches, she will be entertaining as if
the world were coming to an end. But what else is new?
</P>
<P>
   Recently I purchased a special issue of Martha Stewart
Entertaining, devoted to celebrating the start of the next century.
Martha cannily declines to mention the M-word on the magazine's
cover, but it's clear from its contents she believes the new
millennium will begin on Jan. 1, 2000. She plans to see it in at
home _ at one of her homes, Skylands, the old Edsel Ford estate in
Seal Harbor, Maine _ with friends and family. She suggests that her
readers also stay at home and entertain. Hence the magazine is full
of festive suggestions for greeting the millennium the Martha
Stewart way.
</P>
<P>
   It occurs to me that this may explain why so many hotels,
resorts, and restaurants have been reporting a surprising slacking
off in reservations for New Year's 2000. It may be because they've
jacked up their millennium party prices beyond reason _ but the
reason could also be that Martha has spoken. Stay at home, Martha
has decreed, and ``greet this new millennium in spectacularly
original ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as? It exhausts me to even think about it all. Really, I
want to sit down and cry when I consider how ill-prepared I am to
usher in the year 2000 at home, a la Martha. I don't even own one
Champagne flute, let alone a set. And I am shockingly short on
caviar spoons and smoked-salmon knives and Stilton cheese scoops.
But I have only myself to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine doesn't relate exactly what Martha will be doing to
celebrate New Year's Eve 1999. However, she will be greeting the
dawn of the year 2000 on top of Cadillac Mountain in Maine. There,
at 7:04 a.m., the first rays of sunrise will be visible in the
continental United States. Martha being Martha, she organized a
trial run last New Year's Day and had the proceedings photographed
for this magazine. Unfortunately, and vexingly for Martha, the
mountain trail was too icy for her party to negotiate, so they had
to settle for watching the sunrise from a rocky ledge overlooking
Frenchman Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to Martha's kitchen at Skylands, which seats 18
comfortably, for a simple six-course country breakfast. I'm not
sure which item on the menu was my favorite. Maybe the grapefruit
mimosas, which were served in translucent candied grapefruit bowls
and garnished with caramelized grapefruit chips. Or perhaps it was
the bruleed Irish oatmeal with apple and pear chips, prunes, maple
syrup, and heavy cream. Not that it matters what I like because,
real or false, it's Martha's millennium. I'd better get used to it.

   MIAMI _ When newly minted teen star Christina Aguilera decided
to record a Spanish-language version of her smash hit ``Genie in a
Bottle,'' she didn't hop a limo to a state-of-the art recording
studio in New York or LA. Instead Aguilera _ who is half Ecuadorean
and grew up outside of Pittsburgh _ traveled to South Florida, to
record at producer Rudy Perez's home studio in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tiny room, really, just off the swimming pool, with
enough space for a love seat and a few potted plants. Perez's four
sons have the run of the place, and the family dog pokes his nose
in whenever he pleases. The casual ambience, however, is deceiving.
Perez, the son of Cuban immigrants, is a 20-year veteran who has
written and produced music for virtually every major Latin artist,
from Julio Iglesias and Jose Feliciano to Mexican pop star Cristian
and salsa sensation Marc Anthony to up-and-comers Millie and Jaci
Velasquez.
</P>
<P>
   Perez is producing a full-length album for Aguilera. Her reverse
crossover, from English to Spanish, is a sign of just how
entrenched Latin music has become in the US mainstream. Far from a
novelty, the so-called Latin Explosion mirrors an exploding
generation of Latin American music fans _ kids and young adults who
are not just bilingual but thoroughly bicultural. It's a generation
that grew up immersed in pop, rock, and hip-hop, but who also heard
traditional music in their parents' and grandparents' homes. And as
the multitudes of Latin musical styles begin to merge into the US
mainstream, Miami is emerging as the epicenter of Latin music. It's
a city with unique potential, but also one that's suffering from
the problems that accompany tremendous growth. Not least among
them, of course, is the question of whether that growth is going to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its geographical and cultural proximity to Latin
America, Miami is ground zero for artists, producers, and record
labels. All six major multinational labels _ Sony, EMI, Polygram,
WEA, Universal, and BMG _ have their Latin music headquarters
there; so do publishing titans BMI and ASCAP. LARAS, the newly
established Latin arm of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences, is based in Miami, busily preparing for the first Latin
Grammy Awards show, to be broadcast next September.
</P>
<P>
   The real action, though, is happening on tony North Bay Road, a
quiet swath of upscale homes that face Biscayne Bay on Miami
Beach's North Shore. The street has become something of an enclave
in the last few years. With the exception of Emilio Estefan _
Gloria's husband and the unofficial godfather of Latin &UR;  &LR; pop music,
whose massive white villa sits on a private residential island just
across the bay _ Latin music's movers and shakers have flocked to
this quiet neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   It's where Perez lives and works. Just up the street is the home
and studio of Kike Santander, who arrived in Miami from Colombia
five years ago, promptly composed an album for Gloria Estefan, and
has gone on to write and produce songs for Thalia, Jon Secada,
Alejandro Fernandez, Carlos Ponce, Los Tri-O, and the young
Argentine folk/pop singer Soledad. A few doors down is Desmond
Child, former rock singer turned hitmaker (he penned ``Dude Looks
Like a Lady'' for Aerosmith, ``You Give Love a Bad Name'' for Bon
Jovi, and songs for Cher, Hanson, Alice Cooper, and Kiss). Child,
who's half-Cuban, returned five years ago to his hometown of Miami,
where he wrote and produced ``Livin' La Vida Loca'' and much of the
rest of Ricky Martin's crossover album. He shuttles back and forth
between home and his studio, a few blocks away, in a gold golf
cart. Conveniently, Martin's digs are just down the road. And
Jennifer Lopez was spotted touring a house for sale, catty-corner
from Perez's, just a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Around here, the question on everyone's mind is: Can Latin music
sustain the incredible trajectory of the last eight months? Such
heavily hyped trends are generally as brief as they are lucrative.
But Latin music's roots stretch much farther and much deeper than
the current chart-topping crossover stars. As cover stories
heralding the latest craze disappear from newsstands, as Ricky
Martin's new single begins to slip on the charts, one wonders if
names like Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, and Enrique Iglesias _ all
of whom are topping the Billboard charts _ will disappear from the
pop radar. Or is Latin music assuming its rightful place in the
mainstream US market?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the boom this year (according to SoundScan, Latin music
sales for the first half of 1999 soared nearly 54 percent over the
same period in 1998), ``the whole Latin market in the US right now
is totally virgin,'' says Perez, an amiable, boyish 40-year-old
whose home office is lined ceiling to floor with gold and platinum
records. ``Even though it's very successful, 90 percent of the
artists are exports _ from Mexico, from Colombia. We haven't begun
to touch the artists who are here. My target will be to go into the
barrios in the Bronx, in South Central LA, and find the kids from
here who have parents who are Latin, but who have the American
culture. That's what we're going to see a lot more of.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez has demographics on his side. Fueled by massive
immigration and high birthrates, the US Latino population has grown
38 percent since 1990, to 31 million. The overall population, by
contrast, has grown just 9 percent. With more than a third of the
Latino population under 18, the boom has just begun. By the year
2005, it's predicted, Latinos will be the largest minority group in
the country, and by 2050, nearly a quarter of the population will
be Latino.
</P>
<P>
   True to his word, Perez has started the ball rolling. He
discovered a talented young singer who goes by the name Lazz
participating in a music program at a Miami high school, and
offered to produce demos for her. Lazz released her debut salsa
album on Warner Brothers International this past June, and is
planning a crossover R &AMP; B release for sometime next year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Lack of live music &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But Lazz, unfortunately, is an exception here. Vibrant as
Miami's cultural and musical landscape is, the city's live music
scene is practically nonexistent. Artists who record here generally
come from somewhere else. Many of South Florida's live music venues
have closed in the last few years. Two nights trolling for music
revealed that most clubs now boast velvet ropes and DJs rather than
bands. Cafe Nostalgia, a small storefront club on Southwest Eighth
Street in Little Havana _ a local hangout for musicians like Ruben
Blades and Bono _ is one of the few left, and it's a gem. This is a
problem that will have to be resolved, says Desmond Child, if Miami
hopes to become an industry hub on a par with Los Angeles, New
York, and Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming into record companies already developed from
other regions,'' says Child, who recently established his own
Miami-based label, Destin Records. ``So then it's all corporate.
Everybody's already in their own world, and there's no feeling or
desire to cross-pollinate.''
</P>
<P>
   Infrastructure is a problem, too. There are only half a dozen
world-class recording studios in the area _ barely enough to keep
up with the increasing demand. Miami's music community is also
short on support personnel: managers, marketing executives, and PR
people.

<P>
   Child, a veteran of both the LA and New York music scenes, is
cautiously optimistic. ``Miami's sort of like the Wild West right
now. People are showing up thinking something's going to happen,
and maybe it will. It took a long time to build Music Row in
Nashville. There's a showcase every night there, people auditioning
for labels, and everybody comes out. In order for that to happen
here it has to be more like a village, not just kingdoms and
serfdoms.'' To that end, Child has started Songwriters in the
Round, a monthly gathering of local talent dedicated to fostering a
sense of community among Miami's musicians. Without that sort of
interaction, Child says, ``ideas will become stale, and you'll get
the same old sound.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a cautionary message that the industry at large should
heed. If record-label honchos with dollar signs dancing in their
eyes decide to exploit the moment to roll out copies of Ricky
Martin, a great opportunity will be lost. ``This is our chance,''
says Mauricio Abaroa, president of the Latin Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences. Abaroa came to Miami from Mexico City in 1996;
lately he's spent little time in LARAS's two-year-old Miami Beach
office between to trips to LA for screening-committee meetings and
trips to the 15 Latin American countries that are represented by
LARAS. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Carpeting the industry &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried that the industry leaders may not try to
understand our music, and they're an essential part of making this
happen,'' says Abaroa. ``Someone needs to let them know that they
have a big responsibility to find substantial talent. Jennifer and
Ricky and Marc and Enrique _ they are the best ambassadors. Now we
need to come in with all our roots, and all the power of our music,
and carpet the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Kike Santander, who's been Emilio Estefan's right-hand man since
1994, would like to lead the charge. A towering, 39-year-old former
doctor, Santander proudly shows off the just-finished recording
studio at his waterfront home, where he's currently producing four
new acts that he hopes will keep Latin music in the US mainstream.
``If you try to be somebody else, you are lost. I want to try to
create my own sound,'' Santander says, ``just as Emilio created his
own.'' Santander is so excited about one of his projects _ a cumbia
hip-hop band from Los Angeles _ he declines even to name it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a delicate balance, though, between promoting high-quality
art and feeding a profit-hungry commercial venture. While the
onslaught of Latin crossover artists may seem sudden, the process
has been ongoing, and executed with more forethought than one might
imagine, for years. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there have been plenty of crossover pockets that
were accidental things,'' says Jose Behar, president and CEO of EMI
Latin. Behar was born in Cuba and raised in Miami; in 1989, he made
crossover history by signing the late Tejano singer Selena to his
label. Her 1995 English-language album, ``Dreaming of You,'' became
the first album by a Latin artist ever to enter the Billboard
charts at No. 1. ``Santana's `Evil Ways,' or `La Bamba,' musical
events dating all the way back to Xavier Cugat, none of those,''
Behar points out,``were planned out.'' (Carlos Santana, by the way,
is enjoying the biggest hit of his 30-year career right now;
``Supernatural'' has been at No. 1 for three weeks.)
</P>
<P>
   Then in the late '80s, Gloria Estefan and the Miami Sound
Machine introduced Cuban rhythms to the US mainstream with a string
of Latin-flavored pop singles. That, Behar says, was a critical
turning point. ``When Gloria crossed over, it was Emilio's vision.
He planned it and made it happen. And then of course we were
looking for another Gloria, to sell to this new bicultural
consumer. When Selena crossed over, it sent a red alert through the
system: There's a business here. Around the same time Jon Secada
happened, and it was written in stone. Gloria, Selena, Jon . . .
the time gaps became compressed. It established the fact that the
market was there if you delivered the right product. Now you see
the phenomenon of Ricky and Jennifer and Marc Anthony, and I must
give credit to my competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Tommy Mottola, president of Sony, who threw the
full force of his label's resources behind the careers of Martin,
Lopez, and Anthony. Many feel that it was Mottola who really had
his finger on the pulse, who recognized the massive consumer
potential of the burgeoning US Latino population. ``That was
brilliantly, brilliantly planned,'' says Behar. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Opposed to the hype &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's precisely the perspective that makes Marc Anthony
bristle. The 30-year-old salsa singer recently released his debut
English-language album, which is No. 13 on the Billboard album
charts this week. ``I Need to Know,'' a twitchy, salsa-flavored pop
track, is a huge hit, holding steady at No. 6 after nine weeks on
the Hot 100 singles charts. ``I feel so caught in the hype. It
disturbs me to even think about, that I might have been accepted
because I'm Latin and not by the merit of my music,'' says Anthony,
who became widely known several years ago when he starred in the
ill-fated Broadway production of Paul Simon's ``The Capeman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very weird moment. So many people are getting it so
wrong. It's pop music! I grew up listening to Gloria Gaynor and Air
Supply. If I had more African influences I'm sure it would have
shown up. But I'm from New York. I'm Puerto Rican. I'm both,''
declares Anthony, who recently began work on his next salsa album.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he concedes that there's a silver lining to all the hype.
``I'm glad that Latinos in general feel like this might be their
chance to express themselves. I just beg them not to do it because
it's the chic thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their motivations, there's no shortage of Latino
musicians from every region, and every genre, lining up to explore
the possibilities. EMI Latin has 12 new artists _ Tropical, Rock,
Latin Rap, and Mexican rock _ slated for release in the next
quarter. Universal Music has seven Latin artists releasing albums
in the next four months. Welterweight boxer Oscar De La Hoya begins
sessions at Rudy Perez's house later this month for his debut
album, a bolero-pop collection due out next spring. Colombian star
Shakira is poised to make a huge crossover splash. And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   While there's no denying the impact of the rapidly growing
Latino youth population, the Anglo audience is buying Latin music,
too _ and not just Ricky Martin records. ``The perception a few
years ago for Anglos was that Latin music was mariachi. Restaurant
music. Great for a party,'' says Jose Behar. ``What's happened now
is it's been hipified. It's hip to like Latin music.'' Desmond
Child concurs: ``Ricky showed everyone how fun and cool and sexy it
is.''
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Anglos are opening their ears to Latin music beyond
radio-ready pop. ``When I speak to an American and ask him to
describe Latin music, the first word out of his mouth is `passion,'
'' says Mauricio Abaroa _ a feature of Anglo pop and rock that's
admittedly grown dimmer and dimmer. ``That's what the crossover
phenomenon has done: It's enabled the Latin music world to expose
itself, its many flavors, and create the awareness it has long
deserved,'' says Behar.
</P>
<P>
   Still, says Abaroa, ``we are at the crossroads. The mainstream
American market is turning to us and saying, `What is this?' Now it
must be good talent. Fresh talent. I hope they don't churn out 10
more Rickys and 10 more Jennifers.'' And if they do? ``Both ways
will climb, of course. But one will only have results for five or
six years. The other,'' says Abaroa with great hope, and not a
little determination, ``will last a long, long time.''

FIONA APPLE: TRYING TO MAKE HERSELF PROUD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Fixes title of album in 5th graf.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Fiona Apple was younger _ she's still only 22 _ she had
rules for herself. One was ``to always question my motives.''
Another was ``to always make myself proud of myself.'' She has
struggled along the way _ for years she didn't even tell her
friends she was writing songs _ but that changed when she sold 3
million copies of her debut album, ``Tidal,'' which came out in
1996. She was only 19 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Apple took some lumps from critics who called her a ``waif'' and
said she popularized the trendy ``heroin chic'' look. But Apple
threw a few jabs of her own when she got up at the MTV Video Awards
in 1998 and said, ``You shouldn't model your life on what you think
we think is cool, and what we're wearing and what we're saying. . .
. Go with yourself, go with yourself!''
</P>
<P>
   The outburst got her branded a loose cannon, but she has no
regrets about it. ``I am proud of myself for everything I did last
time,'' she says from her new home in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The famously self-reliant Apple is back with her second album,
which comes out Tuesday. Its title is the longest in pop history.
It's from a poem she wrote and helps sum up her world view.
Although the title has already been satirized in a few
publications, Apple says it's preferable to those ``three-word
album titles that sound like movie names.''
</P>
<P>
   Here it is: ``When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a
King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and
He'll Win the Whole Thing 'fore He Enters the Ring There's No Body
to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might So When You Go Solo, You
Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of
Heights and If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to
Land and If You Fall It Won't Matter, Cuz You'll Know That You're
Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote the poem when I was on the road and getting a lot of
backlash,'' she notes. ``It was a way of saying that no matter what
happens, even if you do make a mistake, even if you do fall down,
you do know where you stand, and it doesn't change who you are. And
even if everyone says you're wrong, if you know you are right,
you're still right.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple is much happier this time around. She just bought a house
in Los Angeles with her boyfriend, filmmaker Paul Thomas Anderson,
who wrote and directed ``Boogie Nights'' and has a new movie,
``Magnolia,'' due in Boston early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I got off the road, I finally settled down and have
friends and have a life now,'' says Apple. ``It's quite different
from how it was before. I felt like I was in the middle of nowhere
before. It's a lot more stable this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple, who toured for two years to back her debut disc (which
featured the megahit ``Sleep to Dream''), grew up on Manhattan's
Upper West Side before signing a recording contract when she was
18. That came after she gave a demo to music publicist Kathy
Schenker, who works with Sting and Peter Gabriel. Schenker passed
it on to Wallflowers manager Andy Slater, who loved it and opted to
manage Apple's career.
</P>
<P>
   An overnight success story, Apple wove magical piano-pop songs
exuding street credibility. Her deep, cutting voice also belied her
years. It was hard to believe that she grew up listening to mostly
jazz acts and the Beatles, while never being a fan of pop radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't listen to music at all now,'' she says. ``That makes
it feel strange sometimes, because music is really not a part of my
life unless I'm doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did she attend many concerts as a youth _ she only recalls
seeing Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross, and she sat far away in both
cases. ``I just did not understand why anybody would want to go and
be there when they could listen (at home) and actually hear the
music. . . . And that still enters my mind when I am on stage. It's
like, `I don't understand why they are here, because some of them
are obviously having trouble hearing and seeing me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Apple had no frame of reference when she started playing her own
shows after her debut CD took off. ``I had to improvise a lot
because I had never performed before,'' she says. ``It just seemed
impossible to think, `Oh my God, I'm going to have to go on stage
and carry a show.' . . . I would ask my bandmates about what other
people do. Do they talk between songs? When I first went out, I
felt really weird and fake for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple, who won't tour until February (though she'll likely do
some radio-sponsored Christmas shows), is feeling much more
confident these days. However, the new album, like its predecessor,
still has a lot of moody love songs, though the quality is again
high. And there's only one ``happy-ending song,'' she says. It's
``I Know,'' a string-laden ballad that could fit into Carly Simon's
songbook. Otherwise, the tunes don't rock as hard as those on the
first album but are better crafted, with help from ingenious
producer/multiinstrumentalist Jon Brion, the former Bostonian who
has worked with Aimee Mann.
</P>
<P>
   The album, with expanded sound textures and strings, should
smash any notion of a sophomore jinx. Still, it's surprising that,
despite her success, there's only one happy-ending tune. That's
because, like many other writers, Apple works best when she's upset
rather than in bliss. That's reflected in the new single, ``Fast As
You Can,'' with its admission, ``I may be soft in your palms, but
I'll soon grow hungry for a fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like getting angry and kicking a hole in your wall,'' she
says of composing songs. ``When I write, it's usually because
something has'' angered her. ``I'll sit down at the piano and feel
better about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Writing as therapy, then?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she says. ``And the fact that it's become a career is
just a very profitable side effect. But, you know what? I'd be
doing it anyway.''

ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANCESTRY CLASH OVER SKELETON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Wash., N.M., Texas, Ore., Ariz.)   (See also SCI-EARLIEST-AMERICANS)  
 (af)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Not all the conflicts in the search for the earliest
Americans center on rival scientists with sharply different
interpretations of the bones and artifacts they are finding.
Emboldened by a 1990 federal law, American Indians have joined the
fight with forceful claims that it is, after all, their past that
all the fuss is over.
</P>
<P>
   The uneasy relationship between archaeologists and the people
they study has erupted into a bitter court battle over the skeleton
of a muscular, middle-aged man who died sometime between 8,000 and
9,300 years ago. His remains were found in 1996 on the banks of the
Columbia River in eastern Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Called Kennewick Man, for the town near the discovery site, the
skeleton is the most complete and among the oldest uncovered in
North America.
</P>
<P>
   The skeleton's discovery and its unusual features have raised
questions about its position as a likely ancestor of modern
American Indians and, if this cannot be established, whether it
must by law be turned over for reburial by Indians in the area.
Eight anthropologists have filed a lawsuit to prevent immediate
reburial of the remains until they can be examined in greater
detail for new evidence bearing on the origins of the people who
first inhabited the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   The court case, expected to be decided sometime next year, could
set a precedent for other Indian claims over archaeological
materials that are based on the Native American Graves Protection
and Repatriation Act, under which relics found on U.S. property are
to be offered to Indian tribes affiliated with them. The question
of affiliation between distantly prehistoric remains and modern
tribes is a central issue.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the skull and bones of Kennewick Man rest under tight
security in a laboratory here at the Burke Museum of Natural
History and Culture on the campus of the University of Washington.
They are the property for the time being of the Army Corps of
Engineers, because they were discovered on land owned by the corps.
No one can take a peek without a court order.
</P>
<P>
   Though locked away, Kennewick Man was the object of scientific
conjecture, legal interpretation and impassioned debate at a
two-day symposium here.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came days after a group of anthropologists, led by
Dr. Joseph Powell of the University of New Mexico, announced
results of a preliminary analysis of the bones. Confirming earlier
findings, the researchers concluded that Kennewick Man's narrow
face, long head and jutting chin bore little resemblance to an
Indian's typically broad face, high cheekbones and round head. The
examination, they said, reminded them more of South Asians,
Polynesians or the Ainu of Japan.
</P>
<P>
   In light of these results, archaeologists argued more forcefully
that the skeleton was too old to be ``culturally affiliated'' with
modern Indians and so the federal law should not apply. They
expressed doubts that any modern tribes could establish that they
were ``lineal descendants'' of the people represented by Kennewick
Man.
</P>
<P>
   But noting that ``modern human variation may be different from
that seen in the past,'' Powell said at the symposium that people
have probably changed over the last 12,000 years. The early
migrants to America presumably spread over the land in small groups
subject to what is called genetic drift.
</P>
<P>
   Random changes and mutations in small groups become magnified
over time, affecting the way people looked. Only after populations
increased and mingled more closely, it could be argued, did they
develop physical characteristics more like those of modern Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if the early people don't look like modern Indians, it's
possible they are ancestral to today's Native Americans,'' Powell
said. ``It's an option that needs to be examined.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a similar tack, Dr. David J. Meltzer of Southern
Methodist University said it was no surprise that Kennewick Man and
several other prehistoric skeletons did not look like modern
Indians. ``That doesn't mean the two are unrelated,'' he said, ``or
that we have to look elsewhere than Asia for their origins.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy McKeown, an archaeologist with the National Park
Service, explained that the 1990 law did not require that the
relationship of modern tribes to human remains and objects be
proved ``with scientific certainty.'' According to the law, a
``preponderance of evidence'' from oral tradition as well as
geographical, historical and archaeological sources is acceptable
for repatriation of remains to Indian tribes.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference in Santa Fe the next week, a lawyer for the
eight scientists in the lawsuit, Alan Schneider of Portland, Ore.,
argued that legal restrictions on the study of early skeletons
threatened research that seeks to explain who were the first
Americans. ``Science can't proceed if scientists can't get access
to new data,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the Seattle meeting, Rebecca Tsosie, an American Indian and
executive director of the Indian legal program at Arizona State
University, contended that legal, legislative and treaty precedents
established Indians as ``separate nations, nations within a
nation'' and, in particular, that ``European people do not have a
claim'' on remains that predate the Columbus ``discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Western science,'' Ms. Tsosie said, ``gives us a way of
knowing the world, a noble goal, but it's not the only way to
establish something as the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The controversy over Kennewick Man has opened old wounds over
how archaeologists and other scientists treated Indians in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they thought Indian people no longer existed, that
they were extinct,'' Adeline Fredin, historian for the Confederated
Tribes of the Colville Reservation, said with a soft, but eloquent
voice. ``Did they ever come to Indian country and say we want to
collect Indian remains? Is that all right? They never did. Did they
ever come to Indian country and say we want to do some cranial
analysis and collect all the Indian heads we can. Did they ask us?
No, they did not.''

GOP CHAIRMAN TOUTS GIULIANI IN SENATE RACE AGAINST FIRST LADY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republican Chairman Jim Nicholson weighed in on the
budding New York Senate race Monday, praising GOP New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani for making New York City a place that residents
could be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson also criticized First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and
predicted that the Senate contest would cost up to $50 million.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said Giuliani's performance during two terms as mayor
of predominantly Democratic New York City demonstrates the fiscal
restraint and anti-crime priorities that Guiliani would bring to
the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Both Giuliani and Clinton have completed legal requirements to
be Senate candidates from New York in 2000 but neither has publicly
declared a candidacy to succeed retiring Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has ``turned what was often thought of as an
unmanageable metropolis into a place where people take great pride
in living, in owning and in working,'' Nicholson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has cut the murder rate by 70 percent and the violent
crime rate by 50 percent, as well as reducing welfare rolls by
360,000 and creating more than 300,000 new private sector jobs,
Nicholson boasted.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson credited Giuliani with encouraging major companies to
return to New York City, a one-time ``tax hell, where people
wouldn't look anybody in the eye _ they were that afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson added: ``He's turned that around.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani can ``beat Hillary,'' Nicholson said in response to a
question. ``He's whomping her right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said Clinton also has paid a price in the polls for
``waffling'' on presidential clemency for imprisoned Puerto Rican
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a poll by Zogby International completed on Oct. 18 that
showed Giuliani leading Mrs. Clinton by 11 percentage points _ 51
percent to 40 percent. The survey of 700 likely voters had a margin
of error of 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The result showed Giuliani widening his margin over a comparable
Zogby poll completed on Sept. 9 that showed a statistical dead
heat, with Giuliani leading Clinton 48 percent to 44 percent in a
survey with a margin of error of 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson reiterated his earlier criticisms of Clinton's
exploration of a Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Her decision to seek a Senate seat from New York, where she has
never lived nor worked, fuels ``the carpet bag thing'' that shadows
her bid as ``sort of an overarching issue,'' Nicholson said.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said each candidate would ``have to spend between $20
million and $25 million'' in the premier Senate race of the 2000
election. Nicholson said Clinton's nationwide fund raising for the
first Senate race by a first lady would ``pull money'' away from
the Democratic presidential nominee but not pose ``as big a drain
on us as it is on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said the New York Senate race was not a ``must win''
for the GOP, adding: ``I think it's more of a `must win' for the
Democrats because of who she is, the tie between her and Gore and
the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson's reference to the first lady ``waffling'' on clemency
for Puerto Rican nationalists stemmed from the president's offer of
clemency to 16 imprisoned Puerto Rican nationalists on Aug. 11. The
president said he hadn't talked to his wife about the clemency
offer before he announced it.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, after remaining silent for three weeks, later
urged her husband in a public statement on Sept. 4 to cancel the
offer.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the Puerto Rican nationalists accepted the
president's offer on Sept. 7.

 &HT;    Concussion can't stop Leard's Georgia dream
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Ben Leard doesn't sound like a player considered
questionable for Saturday's game against Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Auburn quarterback said he will play against the 14th-ranked
Bulldogs this weekend if it means driving to Sanford Stadium
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up wanting to play between the hedges, wanting to wear
the silver britches, the whole thing,'' said Leard. ``I never
expected to be in somebody else's uniform when I played there, but
that's just the way it worked out. They're crazy if they think they
can keep me off the field this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Leard missed Saturday's game against Central Florida after being
knocked unconscious in the second quarter of the Arkansas game the
previous week. He was diagnosed with a concussion but practiced all
last week and thought he would be able to play, only to be
scratched in a game-day decision.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn scored 21 points in 1:32 late in the fourth quarter for a
28-10 win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' Leard said Sunday. ``If you ask me, I've been 100
percent ever since I woke up. I understand the doctors are just
looking out for me, but I don't see how they can keep me from
playing this time. . . . I'm going to play this weekend if they
have to wheel me off in a wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   Leard has battled injuries not only all season but all his
career. He missed three games after separating his throwing
shoulder in a loss to Mississippi on Sept. 25. In December, he had
surgery to repair two bulging disks in his back. But when he has
been healthy, Leard has been impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Leard had completed 14 of 17 passes for 100 yards when he was
injured against Ole Miss and was 5 of 8 for 41 yards before going
out against Arkansas. For the year, he has completed 61 of 88
passes for 770 yards, six touchdowns and no interceptions. His
pass-efficiency rating of 169.16 would lead the SEC by 27 points,
but he has played in too few games to be ranked.
</P>
<P>
   In Leard's absence, the Auburn offense has been run by another
Georgian. Redshirt freshman Jeff Klein is 85 of 169 passing for
1,038 yards and six touchdowns but has thrown nine interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a better team when (Leard) is in there,'' Auburn coach
Tommy Tuberville said. ``He's got more experience, more maturity.
Jeff's had a chance to get better while Ben's been out, but Ben
knows the offense better and knows what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Either quarterback could have trouble against Georgia. Although
the Bulldogs have proved vulnerable to big plays _ as their 358
yards a game allowed will attest _ they are drawing increasing
respect from opponents for their ability to rush the passer and
force turnovers. Georgia has 3.3 sacks per game, fifth in the SEC,
leads the league with 18 interceptions and is ranked third
nationally in turnover margin, plus-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to come after you, and we know that,'' Leard
said. ``I was watching them against Kentucky during our off week,
and they had, like, 11 sacks and six or seven in the first half.
They're playing like the old Junkyard Dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for circumstances beyond his control, Leard might
otherwise be on the Georgia sideline for Saturday's game. At the
time he was being recruited by the Bulldogs, they had just fired
Ray Goff, hired and lost Glen Mason as head coach, brought in a
relatively unknown Division I-AA coach named Jim Donnan and were
facing NCAA probation.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Georgia had a glut of players at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hines (Ward) was still there, and Mike Bobo, and Mike Usry had
just come in; I think they had six (quarterbacks), including
Hines,'' Leard said. ``And a lot of other things were kind of up in
the air. My visit weekend was coach Donnan's first one on campus.
There was a lot of confusion. It was still a real toss-up between
Auburn and Georgia, but I made what I thought was the best decision
at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, Leard finally will live out his dream of
playing in Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to play in this game so long; I can't put into
words how much I want to win,'' Leard said. ``It'll be like I'm in
a dream world or something.''

   WASHINGTON _ With the presidential election less than a year
off, an Internet site that provides equal video access to all the
2000 candidates went online Monday on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The new Internet site, freedomchannel.com, began webcasting as
President Clinton hosted a 90-minute virtual chat room,
inaugurating the first-ever presidential town hall meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty pumped up about this,'' said Al From, executive
director of the Democratic Leadership Council, which co-sponsored
the event with Excite (at) Home, an online service provider. ``The
president sees this new technology as a highly effective way of
communicating with people,'' From added.
</P>
<P>
   From was interviewed at the media rollout of the new
not-for-profit political video site several hours before he
moderated the unique town hall cybermeeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bailey, one of the nonpartisan group's co-founders, said:
``This site offers voters the first-ever one-stop shop for the
video views of candidates and issue groups. ... It allows voters to
dial up the candidates they are interested in, on the issues they
care about, all at times of their own choosing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 12 years ago, Bailey, along with Roger Craver, the other
co-founder, also created the Hotline, a subscription-based briefing
service for political junkies.
</P>
<P>
   The videos-on-demand are being webcast on an ad-free web site
hosted by Yahoo!, a major Internet portal. In addition to Yahoo!,
several major foundations have agreed to finance the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Video-on-demand will change our culture, our entertainment,
our communications, our information _ and our politics,'' Bailey
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the change in our politics starts right here, right now,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Users with access to older computers can access the data in
audio or in text form. By January, congressional and gubernatorial
candidates will also be online, with their full-frontal, 90-second
messages, along with a wide range of issue-orientated groups.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
front-runner, was the only major candidate who had yet to submit
his 90-second video messages to the all-inclusive Web site. His
recent televised campaign ads were posted, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a challenger, this an opportunity. If you're the
front-runner, it's a risk,'' said Bailey, who was a well-known
figure in Republican presidential politics before embarking on
Hotline. He said he expected Bush to join up soon.
</P>
<P>
   Although the video-on-demand site quickly elicited bipartisan
plaudits, Norman Ornstein, a resident scholar at the American
Enterprise Institute, sounded a note of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may well come a time when presidential candidates will
advertise exclusively on the Internet,'' Ornstein said. ``But we're
not there yet. Today, the broadcast networks remain by far the most
attractive option for candidates seeking to reach large numbers of
people with the messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, political operatives who spend much of their time
raising money to pay for political TV ads welcomed the site.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Chairman Joe Andrew said: ``This is big.
This is important, because it is not about raising money, it's
about raising interest. It's not about political contributions,
it's about political participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's views were largely echoed by Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.,
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Said
Davis:
</P>
<P>
   ``Several generations ago, people got their nearly all their
political information from pamphlets. Then along came newspapers
and, after that, they got it from radio and TV. Now we see more and
more voters getting their information online.''

raising money to pay for political TV ads welcomed the site.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Chairman Joe Andrew said: ``This is big.
This is important, because it is not about raising money, it's
about raising interest. It's not about political contributions,
it's about political participation.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew's views were largely echoed by Rep. Tom Davis, R-Va.,
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. Said
Davis:
</P>
<P>
   ``Several generations ago, people got their nearly all their
political information from pamphlets. Then along came newspapers
and, after that, they got it from radio and TV. Now we see more and
more voters getting their information online.''

TAXPAYERS IN UPROAR AS GRAND JURY PROBES TEXAS SUPERINTENDENT'S
EXPENSE ACCOUNT

<P>
   CORPUS CHRISTI, Texas _ Huge tabs at topless bars, meals in posh
New York restaurants and sexual predators on the school payroll
have prompted protests and a criminal investigation of practices in
the school district of this quiet, coastal city.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, community attention was largely focused on
academics, and the Corpus Christi Independent School District has
reason to brag because of dramatic improvements in student test
scores. Officials also can point to the quality of the district's
teachers, such as last month's selection of Mary Beth
Castillo-Tierce as the Texas Elementary School Teacher of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, Corpus Christi residents are mostly talking
about the grand jury investigation into the free-spending habits of
Superintendent Abelardo Saavedra, his staff and several members of
the board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The questionable expenditures came to light when the local
newspaper, the Corpus Christi Caller-Times, reviewed the district's
American Express accounts from August 1993 to June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Saavedra, a $171,000-a-year administrator with a $7,200 annual
car allowance, has claimed $15,402 in additional reimbursement for
gasoline purchases, car washes, detailing and mechanical repairs to
his vehicle, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Saavedra also charged taxpayers more than $15,000 for 144 meals
with district board members, and another $5,149 for meals with
staff members, including a $500 dinner at the posh
Tavern-on-the-Green in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   A top Saavedra aide _ who has since left _ charged $5,200 in bar
tabs at topless clubs on his district-issued credit card, and two
board members bought tickets to a Tony Bennett concert in San
Francisco plus airline fares for their spouses on district cards.
Those expenses were repaid.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent insists that there was no intent to break the
law, but claims that a concerted effort is under way to destroy his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I made mistakes in reference to judgment or whatever,
obviously they need to be corrected,'' said Saavedra, who has
canceled the district's credit card accounts. ``If there needs to
be consequences, that's fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the attacks have been so vicious and so personal that I
kind of feel the aim is to destroy people, not just
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Nueces County District Attorney Carlos Valdez and
grand jury members began sifting through voluminous school district
financial records turned over under subpoena. It is the second
grand jury investigation of the district this year, following an
inquiry this spring into nine district employees who had been
charged with molesting students during Saavedra's six-year tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation is being conducted to make sure that all
financial matters involving the school district have been proper
and above-board,'' said Valdez, who declined to identify targets of
the investigation or what transactions are being questioned.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the grand jury criticized the district for failing to
screen sexual predators applying for school positions, and for not
promptly notifying police when teachers, coaches and other district
employees were discovered having sexual relationships with
students.
</P>
<P>
   While the grand jury investigation into sexual misconduct is
over, the troubling relationships between students and school staff
are not. But Valdez said Saavedra's staff is now acting much more
quickly in reporting them to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the district fired a Carroll High School
assistant football coach, Mark Marsh, &UR;  &LR; 25, &UR;  &LR; shortly after it was
reported he had a sexual relationship with a 17-year-old female
student. It was the same campus where assistant football coach and
health teacher Jason Murphy, 30, was prosecuted for having sex 28
times with a 16-year-old female student in February and March.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez said it may be weeks or months before it can be
determined if any laws were broken by the questionable
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a number of residents believe that Saavedra has
already earned a pink slip regardless of the outcome of the
criminal inquiry. But many residents have rallied around the
district's first Hispanic superintendent, and some claim that
racism by several Anglo board members is responsible for the
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately he was the boss, even though there was no financial
policy (concerning expenses) in place, he had a responsibility to
see to it that there was one _ that's what everyone's
saying,'' &UR;  &LR; said one local judge, who asked not to be
identified. &UR;  &LR; ``That's the basic reason we've got problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe O'Brien, president of 1,750-member Corpus Christi Taxpayer's
Association, said his group is considering filing suit to remove
Saavedra if he is not fired by the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a group trying to turn it into a political, ethnic
thing, but that has nothing whatsoever to do with it,'' said
O'Brien. ``It's a question of honesty. The man has violated his
contract. His contract requires him to obey all the laws, which he
hasn't done.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien noted many taxpayers were upset by the hefty $37,000
raise voted in April, boosting Saavedra's salary from $134,000 to
$171,000. The raise was part of a package of increased benefits
that O'Brien said total $82,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since we started looking into the situation and finding out
his extravagant tabs up in New York, $500 meals and living pretty
high on the hog, it just completely outraged the people,'' O'Brien
said.
</P>
<P>
   Saavedra, a product of the Corpus Christi school system, said he
has no intention of resigning, at least until he clears his name.
And with three years and eight months left on his new contract, a
buyout could cost the district $900,000, the school district
attorney has calculated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they're going to find criminal wrongdoing, but
who knows?'' Saavedra said of the grand jury's inquiry. ``What
they're going to find is a system of very poor controls when it
came to that credit card and some of the board travel.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; But the superintendent insists that he has been made a
scapegoat by warring factions of a deeply divided school board, and
he notes that criticism is coming from the very board members he
entertained.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, how do you condemn someone when you sat across the
table with me?'' Saavedra asked.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the board held a public meeting to decide if
Saavedra would be fired. It delayed a decision until the Texas
Education Agency concludes an audit of district expenditures in a
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The emotionally charged meeting lasted until midnight and 71
residents stepped up to speak. Many of Saavedra's supporters
charged that racism was behind the move to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   A group of mostly Anglo protesters brandished placards demanding
Saavedra's resignation, while the board room was packed with
members of Hispanic service groups who supported him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Saavedra is the target of racism by certain members of the
board of CCISD,'' insisted Mary Helen Salazar, president of the
local chapter of the League of United Latin American Citizens.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was referring to ``the ladies,'' three Anglo women
who have been at odds with the four male board members, three of
whom are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   A major battle erupted when the four men voted to boost
Saavedra's pay to $171,000, and the women opposed it. And it was
the three women who put the request to end Saavedra's tenure on the
agenda.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, many community leaders urged the board to wait
until all the facts were in and pointed to improvements they said
were made during Saavedra's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can see our system is working. If it ain't broke, don't fix
it,'' advised attorney Ruben Bonilla Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla held up charts indicating that district students are
leading the state in passing the writing, mathematics and reading
portions of the TAAS test. Bonilla said that when Saavedra became
superintendent, only 51 percent of the students passed the
statewide test compared with the 77 percent who passed in 1998.
Today, he said, 30 of the district's 60 schools are rated as either
recognized or exemplary.
</P>
<P>
   Outside grants to the district, which amounted to $700,000 when
Saavedra became superintendent, now exceed $20 million, Bonilla
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've listened a long time to the admiration society,''
countered resident Louis Loveless, who carried an anti-Saavedra
placard. ``Dr. Saavedra, you had it well-organized. (But) If this
district is so great as Mr. Bonilla and others claim, how come Del
Mar (Community) College has so many remedial courses?
</P>
<P>
   ``You heard the teachers say they had spent their own money on
supplies, while you live lavishly on credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   At the close of the meeting, trustee Frank Reyes said the board,
during a closed-door session, had ``pledged to work together.''
</P>
<P>
   However, few residents have any illusions about the divisive
times ahead, given the bad blood between Saavedra and several
members of the board and the public relations fiasco the expense
account revelations have caused.
</P>
<P>
   Valdez, the district attorney, predicted that the grand jury
examination, while painful, will help restore public confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think eventually everything is going to be better, because
if there are some weaknesses in the system they will be exposed and
remedied,'' Valdez said. ``While we're going through it, it won't
be good for the community, but in the end it will be better.''

<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. _ For most of the 20th century, the solution to
the mystery of the original Americans _ where did they come from,
when and how? _ seemed as clear as the geography of the Bering
Strait, the climate of the last ice age and the ubiquity of finely
wrought stone hunting weapons known as Clovis points.
</P>
<P>
   According to the ruling theory, bands of big-game hunters
trekked out of Siberia sometime before 11,500 years ago. They
crossed into Alaska when the floor of the Bering Strait, drained
dry by the accumulation of water in a frozen world's massive
glaciers, was a land bridge between continents, and found
themselves in a trackless continent, the New World when it was
truly new.
</P>
<P>
   The hunters, so the story went, moved south through a corridor
between glaciers and soon flourished on the Great Plains and in the
Southwest of what is now the United States, their presence widely
marked by distinctive stone projectile points first discovered near
the town of Clovis, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   In less than 1,000 years, these Clovis people and their
distinctive stone points made it all the way to the tip of South
America. They were presumably the founding population of today's
American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Now a growing body of intriguing evidence is telling a much
different story. From Alaska to Brazil and southern Chile,
artifacts and skeletons are forcing archaeologists to abandon
Clovis orthodoxy and come to terms with a more complex picture of
earliest American settlement.
</P>
<P>
   People may have arrived thousands to tens of thousands of years
sooner, in many waves of migration and by a number of routes. Their
ancestry may not have been only Asian. Some of the migrations may
have originated in Australia or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Clovis-first paradigm ``has become increasingly
improbable,'' said Dr. Robson Bonnichsen, an archaeologist at
Oregon State University in Corvallis, opening a recent conference
here titled ``Clovis and Beyond'' at which archaeologists looked
beyond the shards of old theory in search of new explanations.
``Clovis was not the only culture in America 11,000 years ago,''
Bonnichsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Two discoveries _ remains of a pre-Clovis camp at Monte Verde in
Chile and the skull and bones of the Kennewick Man, possibly as old
as 9,300 years and bearing little physical resemblance to later
American Indians _ are primarily responsible for the profound shift
in thinking. Freed from the restrictive Clovis model,
archaeologists and other scholars have aired a wide assortment of
alternative explanations for the initial occupation of America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monte Verde puts the peopling of America in a new light,''
said Dr. David J. Meltzer of Southern Methodist University in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Meltzer was a member of a blue-ribbon panel of
archaeologists, including some resolute skeptics, who inspected the
Monte Verde site, which had been excavated by Dr. Tom D. Dillehay
of the University of Kentucky. The visitors took a close look at
the stone, wood and bone artifacts, remnants of hide-covered huts
and a child's footprint.
</P>
<P>
   These were judged to be clear evidence that humans had reached
southern Chile 12,500 years ago, more than a millennium before the
first signs of Clovis hunters in North America.
</P>
<P>
   After years of stout resistance from many establishment
archaeologists, the Clovis barrier had finally been breached. Monte
Verde was not only the first confirmed pre-Clovis site, but it was
nowhere near the Bering Strait and bore little resemblance to the
Clovis culture. It seemed time to examine more seriously other
migration hypotheses.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ice-free corridor on the eastern flank of the
Rockies did not open before 13,000 years ago, and does not appear
to have had many plants or animals to feed travelers, many scholars
have revived speculation of coastal migration routes.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the early people may have come from northeast Asia in
hide-covered boats, hugging the southern shore of the Bering land
bridge, putting in from time to time for food and water. They could
have continued down the west coast of North America long before the
glacial corridor was available to them.
</P>
<P>
   They could have traveled great distances in relatively short
periods, conceivably reaching South America much faster and more
easily than by any land routes. Prehistoric people at least as
early as the Australian colonists some 50,000 years ago had boats
capable of open-sea navigation.
</P>
<P>
   Coastal migration is an attractive idea, archaeologists at the
conference said, because it could explain the existence of Monte
Verde and other possibly pre-Clovis sites in several places in
South America and why their cultures, by Clovis times, bore few
similarities to North American settlers. Perhaps, Meltzer said,
``there were more, rather than fewer, migratory pulses to the
Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Establishing a coastal migration was once thought to be
hopeless. At the end of the ice age, melting glaciers raised sea
levels and inundated what had been ancient shorelines. But recent
artifact discoveries off British Columbia, in the Channel Islands
off California and along the coast of Peru have bolstered arguments
favoring coastal routes as one of many migration theories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clovis first and Clovis everywhere was a regional North
American phenomenon, and a late one at that,'' said Dr. Ruth Gruhn
of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, reflecting a view long
held by a few archaeologists working at South American sites.
``North Americans have been discounting South American evidence
because it did not fit their models.''
</P>
<P>
   Monte Verde also inspired researchers in North America to dig
deeper. They have found possibly pre-Clovis remains in South
Carolina and Virginia and are beginning to reinterpret findings at
the Meadowcroft rock shelter, a site near Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   This was how Dr. Albert Goodyear, a University of South Carolina
archaeologist, discovered likely pre-Clovis traces at the Topper
site near the Savannah River. ``I had stopped a little below the
Clovis stratum,'' Goodyear explained. ``You don't look for what you
don't believe in. But in light of Monte Verde, I thought, maybe
this might be a place to look for pre-Clovis.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasing evidence of early Clovis, and possibly pre-Clovis,
remains in the Eastern United States has raised eyebrows. Perhaps
the hunters who came through the ice-free corridor went east first,
then moved west. An even bolder idea is attracting debate: perhaps
ancestors of the Clovis hunters arrived not by the Bering land
bridge, but from Europe by boats skirting the ice of the North
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But if Monte Verde encouraged thinking about multiple
migrations, the discovery of the Kennewick Man, a skeleton found in
1997 in Washington State and dated between 8,000 and 9,300 years
old, raised unsettling questions about the origins of the first
Americans. Were they all from Asia? Are American Indians actually
direct descendants from the first migrants?
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Early descriptions of the Kennewick skull led to reports that
the man was Caucasoid and possibly European. After a more careful
analysis, the skull appeared to be longer and marrower than those
of modern American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Powell of the University of New Mexico reported last
month that its physical affinities appeared to be closer to those
of South Asians or Polynesians than either Europeans or American
Indians.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, Dr. Douglas Owsley of the Smithsonian
Institution and Dr. Richard Jantz of the University of Tennessee at
Knoxville reported that close examination of the craniums of
several other skeletons and mummies found in the Americas produced
similar results.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence, they said, suggested that either more than one
group of people migrated into the New World or the settlers
underwent significant physical changes in the time after their
arrival. It is even possible that the first migrants became
extinct, replaced by subsequent groups.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is central to a legal case pitting American Indians,
who claim Kennewick Man as an ancestor and want his remains turned
over to them for reburial, and anthropologists, who are seeking
access to the skeleton for more detailed studies, including DNA
tests of the man's genetic background.
</P>
<P>
   Another skeleton, of a woman being called Luzia, which was found
in Brazil, has prompted speculation of another origins scenario.
The skeleton, estimated to be possibly 11,500 years old and thus
older than any previous human bones in the Western Hemisphere,
appeared to be more Negroid in its cranial features than Mongoloid.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Neves of the University of Sao Paulo said this suggested
that some of the first people in South America might have
originated in Australia, or at least South Asia. Last month, he
said Luzia might have belonged to a nomadic people who began
arriving in the New World as early as 15,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They may have come across the Pacific, but more probably, he
said, they were a branch of Southeast Asians, some of whom settled
in Australia as the Aborigines while others navigated northward
along the Asian coast and then across the Bering Strait.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a long time before the shattered Clovis-first
hypothesis is replaced by a single new paradigm. In the meantime,
some Clovis partisans are not giving up without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   In the current issue of the magazine Scientific American
Discovering Archaeology, Dr. Stuart J. Fiedel of John Milner
Associates in Alexandria, Va., which conducts archaeological
excavations under contract, said that Dillehay's Monte Verde report
was riddled with errors and omissions that ``raised doubts about
the provenience of virtually every'' artifact excavated there.
Monte Verde, he concluded, ``should not be construed as conclusive
proof of a pre-Clovis human occupation in South America.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. C. Vance Haynes Jr. of the University of Arizona, one of the
staunchest defenders of the Clovis orthodoxy, said that, though he
had been a member of the panel of experts that authenticated Monte
Verde's pre-Clovis credentials, he now had serious second thoughts.
After further study of the evidence, he said, ``To my surprise, I
found these data to be inadequate and therefore unconvincing.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Monte Verde, published just before the conference
here, raised cries of foul. Many archaeologists complained that
Fiedel's review was biased and ignored material that did not
support his critical thesis. They deplored his tactic of airing his
critique in a popular magazine rather than a peer-reviewed journal.
</P>
<P>
   In a defense of Monte Verde, also published in the magazine,
Dillehay acknowledged that some errors had crept into the
1,300-page report and would be corrected, but none of them undercut
an interpretation of the place where pre-Clovis hunter-gatherers
camped 12,500 years ago. At the conference, he called Fiedel's
review ``ungrounded accusations'' and one more example of North
American archaeologists' dismissal of South American sites because
they lacked the familiar Clovis stone-tool technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The half-century-long emphasis on Clovis projectile points and
related durable lithic artifacts,'' argued Dr. James M. Adovasio of
Mercyhurst College in Erie, Pa., who excavated the long-disputed
Meadowcroft site and thus sees himself as another victim of Clovis
chauvinism, ``has actually served to mask rather than elucidate the
nature of late ice age adaptations in the New World.''
</P>
<P>
   Warming to the attack, Adovasio charged that evidence of ``soft
technologies'' such as cordage, netting and basketry was seldom
given its due at many early American sites. The result, he said,
was a failure to appreciate fully the way of life of the first
American colonizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nets suggest a subsistence strategy carried out by both sexes
and all age groups in stark contrast to the traditional model based
on highly mobile groups of spear-wielding, mammoth-killing macho
men,'' Adovasio said to another round of hearty applause.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of a paradigm has thus plunged American archaeology
into a new period of tumult and uncertainty over its oldest
mystery, one critical to understanding how modern humans spread out
through the world. For their entry into America was the last time
in history when people occupied an entirely new land, alone and
with little more than their own ingenuity and an eye on far
horizons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to open our minds,'' Dr. Michael B.
Collins of the University of Texas said at the conference. ``We're
going to have to explore some ideas that may not get us very far.
We're going to have to be tolerant of each other as we explore
these ideas. My God, this is an exciting time to be involved in
research in the peopling of America and the earliest cultures of
the Americas.''

AUTHOR DETAILS SILICON VALLEY MOGUL'S `NEW NEW THING' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRAD WIENERS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ On a recent Friday evening, author Michael
Lewis gave a talk in the library of UC-Berkeley's Northgate Hall
about his much-hyped book, ``The New New Thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who is a visiting fellow at Cal's graduate school of
journalism, and who, in 1993, penned one of the most passed-along
slams of graduate programs in journalism (``J-School Ate My
Brain''), sat comfortably in the middle of this seeming
contradiction and explained why he choose to focus his chronicle of
Silicon Valley on another contradictory figure, serial entrepreneur
Jim Clark.
</P>
<P>
   For ``The New New Thing,'' Lewis knew he had his man the day he
looked Clark up in the phone book, got him on the line, talked
himself into a drop-in visit and followed the instructions Clark
had given to an office in a strip mall, perched above a Jenny Craig
fitness center.
</P>
<P>
   Certain there'd been some mistake, he was astonished when the
billionaire answered the door. Peering into the gloom, where
several programmers toiled at computers, he took his book-launching
mental snapshot and wondered: What was this New Economic Force
doing in there?
</P>
<P>
   Deciding to build his book around the founder of Silicon
Graphics, Netscape, Healtheon and, most recently, myCFO.com, it
must be said, took guts.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: Clark's story has been told and told some more.
Indeed, you'd have to have had your head in a bucket for going on
seven years not to have read something about Clark.
</P>
<P>
   And your bucket would have to be a lead pail if you hadn't read
the part where Clark discovered an undergrad named Marc Andreessen
at the University of Illinois and convinced him to form a business
around this nifty piece of software he and his friends had created.
This ``browser'' software soon became Netscape Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Lewis discovers much about Clark that hasn't been
reported. (A trip to Clark's pitiful hometown of Plainview, Texas,
is especially affecting.) But he also overstates Clark's role in
all things Dot Com as if to justify writing about him one more
time.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there are stretches of ``The New New Thing'' where you'd
think Silicon Valley really should be renamed ClarkWorld (Lewis'
coinage), and that Clark didn't just popularize the World Wide Web,
but invented it. (This is far from true, and if you're really
interested in the origins of the Web, pick up Tim Berners-Lee's
``Weaving the Web'' instead.)
</P>
<P>
   The new new thing Clark did accomplish was to take Netscape
public before the company had turned a profit. This may well be
Clark's most enduring innovation. It is certainly his most
influential one, and one that Michael Milken probably wishes he
thought up.
</P>
<P>
   On this, Lewis is justified in his assertion that after
Netscape, ``the most appealing companies became those in a state of
pure possibility. Which is to say that the U.S. capital markets
acquired the personal predilections of Jim Clark.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lewis reflects, ``The Internet formula for success turned
traditional capitalism on its head. Traditionally, a company
persuaded people to invest in it by making profits. Now it
persuaded people to invest in it first, and hoped profits would
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   This is as precise a definition of the ``new economy'' as you
could ask for _ outside, perhaps, MIT economist Paul Krugman's
observation that technology has been the big story in economics
since the 1950s, but is also ``invoked as an explanation of
whatever we can't explain in other ways.''
</P>
<P>
   So why did Lewis take Netscape public when he did? Well, he
needed the cash. (As one engineer who has worked for Clark at three
of his companies tells Lewis, ``Jim Clark has a purity of vision
that is prompted by the purest form of greed. Nothing clouds it.'')
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Clark needed the dough for his state-of-the-art,
computer-operated sailboat, Hyperion, a ready-made metaphor that
nearly capsizes ``The New New Thing'' and does cause Lewis to miss
his point.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it's perfectly understandable Lewis would jump aboard the
Hyperion. In fact, his time at sea (Clark invites him along for a
trans-Atlantic passage) provides the book's best material: dinner-
party-length anecdotes that are masterful, often hilarious, and may
redeem the book for some readers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Lewis' time aboard the Hyperion encourages him
to cast The New New Thing as an adventure story. But that story
line is not Clark's, but Lewis'.
</P>
<P>
   That is, the adventure story here is the daring journalist
tracking his quarry. Clark himself is fairly bored with the
adventures Lewis details, and his exploits, finally, add up to
armchair adventure, but old-fashioned tale of revenge.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, each of Clark's most recent new new things
follows the not-in-any-respect new entrepreneurial convention of
founding a company to solve a circumstance the entrepreneur finds
aggravating.
</P>
<P>
   Clark came up with Healtheon (an Internet company that seeks to
eliminate all the wasteful paperwork in the health care industry),
after a stay in the hospital. He announced myCFO.com (a Web-based
service to run all of one's personal finances) when he realized
accountants were running too much of his life.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, he started these firms to avenge the bureaucrats and
money-minders who waste his time _ by using the Internet to put
them out of a job.
</P>
<P>
   But these are merely two examples of Clark's penchant for
revenge. To read ``The New New Thing'' is to encounter a man
straight out of Ayn Rand who has done the most good by being
selfish, stubborn, bold.
</P>
<P>
   He is the poor kid who makes a ton of money to show the world he
cannot be denied. He is the crapped-upon Navy recruit who ends up
schooling others in math.
</P>
<P>
   He is the incredibly talented engineer who now gets a pound of
flesh from the financiers who wrested control of his first company
away from him. He is the business titan who proves that the venture
capitalists everyone thinks are so powerful are really just
squirrels after his nuts.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the contradiction that defines Jim Clark: He is
someone who, as Lewis strains to prove, only cares about the
future, but who is steadfastly motivated by what's befallen him in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   Clark wasn't just programming a sailboat in that office above
Jenny Craig; he was plotting his revenge.

 &HT;    Players split over NHL visor issueBy Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ray Ferraro has worn a plastic eye shield throughout
his 16-year NHL career. But don't count him among those in favor of
making visors mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the worst thing hockey could do,'' the Atlanta
Thrashers' 35-year-old center said. ``Respect for each other
already has broken down in the NHL, and part of the reason is that
players have no fear anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't control their sticks,'' Ferraro said, ``and its
because they grown up thinking they are invincible. Hockey can be a
dangerous game. You need to learn to play it right. With shields
and other things, players don't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Visors are required now in Canadian junior hockey and full face
cages in United States college hockey. But most players disgard the
seemingly essential protection when they turn pro.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the possibility of losing an eye because of a flying
puck or high stick, only about 15 percent of NHL players wear
visors The only Thrashers who do are Ferraro and rookie Patrik
Stefan.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro began wearing a shield after he was cut twice _ once
below the eye and once above _ by a stick during his last season of
junior hockey, which then did not require visors.
</P>
<P>
   When he was drafted by the Hartford Whalers, Ferraro decided to
keep the shield, risking being labeled soft by veteran NHL players
who were then just getting used to having to wear helmets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Helmets should be mandatory,'' Ferraro said. ``But I think it
should be a personal choice on visors. If you have an eye injury,
of course you should wear one. But (visors) aren't for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Players say shields are hot and sometimes obstruct vision. But
it mainly remains a macho thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighters just don't wear shields,'' Thrashers enforcer Matt
Johnson said. ``That's just the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting someone with a shield on really messes up your
hands,'' feisty Denny Lambert said. ``Sounds stupid, but in
juniors, players take off their helmets before they start
punching.''
</P>
<P>
   ``European players are more likely to wear eye shields than
North Americans. The top four scorers in the NHL last season _
Jaromire Jagr, Teemu Selanne, Paul Kariya and Peter Forsberg _ all
wore visors. All but Kariya are European.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wore one and didn't see why I should take it off,''
said Stefan, a Czech who was the No. 1 overall pick in the NHL
entry draft in June. ``No one (on the ice) has said anything to me
about wearing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Czechs who were with the Thrashers early in the season wore
eye shields, but that didn't keep Vladimir Vujtek from suffering a
serious cut on the side of the face when struck by a skate during
an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   An eye shield would have prevented an injury to Vancouver
defenseman Mattias Ohlund, who suffered a bruised right eyeball
when struck by a puck during a preseason game. He still is
experiencing blurred vision and isn't expected to be ready to play
until January.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, New York Islanders prospect Jeff Libby lost an eye
when slashed by a skate. The minor-leaguer who caused the injury
lost most of the vision in an eye later in the season when hit by a
stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it's smart not to wear (a visor),''
Philadelphia's Eric Lindros said last season. ``We're all stupid
for not wearing them.''
</P>
<P>
   But players still resist. Atlanta defenseman Gord Murphy had to
wear a shield briefly last season after breaking his nose while
with Florida, but he discarded it as soon as he could. Lambert
suffered a 30-stitch cut between his eyes while in the minors and
wore a visor only a minimum amount of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the puck and sticks, it is unbelievable how few times you
are hit in the face,'' Thrashers coach Curt Fraser said. ``I didn't
even lose a tooth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fraser did suffer a broken eye orbit and cheekbone while
playing for Chicago in the mid-1980s. He wore a guard for only two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't right for a player like me to wear one,'' said
Fraser, a noted fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Fraser says players should be concerned about their eyes. But
like Ferraro, he is not in favor of universal visors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stick work used to be under control,'' Fraser said. ``Now you
have broken wrists, fingers, everything. Players don't fear
retaliation. That's the problem I have with face masks. Some
players act a lot tougher than they really are with them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way that the NHL will require visors is if someone
loses an eye,'' Thrashers captain Kelly Buchberger said. ``This is
a business and money talks. It will be a liability question. I hope
that never happens.''

<P>
   March 27 was John Allen's last good day. He had been
semicomatose in the days leading up to his heart transplant
surgery, but now the transplant was working well and he was alert
and communicative. ``He was his old self,'' recalled his wife,
Sandy, a psychiatric nurse, who lives in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   There was, though, a troubling part of his recovery: the
inability of his doctors to wipe out a type of antibiotic-resistant
staph infection, usually spread on the hands of health care
workers. But Sandy Allen says that when she returned home that day,
she was hopeful her husband might soon be coming home himself. The
next day she got a call from one of his doctors. John Allen, 52,
the father of two teen-agers, was dead, killed by septic shock, an
overwhelming infection of the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sure way of knowing exactly how Allen picked up this
hospital-based infection. But if years of studies of health care
workers are right, two things are certain. First, most of the
people who treated him during his hospitalization would swear they
had washed their hands before they touched him. And second, many of
them would be fooling themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands are the most dangerous thing in the hospital,'' said Dr.
Robert A. Weinstein, director of infectious diseases for the Cook
County Bureau of Health Services in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That unclean hands can transmit germs is not news to anyone who
attended nursery school. More than 150 years ago a Hungarian
physician, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, discovered that ``childbed
fever,'' the infection that routinely killed women who had just
given birth, was being spread on his colleagues' bacteria-laden
hands. Yet a recent study _ conducted at the Duke University
Medical Center and published last month in The Lancet, a medical
journal _ found that only 17 percent of physicians treating
patients in an intensive care unit washed their hands
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Research reported in The Annals of Internal Medicine this year
found that the lowest rates of compliance in a hospital were among
the busy staff members in a high-risk intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5
percent of the people admitted to hospitals, about 1.8 million
patients a year, will pick up an infection there. The infections
cost $4.5 billion to treat, the CDC estimates, and it says better
infection control could have prevented one-third of those cases.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty thousand will die as a direct result of contracting an
infection in the hospital; by contrast, 17,171 Americans died of
AIDS in 1998. And hospital-acquired infections will contribute to
the deaths of 70,000 people, far more than the 44,190 Americans who
died of breast cancer in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is getting worse. Though hospital stays are shorter
and less frequent than they were 20 years ago, today's patients are
generally sicker and more vulnerable. As a result, in the last two
decades the rate of hospital-acquired infection has risen 36
percent. And the danger has intensified in recent years with the
rise of new strains of common microbes that are resistant to
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Take staphylococcus aureus, the infection contracted by John
Allen. It is carried by about 30 percent of adults with no ill
effect. But a strain that has emerged in hospitals is resistant to
methicillin, the most effective antibiotic used against it. Known
as MRSA, the strain is most commonly spread on the hands of health
care workers who pick up the microbes on one patient and pass them
to another; about 80,000 patients a year contract it.
</P>
<P>
   When the organism causes pneumonia or gets into the bloodstream
of someone with lowered resistance, it can be lethal. This decade
has seen the emergence of a number of similar hospital-based
mutants spread hand by hand to patient after patient.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said Dr. Elaine Larson, a professor at the
Columbia University School of Nursing, ``I think health care
professionals wonder if it really is as important as everybody
says.
</P>
<P>
   The unpredictable and largely untraceable nature of these
infections also helps keep workers from feeling responsible for any
given case, said Larson, who has researched hand-washing practices.
``Let's say you decided you didn't need to wash your hands today
and a patient doesn't get an infection for a week. By then they're
out of the hospital, so there's very little link.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no national regulatory requirements for hand-washing
practices at hospitals, clinics and doctors' offices. But the
Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology
recommends a vigorous soaping of 10 to 15 seconds, followed by a
thorough rinse with water before and after contact with body
secretions, mucous membranes or blood.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Jarvis, chief of the Investigation and Prevention
branch of the Hospital Infections Program at the CDC, recommends
washing hands before and after casual patient contact. He says
patients who have no visible signs of infection may be colonized
with potentially dangerous antibiotic-resistant microbes. ``We
don't know who's colonized or who's not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But complying with these recommendations could mean dozens to
hundreds of hand washings a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to The British Medical Journal challenging
recommendations like Jarvis', Dr. Andrew Weeks, a gynecologist,
wrote that if such compelling evidence existed for the need to wash
hands between each patient contact, ``then why do I and the vast
majority of my colleagues not do it?'' He added, ``I have never
seen any convincing evidence that hand washing between each patient
contact reduces infection rates.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Abdul Zafar, now the director of infection control at
Prince George's Hospital Center in Maryland, has witnessed a
significant outbreak of resistant infections, which he attributed
to inadequate hand-washing. When Zafar worked in Virginia, the
cases developed in the newborn nursery: 22 infants contracted
severe skin infections over the course of three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bacteria cannot jump or fly,'' Zafar said. ``It was
transferred hand to hand from a health care worker.'' The outbreak
ended only when the hospital obtained antibacterial soap that
smelled good and did not dry out the skin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis was co-author of a report in The Annals of Internal
Medicine this summer about an effort to reduce the incidence of a
hospital-acquired, antibiotic resistant bloodstream infection among
hospitalized cancer patients. Health care workers were monitored to
make sure they were following all guidelines for isolation and
infection control, including hand washing. The incidence of the
infection was reduced by four-fifths.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such evidence, other studies continue to show inadequate
compliance with washing guidelines. Reasons include lack of time,
inaccessible sinks, rough paper towels and chapped hands from
excessive washing. Larson says the nature of hand washing itself _
it is tedious, repetitive and low-tech _ makes it unappealing.
``It's more exciting to put in a cardiac bypass machine than wash
your hands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If efforts to get people to wash their hands fail, gloves can
help solve the problem. Experts agree that proper glove use works.
But in a demonstration of the law of unintended consequences,
because health care workers feel protected, they often engage in
reckless behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of glove use in a long-term care center, researchers
found that gloves were worn 82 percent of the time when their use
was indicated, but changed appropriately only 16 percent of the
time. And a 1997 study in The Journal of Infection Control and
Hospital Epidemiology found that 42 percent of hospital personnel
who touched only the surfaces of the rooms of contaminated patients
ended up with drug-resistant microbes on their gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of health care workers see gloves as protecting
themselves,'' said Weinstein, of Cook County. ``They put them on at
the beginning of the day and don't take them off, which is the same
as not washing your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a continuing outbreak, there are few
incentives for hospitals to monitor their infection rates
aggressively. In an era of cost containment, Jarvis said, infection
control departments are under pressure to have fewer staff members
because hospital administrators see them as a revenue drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't do good surveillance,'' he said, ``you don't
detect infections, which means they don't exist and you look
great.'' The CDC does not require reporting of hospital-acquired
infections; the agency tracks estimated rates through a voluntary
and confidential program involving about 200 hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Even the people who are paying to treat the infections are not
trying to force changes in behavior. ``Right now we're not trying
to do anything about it,'' said Dr. Lee N. Newcomer, a senior vice
president at UnitedHealth Group, a managed care company.
``Hospitals say they are paying attention to this, and I'm sure
many are, but if they're not succeeding, no one cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Nielsen, senior vice president for quality leadership at
the American Hospital Association, though acknowledging that hand
washing fell below the ideal, disagreed with Newcomer's assessment.
``Hospital are aware of the danger and are doing everything they
can to prevent infection,'' Neilsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Larson sees great promise in the possible adoption of waterless,
alcohol-based antimicrobial hand rubs, which are widely used in
hospitals in Europe. She says studies show they are just as
effective as hand washing but faster to use and gentler than soap
and water.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Maryanne McGuckin, a senior research investigator at the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, wants to turn her
concentration from health care workers to the people who really
care if the hands that touch them are contaminated: the patients.
She has designed a program that gives information packages on the
importance of hand washing to all patients being admitted to the
hospital. Then the patients are instructed to ask each health care
worker who comes into the room, ``Did you wash your hands?''

USING OXYGEN TO EASE ANESTHESIA NAUSEA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Calif., S.C., Ill.) (nk) 
 By NANCY BETH JACKSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patients often wake up from general anesthesia with nausea and
vomiting, but researchers say they can sharply reduce the incidence
of these symptoms with a relatively simple step: increasing the
amount of oxygen given to surgery patients.
</P>
<P>
   The reductions are especially important now that many patients
who might once have stayed in the hospital after surgery are
treated as outpatients.
</P>
<P>
   In the atmosphere, air has almost four times as much nitrogen as
oxygen, and surgery patients usually are given 30 percent oxygen
and 70 percent nitrogen; the mix is richer in oxygen than regular
air because patients breathe less efficiently during surgery. But
in a double-blind random study of 231 patients at two Vienna
hospitals, Dr. Daniel Sessler, a professor at the University of
California in San Francisco, and his colleagues found that the
frequent side effects of general anesthesia could be diminished by
giving patients even more oxygen: a mix of 80 percent oxygen and 20
percent nitrogen during the surgery and for two hours afterward.
Only 17 percent of the patients receiving supplemental oxygen
experienced nausea and vomiting, compared with 30 percent of the
group who were given the usual amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mechanism remains unclear,'' Sessler said, but he added,
``The take-home message from the new studies is that extra oxygen
is cheap, risk-free and reduces the incidence of nausea as well as
any known drug.''
</P>
<P>
   The study, reported in the current issue of Anesthesiology,
focused on patients, 18 to 80 years old, after elective colon
surgery. A related study by members of Sessler's team, published in
the journal last month, indicated that patients given oxygen in
amounts up to 80 percent did not suffer impaired lung function.
</P>
<P>
   Nausea and vomiting can accompany other types of surgery,
including abdominal surgeries and procedures involving the middle
ear and the eye. As many as seven people in 10 experience these
side effects after general anesthesia, Sessler said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary R. Haynes, an anesthesiologist at Medical University of
South Carolina who has studied the side effects, notes that
children, adolescents and pregnant women are particularly affected.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with post-operative nausea and vomiting has become a
critical issue for anesthesiologists as outpatient surgery has
increased in recent years. Beyond the question of patient comfort
is concern for complications like pneumonia, dehydration and
retching that can open sutures, leading to infection. And even a
few extra hours in an outpatient clinic can increase the cost of
surgery. In addition, the symptoms may occur after the patient has
left the clinic, Haynes said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey L. Apfelbaum, vice chairman for anesthesiology and
critical-care medicine at the University of Chicago, said the study
was ``excellent'' but urged caution because of its size and because
the problems are caused by ``a lot of different things.''
</P>
<P>
   The study was paid for by the National Institutes of Health, the
Joseph Drown Foundation and several Austrian grants.

   Scorpion Venom
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the toxicity of the scorpion's sting related to its size?
</P>
<P>
   A. Scorpion experts have found that scorpion species with
smaller and more slender claws typically have more toxic venom,
according to the International Toxin and Venom Data Base. However,
just as with bee stings, any scorpion's sting can be potentially
fatal to a person who is severely allergic to it.
</P>
<P>
   The toxicity of the venom also varies by species and prey. A
species' particular cocktail may contain many chemicals, some aimed
at insects and some toxic only to mammals.
</P>
<P>
   The different chemicals cause many different kinds of damage and
symptoms. Some merely produce pain and swelling and are believed to
be protective in nature. Some, used for killing prey, cause severe
neurological damage by blocking chemical channels in nerve cells.
Some cause direct damage to the the heart muscle. In humans, the
toxic effects can lead to respiratory paralysis, extremely high
body temperatures, dangerously low or high blood pressure, a rapid
heartbeat, etc.
</P>
<P>
   The stings of most American scorpion species are not usually
fatal; for example, the Arizona Poison and Drug Information Center
says that only one of the 30 species of scorpions found in the
state is regarded as life-threatening. However, stings are much
more perilous for children and infants.

NEW AOL MESSENGER ALLOWS INTERNET TALK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Instant Messenger on America Online allows users to type
messages to one another while on the AOL network. Using America
Online Instant Messenger, users who aren't on the AOL network can
send instant messages, too.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, AOL introduced a beta version of the AIM program: AIM
3.5. It is also known as AIM Talk. Using a microphone and headset,
users can talk back and forth just as they would if they were on
the telephone. The sounds won't be ``pin-drop clear,'' but not much
is lost in the Internet imitator of the telephone. Then again,
``Watson, come here, I need you'' sounded pretty scratchy in the
early days, too. Things will improve.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``talk'' box on this version allows users to control
volume. It also can send images, much in the same way that files
can be attached to e-mail. The image, however, opens automatically
on the other end.
</P>
<P>
   An AOL spokeswoman said the product is only in the beta stage
and _ depending on what problems are encountered and how the users
accept it _ may or may not wind up being an AOL offering in final
form. (Beta is the version of the program that has passed in-house
testing but hasn't been subjected to enough testing for final
distribution.)
</P>
<P>
   But if AOL doesn't offer it, it may not be long before it pops
up somewhere else in the competitive online world.
</P>
<P>
   The AOL Talk beta site has been closed because the company
already has enough participants in the beta-testing program.

   Saitek Offers New Gamepad
</P>
<P>
   Saitek Corp. is mainly noted for its electronic chess games.
It's the company that produces Chess Academy, a stand-alone unit
that offers more than 10 hours of oral instructions on chess rules,
openings and strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The company also makes computer game controllers, too. The
latest offering is the P120 Action Pad, a gameport device for
Windows-based computers. It's pretty simple in its operation. And
while there has been some criticism because it doesn't have bells
and whistles, it also doesn't have the price tag that comes with
them. The P120 costs about $10 or less.
</P>
<P>
   It is shaped like a bat (the kind that hangs from cave ceilings,
not the kind used in baseball) with a small pad that gives
eight-way direction on the pad's left face and four buttons on the
right face. Two trigger buttons are underneath, so the index
fingers fit comfortably over them when the pad is gripped.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-way pad has a place in its center to attach a
mini-joystick. The stick, about an inch or so high, can be stowed
in a small compartment in the controller's base.
</P>
<P>
   The game pad is easy enough to set up and calibrate and the
controls are adequate for many of the popular games on the market.
The little joystick lacks the grip found in a full-size one, but
then again, the $10-or-less price tag should provide some
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   There are no drivers for the device (so it must be programmed
through the Windows' gameport interface), but some are available
for downloading from the Saitek site (www.saitek.com) that allow
better operation of trigger controls.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the current sophisticated games require more buttons
than the P120 has available, but playing many point-and-shoot
games, football sims and other sports games not requiring
fighter-pilot controls, the P120 delivers a product with a bargain
price.

LAST ONE OUT, TURN OFF THE LIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the final seconds of Sunday's 49ers-Steelers
game evaporated into nothingness, one couldn't help but notice that
the 49ers and their fans had done so as well.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only people left in 3WinsInNovember Park were
Pittsburgh fans, roaring their love in the rain as their heroes
completed their unanaesthetized dissection of the locals, 27-6.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if this was Three Rivers Stadium, and the 49ers were
slinking off as humiliated visitors.
</P>
<P>
   And suddenly, it all came clear. Even the Faux Faithful have
given up the ghost. They see only the hopelessness that comes with
a team utterly bereft of ideas _ losing without an inkling of why,
or how to make it stop.
</P>
<P>
   Most amazingly, they're not far wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sitting there at the end wondering, `How did it come
to this?''' linebacker Ken Norton said, genuinely bewildered by the
state of the team with which he had once won a Super Bowl. ``I
wonder, `How did we not see what's been going wrong?'''
</P>
<P>
   These are all good questions, but what makes them real brain
bubblers is that there are no answers. There is no secret plan that
coach Steve Mariucci hasn't tried, no stash of talented players to
magically appear and replace the ones who have generated this
four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just a losing streak. It's a losing streak in which
three of the four losses have been by at least three touchdowns.
It's a losing streak in which the offense has scored twice. It's a
losing streak that has shown that quarterback Jeff Garcia is not
the surprise entry in the Kurt-Warner-Came-From-Nowhere
Sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a losing streak that, were it not for New Orleans, Atlanta
and Cincinnati, might have taken them into the next century. And it
isn't smart to make any assumptions about the Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci plainly is running on E, idea-wise. He had Wade Richey
try a 50-yard field goal in miserable weather when he might not do
it on a nice day. He replaced Garcia with Steve Stenstrom with the
score 20-6 ``because we hoped Steve might give us a spark.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw them combine to complete only 36 percent of their passes,
which hasn't happened to the 49ers since B.B. (Before Bill). He got
166 yards rushing from Charlie Garner, but couldn't use any of it
to create an actual score. He couldn't even hide his bald spot,
which until now had been the best-kept secret in the entire
organization.
</P>
<P>
   But never mind that. Here's your highlight for eternity from
this one: Stenstrom gained more yards receiving than Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Hope? What's to hope for here? The 49ers don't even have the
specter of their glorious past to scare teams with any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Their reputation is now of a team that cannot throw the football
with any reliability, which was the one thing they could cling to
when the running game was wheezing, when the cornerbacks were being
outjumped by tight ends, when the league's contenders were whizzing
past them without even so much as an obscene salute.
</P>
<P>
   They look, well, hopeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``No we're not, we're not,'' said safety and chief public
agonizer Tim McDonald. ``We just have to get back and take care of
the things we need to take care of. We have to work harder. We
won't let this become a habit.''
</P>
<P>
   They look, well, lifeless, and surely clueless.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we practiced well this week,'' Mariucci said, looking like
he couldn't decide whether to cry or drop into the fetal position.
``I don't know ... we work hard, we practice well, we meet well,
but that's not enough. We have to find a way to make it happen on
Sundays.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Practice well?`` ``Meet well?''
</P>
<P>
   Jumping anacondas, has it really come to this? Did the
winningest team of the last two decades turn into a Geico Insurance
outlet when we weren't looking?
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe so. Garner's performance, the one shiny spot in what
was mostly an indistinct mud bog, had all the feel of one of those
Paul Hofer games in the mid-'70s, when the hardscrabble little
fullback would play his heart down to the ventricles while the team
was getting dog-whipped by the Lions or Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, for all the we-gotta-do-better platitudes the
players issued from their league-issue laminated card of Things To
Say When You Have Nothing Else, the 49ers really don't have any
sparkling new concepts to offer. They have no more idea of how to
turn the barge back from the falls than the most drunken schmo
trying to find his car in the parking lot at 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci doesn't know, because he's already tried all the
players he's got. Norton and McDonald don't know, because it's been
years since either of them knew this feeling, and they were young
enough then to think they would have plenty of time to win. The
young players don't know, because they have no links to the glory
days.
</P>
<P>
   All they know now is, they lost ... no, they surrendered their
home park to about 4,000 Steeler fans Sunday. Hope? Unless you know
something the rest of us don't, why bother?

   BOXING

<P>
   BOX-LENNOX _ How has the life of Lennox Lewis changed since his
heavyweight fight with Evander Holyfield last March? In some ways,
it hasn't changed at all - he hasn't earned much respect in the
United States while he's still viewed as champion in Great Britian,
his home country. In other ways, his life has changed tremendously
- he's become the sentimental favorite in the boxing community
after the controversial draw nearly eight months ago. A profile of
Lewis heading into Saturday's heavyweight rematch against
Holyfield. (Bunn, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 25.

<P>
   HKN-VISORS _ In a game with flying pucks and swinging sticks,
why don't more NHL players wear visors? The answer is macho pride.
Players don't want to appear weak or afraid. Only about 15 percent
of NHL players wear eye protection, although all had to in college
or junior hockey. The percentage with the Thrashers is even less.
Two major exceptions are veteran Ray Ferraro and rookie Patrik
Stefan. (Curtright, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 18.

   OLY-ATLANTABID _ ATLANTA _ IOC spokesman who made news around
the world a couple of months ago claiming that Atlanta bidders
``pushed'' favors on IOC members eats his words. Franklin
Servan-Shrieber says in an interview in Atlanta that IOC members
didn't ask for gifts and travels and Atlanta bidders were insistent
with their offers, but their intent was not to bribe. They were
operating in the environment at the time. And he hopes the reforms
voted on in December will bring closure to the whole ugly mess. IOC
survey shows public not discouraged by scandal and still holds
Olympics in high regard. (Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 20.

   WESTWOOD _There was no dancing in the aisles. No screaming and
swooning. After all, this wasn't a rock star strolling onto Royce
Hall's prestigious stage. This was a film and television star who
thought he could sing and dance.
</P>
<P>
   He was right.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a white dinner jacket, black trousers, a mauve lapel
flower, suspenders and red patent leather shoes, John Lithgow
looked most debonair during Sunday's performance at the concert
hall on UCLA's campus.
</P>
<P>
   When he and the orchestra launched into ``Everybody Eats When
They Come to My House,'' from his debut children's album, the crowd
went wild.
</P>
<P>
   This set the pace for the approximately hourlong program
featuring another dozen songs and Lithgow's recitation of the
original poem ``The Remarkable Farkle McBride.''
</P>
<P>
   Lithgow has an easy rapport with his audience, kids and adults
alike. And not only does he sing, he also draws _ and draws well _
to help illustrate some of this songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to come to Royce Hall,'' he remarked. ``It is my second
favorite place to sing in the whole wide world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And what is my favorite place to sing?'' he asked the
audience. ``The bathtub!''
</P>
<P>
   Great introduction to the title track on his CD, ``Singin' in
the Bathtub.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the song everyone most enjoyed was ``I Had a
Rooster,'' with Lithgow's funny and appealing animal impressions. &QL;

trillion revised his estimate downward Monday. But only slightly.
Ken Thorpe says Bradley's plan for near-universal health care
coverage would cost about $1.05 trillion. And he says Bradley's
plan would insure only 89 percent of Americans, not the 95 percent
Bradley claims. In Chicago, Bradley touted his program to public

   ATLANTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering
replacement parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries
for bypass surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete
heart valve has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel
walls in sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
</P>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take

WILL SCIENCE COME TO AID OF GALAPAGOS BACHELOR? TUNE IN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Science Times)  
 (af)  
 By ERIC NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists think they now know why Lonesome George, the
Galapagos Islands' most eligible bachelor, can't seem to have a
meaningful relationship.
</P>
<P>
   George was the only giant Galapagos tortoise found when
scientists from the Charles Darwin Research Station visited his
island, Pinta, in 1971 and came upon a land ravaged by centuries of
trapping and the feral goats, rats and other creatures sailors had
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers, believing him to be the last of his subspecies,
rescued George and took him to their headquarters on the island of
Santa Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, scientists from the Darwin center have bred
2,000 tortoises and set them free on the islands where their
subspecies, decimated by humans, originated. Hoping someday to do
the same for George, they put him in the same living area as female
tortoises of other subspecies. The idea was at least to hone his
social skills should another Pinta tortoise be found.
</P>
<P>
   Reasoning that one can never go wrong with the girl next door,
they chose tortoises from the island of Isabela, which neighbors
Pinta in the northern reaches of the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   But George would have none of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not mating activity or even interest displayed by
George,'' said Dr. Howard Snell, a herpetologist at the Darwin
station.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers worried that perhaps there was something wrong with
the tortoise. ``An alternative hypothesis,'' Snell said, ``is that
George is a discerning Pinta tortoise, and he's not particularly
interested in tortoises that are not of his island.''
</P>
<P>
   Now a new study seems to support that explanation. Researchers
say they were surprised to discover through DNA analysis that
George's closest relatives are not from neighboring Isabela, but
from the islands of San Cristobal and Espanola _ at 180 miles to
the south, the farthest Galapagos islands from Pinta.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Tuesday in Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences, focused not on George but on finding the
genetic origins of all the tortoises. It concludes that the closest
living link to the Galapagos tortoise, or Geochelone nigra, is
probably a relatively small tortoise found in South America.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the Galapagos Islands that Darwin _ fascinated by the
giant tortoises, which can grow to five feet and more than 600
pounds _ developed the theory of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   The new information about George, said Dr. Jeffrey R. Powell of
Yale, an author of the study, suggests that the Darwin station
scientists should consider introducing George to females from San
Cristobal and Espanola. As fate would have it, some are being kept
as part of the breeding population on Santa Cruz only a short
distance from the tortoise's quarters.
</P>
<P>
   But Snell said that while that might happen, it would not be any
time soon. Scientists first want to continue efforts to find a true
Pinta female for George, so his subspecies can be preserved, and
this could take several years. (George is believed to be at least
50; Galapagos tortoises can live more than 150 years.)
</P>
<P>
   They are renewing a search for other tortoises on Pinta, which,
thanks to a goat eradication program, is once again lush. Using the
DNA analysis, they will also seek to see whether any female
tortoises in captivity elsewhere are from Pinta.
</P>
<P>
   For scientists at the center, the main issue is not, as Snell
put it, ``George's well-being as an individual,'' but what will
best help restore the ecology of the Galapagos. The Darwin center
is reluctant to pair George with a San Cristobal or Espanola female
from the breeding program, because that would slow the tortoise
repopulation efforts and yield offspring of questionable value.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if scientists decide that reintroducing even
a mixed subspecies of tortoise onto Pinta would help the island's
ecology, they will consider trying again to find George a mate.

 &HT;    Health care questions creating divide between candidates
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington _ The fault line between Vice President Al Gore and
presidential rival Bill Bradley over health care reform widened
Monday as each sought to undercut the other on a crucial issue for
Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Bradley told a meeting of public health
professionals that Gore abandoned health care reform after the
Clinton administration lost a fight for universal care in 1994.
Bradley criticized Gore while outlining a proposal to invest $2
billion in public health, including a $1 billion infusion to the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gore appeared at a pharmacy to propose new laws
that would make cheaper, generic drugs more readily available to
consumers. Gore's campaign also trumpeted a new study by an Emory
University expert that found Bradley's proposal for near-universal
health care insurance would be more expensive than he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of what to do about the nation's 46 million
uninsured has become the primary point of friction between the two
Democrats since their first town hall meeting nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-New Jersey senator largely dismissed Gore's criticisms of
his health care plan as partisan snipping, but on Monday Bradley
shifted tactics and went on the offensive. He accused Gore of
falling victim to the ``Beltway perspective . . . that (says) if
you try something once and fail, move on to another issue that
polls better or is safer to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley even used some of Gore's rhetoric against him. When the
candidates appeared together in Iowa last month, Gore accused
Bradley of abandoning the Democratic Party and refusing to ``stay
and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of health care, Al Gore decided it wasn't worth
standing and fighting,'' Bradley told members of the American
Public Health Association. ``He abandoned that fundamental
Democratic principle of basic health care for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he added, ``The lesson Al Gore learned from the health
care defeat was that big, bold things can't get done in Washington,
so let's look to the small, symbolic things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Gore issued a statement accusing Bradley of
offering a ``flawed trillion dollar plan that will cost the
American people even more in the long run.'' Gore renewed his
challenge to debate Bradley, ending with, ``How about it, Bill?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign found fresh ammunition to attack Bradley's
proposal to cover uninsured Americans by subsidizing their premiums
in the private network of insurers covering federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Emory public health specialist Ken Thorpe, who two weeks ago
estimated that Bradley's proposal would cost $1.2 trillion over 10
years, on Monday downgraded his estimate to $1.06 trillion, taking
into account offsets suggested by the Bradley campaign. He
estimated Bradley's plan would cost $78.9 billion in the first
year, as compared to Bradley's own estimate of $55-$65 billion.
Altogether, Thorpe estimated Bradley's plan would provide health
insurance to 15 million new uninsured and cover 89 percent of
Americans. Gore's plan, at an estimated cost of $312 billion over
10 years, would insure 12.1 new Americans and cover 88 percent of
the population, Thorpe said. Bradley's campaign said Thorpe was
biased because he was a health care adviser to the Clinton-Gore
administration from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Thorpe has never been the authority on health care,'' said
Kristan Ludecke, Bradley's spokeswoman.

ECUADOREAN RESORT RESEMBLES GHOST TOWN AS VOLCANO RUMBLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: A tilde is needed over n in Banos) 
 
By JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANOS, Ecuador _ The threat of a deadly eruption from nearby
Tungurahua volcano has turned one of Ecuador's most lively tourist
resorts into an eerie no man's land.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing disaster, the government last month ordered the
evacuation of Banos, a town of 18,000 nestled at the foot of
Tungurahua. Famous for its hot springs, Banos is also the jumping
off point for hiking, rafting and bicycle tours.
</P>
<P>
   But during a recent visit, hotels, restaurants and houses stood
padlocked. To protect their homes from lava, residents blocked one
street with sandbags. Officials even drained the town's thermal
baths. And about the only sounds came from abandoned dogs and cats
prowling the deserted neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just us and the ghosts,'' said Elias Murguizu, a Spanish
priest and one of a handful of people allowed to stay behind. ``We
have our cars ready to go in case of an emergency.``
</P>
<P>
   Active for centuries, the 16,278-foot Tungurahua began rumbling
anew five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, it spits up tons of lava, sulfuric gases and ash. Some
of the rocks are the size of automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Plumes of gray smoke have often reached three miles above the
crater, and lava has spilled half-way down Tungurahua's cone. The
surrounding area has been placed under an ``orange alert,'' meaning
that an eruption could occur within hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``A huge eruption could happen at any moment,'' said Pablo
Samaniego, a volcanologist at the Institute of Geophysics in Quito.
Rivers of lava, mud and water could crash into Banos within
minutes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Banos' frightened residents were anxious to clear out.
They moved in with relatives or settled in government shelters just
outside the alert zone. Army troops then set up roadblocks to
cordon off the town.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that no one knows how long the threat will last.
Geologists say Tungurahua could blow tomorrow, next week or even
next year. Banos will remain off limits until the volcanic activity
dies down. Impatient evacuees now are beginning to feel like
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel and restaurant owners complain that the policy will kill
off tourism and force them out of business. Artisans, shop keepers
and farmers of Banos wonder how they will find new jobs in the
midst of Ecuador's worst recession since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the eruption would happen immediately and that we
would be back in a few days,'' said Wilson Lara, who fled Banos
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Rosario Vallejo, a candymaker who moved into a shelter in
Ambato, 18 miles northwest of Banos, said families have been told
that they may be in limbo for up to a year. ``We are tired and
traumatized,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Farther north, hundreds more have been evacuated from the slopes
of Guagua Pichincha volcano on the outskirts of the capital city of
Quito.
</P>
<P>
   Following an eruption last month that formed a huge mushroom
cloud, Quito was covered with ash. Street venders sold surgical
face masks, and the congestion forced officials to order the
temporary closure of the city's international airport.
</P>
<P>
   Although a major eruption of Guagua Pichincha may be imminent,
geologists say that it poses little danger to Quito because the
crater points away from the city.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Tungurahua has plagued Banos for centuries.
According to Samaniego, an eruption in 1773 destroyed much of the
original community and led to the relocation of the town.
</P>
<P>
   Portraits of a fire-spewing Tungurahua decorate the Banos
cathedral. One painting depicts the Roman Catholic faithful
carrying the image of the Virgin toward the erupting volcano, an
act that is said to have silenced Tungurahua and saved the town.
</P>
<P>
   Following its last major eruption in 1918, author Nicolas
Martinez described the burning lava that flowed into the rivers
adjacent to Banos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat was so intense that I could not cross the streams for
four days,'' Martinez wrote at the time. ``You could light
cigarettes on the rocks and if you stuck a piece of wood into the
sand, it would be charred in an instant.``
</P>
<P>
   Yet many dismiss the danger.
</P>
<P>
   Murguizu, the Spanish priest, said that a steep mountain ridge
located between Banos and the volcano protects the town and
insisted that there is no record of deaths or substantial damage
caused by Tungurahua.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never done anything. In all of the past eruptions, the
lava has gone out into the river,'' he said. ``I sleep
peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   But Army Col. Alejandro Recalde, who is coordinating emergency
efforts and monitoring the volcano from Ambato, said that
conditions have changed since 1918.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, he said, Banos is much larger, making the
outlying neighborhoods vulnerable. He added that lava could cut off
the main roads leading out of Banos and turn a last-minute
evacuation into chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``People may think that we are taking too many precautions, but
it is important to remember history,'' said Recalde.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of recent volcanic catastrophes in
Latin America. Amid the heavy rains of Hurricane Mitch last
October, a crater lake atop La Casita volcano in northern Nicaragua
overflowed. The resulting mudslide killed 2,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Colombia, more than 20,000 people died in 1985
when the snow-capped Nevado del Ruiz volcano erupted, causing a
massive landslide that buried the town of Armero. Survivors said
local officials did not order an evacuation until mud was sweeping
through the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot play with the lives of 20,000 people,'' Samaniego
said.
</P>
<P>
   Others believe the Ecuadorean government may be taking extra
precautions after being stung by criticisms over its slow response
to last year's El Nino weather phenomenon. Rains and flooding
killed 292 and caused nearly $3 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Banos residents are clamoring to go home.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of townsfolk clashed with police last week and tried to
run army roadblocks. To relieve the pressure, convoys of vehicles
under military escort were allowed into Banos for a few hours over
the weekend so people could gather the rest of their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Resch, an Austrian who lives on the outskirts of Banos ,
found his lawn furniture covered with black ash. He collected his
passport, stereo and clean clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he took a last look around and walked away, wondering
aloud if he will still have a home once Tungurahua unleashes its
fury.

U.S. TO LAUNCH TINY SATELLITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN E. LEARY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The concept of less being more will take on new
meaning in space next month when the Air Force launches a fleet of
tiny experimental satellites made of miniature components _
diminutive machines that could one day work together in groups to
replace or supplement larger spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   Driven by economics and the desire to approach working in space
in a different way, researchers are exploring methods to make and
use midget spacecraft _ some weighing less than a pound and hardly
larger than a pack of playing cards _ that could be used alone to
perform simple tasks or flown in formations to execute more complex
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in tiny satellites that can distribute the duties and
risks of working in space has grown with advances in
microtechnology that are reducing the size of machines and
components. For example, rapid improvements in
microelectromechanical systems, or MEMS, are allowing researchers
to produce switches, valves, levers, gears and other machine
components that are too small to be seen by the human eye. Space
engineers say they are harnessing such elements to make bantam
satellites with techniques similar to those used to produce
computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to one day build a satellite on a chip,'' said Dr.
Siegfried W. Janson, a senior scientist with The Aerospace Corp., a
private research organization in El Segundo, Calif. ``We're talking
about fully integrated satellites that could be mass produced
cheaply by the hundreds and sent into space in groups to perform a
variety of tasks.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellites are generally classified by weight, with standard
ones weighing a ton or more, small satellites coming in between 200
pounds and a ton, and microsats considered those that fall between
20 pounds and 200 pounds. The new wave of smaller satellites that
engineers see for the future are so-called nanosatellites ranging
from 20 pounds down to 2 pounds, and picosatellites that weigh in
at less than 2 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Janson said he envisioned producing satellites weighing as
little as half a pound that are assembled from layered silicon
wafers containing sensors, computing power, communications systems,
mechanical devices and even micro rocket thrusters. Swarms of such
satellites, launched together on single, inexpensive rockets, could
replace more expensive single satellites for some tasks, he said,
or spread out to take on entirely new roles in space.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to low cost, networks composed of dozens, if not
hundreds, of inexpensive tiny satellites could offer a new standard
of reliability, proponents say. If one or several of the machines
in a formation fails, others in the group could redistribute
themselves and continue performing the assigned task, they say,
something not possible with a single-satellite mission.
</P>
<P>
   Peter V. Panetta of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in
Greenbelt, Md., agrees, saying there is growing interest in
increasingly smaller satellites and other spacecraft. ``This isn't
just a fad,'' he said. ``A lot of people see this as the future and
are working toward the technical breakthroughs to make these things
possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Panetta, manager of NASA's Nanosat Technology Development
Program, said the agency hoped to have a constellation of 100
nanosatellites, weighing as little as 2 pounds each, launched by
one rocket on a single mission in 2008. This approach would be
ideal for science missions requiring measurements to be taken
simultaneously from many locations, he said, such as monitoring the
amount of solar radiation absorbed by, and then reflected from, the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   As a step toward the goal of flying formations of nanosats, NASA
announced in August that it would sponsor the Nanosat Constellation
Trailblazer mission. This flight of three, 40-pound microsats,
scheduled for 2003, will test MEMS technology, formation flying and
methods of operating several spacecraft as a system to pave the way
for future nanosat clusters, Panetta said.
</P>
<P>
   Formations of nanosats could be the only way to study certain
phenomenon, he said, such as the dynamics of the magnetosphere, the
area around the Earth that traps high-energy particles from the sun
in the planetary magnetic field. This moving, tear-shaped region
extends more than 150,000 miles from the Earth in the direction
away from the sun, he said, and only a network of satellites could
constantly monitor its changes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark E. Campbell of the University of Washington in Seattle
recently completed a NASA-sponsored study of possible deep space
missions for clusters of pico or nano-sized spacecraft. Among the
possibilities, he said, are teams of semi-autonomous craft that
could swarm around asteroids or comets to make measurements and
then assemble themselves into a communications array to send the
results back to Earth. Another possibility is to send a mother ship
to a planet that would release orbiting picosats that would slowly
drift down through its atmosphere and send data back to Earth via
the mother craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that it will take 15 to 20 years to put together a
system like this, but this is where the technology is heading,''
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers also envision jobs for single midget satellites, like
launching one along with each expensive, large spacecraft. If a
problem arose with the main spacecraft, the tiny satellite buddy
could detach and examine the larger ship to help ground controllers
diagnose and fix the difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   To test the concept of midget satellites in space, several
picosats are scheduled to be launched into Earth orbit early next
month on the inaugural launching of a new Air Force booster rocket.
The rocket, formally called the Orbital/Suborbital Program Space
Launch Vehicle but nicknamed Minotaur, uses the first two stages of
decommissioned Minuteman II intercontinental ballistic missiles and
upper stages from Orbital Sciences Corporation's commercial Pegasus
rocket. The Air Force hopes to use surplus ICBM's as a cheap way to
launch small government payloads.
</P>
<P>
   Among Air Force and university payloads offered a free ride on
the first flight is the Orbiting Picosat Automated Launcher, or
OPAL, built by students from Stanford University. The OPAL mother
ship is to fire off a half dozen pico-sized daughter satellites,
including a pair built by the Aerospace Corp. and the Pentagon's
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The two battery-powered satellites in this pair, each weighing
about a half-pound and slightly larger than a pack of playing
cards, are to be connected by a 100-foot tether to keep them from
drifting too far apart to communicate with one another. The
satellites will spend several days communicating with one another
and with a third picosat at a ground station to see how they
operate as a system, and testing an array of experimental MEMS
radio switches.
</P>
<P>
   The tether between the craft contains a gold wire to help
Earth-based radar track the tiny objects, which raises the issue of
old picosats becoming space debris that could damage other craft
through space collisions.
</P>
<P>
   Panetta of NASA said designers were aware of the potential
problem with the tiny, hard-to-follow spacecraft and see it as an
issue to address in mission design. One approach, he said, is to
put nano-thrusters on Earth-orbiting satellites that could be fired
at the end of a mission to slow the craft enough to fall out of
orbit and burn up in the atmosphere. ``You don't want the solution
to one problem to create another,'' he said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 106-degree fever with teeth-clenching chills would
frighten anyone, and when the cause cannot be identified quickly
such symptoms are even more alarming.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly two weeks beginning in late October, Sean Cavanaugh,
a 30-year-old artist in Manhattan, had fevers that spiked to 104
and 106 degrees. Last week, his doctors diagnosed malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Each year millions of people in Third World countries develop
similar symptoms from malaria, a parasitic infection carried by the
anopheles mosquito, and many die. Far fewer cases occur in the
United States, and almost all patients here survive, as Cavanaugh
did.
</P>
<P>
   But where he got malaria is a matter of contention. Did he
contract it on Long Island where two 11-year-old Boy Scouts were
infected in August? Or did he get it on a springtime visit to
Honduras, where the infection is common, even though he took
anti-malarial drugs and never experienced symptoms suggestive of
malaria until late last month?
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the case underscores the importance of diagnosing
once-common infections like malaria that are now rare in the United
States. Earlier this century, malaria infected half a million
Americans each year. Now all but about 10 cases reported here each
year are in Americans who contracted malaria while overseas or in
people who moved to the United States from areas where the
infection remains.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the infection in the United States came from getting
rid of the parasite with drugs, not from eliminating the anopheles
mosquito.
</P>
<P>
   Cavanaugh said his first symptom was ``a run-down feeling'' that
began on Oct. 22, which he attributed to stress surrounding the
opening of his art show at a gallery the previous night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had just been the center of attention and talking to 200
people, so I felt I should feel run down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 23, Cavanaugh took guests to the Brooklyn Museum and to
his show at the Long Fine Art Gallery in Manhattan. He intended to
meet friends for dinner but returned home for a nap instead. ``I
put my head on the pillow, and as I was falling asleep the pillow
felt like it was burning up, because my head was so hot,'' he said.
His temperature was above 104.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning his temperature was normal, but he felt tired
and had no appetite. Cavanaugh said he ``thought it was just going
to be a 24-hour thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Oct. 27, while working at the Milton Avery Trust, he
suddenly felt cold and started shaking violently, and his fever
reappeared. ``That was really scary,'' he said, ``and the time to
go to my doctor.''
</P>
<P>
   His doctor, James Salik, ``thought it was probably a virus that
would go away in a couple of days, and that reassured me,''
Cavanaugh said.
</P>
<P>
   Then shortly after awakening on Oct. 29, he was shaking again.
His temperature was 106.1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never been sicker than that in my life, not even
close,'' he said. ``My girlfriend put me in a tub of cold water
because I was afraid my brain was going to start boiling.''
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Salik referred Cavanaugh to Dr. David Silverman,
an expert in infectious diseases at New York University. Both
doctors asked the same question: Where have you traveled recently?
Honduras in the spring, Cavanaugh told them.
</P>
<P>
   Between the fevers, Cavanaugh told friends that he identified
with malaria victims he had seen in the movies, ``shaking
uncontrollably and teeth chattering.''
</P>
<P>
   But he dismissed the notion of malaria because his doctors felt
that the seven months since his trip to Honduras was too long an
interval for the illness to be malaria, and he had not been in
another infected area. Silverman said, ``We kept figuring this is
some sort of bizarre viral thing that will probably just go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend of Oct. 30 and 31, Cavanaugh's temperature
hovered around 100.5 and he felt much better; by Nov. 1, he
thought, ``This is over.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2:30 a.m. on Nov. 2, the fever and shaking chills returned.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors were perplexed. Initially, the doctors focused on
the possibility of endocarditis, a potentially fatal infection of
the lining of the heart, because treatment is most effective if
given in its earliest stages. But Cavanaugh had none of the risk
factors for endocarditis, like a damaged heart valve, recent dental
work or invasive medical procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman said he wondered whether Cavanaugh was developing
hepatitis, because a urine test showed traces of bile, a pigment
made in the liver. (As it turned out, the bile resulted from the
destruction of red blood cells by malaria parasites.)
</P>
<P>
   An ultrasound test showed a normal liver, but it also revealed
an enlarged spleen. That finding and the fever pattern refocused
attention on malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Salik recalled reading about the Boy Scouts who were infected
with malaria while camping on the North Fork of Long Island. But
Cavanaugh had only been on the South Fork, where the disease had
never been reported, Silverman said.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors also considered another parasitic infection,
babesiosis, which is transmitted by ticks and has occurred on
Shelter Island, off eastern Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Silverman ordered tests for malaria and babesiosis at New York
University and sent a sample of Cavanaugh's blood to the Centers
for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   During his illness, Cavanaugh's anxiety rose as he recalled
books and movies about outbreaks of Ebola virus infections in
Africa, and West Nile encephalitis in New York City in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I have some new disease that nobody knows about?'' he said.
``I do not want to be the breakthrough of some new disease.''
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Silverman learned that a laboratory at New
York University had identified Plasmodium vivax, one of the four
types of parasites that cause human malaria, in Cavanaugh's blood.
Silverman double-checked the results and called his patient to tell
him the puzzle was solved: He had malaria.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved to know what was tormenting him, Cavanaugh rushed to a
pharmacy to start anti-malarial therapy.
</P>
<P>
   His temperature and appetite have returned to normal, and
Cavanaugh, who is 6-foot-5 and usually weighs 185 pounds, is trying
to regain the 10 pounds he lost.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still an unsolved mystery: where he contracted the
infection.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Holtz and Dr. Peter Bloland, two CDC malaria
experts, believe Cavanaugh got malaria in Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   ``The probabilities in this case would favor association with
travel to an endemic area where transmission occurs at orders of
magnitude higher than they have ever been in Long Island,'' Bloland
said.
</P>
<P>
   Malaria can recur, even after therapy, and some strains are
resistant to drugs. For these and other reasons, the doctors said,
the agency considers anyone with vivax malaria to have had a
relapse from a primary infection if the person had traveled to an
endemic area within four years before becoming ill. .
</P>
<P>
   Silverman sees it differently. ``CDC is playing a statistics
game. It's a coin toss with Sean,'' he said. ``It is an unlikely
scenario that he got it in Honduras, and it is an unlikely scenario
that he got it on Long Island. But he certainly got it someplace.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cavanaugh said he had been bitten by mosquitoes while he was on
Long Island in late September and early October. ``At a barbecue,
we joked about the encephalitis scare, and how in the modern world
any disease is possible in New York,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mahfouz Zaki, the Suffolk County public health director,
said, ``You have to be a magician to say that this guy did not get
it here or got it there.''
</P>
<P>
   DNA tests can help trace the source and pattern of spread in
outbreaks of some viruses. But similar tests are not available for
malaria, Bloland said.
</P>
<P>
   Zaki, who had extensive experience with malaria in his native
Egypt, said the Long Island cases pointed up the need to be alert
to malaria, which can mimic many diseases, among patients with
fevers in areas from which the parasite was thought to have
disappeared. And Cavanaugh's case illustrates why travelers should
tell their doctors about visits to infected areas.
</P>
<P>
   Most American physicians ``know little about parasitic diseases
and do not look for malaria,'' Zaki said. And sometimes, he said,
physicians may not report new cases or relapses to health
departments, because their patients are illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bet there are many malaria cases here that we know nothing
about,'' Zaki said.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S RULING PARTY RELISHES ELECTION RESULTS, BUT MUST
CONTEND WITH DISSIDENTS
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or
PRI, is celebrating its first-ever presidential primary election as
if it had just given birth to a beautiful new baby.
</P>
<P>
   Winner Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who will go on to compete in
Mexico's July 2000 presidential election, proclaimed ``a new PRI''
after balloting on Sunday. The PRI, which supervised its own
election, claims it attracted as many as 9 million or 10 million
voters _ many more than the 6.5 million the party expected.
</P>
<P>
   The primary represented the first time this century that the
powerful party allowed voters, rather than Mexico's president, to
select the presidential candidate for the PRI, the world's longest
ruling political party.
</P>
<P>
   Even ardent PRI foes who believe the primary was mostly for
show, acknowledge that the balloting helped renovate the PRI's
image as an authoritarian, corrupt dinosaur responsible for
Mexico's chronic economic woes.
</P>
<P>
   Alleging that the media favored Labastida over his rivals and
that public money was used to muster votes, opposition politician
Jose Ortiz Pinchetti said, ``I think the old and the new PRI are
basically the same. But the primary showed that the PRI is still
fantastic at turning out votes . . . It wasn't democracy, but it
showed imagination and a will to take risks.''
</P>
<P>
   But political analysts here also say the PRI _ which has
controlled Mexico's presidency since 1929 _ can't afford to be too
cocky about its chances in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Although the final count has yet to be released, it may show
that Labastida won the primary with barely half the total number of
direct votes cast in the election, said Luis Linares, a political
analyst with Mexico City's Special Investigations Systems. ``That
means that inside the PRI there is a dissident current that is
almost a majority.''
</P>
<P>
   For the 2000 election, Linares said, the PRI can't automatically
count on those dissident votes going over to Labastida. Most
dissident votes were cast for PRI maverick Roberto Madrazo Pintado,
who ran a ferocious campaign against the free-market economic
policies of President Ernesto Zedillo and other party elite.
Labastida was until recently Zedillo's agriculture secretary, and
then his interior minister.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is projected to have won 272 of 300 electoral
districts in Mexico, compared to only 20 for Madrazo. Victory was
based on whoever won the largest number of electoral districts,
rather than popular votes.
</P>
<P>
   With 70 percent of districts counted, Labastida won about 4.1
million direct votes and Madrazo almost 2.3 million. Two other
candidates together won about 795,900 votes. The total vote against
Labastida, with this partial return, was almost 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI's opposition in 2000 is divided between two top
candidates, leftist Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and conservative Vicente
Fox. In some polls Fox is neck-and-neck in popularity with
Labastida. But either opposition candidate could benefit from a
floating bloc of votes not committed to the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Linares pointed out, sentiment against the PRI
has been strong enough that the party hasn't been able to win a big
election like a governor's race with more than about 45 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``So If the PRI doesn't integrate those (dissident primary)
voters, there could be trouble in 2000,'' Linares said.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo will be a key figure in this accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the primary campaign, Madrazo, along with two other
candidates, relentlessly attacked Labastida as the PRI's ``official
candidate'' imposed by the party elite. The rivals also accused
Labastida of benefiting from an old-fashioned PRI election tactic:
the use of public money to buy votes, as well as pressure tactics
by PRI-affiliated governors and other functionaries.
</P>
<P>
   After the PRI handed out official preliminary returns
effectively making Labastida the victor late Sunday night, Madrazo
appeared on Mexican television early Monday morning conceding
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't cry fraud and he announced he would stay with the PRI,
putting to rest, for now, the specter of a potentially damaging
break with the party. But he made it clear he was not going to fall
silent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am proud of have participated in this internal process,
which had imperfections and inequities,'' Madrazo, a former
governor of Tabasco state, said. ``We knew throughout this campaign
we'd be fighting against old party inertia, against resistance. We
will continue fighting inside the party, we will continue leading a
current within the PRI that is looking for change.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel Estudillo, an analyst with the Mexican Institute of
Political Studies, said, Labastida can't ignore Madrazo's crowd
inside the PRI. ``To ignore them, might not be political suicide,''
he said, ``but it would be a big risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Estudillo predicted that the party would be busy over the next
few weeks trying to rein in dissidents by offering some leaders
candidacies for next year's congressional elections. But Labastida
will also have to offer something for those individual voters who
want to see some changes in how the party is run and its policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Labastida told a Mexican television station that he
hoped to meet with Madrazo soon. In his first televised victory
speech early Monday morning, however, Labastida fell short of
inviting his rivals within the party to join his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have concluded a process of open, real, passionate and at
times bitter competition,'' Labastida said. ``That's the way it's
been because that's what competition is.''

   RALEIGH, N.C. _ Now that it's built will they come?
</P>
<P>
   For the brand-new Entertainment and Sports Arena in Raleigh,
there is a lot riding on that question, not the least of which is
the $98 million contributed to the $154 million project by the
North Carolina public.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the public money has come from revenues from a hotel
tax levied on Wake County hotels and from the city of Raleigh and
Wake County governments, and the state General Assembly has
contributed at least $18 million so far.
</P>
<P>
   In an era when multimillion-dollar arenas are nearly obsolete as
soon as they open and middle-class families are increasingly unable
to afford a trip to a ball game, Raleigh's glitzy new arena is
hoping to buck those trends.
</P>
<P>
   When planning started in 1984, it was to be a basketball venue
for North Carolina State University. By the time a groundbreaking
was held nine years later, it had evolved into a multi-purpose
sports arena. Three years later, organizers, led by Raleigh's
mayor, set out to add a professional hockey franchise to the
equation.
</P>
<P>
   The Entertainment and Sports Arena, which opened Oct. 29 just
west of downtown Raleigh, is the new home of the Carolina
Hurricanes, the Research Triangle's first professional sports team.
But, it is more than a hockey rink, according to the people in
charge of filling up the place 365 nights a year. Professional
hockey will take up 41 dates between October and May, which leaves
a lot of blank space on the calendar.
</P>
<P>
   In its first two months, the arena, which seats between 18,000
and 20,000 people, depending on the event, will host a range of
tenants. First off were the Hurricanes, whose NHL match-up with the
New Jersey Devils sold out the arena.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Canes will play 16 games at the arena before the end of the
year, and N.C. State, the other prime user of the facility, will
play eight games as well. All but six of the N.C. State basketball
games are sold out, even though the new arena has 50 percent more
seats than Reynolds Coliseum, the team's former venue.
</P>
<P>
   The arena will have five nights of Disney on Ice in mid-December
and a ``success-in-business'' seminar featuring such luminaries as
talk-show host Larry King, actor Christopher Reeve and Gen. Colin
Powell. Add in World Wrestling Federation matches, women's soccer
exhibitions and four music concerts, including a $125-a-ticket
James Taylor concert on New Year's Eve, and the calendar fills up
pretty quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Raleigh officials say they want to link the arena with other
attractions to make Raleigh a destination for visitors. The new
Exploris museum, an interactive hands-on place, opened last month
in downtown Raleigh, and the N.C. Museum of Natural Sciences will
open in a new building in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally have a big-league team. We're already the
Smithsonian of the South,'' said Martin Armes of the Greater
Raleigh Convention and Visitors Bureau, noting the downtown museums
and the North Carolina Museum of Art, which is currently host to a
Monet art show.
</P>
<P>
   Armes said his office is working to attract large conventions
and religious groups to the arena in an effort to tout Raleigh as
on a tourism par with Nashville and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Travel Industry Association of America, which
tracks visitor spending in major cities, tourists spent about $1.02
billion in Wake County last year, or nearly $2.8 million a day.
``Raleigh's a big market, and this should provide a spark,'' said
Michael Pina, a tourism industry spokesman in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With several new attractions scheduled to open next year and the
arena generating business, Armes said the area ``is still
scratching the surface in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Entertainment and Sports Arena won't be successful if it
does not solve one opening-night problem. Many motorists headed for
the opening face-off sat in traffic for hours as arena officials
underestimated their parking needs.
</P>
<P>
   When the puck dropped around 7:40 p.m. after a light show, a Big
Bad Voodoo Daddy music concert and player introductions, many of
the best seats were empty and stayed that way through the first
period. After the game, arena officials said more parking
attendants would be used, and more lanes would be opened.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a N.C. State basketball scrimmage last week that drew
about 6,000 fans also produced a traffic tie-up.
</P>
<P>
   Solving traffic problems and other headaches is the
responsibility of Gale Force Holdings, which owns the Hurricanes
and has a long-term contract to run the arena as well. The
Hurricanes have a 20-year lease to stay in the arena, but the
public is ultimately responsible for the building. Officially, the
Centennial Authority, a public body that was set up by the state's
General Assembly in 1995 and given $7 million, owns the facility.
</P>
<P>
   A thorny, yet lucrative, issue still to be resolved concerns
what corporate name will be attached to the arena. Industry sources
estimate a naming contract could bring in between $40 million to
$200 million, depending on the length of the commitment.
</P>
<P>
   The state has invested millions, as has N.C. State, which owns
the naming rights. University and arena officials say they are
negotiating over the rights, but for now, the facility is one of
the few new arenas in America without a corporate name attached to
it.

HOG FARMERS EYE NATIONAL COOPERATIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Iowa)  (mk) 
 By SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman sounds the
alarm about consolidation in the farm industry, independent and
small hog farmers, whose ranks have thinned drastically this
decade, are pursuing one option to bolster their strength _ joining
forces to form a national cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   While not yet a reality, the proposed cooperative got a
significant boost in the recent agriculture spending bill, which
commits $500,000 to study the feasibility of the venture.
Supporters believe a national pork cooperative could be up and
running by spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would allow us to create an atmosphere where we would not
only survive, but grow and prosper'' said John Adams, a hog farmer
in Greene County, N.C., who supports the idea. A cooperative, Adams
said, would give hog farmers some economic muscle and control
``from the farm to the fork.''
</P>
<P>
   Glickman likes the idea. In recent months, the agriculture
secretary has talked repeatedly about his concerns that small
farmers are being driven out of business by large operations that
have come to characterize American farming.
</P>
<P>
   ``A giant shadow looms over the ability of independent family
farmers and ranchers to get a fair shake in today's agricultural
economy _ concentration,'' Glickman wrote in one column.
</P>
<P>
   In another speech, Glickman spoke specifically about hog
farmers. ``We don't want hogs to go the way of poultry, where most
of the industry operates under contract,'' he said. In one sense,
Glickman added, such farmers act as employees of the processing
plants. ``That's not the role we want farmers to play in our
economy,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
   To underscore his concerns about the hog industry, Glickman has
written Attorney General Janet Reno, asking her to ``scrutinize
closely'' Smithfield Foods Inc.'s proposed acquisition of Murphy
Family Farms in Rose Hill, N.C. He questioned whether there would
be ``reduced opportunities'' for hog farmers ``to bargain with
different contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's antitrust division is reviewing that
proposed merger, but officials there refuse to comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Agriculture Department, roughly 12 percent of
today's hog farms have more than 1,000 hogs and account for 78
percent of total hog inventory nationwide. In 1988, just 3.1
percent of hog farmers had inventories of 1,000 or more hogs, and
they accounted for 36 percent of the total hog inventory.
</P>
<P>
   That trend is adding fuel to the cooperative idea. Under a
national cooperative, hog farmers would pool their resources to
possibly build their own processing plant, so they would not be at
the mercy of the few, large plants that dominate the market today.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the National Pork Producers Council in Washington
is acting as the catalyst for the cooperative initiative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could immediately be a very powerful marketing tool,'' said
Steven Cohen, a spokesman for the council. A task force will meet
in Des Moines, Iowa, later this month to discuss the cooperative
idea, which appears to be gathering steam in agriculture circles.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, some Senate Democrats introduced a bill last month
calling for an 18-month moratorium on large agribusiness mergers.
Even if that bill falters this year, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a
prominent voice on American farm policy, said he will pursue the
issue into the next congressional session.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family farmers are being pushed out of the picture,'' Harkin
said.

GREEN GIANT A MASTER AT ANNOYANCE AND HUMOR 
</HEADLINE>

(Eds: Fact box at bottom.) 
 
 
By DAVID KRONKE 
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; As he winds up the taping of yet another episode of ``The Tom
Green Show,'' chock full of practical jokes and atrocities _ one of
his first produced in Los Angeles _ Tom Green is ready to hit the
showers. He drags his beloved supporting stooges _ Glenn Humplik,
who, having a name like Humplik, is accustomed to abuse, and is
therefore the victim of many of Green's pranks; and Phil Giroux,
the guy who spends the show sipping java and chortling _ into a
tiny showering booth.
</P>
<P>
   All three are as naked as MTV's standards and practices will
allow _ which, you might be surprised to hear, is not entirely
naked _ and, once packed into the shower, reed-thin Tom starts
getting a little too familiar with his more substantially built
buddies. Glenn reacts accordingly _ which is to say, with dismay _
and the combination of cramped environs and slippery floor sends
the three sprawling across the stage as the entire shower
contraption collapses in a heap of scrap aluminum. It's the perfect
bookend to the beginning of the taping, when a rowdy group of fans
swarmed Green and very nearly snapped him in half.
</P>
<P>
   These are halcyon days for Tom Green, though he admits things
are moving a bit fast. He's been in town for little more than a
month, and the reception area of his new L.A. office looks like a
disaster area, with a 4-foot-tall mountain of boxes _ his? the last
tenant's? _ tossed, not stacked, in one corner. Green has to shoot
a battery of shows before those boxes can even be dealt with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely not the ideal schedule,'' he sighs while
relaxing in his office. Unlike a lot of comics, Green isn't ``on''
during interviews _ in fact, he's so laid back and somniferous you
could almost say he's ``off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the victim of the show popping like it did. It's
shoot-shoot-shoot, throw on three shows, shoot-shoot-shoot-shoot,
throw on four shows. In Canada, we'd shoot (remote-location
segments) for six months, then go in the studio and do 13 shows.
But we're moving toward that. At least I hope we are.''
</P>
<P>
   On the day before taping that shower scene _ which is as scary
as Hitchcock's but for different reasons _ the between-segment
material for that show hadn't even been written. And 10 minutes
before the scheduled taping time, the construction crew was still
piecing together the set.
</P>
<P>
   But that's what happens when you're an overnight sensation.
Green, for the uninitiated, is a Canadian who, after years of cult
success up north, appeared on MTV back in January and became an
immediate sensation. Certainly, he was attention-getting,
performing such bits of conceptual comedy as filling his parents'
home with farm animals, trashing a grocery store with a motorized
wheelchair and enjoying fresh milk direct from its source.
Americans got a taste of Green in a series of
on-the-road-to-the-Super-Bowl commercials he did for Pepsi last
January.
</P>
<P>
   His demeanor is normally placid, but his eyes tend to betray an
element of dementia. ``He is our audience,'' declares John Miller,
MTV's senior vice president of programming and development. Miller
got a tape from Green and put the show into production without
pausing to produce a pilot episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not afraid to make an ass of himself, yet you still like
him. He apologizes after he does things. But oh, my God, he likes
to push people's buttons. He's your friend who's always pushing
you, who's seducing you and all the while you're getting into a
load of trouble. He's just egging you on.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's schtick is the sort of thing David Letterman used to do,
mixed with Andy Kaufman's brand of comic confrontation. It's
``Candid Camera'' as run by the Marquis de Sade's bratty nephew,
only the camera is never hidden. It's right in his victims' faces,
which usually amps up their irritation quotient.
</P>
<P>
   The show includes the spectacle of ostensibly ordinary people
undergoing psychological torment _ an element that's wildly popular
these days. Look at the hit film ``The Blair Witch Project'' or
prime-time game shows such as ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.''
Even the Food Network, of all places, has concocted its own,
exceedingly benign, version in which Gordon Elliot enters random
homes with a chef and makes a gourmet dinner from whatever's in his
subject's fridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, if you wanted to do a TV show, you had to have a
studio, and you had to have cameras, and it was more controlled,''
Green observes. ``TV got used to making things that were
controlled. And it's taken people a while to get used to the idea
that we can make things smaller, and when you do that, you
instantly get realer. You get real life and the public, once they
saw that for the first few times, felt a little fed up with seeing
the same thing over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   The outraged reactions Green elicits from his subjects are no
accident, he explains. ``The reason people get a little freaked out
is that we've set up our shoots in a way that we don't look like
we're from MTV or a TV station,'' he says. ``We have one cameraman,
a small-format camera _ the goal is to make people think I'm some
college student out doing some avant-garde, guerrilla piece. They
don't think it's serious in any way. So they have no problem with
punching the camera or telling me to get the hell away. Then, when
they find out it's a real show, they usually change gears.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he concedes that it's a challenge to get people he has
royally miffed to sign agreements allowing the footage to be shown
on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we lose people _ it's one of the most difficult
elements of the show, to be honest,'' he admits. ``We still haven't
been able to figure out how to do it. We have a few people who are,
you could say, highly trained at telling people, `It's just a joke
_ you've been on ``Candid Camera,''' that kind of thing. People
eventually see the humor, even if they've been really mad on
camera, to the point of being violent. I had a woman punch me in
the head three times, and as soon as the camera stopped rolling,
and the release person started talking to her, she realized she had
seen me on `Oprah.' People come around really quickly once they
realize we're from MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   Such problems didn't exist when Green did his show in Canada,
first on a cable-access channel and later on the Canadian
equivalent of Comedy Central. The show was essentially a reaction
to the youthful abuse he got from myriad security guards for doing
silly things on the premises of businesses they protected a bit too
seriously. In college, Green worked the late-night shift at the
university radio station, where he met Humplik, who is five years
his senior.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a lot of weird stuff,'' Green recalls. ``We were in
Ottawa, which is like doing a show in Washington, a conservative,
government town. We'd tell everyone listening to meet us on the
front lawn of the Parliament Building at 2 a.m. to play soccer, and
about 100 kids'd show up. ... The police'd be there, wondering what
the hell we were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Humplik represents the quintessential good sport. ``The most
embarrassing thing was when he put a hidden camera in my dressing
room while I was trying to get into supertight Spandex,'' Humplik
says, prying off the wooden clogs and Scottish kilt Green forced
him to wear for a taping. ``But it's all in good fun. It has to
hurt me for them to find it funny. Hanging out with him keeps me
mentally ageless.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has opened doors for me in real life,'' says Humplik, who
works for a computer company in Ottawa, on why he puts up with the
incessant abuse. ``My co-workers are weirded-out a lot (by the
attention).'' At this taping, Green dragged a teen-ager out of the
audience to send home with Humplik. ``I'll give (him) a blanket and
let him sleep in the car or put him up at Tom's parents' house,''
Humplik confides.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn stands up for himself _ he just reacts so perfectly to
Tom,'' says MTV's Miller. ``It's a challenge to come up with stuff
that will upset him.''
</P>
<P>
   The show's most popular vignettes involve Green annoying _ or
humiliating _ his long-suffering parents, Dick and Mary Jane. Green
has painted their home plaid, air-brushed a lesbian love scene on
the hood of his pop's car and dropped a cow's head in their bed
while they were sleeping. Though the bits are generally billed as
All In Good Fun, he admits there's a certain catharsis, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, when I was in high school and younger, they were
more controlling,'' he says. ``They've mellowed quite a bit since I
went to college and found a direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``But before that, they were extremely concerned that I was
going to end up drifting off into (oblivion) _ but I think they
took it a little more seriously than a lot of parents do.
</P>
<P>
   ``A funny thing about their situation, though, is that they were
always angry with me while growing up for doing precisely the
things I'm now doing for a living. And they were angry that I was
doing those things because they felt that if I kept doing them, I'd
fail school and I'd never be able to get a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a Catch-22 that my parents are in right now,'' he says
with a wicked smile. ``When we barge in in the middle of the night
and toss a cow's head on their bed, they're really mad that this
cow's head is bleeding on their mattress, but on the other hand,
they're really glad I'm working.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his antics _ attempting to pleasure a dead moose he
found on the side of a road, barging into viewers' homes at 3 in
the morning and irritating their parents, bellowing into a bullhorn
at passers-by that they suck _ Green has never gotten in serious
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have called the police, but there's never been any
grounds to arrest me,'' he insists. ``I'm not this irrational,
crazed lunatic who goes out and does these things without thought.
There are a lot of writers here, and we spend a lot of time before
we go out planning these things. We don't want anyone to get hurt
or emotionally distraught over anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He pauses a beat, then drops the punchline like a hammer:
``Except maybe my parents, but they deserve it.'' &QL;

<P>
   BOSTON _ The generic nickname was the giveaway; the Whitby
Seniors' shoestring budget had unraveled. Formerly the Oshawa Smith
Truckmen, they had lost their transport company sponsor for the
1955-56 Ontario Senior B amateur hockey season, and even as they
were skating to their second straight provincial championship, they
were sputtering along on financial fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Wren Blair, the full-time housing appraiser and part-time hockey
impresario who ran the team, couldn't afford to pay the players
their nominal $10-$20 stipend for each game, so he hit upon a
unique solution: If the Seniors would finish out the season, he
would split the year-end revenue among them, on a percentage basis
according to their individual value. All but two of the players
agreed, and at midseason, Blair agonizingly computed the
compensation formula. One by one, he called the players to meet him
at the Spruce Villa hotel, the local hockey hangout in the Lake
Ontario coastal town of some 7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Attersley, the Seniors' star center, was at the top of the
scale; he would get 7 percent of the take _ probably some $180 _
Blair informed him. Done.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line was the team's top defenseman. Over a beer in the
lounge, Blair revealed his remuneration: 6 1/2 percent. The
recipient, 24-year-old Harry Sinden, exploded into a rage of
indignation. ``(Expletive) you,'' he told Blair. ``I'm a
7-percenter.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair volleyed with equal vigor. ``(Expletive) you, too,'' he
said. ``As far as I'm concerned, you're worth 6 1/2 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden, who unlike most of his teammates was married with
children _ three young daughters _ got up and stormed toward the
exit. Blair pleaded for him to reconsider. ``For Christ's sake,
Harry,'' he said. ``Half a percent is going to be worth about 8
bucks. What's the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden spun on his heels. ``It's not the half-percent,'' he
advised Blair. ``It's the principle.'' And he walked out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whether the battleground is $8 or 8 cents or $8 million, it
always has been a matter of principle to Harry Sinden. And there is
no price he is willing to place on that.
</P>
<P>
   At 67, retirement age for most of his peers, he is in his 28th
season as Bruins general manager, 11th year as team president,
still feisty, still fascinating, always successful by most
standards. He won the Stanley Cup in his fourth and final year as
coach. He guided Team Canada to an earthshaking victory over the
Soviet Union after a two-year hiatus from the game. In the 31 years
he has been in Boston, the Bruins have reached the playoffs 30
times, an unprecedented achievement. And after that lone failure
two years ago, Sinden recast the club on the fly, providing this
fall's FleetCenter patrons with perhaps the most promising Boston
edition since the Big, Bad Bruins of Orr and Esposito and Cheevers.
He has presided over more victories _ 1,148 and counting _ than any
other GM in National Hockey League history. And he has done it all
with a ferocious sense of fiscal responsibility, for the past 25
years on behalf of the Buffalo-based conglomerate Delaware North.
As former scout Bart Bradley says, ``The bottom line is always
black'' for the Black and Gold.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, this last item on the ledger has left Sinden on
the debit side with some critics, as if the Bruins should be a
nonprofit organization, operating as a civic trust. Though it would
be convenient to pass the buck, Sinden emphasizes that he is under
no mandate or budgetary constraints from headquarters, and Delaware
North CEO Jeremy Jacobs corroborates this autonomy. ``The position
he's got, he's earned,'' says Jacobs. ``A number of people who work
for me have great latitude, and Harry's one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden operates by a steadfast, implicit credo: ``Mr. Jacobs
would give up an awful lot to win, but he won't give up his
business. Winning is much more important, but not if you win and
put your team in a position where it can't survive. I want to win _
the right way.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's the rub, because it's not necessarily the most
popular way. The one blank on his resume that Sinden would love to
fill is the lack of a Stanley Cup during his administration.
Detractors point to this, note that the Bruins rank 20th in payroll
(at some $27.5 million) among the 28 NHL teams, inspect the fallout
from notorious contract stalemates he's engaged in over the years _
most recently with All-Star goalie Byron Dafoe, who missed the
first dozen games of the season before signing a three-year, $9.45
million deal last weekend _ and target Sinden as the Cup culprit.
Admirers _ and they are legion outside the ranks of the Players
Association and agents _ applaud him for maintaining a consistent
level of excellence while adhering to sound business principles.
While short-lived dynasties have crumbled under the weight of their
bills, Sinden has overseen five Stanley Cup finalists and constant
contenders. Yet he acknowledges that the lack of the grand prize
feeds into the notion that he is a cheapskate and that bothers him.
</P>
<P>
   But he doesn't duck the public relations flak, refuses to
retreat from a stance that assistant GM Mike O'Connell says has
been arrived at ``through very careful research, a lot of
homework,'' and has earned the grudging admiration of even those in
an adversarial position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harry's pay scale is different from the vast majority of
general managers, and he sticks to it,'' says Steve Freyer, agent
for 21-year veteran defenseman Ray Bourque, the most beloved Bruin
of Sinden's tenure who nonetheless endured a traumatic arbitration
process in 1992 that Freyer believes was unnecessary. ``One of
Harry's defining characteristics is that he's a believer. He deeply
believes in his position and he sticks to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been that way, on both sides of the bargaining table,
throughout his life, no matter the cost.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He was at the pinnacle. After a 29-year famine, and more
recently an eight-year stretch as bottom feeders in the six-team
NHL, the Bruins had captured the 1970 Stanley Cup. There seemed no
horizon to their dominance. With dynamic defenseman Bobby Orr,
scoring metronome Phil Esposito, swashbuckling goaltender Gerry
Cheevers, and a roguish, robust supporting cast, the Big, Bad
Bruins had become the rage of Boston and seemed on the threshold of
becoming the scourge of the now 12-team NHL. And at the helm was
37-year-old Harry Sinden, seemingly about to reap the rewards of a
hardscrabble journey through hockey's hinterlands.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Bruins were a sublimely talented outfit that
presumably could run on autopilot, the stars themselves exposed the
fallacy of this conventional wisdom. ``Harry Sinden was the best
coach I ever had in pro hockey,'' says Esposito. ``He understood
our team totally. He handled everybody really well. He understood
each player as an individual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was his genius,'' says Esposito's fellow center from that
era, Derek Sanderson.
</P>
<P>
   There was one problem. Money. Sinden had received a $15,000
salary when he was promoted to Boston after leading the Bruins'
affiliate in Oklahoma City to the Central Hockey League title in
1966. While on the trail to the Cup, he had received a $2,000
raise, ``so I could go out and get myself some new clothes,'' he
recalls with a laugh. But he had made a discovery that he didn't
find funny: The going rate for an NHL head coach was $30,000. And
during the 1969-70 season, he had received an eye-popping offer
from an old Toronto high school friend, Dave Stirling: a $40,000
salary plus some $1 million in stock options to join the booming
firm of Stirling-Homex, a company based in suburban Rochester,
N.Y., that sold prefabricated housing. He informed Bruins owner
Weston Adams Sr. of the salary discrepancy and was offered a raise
_ to $22,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd gone to $25,000,'' he says, ``I probably would have
stayed. I didn't want to leave hockey.''
</P>
<P>
   But, with four daughters now to support, he did leave. When he
rejected the Bruins' raise and advised Adams of his business
alternative, the owner told him, ``Have a nice career.''
</P>
<P>
   So less than a week after taking a triumphal ride through the
streets of Boston during the championship parade, Sinden shockingly
announced his retirement. Hearing of this, a stunned Sanderson told
management, ``You just lost the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   The divorce didn't last long. Within two years, the bottom fell
out on prefab housing and the company stock, and Sinden lost his
life savings. Having no income, he accepted international hockey
wheeler-dealer Alan Eagleson's invitation to coach the Canadians in
an eight-game exhibition series against the Soviets, with nothing
more than world supremacy at stake in a true Cold War environment.
After they staggered to a 1-2-1 record on their home ice, Sinden
convinced the cocky Canadians of what he already knew from his
participation in the 1960 Olympics: The Russians were for real.
Both chastened and galvanized, Team Maple Leaf salvaged the series
with three one-goal victories in the Soviet Union, and Sinden
parlayed that success into a return to Boston in 1972, this time
strictly as an executive: managing director of hockey. He's been
running the Bruins ever since.
</P>
<P>
   That his break with hockey amounted to little more than a
sabbatical is not what resonates some three decades later. The fact
that he was willing to make it _ a supreme sacrifice for a man who
had grown up wanting nothing more than a life in the game _ speaks
volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Blair, his mentor, had learned that day at the Spruce Villa that
Sinden, who took his 6 1/2 percent and finished out the season,
``is a man of principled values.'' In other words, an overriding
sense of duty _ not in pursuit of every possible dollar but for the
sake of his family. That's why his own interests always finished
second.

   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``MY GARDEN (BOOK)''  &QL; 
By Jamaica Kincaid (FSG, $23) &QL; 
Jamaica Kincaid has written books full of her difficult feelings
for her mother and her brother, but boy, does she love her garden.
She is agitated and vexed when she's in it, but she's happy:
``Nothing works just the way I thought it would, nothing looks just
the way I had imagined it, and when sometimes it does look like
what I had imagined (and this, thank God, is rare) I am startled
that my imagination is so ordinary.'' This book is dense with
growing things, overrun with blooms, fertile with every plant
you've ever heard of and then some. Fellow gardening author Michael
Pollan says Kincaid's voice is that of ``an exquisitely attentive
gardener thinking out loud.'' We'd note that ``exquisitely
attentive'' is a kind way of saying ``obsessed,'' but then it's all
New &AMP; Notable can do to water the tomatoes. Kincaid celebrates seed
and plant catalogs, discusses the link between gardeners and
conquerors, and notes that ``everyone I have ever met who has a
garden has something growing in it from seeds that were gathered in
Monet's garden.'' That means she cultivates exotic friends, too. &QL; 
``THE BOOK BORROWER'' &QL; 
By Alice Mattison (Morrow, $24) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This odd and meandering novel begins with the meeting of two
young mothers at a park in 1975. Deborah Laidlaw is there with her
daughters, Toby Ruben with her baby son, and in the course of their
conversation Toby borrows a book that Deborah has been carrying
around but has not found time to read. Two things begin in this
scene: a lifelong friendship between Toby and Deborah, and our
interest in the fate of that borrowed book, ``Trolley Girl,'' the
story of a tragedy that occurred during a strike among trolley
workers in 1921. For much of her novel, Mattison alternates the
interplay between Toby, Deborah and their families with sections
narrated by the author of ``Trolley Girl.'' We're not sure why she
does this but we're grateful for it, because ``Trolley Girl''
proceeds with a sense of purpose and anticipation. The ground is
not so firm under Toby and Deborah, whose friendship unfolds in
rambling conversations and unseen resolutions. One chapter ends
with a terrible conflict between the two friends when Toby almost
gets Deborah fired from her teaching job. To our surprise, the next
chapter begins years later, with their friendship obviously
restored, although Mattison does not say how. This is exasperating,
but ``The Book Borrower'' is not without saving graces. One is Toby
Ruben, an authentic character who slips into mean-spiritedness when
she feels threatened. Another is Mattison's portrayal of the give
and take between friends, between men and women, between parents
and children _ that messy navigation of emotional ties. In the end,
her novel is less notable for its story than for these small
moments that ring true. &QL; 
``IF THIS HOUSE COULD TALK'' &QL; 
By Elizabeth Smith Brownstein (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I have found that it is the visible, the tangible, that goes a
long way in softening prejudices,'' Booker T. Washington wrote in
``Up From Slavery.'' ``The actual sight of a first-class house that
a Negro has built is 10 times more potent than pages of discussion
about a house that he ought to build, or perhaps could build.'' And
so, against the wishes of some of his benefactors, Washington built
``The Oaks,'' a red brick house with parlor, library, dining room,
kitchen, family and guest bedrooms, den, breakfast room, five
bathrooms and a veranda on three acres of land overlooking the
campus of Alabama's Tuskegee Institute. Among the other buildings
included in this look at historic homes and the people who lived in
them are the stunning ``symphony in wood'' built in 1908 (for a
mere $55,000) for Proctor &AMP; Gamble heir David Gamble in Pasadena,
Calif.; the New Hampshire farm of poet Robert Frost; Lorenzo
Hubbell's house and trading post in Ganado; the Massachusetts
homestead of Rebecca Nurse, who was hanged during the Salem witch
trials; the Bronx, N.Y., cottage of Edgar Allan Poe; and Frank
Lloyd Wright's Storer House and Auldbrass Plantation. Our favorite
is illustrator Edward Gorey's Cape Cod cottage, where books are
piled precariously high on every horizontal surface in sight. This
engaging blend of history, architecture and interior design
contains what its author calls ``stories of great passion, courage
and brilliance . . . and enough cruelty, greed and ignorance to go
around.'' &QL; 
``THE COST OF LIVING'' &QL; 
By Arundhati Roy (Modern Library, $11.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Roy follows her Booker Prize-winning first novel, ``The God of
Small Things,'' with two essays, one on dam projects that have
scarred her native India and the other on India's detonation last
year of a nuclear bomb. The first, called ``The Greater Common
Good,'' is more demanding reading, but both benefit from Roy's very
personal and appealingly abrasive style. In the second essay, ``The
End of Imagination,'' she touches on the success of her novel.
``The more I thought about it,'' she writes, ``the clearer it
became to me that if fame was going to be my permanent condition it
would kill me. Club me to death with its good manners and hygiene.
I'll admit that I've enjoyed my own five minutes of it immensely
but primarilyBECAUSE (editor: ITAL) it was just five minutes.
Because I knew (or thought I knew) that I could go home when I was
bored and giggle about it. Grow old and irresponsible. Eat mangoes
in the moonlight. Maybe write a couple of failed books _
worstsellers _ to see what it felt like.'' Instead, she has written
this, a thought-provoking challenge from a citizen of India and of
the world. &QL;

 (Repeating for all needing.)  
 BOSTON: ... finished second.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Riding through Toronto a few years back with Bradley and Bruins
director of development Bob Tindall, Sinden conducted a nostalgic
tour of his boyhood neighborhood in York Township. He stopped in
front of a house and told his passengers, ``That's where I grew
up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The car was almost as long as the house,'' recalls Tindall.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Sinden Sr. was in charge of maintenance at the Ontario
Hydro power plant, ``and we were middle class,'' says Harry Jr.
``Lower middle class.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy shared a second-story bedroom with his grandfather,
Jimmy Sinclair. Every morning at 3, his grandfather would sit at
the edge of his bed smoking a cigarette, ``and he'd wake me up,
too,'' says Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't so bad. It gave the boy more time to play in the
huge park known as Red Square across the street. ``I grew up on the
city streets,'' says Sinden. More accurately, he grew up on the
fields of Red Square, joining hundreds of other kids in whatever
sport was in season. During the winter, the baseball diamonds were
flooded to create three or four rinks, and Sinden would spend the
entire day playing a helter-skelter game of hockey. ``There might
be 100 kids on a rink at one time,'' he says. ``The older kids
would play end to end. The rest of us would play side to side or
corner to corner. You'd have to know who you were playing against
to stay in the right game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden would go home to eat lunch, keeping his skates on while
his mother placed a towel under his feet to protect the floor, then
dash back to the pond until supper time. This was formal dining,
skates prohibited, but Sinden quickly would rejoin the action under
a lone street light and continue playing until the upstairs lights
in his house flashed. ``That was the signal to get your ass home,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   When he could afford it, his father would take him to see the
NHL in action at Maple Leaf Gardens. Otherwise, ``it was the
pastime of every Canadian kid to listen to Maple Leaf games on the
radio,'' says Sinden. ``If they lost, you'd cry yourself to
sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Sinden would be playing the game,
developing into a slick, savvy defenseman _ ``like Brian Leetch
today,'' says Tindall _ with two major deficiencies: size (5 feet 9
inches, 180 pounds) and skating ability. Still, ``I never had
hockey off my mind,'' says Sinden. ``I never got it out of my mind
that I was going to be a player someday.''
</P>
<P>
   He was good enough to play at the major junior level, and at 17,
he joined the Oshawa Generals, relocating on his own 32 miles from
Toronto. ``Back then, it was forever,'' he says. ``There were no
throughways. My parents would come to see every home game, but I
was billeted with a family in Oshawa.''
</P>
<P>
   On the same street lived the Brodies, and each day, Sinden would
see their 16-year-old daughter, Eleanor, walking either to school
or her job at the telephone company. ``I wanted to ask her out,''
says Sinden, ``but I was kind of shy, so a buddy of mine did. Then
I said, `I'm going to ask her next.' Nobody else ever asked her
out.''
</P>
<P>
   They were married three years later, and within four years,
Nancy, Carol, and Donna were born; Julie would complete the family
a decade after that.
</P>
<P>
   His junior career finished, he no longer could afford to be a
carefree hockey player with big dreams. His skills were obvious:
``He was a real heady player,'' says Attersley, now a tire magnate
and for 11 years Whitby's mayor. ``When he'd get the puck in our
end, I'd know where to go and he'd put the puck right on my
stick.'' But his drawbacks were evident, too. In an expanded NHL,
he'd have had no problem becoming a mainstay, but the six-team
league had little room for diminutive, slow-footed defensemen.
There was only one minor league _ the American Hockey League _ at
the time, and it was the logical path for players biding their time
for a shot with the Original Six. ``But it also could be the path
to oblivion,'' says Sinden. And stability had become paramount. ``I
had plenty of opportunities to go to the AHL _ Hershey, Cleveland _
but I had to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   He opted for the sure thing: employment at the General Motors
plant in Oshawa, where he had begun working as a stationary
engineer at age 19, running the gargantuan coal-driven steam
boilers that powered the tools for the production line. It was
steady work at decent money, and with union protection _ the NHLPA
might not appreciate the irony that Sinden eventually became a shop
steward _ it meant security. So while Sinden says that ``in the
back of your mind, you never give up the idea that you might make
it to the NHL someday,'' practically speaking, he was a full-time
blue-collar worker and part-time world-class amateur hockey player.
Just to keep a skate in the game, he accepted Blair's invitation to
join the Senior B team, and he often would work the graveyard shift
at GM, the team bus dropping him off at the plant's gates after
night games in Belleville or Kingston or Brockville or Cornwall so
he could start feeding the voracious furnaces at 1 a.m. And the
next day, there might be another game three hours away and more
graveyard duty at the end of the trail. But it was worth it to
Sinden, and Blair's boys flourished on the ice. After their
perilous second season, they became the Whitby Dunlops, sponsored
by the tire company, moving up to Senior A and winning the Allan
Cup as Canada's national amateur champions. They represented their
country at Oslo and won the world championship in the spring of
1958, and two years later, Sinden earned a silver medal as Canada
finished second to the upstart United States at the Squaw Valley
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, another minor circuit, the Eastern Professional
Hockey League, had begun play, and the woebegone Bruins intended to
install a team at Kingston, Ontario, with Blair in charge. He
wanted Sinden to go with him, but by now, Blair's best defenseman
was making $5,200 at GM, having risen from fourth- to second-class
engineer at the plant. And while he'd drop by Blair's house and
share a beer while sitting in his car in the driveway after his
shift, family man Sinden couldn't be enticed to make the move.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Blair called Boston GM Lynn Patrick and said, ``I want
to pay Sinden $5,200.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick almost swallowed the phone. ``Just what I need,'' he
barked at Blair. ``A slow 27-year-old defenseman for $5,200.
That'll get us out of last place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who says I'm talking about him just as a defenseman?''
retorted Blair. ``You and Milt (Schmidt, the Boston coach) aren't
going to be around forever, and I think this kid has the potential
to take over the Bruins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we're going,'' said Patrick, ``I may not be around
next week.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the GM needed no convincing about Sinden's leadership
possibilities. While scouting the Detroit-Toronto playoff series
that spring, he had shared several train rides with Sinden, who was
commuting to play on loan for the Montreal Canadiens' Hull-Ottawa
EPHL team. They had talked a lot of hockey; Patrick had liked what
he heard.
</P>
<P>
   So Sinden became Blair's captain at Kingston for the same money
he was making at GM. There even was a sweetener to the deal. ``They
gave me $2,500 to sign,'' says Sinden. ``That enabled me to get out
of debt.'' It seems the tax man is as relentless north of the
border as here; Revenue Canada was cracking down on the senior
amateur players for not reporting their per diem pittances as
income, and Sinden's toll came to $1,200, which he borrowed from
his grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   At last, he was a full-time hockey player at a living wage, but
as a fallback, he took a summer job as an engineer at a Kingston
nylon plant, then began selling real estate. Besides, he knew
playing wasn't his future. ``I never would have made the move from
Oshawa to Kingston,'' says Sinden, ``if I hadn't been interested in
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   In his third year at Kingston, he became a player-coach under
Blair, and the following year, when the EPHL became the CHL and the
Bruins relocated their farm club to Minneapolis, Sinden went behind
the bench full time. Minneapolis gave way to Oklahoma City, and
after his title run there, Sinden was deemed ready to take over the
worst team in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Those penny-pinching days and the Bruins' era of futility now
seem like ancient history. Sinden is entrenched as a seven-figure
executive, ``and that team has been consistent for so long,'' says
Glen Sather, the Edmonton Oilers president-GM who played for Sinden
in Oklahoma City and Boston and now accompanies him on offseason
hunting and fishing retreats in the Canadian wilds. ``It's very
well managed. Those people in Boston have no idea what that team
was like before he took over the reins.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he has spoiled them, because for all the rewards, it
seems the grief never ceases.

   TAKE-ART-BOS  
 (Repeating for all needing.)  
 BOSTON: ... never ceases.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is no simple label to place on the man or his reign.
Perhaps because of the disheveled look he presents after an evening
of intensive inspection of the product on the ice from his skybox
perch at the FleetCenter _ ``as if he just played the game,'' says
Sanderson _ and his often intransigent negotiating, Sinden is
caricatured as a rough-and-ready street brawler. That is as
inaccurate as it is simplistic.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden is a gourmet cook _ ``Well, I cook gourmet food,
anyway,'' he says with a laugh. ``I started it when I was coaching
because I found it relaxes me.'' He is a ravenous reader with a
preference for history who can expound on Churchill as readily as
he does the neutral zone trap. ``He's very complicated in many
ways,'' says Mark Witkin, agent for Bruins defenseman Don Sweeney,
among others. ``He's much more sophisticated than people would
think. He's a very intelligent man who can be gracious, and you can
learn a lot from him on a ton of subjects.''
</P>
<P>
   And, contrary to his bulldog reputation, he is a doer of good
deeds, though he prefers that they be kept below the radar. Sather
remembers being a lonely 20-year-old in Oklahoma City who was
invited to Christmas dinner by his coach, thus triggering a
lifelong friendship. Bruins senior assistant to the president Nate
Greenberg says Sinden regularly donates his speaking fees to
charity _ with the proviso that there be no publicity. Mark
Perrone, a former agent who represented Cam Neely, recalls that
when the Bruins star's father died of cancer, two people came to
his home in the middle of the night to console him: Perrone and
Sinden. He expressed similar sorrow when former loose-cannon Bruins
coach Don Cherry's wife, Rose, died; in the process, Sinden put
aside the fact that Cherry, now Canada's foremost TV-radio hockey
personality, had made him an object of ridicule ever since the
five-year relationship between GM and coach degenerated into a
blood feud before Cherry left in 1979. Cherry now says, ``I owe
everything I have to Harry Sinden.'' And Islanders GM Mike Milbury,
who served under Sinden as player, coach, and assistant GM, says,
``He's a good-hearted man. I won't even begin to list the number of
players he's helped with their lives after hockey. There's a
thousand of them. Just look at how many ex-Bruins wind up working
for the team in some capacity.'' Sometimes it goes beyond that.
Sanderson, now a successful businessman whose career was curtailed
by substance abuse, is forever grateful to Sinden for paying out of
his own pocket for part of his ex-player's hip replacements. ``And
he gave me the TV analyst's job early in my sobriety,'' says
Sanderson. ``He took a chance on me. He didn't have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden's reputation at ice level is no less glossy. Through the
years, the Toronto street kid with the high school diploma and the
engineer's license has developed into perhaps hockey's most
eloquent spokesman. ``At the league level,'' says former Islanders
GM and current Florida Panthers president Bill Torrey, ``he's tried
to put the good of the game right at the top of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheevers, now a Bruins scout, considers his boss ``the best
hockey guy I've been around, one of the few guys I've seen who
could coach in 1968 and 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it seems that recently, all that has been overshadowed by
the contract confrontations _ such as with Jason Allison, Anson
Carter, and Kyle McLaren last season, and Dafoe this year. And
there is a hornet's nest looming next summer, when the contracts of
Bourque, Allison, Sweeney, Carter, Dave Andreychuk, Joe Thornton,
and Sergei Samsonov, among others, expire. ``It's a lot of work,''
acknowledges Sinden. ``As always, we'll tinker with it, do what we
can, but we can only go so far.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, as O'Connell says, ``We'll meet the market but
we won't set new markets.'' Meanwhile, Sinden looks at the
extravagant Rangers, who are paying a league-high $59 million for a
team that missed the playoffs last season, and warns, ``If we all
did business like New York, we'd all lose $40 million-$50
million.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not what the players and agents want to hear. Perrone
speaks for the minority when he says, ``I regard him as a true
purist, a guardian of the game, who carries the banner for the
traditionalists day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   Others believe Sinden's interpretation of tradition has become
tiresome. Allison, whose 1998-99 season began with a contract
hassle and ended with Sinden criticizing him for poor play in Game
6 of the second playoff round when the Bruins were eliminated at
Buffalo, won't discuss his boss. And Witkin says, ``If there's one
thing I could change, it's the specter of money that always
overhangs the team. I wish it wasn't so predominant.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who held out for 15 games last season, claims that
around the league, ``a lot of players I talk to think Boston is a
great city but don't want to play for Harry. That's the reputation
he's got. When I came here from Washington, I was surprised the
first time I met him to find out he was a regular guy. I thought he
was going to be the Grinch or something.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Carter acknowledges what Sinden always has maintained:
It's nothing personal. ``He's a nice man,'' says Carter. ``I try to
tell that to other guys. The negotiations are just something you
have to go through every couple of years, like a rite of passage.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a basic philosophy, and Sinden won't budge from it.
Dafoe, who was seeking a raise to $4 million from $850,000 and
eventually dimissed his agent, Ron Salcer, recalls, ``Harry told me
at one point, `It would be easy for me to give you $3.5 million,
considering the beating I'm taking from the public and press. But I
just don't think it's right.' What can I say? You have to respect
him for that. I think he thought he was being fair with me. And
after it was over, he talked to me for a half-hour and cleared the
air. I appreciated that.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not as if the players are at the poverty level.
``There's a lot of healthy contracts around here,'' says Bourque,
who in the wake of losing his arbitration case signed a five-year,
$12.5 million contract that made him the highest-paid Bruin at the
time. ``There's a reason for that _ because Harry's so good at his
job.''
</P>
<P>
   His sheer longevity in that job, given its massive headaches and
burnout quotient, defies logic. Tom Johnson, recently retired as
Sinden's longtime lieutenant, takes a stab at explaining it. ``The
challenge,'' he says. ``The rules and regulations of the game, the
free agency and contracts _ he thrives on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Others marvel that he can stomach it. ``Although he keeps saying
he wants to go and he deserves that time, can he cut the cord?''
says current coach Pat Burns. ``As a friend, I'd like to see him do
it. As a coach, I don't want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Sinden may be getting ready for a gradually reduced
role. He says he'd like to stay on for another five years but hints
that this may be his last as GM. ``It's definitely on my agenda,''
he says. In fact, he was ready to become exclusively club president
three years ago, but he thought that would be taking the easy way
out. The Bruins' three-decade playoff run had just ended, ``and I
didn't want to look like I was walking out'' on the mess.
</P>
<P>
   His heir apparent, O'Connell, is handling more of the daily
chores but isn't eager to let Sinden head into the sunset.
``Everything that comes up, I want to include him,'' says
O'Connell, ``because he has such good insights.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden realizes that's subject to debate; it's the nature of the
beast. ``But I'm still doing it,'' he says, ``so I must enjoy it,
right?''
</P>
<P>
   That's the bottom line.

CLINTON BUYS TIME FOR DECISION ON TARGET RANGE IN PUERTO RICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton is buying more time to seek a
compromise solution to a six-month standoff between the Navy and
Puerto Rico over using the island of Vieques for target practice.
</P>
<P>
   There's still ``a chance that we will reach an accommodation''
between the Navy's appeal to resume using the 58-year-old target
range and Puerto Rico's opposition to any resumption of
bombardment, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, citing his ``heavy responsibilities'' as
commander-in-chief to ensure preparation of American forces for
combat, said he hoped for a compromise that ``respects the
legitimate interests both of the people of Puerto Rico ... and the
national security interests of the Navy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said ``about a month'' remained for a compromise to
emerge, adding: ``We're going to work hard at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's remarks came in an interview with the
Spanish-language television network Telemundo on Friday evening
during his visit to Hartford, Conn. The White House released a
transcript of the interview on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has pressed the White House for a presidential go-ahead
by mid-November to enable a Navy-Marine Corps battle group led by
the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower to conduct four to
six weeks of combat rehearsals on Vieques beginning in early
December.
</P>
<P>
   The armada is scheduled to head to the Persian Gulf on Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's latest timetable for a decision give his
administration and the government of Puerto Rico more time to seek
a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Lt. Cdr. Herman Phillips, a Navy spokesman at the Pentagon,
said Atlantic-based Navy and Marine forces ordinarily train
together for about a month around Vieques before returning to home
ports for about a month and then deploying overseas for six months.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the president will
leave it to Defense Secretary William Cohen to seek a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is very much looking forward to the Pentagon
continuing their dialogue and mediation and will look to their
recommendation on coming up with a solution to the Vieques
problem,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello continued to reject any
negotiations with the Pentagon that include resumption of live-fire
combat training on the nearby island.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello's spokesman, Alfonso Aguilar, said late Monday that the
governor was aware of the president's latest remarks but would not
open negotiations that included resumption of Navy and Marine Corps
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are willing to accommodate almost everything except that
the Navy has to close the target range and end the bombing on the
island of Vieques,'' said Rossello's spokesman. ``We're willing to
talk to the administration and continue talking _ but those two
conditions are not going to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said last Thursday that he hoped to meet with Rossello to
``have a dialogue'' on the bitter dispute, adding: ``I would like
to talk to the governor.'' Rossello's spokesman said late Monday
that neither Cohen nor any of his staff had contacted the governor
to set up the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't received anything,'' Aguilar said.
</P>
<P>
   On Vieques, the 899-acre bombing range and an adjacent
11,000-acre Marine maneuver range have been closed since April 19
when a Marine Corps pilot mistakenly targeted a hilltop observation
post. The accidental twilight attack with two 500 pound bombs
killed David Sanes Rodriguez, 35, a Puerto Rican security guard
working for the Navy, and injured four other civilians working on
the bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, the first civilian death on the range since it
opened in 1941, took place almost 10 miles from a three-mile wide
swathe of land where 9,300 civilians reside on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's renewed quest for compromise comes amid mounting
political pressure on Capitol Hill to clear the way for the Navy to
resume combat training on Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John Warner, R-Va.,
backed by Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., the panel's top Democrat, have
vowed to convene an emergency Senate hearing to challenge any White
House attempt to send the Navy battle group to the Persian Gulf
without combat training on Vieques.

ISRAELIS, PALESTINIANS BEGIN TOUGH PEACE TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH HORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ After a series of stops and starts,
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators Monday launched tough
negotiations aimed at reaching a comprehensive peace treaty by
September 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators, flanked by teams of
military advisers and experts, met for 75 minutes at the Grand Park
Hotel in the West Bank town of Ramallah, where they staked out
their opening positions on the most sensitive issues dividing them.
</P>
<P>
   They include the future of Jerusalem, the fates of Israeli
settlers and millions of Palestinian refugees, security
arrangements, secure borders and ``issues of common interest,''
such as water rights.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides sounded upbeat about reaching a deal by the date set
in the latest Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started with a very open and frank atmosphere, without any
barriers, and with this atmosphere, I believe we will be able to
build the agreement we all seek,'' said the lead Palestinian
negotiator, Information Minister Yasser Abed Rabbo.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli diplomat Oded Eran, who heads the Israeli team,
predicted the negotiators would be able to meet their ambitious
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long road we have to cover in a very short time, but
(with a) joint effort we can make it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most political analysts predicted that the real bargaining will
be done through back channels similar to the secret talks in Oslo,
Norway, that led to the first Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing novel or unprecedented about this,'' said Mark
Heller, a political analyst at the Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies, Tel Aviv University. ``This is the way negotiations have
always gone on.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres held the
first round of final status negotiations, a largely symbolic
meeting. Peres lost to Benjamin Netanyahu and serious negotiations
stalled after only one session.
</P>
<P>
   Three-and-a-half years later, Prime Minister Ehud Barak
relaunched the talks during a September meeting with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting was the first working session since then.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said they expect a deal will be struck after both
sides make difficult concessions but that an agreement will not be
wrapped up in 10 months.
</P>
<P>
   On the Israeli side, the most difficult concession likely will
involve tearing down some settlements in the West Bank, which
Israel seized from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East war, and the Gaza
Strip, which Israel captured from Egypt in the same conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has already talked about creating ``settlement blocks'' in
the West Bank and Gaza that would stay under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   And the Israeli leader has proved his willingness to take on the
settlers by ordering 12 rogue West Bank outposts removed _ a move
not even the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin felt he had
the political clout to do.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian side, the most difficult bargaining will
probably be over the number of refugees allowed to return to the
West Bank and Gaza, analysts said. Most said the two sides will
likely agree on a number far smaller than the 4 million or so
Palestinians currently living outside the territory that became the
state of Israel in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Israelis have to make the huge step that they are going to
concentrate some settlements and remove the rest,'' said Reuven
Hazan, a political analyst at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   Hazen said Arafat must make ``the huge leap,'' but he added that
``I don't see the possibility of ... half a million (refugees) to
show up on the doorstep of the Palestinian Authority.''
</P>
<P>
   As for borders, Palestinians want Israel to withdraw from all of
the West Bank and Gaza to the boundary that existed before the 1967
war. Even the most dovish Israeli leaders talk about ceding 90
percent of Gaza and no more than 70 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The sides remain far apart on Jerusalem, by far the most
emotional issue at the talks. Israel maintains the city is its
indivisible, eternal capital. The Palestinians consider the eastern
half of Jerusalem as part of the West Bank and claim it as their
future capital.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Barak also has pledged to reach some kind of
understanding with Lebanon, or a full peace agreement with Syria,
that would allow him to pull troops out of southern Lebanon within
roughly a year. Israeli soldiers have occupied a strip of land
inside Lebanon since 1985. But their losses have mounted in recent
years in small-unit firefights with Islamic guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Some movement has occurred on the Syrian negotiating track,
which has been stalled for more than three years. Over the weekend,
Bashar Assad, Syrian President Hafez Assad's son, met with French
President Jacques Chirac. The president was expected to pass on the
issues they discussed to Barak, who arrived Monday in Paris.

   This is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black
students at Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are
attending one school -- historically black Texas Southern
University, state higher education officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with
minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez, gene

 &HT;    Five things to know about mold
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mold isn't just the stuff that grows on stale bread and old
cheese. Microscopic mold spores can trigger allergies and worsen
asthma, especially during the fall season. A few varieties are even
toxic. Here are some tips on how to reduce mold in your home.
</P>
<P>
   1. Mold likes wet places. So keep your house dry. In your
bathroom, run the exhaust vent while bathing or showering and for
at least 15 minutes afterward. If you don't have a vent in the
bathroom, open a window to let out moist air. (Generally, though,
windows should stay closed.) Fix cracked basement walls and leaky
pipes. Damp wallboard, wet carpets and even wet cardboard boxes
also are havens for mold. If flooding occurs, dry out everything as
quickly as possible. Once mold gets inside walls, it's very
difficult to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   2. Keep windows closed. And use a dehumidifier.
</P>
<P>
   3. If you're sensitive to mold, find someone who isn't to mow
your lawn and rake leaves. Those activities can stir up mold
spores.
</P>
<P>
   4. Store firewood outside. Don't keep too many plants indoors _
mold likes wet soil.
</P>
<P>
   5. If you want to clean up mold yourself, wear a special mask
such as a respirator or a HEPA filter mask that will filter out
mold spores. Scrub _ don't scrape _ at mold patches, using a
solution of 1 cup of chlorine bleach to 1 gallon of water.
</P>
<P>
   Major mold problems may require professional cleaning. Look in
the Yellow Pages under ``Flood Control Equipment and Services.''

 &HT;    Barnes backs N.C. plan for Georgia schoolsBy Doug Cumming
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, N.C. _ Teaching to the test.
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what seventh-grade language-arts teacher Susie
Holloman is doing. Her 26 students have just been graded on a
practice version of North Carolina's seventh grade writing test,
five months before the real thing. Holloman is going over their
results like a coach at half-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is going to give you a page and three-quarters of
another page,'' she explains. She's told them before, and tells
them again, this means you don't just fill one page. ``No, no, no,
no, no, no,'' she says. ``If the state gives you one and
three-fourths, how much will you write?''
</P>
<P>
   ``A page and three-fourths,'' the whole class chants.
</P>
<P>
   The weight given these standardized tests in North Carolina _
Holloman could buy a new dining room suite with the $1,500 bonus
she might win if Smithfield Middle School's scores improve enough _
is the engine that drives the kind of school-accountability system
that Gov. Roy Barnes has in mind for Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Barnes extols the North Carolina system for
replacing a sizable chunk of teacher pay raises with bonuses that
go only to schools that earn them based on state test results.
</P>
<P>
   The education reform commission Barnes created and chairs is
putting the finishing touches on a set of recommendations likely to
put Georgia on the same trail North Carolina has blazed since 1995.
On Monday, the commission will put together a preliminary plan.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's ABCs of Public Education has been credited with
raising student achievement more dramatically than in any other
state, except perhaps Texas, which implemented similar reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The high stakes in North Carolina _ teacher bonuses, public
recognition of top schools, a year-long visit by a school
assistance team for a few very low-achieving schools _ create
intense pressure not to waste time in school.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say teaching to the test is part of why the
system works, because the tests are carefully matched with the
state's curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   But North Carolina's average SAT score, while rising a lot
faster than Georgia's, remains only one place above Georgia's
near-the-bottom ranking. Complaints and a few lawsuits have dogged
North Carolina's reforms since the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a while, and it's not foolproof and not perfect,''
said Jay Robinson, retired chairman of the state's Board of
Education, who is credited along with Gov. Jim Hunt with creating
the ABCs system. ``But it's better than anything we had.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's advice for Georgia: ``You're about in the same shape
we were in when we started this. If you don't start making
progress, we seriously run the risk of losing public schools as
we've known them.''
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's bumpy ride can offer important lessons to
Georgia, though no easy solutions. As it turns out, getting
improved results is hard work, and never finished. Some unintended
consequences require fixes. Others require waiting and watching.
Others take toughing it out, say supporters of the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   But even disgruntled teachers and other critics in North
Carolina say a school accountability system is the only way to go.
The arguments now are about making adjustments in the system, not
turning back the clock. The main complaints heard in North Carolina
these days are:
</P>
<P>
   _ High-stakes testing is stressful for teachers and students
alike.
</P>
<P>
   _ Winning the big bucks seems to be unfairly difficult for some
schools, and seems to get harder after a few years of steady
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teaching to the test can squeeze instruction, giving short
shrift to in-depth projects or untested subjects such as art, music
and elementary science and social studies.
</P>
<P>
   Holloman's class at Smithfield Middle School may be an extreme
example of teaching to the test, since she specifically clues
students on what test-scorers will look for.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to tell whether the students are pumped up, or
stressed out. Probably both. That ambiguity cuts through the entire
North Carolina school system.
</P>
<P>
   The two students who scored a perfect ``4'' on Holloman's
made-up test _ Larryshia Lewis and Juanita Flonard, who were asked
to stand for classroom applause _ had used what the state's
checklist calls ``power words'' (hard words like ``morose'' and
``tentative''), ``transitions'' (such as ``meanwhile'') and
``sensory details'' (details that use one of the five senses).
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it count on our grade, because the fourth grade writing
test didn't?'' asked Tracy Peele.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Holloman said, explaining to them that scores on the
real test will count for the school.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Troubling Consequences of the ABCs,'' a recent critical
report by The Common Sense Foundation, a Raleigh-based
social-justice advocacy group, called for extra incentives to keep
teachers from leaving low-performing schools, rewards for
successfully educating students of all races and tests that are
more open-ended, in contrast to the current dominance of
multiple-choice questions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the state Board of Education was concerned about what are
called the unintended consequences of the ABCs, such as whether to
test a student with excessive absences
</P>
<P>
   At a special meeting last week to look at such questions, no
changes were made. ``Our sense now is that this has served us
well,'' said Henry Johnson associate state superintendent for
instruction and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers feel heightened stress, clearly, but most say it has
brought a welcome focus to everything they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ABCs in North Carolina have improved instruction more than
anything,'' said Jerry Stevens, the engagingly informal principal
of Selma Elementary. ``I'm more focused, my faculty is more focused
and my parents are more focused on the basics of education.''
</P>
<P>
   The B of ABCs stands for the basics. The A is for
accountability, and the C for control, as in local control. The
state Department of Public Instruction drastically slashed its
staff and its regulations, on the theory that if you hold schools
and districts accountable for student achievement through a good
test, much of the state staffing and regulations aren't necessary.
</P>
<P>
   In unanticipated ways, accountability requires new state
controls, new regulations. At first, teachers who won bonuses voted
on whether to share their winnings with non-teaching staff. But so
many teachers complained about the pressure to share, the state
abolished the local vote on money-sharing and gives the money
directly to teachers and administrators, and a lesser bonus to
teacher aides. When the state discovered a district was shifting
struggling students out of high school courses midway through the
year into courses that aren't tested to avoid lowering the
end-of-course test average, it imposed a rule against the practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings you back to rules and regulations,'' said Lou
Fabrizio, state director of accountability services. ``That's the
bottom-line, number one problem. Local control and accountability
are in conflict, or sometimes at odds.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, the principal, has bones to pick with the ABCs.
Although the formula is designed to be fair to high-poverty schools
like Selma Elementary by rewarding year-to-year improvement,
Stevens believes the formula has worked against him. He said the
reason his school failed to make even ``expected'' improvement last
year was because its scores were high to begin with. Also, he
believes improvement comes more slowly with students like his, many
from ragged circumstances in housing projects and trailer parks.
</P>
<P>
   Selma Elementary missed winning a ``School of Distinction''
rating only because its writing scores fell from number two in the
county to dead last. Stevens said he has no idea why those scores
fell.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says the tests are fair because they are strictly
based on the state's curriculum. The ABCs make everybody work
harder to teach that curriculum, he said. ``We're biting and
clawing as hard as we can to get that money,'' he said. ``It
becomes my job to keep the morale of this school up.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston County, a half-hour drive southeast of Raleigh, has
been an incubator of school reform. When Gov. Barnes kicked off his
reform commission June 7, the county's superintendent, James
Causby, was the keynote speaker, after Barnes.

   When the ABCs were introducing high-stakes accountability to
schools in 1996, Causby was using the same test for high-stakes
accountability for individual students in Johnston County. Students
in grades three through eight must score at grade level or better
to be promoted, with exceptions allowed on appeal. High school
students must do the same on state end-of-course tests to get
course credit.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the state is phasing in a similar student accountability
system. The Johnston County system, which includes Selma Elementary
and Smithfield Middle Schools, requires parents to sign a
school-partnership agreement and begin having conferences with
teachers the first month of school. Failure to do so means their
child will be barred from extracurricular activities, won't bring
home a report card and can't have a parking space in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The county, struggling between tobacco farming and industries
not close enough to benefit from the Research Triangle miracle,
used to have a real estate slump because of its schools. Now
schools are driving the real estate market. Student performance has
skyrocketed, even compared to rising scores statewide. The gap in
achievement between black students and all students, which has been
narrowing statewide, has narrowed far more dramatically in Johnston
County. Locally, between '94 and '98, the percent of black students
scoring at or above grade level in math rose from 37 percent to 69
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between this black achievement locally and that of all
students in the state, during the same years, fell from 27
percentile points to only 7 percentile points.
</P>
<P>
   Causby says that critics who complain schools can't show
improvement after two or three years are wrong. Further improvement
simply requires a change in strategy. Once you've moved your
borderline students up to grade level, you have to start teaching
all students in much smaller groups at their various levels. ``It's
wonderful, but no one knew this was going to happen,'' Causby said.
``The thing about the ABC plan is, it's working out to be exactly
what we need, step by step. It was never designed that way. It just
happened.''

 &HT;    Magazine maps genealogy route for families
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everything is relative, it seems, as ``roots mania'' has spread
from county courthouses to the Internet. Nearly 19 million adults
are actively tracing their family histories, according to American
Demographics. Now they'll have more help.
</P>
<P>
   Family Tree ($3.99), a glossy, colorful magazine, debuts this
month with articles about Web sites, scrapbooking, historic travel
and other resources. The January issue (the magazine will be
published bimonthly) offers step-by-step advice on getting started,
preserving family photos and researching arrivals at Ellis Island,
and gives tips from author Homer Hickam Jr. (``October Sky'') on
how to make the chronicle of your life take off like a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Counterfeit chipper: Some of the most prized archaeological
treasures are Clovis points _ the spear tips carved from stones
13,000 years ago by the inhabitants of what is now New Mexico. In
The New Yorker ($3), Douglas Preston locates a Warner Robins man
who can reproduce these exquisite artifacts so faithfully even
experts were fooled. Woody Blackwell, a former counterintelligence
specialist in the Air Force, rediscovered the techniques of rock
``knapping'' after years of trial and error. Under financial
pressure, he began selling his reproductions as genuine. When
Blackwell was finally exposed, in part by his own admission, he
returned all the money. Now he says it all began with a dream in
which he could see a group of Clovis men sitting around a campfire,
telling stories and passing around big, beautiful spear tips. With
every Clovis point he makes, Blackwell says, ``I wonder if this
will be the price of admission, the ticket to let me go back and
sit with those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wolf in the door: The fallout continues from the story that Al
Gore hired controversial feminist author Naomi Wolf to help in his
presidential campaign and, perhaps, convert him from a Beta male to
an Alpha male. Time ($3.50) reports that Gore's female supporters
were surprised and angry to learn that Wolf was being paid $15,000
a month.
</P>
<P>
   Since campaign manager
</P>
<P>
   Donna Brazile found out
</P>
<P>
   about it, that amount has been reduced to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Secret life: Newsweek ($3.50) follows presidential contenders
John McCain and Bill Bradley and explains the candidates are
gaining ground because of their air of authenticity. But the most
intriguing article this week is the profile of Laurie Hiett, the
U.S. Army colonel's wife in Fort Bragg, N.C., who has been charged
with cocaine trafficking. The former high school Spanish teacher
led a double life _ one as a dutiful military spouse, the other as
an associate of an ex-stripper and part-time prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  More than a game: Mother Jones ($3.95) assesses computer games
such as Duke Nukem and Kingpin and finds an astonishing level of
violence. Kids who play graphic games say the violence doesn't
translate into reality. But, says University of Miami professor
Eugene Provenzo, ``We're on a trajectory toward increasing realism,
or hyperreality, that makes people start thinking they can shoot
someone and it doesn't hurt, that they can recover.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Quick reads: Maxim ($3.99) features a revealing photo layout
of actress Jennifer Love Hewitt and a not-so-revealing interview.
We do learn that her biggest vice is Coca-Cola. ... U.S. News &AMP;
World Report ($3.50) picks the best Web sites and reviews the
glitzy new gadgets for the holidays, including the Reebok Traxtar,
electronic shoes that rate kids' athletic performances.

 &HT;    African-American psychiatrists a rare breed
 &HT;    By John Head
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ After a 15-year broadcast journalism career that
included prize-winning work on medical issues, Sandra Clement
Walker decided she could do more good practicing medicine than she
could reporting on it, especially in the mental health field, where
there are few African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Becoming a black psychiatrist made her a rarity: There are only
a few thousand in the United States, according to the National
Association of Black Psychologists. And Walker, 50, is one of only
a few of the country's African-American psychoanalysts in training,
according to the American Psychoanalytic Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle-based psychiatrist is on a three-day visit to
Atlanta sponsored by the Atlanta Foundation for Psychoanalysis.
She'll lead a public discussion of ``Sankofa,'' a film about the
impact of slavery on African-Americans, and will make presentations
to the Emory University Department of Psychiatry and the Morehouse
School of Medicine. Staff writer John Head talked with Walker by
telephone last week.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you hope will be the impact of the first surgeon
general's report on Mental Health, due out this year?
</P>
<P>
   A: It really brings attention to mental health in a way that's
important. The absence of mental health is highly stigmatized in
this country, and it makes it very difficult for people who have
mental and emotional problems to feel comfortable getting care.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So having the surgeon general focus on mental health will
bring changes?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not that simple ... There are a lot of intrinsic,
difficult things about mental illness that make solutions not
simple. But focusing more attention and educating the public more
about mental illness _ about what mental illnesses are, about what
treatments are available _ is going to be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Surgeon General David Satcher has expressed concern over the
``national epidemic'' of suicide, particularly the rising rate
among young African-Americans. What accounts for the increase in
the suicides in this group that traditionally has had a low suicide
rate?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not a guru in that area, but I think the pressures on
kids across the board are very great today. There's a lot of
pressure on kids to do well, to succeed materially. The
opportunities for many kids are not keeping pace with their
expectations ... I don't think there's one answer to that question.
There are many factors that play into the kind of concerns we face
with kids killing themselves. The other big one is access to lethal
things, like guns. That's a big problem.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are there special mental health concerns for
African-Americans who have had to deal with racism?
</P>
<P>
   A: That's a fascinating question, and that's something that I
think about every day in my practice and my work. Racism and the
heritage from slavery in this country have ongoing meanings for
African-Americans and for whites ... Many of the African-American
patients I work with have experienced narcissistic injury _ injury
to their sense of self _ as a result of racism ... For
African-Americans who are seeking treatment and help, providing a
setting where those issues can come up comfortably is important.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's more important: Bringing in more African-American
mental health-care providers or training all providers to take into
account cultural differences in deciding on how to treat patients?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's not either/or. It really has to be both. Having more
minority providers is complicated, but important ... Since that
isn't going to happen overnight _ and maybe never will happen _
it's important to help other providers understand the needs of
African-American and minority patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sankofa,'' by Ethiopian filmmaker Haile Gerima, will be shown
and discussed at 8 tonight in the Emory University Geosciences
Building, 1557 Pierce Drive Information about the movie is
available at www.sankofa.com. The discussion is free and open to
the public.

 &HT;    Five things to know about mold
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mold isn't just the stuff that grows on stale bread and old
cheese. Microscopic mold spores can trigger allergies and worsen
asthma, especially during the fall season. A few varieties are even
toxic. Here are some tips on how to reduce mold in your home.
</P>
<P>
   1. Mold likes wet places. So keep your house dry. In your
bathroom, run the exhaust vent while bathing or showering and for
at least 15 minutes afterward. If you don't have a vent in the
bathroom, open a window to let out moist air. (Generally, though,
windows should stay closed.) Fix cracked basement walls and leaky
pipes. Damp wallboard, wet carpets and even wet cardboard boxes
also are havens for mold. If flooding occurs, dry out everything as
quickly as possible. Once mold gets inside walls, it's very
difficult to eliminate.
</P>
<P>
   2. Keep windows closed. And use a dehumidifier.
</P>
<P>
   3. If you're sensitive to mold, find someone who isn't to mow
your lawn and rake leaves. Those activities can stir up mold
spores.
</P>
<P>
   4. Store firewood outside. Don't keep too many plants indoors _
mold likes wet soil.
</P>
<P>
   5. If you want to clean up mold yourself, wear a special mask
such as a respirator or a HEPA filter mask that will filter out
mold spores. Scrub _ don't scrape _ at mold patches, using a
solution of 1 cup of chlorine bleach to 1 gallon of water.
</P>
<P>
   Major mold problems may require professional cleaning. Look in
the Yellow Pages under ``Flood Control Equipment and Services.''

 &HT;    With first major film role, Usher does it his way
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Usher Raymond IV has never been a high school student.
He has never had a close relationship with his father. And he's
more likely to lead people to dance than revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in ``Light It Up,'' in theaters Wednesday, the 21-year-old
plays a crusading high school student whose bond with his father is
shattered by a policeman's bullet. (Raymond describes his
relationship with his biological father as ``basically
nonexistent.'') His character, Lester, leads an uprising of
students fed up with conditions in their high school. For Raymond,
this is acting.
</P>
<P>
   While his peers were in algebra and gym class, Raymond _ who
attended school through eighth grade and finished his education
with tutors _ was developing a recording career with Atlanta-based
LaFace Records. His self-titled 1994 debut hit the respectable
500,000 mark, but its 1997 follow-up, ``My Way,'' hit big. The 4
million-selling album earned him a Grammy Award nomination, the
distinction of being named Billboard magazine's artist of the year
and widespread attention both inside and outside the music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (we) first saw him, we saw the star potential,'' says
Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds, co-president of Raymond's label and
executive producer of ``Light It Up.'' ``We just had this feeling
that whatever direction he took, he would be a force in the
entertainment business.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymond also has become a businessman. He has a deal to write
and produce for other artists. He has his own record label, Us
Records. And he and his mother and manager, Jonnetta Patterson, run
J-Pat Management.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Doraville office of J-Pat that we learned how
Raymond is managing his three pursuits:
</P>
<P>
   Q: How have you prepared for being an actor?
</P>
<P>
   A: For earlier roles like on (television's) ``Moesha,'' I just
applied things from my life. I had a girlfriend who studied theater
at Spelman College, and I would use little things that she told me.
Outside of that, I had an acting coach for this role. And I didn't
go into it with fear. I prayed to God like, ``I know I've never
done this, but just give me the strength to go in here and present
myself as professionally as I possibly can.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What did being in the movies ``The Faculty'' and ``She's All
That'' do for you as an actor?
</P>
<P>
   A: It gave me experience.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In those small roles we didn't get a sense of whether you
could act or not, did we?
</P>
<P>
   A: I think people were deceived. Because of the way they
promoted (``The Faculty''), they made it seem like it was my movie.
But now I finally have a leading role. And there's others to come.
I've done another film called ``Texas Rangers'' (with James Van Der
Beek of ``Dawson's Creek'' and Dylan McDermott of ``The
Practice''). And for television I've done ``Geppetto'' with Drew
Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In ``Light It Up'' though, your character really has to
exhibit a range of emotions, doesn't he?
</P>
<P>
   A: And I really had to pull from a lot of mine. Some things ...
some things I would ... like my relationship with my father, I
would apply that to the relationship that Lester has with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Can you characterize your relationship with your father?
</P>
<P>
   A: Basically it was shattered at a young age. Unfortunately, my
father wasn't mature enough to be there for his child. But I had
someone who was there and believed in me, and that was God. He
placed people in my life that made me believe in myself. And my
mother was the main person. I've spoken to my father. We're sort of
building a rapport with each other. But more or less we're just
trying to have conversations, because what do we have in common
other than he's my father and I'm his son? Those are titles with no
real meaning. I did have a stepfather, who was a great guy. He
taught me a lot.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Another thing that distinguishes Lester from Usher on-screen
is that Lester has a hard times with the girls, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: (Laughs.) That's one of the things I liked about the
character. I just wanted it to be cute like, ``Aw, he likes her.
And she won't give him a chance.'' I didn't want to seem too sexy,
sexual, you know, licking my lips (like) ``What's up baby? How you
feeling?''
</P>
<P>
   Q: You didn't want to be the guy on the cover of Vibe?
</P>
<P>
   A: With the shirt off, the water running down my chest and the
whole nine? Naw.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Are you done with that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Am I done with it? Well, I know people say every time Usher
is on TV he's taking his clothes off. But a lot of people go
through that. Marvin Gaye went through that for a while. He was
dropping his pants and taking off his shirt for a while because he
knew how to give the crowd what they wanted. And as an entertainer,
that's what your job is.
</P>
<P>
   But sometimes you have to reserve something for yourself. And
I'm being a little more cautious now because I have a broader
audience. I have younger kids watching me, looking up to me and
listening closely to what I'm singing about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does acting do for you that singing doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   A: It allows me to have multiple personalities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What does singing do for you that acting doesn't?
</P>
<P>
   A: With singing, you have more of a direct connection. You speak
directly to the souls of people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you think ``Light It Up'' will connect with teenagers?
Afraid it may start some copycat school takeovers?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. I think this movie clearly says these are mostly smart
kids who made a dumb move. I think because some of the situations
are so real to life _ police harassment, overflowing classes,
schools being in bad shape and so on _ hopefully it will really hit
home. But no, I don't think kids will leave home and light up their
schools.

   SCOTUS-DEATH-PENALTY (Washington) _ A roundup: The Supreme
Court, split over the issue, decides not to take a case that raised
the question of whether a very long delay between a sentence of
death and execution is itself cruel and unusual punishment. The
court does agree to take other cases. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-INSURE (Undated) _ Taking a dramatic step to break
with one of the most onerous features of managed care, United
Health Group, one of the biggest health insurance companies, said
on Monday that it is giving up its veto power over medical decision
making. United said that now doctors, not company people, would
decide when any of its 8.7 million members need hospital or other
treatment. Industry experts said United's policy change would be
followed by other companies as health insurers battle to quell the
backlash against managed care in Congress and the states. By Milt
Freudenheim.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-WALL (Berlin) _ Virtually nobody predicted the fall of
the Berlin Wall _ and apparently nobody planned it. As a result,
two German states with divergent ideologies and cultures found
themselves propelled toward union on the panicky reaction of a
border guard who opened the gate at Berlin's Bornholmerstrasse
crossing without an explicit order to do so. Some of the effects of
that precipitation are still evident today. Most fundamentally, a
united Germany is not quite sure of its identity. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   AFGHAN-REBEL (Khwaja Bahaouddin, Afghanistan) _ The Lion of the
Panjshir is not a big man, especially so for someone thought to be
Afghanistan's greatest guerrilla fighter. With his beret cocked to
the side and his brow in a pensive wrinkle, he has the look of a
beat generation poet, more at home in a basement coffee house than
in high-altitude combat. This nation, so poor otherwise, is rich
with storied commanders, bearded chieftains loping through the
mountains, stopping only to praise Allah or to set an ambush. But
among them, only the Lion _ Ahmed Shah Massoud _ is left to fight
on against the Taliban militia, the others all killed or chased
into exile or bought off with cash. By Barry Bearak.

<P>
   BUSH-ENVIRON (Austin, Texas) _ Early this summer, with political
pressure mounting on him to address his state's abysmal air
pollution problems, Gov. George W. Bush signed a law he regards as
the gold star of his green resume: a program targeting outdated
industrial plants that are among the heaviest polluters in Texas.
For Bush, who began his business career in the oil fields of West
Texas, the program meant confronting the state's oil, gas and
chemical industries that are among his most generous campaign
contributors. With the new law, Bush now boasts that he is the
first Texas governor ``to ever have brought industry together and
said, `Get into compliance.''' But what he actually did was a
little different. By Jonathan Yardley. 3,200 words.
</P>
<P>
   WEB-ENTERTAINMENT (Los Angeles) _ Regis and Kathie Lee, watch
out. The hosts of a new talk show are none other than the Lord and
Satan themselves. In ``The God &AMP; Devil Show,'' they interview
guests like John Wayne _ one needn't be alive to be a guest on this
show _ and viewers then vote whether to send the guest to heaven or
hell. A growing number of players, from big studios to small
entrepreneurs, are starting to provide entertainment on the Web,
either by delivering existing movies and television shows or by
creating programs specifically for online viewing. By Andrew
Pollack. 2,100 words.
</P>
<P>
   SCHOOL-BUS-DRIVERS (Denver) _ A national shortage of school bus
drivers, caused by the roaring economy and a rise in the school-age
population, is making students wait up to an hour for a ride,
delaying and canceling field trips and athletic events, and forcing
mechanics, transportation supervisors and even some classroom
teachers to get behind the wheel. By Jodi Wilgoren. 1,900 words.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ Having guarded the ramparts of East German communism
for 28 years, Harald Jaeger knew his business at the Berlin Wall.
So the statement by the Politburo member on television on that
night _ Nov. 9, 1989 _ struck him as lunacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the words were clear enough. Guenter Schabowski,
representing the communist state's highest authority, said that
East Germans were free to travel ``without meeting special
provisions'' and that the new rule would go into effect
``immediately.''

   Jaeger, then a 46-year-old lieutenant colonel in the East German
border guards, almost choked on his sandwich. ``On the one hand, I
knew what the party said was law,'' he said recently. ``On the
other, I was commanding a critical border post, and nobody had
alerted us to any change of policy.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, it is clear that Jaeger's confusion was widely
shared. Virtually nobody predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall, and
apparently nobody planned it. At its most sensitive point, the
Soviet empire imploded, undone by economic decay and by Mikhail
Gorbachev's renunciation of the force ultimately needed to hold it
together.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, two German states with utterly divergent ideologies
and cultures found themselves propelled toward union on the panicky
reaction of a border guard, Jaeger, who opened the gate at Berlin's
Bornholmerstrasse crossing, in the absence of instructions about
what to do. Some of the effects of that precipitation are still
evident today.
</P>
<P>
   Most fundamentally, a united Germany is not quite sure of its
identity. ``Is Germany a great power?'' the weekly magazine Der
Spiegel asked this week on the cover of its issue commemorating the
10th anniversary of the wall's fall. The image above the question:
a German eagle borne aloft by the Brandenburg Gate's winged goddess
of Victory.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder recently answered the question in
the affirmative, calling Germany a ``great European power.'' On one
level, even though the country has no nuclear bomb, he is clearly
right.
</P>
<P>
   The German economy is one-third bigger than any other in Europe.
And in a potent symbol of the country's post-Cold War emancipation,
a German general now commands allied forces in Kosovo, something
unthinkable even five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the nature of that power, and of a new German patriotism, is
less clear because German unity abruptly brought together in a
single state zealous Communists like Jaeger, mild West Germans
anxious to escape German identity by calling themselves
``Europeans'' and some East Germans with strong nationalistic
feelings for a united Germany.
</P>
<P>
   What seems evident, a decade after the wall's fall, is that the
broad postwar consensus around the ``constitutional patriotism''
proposed by the prominent intellectual Juergen Habermas has eroded.
This, in essence, was an almost abstract German patriotism built on
values like free speech and the rule of law _ those that the Nazis
had trampled.
</P>
<P>
   In its place is a jumble. Hans-Peter Mueller, a political
scientist, said, ``The reference point of `never again' to the
Holocaust still exists, but alongside it we have the patriotic
nostalgia of those who feel they lost their state in the East, the
right-wing radicalism of the frustrated and some conservative
attempts to lift German taboos.''
</P>
<P>
   The project of the last decade has been the unification of a
highly developed Western country that is ashamed of its past and
rooted in NATO with a crumbling East German state raised to believe
it had fought an anti-fascist struggle against Hitler and to see
NATO as its mortal enemy. Given the dimensions of the task,
difficulties were inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   But most Germans of east and west now agree that, however great
the achievements of the last decade, there were also mistakes that
increased the difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Among them were the headlong economic reforms that left about 20
percent of eastern Germans unemployed, a failure in the west to
come up with gestures to soften the eastern sense of being taken
over and the too-easy promises that suggested to eastern Germans
that capitalism was a code word for get-rich-quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have paid for having no plan,'' said Willi Heidemann, the
top administrative official in Jerxheim, a town that once stood
just west of the border. ``West Germany's Constitution made clear
from 1949 that the aim was unification, but it was an aim without a
project right up to the last moment. Nobody believed that border
would disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Least of all Jaeger, who became a border guard when the wall _
102.7 miles of a barrier encircling West Berlin _ went up in 1961
to stanch the flow of about 2,000 people a day fleeing to the West.
</P>
<P>
   He believed in socialism; he believed that the people on the
western side of the wall were his ``class enemy.'' Because East
Germany was independent, he considered it that state's right to
protect its borders as it saw fit, even after the killing of more
than 450 people who had tried to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky I was never placed in that situation, but
believing what I believed then, I too would have shot anyone trying
to flee,'' said Jaeger, who now runs a small newspaper store in
Berlin. ``At the same time, by that night in 1989, I could see that
we were directionless, that the leadership had lost control.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the summer of 1989, though, thousands of East
Germans had been escaping through Hungary's newly opened borders
with the West without any response from Moscow. In East Germany, on
Oct. 18, Egon Krenz eased out Erich Honecker, the autocrat who had
governed since 1971. But the new leadership could not control
mounting street demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz visited Moscow on Oct. 31 and met Gorbachev, who made
clear that the Soviet leadership opposed German unification, but
also that it opposed any use of force. The people, Gorbachev said,
should not be regarded as an enemy; on the contrary, policies
should be found to bring them around.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Jaeger said, he received instructions several days
before Nov. 9 that force should not be used on any account. But as
to what he should do if a crowd came toward his command post at the
wall, there was silence.
</P>
<P>
   In the early evening, shortly after Schabowski's televised news
conference, about 10 or 15 people gathered in front of Jaeger,
shouting that the party had declared they were free to travel
``immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaeger was at a loss. What these people said was true. But he
had no instructions, and, like many in the East, he had spent his
life obeying orders.
</P>
<P>
   So he called his superior, Col. Rudi Ziegenhorn, to ask what to
do. The following conversation, as Jaeger recalled it, ensued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hear that nonsense on television?'' Ziegenhorn asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that's why I'm calling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many are there in front of you?''
</P>
<P>
   ``About 15.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the law _ send them back,'' Ziegenhorn concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The group of soldiers under Jaeger's command tried to do just
that, but more people kept arriving, and unwilling to threaten
force, the border guards had no means of coercion. An attempt to
persuade people to go to their local police stations to obtain
visas backfired when a few went, found the stations closed, and
returned more determined to cross.
</P>
<P>
   About a half-hour later, Ziegenhorn called back, saying that the
people he described as ``provocateurs'' _ essentially those
shouting loudest _ should be allowed out to the West, but that the
photographs on their passports should be stamped with the
understanding that they would not be allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to open the valve a little and relieve the
tension through what amounted to selective expulsions,'' Jaeger
said. ``But the idea proved disastrous because people got the
impression that if they shouted loudly enough, they would be
allowed out.''
</P>
<P>
   So the commander of the Bornholmerstrasse section of the wall
called his superior again. Colonel Ziegenhorn had meanwhile spoken
to his superior, the deputy minister of state security, Gerhard
Neiber, to see if anyone knew what should be done. Apparently no
one did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ziegenhorn told me that there were no more orders, nothing
else to say,'' Jaeger said. ``In effect, I was on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   By 10:30 p.m., that isolation was becoming increasingly painful.
Thousands were in the street, pressing forward. The soldiers under
his command were urging him to make a decision. ``But,'' Jaeger
said, ``that wall was my life. I'd defended it for 28 years. It was
not like kicking over a bucket.''
</P>
<P>
   For about another 30 minutes, Jaeger wavered, torn between fear
of a violent catastrophe and terror of opening up a wall he
regarded as his. But with the pressure from the crowd mounting
constantly, he gave the order, shortly after 11 p.m., to open the
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not free Europe, or release my people, or any of that
nonsense,'' Jaeger said. ``It was that crowd in front of me, and
the hopeless confusion of my leadership, that opened those gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by what he had done, Jaeger hesitated to call
Ziegenhorn back. But eventually he informed his superior of his
decision. ``Das ist gut, mein Junge,'' _ ``You did right, young
man'' _ was the cursory reply.
</P>
<P>
   So ended East Germany, the division of Europe, the Cold War, and
around the globe, much else that, for good or ill, had depended on
the global struggle between capitalism and communism. Jaeger's long
career as a border guard also ended, of course.
</P>
<P>
   As for millions of eastern Germans, unemployment followed for
him and for his wife, and a long struggle to adjust to the values
of a society he had long opposed.
</P>
<P>
   Many thousands of eastern Germans moved from the east to the
west. But while there is still a lot of migration each year, an
increasing number of western Germans also move to the east. Last
year, the Federal Statistics Office reported, 182,000 Germans moved
from east to west, 30,000 more than moved in the opposite
direction.
</P>
<P>
   Jaeger stayed in Berlin, and finally, in 1997, he was able to
borrow the money so that he and his wife could start a newspaper
store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I'm a capitalist,'' he said. ``I exploit my wife,
and she exploits me. That's our capitalism. But I listen to the
people in the store worrying about jobs for their children, and I
still have my doubts about this system.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. ``Wir sind das Volk'' _ ``We are the people'' _
was the cry of East German protesters in 1989. Today, a large, sad
banner hangs at the Alexanderplatz, the former center of East
Berlin, saying: ``Wir waren das Volk'' _ ``We were the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, stalls sell T-shirts emblazoned with the German eagle
and the bold word: ``Deutschland.'' Between the nostalgic
disillusionment of that banner and the patriotism of that shirt, a
united Germany struggles today to define itself.

HEIRLOOM PARQUET FLOOR HEADED FOR RETIREMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Another sporting heirloom soon will become a memory.
</P>
<P>
   The famed parquet floor, as synonymous with Celtic basketball as
Larry Bird or Bill Russell, is nearing an end. A replacement floor
is being sought for the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we've looked at for a while,'' said FleetCenter
spokesman Jim Delaney. ``Nothing has been done for sure yet. But we
are actively looking at different samples to replace it.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, the Celtics and the FleetCenter have
explored the possibility of replacing the crosscut oak floor that
is as old as the National Basketball Association. There were rumors
last summer that a new floor would be installed by the opening of
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That deadline has already passed,'' said Delaney. ``But it
might be something to look at for the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, the new floor will not be an exact copy of the
current floor, which consists of 247 panels, measuring 5 feet by 5
feet, held together with 988 bolts.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the samples that have been brought to the FleetCenter
for examination are much bigger, some 4 feet by 9 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever is done, we'd like there to be a continuity with the
Celtic tradition,'' said Delaney.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Pitino, the team president and coach, said he knew nothing
about the floor being replaced.
</P>
<P>
   The floor currently in use at the FleetCenter was brought over
from the Boston Garden when that building was closed in 1995. It is
the only basketball floor that has been graced by every current NBA
Hall of Famer who ever dribbled in the 53 years of the league's
existence.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Garden dates to 1928, it wasn't opened with the
intention of hosting basketball games, so it wasn't until 1946 that
original Celtics owner Walter Brown had the floor built by the East
Boston Lumber Co.
</P>
<P>
   The floor was built from oak scraps crosscut from a forest in
Tennessee for a cost of about $11,000. It had to be manufactured in
that unusual fashion because of a shortage of materials following
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its unique pattern, the floor is famous for its alleged
``dead spots'' _ areas where the basketball doesn't bounce the way
it should.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of dead spots,'' said Delaney. ``The old floor
isn't what it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   When the parquet floor is finally retired, you can expect some
of it to wind up at the Basketball Hall of Fame in Springfield.
Much of it is expected to be cut up and sold as memorabilia.

CELTICS SIGN DOUG OVERTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Hello, Doug Overton; goodbye, Wayne Turner.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics made a move to add depth and experience to their
backcourt Monday by signing Overton, 30, an NBA journeyman who has
played 351 games with five teams over the last seven years. To make
room on the roster, the Celtics released Turner, 23, a free agent
rookie who grew up in Boston and had a starry career at the
University of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's inexperience and inability to play at the NBA level
were exposed during Dana Barros's absence. He appeared in three
games and averaged 1.3 points, 1.7 assists and 1.0 rebound, in 41
total minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne needs experience and playing time,'' said coach Rick
Pinto, ``either with another team that has one or two point guards
or in the CBA, where he can play 35 or 38 minutes a game. We're
very interested in Wayne in the future. But playing no minutes or
one or two minutes is not going to get him any experience to grow
as a basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics have been looking for help at point guard for a
while and contacted Overton's agent last week. Overton's contract
is not a 10-day deal; it's for the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, he expected to be playing in his hometown of
Philadelphia. Overton went to training camp with the Sixers but was
cut Oct. 28, just days before the start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised when they let me go,'' said Overton, a La
Salle graduate. ``I sort of got caught in a numbers game. But I've
been in this business and in this situation before. You just got to
look at it for what it's worth and move on. Some things you can't
control.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitino considers Overton an insurance policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is experience,'' said the coach. ``We need
somebody so that if Kenny (Anderson) rolls his ankle for five games
and he's out, we need an experienced point guard and keep Dana with
the second unit.''
</P>
<P>
   Overton understands that he is behind Anderson and Barros.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm going to be ready,'' he said. ``Injuries happen.
Different things happen when you get your opportunity. Just got to
be ready to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played a lot of minutes in this league,'' said Pitino.
``And we got great reports about his attitude, his desire to work,
and everything checked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waited for a veteran to become available. We wanted to give
Wayne a good look and we're interested in his future. But it's best
for him and best for us that he gets some experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Overton originally was drafted by the Pistons in the second
round (40th overall) in 1991. His best year in the NBA was with
Washington in 1994-95, when he appeared in 82 games, averaging 7.0
points, 3.0 assists, and 1.7 rebounds. He split the abbreviated
1999 season with Orlando, New Jersey, and Philadelphia, averaging
3.8 points in 24 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' said Overton. ``I've been around with quite a
few teams in the league. It's a fresh new start and the team's off
to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Overton will be reunited with former teammates Pervis Ellison
and Calbert Cheaney. He also played with Marty Conlon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty's been everywhere,'' joked Overton. ``Who hasn't played
with Marty?''
</P>
<P>
   He brings to the Celtics a go-go attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how the NBA game is played,'' said Overton. ``I've been
around. This is my eighth year. Whether I play three minutes or 30
minutes, I'm going to go out there and scrap. I'll play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Overton has accepted the idea of being a journeyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to never get down when things are
tough, and I'm the type of guy that's fighting for my life every
year,'' he said. ``I know that, so that's how I play every day. I
come out and I play hard and I leave everything out there, and
whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   He is looking forward to playing for Pitino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he plays a lot of guys and he gets them in there
fast,'' said Overton. ``I hope to get some minutes. You've always
got to be ready for him to throw you into a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Overton, who worked out with the Celtics Monday morning, will
wear No. 20, last worn by Marlon Garnett. Picking up the offensive
system shouldn't be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in this division for most of my career,'' he said.
``So I've been in the middle of a lot of the plays on the defensive
end, so I know the calls and know what they are running.
Defensively, I think that will be the adjustment, with all the
trapping and different signals, but I'll pick it up.''

ARCH COMMUNICATIONS TO BUY PAGENET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arch Communications Group Inc., the Westborough, Mass. number
two-ranked US paging company, agreed Monday to buy its larger rival
Paging Network Inc. of Dallas for $1.36 billion in an effort to
fend off fierce competition from wireless phone companies and a
possible PageNet bankruptcy filing.
</P>
<P>
   The companies hope to wipe out $1.6 billion in debt and
preferred shares by exchanging them for common stock. Arch will
also swap its stock for PageNet shares at a price 12 percent below
Friday's close, but PageNet warned it will file for Chapter 11
bankruptcy unless enough shareholders and bondholders accept the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will continue to be called Arch and remain based
in Westborough. It expects to save $80 million over the first two
years after the deal closes in mid-2000 and enjoy gross revenues of
$1.7 billion annually, with positive free cash flow before taxes,
depreciation and amortization.
</P>
<P>
   The paging industry has been struggling in recent years as more
than 70 million Americans have come to own wireless phones, some of
which now include paging capabilities or are used as a
direct-calling alternative to paging. Arch bought bankrupt paging
company MobileMedia Corp. in April, one of 34 companies it has
acquired to build a nationwide footprint.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in PageNet, which have plunged 78 percent this year,
gained 1/16 to close at 1 1/32 in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Arch
shares, which have climbed 43 percent, shed 5/8 in Nasdaq trading
to close at 6 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best of poor alternatives,'' Sean Egan, a managing
director at bond rating firm Egan-Jones Ratings Co., told Bloomberg
News. ``It's either this or Chapter 11, where the legal costs will
eat up what's left'' of PageNet.
</P>
<P>
   The companies would combine under a complex deal that requires
shareholder and regulatory approval and involves:
</P>
<P>
   --Arch exchanging 12.47 of its shares for every 100 PageNet
common shares, worth about 85 cents per PageNet share.
</P>
<P>
   --PageNet bondholders owning 44.5 percent of the combined
company, or just over $500 million in stock. PageNet has $1.2
billion in senior notes and $804 million in bank debt.
</P>
<P>
   --Arch investors swapping $384 million in senior notes and $28
million in preferred shares for common stock, which with the
PageNet debt swap would reduce the combined company's total debt to
$1.8 billion, down 46 percent from current levels.
</P>
<P>
   --PageNet stock and note holders will get an 80.5 percent stake
in its Vast Solutions unit, a business wireless services operation
that is to be spun off as a freestanding company. Shareholders in
the new Arch will own the other 19.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Both Arch and PageNet serve all 50 states. Arch has 7 million
pagers in service, while PageNet has 9.7 million, but has never
turned a profit since it went public in 1991. Arch officials hope
to grow profits by moving into two-way paging and other high-value
services such as news and information broadcast to pagers from
Bloomberg, CNN, ESPN and other outlets.
</P>
<P>
   C. Edward Baker Jr., Arch chairman and chief executive, who will
be CEO of the combined company, said, ``We believe the combination
of two very strong distribution vehicles will build a formidable
competitor whose business will extend far beyond the industry's
traditional focus in paging.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Uta Hagen played Martha in the original Broadway
production of Edward Albee's ``Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' in
1962, she placed her galvanic imprint on the role and helped to
define the play.
</P>
<P>
   Something similar occurred at least twice in plays by Tennessee
Williams, with Laurette Taylor in ``The Glass Menagerie'' and
Marlon Brando in ``A Streetcar Named Desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hagen has occasionally returned to other roles, but after
closing in ``Virginia Woolf'' in London in 1964 and making an
original cast recording, she has never again appeared in the play _
until now.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday she will once more assume the mantle of Martha, for
one performance only in a staged reading at the Majestic Theater on
Broadway. The reading will be for the benefit of the HB Playwrights
Foundation (created by Ms. Hagen and her husband, Herbert Berghof)
and in celebration of her 80th-birthday year. Jonathan Pryce will
play opposite her as George (replacing the previously announced
Anthony Hopkins) and Matthew Broderick and Mia Farrow will be Nick
and Honey. Tickets to the event, which will begin at 6 p.m., and
the birthday supper after the performance are available through the
HB Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, Ms. Hagen made it clear she was very
aware of the pitfalls of replaying such a signature role, for which
she won a Tony Award as best actress. ``It's a terrible risk for
me,'' she said. ``I'm 28 years too old for the part. I was 42 when
I played it. Martha's supposed to be 52. People have such
incredible memories of my performance. I don't see how anybody
could possibly live up to it, certainly not me almost 40 years
later.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of challenging herself is pervasive in her career: her
book on the art of acting is called ``A Challenge for the Actor.''
She indicated that her performance would be different, but said she
did not not yet know what direction it would take. Looking back on
her first Martha, she said, ``I remembered what I experienced
playing the role, but I don't remember how it came across.''
</P>
<P>
   The reading was suggested by Robert Callely, the managing
director of the HB Foundation. After Ms. Hagen agreed to take part,
her first step was to reread the play. ``I forgot how vicious
Martha is,'' she said. ``The play is still one body blow after
another. I'd be curious to see how an audience responds to that
now.''
</P>
<P>
   She added quickly that both Martha and George, the mutually
abusive, intimately allied faculty couple, are victims: ``Both
those people have to be in hell. If only one is in hell, the play
is still wonderful, but not as good as it could be.'' Saying that,
she paid tribute to her first George, Arthur Hill (who also won a
Tony Award for his performance) as acting partner.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what qualities an actress needed to play Martha, she
answered, ``Intelligence, voluptuousness and hypersensitivity,''
and then added, ``wit.'' When the question was raised about the
difficulty that Albee and his producer Elizabeth McCann were having
in casting the role for a projected revival, she was unable to name
any actress of the correct age to play the role today. ``I'll wrack
my brains and come up with somebody,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It has often been said that George and Martha are roles of equal
dimension. Ms. Hagen objected: ``If you read it, it's George's
play. The part of George is Hamlet for an actor. It's a great
role.'' Depending on the pairing of the performers, one or the
other can seem to be the stronger character.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virginia Woolf'' is one peak in Ms. Hagen's distinguished and
diverse career. She made her acting debut in 1937 in Dennis, Mass.,
at 17 playing Ophelia to Eva Le Gallienne's Hamlet. ``She pulled it
off,'' she said, ``but I was so in awe of her and so dazzled at
being onstage that I don't remember anything about that
production.'' The following year she was on Broadway as Nina in the
Lunt-Fontanne production of ``The Seagull,'' and then went on to
play Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello. She won her first Tony in
1950 for ``The Country Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   As she developed as an actress, she stressed the fluidity of
performance. ``That's my whole goal as an actress,'' she said,
``the spontaneity that comes without planning.'' From her point of
view, a performance should change in the course of the run,
according to the identity of the other actors, the audience
response and the actress' mood and temperament.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, she replaced Jessica Tandy in the first production of
``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' On Broadway and then on tour, she
played Blanche DuBois opposite Brando, Anthony Quinn, Ralph Meeker,
Richard Kiley and Jack Palance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go on with another actor and your performance doesn't
change, you're a bad actor,'' she said. In the case of
``Streetcar,'' she thought that Quinn gave the finest performance:
``Brando was a stunning actor, but I felt he tipped the play
because he was more sensitive than Blanche.'' In contrast, ``Tony
was a brute and didn't know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hagen savors long runs. ``After a couple of months, it
really starts to get in my bones,'' she said. ``So few actors know
how to keep a part alive, and when you're in a country that's built
on runs and not on repertory, you should know how to do that. For
that, Laurette Taylor was my guide. I went to see her in `Glass
Menagerie' 10 times, 10 different, exciting performances. To me,
that is the magic of the theater.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Sunday's performance of ``Virginia Woolf'' is a reading
with actors holding scripts, she is thinking about beginning the
evening with an entrance, as Martha and George, returning from a
late-night faculty party, stumble into their home in the dark.
Martha's first words, ``Jesus H. Christ,'' are soon followed by her
mimicking Bette Davis saying ``What a dump'' in the movie ``Beyond
the Forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hagen said she had once spoken that line at a benefit to
introduce herself to an unfamiliar audience.
</P>
<P>
   Then she recalled her favorite, other line from ``Beyond the
Forest.'' Davis is out hunting and while lying in the grass shoots
a porcupine out of a sequoia tree. Asked why she did that, she
replies _ and Ms. Hagen did her best Davis imitation _ ``Porkies
make me nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the interview, she had still not thought of a
younger actress who could play a new Martha, and she commented
critically on a few who were reluctant to do so: ``It is such a
challenge that you would think anybody would leap at the chance.
But everybody is so afraid of making the wrong move. Everything is
about the salability of a career rather than doing the work you
love doing.''
</P>
<P>
   If she had any lingering doubt about the decision to return to
Martha, albeit briefly, she could remember a conversation she had
with Dame Sybil Thorndike during the London engagement of
``Virginia Woolf.'' Thorndike played the title role in the London
premiere of ``St. Joan'' in 1924 and periodically revived the play.
In 1951 Ms. Hagen did ``St. Joan'' on Broadway. Thorndike asked her
if she was going to do it again, and Ms. Hagen said that she was
much too old for the part.
</P>
<P>
   Thorndike replied haughtily, ``Too old for St. Joan? You can
only be too young to play St. Joan.''

`DECODING NAZI SECRETS': THE UNBREAKABLE CODE BROKEN IN WORLD WAR
II 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the Battle of Waterloo was won on the playing fields of Eton,
then the Battle of Britain can be said to have been won in the
warrens of Bletchley Park, a mansion 50 miles north of London.
There, early in World War II, when the German blitzkrieg was
sweeping through Europe, a team of British crossword puzzle
whizzes, chess masters, mathematicians, paleontologists and other
brilliant eccentrics contributed to the Allied victory by breaking
a seemingly unbreakable German code.
</P>
<P>
   The story has been told before in bits and pieces, but
``Decoding Nazi Secrets,'' Tuesday night's two-hour ``Nova''
program, relies on recently declassified secrets and the memories
of the code breakers to give the most detailed account of how
intellectual ingenuity helped to foil German assaults in crucial
encounters and incidentally pioneered the age of the computer and
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The German high command had put its trust in Enigma, described
Tuesday night as ``a seemingly invincible code-making machine,'' to
communicate with its worldwide forces. Using a series of electrical
rotors, Enigma was capable of scrambling messages in an
astronomical number of ways. Each day German operators would
receive a new set of instructions on how to set up the wiring for
their transmitters and receivers. Lacking those instructions, the
code breakers at Bletchley were faced with what seemed to be
gibberish.
</P>
<P>
   This account of how inspiration, calculation, counterespionage
and a little bit of luck cracked the puzzle of Enigma makes for an
intriguing two hours. Trying to follow the deductions of the code
detectives, like the visionary Alan Turing, whose thought carried
intimations of the Internet, can be daunting, but the ``Nova''
producers are skilled enough to give even the mathematically
challenged a fair notion of how clues were tracked down as the
Germans kept refining their code-making techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Just keep in mind that no code can be entirely random, which
means that flaws are inherent in even a code as complex as Enigma.
And never forget the human element of simple carelessness, laziness
or routine mindlessness that may give away even the shrewdest code.
</P>
<P>
   (One German operator set his daily rotors to the first three
letters of his name, Walter, and then typed in the first three
letters of the name of his girlfriend, Klara. It was a gift to the
code breakers. Other operators used set phrases like ``Heil
Hitler.'' Missing from the program, told from the Allied point of
view, are insights into the thinking of the overconfident German
code makers as they tried to confound the code breakers.)
</P>
<P>
   Among the achievements based on the Bletchley Park deductions
were the destruction of much of the Italian Navy; a defense against
U-boat attacks on Allied convoys in the North Atlantic; and the
decimation of supply shipments for General Rommel's North African
campaign. One of the code breakers says that the work at Bletchley
Park shortened the war by two years.

JUSTICES REFUSE TO HEAR INMATES' APPEAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court, over the vociferous objection of
one of its justices, refused Monday to hear the appeal of two
inmates who have been on death row for at least 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer, in a written dissent, said the court
should have considered the Florida and Nebraska cases to decide
whether it is ``cruel and unusual punishment'' for states to have a
death sentence hanging over an inmate's head for nearly two
decades. But Justice Clarence Thomas, in a separate writing,
responded that it was not the states but the condemned men who
caused the delay by continually appealing their assigned
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Under its practice, the high court will not consider an appeal
unless four of the nine justices request a hearing. The court did
not disclose whether any other justice joined Breyer in calling on
the court to hear the two cases.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision not to hear an appeal sets no legal
precedent and the justices remain free to consider the issue later.
The dispute between Breyer and Thomas reveals an argument between
justices about the Constitution's Eighth Amendment prohibition on
cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Their public disagreement also stands in contrast to the high
court's quiet refusal Monday to hear the appeal of a Texas man on
death row for a 1993 Dallas-area murder.
</P>
<P>
   Breyer, in a spirited defense of the rights of the condemned,
said long delays between a death sentence and execution can exact a
``frightful toll'' on the inmate, including driving the person
insane. He added that the Constitution's 18th-century authors,
while supporting the death penalty, would have regarded lengthy
delays as cruel and unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to deny the suffering inherent in a prolonged
wait for execution _ a matter which courts and individual judges
have long recognized,'' Breyer said. ``Nor can one justify lengthy
delays by reference to constitutional tradition, for our
Constitution was written at a time when delay between sentencing
and execution could be measured in days or weeks, not decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, however, disagreed with Breyer's view of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incongruous to arm capital defendants with an arsenal of
constitutional claims with which they may delay their executions
and simultaneously to complain when executions are inevitably
delayed,'' Thomas wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the Florida case, Thomas Knight has been on death row since
he was sentenced April 21, 1975, for the shooting deaths of Sydney
and Lillian Gans the previous year. Knight had shot them both once
in the back of the neck.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska inmate, Carey Dean Moore, was sentenced to death
April 14, 1980, for robbing and fatally shooting two Omaha
cabdrivers in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In the Texas case, the justices declined without comment to
consider George Alarick Jones' appeal of his death sentence for the
shooting death of 22-year-old Forest Hall. Hall was found face down
in a ditch with two gunshot wounds to the head.
</P>
<P>
   In his unsuccessful appeal to the justices, Jones claimed that
prosecutors improperly excluded a potential juror from sitting on
the jury. He also argued that the trial judge wrongfully allowed
prosecutors to allege during the penalty phase of the trial that
Jones had killed another person.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals last year rejected these
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In successfully urging the Supreme Court to deny Jones' appeal,
Texas Attorney General John Cornyn argued that the jury selection
was proper and that allegations of another violent crime are valid
to help jurors decide whether a murderer should be executed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admission of all evidence regarding the defendant at capital
sentencing furthers the state's interest in assuring (jury)
consideration of evidence about the individual defendant,'' Cornyn
wrote. ``It is directly relevant to the jury's assessment of future
dangerousness, which is a constitutionally permissible sentencing
criterion.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other high court news, the justices agreed to hear the appeal
of a Mississippi man, 57, who claims he was illegally fired because
of his age.
</P>
<P>
   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans agreed with
Roger Reeves that Sanderson Plumbing Products Inc. had fabricated
legitimate reasons for firing him, such as his alleged failure to
reprimand tardy employees. But the 5th Circuit, which governs
Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, added that Reeves had not proven
that the company fired him because of his age.
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case,
Reeves vs. Sanderson Plumbing Products Inc., by July.

</HEADER>
<BODY>
NTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering replacement
parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries for bypass
surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete heart valve
has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel walls in
sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

COURT PASSES ON `CRUEL AND UNUSUAL' APPEALS OF DEATH-ROW INMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Neb.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The question, as framed for the Supreme Court by
lawyers for death row inmates in Florida and Nebraska, was whether
_ all other arguments about the death penalty aside _ a
decades-long wait for a death sentence to be carried out is itself
so ``cruel and unusual'' as to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   It was a question that the court announced Monday it would not
answer. The justices turned down appeals by two convicted
murderers, one on Nebraska's death row for nearly 20 years, the
other on Florida's for nearly 25. The action left in place a system
under which the length of time a person spends on death row is free
of constitutional scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the prolonged residence on death row was due in
substantial part to the state's response to the inmate's successful
challenge to unconstitutional state procedures; rather than proceed
quickly to new trials, as the lower courts had ordered, the states
spent years appealing the adverse rulings back up through the
judicial system. Eventually, the states prevailed and the inmates
were resentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   While the inmates failed Monday to get the necessary four votes
for review, they undoubtedly got the court's attention. Justice
Stephen Breyer, who wanted the court to hear the appeals, and
Justice Clarence Thomas, who emphatically did not, engaged in an
unusual written exchange that lifted the curtain a bit on the kind
of internal debate over the court's agenda-setting function that
usually remains hidden from public view.
</P>
<P>
   While Breyer stopped short of taking a stand on the merits of
the inmates' claim that their prolonged incarceration violated the
Eighth Amendment, he said their argument ``cannot be rejected out
of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both these cases involve astonishingly long delays flowing in
significant part from constitutionally defective death penalty
procedures,'' Breyer said. He added: ``When a delay, measured in
decades, reflects the state's own failure to comply with the
Constitution's demands, the claim that time has rendered the
execution inhuman is a particularly strong one. I believe this
court should consider that claim now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas vigorously disagreed. ``It is incongruous to arm capital
defendants with an arsenal of `constitutional' claims with which
they may delay their executions, and simultaneously to complain
when executions are inevitably delayed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas named several recent Supreme Court decisions that
expanded the rights of inmates, suggesting that the court's
``Byzantine death penalty jurisprudence'' was responsible for the
long delays through undue solicitude for defendants' rights.
``Consistency would seem to demand that those who accept our death
penalty jurisprudence as a given also accept the lengthy delay
between sentencing and execution as a necessary consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer noted that courts in a number of other countries that
share with the United States the English common-law tradition,
including Jamaica, India and Zimbabwe, have concluded that long
delays are ``inhuman.'' In an unusually modern touch for a Supreme
Court opinion, he gave the Internet address for a decision issued
three months ago by the supreme court of Zimbabwe:
www.law.wits.ac.za/salr/catholic.html. The views of foreign courts
``are useful even though not binding,'' Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas dismissed this line of inquiry. ``Were there any such
support in our own jurisprudence,'' he said, there would be no need
to search for foreign evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The only other justice who entered the discussion was Justice
John Paul Stevens, who offered a one-sentence caution against
extrapolating the court's view on the merits of the issue from its
refusal to hear the cases, Knight vs. Florida, No. 98-9741, and
Moore vs. Nebraska, No. 99-5291.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stevens who had first identified the issue in 1995, when
he called for review of a Texas inmate's claim that 17 years on
death row was cruel and unusual. In that case, Lackey vs. Texas,
Stevens said the question deserved the attention of the state and
lower federal courts. Breyer indicated his agreement in that case
and in a subsequent one from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, dozens of inmates have raised similar claims, none
successfully. Ordinarily, the Supreme Court waits for a conflict to
develop among the lower courts before agreeing to hear a case, and
the absence of such a conflict may have persuaded some justices
against adding the issue to the court's docket.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was another significant development at the court Monday.
The court accepted an appeal under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act that could also determine how other types of job
discrimination cases are handled in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The question is what happens once an employer's explanation for
allegedly discriminatory behavior is shown to be a pretext. Does
the plaintiff then have the right to take the case to a jury? Or is
the company nonetheless entitled to a dismissal of the lawsuit at
this stage if the plaintiff cannot meet the further burden of
producing direct evidence of discriminatory intent, a difficult
legal test known as ``pretext plus''?
</P>
<P>
   This case, Reeves vs. Sanderson Plumbing Products Inc., No.
99-536, is an appeal by a Mississippi man who was fired at age 57
after being told by a supervisor that he was ``too damn old to do
the job.'' After showing that the employer's explanation for his
dismissal was pretextual, he won his age discrimination case before
a federal court jury, which awarded him $98,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans,
overturned the verdict and ruled that the case should have been
dismissed before reaching the jury because the plaintiff, Roger
Reeves, had failed to meet the ``pretext plus'' standard of
providing evidence that his firing resulted from intentional
discrimination.

TWO GENERATIONS OF JAPANESE AMERICANS HELP SHAPE BASEBALL IN S.F. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RYAN KIM  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Not long after Chiura Obata immigrated to San
Francisco in 1903, he fell in love with baseball, the grand pastime
of his new country.
</P>
<P>
   The love affair prompted him to launch the first Japanese
American baseball team on the mainland, which would later inspire
countless more teams throughout California and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It also kept him riveted to his beloved Giants in his later
years.
</P>
<P>
   Now, almost 100 years after Obata's arrival in the city, it is
his 77-year-old son, Gyo Obata, who is leaving his mark on San
Francisco baseball. His St. Louis-based HOK Inc., founded in 1955,
designed Pacific Bell Park, the new home of the Giants scheduled to
open in April.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive red brick structure in China Basin will seat
42,000 fans and is a long-awaited improvement over cold and windy
Candlestick Park. Pacific Bell Park is one of many baseball
stadiums designed by HOK, including Jacobs Field in Cleveland,
Coors Field in Denver and Baltimore's Camden Yards, which Obata
personally helped design.
</P>
<P>
   For the younger Obata, a San Francisco native and former
Japantown resident, the ballpark is a wonderful opportunity to
further his father's passions, both for baseball and for his
favorite team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a sports person, he would have just gone out of his
mind,'' said Obata of his late father. ``He loved going to baseball
games.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese baseball historian Kerry Nakagawa said it's remarkable
to hear the story of the two Obatas, bookends on a century of San
Francisco's baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have this family legacy span two generations and almost a
hundred years and to have both be pivotal pioneers in inspiring
baseball in San Francisco, it's very unique,'' said Nakagawa,
curator of the Diamonds in the Rough exhibit, which chronicles the
birth and growth of Japanese American baseball.
</P>
<P>
   A fine artist, Chiura Obata came to the city in search of work
and a new life. Despite baseball's emerging popularity in Japan at
the time, Obata hadn't played the sport before coming to the
States.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1905, when the Waseda University baseball team from
Japan toured the West Coast, that Obata began looking into forming
a local team for the issei, or first-generation immigrants, said
Gary Otake, a curator with the National Japanese American
Historical Society in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had such a fun time,'' said Otake. ``He just saw this as a
great opportunity for issei to have recreation and play the
national sport of America and Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiura Obata, a pitcher, started the Fuji Athletic Club with a
handful of other immigrants and even helped design their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   They would play games against white and Chinese American teams
at Golden Gate Park and Ewing Field, on the site of the University
of San Francisco's Lone Mountain campus, and were soon joined by
another Japanese American team, the Kanagawa Doshi Club.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, baseball provided the immigrants with a
chance to showcase their love of America and their prowess on the
field, Nakagawa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Putting on the baseball uniforms was like putting on the
American flag,'' Nakagawa said. ``But they really wanted to show
how well they could compete and knew the game.''
</P>
<P>
   During the '20s and '30s, as the Japanese immigrants in San
Francisco started fanning out to find agriculture jobs in the
Central Valley, baseball teams began popping up in Fresno,
Stockton, Lodi and Sacramento. Many of those teams still flourish
today, filled with third-and fourth-generation Japanese Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But while baseball's popularity among Japanese Americans took
off, Chiura Obata focused his attention on his professional
calling, taking an art professorship at UC-Berkeley in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   He was recognized as one of the foremost Japanese
watercolorists, helping introduce the art form to many on the West
Coast. He and his wife, Haruko, a Japanese floral designer, were
later awarded emperor's medals for improving relations between the
United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Gyo Obata didn't pursue organized sports the way his father did,
preferring instead to play impromptu street games in Japantown. In
his teens, his studies demanded all of his time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, after his freshman year as an architecture student at
UC- Berkeley, Gyo Obata's Japanese lineage threatened to derail his
promising future. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor,
more than 100,000 people of Japanese descent were ordered to
evacuate the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   While his family was forced to relocate to an internment camp in
Utah, Gyo Obata managed at the last minute to get accepted to
Washington University in St. Louis, where he could continue his
studies. He still recalls the absurdity of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was absolutely foolish that just because you had
Japanese blood, you have to be put in these camps,'' Obata said.
``Everyone thought this was so crazy, that it wouldn't last very
long.''
</P>
<P>
   The family would be reunited in St. Louis. After the war, Chiura
Obata returned to Berkeley to resume his teaching while Gyo Obata
remained in the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the upheaval caused by the West Coast evacuation of
Japanese Americans, Gyo Obata said the ordeal opened doors for him
and paved the way for his success. In 1955, Gyo Obata started HOK
in St. Louis with two other Washington University graduates,
something that would never have occurred had Obata not been pushed
to the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really opened up a whole new world for me,'' said Obata,
who is chairman of the company.
</P>
<P>
   The firm is now the world's largest architectural design
company, employing about 1,800 people on three continents. In
recent years, it has made a name for itself with its HOK Sport
division, which has built most of the new ballparks across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   After the Giants moved to San Francisco, Chiura Obata became one
of the team's most devoted fans. During the early '60s, he attended
Saturday games at Candlestick, cheering on the likes of Willie Mays
and Juan Marichal.
</P>
<P>
   Chiura Obata died in 1975, long before San Francisco began
looking into replacing Candlestick. Gyo Obata said he plans to
attend the opening of Pac Bell Park in April and his thoughts will
likely turn to his father.
</P>
<P>
   He said he's certain his father would have loved to take in a
game at the Giants' new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have loved it,'' Obata said.

CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY AND MIT IN JOINT RESEARCH VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Pa., Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeking to import a measure of New World innovation and
technology to the Old World, the British government announced a
$108 million investment Monday in a joint venture that will link
research and educational programs at Cambridge University in
England with those at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge-MIT Institute, as the new enterprise will be
known, will seek to develop new technologies, products and
companies to improve the productivity and competitiveness of
British manufacturing industries, officials of the two universities
said .
</P>
<P>
   The new institute will receive 80 percent of its planned $135
million budget over the next five years from the British
government, with the remaining $27 million to be raised from
British industry. Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer,
announced the agreement Monday in London.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is unusual in several ways, according to education
experts. While universities often establish joint research
programs, rarely do those efforts receive any significant
investment up front. Equally rare are programs in which a foreign
government pays for the expertise of an American university and its
faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``The aim is not so much to develop specific technologies as to
enhance the culture of entrepreneurship at Cambridge and the
understanding of how a university can work with industry,'' Charles
Vest, the president of MIT, said. ``We will be giving them access
to our decade and a half of experience working to couple
engineering and management and working in partnership with
industries on manufacturing, product development and industrial
competitiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Zemsky, director of the Institute for Research in Higher
Education at the University of Pennsylvania, said the agreement
demonstrated how universities, like private industries, are trying
to adjust to a more competitive world. ``We're seeing the emergence
of a world market for name-brand education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But, Zemsky added, the Cambridge-MIT Institute seems to have a
built-in advantage. ``The key is that the British government seems
to be putting real money on the table,'' he said. ``These types of
joint ventures are more often formed out of goodwill but with no
real money behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cambridge-MIT Institute's activities will also include
exchanges of undergraduates, graduate students and faculty members
between the two universities, which will build computer and other
technological links to foster the development of virtual classrooms
that span the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is a preliminary one, Vest said, with many
important details to be worked out. Among them are what
compensation, if any, the British government will receive if the
research projects undertaken by the new institute result in
technologies or products that can be licensed or sold for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Vest said that he did not believe that the programs undertaken
by the new institute would trigger controls on exports of American
technology. ``We have informed a few people in the federal
government that this was under discussion, and we received a very
positive reaction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Vest said, the benefits would flow to American
students and industries as well as to those in Britain. ``We're
aiming to build a better global basis of education for MIT students
and the people who will lead businesses in this country in the
future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Alec Broers, the vice chancellor of the University of
Cambridge, said the joint venture with MIT could ``create
entrepreneurs who can use their inspiration and perspiration to
build a stronger British economy.'' He added, ``They could change
the face of entrepreneurship and wealth creation in the UK.''
</P>
<P>
   MIT has extensive experience working with for-profit companies
to develop new methods of engineering and manufacturing, and the
university's faculty members, students and alumni have had a hand
in the founding of more than 4,000 companies. According to a 1997
study by the university, those companies employed more than 1.1
million people and, in 1994 alone, generated $232 billion of sales
around the world.

is ``a banner year'' for enrolling first-year black students at
Texas's public law schools, but 90 percent of them are attending
one
chool -- historically black Texas Southern University, state higher
education officials say.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Educators say the scant enrollment of blacks at predominantly
white law schools shows how the end of affirmative action in
college admissions still hampers minority enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 212 blacks are first-year law students among the four
state-supported schools. In 1997, only 159 blacks began law
studies. That was a year after Texas colleges dropped race as an
admissions factor because of a reverse-discrimination court ruling
against the University of Texas law school. The case is being
appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, 6 percent of first-year black law students in Texas
are attending the University of Houston law school. Elsewhere, 3
percent enrolled at UT law school, and 1 percent enrolled at Texas
Tech University's law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that these schools are still struggling with
minority recruitment,'' said Lynn Rodriguez, general counsel for
the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees
public colleges.

 &HT;    Bradley says Gore failed to fight for health care
 &HT;    (EDS: Adds paragraphs.)
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The fault line between Vice President Al Gore and
presidential rival Bill Bradley over health care reform widened
Monday as each sought to undercut the other on a crucial issue for
Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Bradley told a meeting of public health
professionals that Gore abandoned health care reform after the
Clinton administration lost a fight for universal care in 1994.
Bradley criticized Gore while outlining a proposal to invest $2
billion in public health, including a $1 billion infusion to the
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Gore appeared at a pharmacy to propose new laws
that would make cheaper, generic drugs more readily available to
consumers. Gore's campaign also trumpeted a new study by an Emory
University expert that found Bradley's proposal for near-universal
health care insurance would be more expensive than he claimed.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of what to do about the nation's 46 million
uninsured has become the primary point of friction between the two
Democrats since their first town hall meeting nearly two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-New Jersey senator largely dismissed Gore's criticisms of
his health care plan as partisan snipping, but on Monday Bradley
shifted tactics and went on the offensive. He accused Gore of
falling victim to the ``Beltway perspective ... that (says) if you
try something once and fail, move on to another issue that polls
better or is safer to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley even used some of Gore's rhetoric against him. When the
candidates appeared together in Iowa last month, Gore accused
Bradley of abandoning the Democratic Party and refusing to ``stay
and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of health care, Al Gore decided it wasn't worth
standing and fighting,'' Bradley told members of the American
Public Health Association. ``He abandoned that fundamental
Democratic principle of basic health care for all.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he added, ``The lesson Al Gore learned from the health
care defeat was that big, bold things can't get done in Washington,
so let's look to the small, symbolic things.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, Gore issued a statement accusing Bradley of
offering a ``flawed trillion dollar plan that will cost the
American people even more in the long run.'' Gore renewed his
challenge to debate Bradley, ending with, ``How about it, Bill?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign found fresh ammunition to attack Bradley's
proposal to cover uninsured Americans by subsidizing their premiums
in the private network of insurers covering federal workers.
</P>
<P>
   Emory public health specialist Ken Thorpe, who two weeks ago
estimated that Bradley's proposal would cost $1.2 trillion over 10
years, on Monday downgraded his estimate to $1.06 trillion, taking
into account offsets suggested by the Bradley campaign. He
estimated Bradley's plan would cost $78.9 billion in the first
year, as compared to Bradley's own estimate of $55-$65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He said Bradley's plan underestimated the cost of health care
inflation and underestimated by $15 billion the cost of his
proposed prescription drug benefit, a far more generous plan that
what Gore has proposed. Altogether, Thorpe estimated Bradley's plan
would provide health insurance to 15 million new uninsured and
cover 89 percent of Americans. Gore's plan, at an estimated cost of
$312 billion over 10 years, would insure 12.1 new Americans and
cover 88 percent of the population, Thorpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed enrolling children whose family incomes are
less than 250 percent of the poverty threshold in the federally
subsidized Medicaid program. Gore's program would be open only to
those who have no health insurance now.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's plan would be available to anyone whose family incomes
were 300 percent of the federal poverty level, including those who
wanted to drop coverage through an employer and enroll in the
federal employee plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senator Bradley's plan ... imperils Medicare, wipes out
Medicaid, spends billions on those who already have health
insurance, only covers 1 percent more than my plan _ far from his
stated goal of 95 percent _ and does so while using up our entire
surplus,'' Gore said. Bradley's campaign said Thorpe was biased
because he was a health care adviser to the Clinton-Gore
administration from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken Thorpe has never been the authority on health care,'' said
Kristan Ludecke, Bradley's spokeswoman.

 &HT;    Cyclone devastation turns India into 'hell'
 &HT;    By Moni Basu
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BHUBANESWAR, India _ It is Diwali, the Hindu Festival of Lights,
but the state of Orissa's capital city, like many of the nearby
towns and villages, is in darkness.
</P>
<P>
   India's largest religious festival is normally celebrated with
lights and fireworks, but this year northern Orissa is silent.
Millions are homeless and thousands are dead after one of the
mightiest storms in India's history ravaged this state's populous
and poor eastern coastline Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   The ``super cyclone'' with 165 mph winds blew inland, causing
destruction unprecedented in living memory. Fifteen million people
were directly in the storm's path.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven days later, most of Bhubaneswar is still without
electricity. It could be a month before normal power is restored.
After the sun goes down at 5:30, it is impossible to negotiate
streets without a flashlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we celebrate Diwali, tell me? We can't,'' said Gayatri
Das, a schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   From the airplane, it is obvious that something terrible
happened here. Orissa, one of India's greenest states, wears the
color of straw. Its lush coconut and betel palms and its grand
banyans are stripped of their leaves like shorn sheep. From the
taxi, the naked, warped arms of trees can be seen jutting out every
which way amid the rueful remains of human habitation.
</P>
<P>
   There are huts halved by enormous branches while fallen palms
serve as bridges over stagnant pools of flood water.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty coastal villages have vanished, the government said, and
773,000 acres of rice fields were washed out. The government's
official count so far lists 3,417 people dead _ victims who have
been properly identified. But no one really knows for sure how many
lives have been lost. Figures of 10,000 and more are suspected by
relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   In Salia Sahi, a slum just outside Bhubaneswar, rows on rows of
thatched roof huts lie flat as pancakes. The poorest of the poor
survived the storm by fleeing their homes and seeking refuge in an
unfinished multistory apartment house half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is Diwali, but there is no happiness in my heart,'' said
Manoj Das, a day laborer. ``It was 2 in the morning when everything
crashed. The wind was howling. I have never seen anything like it
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Das pointed to his two daughters sleeping under a makeshift
palm-frond gazebo. ``I feel lucky I survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Many did not.
</P>
<P>
   Ulla Reddy was buried alive by the stone and clay of his own
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the poorest of the poor, and now they have nothing.
Nothing at all,'' said Rashmi Mohanty, a field worker for CARE, the
international relief agency. Late last week, CARE's U.S.
headquarters in Atlanta announced it needs to raise $5 million to
respond to the devastation in India.
</P>
<P>
   Other agencies are also trying to help but the needs are clearly
staggering. The state of Orissa said $581 million was needed.
</P>
<P>
   The northern highway out of Bhubaneswar is dotted with trucks
and four-wheel-drive vehicles carrying relief supplies to cyclone
victims. Swarms of starving men, women and children mob vehicles
that stop to divide up rations. Some people rush out from destroyed
homes; others are already on the road, living in ramshackle tents
made from bamboo and plastic bags. They cling to the trucks like
bees on a hive.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks, they say, may truly be their only chance of
survival.
</P>
<P>
   In Kalagarh, a mob rushes toward a taxi, mistaking it for a
relief vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Babadharan Jena said his village lost 50 to 60 cattle, some of
their carcasses still rotting in watering holes around Kalagrah.
Jena, a factory worker, started rebuilding his brick and mud hut
this week.
</P>
<P>
   His next-door neighbor, Gourang Jena, recalled how villagers
rode out the storm in a hut whose roof caved in. ``I was lucky I
managed to get out of my house with my wife and children before a
tree fell on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing in abundance in the vicinity is wood _ plenty of
it from felled trees. Along the highway, men and boys work all day
chopping whatever they are able to carry away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use this as firewood for cooking and also to rebuild
our homes,'' said Rajendra Bari.
</P>
<P>
   At the main food distribution center in Kendrapara, dust, heat
and confusion abound.
</P>
<P>
   The dirt parking lot is crammed with 50 trucks loaded with bags
of rice, lentils, powdered milk, vegetable oil, plastic bags,
candles, matchboxes and medical supplies. By late afternoon, they
will be dispatched to nine neighboring districts. Relief workers
are also racing against the spread of diarrheal disease. Snake
venom has been rushed in, too, as flooding drove poisonous snakes
from their holes.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief discussion with veterinary experts on the disposal
of animal carcasses, Basant Swain, the government official in
charge of the Kendrapara relief operation, turns his attention to
the human toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there is no difference between rich and poor,'' Swain
said. ``I heard that the entire village of Kanpur has gone into the
sea. I haven't been there yet, but that's what I heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Swain's office organizes the relief effort in tandem with the
Indian army. There is no electricity in any of the state offices.
Many offices don't have working phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are cut off from everyone,'' said G.C. Lenka, inspector
general of police for the Kendrapara area. ``Television is a dream
for us. We are working here without knowing what is happening in
the outside world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orissa government has allotted 500 grams or a little over a
pound of food per adult for three days and 250 grams each for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aid is reaching the people, but it's way too little,'' said
Aniruddha Mukherji, a freelance film maker and photojournalist
retained by CARE to document the crisis. ``Many of these people are
stretching the food they get for more than three days. Five hundred
grams per person for three days is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the road to the port city of Paradwip, not a single tree
still stands. The air is still thick with death.
</P>
<P>
   This is the port town where the cyclone made its landfall.
Corpses litter the roadsides and charred remains of freshly
cremated bodies mar the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw people flying in the air in front of me,'' said B.K.
Samal, a member of the Paradwip Port security force. ``I saw 10
people blown away. We didn't even find their corpses. The wind _ it
was so strong we couldn't see anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as the death toll continues to rise, the living confront
uncertain futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have lost all sources of livelihood,'' said CARE's
Mohanty. ``All their income sources are ruined, all their homes
ruined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a hell,'' the relief worker added, ``this is it.''
</P>
<P>
   How you can help
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the temperature soared to 75 degrees in Indianapolis,
breaking a record that had stood for 120 years. Tuesday, gusty
breezes from the southwest will direct the unseasonable warmth
eastward, setting the stage for additional records from the Ohio
Valley to the Middle Atlantic Coast. Some of the warmest air will
occur across the Middle Atlantic coastal plain as the air mass is
further heated by compression upon descending the Appalachian
mountains. Amid abundant sunshine, daytime readings will climb well
into the 70s from Raleigh, N.C., to Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly air will persist across northern New England. Clouds and
spotty light rain or snow showers will form over extreme northern
Maine as a warm front approaches from the southwest. Cooler air
will also arrive across the Northern Plains and upper Mississippi
Valley behind a weak cool front pressing south through the region.
</P>
<P>
   Ample sun and warm conditions will cover an expansive area from
Texas and the southern Plains to the Southeast States. Patches of
cumulus clouds will obscure the sun at times near the southern
Appalachians as the uneven heating of the undulating terrain
encourages ascending currents of moist air.
</P>
<P>
   Windswept rain will buffet the Northwest Coast on Tuesday as
moist Pacific air is lifted by an approaching cold front. Snow will
fall in the Cascades with snow levels lowering to pass level this
evening. California and the remainder of the Southwest will be
mostly sunny and seasonable, though low clouds will cling to
portions of the Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Duluth's Dearth
</P>
<P>
   Duluth, Minn., at the west end of Lake Superior is known for its
long, cold winters. In fact, much of the downtown is connected by
tunnels and enclosed elevated walkways so residents do not need
bundle up to go across the street in the winter. On Monday, the
mercury rose to a record high of 67 degrees, far above the normal
maximum of 40. Duluth has yet to measure its first snowfall of the
season. In a typical year, the first inch would fall by this
weekend. In 1964, the city had no measurable snow until November
24, the latest ever. The warm spell should end on Wednesday, but no
snow is in sight.

a t NTA--Fromvesselstovalves doctorsareengineeringrep   11-08 0790
</HEADER>
<BODY>
NTA -- From vessels to valves, doctors are engineering replacement
parts for ailing hearts as well as improving arteries for bypass
surgery. And now -- for the first time -- a complete heart valve
has been grown in the lab using cells from blood vessel walls in
sheep, researchers reported Sunday at the American Heart
Association meeting here.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The sheep cells were seeded into a biodegradable, synthetic
form, or scaffold. As they grew, they were subjected to increasing
flows and pressures to mimic the blood flow patterns in the heart,
which made the growing valve stronger. After 14 days, the cells had
grown into the desired shape -- including flaplike structures that
allow the blood to flow in only one direction.
</P>
<P>
   The valves were surgically implanted into the sheep, where they
worked well for more than five months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are interested in figuring out how to grow human
valves from a patient's own tissue because the current options are
so limited. The pig valves now used in humans stiffen and stop
working after a time. Patients with mechanical valves have to take
blood-thinning drugs to prevent blood clots. A patient's body
wouldn't reject a valve made from his or her own cells.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in sheep-valve research, said Dr. Simon Hoerstrup
of Harvard Medical School, is to expand the experiment into a
larger number of animals for a longer time.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers across the country, including doctors at St. Luke's
Episcopal Hospital and Methodist Hospital in Houston, are exploring
ways to increase blood flow by helping the heart grow its own new
blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis. The treatment would
stimulate the growth of a mesh of capillaries that could carry
blood to parts of the heart usually nourished by coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   The substance to promote that process, which could be delivered
through direct injection or minimally invasive surgery, might
someday help patients who have poor blood flow to the heart despite
bypass operations or angioplasty, in which a balloon-tipped
catheter widens a narrowed blood vessel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angiogenesis therapy is making progress,'' said Dr. James
Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart Institute at St.
Luke's, during one of the meeting's main sessions. ``We're not
there yet, but we'll get there.''
</P>
<P>
   In three studies discussed Sunday, the vessel-promoting protein
called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) appeared to be
safe for humans. In the largest of these trials, which included
Houston as a test site, volunteers with chest pain who were not
candidates for heart surgery received five intravenous infusions of
VEGF. Patient improvement was measured by exercise treadmill time,
decrease in chest pain and other quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   After two months, patients felt better and lasted longer on the
treadmill. But initial results indicated a strong placebo effect --
similarities between the patients getting VEGF and those who
believed they were getting VEGF but actually got an inert
substance. So the question remains, does it work?
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there was an improvement, in exercise time,'' said
Minnesota cardiologist Timothy Henry, who presented the study.
``It's an emerging field. It's brand new. We're still finding out
what the best time points are.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry said two months is too early to draw conclusions; the peak
response time probably comes later than that.
</P>
<P>
   Another strategy reported Sunday looked at reconditioning a
patient's own veins with a DNA ``bath'' to improve the success rate
of leg bypass operations.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Mann, a surgical resident at Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston, said that up to 50 percent of all leg bypass
surgeries fail 5 to 10 years after the operation because the
vessels used to bypass the clogged arteries thicken and become
blocked themselves. Graft blockages are treated with another
operation or angioplasty.
</P>
<P>
   In the experimental procedure, the vein to be grafted was bathed
in a fluid containing small pieces of artificial DNA before
surgeons implanted it in the patient. The DNA ``turned off'' the
genes responsible for the growth of an abnormal layer in the wall
of the engrafted vein, which eventually leads to blockage.
</P>
<P>
   In the year following their bypass surgery, the patients who
received gene therapy had fewer than half of the reblockages of the
patients who received surgery alone.
</P>
<P>
   Although the study was small, the results were statistically
significant, Mann said, showing promise for a treatment that is
fast and relatively cheap. ``This procedure could end up having a
major impact,'' Mann said, ``not only on long term success of all
types of bypass surgery, but also on the cost of treating graft
blockages.''

`MUSEUM OF UNCONDITIONAL SURRENDER': TREATING EXILE AS A SEPARATE
COUNTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) 
(DW) 
 By RICHARD EDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Exile is the only country without a geography. It has, however,
a climate, a culture, an ecology, an archaeology and virtually a
national smell. They figure on the doleful map drawn by Dubravka
Ugresic, a refugee from the repressive nationalist politics and
culture of post-Yugoslav Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   It shows us:
</P>
<P>
   ``That exile is the history of the things we leave behind, of
buying and abandoning hair driers, cheap little radios, coffee
pots. . . . That exile is changing voltages and kilohertz, life
with an adapter, so we don't burn ourselves. That exile is the
history of our temporary rented apartments, the first lonely
mornings as we spread out the map of the town in silence, find on
the map the name of our street and mark it with a cross in pencil.
(We repeat the history of the great conquerors, with little crosses
instead of flags.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Those little firm facts, stamps in our passport, accumulate
and at a certain moment they become illegible lines. Then they
suddenly begin to trace an inner map, the map of the unreal, the
imaginary. And it is only then that they express precisely the
immeasurable experience of exile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Museum of Unconditional Surrender'' is a strew of such
factlets, a Hansel-and-Gretel trail of crumbs into the witch's
forest of our time. Seemingly disjointed and sometimes forced, they
assemble a universal _ the human displacements of Bosnia, Kosovo,
Rwanda, East Timor, Chechnya _ in strikingly individual terms.
Ugresic's stream-of-consciousness exile in Berlin gives us not the
gory amputation of refugee flight but arrival's grayer course of
tissue-rejection.
</P>
<P>
   The author, who has spent years of expatriation in Germany and
the United States and now lives in the Netherlands, is a novelist
and essayist. Her style is personal and aphoristic. ``Museum,''
originally in Croatian, is a mix of diary, notebook, commonplace
book and memoir; its facts and conversations slide between record
and invention. There is much that is arbitrary and self-indulgent,
yet ``Museum'' is a precious portrait of exile as internal
displacement.
</P>
<P>
   Ugresic knows she writes in the line of greater and more
spacious chroniclers of the theme. She freely quotes Nabokov and
Joseph Brodsky; her spitfire artistic assertiveness has a curious
humility to it. Nevertheless, she must be numbered among what
Jacques Maritain called the dreamers of what is true; she draws us
into the dream.
</P>
<P>
   Scattershot and posturing as she can be, there is a startling
aim in her master image at the beginning. A display case in the
Berlin Zoo holds the contents of the stomach of Roland the Walrus,
who died in 1961: a pink cigarette lighter, a water pistol,
sunglasses, a toy parachute, a small doll, a beer can, a poodle
brooch, a sewing kit, car keys and much else.
</P>
<P>
   I Am the Walrus is the leitmotiv of Ugresic's narrator/alter
ego, Bubi. Exiled out of a polar remove, Bubi lives not in a zoo
but an equivalent: the museum of the title. Exile reality, no
longer nourished by roots, is a collection of orphan sensations,
artifacts and memories. One of the most persuasive themes in the
Berlin jottings around which the book is constructed _ other parts
include childhood memories, the story of her mother and an account
of the breakup of Yugoslavia and a band of college friends along
with it _ is photographs.
</P>
<P>
   There are two kinds of refugees, a Bosnian friend remarks,
``those who have photographs and those who have none.'' The
narrator tells an anecdote about the Bosnian-Serb general and war
criminal Ratko Mladic. Noticing that the Sarajevo house of an
acquaintance was on his bombardment list, Mladic phoned to inform
him he had five minutes to collect his photograph albums and leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general, who had been destroying the city for months, knew
precisely how to annihilate memory. That is why he `generously'
bestowed on his acquaintance life with the right to remembrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Remembrance is possession, but it rusts. The narrator haunts the
Berlin flea market where Europe's displaced _ Ukrainians, Bosnians,
Africans, Gypsies, Turks and her own countrymen _ peddle a tumulus
of memory as objects. A shadow passes over the reader. How special
a case can exile be? Just across the tracks from the global village
the global flea market is setting up.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator promenades a series of tags to test out her
particular estrangement. ``Ich bin muede'' (``I am tired''): her
first German phrase, and for a while she wants to learn no other.
``Learning more means opening up.'' Later comes ``Guten Tag,''
exchanged with Herr Schroeder, the postman. Apparently a greeting,
to the exile it warns: come no farther.
</P>
<P>
   Herr Schroeder draws arrows on the envelopes to remind her to
give him the Croatian stamps. ``Berlin loneliness is as acute and
unambiguous as Herr Schroeder's arrow,'' she notes, and she's off
to test ``I'm lonely'' among her exile friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising,'' says Zoran. ``Everyone in Berlin is
lonely. And for some reason, no one ever has any time.'' Again
she's off, asking a dozen people: ``Have you some time?'' They
ignore the question. Only the exile ``has'' time; the settled,
lonely or not, ``use'' it.
</P>
<P>
   Interspersed with the Berlin wanderings are vignettes from the
past. There is a tender account of the narrator's mother, from her
girlhood in Bulgaria to the gradually easing rigors of postwar
Yugoslavia to the bleakness, for an old Yugoslav believer, of
seeing the country fall apart. There is a soured love affair, a
cheerful passage with a Portuguese gigolo, a zany feud with three
Indian students in a London rooming house.
</P>
<P>
   The writing here can be overmannered. So is the story of eight
Croatian, Serbian and Bosnian women whose friendship ruptures when
the civil war begins. The many jagged and poignant details are
dimmed by fictional and symbolic inflation, including a magic
realist angel.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Berlin notes that give ``Museum'' its sharp and
haunting edge. There are times, of course, when a reader may wonder
about the treatment of exile as a depressive finality. After all,
untold millions have found a life beyond it. For a moment, though,
italicize that ``have.'' Like entrails for the ancient Greeks, the
inspired particularities of ``Museum'' have a suggestion of
prophecy. The story of illness is not subsumed by the story of
cures. In our day is exile still an illness or the beginnings of
pandemic?

 &HT;    CLINTON AND GOP DISAGREE OVER CLASS-SIZE REDUCTION
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 CoxNews Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Republican leaders in
Congress said Monday that the biggest obstacle to finishing this
fiscal year's budget is their disagreement over the president's
class-size reduction plan.
</P>
<P>
   Their other differences _ mostly over spending levels for dozens
of small programs _ were melting away hour by hour in quiet
compromises, as staff members from both sides phoned and faxed
offers and counter-offers back and forth between the White House
and Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., both
said they expect to reach all the necessary compromises without any
threat of a government shutdown. At separate news conferences, both
men said it is possible the budget bickering will end before the
Thursday Veterans Day holiday, but said that, if necessary, they
would continue to bargain next week.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man mentioned that, after agreeing to raise education
spending by 12 percent last year, Republicans and Democrats have
reached a tacit agreement to raise it this year by less than 4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they emphasized the profound differences between their
parties on what kind of strings to attach to one federal education
program _ class-size reduction, which cost $1.2 billion last year
and would cost $1.4 billion this year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton demanded continuation of the policy of requiring that
districts use the money to recruit, hire and train teachers or meet
other costs of reducing the average class size to 18 in the first
through third grades. He vetoed a bill in which Republicans tried
to give every school district the option of using its share of this
year's $1.4 billion for any educational purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of keeping their commitment to hire more teachers and
reduce class size _ again, I say, something they bragged on and ran
on last year _ now they want an open-ended block grant which could
even be used for vouchers for private schools,'' Clinton said. ``I
think that is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue is, who controls it?'' Lott said. ``Will
Washington bureaucrats assert and control where this money is used,
or will there be some discretion at the local level, based on what
local needs are _ whether it's books or computers or training for
teachers, or for teachers themselves?''
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't even agree on what has been done with the first
$1.2 billion, which was sent to the school districts this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that preliminary data from the Department of
Education shows that districts used much of their money to recruit,
hire and train 29,000 teachers, with the result that 1.7 million
children in the early grades will be educated in smaller classes
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said districts have spent only $67 million of the $1.2
billion, which shows ``you're talking about a large sum of money
that has not resulted in producing a large number of additional
teachers as of yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited independent studies containing ``mountain upon
mountain of evidence that smaller classes in the early grades lead
to permanent learning gains if the teachers are well qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said, ``Do you know what the local needs are in Liberty,
Miss.? I don't, but I'll bet you the teachers and administrators
and the parents there know whether they do need more teachers or
they need some more books or computers or other needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men said they expect their differences on the class-size
program to be worked out.

MUSEUM TO DISPLAY NEW YORK TIMES CAPSULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This year, editors of The New York Times Magazine
invited 48 designers, architects and engineers to submit proposals
for The New York Times Capsule, a vessel to preserve artifacts from
this century for the next 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   The winning design is to be announced on Dec. 4, and it will be
displayed, along with a sampling of the items considered essential
for understanding the 20th century, beginning that day at the
American Museum of Natural History.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, ``Capturing Time: The New York Times Capsule,''
on view through March 26, will explore concepts like biological
time, time and the universe, and time and civilization. The
proposals of the 10 finalists will be displayed, as well as
time-related artifacts culled from the museum's collection.
Computer stations will allow visitors to log onto the Times Web
site to observe and add to readers' suggestions for the capsule's
contents.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition coincides with the publication of the magazine's
sixth and final millennium issue. The capsule and many of the items
inside will be featured in that issue.
</P>
<P>
   The capsule, to be permanently displayed as the centerpiece of
the museum's new plaza on Columbus Avenue, will be sealed at the
close of the exhibition. It is to be reopened in 3000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The museum's vast collection represents a history of life on
Earth,'' said Ellen Futter, president of the museum. ``The Times
Capsule offers a snapshot of civilization today intended to last
1,000 years. It is appropriate that we assume the guardianship of
this millennial treasure, and we are honored to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition began in January when editors from the magazine
convened a panel of experts in preservation, geology, archival
materials and ``deep-time messaging,'' efforts at communication
across the centuries. Forty designers were approached; an
additional eight volunteered to participate. Competitors were asked
not to limit their designs to practical works but to be as
imaginative as possible.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time a Web site was set up to generate ideas about
the capsule's contents. Ideas were also solicited from residents of
the United States, Russia, India, France, Zimbabwe and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In addition the capsule will include all six of the magazine's
millennium issues printed on acid-free archival paper and a
microengraved nickel disc that includes one minute of ``New York
sounds'' recorded at 9:09 a.m. on 9/9/99, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The winning design and 10 finalists were selected by a panel of
judges drawn from The Times, including the editors of the final
millennium issue, the architecture critic Herbert Muschamp, the art
critics Michael Kimmelman and Roberta Smith, the design reporter
Julie Iovine and the magazine's design editor, Pilar Viladas.
</P>
<P>
   Editors declined to discuss the winning entry, saying only that
some of the proposals were meant to be buried in places like
Central Park or otherwise hidden for 1,000 years, while others were
meant to be thought of as so beautiful that people would want to
protect them.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists are the Antenna Group; a team from Cooper Union,
Caples Jefferson, Wes Jones, Jaron Lanier and Maya Lin, all from
the United States; Santiago Calatrava of Spain; Droog Design of the
Netherlands; Kenji Ekuan of Japan; Dagmar Richter of Germany; and
the Ocean Group, a collection of designers from Finland, Norway and
Germany who practice together in a paperless office in cyberspace.

CELEBRATING THE CAPTURE OF ANOTHER GLORIOUS SPACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOWMARKET, England _ The refined perils listed on the day's
shooting schedule were a good clue that the filmmakers lurking
about on a dewy morning in Suffolk might be James Ivory and Ismail
Merchant.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment would have to be moved with care ``due to narrow
drawbridge and moat,'' it said. Technicians should make sure their
hot lights don't get too close to ancestral paintings. It warned:
``There are a large number of deer on the grounds of the house. It
is rutting season and they can be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   The handyman to contact in an emergency? It identified him as
the Lord Tollemache.
</P>
<P>
   He turned out to be Timothy John Edward Tollemache, 59, the
fifth Baron Tollemache, member of the 19th generation of his family
to inhabit Helmingham Hall, and it was his stately 16th-century
pile in a privileged corner of East Anglia that the Merchant-Ivory
team had chosen as their latest sumptuous period drama setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is in this,'' Ivory said, walking through
high-ceilinged rooms with busts and tapestries and portraits. He
rubbed his hands together to ward off the dawn chill, but it looked
as if he was exulting in the capture of another glorious space.
``You could build sets to look like this,'' he said, ``but you'd
never get the texture or the feeling or the ambience like this.''
</P>
<P>
   This concern with authenticity and utter comfort with the
luxuries of the past has produced a signature look that filmgoers
have come to associate with Merchant-Ivory in movies like ``A Room
With a View,'' ``Howards End'' and ``The Remains of the Day.'' This
time the two filmmakers have turned their adoring lenses on the
opulent Edwardian settings of Henry James' ``Golden Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchant is the producer, Ivory the director, and the novel has
been adapted by the third member of the team, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.
The film stars Angelica Huston, Nick Nolte, Uma Thurman, Kate
Beckinsale, Jeremy Northam, James Fox and Madeleine Potter.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory makes no apologies for finding inspiration in books by
authors like James and E.M. Forster that other directors might find
dated. ``There's power in these books, the power of wonderful
stories and characters and great scenes to shoot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   These great scenes have brought Merchant-Ivory acclaim, but they
have also drawn detractors. The director Alan Parker once dismissed
their oeuvre as ``the Laura Ashley school of filmmaking,'' and the
swipe still provokes the unflappable Ivory. ``The comment will be
better remembered than any film he ever made,'' he said with
uncharacteristic venom.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has not diverted Merchant-Ivory from their
continuing quest for gorgeous surroundings. Other locations for
``The Golden Bowl'' include the 18th-century Renaissance-style
Mansion House with an imposing Corinthian portico in London's
financial district, which is the official residence of the Lord
Mayor of London, and Syon Park, the 16th-century home of the Duke
of Northumberland, with a spectacular conservatory and 30 acres of
gardens and parks where Queen Victoria once frolicked as a young
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere is demanded by the context,'' Ivory said. ``All
this detail doesn't overwhelm, it makes the story accessible; it
adds to the pleasure of the story. A lot of people may think the
story is swamped by the atmosphere, but I can't help that. If
people look at the curtains instead of listening to the witty
dialogue, that's not my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of his sureness of touch with British scenes, people are
often surprised to find that Ivory is an American. ``The French
always refer to me as the `cineaste anglais,' and it drives me
crazy,'' he said. Even though Merchant, Ivory and Mrs. Jhabvala all
have apartments in the same building on Manhattan's East Side, the
paths that took them there involved kinds of cultural
disinheritance that may give them a particular appreciation of
James' Americans in Europe or Forster's Englishmen in India.
</P>
<P>
   Merchant, 62, is the son of a textile trader in the Bombay
bazaars and grew up in a family of nine living in two rooms. His
last name was Rehman, but he took on the surname Merchant before
beginning his studies at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Ivory, 71, a Catholic, was brought up in Klamath Falls, Ore.,
and studied architecture at the University of Oregon. He lived for
years in India, and he and Merchant share a 14-room manor house
built in 1805 in Claverack, two hours north of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Prawer, 70, was born in Cologne, Germany, of a Polish
father and German mother. Her family fled Germany in 1939 for
England, where she was educated. She met her husband, Cyrus
Jhabvala, an Indian architect, at London University and spent 24
years in New Delhi before moving to New York in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The collaboration began in 1961, when the two filmmakers bought
the rights to her novel ``The Householder'' and persuaded her to
turn it into a screenplay. Then came their attention-getting
``Shakespeare Wallah,'' the story of British theatrical troupers in
India, and the partnership was fully cemented.
</P>
<P>
   The family spirit of the venture these days carries down through
the ranks. Strike up conversations with people on a Merchant-Ivory
set and they'll tell you the year they joined the company and the
films they have worked on, the way alumni recall their graduation
class and the honors they earned.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a team with individual appeal. Jeremy Northam said he
was drawn to ``The Golden Bowl'' by Mrs. Jhabvala's script. Uma
Thurman cited her enthusiasm for John Bright, the film's costume
designer, who has worked on 11 Merchant-Ivory films and won Academy
Awards for ``A Room With a View'' and ``Howards End.'' James Fox
mentioned the cinematographer Tony Pierce-Roberts, who has shot
eight Merchant-Ivory films, including ``Howards End,'' ``A Room
With a View'' and ``The Remains of the Day.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The car delivering Merchant and Ivory to the set swung into the
driveway of Helmingham Hall and threaded its way through the
trailer park of vans and tents covering the grounds. ``It sure
didn't look like this on our first films,'' Merchant said. Their
success and the advent of so much new technology have combined to
turn a Merchant-Ivory landing into a full invasion force, though
one with impeccable manners.
</P>
<P>
   This particular day the set had taken on a real-time aspect of a
weekend in the country. Fox, who played a retired colonel in ``The
Golden Bowl,'' bantered with Lady and Lord Tollemache; it developed
that he had served 40 years ago with Lord Tollemache in the
Coldstream Guards.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Snowden, on assignment for ``Vanity Fair,'' wandered the
lawns in hacking jacket and woolen tie and kept asking if an
underdressed visitor wasn't ``freezing to death'' from the autumn
gusts. The winds famously arrive in East Anglia, unimpeded by a
single hill, from Ukraine, the Urals or Siberia, depending on which
local you ask. Moments later, an assistant hurried across the field
with an overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   The Helmingham Hall grounds include an oak that was painted by
John Constable and three newer ones planted by Queen Elizabeth,
Prince Philip and Princess Margaret. Told that his former wife's
tree was not doing as well as the others, Lord Snowden had a
chivalrous response. ``It must have been planted more recently,
don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   Merchant-Ivory sets are renowned for being free of
scenery-chewing actors, producer blowups or cape-swinging
directorial tantrums. Merchant is a constant visitor to his sets,
but he is more likely to be busy fetching tea for a member of the
company or making one of his celebrated curries for the cast than
pitching a fit about cost overruns or schedule mix-ups.
</P>
<P>
   He is so unfailingly courteous and ingratiating that the actor
Simon Callow once said the phrase ``to curry favor'' was invented
for him. But behind the scenes his persuasiveness has more to do
with being impulsive, scheming and persistent. ``It's the only
thing we get into arguments about,'' Ivory said. ``He's a natural
showman, a great publicist, and he's just very, very good at
getting his way. He's made some casting decisions by just going
ahead and offering jobs to people on the spot. He shouldn't do it,
but then when it's people like James Mason and Maggie Smith, how
can I complain ?''
</P>
<P>
   Uma Thurman sat sipping coffee in the mess tent with extras in
their bustles and feathered bonnets and young men in snug tweeds,
high collars and wide-knotted cravats. She looked out at the
graceful sweep of Helmingham's grounds and the turreted mansion
beyond and said, ``You'd think this was a movie with three times
the budget that he has. I think of Ismail as this person who keeps
pulling rabbits out of hats.''
</P>
<P>
   He has stolen props and bailed actors out of jail in foreign
lands, but perhaps his most famous stunt was getting around a ban
on filming inside the Trianon Palace Hotel in Versailles by draping
himself in robes and posing as the Maharajah of Jodhpur. His crew
for ``The Proprietor'' masqueraded themselves as his entourage and,
once inside, set up the shoot.
</P>
<P>
   They have been at this awhile _ ``The Golden Bowl'' is the 43rd
Merchant-Ivory collaboration _ and they impart a sense of knowing
what they are doing that actors say they appreciate. ``Being asked
to act in one of their films is a nice invitation,'' Fox said.
``The set is very disciplined, and they interpret the material with
such intelligence, which isn't a luxury actors enjoy much today.''
</P>
<P>
   Their partnership, nearing its fifth decade, goes forward on an
instinctive division of labor and an ability to turn potentially
debilitating irritations into moments for grudging admiration. So
what's the latest point of friction, Ivory was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got this crazy scheme now to have a golden bowl made and
get it sold at Tiffany's,'' the director said while Merchant sat
grinning naughtily by his side. ``It's a horrible idea, but he's
not going to be stopped. And I know I'll be the first one to go and
admire it in the window if it ever happens.''

JEB BUSH TAKES SHOT AT GORE, AS GEORGE W. LOOKS ON
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Florida Gov. Jeb Bush introduced his older
brother, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, at an event here Monday with
a pointed dig at Vice President Al Gore, saying that his brother
would be a great president because ``he doesn't have to go get a
consultant to tell him how to dress.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida governor was alluding none too obliquely to reports
last week that Gore, the leading candidate for the Democratic
presidential nomination, had been paying the writer Naomi Wolf
$15,000 a month for sartorial counsel, among other bits of advice.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush was also illustrating the way in which his
brother, Gore or people affiliated with their campaigns are already
sniping at each other as if Bush and Gore were general election
opponents. The first state primary is still two and a half months
away.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a spokesman for Gore had a quote at the ready to
ridicule Bush, the front-runner for the Republican presidential
nomination, after he failed to answer three out of four questions
about foreign leaders during a television interview. And Gore took
public issue with some of the comments Bush had made in the
interview about recent political turmoil in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, it was the Bush camp's turn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call last week from Naomi Wolf,'' Jeb Bush told
several hundred people at a $1,000-a-plate fund raiser at a
downtown hotel. Then, gesturing to his beige suit, pale blue shirt
and yellow power tie, he added, ``Alpha man, don't you think?''
</P>
<P>
   The reports about Ms. Wolf contended that she had been coaching
Gore not only on his wardrobe but also on transmitting the image of
a dominant alpha male and not a subservient beta male, the role a
vice president is almost invariably assigned. Ms. Wolf later said
that this was a gross simplification and mischaracterization of her
work with the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush nonetheless reveled in the topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Running for president's got to be one of the wackier things in
the world _ where you pay someone $15,000 to teach someone how to
dress after they're 50 years old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why my brother is going to be a great president and a
great candidate,'' Bush continued. ``He doesn't have to go get a
consultant to tell him how to dress _ although he's got his mom,
and that may work better. He doesn't have to read polls to know his
heart. He doesn't have to do all the things that you apparently
have to do in post-modern American life to run for president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has repeatedly said that his campaign would be a
positive one devoid of personal attacks. But although he was not
the one mocking Gore on Monday, he did respond to a reporter's
question on the topic at a subsequent campaign stop.
</P>
<P>
   And asked if his younger brother was indeed an alpha male, Bush
said, ``I'll have to ask my consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether his performance on the pop quiz about foreign
leaders last week had potentially hurt his candidacy, Bush
expressed certitude that it had not. He noted that an array of
people _ including, to some extent, President Clinton _ had
defended his inability to answer such questions.
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly referring to his honesty about what he does and does
not know, Bush added, ``I think a lot of Americans are saying, `You
know something? I kind of respect old George W. I appreciate the
way he handled it.'''

COURT UPHOLDS MANSLAUGHTER CONVICTION AGAINST EAST GERMANY'S LAST
LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds., see related GERMANY-WALL) 
(HLW) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ An appeals court upheld a manslaughter conviction on
Monday against the last communist leader of East Germany for his
role in the shootings of people who were trying to escape to the
West.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict from the court in Leipzig, the highest appeals court
in Germany, appears to make it almost inevitable that the leader,
Egon Krenz, who ultimately opened the Berlin Wall 10 years ago,
would go to jail after legal formalities have been completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will wear my prison uniform with more honor than certain
judges wear their robes,'' Krenz, 62, said after the verdict had
been read out to spectators' derisive cheers.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz's lawyers said that they would appeal the sentence in the
European Court of Human Rights, in Strasbourg, France, a process
that is certain to be protracted.
</P>
<P>
   Occurring on the eve of celebrations on the anniversary of the
fall of the wall, the decision showed the many ways in which
Germany's past continues to weigh heavily. But most Germans
apparently now feel that the quests for justice over the actions of
the East German police state are close to exhausting themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz's lawyers have argued that the acts of another state, East
Germany, cannot be judged by German courts today and that Krenz is
the object of persecution that reflects the West's triumph in the
Cold War. The lawyers have also said that the border policy could
not be changed because East Germany was under the sway of the
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   At least 450 people were killed as they tried to escape after
the wall went up in 1961 and other areas of the border with West
Germany were heavily fortified. The killings have been the object
of intermittent, often inconclusive, legal actions.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on Monday concerned an appeal against a
six-and-a-half-year sentence against Krenz handed down in 1997.
Krenz, who ruled for six weeks before the wall fell, served two
weeks of the sentence before being released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals of two other leading members of the Politburo,
Guenther Kleiber and Guenther Schabowski, were also rejected. They
face lesser sentences of three years each.
</P>
<P>
   Krenz's predecessor, Erich Honecker, went to jail briefly in
1993. He was released because of poor health and died in 1994 in
exile in Chile. Hundreds of border guards and other officials have
been indicted. But fewer than 20 prison sentences have been handed
down.
</P>
<P>
   A principal difficulty in the trials has been whether guards
could be held accountable for obeying orders. At a higher level,
the tracing of orders from specific individuals has often proved
arduous.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of continuing divisions here, the Party of
Democratic Socialism, successor to the East German Communists, said
in a statement that the verdict was ``a continuation of the Cold
War in a new form.'' Such arguments have won the party a wide
following in the east.

FLORIDA GOVERNOR TAKES SHOT AT `ALPHA' GORE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. _ Gov. Jeb Bush took on Democratic
front-runner Al Gore on his brother's behalf Monday, portraying the
vice president as shallow and insincere for hiring feminist Naomi
Wolf as his personal consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call from Naomi Wolf _ Alpha male, don't you think?''
Jeb Bush said, modeling his khaki suit, blue shirt and yellow tie.
``Running for president has got to be one of the wackier things in
the world, where you pay 15 grand to teach someone how to dress
after they are 50 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been under criticism lately following a revelation that
his campaign was paying Wolf $15,000 a month as a consultant. Wolf,
whose writings espouse controversial ideas about sex education,
advised Gore to wear ``warmer'' clothing and act more like an
``Alpha'' male.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush went on to tell a fund-raising luncheon for Texas Gov.
George W. Bush's presidential campaign that the Naomi Wolf incident
showed a sharp contrast between his brother and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, that's why my brother's going to be a great
president, why he's a great candidate, because he does not believe
in that nonsense,'' Jeb Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to go get a consultant to tell him how to
dress. Or maybe he's got his mom. ... He doesn't have to read polls
to know what's in his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   When George W. Bush was asked later whether Jeb was an ``alpha''
male, George responded: ``I haven't asked my consultant.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the Gore campaign. But Wolf
said on weekend talk shows that she advised him on women's issues,
from the wage gap that women face to making a better balance
between work and family. Her pay recently was reduced to $5,000 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new Florida poll shows Bush leading Gore in the
Sunshine State 49 percent to 39 percent. But Bush's lead narrows to
45 percent to 37 percent with Bill Bradley as the Democratic
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times poll found Bush with a
commanding 59 percent support in the GOP primary. Sen. John McCain
of Arizona was the only other Republican in double-digits, with 14
percent. Gore led Bradley 54 percent to 32 percent among Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has complained about sharp campaign jabs as
``Washington-style politics,'' allowed his brother's shots to serve
as a reply to Gore's criticism of Bush last week for failing a
reporter's pop quiz on foreign leaders' names.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bush's inability to answer showed he was unprepared to
be president. Bush also has become the subject of late-night
television jokes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush shrugged them off at a Monday news conference after touring
the Duval County jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``The voters know I will have a strong foreign policy,'' Bush
said, noting he has promoted rebuilding the military, deploying
anti-ballistic missiles and renewing alliances. ``So I'm confident
people are hearing what I am talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he also believes the pop quiz may have a positive
effect on his campaign, especially since several foreign policy
leaders and President Bill Clinton came to his defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel cheap-shotted at all,'' Bush said. ``The fallout
was very positive, I thought. A lot of people, including the
president of the United States, came to my defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Americans are saying, `I kind of respect George W. I
appreciate the way he handled it,'`` the Texas governor added.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned Monday about the results of Mexico's primary
elections Sunday, Bush gave a far more detailed answer than he gave
the Boston reporter last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Ernesto Zedillo told me a year ago he was going to
open up the (Institutional Revolutionary Party) PRI primary. I told
him I thought it was going to be one of the most interesting
reforms in Mexican political history. I haven't seen the final
results, but the fact that the PRI primary was open is a big step.
</P>
<P>
   ``I met (primary winner Francisco) Labastida when I was down
there, when I was in Mexico. He was in the Cabinet, the president's
Cabinet. I went to the Cinco de Mayo celebration with he and some
of the other Cabinet officials. He seemed like a really decent guy.
To me it's a very positive sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, President Zedillo, to his credit has done what
he said he was going to do. It's unusual for a president to make a
big reform decision like that after years and years of the
president getting to pick who the candidate is.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, Bush's campaign issued a statement calling for full
funding of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which uses oil and
gas drilling revenues to help local communities build and improve
parks and recreational areas. Since 1996, the statement said,
federal funding has stopped.

<P>
   DENVER _ A national shortage of school bus drivers, caused by
the roaring economy and a rise in the school-age population, is
making students wait up to an hour for a ride, delaying and
canceling field trips and athletic events, and forcing mechanics,
transportation supervisors and even some teachers to get behind the
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   School districts and private bus companies are responding to the
shortage with ambitious recruiting initiatives, offering $1,000
signing bonuses, higher wages, longer hours, child care and other
benefits, plus cash prizes for referrals and good attendance. They
are seeking new drivers through television and radio advertisements
as well as through job fairs and, in some areas, door-to-door
canvassing.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts, who attribute the shortage mainly to record
low unemployment levels, are worried that the pool of potential
drivers has largely disappeared as fewer people pursue part-time
work, particularly the kind that involves discipline of and
responsibility for children.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Fischer, a school bus consultant based in Peyton, put
the national shortfall at 20 percent. In recent surveys by School
Bus Fleet, a trade magazine published in Torrance, Calif., more
than 70 percent of the United States' school districts said they
were struggling to fill drivers' seats, with officials in 44 states
citing the shortage as a problem, and 17 of them calling it severe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge problem that no one seems to have an answer for
right now,'' said Michael Martin, executive director of the
National Association for Pupil Transportation, whose annual
convention here last week was dominated by discussion of the dearth
of drivers. ``It's not a problem that's getting better, it's a
problem that's getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools throughout the country have staggered starting times so
that buses can deliver elementary school pupils, loop around to
pick up middle school students and then make a third run for
high-schoolers.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes on Long Island, N.Y., and in Florida have forfeited
games because they had no way to get there. In Hartford, Conn.,
dozens of students missed breakfast at school and morning classes
in September because buses arrived as late as 10 a.m. The student
ski club in Aurora, Colo., now has to charter buses to the slopes,
and in Caledonia, Mich., field trips must fit in between 9 a.m. and
2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A bus company in New Hampshire is offering drivers college
tuition, and a company in New Jersey is posting fliers on golf
courses, suggesting that duffers drive the morning route, hit the
links, and then return for the afternoon run. Laidlaw Education
Services, the largest private contractor in the business with
35,000 buses in 35 states, has hired full-time recruiters and has
begun offering a 401(k) plan for the first time in many areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Basalt, an old mining town about 20 miles northwest of Aspen
that has become a bedroom community for service workers at nearby
resorts, a driver was doing double duty, stranding children at
school for an hour before and after classes, until Ronald Goth, a
teacher at the elementary school, agreed to take on a second job.
</P>
<P>
   Like several of his colleagues, Goth had obtained a commercial
driver's license so that he could take students on field trips
without having to hire a bus. While reluctant at first to give up
his early-morning lesson-preparation time, Goth said that picking
up and dropping off 65 students at a trailer park each day helped
broaden his understanding of his students' lives, and had padded
his income to help with expenses for his 9-month-old daughter,
Annie.
</P>
<P>
   Of Basalt's nine drivers, six are teachers, and signs posted
throughout the elementary school sound the bell for more.
</P>
<P>
   Kicking tires and checking hoses is not exactly what Goth, 32,
expected when he chose a career in education. And while he enjoys
the serenity of cruising alongside the Roaring Fork River,
surrounded by white-blanketed mountain peaks, his responsibility on
the road is, in some ways, more daunting than the challenges of the
classroom, where he teaches first- through fourth-graders in a
special program.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody has trouble reading, I can work with a child over
and over until the child gets it,'' Goth said as the children
settled into the seats behind him. ``If I injure a child with this
bus, it's something I can never get over.''
</P>
<P>
   School bus accidents routinely make headlines _ like the one
last month in Albany, N.Y., that has prompted a $10 million lawsuit
against the bus company and its 79-year-old driver, or the one last
week in Odessa, Fla., in which a 10-year-old boy was dropped at the
wrong stop, four miles from home, and than was struck by a car and
killed. But statistically, the big yellow bus is among the safest
ways to travel.
</P>
<P>
   About 24 million children ride 418,000 school buses 4.5 billion
miles a year in the United States. From 1988 to 1998, school buses
were involved in just 0.3 percent of the nation's 416,000 fatal
traffic accidents, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration says. There have been an average of 128 fatalities
per year in school bus accidents, though only 10 percent of those
victims were riding on the buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's safer to be in a yellow school bus going to school than
to walk or to have your mother drive you,'' said a spokesman for
the traffic safety agency, Tim Hurd. ``There are special mirrors
and lights and regulations that make it the safest way to get from
point A to point B.''
</P>
<P>
   But neither the federal government nor the school transportation
industry tracks nonfatal crashes or other incidents, like students
being dropped at the wrong place or abandoned in the back of the
bus. It is impossible to know whether such problems have increased
during the current shortage.
</P>
<P>
   In separate incidents in September, two 5-year-olds were left on
buses in Long Island, one of them stranded at the depot during
Hurricane Floyd. In Yonkers, N.Y., there were three cases last year
of children not being returned home at the end of the school day,
leading the district to demand that all its contractors install
child-find alarm systems in the backs of buses that alert drivers
if children are left behind.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the district has hired bus monitors for every
elementary school bus. In Stamford, Conn., parents have complained
about buses never showing up, and twice recently, drivers have been
cited for stopping on railroad tracks.
</P>
<P>
   A Westchester County, N.Y., grand jury impaneled after two fatal
accidents involving school buses in the last three years
recommended two weeks ago that a trained monitor ride every bus in
New York state and escort children off at each stop, and that
vehicles have alarms to make sure riders are not left behind.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention in Denver, several vendors were hawking
high-tech devices that survey seats for passengers before drivers
leave the bus, suggesting a growing concern.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders insisted that the driver shortage is not
causing them to cut corners on qualifications and training, but
they acknowledged that scrambling for substitutes could lead to
safety problems. If mechanics are driving, they are not available
for emergency repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Substitute drivers don't know the routes, don't know the
children, can't control the kids _ that's when a lot of accidents
happen,'' said Steve Hirano, editor of School Bus Fleet. ``It's
just like a substitute teacher in the classroom. The kids are going
to test them, they're going to see what they can get away with.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Sutherland, director of transportation for the Academy
School District in Colorado Springs, took her cellular phone along
when she drove a route recently, because she knew a driver would
need her counsel on dealing with a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone rang; I said to the kids, `I need to pull over to do
my other job,''' Ms. Sutherland recalled. ``It's a great experience
for me to be behind the wheel, but it's very difficult to be both
people at the exact same minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers in most school districts have patched together
solutions to cover the shortfall in the short term, but they are
worried about the future, especially in light of the growing
student population. (Several states are also considering
legislation that would shorten the distance from school that
requires busing, further increasing ridership.)
</P>
<P>
   The problem is particularly acute in fast-growing suburbia,
where families often have two parents working full time, increasing
the demand for busing while also shrinking the supply of drivers.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, requirements for drivers have gotten more
rigorous. Federal law now mandates drug and alcohol testing, and
most states also conduct criminal background checks and physical
exams, and require regular refresher courses. And all this for a
job that pays as little as $8 an hour (in large cities like Boston
and San Francisco, it can be $16 to $18), often for just four hours
a day, starting before most people are awake.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover is high, and many school districts complain that they
train applicants only to lose them to more lucrative jobs in
trucking once they obtain their commercial licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Page, who is president of the national pupil
transportation group and director of transportation for the schools
in Lawrence, N.Y., said a Suffolk County company this year spent
$100,000 to recruit and another $100,000 to train 92 drivers. Only
two remain on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make more money at McDonald's flipping hamburgers,''
said Fischer, the consultant, ``and you won't have any problems
disciplining kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Many districts are trying to provide longer hours _ either by
combining driving with custodial or cafeteria work, or by
guaranteeing pay even if there is no midday driving _ because they
say their traditional work force of stay-at-home mothers, college
students and retired people seems less available.
</P>
<P>
   Private companies are filling out driver schedules with charter
work. Contractors and schools alike are allowing drivers to take
their own young children on their routes, or paying for child care.
Health benefits are becoming common even for part-time workers;
some districts are offering further perks, like free legal advice.
In Houston, starting salaries rose to $11.22 an hour from $9.36 an
hour in one year.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Mann, the transportation supervisor in Lincoln, Neb.,
started the school year short 40 of 170 drivers. Students sat in
gymnasiums while drivers circled back on double and triple routes;
office staff drove every day, and then stayed until 10 p.m. to do
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every phone call I get, it's usually somebody complaining
about the service,'' said Ms. Mann, who wore a pewter school bus
pin. ``After we've said, `Your children are safe _ I'm sorry we're
late,' I say, `Would you like to drive a bus?'''

MATTHEW SHEPARD'S FATHER URGES CONGRESS TO PASS HATE-CRIMES LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Flanked by Republican lawmakers, the father of
Matthew Shepard, a college student whose beating death stemmed from
the fact that he was a homosexual, urged Congress Monday to adopt
legislation that would extend federal hate-crime protection to gays
and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call upon the president and Congress to come together, put
all differences aside and pass the Hate Crimes Prevention Act,''
said Shepard's father Dennis at a news conference in front of the
U.S. Capitol. ``We urge our nation's leaders to take every possible
action to end the violence that killed our son.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation ``will not end hatred and will not even stop
hate crimes from happening,'' Shepard added. ``But it can reduce
them by making it easier for our federal government to put
resources into the hands of people best suited to combat these
crimes _ local law enforcement agencies.'' Shepard's mother Judy
stood by her husband but did not speak.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 6, 1998, Aaron McKinney, 21, and Russell Henderson, 22,
lured Matthew Shepard, 21, out of a bar, robbed him, beat him with
a pistol and tied him to a fence on the outskirts of Laramie, Wyo.
He died five days later. Both assailants were convicted and given
double life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In July the Senate approved the legislation as part of an
appropriations bill for the Commerce, Justice and State
Departments, but the House did not. Republican leaders dropped the
measure entirely during a conference committee of House and Senate
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Current federal law permits federal prosecution of a hate crime
only if it is believed to be motivated by the victim's race, color,
religion or national origin. In addition, the assailant must have
intended to prevent the victim from exercising a federally
protected right, such as voting.
</P>
<P>
   The new measure would add attacks against people because of
their gender, sexual orientation or disabilities to the covered
crimes while eliminating the protected-right requirement. Thus, it
would make federal prosecutions easier to pursue and relieve local
jurisdictions from the financial burden of trying such
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters Monday shortly after the Capitol news
conference, President Clinton said at the White House, ``We must
pass strong hate-crimes legislation.'' He added, ``I want to
express my personal appreciation'' to the Shepards for coming here
to lobby for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   At the Capitol briefing, Sen. James Jeffords, R-Vt., pressed his
colleagues to adopt the measure before lawmakers adjourn in the
next several days. He cited reports that hate crimes against gays
and lesbians are on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be done, and it must be done,'' Jeffords said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., who assessed the chances of passage
at ``50-50,'' said gays and lesbians need federal protection.
``Some crimes are so odious that an extra measure of protection is
demanded by us so that (they) can never again be repeated among us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never again should we in the federal government withhold our
help and stand idly when a Matthew Shepherd is tied to a fence,
beaten and left to die because he is gay,'' Smith added.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Republican opponents of the measure of blockig its
passage ``because it has to do with the issue of homosexuality, and
many people are uncomfortable with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., issued a challenge to GOP colleagues
who oppose abortion rights. ``If you are really pro-life as you say
so often in so many debates, then prove it in this case _ that you
are ... pro-every human life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker at the news conference, Robert DeBree, an
Albany, Wyo., sheriff's detective, said that after McKinney was
found guilty last week of robbing, kidnapping and murdering
Shepard, he went back to a detention center and ``was smiling and
laughing'' as he watched news reports of himself on television.
</P>
<P>
   DeBree added, ``We have to got to send a message somewhere, and
it has to begin here. Congress, please pass this.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two states and the District of Columbia have hate-crime
laws that include sexual orientation while 20 have hate-crime laws
that do not. Eight states have no hate crimes laws.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to meeting with lawmakers, Dennis and Judy Shepard
met Monday with White House Chief of Staff John Podesta and
Attorney General Janet Reno. On Tuesday, Dennis Shepard said, he
will try to meet with Senate Majority Leader Sen. Trent Lott,
R-Miss.

   JASPER, Texas _ A judge has delayed testimony for a day in the
capital murder trial of Shawn Berry while he reviews thousands of
news stories and tapes to decide if the trial should be moved.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony had been set to begin Tuesday morning in one of the

a.m. CDT Wednesday on a last-minute request by defense attorney
Joseph ``Lum'' Hawthorn to move the trial.
</P>
<P>
   If Golden decides to keep the trial in Jasper, testimony will
begin Wednesday. Berry's two co-defendants were tried earlier in
Jasper and Bryan.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn had originally said he wanted Berry's trial to be held
in Jasper, where, he said, the 24-year-old manager of the local
theater had a good reputation. He said he changed his mind during
jury selection when potential jurors said they'd heard people in
the community express opinions that Berry is guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ``A jury can be influenced either consciously or unconsciously
by the sentiment of the community,'' Hawthorn said.
</P>
<P>
   Golden said he observed jury selection and all the jurors
qualified to serve ``appeared to be candid, honest, sincere and
completely unbiased in their answers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said lawyers in Berry's case took the same amount of time and
interviewed a similar number of potential jurors as attorneys did
when Berry's co-defendant, Russell Brewer, was tried in Bryan
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The judge added that there had been ``a substantial amount of
pre-trial publicity generated by the defendant's appearance on
CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn said much of the recent publicity had been from legal
wrangling between the Jasper County District Attorney's office and
CBS over unaired portions of an interview of Berry by network
anchorman Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I wanted to do was file a motion for change of
venue. I have always wanted the trial here,'' Hawthorn said Monday.
``But the latest round of publicity is just too much.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wasn't the one who subpoenaed CBS's out-takes and
that investigators and prosecutors could have watched and taped
last month's three-hour jailhouse interview, a small portion of
which appeared on ``60 Minutes II.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I assumed they had,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been picking a jury for two weeks, and the judge has
listened to all those jurors,'' Jasper County District Attorney Guy
James Gray said. ``That is the best evidence of whether you can get
a fair jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that you can go anywhere in this whole country,''
Gray said, adding that potential jurors in Bryan, where Brewer, 32,
was tried and sentenced to die, knew just as much about the case as
did those in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   A Jasper jury had earlier sentenced John William King, 25, to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant prosecutor Pat Hardy agreed. ``The bottom line is
Jasper County has been just doused with a ton of publicity.
However, no more than Harris County, no more than Smith County, no
more than London, England.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media coverage really doesn't throw a case out. It's got
to be that there is such a bias in that county that he can't get a
fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters from all over the world have flocked to the East Texas
town of 8,000 since June 7, 1998, when the dismembered body of
James Byrd Jr. was found after he was dragged for three miles along
back country roads.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorn handed Golden stacks of articles from newspapers as
well as transcripts of radio and television broadcasts. He said
three area television stations told him it would take at least a
week to produce copies of about a thousand news items broadcast on
the Byrd case since March.
</P>
<P>
   An obviously irritated Golden gave him until noon Tuesday to
submit what tapes he could get.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are expecting me to read all this, aren't you?'' Golden
snapped at Hawthorn, ``and you haven't even read it yourself, have
you?''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Monday's half-hour hearing provided the first
opportunity for Berry to hug his father since he was 3 years old.
``I've waited 21 years for this,'' said Louis Hezebicks of Geneva,
Ohio. ``This makes the 1,300-mile trip worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Hezebicks said he and Berry's mother, Kathleen Berry, never
married. Over the years he regretted not fighting to get custody of
Berry and his older brother, Louis, but ``back then I didn't even
know how to get into a courthouse, much less what my legal rights
were.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputies Monday brought King back to the Jasper County Jail from
Death Row as a potential witness. But King refused to cooperate and
was sent back. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q -- How do you deal with a manager who sounds
friendly and interested in the employees' ideas, but underneath
this facade insists that everything be done her way? She uses all
sorts of fancy management language, and she talks about employee
empowerment, but it's nothing more than talk. G.H.
</P>
<P>
   A -- In the political arena, this type of leader is referred to
as a benevolent dictator. Under her leadership, you are free to do
whatever you want, as long as you do whatever she wants.
</P>
<P>
   She may have considerable ability to absorb managerial concepts
and then verbalize them, such as her talk about employee
empowerment, but she does not realize the value that is associated
with applying this type of principle. The only empowerment that
truly interests her is her own.
</P>
<P>
   Some employees appreciate the structure, predictability and
security that is associated with her style of management. There is
minimal risk-taking, decision-making and change. Of course, this
also means that there tends to be minimal opportunity for
creativity, individuality and personal growth.
</P>
<P>
   If these latter factors are important to you, the reality is
that you are not likely to find them under this manager. However,
you should still try to discuss your ideas with her, and be sure
that you provide compelling and factual support for your
suggestions. It is possible that she may open the door to your
input. At the same time, if this door is permanently locked,
perhaps it is time for you to be thinking about a different door at
this company.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- One of the people in our group went to a prestigious
college and constantly brings it up. No matter what kind of project
we are working on, sooner or later, he relates it to something
about his college. We are all college grads, and we're not
impressed with him or his college. We've tried to get the message
across, but he doesn't get it. How do we deal with him? B.T.
</P>
<P>
   A -- He may be deservedly proud of his college classes, but his
behavior shows no class at all. Rather, it points to a good deal of
insecurity. If he were confident and comfortable with his career
progress and accomplishments, he would have far less need to keep
bringing up his prestigious college days.
</P>
<P>
   This means there is a real possibility that his collegiate
stories will diminish as he experiences some major success in his
current position. Unfortunately, his fixation with his college days
may prevent him from doing so.
</P>
<P>
   He probably does not realize that recent studies are showing
that success after college depends more on the individual than on
the college the individual attended. The fact is, the college may
help a person get that first job, but then something called
performance tends to predominate.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you have already told him that his college-speak
is not appreciated, so perhaps the next step is to try to help him
be more successful in the job. If your discussions with him focus
more on present and future projects, objectives and performance,
perhaps he will be less likely to focus on the past.
</P>
<P>
   Q -- During a job interview a few days ago, the interviewer took
several phone calls and his secretary came in three or four times.
I thought this was rude and inconsiderate, and I think the
interruptions prevented me from doing well. What is your take on
interruptions in job interviews? T.K. &QL; 
!tag!d &QC; 3,3!tag!A!off! It sounds as though you just went
through an amateur interview, and if you are seeking a professional
company, this type of treatment may be giving you some real insight
into the way this company operates.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, there can be interruptions during a job interview if
there is a bona fide emergency. However, the phone calls and
intermittent secretarial visits you described did not appear to
have any sense of urgency, or for that matter, any sense at all.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, job interviews should be private and free of
interruptions. In fact, interruptions create real problems for the
interviewers as well as for the interviewees. Interruptions can
cause interviewers to get distracted, miss key points, omit
necessary follow-up questions, and generally obtain an inaccurate
picture of the applicant.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the interviewee, interruptions break their train of
thought, prevent them from providing full information, generate
feelings of frustration, and raise questions about the company
itself.
</P>
<P>
   In today's tight labor market, one important factor that
determines an applicant's interest in a company is the way in which
he or she is treated during the interview process. Companies that
allow countless interruptions during job interviews are also
allowing countless applicants to slip away.

   HEALTHCARE-INSURE (Undated) _ In a dramatic break with a
longstanding element of managed care that infuriated many doctors
and frustrated their patients, United Health Group says it is
giving up its veto power over medical decision making. United, one
of the nation's biggest managed care companies, says that a
patient's doctor, not the insurance company, will now be able to
decide whether to admit health plan members to a hospital or
provide other treatment. By Milt Freudenheim. (We plan to move the

   GERMANY-WALL (Berlin) _ Virtally nobody predicted the fall of
the Berlin Wall _ and apparently nobody planned it. As a result,
two German states with divergent ideologies and cultures found
themselves propelled toward union on the panicky reaction of a
border guard who opened the gate at Berlin's Bornholmerstrasse
crossing without an explicit order to do so. Some of the effects of
that precipitation are still evident today. Most fundamentally, a
united Germany is not quite sure of its identity. By Roger Cohen.

   SCOTUS-DEATH-PENALTY (Washington) _ The question, as framed for
the Supreme Court by lawyers for death row inmates in Florida and

be carried out is itself so ``cruel and unusual'' as to be
unconstitutional. It was a question the court announced that it
would not answer. The justices turned down appeals by two convicted
murderers, and the action left in place a system under which the
length of time a person spends on death row is free of
constitutional scrutiny. By Linda Greenhouse. (The story has moved

   WEB-ENTERTAINMENT (Los Angeles) _ Until now, Hollywood has used
the Internet mainly to promote films and television programs,
rather than to transmit them. But a growing number of players, from
big studios to small entrepreneurs, are starting to provide
entertainment on the Web, either by delivering existing movies and
television shows or by creating programs specifically for online
viewing. The efforts could allow for development of new types of

   BUSH-ENVIRON (Austin, Texas) _ Early this summer, with political

industrial plants that are among the heaviest polluters in Texas.
For Bush, the program meant confronting the state's oil, gas and

contributors. Bush now boasts that he is the first Texas governor
``to ever have brought industry together and said, `Get into
compliance.''' But what he actually did was a little different. By

 &HT;    One-of-a-kind facility
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENGLEWOOD, Ohio _ When Good Samaritan Hospital officials decided
to build a center for outpatient treatment, they looked around the
country for a similar facility that didn't feel like a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't one. We had to create our own model,'' says Anne
McNeill, the Good Sam vice president who directs Samaritan North
Health Center. So they hired an architect that had worked in both
the health-care and hotel businesses, and they enlisted patients,
teachers and government leaders to tell them what an outpatient
center should look like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not just for focus groups,'' McNeill says. ``We kept them
involved in work groups all the way through.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than five years after Sam North opened, McNeill hears two
or three times a month from hospital administrators who want to see
the center. The outpatient facilities' trade group gave Sam North a
national award this year for its customer focus in a project called
``Creating New Levels of Customer Satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   With an open house Sunday, Samaritan North will unveil a $37
million expansion that more than doubles its size and makes it the
largest free-standing outpatient center in the country. Now 329,000
square feet, it has new surgery, sleep-disorders and well-being
centers, along with much bigger areas for rehabilitation and
doctors' offices.
</P>
<P>
   Outpatient services are growing fast throughout the area, mostly
because health plans are paying for far fewer overnight hospital
stays. But most hospitals' outpatient facilities are on their main
campuses, such as Kettering Medical Center's well-regarded women's
and cancer-care centers at Southview Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of physicians who wanted to come out here because
their patients were telling them that's where they wanted to go,''
McNeill says. ``People don't like to go to hospitals. This doesn't
feel like a hospital, but it has almost everything a hospital has
in it.''
</P>
<P>
   So as proud as she is of the cancer center's high-tech linear
accelerator for radiation therapy, McNeill also points out the
skylight above the patient's bed, where people can look at
stained-glass dogwood branches and listen to soothing music while
their tumors are being bombarded with radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the fancy equipment in the outpatient surgery center,
patients can take advantage of valet parking and the natural light
flowing through atriums and windows. In upgrading the rear entrance
for rehab and the doctor's offices, Sam North also added a
waterfall to its manmade lake and landscaped its parking deck with
a view of the deer and Canada geese that wander past.
</P>
<P>
   As a variety of health-care venues springs up, hospitals are
feeling the need to view patients more as discerning customers than
as passive victims. All five general hospitals in Montgomery County
are using consultants or task forces to help them think more like
retailers in catering to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patients bring in their computer printouts and want to know,
`Do you have this?' and `Can I get that?''' McNeill says. ``In this
day of health care, you better be looking at everything through the
eyes of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaritan North has done away with all the public-address paging
and most of the white coats that people so closely associate with
places for the sick. Its walls and floors are earth-toned, its
elevator doors look like entries to Cape Cod homes and some of its
bathrooms have homey mood lighting. The furnishings even in
clinical areas run more toward wood and wicker than plastic and
metal.
</P>
<P>
   There's a free child-care room for kids of the many patients who
make regular trips for rehab or treatment. McNeill tells of an MRI
technician who found out his elderly patient was taking the bus
home, so he took her to the bus stop and waited until he could help
her into her seat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really what we expect of the people who work here,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Before this expansion, Samaritan North was primarily for cancer
care, rehab and diagnostic testing. It now has 135 doctors' offices
instead of 50, a rehab and sports medicine center with a
health-club ambiance even outside the new aerobics room, and a
surgical area of 24,000 square feet with four operating rooms,
another for laser eye surgery and two rooms for such procedures as
endoscopies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do anything that doesn't require an extended stay or an
intensive care unit,'' says the unit's director, Stephen Speak. The
recovery room has a soundproof area in anticipation of an increase
in outpatient pediatric surgery, and the patients will go from
pre-operative rooms to surgery by foot or in wheel chairs.
``There's nothing as debilitating as being rolled on a gurney and
looking up at the ceiling,'' Speak says.
</P>
<P>
   Sam North's free-standing surgicenter is the third such
partnership between doctors and a hospital in Montgomery County,
but its scope is broader than those of Kettering's eye center and
Miami Valley Hospital's orthopedics center. As with any outpatient
surgery center away from a hospital, the disadvantage is that if
anything goes wrong, the patient must be transported to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The new wellness center at Sam North gives a home to existing
programs for tai chi, yoga and meditation and adds rooms for
massage, counseling, aromatherapy and other alternative techniques.
Its health-information library, says McNeill, reflects the medical
industry's trend away from just treating illnesses to teaching
people about health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to what we told people when we opened this,''
says Good Sam president Douglas Deck. ``We want to be a part of the
community's wellness, not just its illness.''

   KHWAJA BAHAOUDDIN, Afghanistan _ The Lion of the Panjshir is not
a big man, especially so for someone thought to be Afghanistan's
greatest guerrilla fighter. With his beret cocked to the side and
his brow in a pensive wrinkle, he has the look of a Beat Generation
poet, more at home in a basement coffee house than in high-altitude
combat.
</P>
<P>
   This nation, so poor otherwise, is rich with storied commanders,
bearded chieftains loping through the mountains, stopping only to
praise Allah or to set an ambush.
</P>
<P>
   But among them, only the Lion _ Ahmed Shah Massoud _ is left to
fight on against the Taliban militia, the others all killed or
chased into exile or bought off with cash.
</P>
<P>
   Some 85 percent to 90 percent of this nation is controlled by
the Taliban, known worldwide for their justice by amputation and
the forced head-to-toe swathing of women. What remains for them to
conquer _ and they have tried and tried and tried _ is the land
that has long been Massoud's lair, Afghanistan's far northeast,
which includes the Panjshir Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Winter is fast closing in, and soon the mountain passes of the
cragged Hindu Kush will be snowbound, ending the prime weather for
warfare. Massoud's forces have beaten back coordinated assaults by
the Taliban on two fronts, including a stunning nighttime
counterattack on Aug. 4 that has further magnified the Lion's
mystique for cunning.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the flatlands of the north, Massoud recently shuttled
back and forth between the combat five miles away and his
stronghold in Khwaja Bahaouddin. One afternoon, while in
conversation, he suddenly dropped to the floor with a blank sheet
of paper and sketched a rough map that at first seemed a rendering
of an amoeba.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Afghanistan,'' he proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   He grew excited. ``The Taliban came at us from five directions,
so we withdrew all our forces and collected in the Panjshir
Valley,'' he said, furiously drawing arrows to show the early
August troop movements. ``Two nights later, after they assumed we
had fled for our lives, we hit back at them here and here and here
and here.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped to take a call from the battlefield on one of his
several satellite telephones, positioned a few feet away on the
carpeted floor next to his fax machine. Then he continued with the
arrows. ``Here and here also,'' he said. ``They were asleep when we
attacked them. By 5 a.m., everything was finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-congratulations still in the air, he abruptly turned
reflective.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, the fighting seems to go on and on,'' his brow
folding into three neat vertical lines. ``So much fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   At 46, Massoud has spent more than half his years at war,
beginning while he was an engineering student in Kabul. He has
fought against a dictator, the Soviet army and the Taliban. An
ethnic Tajik, he has also been at war with other Afghan guerrillas,
their ethnicities different from his and their loyalties notably
fluid.
</P>
<P>
   He rarely sleeps in the same place two nights in a row. He
seldom gets to return to his family home in the Panjshir, where he
has a library with 3,000 books. His wife and five children live in
Dushanbe, the capital of neighboring Tajikistan, where they are
safer.
</P>
<P>
   He is a man who wanted to be an architect in a nation that was
once starting to prosper, and instead he became a military
tactician in a woebegone country whose cities are in ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it will end, I don't know,'' Massoud said with the
exaggerated shrug of a man fighting less now for victory than
survival. ``But what choice is there?''
</P>
<P>
   He then employed a dramatic gesture that he has used before,
dropping his Afghan beret _ the brown pakool, which looks like a
pie crust _ to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all the space I need to fight,'' said the Lion of the
Panjshir.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Afghanistan is a nation of 18 million to 24 million people.
Proper figures are hard to come by, the land is so numb with death.
Between 1 million and 1.5 million people have been killed during 21
years of war. Perhaps another 4 million have fled. It is a nation
where every major road has been torn apart by tank treads. Every
major building has been blown full of holes.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, from 1979 to 1989, the country's pinnacled mountains
_ severe as a moonscape _ made an icy center stage for the Cold
War. The Soviet army had invaded, and the West supported the Afghan
resistance with the latest tools of battle.
</P>
<P>
   With their rifles slung over their shoulders, and with their
long-tailed shirts flapping beneath woolen waistcoats, these
mountain warriors _ the so-called mujahedeen _ struck as bold a
pose as any Hollywood icon.
</P>
<P>
   Massoud, among the best-known, was a prime target for the
Soviets. They invaded the Panjshir seven times. Each attempt
failed. Once, in 1983, Massoud and the Soviets agreed on a
carefully worded one-year cease-fire in the valley. The guerrilla
commander used the pause to organize new fronts and operate outside
the Panjshir.
</P>
<P>
   When the Soviets left Afghanistan in ignoble retreat, the
attention of the West drifted. In war, the mujahedeen had seemed to
most of the world to be a monolithic horde of freedom fighters. In
triumph, they revealed themselves to be fractured by a multitude of
ancestries _ Pathans, Uzbeks, Hazaras, Tajiks, Turkmen _ their
hatreds stoked by age-old ethnic and tribal rivalries as well as
modern-day avarice and the thirst for power.
</P>
<P>
   Burhanuddin Rabbani, a former theology professor, became the
nation's president in 1992. Massoud, a one-time protege and
long-time ally, was named defense minister. But the Tajik-dominated
government, tottering from day one, could not unify so divided a
land.
</P>
<P>
   Kabul, the capital, became a war zone, awakening each day to
blasts from rockets and artillery. Mujahedeen commanders, each with
his own militia, made alliances, double-crossed each other, allied
again. The nation was lawless.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, with their puritanical version of Islam, were born
of this chaos. Its fighters were largely Pathan students from
religious schools favored by refugees and the poor. They promised
to right the wayward country, and while their formidable military
operations were assisted by neihboring Pakistan, the key to their
success was their welcome by the masses.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban marched into Kabul in September 1996. Massoud barely
escaped with his life. To the end, he says now, he found himself
arguing with the treacherous commanders of other militias about who
would defend what parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Again, he reached for paper and drew a map, but this time no
smiles accompanied the arrows. The Rabbani government had been a
failure, and the Lion of the Panjshir could only say: ``I evacuated
my forces without taking casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years of rule, the Taliban find themselves in bad
repute internationally, what with their strict prohibition of
television, music, card playing, kite flying and beard trimming,
punishable with whippings and imprisonment. Women are not permitted
to be seen in public, girls are denied schooling. The government is
the host of Osama bin Laden, the man thought responsible for the
bombing of two U.S. embassies in Africa last year. Military
training camps are many, attracting foreigners ready for martyrdom.
</P>
<P>
   Massoud, a man alert to the need for a persona, is keen to
present himself as an alternative. He is deeply religious, often
fingering a strand of red prayer beads, but he and his top aides
stress that their Islamic practices are far from tyrannical.
</P>
<P>
   In Dushanbe, Massoud's lieutenants sometimes dine at the Casino
restaurant, where waitresses wear short skirts and a rock band
plays ``Hotel California.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our Islam is not in contradiction to the world community,''
Mohammad Daoud Panjsheri, one of Massoud's aides said eagerly.
``The world should help us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lion is determinedly coy about how he pays for his waging of
war, but it is unlikely that the world has denied him help. Barnett
Rubin, who follows Afghanistan at the Council on Foreign Relations
in New York, said that Iran, Russia and others assist Massoud,
``trying to keep the Taliban menace out of Central Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerald and lapis lazuli mines in the mountainous northeast also
produce revenues, and, in a perplexing bit of banking, the Massoud
forces control the printing of Afghan currency. The Rabbani
government _ formally the Islamic State of Afghanistan _ is still
the one recognized by most nations, though Rabbani lives in
Dushanbe.
</P>
<P>
   Printing money may have its lucrative equal only in the growing
of it, which is the approach of some of the Taliban. This year,
Afghanistan's crop of raw opium was estimated by the United
Nations' International Drug Control Program to be a record 5,070
tons _ about 75 percent of the global yield. Despite disavowals,
the government not only seems to tolerate the trade but taxes it as
it is trucked to distribution points outside the country.
</P>
<P>
   However financed, war in Afghanistan is often catch-as-catch-can
for so well-practiced an activity. The nation has dozens of
independent ``commanders,'' each with his own weapons and
following. Massoud must continually woo allies with dickering and
cajolery. He seems to be able to reliably field 12,000 to 15,000
men, said Anthony Davis, a military analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The more disciplined Taliban can count on a militia of about
45,000, Davis said, though they too depend on volunteers. Before
last summer's offensive, Mullah Mohammad Omar, the Taliban's
supreme leader, beseeched students in madrasahs, or religious
schools, to join the jihad. Thousands rallied to the call,
including busloads who came from Pakistan with that government's
apparent godspeed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Pakistan's money, munitions, and military advice have
long been evident, the alleged participation of its regular army
units in combat remains unproven.
</P>
<P>
   In a jail in the Panjshir, a dozen Pakistani prisoners of war
sat sadly. Muhammad Saleh, 22, a student from Karachi recovering
from bullet wounds to the stomach, was typical.
</P>
<P>
   Madrasah teachers had sent him off to fight ``the Russians and
other infidels,'' he said. He had received 15 days of meager
training, capped by the opportunity to fire three shots, one each
from the standing, sitting and prone positions.
</P>
<P>
   His time in battle had lasted three days. ``When the Taliban
retreated, we weren't aware they had left,'' he said. ``Then we saw
people with rifles, and they called out to us, `Who are you?' And
when we told them we were Taliban, they were so angry they shot us.
We'd be dead if we hadn't begged them and convinced them we were
good Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Mealtime with Massoud is not necessarily an inelegant repast. At
the Khwaja Bahaouddin stronghold, food is served outdoors beneath
the shade of two giant maples within sight of a fast-moving river.
Carpets cover the ground, and tablecloths cover the carpets. Boys
wait at attention with huge platters of rice while diners settle
in, sitting cross-legged. Even with 20 guests, everyone gets a
metal tea pot.
</P>
<P>
   The aging Rabbani, who lives in Dushanbe, remains the titular
president of his ever-shrinking Afghan jurisdiction, but it is
Massoud who makes most decisions, civilian or military. Battered
and cranky Soviet-era helicopters drop off a regular supply of
visitors near the front lines, many of them commanders allied with
Massoud and others who are considering it. He seats them at his
side at mealtime and tells them of his democratic vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stop the fighting, we are ready to join the Taliban in a
temporary state with a neutral head,'' he said. ``Then we must go
on to elections and let the people decide.''
</P>
<P>
   If Massoud can survive the next inevitable Taliban offensive,
his chances to negotiate such a deal would seem to depend on two
long shots: that Pakistan, under its new military government, will
cut back its support and push the Taliban into talks _ or that
large numbers of Pathans, the nation's biggest ethnic group, will
rebel against their pious brethren.
</P>
<P>
   At one of those mealtimes, with a sporadic breeze rustling the
maple leaves above, the Lion was flanked by two Uzbek commanders
who have joined him in making war.
</P>
<P>
   With the rice eaten, and toffee now brought out to go with the
final sips of tea, the men were angrily condemning the Taliban for
having burned people's crops and homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must defeat, defeat, defeat them,'' Massoud said, his right
hand cutting karate chops through the air. Then his mood lightened,
enough for him to make a joke for his Uzbek confederates.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we must defeat the Taliban,'' he said. ``Then we can
fight each other.''

WHAT IS RIGHT RIGHT-OF-WAY FOR CYCLISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a gray area in the California Vehicle Code is
causing a black-and-white showdown with deadly results on the
twisty back roads of the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   Every time a group of bike riders encounter a speeding car on
one of the narrow country roads in the foothills, there becomes a
moment of truth and decision: The cyclists often intentionally
block the car, citing it unsafe to yield the lane _ and legal under
the Vehicle Code to drive in the roadway of a narrow road.
</P>
<P>
   The car driver, irate at being blocked and believing it illegal
for the cyclists to impede traffic, often forges ahead, forcing the
group to the side and into danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law says the bicyclist shall ride as close as practical to
the right side of the road,'' said Len Stone of the Bicyclery in
Half Moon Bay. ``The problem is that everyone has a different
definition of what it means to be `as close as practical.' That
makes it a gray area for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   In two dozen calls to county sheriffs in Marin, San Mateo, Santa
Clara, Alameda and Contra Costa counties, only sheriff deputy Lou
Lozano of the Alameda County Sheriff's Department would stick his
neck out and issue a clarification: ``If they're (bicyclists) going
to be in the street, they can be cited for impeding the flow of
traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   That comment, quoted in a recent San Francisco Examiner story,
inspired dozens of responses from cyclists. They revealed how
dangerous right-of-way showdowns between cars and cyclists are the
most contentious outdoors recreation issue in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Motor Vehicles, more than 100
cyclists are killed in accidents each year, and ``hundreds of
thousands more'' are injured.
</P>
<P>
   In e-mails, cyclists explained that there is a moment of truth
when riding a back road, car vs. bike, with no room to spare: ``A
bicyclist trying to ride along the edge will be subjected to
sideswipes and their consequences. When conditions permit, a
bicyclist should allow other traffic to pass, but he should not
compromise his own safety to do so.'' _ Alan Forkosh. Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riders are not required to ride single file, especially on the
narrow roads to which you refer in your article. If you are riding
in a group on a narrow road (one that is too narrow for a car and a
bike to safely travel side by side) and you ride single file, as
the motorist expects, nine times out of 10 the motorist will
attempt to pass, make it past the first trailing few riders and
then encounter a corner and pull into the sides of the middle
riders. It is far, far safer for us to bunch up and `take the
lane,' which is ours after all, until the road widens sufficiently
for the car to be able to pass safely. As it is our butts that are
on the line, don't you think that it is fair for us to decide when
it's safe to pass?'' _ Oren Noah.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowhere in the California Vehicle Code does it require riders
to ride single file. ... The sad fact is that most law enforcement
officers are just as ignorant of the Vehicle Code, re bicycle
riding, as the rest of the general public.'' _ Casey Kerrigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No cyclist enjoys having an impatient driver behind them.
Cyclists will facilitate passing when it's safe to do so.'' _ Dean
Ruggles, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that you ride as far to the right as you can, but
it's up to the bicyclist, based on his/her assessment of how safe
the conditions are, to decide how far that is. What many drivers do
realize is that the far right edge of the roadway is not always a
safe place to ride. There may be glass, debris, poor pavement,
sewer grates and other hazards that may cause conditions to be very
unsafe. . . . At times this may require the driver to slow down a
bit and/or wait a few seconds. It is hard for me to understand how
waiting a few seconds can be used to rationalize the rage directed
at bicyclists.'' _ Art Wong, Valley Spokesmen Bicycle Touring Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, those poor drivers. Forced to follow cyclists. Even more
demoralizing than following a ... bus. I guess some homicide is
perfectly justifiable. But seriously, there's another law of
physics you forgot to mention. It's the over 100-to-1 weight ratio
enjoyed by those unfortunate drivers. Show us the stats of drivers
killed by cyclists. I'd be interested in reading about that.'' _
Mark Roderick.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Motor Vehicles provides an excellent web site
on the internet for bicycle safety, rider contacts and the vehicle
code. It can be accessed at www.dmv.ca.gov/about/bicycle.htm.
</P>
<P>
   From this site, you can read Vehicle Code Section 21202, which
states, in part: ``(a) Any person operating a bicycle upon a
roadway at a speed less than the normal speed of traffic moving in
the same direction at that time shall ride as close as practicable
to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway ...''
</P>
<P>
   However, exceptions include ``when reasonably necessary to avoid
conditions that make it unsafe to continue along the right-hand
curb or edge,'' and then specifies a narrow road as one of those
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   And thus two groups, car drivers vs. bike riders, each
respectively believing they have the right of way, confront each
other on the back roads again and again, ready to fight over a
small patch of asphalt.

 &HT;    Depot's Expo revamped, ready to open another store
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It took a while, but Home Depot is finally ready to
show its shimmer off to the hometown.
</P>
<P>
   The retailer's new Expo Design Center in Alpharetta, Ga., could
be followed by at least four more in metro Atlanta, President
Bryant Scott said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpharetta Expo, which opens Thursday, is the second Expo in
Georgia. The first opened 1994, when executives were still
struggling with the upscale format.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gotten better with every Expo we've opened,'' Scott said
during a tour of the new store. ``Now we're ready to roll it out in
a big way'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   The Expo division, designed to sell renovation and decor in a
showroom setting, is in the midst of a nationwide rollout.
Executives have been reworking the concept for eight years. The
first Expo opened in San Diego in 1991, followed by stores in
Atlanta and Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the sixth Expo opened in Davie, Fla., last year, the
concept had been completely revamped. The Alpharetta store differs
dramatically from previous Expos, for example, with a heavier focus
on lighting and rugs. Lamps, furniture and kitchens are displayed
in lifelike rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Expo aims to take the best from interior design
showrooms and put them under one roof. ``People say it's like
walking through a magazine,'' Scott said. ``We're opening up a new
channel of distribution for products that were only available in
small retail stores or through designers.''
</P>
<P>
   Expo currently operates 13 stores. The company has announced
that it plans to have 26 Expos open by the end of next year and 200
in North America by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say they've heard discussions of a much more
aggressive expansion. Some estimates call for as many as 500 Expos,
said analyst Dan Wewer of Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home Depot has an open playing field with Expo,'' Wewer said.
``Lowe's (Home Improvement Warehouse) is not moving into this
business...and Sears isn't really a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. is trying to compete with Expo with its new
home project store called The Great Indoors. Last month, Sears said
it will build 15 stores over the next year and a half, including
some in Expo markets. Despite Sears' early success with its first
Great Indoors in Denver, analysts generally expect Expo to
out-muscle the retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have new competition, it's a threat, but it also
makes you better at what you do,'' said analyst Wayne Hood of
Prudential Securities.
</P>
<P>
   One key to Expo's success is how well the retailer can manage
the order and delivery end of the business, Hood said. In a
complete kitchen remodel, for example, the components for the
flooring, cabinets and countertops typically arrive in many pieces
at different times.
</P>
<P>
   ``That calls for a completely different set of systems than what
you'd find at a Home Depot (warehouse) store,'' Hood said. ``In the
early days of Expo, the systems side of the business was a problem,
but they're doing a much better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Expo's Scott, who has beep president since 1995, admits he
didn't fully appreciate the operational differences between Home
Depot and Expo in the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone buys a drill at Home Depot, that transaction is
over at the cash register,'' Scott said. ``At Expo, when they write
their check or pull out a charge card, it's only the beginning of
the process.'' Indeed, it can take months to design, order and
install a kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Expo has had some growing pains in learning the installation
side of the business, too. In light of a tight labor market, it has
been a challenge to coordinate installers, Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Expo has improved its service level in the past year.
Expo representatives now try to contact each customer following an
installation project to get feedback. Last year, Scott started
tying 10 percent of each store manager's compensation to that
customer feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say they're comfortable with the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're paying more attention to follow-up,'' Wewer said.
``They wouldn't be expanding Expo if they hadn't worked on this,
because they wouldn't jeopardize the Home Depot name.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The question, as framed for the Supreme Court by
lawyers for death row inmates in Florida and Nebraska, was whether
_ all other arguments about the death penalty aside _ a
decades-long wait for a death sentence to be carried out is itself
so ``cruel and unusual'' as to be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   It was a question that the court announced Monday it would not
answer. The justices turned down appeals by two convicted
murderers, one on Nebraska's death row for nearly 20 years, the
other on Florida's for nearly 25. The action left in place a system
under which the length of time a person spends on death row is free
of constitutional scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the prolonged residence on death row was due in
substantial part to the state's response to the inmate's successful
challenge to unconstitutional state procedures; rather than proceed
quickly to new trials, as the lower courts had ordered, the states
spent years appealing the adverse rulings back up through the
judicial system. Eventually, the states prevailed and the inmates
were resentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   While the inmates failed Monday to get the necessary four votes
for review, they undoubtedly got the court's attention. Justice
Stephen Breyer, who wanted the court to hear the appeals, and
Justice Clarence Thomas, who emphatically did not, engaged in an
unusual written exchange that lifted the curtain a bit on the kind
of internal debate over the court's agenda-setting function that
usually remains hidden from public view.
</P>
<P>
   While Breyer stopped short of taking a stand on the merits of
the inmates' claim that their prolonged incarceration violated the
Eighth Amendment, he said their argument ``cannot be rejected out
of hand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both these cases involve astonishingly long delays flowing in
significant part from constitutionally defective death penalty
procedures,'' Breyer said. He added: ``When a delay, measured in
decades, reflects the state's own failure to comply with the
Constitution's demands, the claim that time has rendered the
execution inhuman is a particularly strong one. I believe this
court should consider that claim now.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas vigorously disagreed. ``It is incongruous to arm capital
defendants with an arsenal of `constitutional' claims with which
they may delay their executions, and simultaneously to complain
when executions are inevitably delayed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas named several recent Supreme Court decisions that
expanded the rights of inmates, suggesting that the court's
``Byzantine death penalty jurisprudence'' was responsible for the
long delays through undue solicitude for defendants' rights.
``Consistency would seem to demand that those who accept our death
penalty jurisprudence as a given also accept the lengthy delay
between sentencing and execution as a necessary consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer noted that courts in a number of other countries that
share with the United States the English common-law tradition,
including Jamaica, India and Zimbabwe, have concluded that long
delays are ``inhuman.'' In an unusually modern touch for a Supreme
Court opinion, he gave the Internet address for a decision issued
three months ago by the supreme court of Zimbabwe:
www.law.wits.ac.za/salr/catholic.html. The views of foreign courts
``are useful even though not binding,'' Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas dismissed this line of inquiry. ``Were there any such
support in our own jurisprudence,'' he said, there would be no need
to search for foreign evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The only other justice who entered the discussion was Justice
John Paul Stevens, who offered a one-sentence caution against
extrapolating the court's view on the merits of the issue from its
refusal to hear the cases, Knight vs. Florida, No. 98-9741, and
Moore vs. Nebraska, No. 99-5291.
</P>
<P>
   It was Stevens who had first identified the issue in 1995, when
he called for review of a Texas inmate's claim that 17 years on
death row was cruel and unusual. In that case, Lackey vs. Texas,
Stevens said the question deserved the attention of the state and
lower federal courts. Breyer indicated his agreement in that case
and in a subsequent one from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, dozens of inmates have raised similar claims, none
successfully. Ordinarily, the Supreme Court waits for a conflict to
develop among the lower courts before agreeing to hear a case, and
the absence of such a conflict may have persuaded some justices
against adding the issue to the court's docket.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was another significant development at the court Monday.
The court accepted an appeal under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act that could also determine how other types of job
discrimination cases are handled in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The question is what happens once an employer's explanation for
allegedly discriminatory behavior is shown to be a pretext. Does
the plaintiff then have the right to take the case to a jury? Or is
the company nonetheless entitled to a dismissal of the lawsuit at
this stage if the plaintiff cannot meet the further burden of
producing direct evidence of discriminatory intent, a difficult
legal test known as ``pretext plus''?
</P>
<P>
   This case, Reeves vs. Sanderson Plumbing Products Inc., No.
99-536, is an appeal by a Mississippi man who was fired at age 57
after being told by a supervisor that he was ``too damn old to do
the job.'' After showing that the employer's explanation for his
dismissal was pretextual, he won his age discrimination case before
a federal court jury, which awarded him $98,000.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in New Orleans,
overturned the verdict and ruled that the case should have been
dismissed before reaching the jury because the plaintiff, Roger
Reeves, had failed to meet the ``pretext plus'' standard of
providing evidence that his firing resulted from intentional
discrimination.

COMMENTARY: A MILLENNIAL HIT PARADE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than eight weeks until the turn of the millennium, and
somehow things don't seem ready. All those books, magazines, TV
specials and Y2K conferences, and still it doesn't feel as if the
whole thing has sunk into the popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Even the advertising industry seems a little slow to go into
hyperdrive. M&AMP;M's has named itself the millennial candy, in what
may be the only marketing campaign in history to rely on the
consumer's knowledge of Roman numerals. But frankly, we got more
mass merchandising for the Statue of Liberty's 100th birthday
party. Where's the official millennial cheese dip? The 5,000 Elvis
impersonators singing in the year 2000?
</P>
<P>
   For years now, I've been imagining driving along sometime in
December 1999 and hearing the radio announcer say: ``And now, the
Top Ten Tunes of the Millennium!'' But it doesn't feel as if we're
going to get there. Oh sure, somebody will ask you to vote via
Internet on whether the Beatles were better than Frank Sinatra, but
I was hoping for something with a little more effort.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago I did talk three music writers, John Rockwell and Jon
Pareles of The Times and Robert Christgau of The Village Voice,
into coming up with just the kind of list we're missing out on.
Their Top Ten Tunes of the Millennium are:
</P>
<P>
   (BU) ``Ave Maria''
</P>
<P>
   (BU) Brahms' ``Lullaby''
</P>
<P>
   (BU) ``La Donna e Mobile''
</P>
<P>
   (BU) ``Greensleeves''
</P>
<P>
   (BU) ``Happy Birthday''
</P>
<P>
   (BU) ``La Marseillaise''
</P>
<P>
   (BU) ``A Mighty Fortress Is Our God''
</P>
<P>
   (BU) ``L'Homme Arme''
</P>
<P>
   (BU) ``Oh! Susanna''
</P>
<P>
   (BU) ``Louie, Louie''
</P>
<P>
   ``L'Homme Arme,'' by the way, is a French folk tune that was
used as the theme for medieval and Renaissance mass settings. I
suspect the explanation for ``Louie, Louie'' is that the list was
put together at the end of a very long party. It was made up quite
a while ago, which accounts for the absence of ``The Macarena'' and
that thing from ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Like all experts who get sucked into this sort of effort, my
list-makers apologized for sticking to European sources. But in my
experience, those who demand that their millennial overviews have
planetary scope are going to spend their New Year's Eve waiting for
the phone to ring. Runners-up, in case you're interested in making
a counter-list of your own, included ``Rockabye, Baby''; ``Yankee
Doodle''; ``Amazing Grace''; ``Rock of Ages''; ``Twinkle, Twinkle,
Little Star''; ``Auld Lang Syne''; Mendelssohn's ``Wedding March'';
``La Cucaracha''; ``After the Ball''; ``White Christmas'';
`Funiculi, Funicula''; ``Silent Night''; ``Stairway to Heaven'';
``Pange Lingua,'' and the first four notes of Beethoven's Fifth.
</P>
<P>
   I get a stronger feeling of connection to the march of history
with the top ten tunes than with millennial big thoughts,
interesting as they are. I like hearing about the rise of the
nation-state, but I got a bigger kick trying to pick the worst
wedding of the millennium. (A tie between Blessed Oda of Hainault's
nuptials in the 12th century, which were interrupted when the bride
cut off her nose, and Empress Zoe of Byzantium's marriage, which
took place after her fiance was given the choice of going through
with the ceremony or having his eyes poked out.)
</P>
<P>
   My vote for best party of the millennium was the feast given by
the Earl of Leicester for Queen Elizabeth I in 1575, which lasted a
week and featured a water pageant starring a 24-foot-long mermaid.
Worst party would be the costume ball given by Charles VI of France
in 1393 at which the Duc d'Orleans accidentally set fire to six
guests.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about the whole turn-of-the-millennium
celebration is that it gives us a chance to immerse ourselves in
history, to contemplate the fact that the world was really there
before we were born into it. A thousand years ago our European
ancestors were living in small villages surrounded by impenetrable
forests, so cut off from the rest of the world they could go their
whole lives without seeing a stranger. Ghosts and saints were more
real to them than the pope or the king. They never saw a book, a
calendar, a clock.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back from the other end of the millennium, we can barely
make them out. But if we use our imaginations, they can come to us
for just a moment, maybe humming a tune.

COMMENTARY: HYPOCRITES IN POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been contemptible Congresses before, and historians
can argue about which was worst. But I remember none in modern
times as dismal as the one now sitting, the 106th Congress. It has
set new records in cynicism and hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leaders of the House appoint, as conferees on a
bill to give patients more rights in managed-care health plans,
members who oppose the bill. Without debate, the House votes to
give an extra $1.7 billion in profits to companies that make
student loans _ $692 million to one company alone.
</P>
<P>
   They bleat about states' rights. But they push through a bill to
override the physician-assisted-suicide law twice approved by
Oregon voters, and another bill to bar state courts from hearing
class actions brought against industries that make big political
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to do what they want through the regular legislative
process, senators have tacked on to appropriation bills a dozen
riders stripping away environmental protections. Indeed, there
hardly is a regular legislative process anymore; controversial
measures are increasingly embodied in riders.
</P>
<P>
   But for me the most vicious example of the corrupted process was
the Senate's 54-to-45 vote last month to reject the nomination of
Justice Ronnie White of the Missouri Supreme Court to a federal
district judgeship. Every one of the 55 Republican senators except
one who was absent voted against White. They all did so at the
urging of their ultra-conservative colleague John Ashcroft of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft charged that White was ``pro-criminal,'' had ``a
serious bias against the death penalty'' and showed ``a tremendous
bent toward criminal activity.'' As first demonstrated in a column
by Benjamin Wittes of The Washington Post, those statements were
lies.
</P>
<P>
   In support of his charge that White is biased against the death
penalty, Ashcroft cited the case of a black defendant, Brian
Kinder, sentenced to death for murder. When the Missouri Supreme
Court affirmed the conviction, White dissented. Ashcroft said the
basis for the dissent was that the trial judge, Earl Blackwell, had
said he ``opposed affirmative action.'' That was a brazen
falsehood.
</P>
<P>
   Blackwell was running for re-election to the bench. A week
before the Kinder trial he announced that he was switching parties
to Republican because ``the Democrat party places far too much
emphasis on representing minorities such as homosexuals, people who
don't want to work and people with a skin that's any color but
white ... While minorities need to be represented, of course, I
believe the time has come for us to place much more emphasis and
concern on the hard-working taxpayers in this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinder's lawyer asked Blackwell to recuse himself because of his
hostile statement suggesting that minorities were not
``hard-working taxpayers.'' The judge refused. The majority on the
State Supreme Court said the statement would not ``cause a
reasonable person to question the impartiality'' of Blackwell. It
was from that dubious assertion that White dissented.
</P>
<P>
   White has voted to uphold 41 death sentences. He dissented in
one case that involved the murder of a sheriff, and for that reason
Missouri sheriffs and the National Sheriffs' Association opposed
his confirmation. But the Missouri police organization endorsed
him, saying White's record ``has been far more supportive of the
rights of victims than of the rights of criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   The real reason for Ashcroft's opposition was that he is running
for re-election next year and wants to look tough on crime. What is
shocking is that the other Republicans joined in his cynical
performance _ even a supposed moderate like Arlen Specter, who
voted for White twice in committee, and then against him on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Because White is an African-American, the Republicans were
accused of racism in rejecting him. I think they were innocent of
that charge. They were guilty of something else: dirtying the
confirmation process and stabbing a good judge and a good man in
the back. Stuart Taylor Jr., The National Journal's respected legal
commentator, put it exactly: ``The Senate's vote and the smearing
of Justice White were shameful acts of pettiness and
partisanship.''

 &HT;    Survey shows costs rising in health care coverage
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ National employers are reporting health-care cost
increases of 8 percent to 10 percent for 2000, a new survey finds.
</P>
<P>
   Results of the survey of 600 employers by consulting firm Hewitt
Associates, released Monday, showed a second consecutive year of
benefits' costs rising toward the double-digit range, after years
of smaller increases.
</P>
<P>
   And the 2000 surge will mean higher costs for employees as well,
Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the cost increases in 2000 include the overall aging
of the population, and prescription-drug spending rising at more
than 18 percent a year, Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, insurers now are trying to pump up profits after
years of artificially keeping prices low to boost market share,
said Mike Marotta, a consultant with Hewitt Associates in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Health plans are getting tremendous pressure from shareholders
to make money,'' Marotta said.
</P>
<P>
   To compile the Atlanta market figures, for example, Hewitt
surveyed 16 large companies based in the Atlanta area. But smaller
companies in Georgia are reporting even bigger increases for health
insurance, according to the National Federation of Independent
Business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Premium increases from 15 percent to 25 percent are common,
with some insurers giving final quotes as high as 120 percent,''
said NFIB's Bert Fridlin. Hardest hit, he said, are employers that
cover fewer than 10 workers and dependents.
</P>
<P>
   Marotta said employers often respond to the price increases by
passing some of the costs on to employees, through higher premiums,
co-pays or deductibles. Workers, though, pay only about 20 percent
of the overall cost of health insurance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many companies in the survey said they will pass along at
least 25 percent of the cost increase to their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, with the average health plan projected to cost
$4,853 per employee next year, up from $4,412 in 1999, most
employees will pay $110 more for their health coverage next year,
Hewitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies also may start shopping for better prices in
local markets, rather than contracting with a single national
insurance plan, Marotta said.

RICE AS MUCH AT A LOSS FOR ANSWERS AS ANYONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GWEN KNAPP  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In Sunday's final sign of desperation, Jerry
Rice asked reporters to figure out what ails the 49ers. He said it
rhetorically, as a way out of a trap, his only way out.
</P>
<P>
   The questions came at him endlessly after the Niners' 27-6 loss
to Pittsburgh. He caught two passes all day, for two yards, but he
grabbed dozens of questions and ran with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you lost confidence in Jeff Garcia?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could tell Steve Mariucci to do one thing to improve
the offense, what would it be?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you envy John Elway for retiring from a championship
team?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two catches, two yards. Does that embarrass you personally?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, yes, it does,'' he replied to that last one, ``but a lot
of other things have to factor in also. So you know, I feel, I
don't know. To be honest with you, I don't know. Maybe you guys can
shed some light on it, but right now it's basically very hard to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, the franchise's longtime emblem of excellence, didn't know
which way to turn. Should he start ripping into everyone, cause a
furor, insist on changes that might be impossible to make? Or
should he be the quiet diplomat, which could be even more damaging
to team morale?
</P>
<P>
   ``You wish for more opportunities and try to be patient,'' Rice
said. ``I'm dealing with it, but sometimes that can work against
you because people, they feel like, ``OK, he's content.
</P>
<P>
   He feels like he doesn't have to go out there, show his
emotions, or go off (on a rant) during the week, or in the middle
of the game.' `` He's right about this. All those years, his
fussiness was an exasperating reminder that the 49ers were
chronically dissatisfied perfectionists. It was the team persona.
Rice embodied it more than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there isn't room for fussiness. Instead of perfectionism,
they seek competence. Instead of another career record, Rice seeks
. . . well, even he's not sure, but it certainly isn't two catches
for two yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to deal with because I have tasted the
best,'' he said after the Niners' fourth straight defeat and his
least productive game since his rookie season. ``I have been there,
on top for so many years, but what are you going to do? You can't
give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Half-seriously, Rice agreed that he might feel a little envious
of Elway, whose career had meaning right up to the last snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was raining so hard out there,'' Rice said, ``and when it
starts pouring down like that and when you've got things not really
going the way you want, you think about that. You really do. You're
like ``Wow, what am I doing out here?'''
</P>
<P>
   One answer: He's fulfilling a commitment. Rice clearly wants to
erase the stigma of last year's tantrums over his number of
catches. He wants his legacy to be one of dignity, of a
championship-maker, not as a me-first performer. He returned this
season vowing to behave as an elder statesman, a contributor to but
not the fulcrum of the team, a feisty opponent but a cooperative
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   So there have been no impetuous threats to retire if he didn't
get what he wanted. If this ship is sinking, he's not jumping off
for the sake of convenience. ``Right now, I'm just trying to fight
my way out of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he's not sure what that entails. Silence? Screaming? He can
understand why the Niners are flailing, but he can never accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say we're losing confidence in Jeff,'' he
said, laughing off a reporter's attempts to fill his mouth with
treason. ``As a whole, I think something has to happen. (Maybe)
it's going to take someone saying: ``Hey, let's open it up. We have
nothing to lose.' `` How predictable, right? A receiver wants to
open up the offense. But Rice also said he would prefer to see more
of a commitment to the run on a day like Sunday, when Charlie
Garner was galloping all over the field.
</P>
<P>
   Briefly, he reminisced about the old days, when 49ers receivers
had rehearsed lovely, precise routes, knowing exactly when and
where the ball would descend into their arms. ``It was
repetition,'' Rice said, snapping his fingers. ``It was automatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I like to have that offense? Yes, I would,'' he said,
``but I can't make that call. I wish I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the 49ers could try something different and fail all
the same. Rice knows the problem well. He's looking for answers,
from any source, anywhere. It's the only way he knows how to convey
desperation without declaring a surrender.

CLINTON PRESSES GOP LEADERS ON EDUCATION ISSUES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton pushed his case in budget
negotiations Monday for hiring more teachers, but Republican
leaders continued to balk, as both sides sought to work out
differences over Year 2000 spending matters before Veteran's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides sounded optimistic that a deal could be reached by
midnight Wednesday when the latest in a series of temporary
spending measures expires. But Clinton's demand for $1.4 billion in
education money dedicated specifically to hiring up to 100,000 new
teachers was still an obstacle as negotiations continued late
Monday evening. Congress has targeted Veteran's Day for
adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have offered $1.2 billion but are insisting that
states and local districts be given the flexibility to spend the
money any way they choose, whether on teachers or other pressing
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, however, calls that approach a reversal of the
commitment Republican leaders made last year when they agreed to
fund the first installment of his plan to hire up to 100,000 new
teachers over several years in an effort to reduce class sizes. The
White House said the 1999 funding had helped hire nearly 29,000 new
public school teachers, but Republicans disputed that claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the money. As a matter of fact, our
appropriations bill has more money in it for education than the
president asked for,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
referring to an extra $300 million that Republicans added to the
education budget for the 2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big issue is who controls it. Will Washington bureaucrats
assert and control where this money is used? Or will there be some
discretion at the local level based on what local needs are,
whether it's books or computers or training for teachers or for
teachers themselves?'' Lott, R-Miss., said.
</P>
<P>
   However, despite opposition among Republicans to Clinton's plan,
Lott said it was still possible to reach a compromise before
Veteran's Day on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to work through that in the next few days, and I
think we can. We certainly should,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he warned members to be prepared to work through next
week if necessary. If a deal can't be reached, Clinton might be
forced to delay a scheduled trip abroad that begins Friday, and a
number of senators and House members would be forced to cancel
planned trips abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get our work done, I assume that neither the
members nor the president will be going anywhere. We've got the
people's business to do, and that's here. Now, we can do it by
Wednesday or we can do it the next week,'' Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to teacher funding, a number of other spending
issues have yet to be resolved. They include Clinton's request for
nearly $1 billion to pay off overdue U.S. financial obligations to
the United Nations, as well as $1.3 billion to help finance the
hiring of up to 50,000 local police officers. Clinton is demanding
nearly $500 million for the purchase of more public lands.
</P>
<P>
   But teacher funding is Clinton's top priority, and he pressed
that issue Monday during a White House event, where he unveiled a
new government study showing that the reduced class-size program
initiated in his administration in grades kindergarten through
third grade has helped improve student performance. The study also
reinforces other findings in independent studies that have also
shown that children who get more attention in smaller class often
perform better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over 1.7 million students are now directly benefiting from
this class-size initiative. It shows we are headed in the right
direction, and that's the good news,'' Clinton said. ``We have
mountain upon mountain of evidence that smaller classes in the
early grades lead to permanent learning gains if the teachers are
well-qualified.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on Republicans not to back down from the commitment
they made last year to the new teacher program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last fall, congressional Republicans agreed to support this
initiative. Indeed, it was election season, and they even went home
and campaigned on it. It was a good idea then, and it's still a
good idea,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   He accused Republicans of trying to turn his program into ``an
open-ended block grant'' that would allow local authorities to use
the money for private school voucher programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is wrong,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, however, insisted that the federal government should not
be able to dictate what local authorities do with the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know what the local needs are in Liberty,
Mississippi?'' he asked one reporter. ``I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged that local authorities should have
flexibility to use federal education money to address needs unique
to their communities. But he said money for hiring new teachers
should only go to communities that desperately need it for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want the money, they don't have to take it. If
they're offended by it, they can give it to other states and other
school districts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who heads the appropriations
subcommittee on education, called on Clinton to be a little more
flexible. He reminded Clinton that it is the job of Congress under
the Constitution to appropriate money and decide how it is
distributed, not the president's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we give up the power of the purse, which is at issue here,
it really reduces the Congress to being a eunuch,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Clinton has signed eight of the 13 annual appropriations
bills needed to fund the government. He and Congress have worked
out a deal on the ninth. But the remaining four measures account
for nearly half of the $618 billion budget for the 2000 fiscal
year. The remaining bills cover funding not only for education, but
for health, state, justice, commerce, interior and labor programs.

 &HT;    Nasdaq up more in wake of Microsoft ruling
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors shrugged off a potential Microsoft scare on Monday
with a broad-based rally among other technology stocks that sent
the Nasdaq composite index to its seventh straight record.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft's shares eventually rallied from early losses in
the first trading session since a federal judge found last Friday
that the world's largest software company is a monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had been concerned that a big sell-off of Microsoft
shares would depress the broader market, given the company's size
and also its recent addition to the Dow Jones industrial average.
</P>
<P>
   But after overnight losses in foreign markets and early declines
of as much as $7 per share on Wall Street, Microsoft ultimately
rebounded to end the regular session at $89.93 3/4, down only $1.62
1/2. Turnover was almost 122 million shares, or nearly five times
average daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors who abandoned Microsoft turned to the other
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``While (Microsoft CEO) Bill Gates is under the gun, his
competitors are dancing in the streets,'' said Prudential
Securities analyst Brian Piskorowski.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com rose $13.06 1/4 to $78, Yahoo gained $13.75 to
$197.18 3/4, and Cisco Systems rose $1.87 1/2 to $75.31 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   The net effect was to boost the technology-laden Nasdaq
composite by 41.68 points to 3,143.97, the index's eighth straight
gain and seventh straight record.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow and the S&AMP;P 500 stock index posted small gains.
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts defended Microsoft as an ongoing profit-maker.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst Brian Goodstadt reiterated his
``accumulate'' recommendation, pointing out that a final court
ruling is still months away, and the appeals process will take
several years beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he said, Microsoft shares will be propelled by strong
earnings growth, fueled by the February launch of its Windows 2000
system.
</P>
<P>
   At BB Robertson Stephens, analyst Marshall Senk reiterated a
``buy'' rating on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the still-upbeat U.S. economy continued to support
the market, especially after last Friday's October payroll report
indicating that wages are still under control despite a tight labor
market.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said this diminishes inflation fears and possibly
reduces the odds of another Federal Reserve interest rate boost
when it meets Nov. 16.
</P>
<P>
   Several reports due for release this week may shed more light,
especially the October producer, or wholesale, price index on
Wednesday and the October retail sales and third-quarter
productivity reports on Friday.

CHINA CONFIRMS SOME CULT MEMBERS DIED WHILE HELD IN DETENTION  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese officials Monday offered the first official
tally of the government crackdown on the banned Falun Gong
spiritual movement, saying 111 people had been formally arrested on
a variety of criminal charges, from disrupting state security to
stealing state secrets.
</P>
<P>
   But that figure does not include the much larger number of Falun
Gong members who face other forms of detention, ranging from
re-education programs to labor camps. The police have not yet
compiled nationwide statistics on those, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of those detained in Beijing in the last two
weeks were not arrested, said Li Bing, a spokesman for China's
cabinet, who spoke to a small number of foreign journalists at a
news conference. ``We just took them to a place for education and
returned them to their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Li said that perhaps 1,000 group members had converged on
Beijing in recent weeks to show their support for Falun Gong,
although a representative from his office later called reporters to
emphasize that this was only an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to estimate the size of the group, because more
than half of those who were sent home quickly returned to Beijing,
perhaps inflating the head count, said Qian Xiaoqian, another
official.
</P>
<P>
   The officials denied reports that any members had been beaten to
death while under arrest or in detention. They said that a handful
had died while in custody, but that they had either committed
suicide or died of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no beatings or inhumane treatment,'' Li said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily for the last two weeks, small groups of Falun Gong
members from out of town have been detained after sitting and
sometimes meditating in small acts of silent protest in Tiananmen
Square. A few said they had planned to deliver petitions to the
government legislators who were meeting nearby, but apparently they
did not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The popular movement, which blends traditional exercises with
Buddhism and Taoism as well as a dash of mystical beliefs, was
banned in July and has since been the subject of an extensive
vilification campaign in the state-controlled media, at state-owned
companies and on university campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The country's top leaders, who rarely speak out directly on
policy issues, have branded Falun Gong ``an evil sect,'' using
apocalyptic metaphors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Falun Gong problem is not a simple one,'' said President
Jiang Zemin, quoted in a new book, ``Falun Gong and Cults.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not underestimate it,'' he said, ``and even more so,
should not be gullible. If this problem is not swiftly solved, it
will become a major social disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese press and human rights groups outside China have
reported a succession of formal arrests in the last week, ever
since the government approved new laws dealing with cult activity.
</P>
<P>
   While some of those arrested, like a former police official, Li
Chang, were known to be leaders of the group, others were more
obscure. Zhang Ji, a student in Heilongjiang Province in the
northeast, was arrested for ``spreading information about Falun
Gong through the Internet,'' said the Information Center of Human
Rights and Democracy in China, a Hong Kong human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong members in China originally relied heavily on the
Internet to organize events and to keep in touch with practitioners
overseas, but the group's Web sites are now blocked in China.
</P>
<P>
   The group said it had millions of members in China before the
ban. It is not clear how many remain, although some followers are
still deeply committed. Many adherents said the exercises had
restored their health and given them spiritual peace at a time when
many Chinese feel left behind by the country's economic
transformation.
</P>
<P>
   But the government says 1,400 people have died as a result of
the anti-scientific bent of Falun Gong, which it said had prevented
members from seeking medical treatment. ``They have been sick and
not gone for treatment,'' Li said. ``Their families have asked us
to intercede.''
</P>
<P>
   He said at least one of the people who died while under police
supervision, Li Ruihua, 47, had a previous heart problem that had
been left untreated.
</P>
<P>
   Li said another follower, Chen Ying, 18, had committed suicide
by jumping from a train while being escorted back to her hometown
in Heilongjiang by officials from that area.
</P>
<P>
   A third follower, Zhao Jinghua, also had a previous heart
problem and died of a heart attack during her ``education'' period
near her home in the eastern province of Shandong, Li said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials did not say how many followers were still being
``educated'' or how long the process lasted, saying that it was
generally left in the hands of officials in the followers'
hometowns.

EXERCISE CAN BOOST BRAIN CAPACITY, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reading, 'riting, 'rithmetic. And running?
</P>
<P>
   Emerging new research in animals and humans suggests physical
exercise may boost brain function, improve mood and otherwise
increase learning, according to findings presented Monday at a
meeting of neuroscientists and educators.
</P>
<P>
   While it's too soon to conclude that children who don't exercise
fare worse in school, the research raises questions about the
recent national trend toward cutting physical education programs,
say some scientists and educators.
</P>
<P>
   Such cutbacks are ``a crime'' considering the new research
showing exercise's benefit to the brain by improving blood flow and
spurring cell growth, said Dr. John J. Ratey, clinical &UR;  &LR; associate
professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. Ratey presented
some of the latest findings at a Boston conference entitled
``Learning and the Brain.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey by the National Association for Sport and Physical
Education, the latest available, found that only one state _
Illinois _ mandates daily physical education for students in
kindergarten through 12th grades, even though federal guidelines
call for such regular activity.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts still has on the books a requirement that K-12
students participate in physical education, but the requirement
that a minimum amount of time be spent each week has been
eliminated, according to Joyce Tolken, past president of the
Massachusetts Association for Health, Physical Education,
Recreation and Dance.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day meeting drew about 2,000 neuroscientists and
educators from around the country to explore the potential for
brain research to reshape classroom practice.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the findings about physical exercise and brain
function, educators Monday learned what the latest animal research
is showing about the ability to grow new brain cells and what the
latest developmental psychology studies are revealing about how
young children learn. They also heard how to structure a classroom
to take advantage of the latest brain research findings.
</P>
<P>
   But the findings about physical activity and brain function
seemed the most intriguing, reflecting a growing understanding of
the brain's amazing ability to adapt and develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helpful to think of the brain as a muscle,'' said Ratey
to hundreds of people attending his session entitled ``The Care and
Feeding of the Brain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the best ways to maximize the brain is through
exercise, movement,'' Ratey said. ``Everybody feels better after
exercise. There's a reason for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ratey cited a variety of research in animals and humans, showing
how physical exercise increases cerebral blood flow and levels of a
brain-cell growth hormone. He also pointed to studies of exercise's
positive effect on mood-altering brain chemicals known as
neurotransmitters.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians are already starting to take advantage of some of
these findings in treating depressed patients. For instance, one
study of depressed cancer patients found that those who were
prescribed exercise saw a more than 40 percent drop in their scores
on tests measuring depression, according to Ratey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Exercise on its own can function for some people as an
antidepressant,'' Ratey said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Gould, a Princeton University neurobiologist who also
spoke at Monday's conference, cited research by California
scientists in mice showing that physical activity increases the
number of brain cells in the hippocampus, and that learning
improved with exercise.
</P>
<P>
   While her own animal research has not looked at the effect of
physical activity, it has shown that the growth of new brain cells
in the hippocampus increases with exposure to female sex hormones
and with learning, while it is slowed by exposure to stress
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   But Gould urged caution in using animal research as a basis for
educators to change classroom practice. ``I think what's
interesting from the perspective of education is that this is new
information about how the brain works, and it also gives us a sense
of how the brain is structurally changing throughout life.''
</P>
<P>
   Physical education teachers like Jean Blaydes of Richardson,
Texas, and Tolken, who heads up the program at Wellesley public
schools, say they are convinced by the research so far and their
own experience of the importance of exercise to schoolchildren.
Physical activity adds to the children's overall education and
keeps them from becoming obese as so many children and adults are
in this country, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet we are cutting physical education programs left and
right,'' said Blaydes, an elementary school physical education
teacher who attended Ratey's talk. The research suggests that
exercise ``seems to be really important in the learning process,''
she said, yet physical education programs are often ``considered
fluff.''
</P>
<P>
   Tolken, who was not at the conference but is aware of the
scientific findings and concerned about the general trend toward
cutting physical education programs, said, ``What we're doing in
the schools, I think, flies in the face of research.''

BRADLEY ATTACKS GORE ON HEALTH CARE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also HEALTHCARE-INSURE) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley issued his strongest critique
yet of Vice President Al Gore on Monday, asserting that Gore had
fallen prey to what he called the incremental mentality of
Washington and had betrayed a fundamental Democratic Party
principle by not pushing for universal health care as a candidate
for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the case of health care, Al Gore decided it wasn't worth
standing and fighting,'' Bradley said in a speech before 6,000
health care professionals, bluntly throwing Gore's own words back
at him. The Gore campaign has accused Bradley of failing to ``stand
and fight'' for the Democratic Party when he retired from Congress
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are locked in an increasingly tight battle for the
Democratic presidential nomination, and in recent weeks Gore has
been aggressively attacking Bradley on a range of issues, from his
record as a three-term senator to his plan for making health
insurance available to almost all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday, Bradley had sought to avoid responding directly to
Gore's criticisms, contending that American voters were tired of
negative campaigning and hungry for positive ideas from their
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, he clearly diverged from that strategy, using his
most forceful language to date to describe Gore as lacking the
vision and the confidence of his convictions to fight for a plan
that would cover the nation's 44 million uninsured people.
</P>
<P>
   ``He abandoned that fundamental Democratic principle of basic
health care for all Americans he had talked about so much in the
campaign of 1992 and during the first two years of the
administration,'' Bradley said, reading from a prepared text with
his usual calm tone.
</P>
<P>
   To emphasize that point, Bradley's press office released a list
of statements by Gore in 1992 and 1994 strongly endorsing universal
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, Gore's spokesman, responded to the speech by
saying that Bradley ``acted today like a typical politician.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unable to defend the merits of his own health care plan, he
launched a negative attack on Al Gore,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that the downfall of President Clinton's universal
health care plan in 1994 had made Gore fearful of proposing a
sweeping plan today, even though, he asserted, the public is more
eager for one than ever and the federal budget is flush enough to
pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson Al Gore learned from the health care defeat was
that big bold things can't get done in Washington, so let's look to
the small, symbolic things,'' Bradley said. ``But that was the
wrong lesson. Indeed, big rhetoric followed by small actions
contributes to the disillusionment people have with politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a former professional basketball player who has tried
to cast himself as a populist outsider running ``a different kind
of campaign,'' also accused Gore of being a captive of Washington,
cowed and myopic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe something happens when you listen to Washington voices,
instead of the people's,'' Bradley said. ``The Washington view of
things says, `Don't propose anything bold in a campaign because
your opponent will surely pick it apart.' The Beltway perspective
says that if you try something once and fail, move on to another
issue that polls better or is safer to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued by his campaign, Gore defended the
proposal, saying, ``I have put forward a plan that offers health
insurance to every child, covers nearly 90 percent of all Americans
and does so while strengthening Medicare, preserving Medicaid and
focusing on those who lack coverage today.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has called for federal subsidies and tax credits to
enable lower income people to buy private health insurance. He
contends that his plan would cost $650 billion over 10 years, to be
paid out of a $1 trillion federal surplus, and would make insurance
available to 95 percent of all Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign asserts that Bradley's plan would cover fewer
people than Bradley claims and cost $1 trillion over 10 years,
eating up the entire non-Social Security surplus and leaving
nothing for shoring up the Medicare system or other social
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's own plan focuses more on poor children and the elderly.
The vice president's aides contend his proposal would extend
coverage to almost as many uninsured people as Bradley's, while
costing much less: between $300 billion and $400 billion over a
decade. To bolster his contention, Gore's aides released a report
on Monday by Dr. Ken Thorpe, a former Clinton health adviser now on
the faculty of Emory University, saying that Bradley's plan would
cover 89 percent of the population, compared with 88 percent under
the Gore plan.

<P>
   Bradley's aides said he was simply trying to use his speech to
point out clear distinctions between himself and Gore, and had
refrained from using the kinds of pejorative words or scare tactics
they claim the Gore camp has employed.
</P>
<P>
   But they acknowledged that Bradley had put more muscle into his
speech on Monday because of Gore's recent attacks, and said he was
likely to continue responding more aggressively in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley gave his 25-minute speech in a cavernous convention hall
on the shores of Lake Michigan filled with members of the American
Public Health Association who repeatedly interrupted him with
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the event said that Gore was also asked to speak
but had turned down the invitation because of a scheduling
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the speech, which received a standing ovation, the
association's executive director, Dr. Mohammad Akhter, praised
Bradley for having the ``courage, wisdom and foresight'' to make
health care a major part of his platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time a presidential candidate spoke here, it was
Jimmy Carter,'' Akhter told the crowd. ``Maybe history might repeat
itself.''

<P>
   MONTE DOURADO, Brazil _ Two decades ago, the American
billionaire Daniel Ludwig took a bold but very expensive gamble
here. After buying a piece of the Amazon jungle larger than the
state of Connecticut, the shipping magnate spent a large chunk of
his fortune building an industrial, mining and agricultural complex
that he imagined would prosper as a result of the world's growing
appetite for products like paper, aluminum, porcelain, rice, beef
and pork.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jari Celulose, as a scaled-down version of the project is
known, is for sale, available to any bidder _ for $1. Better yet,
the current owners, a Brazilian consortium that has seen only one
profitable year since taking over after Ludwig gave up in 1982, may
even throw in a bonus of up to $20 million to the buyer who will
take the venture off their hands.
</P>
<P>
   There is a catch to the largely symbolic sale price, of course.
Jari comes with $354 million in debt, its attractive bauxite and
clay mines have already been spun off, and the project will require
several hundred million dollars in new investment, including $100
million to build an electric power plant, if it is to continue to
manufacture high-quality cellulose, the fiber used to make paper.
</P>
<P>
   Like the China market, the notion that there are unlimited
riches to be had from the Amazon is one of those dreams that never
seem to die. Since the first Spanish colonizers in the New World
fell under the spell of the legend of El Dorado, adventurers have
arrived with the conviction they can build empires in places such
as this, only to run afoul of one of the most hostile natural and
business environments on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Jari may be an object lesson in such hazards, but it has fared
better than most previous efforts, such as Fordlandia, Henry Ford's
failed effort to grow rubber 200 miles southwest of here. More than
30 years after Ludwig bought 6,301 square miles of inhospitable
jungle for $3.1 million, the project is still a going concern and
remains the focus of controversy and a symbol of both sovereignty
and tenacity.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, Ludwig invited scrutiny by thinking in grandiose
terms.
</P>
<P>
   When construction of a 17-story paper mill and power plant on
the site he had selected proved impossible, he spent more than $269
million to have them built at his favorite shipyard in Japan and
then towed 17,800 miles across the Indian and Atlantic oceans.
</P>
<P>
   He also installed 3,000 miles of road, 37 miles of railway, a
deep-water port and a company town that now has 9,500 inhabitants.
More than 260,000 acres were planted with Burmese melina and
Caribbean pine trees, which did not flourish in this harsh
equatorial climate, and eventually, after much costly
experimentation, eucalyptus, which did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always wanted to plant rows of trees like corn,'' Ludwig,
who died in 1992 at the age of 95, said in a rare interview,
published in 1980 in National Geographic magazine.
</P>
<P>
   But the very scale of Ludwig's ambitions aroused suspicion among
Brazilians, who have been distrustful of any foreign presence in
the Amazon since the British destroyed their rubber industry a
century ago by spiriting seeds away to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Books with titles like ``Jari: The American Invasion,'' and
press reports suggested that Ludwig was creating his own nation
with its own armed forces, using slave labor, destroying the jungle
and smuggling gold abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Though Brazilians are taught in school that the Amazon is a
natural wonder, and can recite the names of the river's tributaries
with ease, relatively few from the big cities 1,500 miles to the
south have ever set foot in the region or have a desire to visit.
This distance fuels nationalistic slogans like ``The Amazon is
ours,'' but produces very little knowledge of or sympathy for the
obstacles faced by any undertaking in the jungle.
</P>
<P>
   In part because Brazilians regard the Amazon as a place of quick
and easy riches, ``the state has not played its proper role'' in
the region, said Erton Sesquim Sanchez, Jari's current operations
director. ``They have not come in to build schools and basic sewage
systems, pave roads, install electric power. We're here 20 years,
and we still have to confront ourselves those and other problems
that are really the responsibility of the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the social role that companies like Jari are forced to
play, calls for these companies to be expelled persist today. The
October edition of ``Amazon Agenda,'' a monthly newsletter
published by Lucio Flavio Pinto, author of a critical history of
Jari and the region's best-known investigative reporter, describes
Jari and projects like it as ``Trojan horses in the Amazon'' that
enrich foreigners at the expense of ordinary Brazilians.
</P>
<P>
   In Ludwig's case, after he could not get government approval for
a dam he wanted and walked away from Jari, the nationalists got
their wish, though not quite in the form they had anticipated.
Since the early 1980s, two government-owned banks, the National
Bank for Economic and Social Development and Banco do Brasil, have
poured at least $350 million into the effort to keep Jari going and
together now hold a one-third stake in the cellulose project.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the goals originally envisioned by Ludwig have
also been pared down. Plans to raise cattle and pigs were shelved.
A project to grow rice along the banks of the Amazon River,
intended to turn Brazil into a rice exporter, was abandoned. That
area has since been turned over to an entrepreneur who is now
trying to turn it into a fish farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus these days is immensely different from what it was
back in those early days,'' said Jose Ricardo Cordeiro, president
of Jarcel Celulose, the project's holding company. ``Before,
everything was on a large scale. But we are aware we are not a big
company, that Jari will never be the mega-enterprise it was
projected to be, and we act accordingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the process has come full circle: Jari's current
owners are once again actively seeking a foreign partner. ``We are
in a global market, and so there are no restrictions,'' Sanchez
said during an interview at his office at the paper mill. ``The
most important thing is not the origin of the capital, but the
capacity to carry this undertaking ahead.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Israel Coslovsky, chairman of Jari's board of directors, said in
an interview in Rio de Janeiro that preliminary talks with an
American and a Canadian company, which he declined to identify, are
already under way. But Brazilian market analysts are skeptical of
the company's ability to attract significant foreign or domestic
investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jari is the ugly duckling of the paper industry, a project in
which no serious player has an interest,'' said Thomas Mello Souza,
who follows the Brazil pulp and steel industries for Merrill
Lynch's office in Sao Paulo. ``Despite being close to the American
and European markets, it is in an isolated area of difficult
access, and that complicates the operation of the business, adds to
operational costs and makes for a very high turnover.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Jari's cash flow is now positive, to expand and modernize
its plant for an increasingly finicky international market will
require an additional $400 million in investment, Souza estimated.
``They are looking for a white knight, but I think it is a mission
impossible,'' he said, ``especially at a time when there are
properties in Brazil that are more attractive, with better
economies of scale, and which can't find buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslovsky and Cordeiro, however, argue that the company has
turned the corner. Production is at 295,000 tons of cellulose this
year, two-thirds exported to Europe and another 10 percent to North
America. Production is expected to rise to 330,000 tons next year.
The price of Jari-made pulp has also risen, from $320 a ton in 1998
to $580 this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time, I am optimistic'' Coslovsky said. ``Two
years ago we had not 1 cent of working capital'' after a fire that
forced the project to shut down for several months, but
``conditions today have never been more propitious than in the
entire history of Jari, with a market that is stable and a
government that has shown good will to resolve our problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Jari's debt, 70 percent of it in dollars, is owed to nearly a
score of Brazilian and foreign banks, including, Coslovsky said,
Citibank, a unit of Citigroup, and J.P. Morgan. But the 40 percent
devaluation of Brazil's currency, the real, this year has had
minimal effect on the company for two reasons: Jari earns dollars
exporting its products, and ``the debt was unpayable before, and it
is unpayable now,'' as Sanchez put it.
</P>
<P>
   Though some nationalist groups have argued that Jari should
simply be closed, that seems unlikely, since the social and
political cost to the Brazilian government would be so high. Though
the project itself has only 1,050 employees, more than 70,000
people now live here or in ramshackle communities along the Jari
River, and would be left without a livelihood if strictly economic
logic were applied.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy of this entire region revolves around the Jari
projects,'' Joao Firmino Rafael, manager of the local branch of
Hongkong Shanghai Banking Corp., said, referring to the cellulose,
bauxite and kaolin plants as a whole. ``They can't shut down. If
they were to do that, a lot of other businesses would have to close
too, and we would have no reason to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the center of this tidy little town, named ``Gilded
Mountain'' in Portuguese, the simple wooden house where Ludwig
stayed during his frequent visits here in the 1970s is now a museum
that describes him as a visionary. The museum and a similar display
at the pulp mill offer plenty of data about the history and
functioning of the project, but make no explicit mention of the
main lesson to be learned from Jari's experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Amazon has advantages but it also has disadvantages,''
Coslovsky said. ``You have to be very much aware of them before you
do anything in the region.''

RULING PARTY STRENGTHENED BY PRIMARY VOTE, OBSERVERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's ruling party appeared Monday to have
weathered, even thrived on, its biggest experiment in letting
voters _ rather than the party elite _ choose its standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI)
allayed fears that a break from its authoritarian past would cause
it to splinter in the heat of a primary campaign, which ended with
the runner-up throwing his support behind winner Francisco
Labastida Ochoa in a conciliatory concession speech.
</P>
<P>
   For both of these reasons, the party and Labastida, a former
interior minister, are now considered the odds-on favorites to win
the presidency in the crucial July 2000 general elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an enormous show of force by the PRI,'' said Sergio
Aguayo Quesada, a political scientist at the Colegio de Mexico.
``At this moment this party clearly has the momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   After even the most optimistic PRI officials predicted that
about 6 million Mexico voters would cast ballots, the actual
turnout _ according to party figures _ was more than 8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than leaving the party fractured in a close vote, as some
party insiders feared, voters handed a landslide victory to
Labastida, who won 272 of the country's 300 districts.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of creating deeper internal divisions or leaving the
party in protest, as some observers had expected, all of the
candidates immediately accepted the outcome and pledged to stay
with the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will keep working from within to make the changes (we
want),'' said Roberto Madrazo Pintado, governor of Tabasco state
who was Labastida's closest and most bitter rival.
</P>
<P>
   Although some analysts wondered whether Madrazo might yet leave
the party in protest against a process that he publicly criticized
as tilted toward Labastida, there were smiles and sighs of relief
at party headquarters in downtown Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's election marked the first time in its 70-year history
that Mexico's dominant political party allowed voters to choose its
presidential candidate rather than having the sitting president
pick his successor. Even so, the election and the campaign were
dogged by constant accusations that the PRI machine was engineering
a victory for Labastida because he was the choice of outgoing
President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   In the final weeks, Zedillo, who decided last spring to abandon
the practice of anointing a successor, made repeated statements
stressing his neutrality. In a nationally televised address after
the polls closed Sunday, the president revealed that he nullified
his own ballot by marking a vote for each of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's candidacy will be made official at a ceremony on
Nov. 20, the holiday celebrating the 1910-1920 Mexican revolution.
For the 57-year-old former governor of Sinaloa state and three-time
cabinet minister, the climb to the top of Mexico's political
establishment has been quick and steep.
</P>
<P>
   Only five years ago, as the ambassador of Portugal, Labastida's
political future was cloudy. But he was brought back to Mexico City
and made his way up the bureaucracy, from federal highway chief to
agriculture secretary and then to interior minister, a post similar
to that of vice president in the United States, which he quit in
June to mount his run for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only began thinking about running for president late last
year when I started hearing my name mentioned on radio and TV,''
Labastida said last weekend. ``This isn't something I've wanted to
do since I was a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, many observers think Labastida closely mirrors
Zedillo's technocratic, free-market policies. But toward the end of
the campaign, he distanced himself from administration policies,
probably in an effort to attract support from the populist wings of
the PRI that have become disenchanted with Mexico's current
generation of Ivy League-trained policymakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Labastida is a game player,'' said Jaime Gonzalez Graff, a
sociologist at the Mexican Institute of Political Studies. ``He
isn't isn't completely technocratic but not entirely populist
either.''
</P>
<P>
   The open question is whether the PRI's new democratic face will
be enough of a change to keep most of Mexico's 58 million voters
from looking for something different in other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's two main opponents will be former Guanajuato state
governor Vicente Fox Quesada, candidate of the conservative
National Action Party, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, son of a beloved
president, former mayor of Mexico City, and the candidate of a
leftist coalition led by the Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the opposition has begun to poke fun at the PRI's new
image of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``I congratulate the 50 million Mexicans who didn't vote in
Sunday's primary,'' Fox told reporters Monday. ``I applaud them for
not falling for the PRI's greatest hoax.''

 &HT;    Dell to set up another Tennessee plant
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Three months after Dell Computer Corp. opened a
manufacturing plant in Tennessee _ its first U.S. factory outside
of Central Texas _ it announced Monday a second assembly plant in
Nashville, where it is building a regional campus.
</P>
<P>
   When it opens next year, the plant on 150 city-owned acres near
the Nashville airport will add nearly 700 jobs to Dell's Middle
Tennessee work force. Dell has been assembling its Dimension
desktop PCs in leased space 25 miles east of Nashville since early
August.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's Middle Tennessee payroll already includes more than 1,300
workers at the leased site, which Dell executives say will continue
to operate when the new manufacturing plant opens next year.
Another 400 customer-support workers are in leased space in
Nashville, awaiting completion of a 300,000-square-foot office
building at the airport site.
</P>
<P>
   The new manufacturing building, at 300,000 square feet, will be
about the same size as Dell's newer plants in Central Texas. Also
planned for the campus is a 200,000-square-foot customer-support
center. .
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee operations are still small compared with Dell's
presence in Central Texas, where it has more than 20,000 workers.
But the plans for the additional plant is an indication that the
nation's biggest computer maker is happy with its move there last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dell executives said Nashville reminded them of
Austin, with its large college population, state capital and music
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Moving operations to the Nashville area also limits the
company's dependence on Central Texas, where the work force and
roads have been taxed by the economic boom and population growth of
the 1990s. Strategically, Nashville's location near hubs of Federal
Express and other deliver companies cuts the time it takes to
deliver PCs to East Coast customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are putting the capacity where it makes the most sense to
support the consumer and the small business lines of our
business,'' Dell spokeswoman Cathie Hargett said Monday. ``This is
about managing our growth in a way that is good for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Dell, like their counterparts at many growing
companies, are concerned about Austin's tight labor force and
worsening traffic congestion. But the company, which releases
third-quarter results after the financial markets close on
Thursday, will continue to expand in Central Texas, Hargett said.
</P>
<P>
   Dell said this summer that it expected its Nashville operations
to employ at least 3,000 people in five years. Adding salaries,
construction costs and local purchases, Dell estimated its
investment in Middle Tennessee will be about $340 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making good on our pledge to the people of Tennessee,''
Michael Dell, the company's chairman and chief executive officer,
said in announcing the expansion in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Dell's expansion into Tennessee has been somewhat controversial
in that state. Critics complained that the promised new jobs did
not justify a 40-year property-tax exemption and other incentives
that government leaders guaranteed the company.
</P>
<P>
   The package, which also includes an inexpensive lease of public
land where the campus will be built, is estimated to be worth about
$50 million during the 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Dell opened a leased manufacturing, sales and
customer-support facility in southeast Brazil. There, Dell plans to
build a campus valued at $120 million, including about $20 million
in government incentives.

PARIS PUTS ITS FOOT DOWN AND BEGINS CAMPAIGN TO ENCOURAGE CURBING

<P>
   PARIS _ The young woman in the White Sox cap would give her name
only as Sophie. Her golden lab would go by Mellis. No last names,
please.
</P>
<P>
   Mellis, luckily for her, was too excited by all the attention to
commit the crime the two had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Their mistake was to stroll down the Passage des Marais, a quiet
pedestrian alley, just as an anti-dog-poop demonstration was at its
height. The demonstrators drew chalk circles around the piles, sang
anti-doggie ditties, and repelled dog owners by offering them
chocolate versions of what they had planned to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Since there were as many journalists as demonstrators about, the
two ladies were quickly mobbed. ``Not everyone in Paris is dirty,''
pleaded Sophie. ``But it's difficult for Mellis to go between two
cars. We need someplace especially for dogs.''
</P>
<P>
   How about, she was asked, just picking it up, as the citizens of
other great metropolises do? ``Oh, well _ maybe if the city
provided plastic bags,'' she said, unenthusiastically. ``And
perhaps the city could teach the correct way to use them.''
</P>
<P>
   As always in Paris, it is the government's fault.
</P>
<P>
   Dog waste, says Le Figaro, ``sticks to Paris' reputation the way
fog does to London's.'' Tourists are revolted at what they find
underfoot as they gaze overhead. An average of 650 people a year
break bones or are hospitalized after slipping in it.
</P>
<P>
   In a Harris poll of neighborhood cleanliness, 94 percent of
Parisians polled said they considered it the most offensive aspect
of public litter. It is amazing that it has never been named as a
secret factor in Princess Diana's death.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as it has done periodically, the city is trying to do
something about the problem. It has begun a poster and movie-short
campaign hoping to awaken the average Parisian's sense of guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known movie short follows a blind man cheerfully
navigating city streets. When he gets home and hangs up his white
cane, the camera lingers nauseatingly on what he has speared en
brochette. One poster shows a person in a wheelchair who has just
run through a pile and is about to put her hand in the mess on her
wheel. A third shows a boy playing in the grass with filth-covered
toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're right not to pick it up,'' the campaign motto says to
dog owners. ``They do it very well for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, since the campaign began Sept. 30, there has been no
rush by apologetic Parisians to mend their ways.
</P>
<P>
   The city calculates that its 200,000 resident dogs deposit 16
tons of waste a day, of which the city cleans up 12 tons, at a cost
that works out to about a dollar a pound. Much of the work is done
by 70 green ``caninette'' motorcycles with vacuum cleaners
attached, but that is too few, and some are sidelined in a contract
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The city _ in the person of Patrick Tremege, adjunct mayor for
environmental matters and the force behind the ad campaign _ knows
perfectly well that asking politely is not enough.
</P>
<P>
   Tremege has the experience to understand that the stick works
better than the doggie treat. In 1974, as a 21-year-old student, he
left the island of Madagascar, a French colony where his parents
owned whole fields of fragrant ylang-ylang perfume-oil trees.
Without even a stop in Paris, he flew to New York to take an
internship. There, he became a dog walker for diplomats _ three
mutts four times a day, up and down First Avenue in front of the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   He fondly remembers the long, clean, effective American
pooper-scoop he owned back then. He says he has filled his office
here with French engineers trying to re-create the design.
(France's New York consulate has been unable to find its equal, he
swears.)
</P>
<P>
   He also remembers the night he got lazy. ``It was 8 p.m., it was
winter, it was dark,'' he said. ``One of the dogs did it, and this
police car turned around, and put on its lights. Woo-woo! You don't
know Madagascar, but I'd never seen a police car with a siren, and
I was terrified. I just liquefied.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was convinced they were going to shoot me. I don't even know
what the policeman said _ I didn't have much English and I was
watching his hands to see if he would go for his gun. In the end,
he could see I was a foreigner paralyzed by fear, and he let me
go.''
</P>
<P>
   Fearful is more or less how he wants Parisians to feel. But even
he, an adjunct mayor, says it is the government's fault.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, he explains, it is because Paris is the national
capital, and the mayor has no real control over the police,
traffic, parking, or public sanitation. The national police are
legally responsible, ``but French police have a very high idea of
what their duties are, and they think this is beneath them,'' he
complained. ``They give out only six tickets a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, local law only requires dog owners to urge their
dogs into the gutter, not to pick up after them. Parisians also
routinely ignore the leash law, allowing them to use the old
``My-goodness-whose-bad-dog-is-doing-that-way-over-there?'' trick.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated, Tremege shifted 50 of his park custodians to dog
patrol.
</P>
<P>
   But Benoit Pastisson, an organizer of the Passage des Marais
demonstration, complains that even those 50 lonely and resented
souls work 9 to 5 while dog owners creep the streets before dawn
and after the late movie.
</P>
<P>
   Tremege says the real problem is that his men have no legal
power to demand identification or make arrests. ``Some people don't
know that, because they handed out 900 tickets this year,'' he
said. ``But if you say `no,' there's nothing they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Why, the two men were asked, are Parisians so uncooperative
about this? Pastisson answers with a shocking lack of jingoism:
``Anglo-Saxons are more civilized people _ just look at how they
wait at traffic lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Tremege throws up his hands. In Paris, there are more old people
living with dogs per capita than in any other big city, he said
(and they vote, which is why the law is so lax). Beyond that, ``How
can I explain?'' he said. ``French people are made in such a way so
that seeing it in the street is not as shocking as it is to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, he said, he will ask Parliament to give his park
workers the power to arrest. Until then, Parisians will have to
watch their step.

NAVY RETURNS TO SITE WHERE BLACK BOXES WERE DETECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS AND BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ As strong winds churning waves up to 20 feet
high slowly abated, the Navy returned Monday to the crash site of
EgyptAir Fight 990 off Nantucket and launched a second high-tech
drone to search for the black boxes of the doomed jet, while FBI
agents waited on a command ship to search for any telltale signs of
explosives.
</P>
<P>
   The Magnum, a more advanced, remote-controlled submarine, was
sent to the ocean floor shortly after 4 p.m. from its mother ship,
the Carolyn Chouest. The USS Grapple, with another drone on board,
left safe harbor here and was expected to join in the hunt by early
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing, US Navy Rear Adm. William Sutton said he expects
the two remote vehicles to continue working through Wednesday, when
more rough weather is forecast to move through the region.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking every advantage and maximizing every
opportunity,'' Sutton said. ``The weather has been driving the pace
of the investigation and will continue to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as broken-hearted family members began to leave Rhode
Island with few answers about the crash, state Attorney General
Sheldon Whitehouse filed a request for presumptive death
certificates for everyone on board. The documents will enable them
to attend to legal matters regarding their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   During the briefing, National Transportation Safety Board
chairman James E. Hall seemed to bristle at the suggestion that the
federal government was not bringing all its resources to bear on
finding out why the Boeing 767-ER300, bound for Cairo from New York
City, mysteriously plunged into the Atlantic Ocean Oct. 31, killing
all 217 on board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are committed to finding the answer to the cause of the
accident of EgyptAir Flight 990,'' said Hall. ``I am confident we
will find the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Mawn, FBI special agent in charge of the New England
division, said that there was no indication that the plane was
downed by a criminal act. About 20 agents were at sea waiting to
test and catalogue wreckage as possible evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In a bizarre twist, however, Mawn said agents had arrested a
Hyde Park, Mass., man for phoning in eight separate bomb threats to
Northwest Airlines from mid-October to Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Pedro Antonio Castillo-Ferrer, 33, made statements
that he was working on behalf of FARC, an armed Colombian
revolutionary force, and claimed the group was responsible for the
EgyptAir crash.
</P>
<P>
   However, ``we are very comfortable that he had nothing to do
with it,'' Mawn said.
</P>
<P>
   NTSB investigator in charge Gregory Phillips said US personnel
have arrived in Cairo to begin reviewing the maintenance history of
the ill-fated jet.
</P>
<P>
   So far, he said, crews have recovered only small, light pieces
of debris, such as aircraft seat cushions and tires from the nose
landing gear.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said the NTSB was aware of a recent report that two
bolts on the tail of another Boeing 767 were not tightened to the
appropriate specifications, and that investigators would closely
examine the tail of the EgyptAir jetliner.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing checked all 767s in production and found that eight
planes also had loose bolts. The aircraft manufacturing giant is
expected to notify all airlines currently flying the 767 later this
week of the potential problem. A spokeswoman said that, as a safety
measure, the plane is designed with 16 bolts on the tail _ many
more than are necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators also have about 10 hours of high-quality videotape
from the Deep Drone on the Grapple that reveals the complete
devastation of the airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``The visibility is very limited, but very clearly you can
identify aircrft wreckage,'' said Phillips. ``I can only say it is
very fragmented.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wreckage is stacked in piles several feet high.
</P>
<P>
   Though search crews located the pingers _ signals that are
designed to guide investigators to the jet's ``black boxes,''
flight data and cockpit voice recorders _ last week, they are
believed to be buried under debris and possibly the silty ocean
bottom, about 250 feet below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Admiral Sutton said Monday that the jagged edges of the aircraft
wreckage, the water's depth and the churning surface prevent divers
from safely searching for the devices, which could contain vital
clues.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said there were two main debris fields that side-scan sonar
has mapped so far in a six-mile by six-mile area, some 60 miles
south of Nantucket. The pingers are in the eastern debris field.

`hV2k' HACKER HITS TEXAS AGENCIES 
 
(Attn: Calif., Nev., N.Y., Va. and Wash.) 
 
By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
and CLAY ROBISON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A hacker, who has struck government Web sites
around the nation and even a federal department, targeted six Texas
agencies over the weekend, chastising them for poor security.
</P>
<P>
   The hacker, using the tag ``hV2k,'' left graffiti on the state
Web sites expressing everything from disgust to annoyance to
boredom. While early reports said as many as a dozen agency Web
sites were breached, only six were confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Texas agencies received alerts and advice on how to
tighten their security, and the Texas Department of Public Safety's
high-tech crimes unit began an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The hacker did not breach the privacy of sensitive state records
or the security of state tax dollars, officials reported. He did,
however, manage to hack the DPS Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigators are still conducting a criminal
investigation and I would expect it to go on for a while,'' said
DPS spokeswoman Tela Mange.
</P>
<P>
   Also hit were the Texas Department of Health, Texas Protective
and Regulatory Services, Alcoholic Beverage Commission, State
Auditor's Office and the Department of Licensing and Regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``gAH. after defacing this site, i think i will try to get my
drivers license again for the 3rd time. .sigh, '' the hacker wrote
at the Department of Licensing and Regulation's page. ``Learn
sekurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hacking as a form of graffiti is not that difficult if ``that's
how you spend your whole life,'' said Steven Wilkins, the agency's
director of information resources. It does, however, consume
considerable time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't identify with that mentality. Also, we don't issue
drivers' licenses,'' he added. ``We license auctioneers, boxers,
air-conditioning contractors. . .''
</P>
<P>
   Agencies said the hacking did alert them of weaknesses in their
systems, which are under repair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken the action to notify all agencies that they
could be targets,'' said Carolyn Purcell, executive director of the
Department of Information Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like them to know how to preclude it in the future. .
.but meanwhile to put them on the alert to look out for it so they
can remedy it as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The state government Web sites that were attacked around
midnight Sunday all use the Microsoft Windows NT Internet
Information Server. That program has been wracked by security
troubles in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   At the state auditor's Web site, the hacker complained, ``this
is getting boring, SEKURE YER DAMN NABIT NT SYTEMS.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Health was told it had been turned into
the ``Texas Department of Hacked.'' The department isn't exactly
amused, said spokesman Doug McBride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say they're the sharpest pencil in the box,'' he
said of the hacker. ``It may be a prank, it may be a joke, but
we're asking that it be taken seriously because it is a violation
of state and federal laws.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services took
offense as well. Under a drawing of an elderly woman kissing the
cheek of her companion, the hacker wrote ``woah. .those are some
pretty damn ugly faces above'' and indicated that's why the site
was hacked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like more of an embarrassment. I think it's a shame
they targeted a state agency whose purpose is to help abused and
neglected children and vulnerable adults,'' said spokeswoman Marla
Sheely.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites that track hackers' movements _ www.attrition.org and
www.2600.com _ noted the attacks on Texas agencies Monday and
indicated the hacker responsible had been particularly active. Web
pages also vandalized by ``hV2k'' include Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corp., a federal government agency, and government Web sites in
California, Nevada, New York, Virginia and Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the nature of the hacking and the damages
resulting, penalties under Texas law can range from a Class B
misdemeanor to a felony carrying prison time, said Mange at the
DPS. She said, for now at least, the FBI has not been brought into
the case.

BP AMOCO HAS 72 PERCENT RISE IN PROFITS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Bolstered by higher oil prices and deep reductions in
costs, BP Amoco on Monday announced a 72 percent rise in third
quarter profits and forecast higher gains next year from its
planned $33.6-billion purchase of ARCO.
</P>
<P>
   The increase pushed BP Amoco's stock up 4.5 percent, to 565.5
pence, or about $9.16, maintaining strong gains that have increased
the company's share price by 29 percent this year, ahead of two
larger rivals, Royal Dutch/Shell and Exxon.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that profits from operations rose to $1.96
billion compared with $1.14 billion in the similar period in 1998.
The results partly reflected the effects of a restructuring plan
announced last July aimed at cutting annual costs by $4 billion, as
well as the effect of higher oil prices.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco said the average price of oil rose from $11.59 a barrel
in the 1998 third quarter to $19.17 in the third quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This continuing performance improvement will underpin further
growth in the business, assuming a continuation of firm aggregate
demand,'' said Sir John Browne, the company's chief executive.
``Additional potential will arise next year from the ARCO
acquisition.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase had been held up by objections from Alaskan
authorities who were concerned that the resulting oil giant would
be in an overwhelmingly strong position there. But last Friday, the
company struck a deal with the Alaskan authorities to sell some
assets and thereby reduce its dominance.

</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feinstein Kean Partners Inc., the largest Boston-area public
relations and consulting firm specializing in startup biotechnology
companies, Monday said it has been bought by Ogilvy Public
Relations Worldwide of New York, the nation's 10th largest public
relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms were not disclosed, aside from a statement that
the five Feinstein Kean owner-partners, led by chief executive
Peter Feinstein, will receive payouts over several years based on
the Cambridge firm's performance.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is the latest in an industry consolidation wave that
has turned several of the Boston area's best-known advertising and
public relations companies into subsidiaries of larger
conglomerates. The list includes Hill Holliday Connors Cosmopulos,
Mullen, Arnold Communications, Weber Group, and, last month,
McDermott/O'Neill &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy Public Relations itself is a subsidiary of WPP Group plc,
based in London. WPP also owns the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide and J.
Walter Thompson advertising agencies, and Hill and Knowlton, the
world's second largest public relations firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Feinstein Kean acquisition will allow Ogilvy Public
Relations to expand its health care public-relations practice to
biotechnology. Ogilvy has renamed the company Feinstein Kean
Healthcare and is operating it and its business-development and
consulting unit, Kendall Strategies, as a wholly owned subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein Kean and Kendall Strategies together have 75 employees
and had more than $9 million in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ogilvy said the acquisition will boost its annual revenue from
public relations services for pharmaceutical and other health care
companies to more than $32 million. The company had $79 million in
revenue from all operations last year and is projecting 1999
revenue at about $120 million.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Ogilvy Public Relations' president and chief
executive, Robert Seltzer, said Feinstein Kean's ``strength in
helping biotech companies through the early stages of their
existence meshes perfectly with both our pharmaceutical expertise
and our strength in corporate communications.''

   Feinstein Kean was formed in 1987 by Feinstein and Robert
Gottleib, both of whom worked for Biogen Inc. Its client list
includes Aquila Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Cambridge Neuroscience
Inc., Immunogen Inc., and SafeScience Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said the sale was prompted by market opportunity and a
chance to gain international presence. ``We were facing a bit of a
hurdle that we needed to overcome, as a local company that could
bid on small companies but did not have the capabilities for large
biopharmaceutial product launches,'' he said.

   Feinstein said Ogilvy can provide these, along with the depth of
staff needed to serve the emerging, related field of genomics, in
which genetic information will be the basis for development of new

   Feinstein Kean is the second US public relations agency bought
this year by Ogilvy, which two weeks ago aquired BWR Inc. of Los

 &HT;    Read of the week on yoga
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Yoga Journal's Yoga Basics: The Essential Beginner's Guide
to Yoga for a Lifetime of Health and Fitness'' by Mara Carrico and
Yoga Journal (Henry Holt, 1997, $15.95 paperback).
</P>
<P>
   Gives the basics of all different styles of yoga and takes the
reader through basic postures. The history and philosophy of yoga
are accessible to the greenest beginner, and the photos and
descriptions of poses make for easy-to-follow replication. Author
Mara Carrico has 25 years' experience instructing hatha yoga, and
she begins the book with an exploration of the roots of the various
hatha yoga styles
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Yoga: The Spirit and Practice of Moving into Stillness'' by
Erich Schiffmann (PocketBooks, 1996, paperback, $16).
</P>
<P>
   A more in-depth book on the philosophies of yoga. Local yoga
instructor Rebecca Thurman often recommends this book for people
wanting to learn more about the breathing, meditation and energy
involved in practicing yoga. The author is a yoga master who's been
featured in best-selling yoga videos with actress Ali MacGraw.
Recommended for those wanting to learn more about achieving asana,
the pose of stillness.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Yoga and the Quest for the True Self'' by Stephen Cope
(BantamDoubleday Dell Publishers, 1999, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   Just released, this book is by a psychotherapist who intended to
take a four-month break from his harried Boston yuppie lifestyle to
recover from a painful relationship loss and to explore the
question of his own life purpose. Ten years later, Cope is still at
the yoga retreat center in Lenox, Mass., teaching and hearing tales
from thousands of other contemporary soul seekers. His book
explores why Americans suffer from ``self-estrangement'' _ how
we're so self-involved that we've lost all connection to
surrounding communities of people and nature.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Integral Yoga Hatha'' by Swami Satchidananda (Integral Yoga
Distribution, 1998, $16.95 paperback).
</P>
<P>
   Continuously in print since 1970, this book is considered the
master of all yoga books. It's the book most often recommended by
local yoga instructor and chiropractor Deana Guadagno. She says the
large format size and 160 photographs make for easy comprehension
of postures, breathing practices, relaxation, cleansing and
concentration techniques. The author is one of the most followed
yogis in the country and will be appearing this weekend at the
Whole Life Expo in Atlanta.

   INTERNET SITE OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes health care consumers go to the Internet because they
are looking for information on a specific disease or drug.
Sometimes, they're just looking. Medscape (www.medscape.com) is a
good place to start looking. The multipage site, which claims more
than 1 million subscribers, is headed by Dr. George Lundberg,
editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Medscape offers daily medical news culled from wire services,
interactive dictionaries of medical terminology and drug
information, and searches of medical literature using MedLine, the
database of the National Library of Medicine. It also features
articles from medical journals, summaries of new research presented
at recent conferences and personalized home pages that can be
customized for particular areas of interest such as children's
diseases or HIV.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   When Neiko Fischbein watched television she got ``overcranked.''
No matter what, she could not sit still. ``She just seemed to be
attracted, or distracted, by everything in constant fashion,'' said
Dr. Ellen Fischbein, a psychiatrist who lives outside of New Haven.
``I'm kind of a high-energy person, but she exhausted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting attention deficit disorder, Dr. Fischbein took her
3{-year-old to see a behavior specialist, who concurred and
prescribed Dexedrine. Within two days, Dr. Fischbein had witnessed
a complete transformation in Neiko: ``It was like somebody had
virtually turned a dial.''
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, Neiko Fischbein is a Rottweiler.
</P>
<P>
   And just like humans, they sometimes need psychiatric help. Dr.
Nicholas Dodman, who prescribed Neiko's Dexedrine, is a leader in
the small but growing field of animal psychology, where many of the
current controversies echo eerily similar debates in the field of
human behavior. And while psychologists have drawn lessons from
animals since Pavlov's experiments a century ago, insights now are
flowing in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   The American Veterinary Medicine Association began to recognize
animal behavior as a board-certified specialty in 1993, and since
then, only 20 veterinarians, including Dodman, have earned the
certification. An animal behavior specialist at Tufts University,
Dodman is a co-author of the only veterinary textbook on the use of
psychopharmaceuticals in animals and has written several popular
books on behavior, including ``Dogs Behaving Badly'' (Bantam, 1999)
and ``The Cat Who Cried for Help'' (Bantam, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   But many others are hanging out shingles, from PhDs in
psychology to dog trainers, and they charge up to $250 as hour,
with telephone follow-ups). Other signs of the field's growth
abound. In January, the Food and Drug Administration officially
approved the use of two human psychopharmaceuticals, Clomicalm and
Anipryl, for mental problems in dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, which makes Clomicalm, an anti-anxiety drug, expects
it to produce $25 million a year in animal sales.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 29 veterinary schools in the United States now
offer residency programs in animal behavior. The Tufts University
Veterinary Center has started a fax-back service for pet owners who
cannot wait the three months to see Dodman.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in human psychology, many diagnoses and treatments are
controversial. Ian Dunbar, a psychologist and puppy training expert
in Berkeley, Calif., says that when he asks an owner about a dog's
annoying behaviors, he expects to hear about problems like chewing,
barking or escaping. But more and more, he said, ``people have
developed big names for mythical syndromes: things like separation
anxiety syndrome.'' He added: ``I just disagree with that. Dogs are
dogs and they do doggy things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar, who believes in positive-reinforcement, for dogs and
children, takes umbrage at the idea of ``separation anxiety'' in
pets. He argues that dogs that chew or bark or otherwise behave
badly when their owners leave are usually just cutting loose. ``The
dog learns it's simply bad news to act like a dog when the owners
are around,'' he said. Rather than getting a psychoactive drug, he
argues, pets need reward-based training in how to deal with
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   David Falk, an Airedale trainer based in Corinth, N.Y., agrees
that ``separation anxiety'' is just a word for boredom. ``They're
bored,'' he said. ``They tear your house apart. Are they bored
because you're gone? Or are they bored because they're bored?''
</P>
<P>
   Animal behavior specialists will probably always have to wrestle
with the accusation that they attributing human traits to animals.
But Dodman points out that sometimes a human diagnosis is as
controversial as a canine one; when it comes to attention deficit
disorder, for example, the British ``think Americans are crazy and
are overdosing their children'' with stimulants like Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in animals as in humans, he said, a conspicuous change in
activity level indicates a diagnosable condition. Give the creature
Ritalin or Dexedrine, and if it experiences the paradoxical
response of calming down, as Neiko did, the diagnosis is confirmed,
Dodman said.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers are among the most skeptical of assigning human
conditions to pets. Most pet behavior problems, they believe, stem
from either inappropriate human expectations or lack of training.
``A lot of these dogs are hard-wired for specific behaviors,'' said
Kilcommons, co-author of the book ``Paws to Consider'' (Warner
Books, 1999), adding that many owners picked breeds that were
entirely unsuited for their lifestyles. ``They buy a Weimaraner
because it's an attractive, handsome dog,'' he said. ``They don't
do their homework. You have to run this dog, at least two hours a
day of hard running.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Richmond, co-executive director of the Humane Society of
New York, says many dogs are labeled bad because they do not have
the opportunity to run off energy while the owners are at work.
``It would be like telling a 4-year-old to sit at a desk for 10
hours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman agrees that some odd dog behaviors do stem from modern
circumstances. He once had to euthanize a bull terrier named Teddy
when nothing would stop the dog from frantically chasing its tail.
Years later, a colleague pointed out that bull terriers were bred
as predators, specifically to kill rats.
</P>
<P>
   Many tail chasers, Dodman now believes, are simply pursuing the
``only potential prey'' in their environments. He treats them with
Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   As in human psychology, many problems can be alleviated through
a combination of retraining and psychopharmacology. Take
thunderstorm phobia, a common canine fear. Dr. Peter Borchelt, a
pet behavior expert in Brooklyn, N.Y., who has a PhD in psychology,
uses thunderstorm recordings and strobe lights to desensitize
fearful pets. When that fails, he may recommend anti-anxiety
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lessons that can be learned from pet psychology are
what makes good parents. ``That's the real importance of all this
puppy stuff,'' Dunbar said. ``There are three species in the world
which are regularly abused: dogs, horses and humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bonnie Beaver, a member of the executive board of Veterinary
Medicine Group AVMA, says that while many of the links between
animal and human psychology are speculative, this much is certain:
``People who are physically abusive of animals have a high
probability of physical abuse to people.'' In some jurisdictions,
animal-abuse authorities share information with child-abuse
agencies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite obvious connections between animals and humans in terms
of brain chemistry and behavior modification, there are areas of
human psychology where pets will probably never tread. Do not
expect Fido or Whiskers to be sharing their dreams anytime soon _
even though Dobermans are used by sleep researchers at Stanford to
study narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dr. Beaver, who is also a professor at Texas A&AMP;M
University, does not think animal behaviorists are years behind
their human counterparts, she does concede that she and her
colleagues must sometimes draw on insights from human psychology.
``Because,'' she explained, ``we can't talk to our clients.''

 &HT;    IOC official changes tune in effort to improve Olympic image
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The International Olympic Committee official who
accused the Atlanta Olympic bidders of ``pushing'' all those gifts
and favors on the unwitting IOC was in Atlanta on Monday eating a
bit of crow and drumming up support for closure of the corruption
scandal that has rocked the Olympic world.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that the IOC is headed for a radical shake-up next
month with new age limits for members and controls on gifts and bid
city visits, IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said the
public will accept the reforms and be ready to once again focus on
the core values of the Olympics _ peace, friendship and fair
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a major earthquake,'' said Servan-Schrieber, who
is visiting media and sponsors in the United States to explain the
49 reforms the IOC membership is set to vote upon in a special
meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland in December.
</P>
<P>
   He's trotting out a just completed worldwide study on the
Olympic image to demonstrate that while the public is disappointed
and concerned about the IOC as an institution, they still hold the
Olympic Games and the athletes in high regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Games have been totally untouched,'' he said. ``I'm not
talking about the IOC, but the Olympics. The value of the property
for the sponsors has not diminished at all.''
</P>
<P>
   If the reforms are passed, and he expects they will be,
Servan-Schreiber said he believes ``people will be satisfied we
have moved as fast as we could and have achieved a spectacular
proposition that will fundamentally change the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it still remains to be seen if the IOC members will
give up their favorite perk _ visits to bid cities. IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch wants to ban visits by all members except
those on a special evaluation commission, but others object.
</P>
<P>
   When the vote comes up in Lausanne, members will be asked to
either vote for a total ban, or agree to visits in organized groups
paid for by the IOC, not the city.
</P>
<P>
   Servan-Schrieber concedes the visits are a controversial issue,
brought to a glaring head with the Atlanta Olympic report prepared
for the U.S. House Commerce committee by former attorney general
Griffin Bell in September.
</P>
<P>
   IOC rules at the time only allowed one visit to a bid city and
members could only be accompanied by one guest, usually a spouse.
However, Bell found that dozens of IOC members made several trips
and often brought several family members.
</P>
<P>
   That was more troubling to IOC officials than the list of
excessive gifts lavished on visiting delegates by eager Atlanta
bidders. ``Yes, there were gifts, but the gifts don't seem to have
been very expensive,'' Servan-Schreiber said. ``It's the trips that
were an issue. It begs the question, should there be any trips at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only intense debate among members of the IOC 2000
reform commission last month was on the issue of visits to bid
cities. ``Some of the African members said it makes us looks like
criminals and a lot of people resent that,'' the IOC spokesman
recalled. ``But there's no question the way the visits have been
handled up to now would be radically changed.''
</P>
<P>
   While the IOC hierarchy now believes the visits to Atlanta were
excessive, Servan-Schreiber reiterated his earlier comments that
the Atlanta bidders essentially begged IOC members participate.
</P>
<P>
   When Samaranch's wife and two friends visited Atlanta, Savannah
and Charleston, S.C., at the expense of the Atlanta bidders _ an
egregious example of excessive hospitality cited by Congressmen
during a hearing in October _ it was at the insistence of Atlanta
bidders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clear invitation by the bid committee who repeated
and insisted, and in that light, out of politeness, she accepted,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But today Servan-Schreiber doesn't see anything nefarious in
those overtures. ``It's clear that Mr. Payne and Mr. Young had no
ulterior motives except to be friendly,'' he said. ``It should be
clear also this was the environment in which the bid was done.''
</P>
<P>
   That was precisely the defense argument Bell made in his report
to Congress. Every bid city was excessive in its courtship of IOC
members, and most cities were more excessive than Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Servan Schrieber doesn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it was just not the same caliber as Salt Lake City,''
he acknowledged. ``For example, in Salt Lake City some cash
exchanged hands. And that is a clear difference.''

HIT ON MICROSOFT SHARES NOT AS BAD AS EXPECTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: $8.4 billion in lede is cq)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. stock fell 1 5/8 a share Monday, far less than
expected, but wiped out $8.4 billion of investors' money in a day
filled with anticipation that a much bigger slide might pull the
entire market down with it.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street held its collective breath and braced for the
reaction to a finding by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, released
after the markets closed Friday, that the world's biggest software
company exerted monopoly power over would-be competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock slid as much as 8 percent early in the day but
recovered smartly. Trading volume reached a level four times the
daily average for the stock, indicating there were buyers eager to
snap up Microsoft shares being sold off by more negative investors.
The company's stock closed at 89-15/16.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been worse. Not only were Microsoft's losses
contained _ some had predicted the stock might drop as much as 15
percent _ major market indexes posted small declines Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Wall Street is telling you is Microsoft is the biggest
bully on the block, and they're not going to get hurt too badly by
this,'' said Katherine Kirk, a technology managing director in the
Boston office of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The techology-heavy Nasdaq stock index suffered most, falling
41.68 points, or 1.34 percent, and closing at 3143.97. The other
two major indexes dipped less than half a percentage point. The Dow
Jones industrial average _ which added Microsoft to its basket of
30 stocks last week _ fell 14.37 points, closing at 10,718.85, and
the S&AMP;P 500 index fell 6.78 points, closing at 1377.01.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's founder and chairman, William H. Gates, saw the
value of his holdings in the company decline by $1.27 billion
Monday. His Microsoft portfolio was still worth $70.24 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of companies that might benefit from the Microsoft ruling
soared. Red Hat Inc., a developer the Linux software that may one
day challenge Microsoft's Windows operating system, gained 18-1/16
a share, closing at 104. Apple Computer, maker of the Macintosh
operating system, jumped 8-1/16, to close at 96 3/8. Archrival Sun
Microsystems Inc., which is developing software that runs on any
operating system, gained 2 3/16, to close at 111 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   Fears that a Microsoft downturn could trip a broader market
decline were hardly alarmist: The software company's market value
of $460 billion value is the biggest of any US company and accounts
for about 4.5 percent of the value of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
stock index. Microsoft is held by about one-third of US mutual
funds and is typically among the biggest holding in their
portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jackson's preliminary finding that Microsoft ``stifled
innovation'' by using its dominance in PC operating systems to
quash rivals was ``pretty negative,'' according to Mark Corcoran, a
technology analyst with D.A. Davidson &AMP; Co. in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Windows operating system is installed in more than
90 percent of all personal computers sold worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised,'' Corcoran said. ``I thought Microsoft would be
down 10 or 15 bucks this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Microsoft's losses were contained because its
dominance is hardly news. Heavy trading in Microsoft's stock _
about 121 million shares traded Monday, compared with about 30
million on a typical day _ reflected division among investors over
whether the court would order a remedy, what that remedy might be,
and what its impact might be on the Redmond, Wash., software
behemoth would be.
</P>
<P>
   Given the harsh wording in Jackson's finding, analysts predicted
that the court's and the US Justice Department's choices boil down
to either requiring Microsoft to change its brutish tactics in
selling software or to spin off as separate companies the
businesses units that sell Windows, or the Internet Explorer
browser, Office software, and other products.
</P>
<P>
   In the most extreme outcome, a breakup of Microsoft, the
company's future may be bright, said William Rhodes, vice president
of investment strategy in the Boston office of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Standard Oil or American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph are any
guide to what happens, shareholders will not end up losing,''
Rhodes said. ``They'll be just as well to hold the stock, ride it
out, and hold the companies in the new portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T in an antitrust case brought by
the US government, the stocks of the Baby Bell telephone companies
climbed, as did shares of the equipment division, Lucent
Technologies Inc. Under the court-ordered breakup, AT&AMP;T
shareholders received shares in each of the spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   At Microsoft, some units are growing faster than the overall
company, analysts said, providing evidence the parts may one day be
worth more than the whole company. Sales by Microsoft's Internet
business, for example, are growing more than 75 percent per year,
compared with 20 percent annual sales gains companywide.
</P>
<P>
   Short of busting up Microsoft, analysts speculated on other
remedies the judge might choose.
</P>
<P>
   Most clear in Jackson's ruling, analyst Corcoran said, was a
finding that Microsoft hampered the success of other companies
selling browsers, namely Netscape Communications Corp., by
requiring that Microsoft's Internet Explorer be bundled with its
Windows operating system. (Earlier this year, America Online Inc.
acquired Netscape.)
</P>
<P>
   If Microsoft misused its muscle in selling everything from its
Office software suite to its Internet product, the judge may seek a
broader remedy to halt Microsoft from obstructing competition in
selling a range of products, Corcoran said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge might ``say is Microsoft cannot obstruct other
companies and other software developers from building
Windows-compatible products that can be ported to other platforms,
such as Unix or Java or Linus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts listed several reasons Jackson's finding did not result
in pandemonium, as some feared.
</P>
<P>
   First, since the finding was issued Friday, investors had the
weekend to digest its meaning. Most concluded that Jackson's next
decision _ whether Microsoft violated antitrust laws and how to
remedy that _ will be more important. That won't be known for
months, or even years, if the case is appealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just the opening chapter in a multichapter book,''
said James Weiss, deputy head of equities for State Street Research
&AMP; Management Co. in Boston.

 &HT;    IOC official changes tune in effort to improve Olympic image
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news and (s) Sports categories.)
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The International Olympic Committee official who
accused the Atlanta Olympic bidders of ``pushing'' all those gifts
and favors on the unwitting IOC was in Atlanta on Monday eating a
bit of crow and drumming up support for closure of the corruption
scandal that has rocked the Olympic world.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that the IOC is headed for a radical shake-up next
month with new age limits for members and controls on gifts and bid
city visits, IOC spokesman Franklin Servan-Schreiber said the
public will accept the reforms and be ready to once again focus on
the core values of the Olympics _ peace, friendship and fair
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a major earthquake,'' said Servan-Schrieber, who
is visiting media and sponsors in the United States to explain the
49 reforms the IOC membership is set to vote upon in a special
meeting in Lausanne, Switzerland in December.
</P>
<P>
   He's trotting out a just completed worldwide study on the
Olympic image to demonstrate that while the public is disappointed
and concerned about the IOC as an institution, they still hold the
Olympic Games and the athletes in high regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Games have been totally untouched,'' he said. ``I'm not
talking about the IOC, but the Olympics. The value of the property
for the sponsors has not diminished at all.''
</P>
<P>
   If the reforms are passed, and he expects they will be,
Servan-Schreiber said he believes ``people will be satisfied we
have moved as fast as we could and have achieved a spectacular
proposition that will fundamentally change the IOC.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it still remains to be seen if the IOC members will
give up their favorite perk _ visits to bid cities. IOC President
Juan Antonio Samaranch wants to ban visits by all members except
those on a special evaluation commission, but others object.
</P>
<P>
   When the vote comes up in Lausanne, members will be asked to
either vote for a total ban, or agree to visits in organized groups
paid for by the IOC, not the city.
</P>
<P>
   Servan-Schrieber concedes the visits are a controversial issue,
brought to a glaring head with the Atlanta Olympic report prepared
for the U.S. House Commerce committee by former attorney general
Griffin Bell in September.
</P>
<P>
   IOC rules at the time only allowed one visit to a bid city and
members could only be accompanied by one guest, usually a spouse.
However, Bell found that dozens of IOC members made several trips
and often brought several family members.
</P>
<P>
   That was more troubling to IOC officials than the list of
excessive gifts lavished on visiting delegates by eager Atlanta
bidders. ``Yes, there were gifts, but the gifts don't seem to have
been very expensive,'' Servan-Schreiber said. ``It's the trips that
were an issue. It begs the question, should there be any trips at
all?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only intense debate among members of the IOC 2000
reform commission last month was on the issue of visits to bid
cities. ``Some of the African members said it makes us looks like
criminals and a lot of people resent that,'' the IOC spokesman
recalled. ``But there's no question the way the visits have been
handled up to now would be radically changed.''
</P>
<P>
   While the IOC hierarchy now believes the visits to Atlanta were
excessive, Servan-Schreiber reiterated his earlier comments that
the Atlanta bidders essentially begged IOC members participate.
</P>
<P>
   When Samaranch's wife and two friends visited Atlanta, Savannah
and Charleston, S.C., at the expense of the Atlanta bidders _ an
egregious example of excessive hospitality cited by Congressmen
during a hearing in October _ it was at the insistence of Atlanta
bidders, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a clear invitation by the bid committee who repeated
and insisted, and in that light, out of politeness, she accepted,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But today Servan-Schreiber doesn't see anything nefarious in
those overtures. ``It's clear that Mr. Payne and Mr. Young had no
ulterior motives except to be friendly,'' he said. ``It should be
clear also this was the environment in which the bid was done.''
</P>
<P>
   That was precisely the defense argument Bell made in his report
to Congress. Every bid city was excessive in its courtship of IOC
members, and most cities were more excessive than Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Servan Schrieber doesn't disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it was just not the same caliber as Salt Lake City,''
he acknowledged. ``For example, in Salt Lake City some cash
exchanged hands. And that is a clear difference.''

 &HT;    New approach: Drug helps clear arteries
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new drug made by an Alpharetta, Ga., company shows
potential in unplugging millions of Americans' clogged arteries,
researchers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A report on the drug, called AGI-1067, was among research
presented at a meeting of the American Heart Association in
Atlanta, where scientists also heard about new blood pressure drugs
and the heart-healthy benefits of exercise.
</P>
<P>
   The drug treats clogged arteries by reducing inflammation of the
arterial lining and lowering cholesterol. In experiments on mice
that were bred to have high cholesterol levels, the drug inhibited
the progression of atherosclerosis _ the narrowing or blocking of
coronary arteries _ by 66 percent after 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a whole new notion that inflammation of the blood
vessels is a big part of atherosclerosis,'' said Dr. Uday Saxena,
vice president of preclinical research at AtheroGenics, an
Alpharetta biopharmaceutical company. ``There are no drugs out
there now that can do this. This is a whole new approach to disease
management.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 11 million Americans suffer from clogged arteries,
which puts them at high risk for a heart attack or stroke. Eating
too much food that's high in cholesterol, such as meat and
whole-milk diary products, can lead to the buildup of plaque in the
arteries. The accumulation of plaque presents a major health threat
as people age because their arteries become too narrow for blood
and oxygen to reach the heart or brain.
</P>
<P>
   Bypass surgery and angioplasty have been common treatments to
clear narrowed arteries. But research in the past decade has
focused on developing drugs to lower elevated cholesterol and
reverse or prevent atherosclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   While AtheroGenics' researchers cautioned that the successful
research to date is only based on mice models, they also provided a
dose of hope at the medical conference that continues through
Wednesday at the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   It could take seven to 10 years for the drug to pass all
required federal mandates of safety, efficacy and risk.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings released at the conference included:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Women who follow all the standard health advice _ eat
sensibly, don't smoke, exercise, keep weight down, have only an
occasional drink _ can reduce their chance of heart disease 82
percent. But only 1 percent of the women in the Nurses' Health
Study actually followed all those rules.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  A study proving that middle-aged women can avoid weight gain
accompanying menopause by following a low-fat, reduced-calorie diet
and increasing physical activity. The five-year University of
Pittsburgh study divided women into two groups, a behavioral
intervention group and a control group. Women who did not exercise
regularly or follow the low-fat diet gained an average of 5.2
pounds, while the intervention group maintained weight or dropped a
pound on average.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An experimental class of drugs appears to be the most potent
ever at reducing high blood pressure. The new medicines are called
vasopeptidase inhibitors. Several are in development, but the
furthest along is Bristol-Myers Squibb's Vanlev, known generically
as omapatrilat. Like standard ACE inhibitors, the vasopeptidase
inhibitors block an enzyme that raises blood pressure. However, the
medicine also stops another enzyme called neutral endopeptidase,
protecting the body's supply of helpful substances that make blood
vessels relax.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  AIDS patients taking protease inhibitors may be at risk for
developing coronary artery disease because the drugs lead to a
dysfunction of the lining of the blood vessels that regulate blood
flow and blood clotting. University of Wisconsin researchers
stressed that the findings are preliminary and ``in no way suggest
that HIV protease inhibitors in fact do more harm than good.''

ON ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES, BUSH PREFERS COOPERATION TO CONFRONTATION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JIM YARDLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Early this summer, with political pressure
mounting to address his state's severe air pollution problems, Gov.
George W. Bush signed a law he regards as the gold star of his
green resume: a program to regulate outdated industrial plants that
are among the heaviest polluters in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, who began his career in the oil fields of West Texas,
the program meant confronting the oil, gas and chemical industries
that are among his most generous contributors. With the law, Bush
now boasts that he is the first Texas governor ``to ever have
brought industry together and said, `Get into compliance.'''
</P>
<P>
   What he actually did was a little different, and it offers
insight into Bush's operating style on environmental issues, a
style widely praised by business but heavily criticized by
environmental groups. Although state regulators had been
considering mandatory restrictions on polluters, state documents
indicate that Bush thought the approach should be voluntary and
essentially asked industry leaders to draft a proposal, which they
did in private meetings with state officials two years ago. No
environmentalists or other public interest groups were invited, and
they only learned about the meetings early this year.
</P>
<P>
   In any assessment of Bush's environmental record, the
unmistakable subtext is the governor's relationship with business
and industrial leaders. As an advocate of limited government, Bush
believes that lawsuits and regulations are not the best way to
achieve clean air and water. Instead, his aides say, Bush has
pursued a cooperative approach that emphasizes voluntary solutions
instead of government mandates.
</P>
<P>
   But with Bush leading the Republican presidential race,
environmentalists are criticizing his closeness to the industries
regulated by his administration in Texas. Campaign records indicate
that the companies that helped draft the new pollution law have
since donated nearly $1 million to Bush's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, environmentalists say the law itself, which allows
companies to voluntarily come under state permit requirements, is
weak and riddled with loopholes. They say other laws and policy
changes during Bush's tenure have had the accumulated result of
weakening oversight of industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an environmental policy being run by business and
industry and their friends in the regulatory agency,'' said Ken
Kramer, director of the Lone Star chapter of the Sierra Club.
``That means there will be very little scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his father, former President George Bush, who declared
himself ``the environmental president,'' the younger Bush has not
emphasized environmental issues since he became governor in 1995,
despite the fact that Texas ranks as one of the most polluted
states in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In his presidential campaign, the governor has yet to articulate
a national environmental policy, as he has on issues like education
and health. His critics say the environment hardly registers on
Bush's political radar; his admirers say Bush is not hostile to the
environment but merely reflects the conservative politics of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is not California,'' said Andrew Sansom, the executive
director of the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife. ``There's
no groundswell of support for environmental issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Even many Democrats say there are limits, politically, to what
can be accomplished in Texas. The biggest environmental victory
this year came when the Legislature passed a utility deregulation
bill that required outdated utilities to cut pollution. The author
of that bill, state Rep. Steven Wolens, a Democrat from Dallas,
credits Bush for endorsing it.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Wolens characterized the voluntary law championed
by Bush as ``a lot of sweet talk with no teeth in it.'' Still, he
said, ``it's better than having no bill.'' In Texas, he added,
``it's just not realistic to have expected more, to have even hoped
for more.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people, including federal regulators, say Texas can no
longer afford any apathy toward its environment. The problems of
automobile exhaust and industrial pollution have created severe air
quality problems. Overall, nearly half of the state's 19 million
people live in areas that failed to meet federal standards for
ozone, which is linked to lung damage and is a primary ingredient
in smog.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the state's largest city, Houston, is expected to
pass Los Angeles as the nation's smog leader. And the state's
second-largest metropolitan area, Dallas-Fort Worth, has been
downgraded by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from
``moderate'' to ``serious'' for its high levels of ozone. In March,
the state failed to meet a deadline to submit a plan to the EPA
detailing how Dallas-Fort Worth would reduce ozone levels. Two
months later, the EPA threatened to suspend federal highway money
if a plan was not developed by next year.
</P>
<P>
   Pollution is not new to Texas, a heavily industrialized state,
which might explain why most Texans do not seem to blame Bush for
the air problems. Bush has even boasted that air quality had
improved during his tenure. ``You've got to ask the question, `Is
the air cleaner since I became governor?''' Bush said in the
spring. ``And the answer is `Yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such blanket statements are not easily proved, particularly
since pollution can be measured in different ways. Compared to two
decades ago, when industry operated with fewer restrictions, air
quality has generally improved in Texas. For many years, the
hundreds of pollutants like benzene, ammonia and chlorine were the
primary measuring stick for air quality. Linked to cancer as well
as neurological and developmental problems, these pollutants have
declined in Texas since the late 1980s, though the state still
leads the nation in toxic emissions.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, however, attribute the reductions to federal
mandates and actions taken by Bush's predecessor as governor, Ann
Richards, a point Bush's aides do not dispute. They point out that
Texas now leads the nation in the reduction of toxic pollutants;
however, environmentalists say that is misleading. A statistical
analysis shows that reduction rates were higher under Ms. Richards,
whose administration received mixed reviews from environmentalists.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Today, attention is focused on ozone pollution, which is formed
from nitrogen oxide and volatile organic compounds that are emitted
by gasoline stations, automobiles and smokestacks. In recent
months, the severe ozone problems in Houston and Dallas-Fort Worth
has led to increased criticism of state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists blamed Bush and his appointees for failing to
address the ozone problems.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Texas has endured one of the worst ozone
summers on record. So far this year, the state has registered the
24 worst smog readings in the country, including a reading in
Houston on Oct. 7 that registered at twice the maximum level
allowed by national health standards.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three decades, the problem of air pollution in Texas
attracted limited attention. The state passed a Clean Air Act in
1971, but the law did not require existing industries to obtain
permits. Eventually, the law's supporters reasoned, these
industries would become obsolete and shut down.
</P>
<P>
   But by late 1996, as the EPA pressured state and local officials
to clean up the air, state officials began to realize that more
than one third of Texas' industrial air pollution was coming from
outdated smokestacks operating without state permits. Overall,
almost half of the state's 1,648 industrial plants enjoyed some
measure of grandfathered protection.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, Ralph Marquez, Bush's first appointee to the
Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission, called a meeting
with industry representatives. Minutes of those meetings indicate
that state officials were considering a plan to force the outdated
plants to upgrade pollution equipment and reduce emissions.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 14, 1997, however, John Howard, the governor's
environmental policy director, in a memo to Bush, wrote: ``Industry
has expressed concern that the TNRCC is moving too quickly and may
rashly seek legislation this session.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Howard recommended that the governor support a proposal
to create a public task force that would prepare a voluntary plan
that could be presented in the 1999 Legislature. This idea became a
reality on Sept. 10, 1997, when Bush announced the Clean Air
Responsibility Enterprise Committee, which included business
leaders and environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   But eight months before the public committee was formed,
industry executives, state regulators and on some occasions,
Howard, had begun holding a series of private meetings. In fact, on
June 19, 1997, A.L. Condray, the president of Exxon, and Victor G.
Beghini, the president of Marathon Oil, had presented a proposal to
petrochemical executives. Their plan did not require companies to
meet state pollution standards, but instead made the program
voluntary, allowing a grace period for companies that chose to take
part.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo circulated at the meeting, the two executives noted
that Bush had asked them to draft a proposal. Aides to Bush say the
meetings were nothing more than ``preliminary fact-finding'' which
is common in developing legislation. But at least one participant
on June 19 found it unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very strange meeting to me in that the approach of
the presenters was pretty much like, `This is the way it's going to
be _ do you want to get on board or not?''' one of the
participants, Jim E. Kennedy, an engineer with DuPont, wrote in a
e-mail the next day to other chemical industry executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the `insiders' from oil and gas believe that the
governor's office will `persuade' the TNRCC to accept whatever
program is developed between the industry group and the governor's
office,'' Kennedy added. He concluded that ``the concept paper has
no `meat' with respect to actual emissions reductions. One of the
leaders actually stated that emissions reductions was not a primary
driver for the program.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy e-mail was included in documents that became public
early this summer after an Austin-based environmentalist, Peter
Altman, filed an open records request.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in the environmental community knew these meetings were
going on to shape policy, and no one was invited to participate,''
said Altman, executive director of Sustainable Energy &AMP; Economic
Development Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon officials declined to comment, but a Marathon Oil
spokesman said his company frequently meets with state and local
officials to discuss policy. He said such meetings were conducted
with ``high integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was passed this year by the Legislature, and though it
did undergo changes, it resembles the proposal pitched by industry
in the private meetings. Environmentalists tried, but failed, to
change the law.
</P>
<P>
   State officials say the law will allow them to regulate
companies that had operated for decades without pollution permits.
But Altman and other environmentalists complain the policy is very
weak, does not establish goals for reducing emissions and will not
significantly cut pollution.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials confirmed that the law does not contain nearly
enough reductions for the state to meet federal ozone standards.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Schneider, executive director of Public Research Works, a
nonprofit environmental research and education organization, said
the companies that attended the meetings are among Bush's most
reliable and generous contributors. Analyzing Bush's presidential
campaign contributions between March and June, Ms. Schneider traced
at least $973,000 to employees or family members of the companies
attending the meetings, or to lawyers and lobbyists that represent
the companies.
</P>
<P>
   The same analysis showed that Beghini, who retired last month as
Marathon Oil president, gave the maximum $1,000 contribution, as
did his wife. B.W. Coleman, the chairman and chief executive of
Texaco Inc., another company that attended the private meetings,
also gave the maximum, as did his wife. At least nine of Bush's
``pioneers'' _ people who have pledged to raise at least $100,000
for his campaign _ are connected to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think business executives know to invest in the Bush
campaign for pollution friendly policies,'' Ms. Schneider said.
``They're hoping he will be making air pollution policies at the
national level.''
</P>
<P>
   Marquez, however, said environmentalists wrongly believe that
government must have an adversarial relationship with industry.
``Texas has always worked with the regulated community in coming up
with solutions,'' said Marquez, who attended several of the 1997
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a Bush campaign spokesman, said the governor
does not make decisions based on campaign contributions but on
``what is best for Texas.'' He also said that Kennedy's
characterization of the June 19 meeting ``was not accurate.''
Kennedy could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Bush considers the law a significant
accomplishment. ``I'm the person who initiated the discussions, I'm
the person who asked industry to get into compliance, and they
did,'' Bush said. No other Texas governor, he noted, had ever
addressed the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last month, Bush said the best way to achieve
clean air and water ``is to work with local jurisdictions using
market-based solutions and not try to sue our way or regulate our
way to clean air and clean water.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In outlining Bush's environmental beliefs, his aides say he has
pursued a ``balanced approach.'' While campaigning for president,
Bush has taken a few environmental positions, notably his
opposition to an agreement signed two years ago in Kyoto, Japan,
that establishes emission targets for industrial nations. In the
past he has criticized federal regulation, particularly when he
regards it as too intrusive; in his 1994 campaign for governor, he
lashed out against the Endangered Species Act as overly intrusive
on landowners.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists say Bush has eroded environmental protections
since becoming governor in 1995. During the 1995 legislative
session, Bush and the Legislature overturned an unpopular program
signed by Ms. Richards that would have established a stringent,
centralized vehicle inspections program to reduce pollution and
instead instituted a more lenient program.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bush signed a law that allows companies to audit
themselves for environmental violations. If a company found any
violations, the law allowed it to report the violations without
fear of fine or penalty as long as the company presented a cleanup
plan. Nor would the violation be made public. .
</P>
<P>
   ``From our experience,'' Marquez said, ``things we are seeing
reported are things our inspectors might never have found.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics described the law as a ``stay out of jail'' card for
polluters. Ms. Schneider of Public Research Works noted that the
same industry groups who supported the law also contributed more
than $4 million to Bush's gubernatorial campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Nelly Rocha, special counsel to the EPA's regional administrator
in Dallas, called the audit law in Texas one of the most generous
to industry of its kind. When the EPA protested to Texas officials,
the law was amended in 1997 to, among other things, remove the
criminal immunity.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Rocha said the law still ``is probably one of the most
liberal laws in our viewpoint.'' Rocha said federal regulators
oppose all state laws that provide privilege immunity to polluting
companies. State officials say that 1,057 companies have conducted
self-audits since the law went into effect and 260 of them
disclosed some type of violation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Bush also reshaped the three-member state environmental
regulatory commission by first appointing Marquez, a former
employee of Monsanto Chemical. Currently, all three commissioners
have industry connections.
</P>
<P>
   The state commission, in turn, has established what
environmentalists consider to be a business friendly tone. For
years, Texas has boasted a statute that allows citizens to
challenge pollution permits through a process much like a courtroom
trial. Such hearings are rare, but citizen groups have used the
procedure to stop unwanted projects. Most recently, a planned
nuclear waste dump in West Texas was blocked, in part, because of
opposition from a hearing. The new commission, however, has reduced
the number of hearings to eight in 1998 from 25 in 1996, statistics
show. In four cases, state courts have overturned the commission's
refusal to hold a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The same commission also approved a written policy change that
forbade surprise inspections of industries. The commission
eventually backed down after heavy criticism, though surprise
inspections are still considered rare. The state has helped
industry in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've cut out public oversight and public participation, and
we're adding greater pollution to our water and our land,'' said
Richard Lowerre, an environmental lawyer from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubt that environmental issues will nag at Texas as
Bush campaigns for president. State and local officials are
preparing an ozone reduction plan for Dallas-Fort Worth. In
Houston, where the planning is further along, the city is facing
potentially draconian changes: huge cuts in industrial pollution, a
suspension of heavy construction projects during morning hours and
more stringent emissions testing for automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, as rush hour commuters in Houston drove along a
clogged street, a small band of protesters wave placards: ``We
finally beat L.A.,'' one sign read. ``Houston No. 1 in air
pollution.''

   &UR; WHY SHE HATES SAN FRANCISCO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Ex-New Yorker  &UR; Alexandra Zissu &LR;  moved to San Francisco in
September _ to follow a boyfriend who was chasing an e-career _ and
hasn't yet left her heart here. In an essay in the New York
Observer, Zissu shares some of her complaints:
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco sucks. I mean really, really sucks. ... I loathe
San Francisco. You can't hail a cab. You can't jaywalk. The people
are ugly and unfashionable. Nobody has boundaries: They walk right
up to you on the street and say things or even tap you on your
arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Her living space is too big. ``The apartment makes me
uncomfortable; growing up in New York, my bedroom was the size of
my closet here. What to do with all this space?'' What's more,
``There are more homeless people here than I have ever seen in my
entire New York life, and most of them are 16-year-old white kids.
You can buy California wine in New York, but you can't get a slice
of pizza in San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Zissu calls the nightlife ``pathetic,'' and complains that ``to
go from one bar to the next you have to walk and walk and walk.''
Furthermore, ``bars close at 2 a.m. and you can't smoke in them. No
one ever has wet hair, which leads me to believe no one bathes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Personals called to ask Zissu if she had anything to add
for San Francisco readers, the author responded: ``This piece is as
much about my own limitations as it is about the limitations of San
Francisco. I am sure any San Franciscan new to New York could
produce an equally amusing and spirited rant; the material is
certainly there.''

MAGNET THERAPY HAS ROOTS IN ANCIENT CULTURES
</HEADLINE>
  (Includes color photos of magnets in use on body and a couple using
magnet therapy) 
 By MATTHEW K. PRUITT 
 c.1999 NYT Regional Newspapers 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pat and Maria McCall have a shared attraction. You could even
call it a magnetism.
</P>
<P>
   The faux-pearl necklace that Maria McCall, 58, wears is laden
with magnets in disguise _ every other bead is a little ball of
magnetic activity.
</P>
<P>
   Her 61-year-old husband, Pat, wears his magnets inside a cloth
brace covering his left knee. One flat, circular disk is on one
side of the knee, its twin on the other side.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartanburg, S.C., couple, like a growing number of
Americans, wear the specialized magnets to relieve a host of
ailments, ranging from joint pain to breathing difficulty.
</P>
<P>
   Many professional athletes, especially golfers, swear by them.
Magnets are now being sold in shoes, wrist bands, jewelry, mattress
pads and pillows.
</P>
<P>
   Using magnetic fields for healing dates back to ancient cultures
in Egypt, China and Greece. Lodestones, rocks with strong magnetic
properties, were the agents of choice then.
</P>
<P>
   The modern practice consists of one of two methods: placing
magnets on the affected area, or using machines to generate highly
focused electromagnetic fields applied to aching joints or muscles.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that magnets, when placed on painful joints or
muscles, stimulate blood flow to the areas, which facilitates
healing and pain relief. But few significant controlled studies
have been done to verify the healing effect of applying magnets to
the body.
</P>
<P>
   Both the American Medical Association and the Food and Drug
Administration say there's not enough scientific proof that such
magnet therapy works.
</P>
<P>
   There have been several scattered studies supporting the claims,
however.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) A 1997 study at Houston's Baylor College of Medicine
found that applying magnets of a relatively high intensity can
control pain for postpolio patients. But the doctors reported they
couldn't find any other significant research on the healing effects
of magnets.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) In a New York study published last year in the American
Journal of Pain Management, 24 patients found that wearing magnetic
footpad insoles relieved foot pain caused by diabetes and other
ailments.
</P>
<P>
   (BULLET) A number of patients were successfully treated for
chronic joint pain and swelling with highly focused and controlled
magnetic fields by Dr. Robert Holcomb and Dr. Michael McLean at the
Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. A summary
of this work can be found on the Vanderbilt Web site.
(www.vanderbilt.edu)
</P>
<P>
   Chiropractor and acupuncturist Alan Bonebrake of Irving, Tex.,
says the use of magnets has been proven effective over thousands of
years, since it stems from the ancient healing arts. He has treated
patients for a variety of ills with magnets for about 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's most effective on pain and circulation disturbances,''
Bonebrake says. ''When you get a negative polarity field, it causes
blood vessels to dilate and a shift in the ions. This can correct
nerve functioning.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, some companies sell cheap, bipolar magnets placed in
mattresses and such, which can even make things worse in the long
run.''
</P>
<P>
   The monopolar magnets used in research and sold by catalogs are
anywhere from 10 to 400 times as strong as ordinary,
refrigerator-type magnets. These powerful magnets cost from $40 for
joint supports or bracelets to $1,000 for larger, more specialized
devices.
</P>
<P>
   ''These products are safe, and it's certainly worth a try,''
says Mike McCormick, founder of Magnetic Solutions, L.L.C., a
manufacturer and distributor of magnetic therapy products in
Arlington, Tex. ''They work effectively for the greater majority of
people, and the worst that can happen to you is...nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   While doctors tend to agree that magnet therapy is, at the
least, harmless for most, they caution pregnant women and people
with pacemakers or other electronic implants not to use magnets.
</P>
<P>
   The varied applications of legitimate magnet therapy are only
starting to be discovered, say researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Dorlan, of Spartanburg, is conducting a controlled
study examining the effects of electromagnetic fields on a common
form of arthritis. Dorlan will study 60 patients over a six-month
period.
</P>
<P>
   The fields are generated by a patented machine that pulses
magnetic fields over the affected area for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Dorlan said the treatment has proved effective in easing the
pain of arthritis and stimulating cartilage growth. This treatment
is so well accepted abroad that doctors routinely use it to treat
acute sport injuries, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no correlation between this and those magnets that
stick on,'' he said. ''We don't know what those do. There is
anecdotal evidence, but you cannot point to legitimate studies in
the literature that show improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters such as the McCalls, however, strongly believe in
magnets' healing powers. Maria McCall sometimes places magnets on
her chest when she sleeps to help her breathe and uses a roller
containing magnets on her back to relieve pain or just to relax.
</P>
<P>
   And Pat McCall, an engineer for 20 years, says the magnets
alleviated a near-crippling pain in his knee, allowing him to
continue competitive cycling and even to shorten his racing time.
</P>
<P>
   ''These things work,'' he said. ''There's no doubt about it.''

DOES YOUR CHILD HAVE A SPEECH PROBLEM?
</HEADLINE>
  By KATHERINE MARTIN  
 c.1999 Katherine Martin 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents of a new baby eagerly watch for each milestone in the
developmental process: the first smile, the first step, the first
babyish babbling. But if that babbling doesn't turn into clear
speech after a few years, parents become concerned and wonder if
they should intervene.
</P>
<P>
   If you notice some difficulty when your child speaks, how can
you tell whether it is a genuine speech or language problem or if
your child is simply going through a developmental process of trial
and error? Here are some guidelines to help you consider if it's
time to consult a professional or simply to take a ''wait and see''
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Experts consider three basic areas essential to communication:
articulation, language, and listening and auditory processing.
 &UR; Articulation &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Articulation is our ability to speak clearly and intelligibly.
An example of this would be the child who mixes up speech sounds
within a word, such as ''wed'' for ''red'', ''diddy'' for
''kitty'', or ''cah'' for ''car''. It is quite normal for children
to go through a process of trial and error until their articulation
skills emerge and mature.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you do if you observe these behaviors?
</P>
<P>
   Keep the following factors in mind:
</P>
<P>
   1. The age of your child. Articulation skills develop
progressively. In other words, some sounds develop earlier than
others. If your child is in preschool and can't say ''s'' or ''r''
yet, remember that these sounds don't emerge until later (age 6 for
''r'' and age 8 for ''s'').
</P>
<P>
   However, if your child is school age and cannot say the earlier
developing sounds (for example, ''p'', ''m'', ''n'', ''w'', ''b'',
and ''k'' to name just a few) then it may be cause for concern. In
general, most children can say the speech sounds of the language by
age 8, assuming there are no other physical or congenital problems
present such as hearing loss, cleft lip or palate.
</P>
<P>
   2. The number of sounds in error. In other words, the more
speech sounds your child has difficulty with, the more likely he or
she will be a candidate for speech therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Resist the temptation to force the child to say the word
correctly. Rather than stating, ''No, don't say that, say ____'',
simply model the correct production for the child after he or she
makes an error and move on.
 &UR; Language &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What are some of the behaviors you may see in a child with
language difficulties? One example might be the child who can't get
the right grammar, for example, ''Me eated apple.'' Another
possibility might be the child who uses the improper name for a
concept, such as calling a horse a cow. Or maybe the child is
talking in sentences, but he or she just rambles and it is
difficult, at best, to make sense of what the child means.
</P>
<P>
   Again, it is quite normal for children to have grammatical
errors in their speech as they develop their skills, and confusion
with vocabulary terms will occur.
</P>
<P>
   So how will you know if your child is going through a stage
rather than developing a true problem?
</P>
<P>
   First, consult one of the many language development guides
available through the American Speech-Language Hearing Association
(ASHA) or a book that specifically addresses language issues in
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the meanwhile, it is important to keep these guidelines in
mind:
</P>
<P>
   1. The development of speech and language skills in the first
three years is critical to a child's future academic success in
school. In order for children to build a strong language base, it
is important to provide them with a variety of experiences from
infancy onward. This includes play through toys, objects, books,
games (make up your own) and interactions with real people, rather
than the television, Nintendo, or a computer.
</P>
<P>
   2. Whenever we develop language, remember that our understanding
or comprehension of a concept (receptive language) will always
develop before our expressive language. In other words, if you want
your child to say the word ''ball'', he or she will first have to
develop an understanding of what a ''ball'' is through exposure to
it via play, games and so forth.
 &UR; Listening &QL;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   How are your children's listening skills? Are they getting
plenty of practice at home before they are of school age? Our
listening skills (some refer to this as auditory processing) are
very important to building a strong foundation for language and
subsequently academic success. If your children aren't taught at
home how to listen, don't expect this skill to spontaneously
develop once they are in school.
</P>
<P>
   Listening goes beyond having good hearing. Good hearing means
that if we hooked our ears up to an audiometer to be tested, we
would have no problem hearing the tones that are presented through
the headset. Good listening means that the message traveled from
the ears to the brain where we comprehended and attached meaning to
what was said, and then responded appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   What can a parent do to develop better listening habits,
particularly if the child is displaying some difficulty listening
anyway? Here are some suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   1. Good listening habits are learned from people, not things.
Listening takes practice, and it requires that there be a listener
and speaker interacting with one another in a ''live''
give-and-take process. Once again, the television, computer, or
videos won't substitute.
</P>
<P>
   2. If you want your children to listen to you, listen to them by
giving them your full attention. Turn off the radio, television,
dishwasher, or computer. Be present in the same room, have your
face visible to your child, and obtain eye contact before speaking.
</P>
<P>
   3. Keep it simple. You can tell your child, ''After you go
upstairs to brush your teeth, come back to the kitchen and feed the

 &HT;    Lewis returns to spotlight, awaits respect
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ This is the moment for Lennox Lewis. The defining
moment. To this point of an accomplished career, the heavyweight
champion from England generally has been regarded as a big man with
a big punch _ and, significantly, a big, lingering question mark.
Whom has he beaten?
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Lewis has conquered all challengers, except, of
course, Evander Holyfield in March, which is a point of contention
for many people, particularly him. The problem with the fighters
Lewis did defeat is that none are of renown.
</P>
<P>
   So, now comes Holyfield again, Saturday night at the Thomas &AMP;
Mack Center. This time, he represents the hurdle that could lift
Lennox Lewis to more than the undisputed heavyweight championship.
A win, a resounding win over one of boxing's true warriors would
give Lewis respect.
</P>
<P>
   In the fight game, that's a coveted label, worth more than the
$15 million he'll earn for the bout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox is a two-time champion and he still hasn't won the
public's respect,'' Lewis' trainer, Emanuel Steward said. ``He
still hasn't had that great, solid fight. Lennox has not enjoyed a
great victory over a big, great fighter. Mike Tyson and Riddick
Bowe threw away their belts to not fight Lennox. Then he gets
Evander, controls the fight and gets a bad decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, he has a second chance now. But Lennox has to win big to
even be in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's exactly what Lewis said he expects. The response from
people on the street has bolstered his confidence into the
stratosphere. And the more he watches footage from the first
Holyfield bout, the more Lewis feels like a winner, if not an
official victor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I gave (Holyfield) a bit too much respect,'' Lewis said.
``But I was hitting him three shots to one. And I look back, and
there was so much more I could have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time will be even easier,'' he said. ``I really feel I
need to knock him out. . . . The only way I lose this fight is if I
stick out my chin and say, `OK, Evander. Hit me.' I'm still
unheralded. There's still a lot from me you haven't seen. If
Evander is better, it'll bring out the best in me.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward, a highly respected trainer, said Lewis has prepared
himself physically to perform at his best, which would be too much
for Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox is in better condition this time,'' Steward said. ``He
played with Evander the first time, made him look like a little
kid. This time, he's trained much harder. He's focused on a
knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 5 inches and somewhere around 245 pounds, Lewis dwarfs
Holyfield, who is 6 feet 2 inches and about 216 pounds. But Steward
claims that Lewis' performance in the first fight has fostered a
greater advantage for his fighter over Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Lennox and Evander are together, it's to the point where
Evander is almost intimidated to be around Lennox,'' Steward said.
``Lennox got through his first super fight. That was big for him.
And he's over that. He's ready now, relaxed and confident that he
can knock that guy out. Now, Evander has a psychological respect
and fear of Lennox.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Holyfield, who did not avoid Lewis' left jab in New York,
conceded that Lewis, 34, is more talented than he thought. ``The
guy has more skills and more movement than I gave him credit for,''
Holyfield said.
</P>
<P>
   As for fearing Lewis, Holyfield could only laugh. ``I fear no
man,'' Holyfield said. ``I'll be there on Nov. 13th. We'll see
then.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he's seen the New York bout about 25 times, and each
viewing only solidifies his expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight will lead to (Holyfield's) retirement,'' Lewis
said. ``When I hit him, he'll know I'm the real deal. He will get
hurt this time. I don't see anything Evander can do. He's never
seen anything like Lennox Lewis. He has no game plan for me. I'm
very confident, especially coming off the last fight. I made a mark
that I'm the real deal and there's no more Evander Holyfield.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' training has dealt mostly with landing power punches that
could stop Holyfield. In their initial encounter, Lewis kept
Holyfield on the end of his long jab but was timid about stepping
in to inflict serious damage. With a second chance, Lewis said, he
will seize a knockout opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have stepped up my pace when I had him hurt in the
fifth round,'' Lewis said. ``I'm going to pick up the pace from the
start (Saturday). If the opportunity presents itself, I'd like to
get rid of him. I don't get paid for overtime.''
</P>
<P>
   All Lewis' bravado and talk aside, he's ``not a bad fighter,''
Don Turner, Holyfield's trainer said. ``But every time Evander
fought him (in March), he ran right through him. He did what he
wanted to do. And Lennox didn't want to fight.''
</P>
<P>
   To this point, that's Lewis' legacy. He beat up on Andrew Golata
and avenged a loss to Oliver McCall and beat Shannon Briggs in a
slug-fest. But Lewis has not done much to generate true excitement
or to raise his name as a respected champion.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield had Bowe, whom he beat two of three times in memorable
battles. Holyfield had Tyson twice; once winning by TKO, the other
by disqualification when Tyson bit his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has _ Holyfield. This is his moment. It ultimately will
define who he is as a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is a really important fight for me,'' Lewis said.
``And I'm going to take advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward was more emphatic. ``The fight will end in a knockout. I
wanted a knockout the first time, but Lennox wanted to show all his
talents, his boxing skills. This time, Lennox is more focused on a
knockout. And for his legacy, he needs it.''

RUNNER-UP IN MEXICO PRIMARY SAYS HE WON'T PROTEST THE RESULT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Roberto Madrazo Pintado, the candidate who
finished second in the governing party's first presidential primary
after a rancorous campaign that had seemed to threaten a party
rupture, acknowledged his defeat on Monday. He said he would not
protest the results of Sunday's balloting, or leave the party.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters just past midnight, Madrazo did not
congratulate the winner, Francisco Labastida Ochoa. But because
Madrazo had repeatedly accused party leaders in the campaign of
displaying favoritism toward Labastida, Madrazo's acceptance of the
outcome amounted to a crucial endorsement of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates who had been equally critical also decided
not to lodge formal protests. One, Humberto Roque Villanueva,
publicly acknowledged Labastida's broad victory. The other
candidate, Manuel Bartlett Diaz, refused to acknowledge his defeat
late on Sunday, and he remained silent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the official results announced on Monday by the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, Labastida won 55 percent of the
9 million votes, a showing that won 273 of the 300 electoral
districts. Madrazo won 29 percent of the votes, Bartlett 6 percent
and Roque 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The primary, which ended the lengthy tradition under which
Mexican presidents have handpicked their successors, attracted
tremendous news coverage, and Madrazo's decision opened the way for
a general closing of ranks in the party, known as the PRI. As a
result, analysts said that the outcome had greatly bolstered the
party's prospects of keeping its long-held presidency in the
election on July 2, when Labastida will face two opposition
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the PRI, this was an extraordinary success,'' said Luis
Rubio, a political scientist who is often critical of the party.
``And Madrazo put the cherry on top at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, a former governor of Tabasco state, campaigned as a
rebel who was defying the party establishment. Even on Sunday
evening, when preliminary results were already showing that
Labastida had won by a landslide, Madrazo appeared to be preparing
to challenge the results.
</P>
<P>
   After television and radio stations broadcast Labastida's
dramatic victory, Madrazo appeared before a few dozen dispirited
followers
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that the vote tendencies are not favorable to
me,'' he said. He spoke of continuing to lead a movement for
democratic change. But aides to Labastida had said before the vote
that if Labastida won, they would offer posts to Madrazo's
followers to seduce them back into the party mainstream. Several
appeared more than willing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We here in Veracruz totally accept Labastida's victory, with
great enthusiasm,'' said Guillermo Zuniga Martinez, Madrazo's
campaign coordinator there.

MARKET PLACE: POSSIBLE MICROSOFT BREAKUP NOT SCARING INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(mk) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A breakup of Microsoft Corp. _ the world's most valuable company
_ appeared somewhat more plausible Monday, following the release
Friday of a federal judge's findings that the government had proved
that the company had a monopoly and had used it to stifle
competition.
</P>
<P>
   But after a weekend of reflection, investors seemed to decide
that even a breakup _ the harshest of possible remedies _ would not
be a disaster for Microsoft shareholders or the stock market. On
Monday, most indexes gained despite Microsoft's fall of $1.625 a
share from Friday's close, which came before the findings were
released. Indeed, Monday's close of $89.9375 was more than the $87
a share reached in after-hours trading Friday, after the findings
were known.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's stock has been an extraordinary performer both
before and after the Justice Department challenge. Indeed, the
stock rose a bit on Oct. 20, 1997, when the department first said
it thought Microsoft was acting illegally. Since then, the stock
has risen 153 percent, and the company now has a market value of
$464 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Microsoft's shares had been somewhat stagnant in recent
weeks as other technology stocks advanced. In a telephone interview
Monday, Greg Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, said he
thought the uncertainty about the findings had been at least as
damaging to the share price as the findings themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous remedies the Justice Department might seek,
and it is not clear yet whether it would push for an extreme course
of action like a breakup. But the two most prominent breakups of
major companies on antitrust grounds _ those of Standard Oil Co. in
1911 and American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph at the end of 1983 _ offer
reassurances for Microsoft holders. Shareholders in both companies
profited greatly in the years following the breakups, as the parts
turned out to be far more valuable than the wholes had been.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that would happen to Microsoft depends both on how the
company would be broken up and on whether the extraordinary
valuation investors now give it would extend to Microsoft's parts.
</P>
<P>
   Two types of breakups have been discussed. The first, and
probably least likely, would create some number of companies to
compete with one another, each with rights to develop and improve
the Windows operating system for personal computers that has been
the core of Microsoft's success.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would immediately create competition in the market,
and could lead to a rapid decline in prices for the system, with
concomitant damage to the share prices of the companies involved.
But as the various companies made their own changes to Windows, the
benefits of standardization would be lost, and that remedy seems
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   The other type of breakup would be along product lines. One
company would maintain responsibility for Windows. Another would
develop and sell the application software, like Microsoft Office.
The third could handle Internet applications.
</P>
<P>
   A section of Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's findings of fact,
to which relatively little attention was paid, may make that kind
of breakup more likely. The judge cited evidence that Microsoft had
charged IBM more for Windows than it had charged other computer
makers, and had offered to cut prices if IBM stopped pushing Lotus
SmartSuite, its rival to Microsoft Office. In the context of his
finding that Microsoft had a monopoly in operating systems, that
could justify a ruling against the company even without the judge's
finding that Microsoft's incorporation of its Internet browser into
its operating system was not made to benefit consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Such a breakup conceivably could be a boon to Microsoft
shareholders. With two of the three new companies dominant in their
areas, and the third perhaps getting an Internet stock valuation,
it is easy to envision a combined value that could be sharply
higher than current levels.
</P>
<P>
   Al Goldman, chief market strategist at AG Edwards in St. Louis,
said, ``The feeling is that Microsoft will survive and that even if
the worst came to pass, the parts would be worth more than the
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Goldman said, ``I think the market is being too
optimistic, because this is a cloud that will hang over Microsoft
for many months.''
</P>
<P>
   The principal question of what the company might be worth is
muddied by the extraordinary valuation Microsoft now commands. It
trades at more than 50 times estimated profit for next year _ a
figure presumably reflecting optimism that Microsoft will keep
growing rapidly and that its profit margins will remain high. In
its last fiscal year, its after-tax profit equaled 39.4 percent of
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   While the stock market on Monday seemed hesitant to conclude
that the judge's findings were particularly bad for Microsoft, it
was willing to bid up the prices of some Microsoft rivals that
might fare better if a court ruling either broke up Microsoft or
restrained what Jackson called the company's use of its
``prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm that
insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify competition
against one of Microsoft's core products.''
</P>
<P>
   America Online, which has merged with Netscape, the maker of the
Internet browser that competes with Microsoft's, rose $4.25 a
share, to $41.25. Red Hat, a distributor of an operating system
that competes with Windows, rose $18.0625 a share, to $104; and Sun
Microsystems, creator of the Java programming language, gained
$2.1875, to $111.875.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's bounceback after trading as low as $84.375 earlier
in the day came on volume of 121.9 million shares, far higher than
normal. David Readerman, an analyst at Thomas Weisel Partners, said
the high volume showed that many investors were reassessing the
company, with some fleeing and others seeing a buying opportunity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most interesting variable, Readerman said, is to what degree
Microsoft itself is buying its shares. ``Microsoft has $18 billion
in cash and marketable securities _ it's like a nation's central
bank defending its currency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, declined to say
whether the company had bought back stock Monday, saying it would
stick to its practice of disclosing those figures quarterly. During
the three months ended Sept. 30, it bought 12.1 million shares.

 &HT;    NFL NOTEBOOK: Car accident led to death in childbirth
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A coroner has ruled that the wife of Indianapolis Colts
defensive back Steve Muhammad died Sunday from excessive bleeding
during labor, caused by injuries in a car accident last week.
</P>
<P>
   Frances Kelly, Marion County's chief deputy coroner, said the
injuries Nichole Muhammad had on her chest and lower abdomen
appeared ``consistent with a steering wheel she hit in an accident
last Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Muhammad was arrested and charged with battering his wife
and their 6-year-old son 10 days before she died while giving birth
to a stillborn child.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Pless, of Indiana University forensics, said the
injuries Mrs. Muhammad received in the alleged attack were to her
back and arm and were ``no bigger than a dime and not
significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple had argued about money at their apartment Oct. 28. A
police report said Muhammad twisted his wife's right wrist behind
her back, pushed her against a wall and threw her to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad then struck his son, Eric, several times after the boy
began striking his father with a yellow plastic baseball bat. The
report added that the player disconnected the telephone when his
wife tried to call 911.
</P>
<P>
   Colts coach Jim Mora, who announced the deaths Sunday after his
team's 25-17 victory over Kansas City, said he spoke to Muhammad on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was struggling, as you would imagine,'' Mora said. ``I
don't think it will be a distraction. I think (the players) are
saddened for Steve and his family, but I don't think they'll be
distracted in preparations for the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts, one game out of first place in the AFC East, visit
the New York Giants this week.
</P>
<P>
   It's Miller time
</P>
<P>
   Chris Miller will make his second start in a row for Denver on
Sunday night in Seattle. This past Sunday, Miller played in his
first-regular season game since Dec. 3, 1995, and led the Broncos
to a 33-17 victory at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Miller completed 14 of 24 passes for 166 yards and avoided the
mistakes that plagued Denver in its six losses this season. Miller,
who retired nearly four years ago after suffering five concussions
in 14 months, called it ``one of the greatest days of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Mike Shanahan said Brian Griese's right shoulder is still
sore and that Bubby Brister will probably miss at least one more
game while nursing a strained oblique muscle and loose cartilage in
his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer's redemption
</P>
<P>
   Former University of Georgia quarterback Eric Zeier's sore ribs
cost him a starting job with Tampa Bay. Trent Dilfer, benched two
weeks ago, completed 15 of 20 passes for 227 yards and three
touchdowns in a 31-16 win at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Tony Dungy said Dilfer will start Sunday against Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, you're a great leader when you win,
and you're a terrible leader when you lose,'' Dilfer said.San
Francisco's dilemma
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco coach Steve Mariucci said he'll decide by
Wednesday whether to start quarterback Jeff Garcia or Steve
Stenstrom on Sunday at New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers, who have lost four games in a row, had only 90
passing yards in their 27-6 loss to Pittsburgh. Garcia, a former
Canadian League star who replaced injured Steve Young, completed
only 7 of 18 attempts for 39 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mariucci said Garcia is leaving the pocket too quickly.
Stenstrom, a former Bears starter, is more of a drop-back passer.
</P>
<P>
   Banks out for season
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville running back Tavian Banks will miss the rest of the
season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Banks was injured late in the fourth quarter of a 30-7 victory
over the Falcons. Atlanta cornerback Ray Buchanan hit Banks after
he had stepped out of bounds on the left sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin said he did not think the hit
was a cheap shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Tavian knew he was out of bounds. I don't think
Buchanan did either,'' Coughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   But some Jaguars players were miffed about the hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was sick,'' running back Fred Taylor said. ``That ain't
right. He was out of bounds. He wasn't trying to run. He was trying
to catch his balance.''

ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS BEGIN TALKS BY STATING POSITIONS 
 (DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Israeli and Palestinian teams sat down
here Monday to begin negotiating a permanent settlement of their
century-old conflict, staking out opposing positions, but promising
to work faithfully to reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be an honor to disagree with you,'' Oded Eran, the
head of the Israeli negotiating team and a former ambassador to
Jordan, told the head of the Palestinian team, Yasser Abed Rabbo.
``But it will be a fulfillment of a life's dream to shake hands
with you at the end of the process and to say, `Brother and
comrade, we did it.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a historical moment for all of us,'' Abed Rabbo, a
minister in the Palestinian cabinet, said after the hour-and-a-half
meeting, which began an intensive effort to negotiate a framework
agreement on a permanent peace by mid-February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that through continuous and extensive work we will
be able to meet the date,'' Abed Rabbo said. ``We started with a
very open and frank atmosphere, without any barriers.''
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, said he would
meet Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel on Tuesday. Both leaders
are in Paris for a meeting of the Socialist International.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Israeli-Palestinian accord, reached in September at
Sharm el-Sheik in Egypt, commits the two sides to try to reach the
framework agreement by Feb. 13 and to conclude a permanent treaty
by September.
</P>
<P>
   The issues to be tackled are the most intractable in the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict, and they were deferred in the 1993
Oslo interim accord. They include the future of Jerusalem,
Palestinian refugees displaced in the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli
wars, Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip,
borders, water and security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   Eran said that because each side was well versed in the other's
positions the ambitious timetable for reaching an accord could be
met.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long road we have to cover in a very short time, but I
believe that through our joint efforts we can make it,'' Eran said.
``After several decades of conflict and negotiations now for almost
six years, all the problems between us are known. There is nothing
that we will learn in another 10 years or 15 years of conflict and
strife. All the issues, all the views, all the opinions are known
to each other. It is not a matter of discovery. It is a matter of
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the cordiality of the first session, the opening
statements restated the sharply conflicting positions that the
sides have long maintained. Although clearly a starting stance by
both sides, the yawning gap between them testified to the hard
bargaining ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo began with a demand for a full Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem to the boundaries
before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. ``Without return by Israel of all
land acquired by war in 1967, including Jerusalem, our efforts will
amount to no more than the deferral of crises,'' he said. ``The
only formula that is acceptable is land for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian ``self-determination,'' a code word for statehood,
is another goal, Abed Rabbo said, as well as ``the right of
Palestinian refugees to return and to receive compensation and
restitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Abed Rabbo demanded an end to the construction and expansion of
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying such
activity predetermined the outcome of the talks. ``We find it
inconceivable and quite contrary to the logic of negotiation to
continue changing facts on the ground,'' he said. In later remarks
to reporters, Abed Rabbo called continued settlement building ``the
main obstacle to progress in our negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Eran named security as Israel's priority, putting it at the top
of a proposed agenda for the talks. But in his remarks he took up
the issue of Jerusalem first.
</P>
<P>
   ``To all Israelis, regardless of their political views,
Jerusalem is our capital, and it should continue to be so,'' he
said. ``Under its sovereignty, Israel has proven its sensitivity to
all religions and to the sanctity of freedom of worship. We
therefore maintain that it should remain united, open and under
Israel's sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders have to be secure, and ``the pre-1967 lines clearly do
not provide for this,'' Eran added.
</P>
<P>
   Alluding to Barak's plan to retain large sections of settlements
under Israeli control, Eran said, ``Establishing secure borders
should equally leave most of the Israelis residing today in the
West Bank and Gaza under Israeli sovereignty.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution of the refugee problem ``cannot be found within the
borders of Israel,'' Eran said. Speaking to reporters, he added
that the solution ``should be based on absorbing the refugees in
their current places of residence'' with an infusion of ``massive
economic aid.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegation heads said their teams would meet here again on
Thursday and hold regular meetings two or three times a week. The
first order of business will be to come up with an agreed agenda.

 &HT;    Weary Falcons to get 4 days off
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Falcons players and coaches got the extra day off they
wanted _ despite losing a game.
</P>
<P>
   After Sunday's 30-7 loss to Jacksonville, coach Dan Reeves
figured that the best medicine for his 2-7 team would be all the
time away from football they can get. The players suggested it
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons will practice Wednesday morning, then players and
coaches will be off Thursday through Sunday in the team's bye week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, they will get just a little bit healthier . . . but
I also think just being away from it for a while may mentally help
everybody, too,'' Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to take a whole different perspective,'' cornerback
Ray Buchanan said. ``Beating us down is probably not going to get
the job done. He said it's not physically that we're losing
football games; it's mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons have made costly mistakes, including the penalty for
illegal blocking that nullified Tim Dwight's 99-yard kickoff return
against Jacksonville. Many of Jacksonville's franchise-record nine
sacks were attributed to blown assignments, and these problems are
causing anxiety in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been with each other since the offseason program (in
late March),'' wide receiver Terance Mathis said. ``It's time to
forget what we've done . . . and go on from here.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves and his staff usually spend Monday reviewing the previous
game before beginning to prepare for the next opponent. Reeves said
coaches will break down tendencies and try to figure out whether
they should scrap certain philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves couldn't remember giving players four days off after a
loss. But in a season in which expectations have been swamped by
frustration, he is willing to try anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, this is probably the most frustrated I've
ever been . . . because I know we are better than what we are
playing,'' he said. ``If I thought working would help (we would
work), but . . . I think it is best just to get away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Count linebacker Henri Crockett among those perplexed about the
Falcons' performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at a loss for words,'' Crockett said. ``We've got 10 guys
doing the right thing, and one guy not doing the right thing almost
every play.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Reeves) made the statement, `We've got to find out who wants
to play.' Everybody has to look in the mirror, myself included, and
just do a gut check. (The time off) should help. It all depends on
how we use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reeves, in fact, cautioned players how to spend their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted us to be smart . . . and keep our bodies in shape,''
Buchanan said. ``He wants us to stay out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   That's another kind of problem the Falcons don't need.

ALUMNUS GIVES $100 MILLION TO MIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a gift that surprised even the giver.
</P>
<P>
   A 58-year-old Cambridge, Mass. software entrepreneur stood up
before officials and his fellow alumni from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology on Saturday night and said he wanted to say
a few words.
</P>
<P>
   In off the cuff remarks, Kenan E. Sahin said he wanted to give
the institute $100 million, which was a cool and spontaneous way of
saying he wanted to make the largest donation in the history of the
school, and one of the 10 largest donations in the history of
higher education.
</P>
<P>
   A self-made billionaire, Sahin was supposed to be giving a
speech in China on Saturday. When the trip was canceled at the last
minute, he decided instead to attend the black tie gala celebrating
the launch of MIT's $1.5 billion fundraising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the sound and light show at the height of the
festivities, he was overwhelmed with gratitude for all the
institute had done for him, and decided that the time had come to
give back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been contemplating some sort of gift, obviously, but
during the dinner, it just seemed the timing was right,'' Sahin
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, college administrators, or at least the president, have
some idea when a donor is about to make a big gift; usually, in
fact, they have worked assiduously for years or months to land it.
</P>
<P>
   But Sahin simply walked over to MIT president Charles Vest at
about 9:15 and said, ``Chuck, I want to say something.'' When Vest
asked ``What is it?'' Sahin refused to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Vest stood up before the 500 guests just finishing their dinners
and introduced the alumnus and former faculty member, saying ``I
really don't know what he's going to say.'' Sahin agreed, ``He
really doesn't know what I'm going to say. Up until a half an hour
ago, I didn't know what I was going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahin recalled how as a student at Robert College in his native
Istanbul, he had a chance conversation with the late Harold Hazen,
a dean at MIT and then-interim president of the Turkish school.
Hazen encouraged him to go to MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Sahin told the curious crowd, ``spontaneous, spur
of the moment conversations have deep, deep consequences. Little
did I know how that would shape my life. I can't tell you how much
I have benefitted from this institution.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he announced the gift.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd rose for a standing ovation that lasted several
minutes, punctuated by the personal thanks of Vest and other MIT
trustees. Only 12 gifts to colleges or universities have ever been
more than $100 million, though ten have been the same amount,
according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my privilege, really,'' Sahin said Monday. ``When one is
fortunate enough to have this kind of wealth, it translates from
hitting the wealth to using it responsibly, in a way that
recognizes what has been given to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting wealth'' began for Sahin with the remark from Hazen,
which led him to MIT, where he got a bachelors degree in 1963 and a
doctorate in 1969. He began his software company, Kenan Systems
Corp., with $1,000, as an MIT faculty member in 1982. In 1986,
after 16 years on the faculty, he left to run the company full
time, creating software that was quickly used by most major
telecommunications companies for billing and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry famous for brash entrepreneurs, he was the quiet
one, remaining the sole owner and never sending out press releases
announcing his successes.
</P>
<P>
   And his successes have been many, culminating in January, when
Lucent Technologies bought his company for $1.45 billion in stock _
which all went to Sahin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been, all day and at the gala, listening to some of the
best minds at MIT and what they were doing and predicting for the
future. I wanted to be a significant contributor to MIT, which
inevitably will shape the thinking about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift is unusual for a reason other than its sheer magnitude
and surprise: it is also unrestricted, meaning that it can be spent
on anything the university deems fit. Most donors, by contrast,
restrict their gifts to go to buildings or things with their names
on them. Sahin set up a committee, of himself, Vest, former MIT
presidents Howard Johnson and Paul Gray, and Teledyne founder Alex
D'Arbeloff, to decide how best to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gift from the heart, and one that represents a
belief in the importance of what MIT is and will be,'' Vest, who
was traveling in England, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson called Sahin a ``classic American success story'' _ and
also suggested that maybe MIT shouldn't have been so surprised at
his gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always interested in moving beyond what most people
expected, even what most people imagined.'' Johnson said. ``His
talents were matched by a kind of daring and tenacity that have led
to remarkable success. And yet, there is a kind of modesty and
quiet dignity about him.''

HOSPITALS LAGGING BEHIND IN UTILIZING DEFIBRILLATORS, STUDY SHOWS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many people think a hospital is a giant, emergency
medical service unit _ the ideal place to be if they suffer sudden
cardiac arrest. But it's not.
</P>
<P>
   A study out Monday suggests that hospitals need to follow the
example of casinos, airports and shopping malls by training and
equipping non-emergency personnel with easy-to-use automatic
external defibrillators, or AEDs.
</P>
<P>
   When cardiac arrest occurs, the heart often goes into a state of
fibrillation, or chaotic rhythm, resulting in a quivering,
ineffective muscle. Pumping stops, depriving organs of vital blood
flow. For every minute that passes, survival is reduced by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 270,000 people who experience cardiac arrest each year,
only an estimated 1 to 5 percent survive. Although cardiopulmonary
resuscitation can keep a minimal amount of blood flowing to the
heart, early defibrillation _ an electric shock that can restore
the heart to its normal rhythm _ is considered the single most
important step in saving the lives of cardiac arrest victims.
</P>
<P>
   Broader use of AEDs in public settings by firefighters, police
or other first response teams has resulted in increased survival
for people who suffer sudden cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals are lagging way behind in utilizing this data,''
said Dr. Mary Ann Peberdy, an assistant professor of medicine at
Medical College of Virginia, speaking at the American Heart
Association meeting in Atlanta. While survival rates for
out-of-hospital heart attacks have improved thanks to AED use, she
said, survival rates for in-hospital heart attacks have remained
stagnant for the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, defibrillation required a lot of training and its
use was limited to doctors. Many studies showed that patients who
suffered cardiac arrest in the hospital had to wait five minutes or
more for a doctor to perform the procedure, Peberdy said.
</P>
<P>
   Peberdy and her colleagues decided to see what would happen if
non-critical care nurses at one hospital were trained to use AEDs.
</P>
<P>
   Over a five-year period, 210 cardiac arrests were recorded at
Miriam Hospital in Rhode Island. The nurse team treated 36 percent
of those patients versus 64 percent treated by the conventional
hospital team.
</P>
<P>
   The results were striking: More patients (69 percent) got
defibrillation in less than one minute by the nurse team versus the
group treated by conventional hospital teams.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers also found a trend toward higher survival rates
among those treated by the nurse team. Forty-five percent of
cardiac arrest victims treated by the nurse team lived to be
discharged from the hospital, versus 31 of patients treated the
traditional way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is our hope that hospitals will incorporate this,'' Peberdy
said. ``We hope this time next year we won't have to ask if we'd
rather have a heart attack in a casino, or in a hospital setting.``
</P>
<P>
   Battery-powered and about the size of a lunch box, the devices
cost about $3,000 and come with voice prompts and paddles with
illustrations that show where on the body to place the paddles.
Training takes about four hours, and one small Seattle study
demonstrated that even sixth-graders could be taught to use the
device.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Groh of Indiana University School of Medicine said
AEDs have a built-in safety feature, a sensor that detects an
abnormal heart rhythm. The device will not deliver a jolt of
electricity unless it's appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   A study reported Monday by Groh showed that the cost of the
devices over five years works out to about $4,400 per life saved.
The study looked at nine communities, where a total of 268 AEDs
were distributed to firefighters and police through a grant
program.

CLINTON SENDS TWO TOP AIDES TO BEIJING TO WORK ON TRADE ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a long Saturday-night telephone call with
President Jiang Zemin of China, President Clinton sent his trade
representative and his top economic adviser to Beijing on Monday in
an effort to close a deal that would bring China into the World
Trade Organization in return for a wide-ranging opening of its
markets to American-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which Clinton dispatched Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky and Gene Sperling, who heads the National
Economic Council _ and who was among those who advised Clinton to
walk away from a huge trade deal with China in April _ suggested
that the administration now believes that an agreement may be
within reach.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it would mark one of the most important accords with
China since the resumption of diplomatic relations with the country
two decades ago. It would also give Clinton a long-sought foreign
policy accomplishment: a claim to have helped integrate the world's
most populous nation into the global economy, putting it under the
rule of international law with an accord that could also spur
China's faltering economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the White House would not publicly discuss Clinton's
conversation with Jiang, and on Sunday White House officials even
denied it had taken place. Clinton has insisted on a veil of
secrecy around the delicate negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But one official close to the negotiations, insisting on
anonymity, said that Clinton and other top officials had a hard
time evaluating Jiang's intentions during the conversation on
Saturday. While the Chinese leader agreed to receive Clinton's
delegation, it was unclear whether he was ready to overcome the
political opposition in China to opening the country's markets _
including allowing American firms to invest heavily in
telecommunications, finance and other Chinese industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things didn't sound as positive as we would like,'' the
official said. ``It was kind of right down the middle and so we
decided that there was very little to lose in trying'' to go and
strike the deal. Another official said ``there seemed to have been
enough there to make it worth the effort. But the fact is they
don't know exactly what they are headed into.''
</P>
<P>
   In a previous call with Jiang, on Oct. 16, Clinton offered to
put together a ``bottom line'' offer _ a description of what China
must do in order to get into the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably that includes resolving existing disagreements on
telecommunications, financial services, textiles and Washington's
rights to unilaterally impose sanctions if it believes that China
is dumping its exports in the United States. The last point is a
critical one for Vice President Al Gore, who has been under
tremendous pressure from American labor unions _ which have opposed
a WTO deal with China _ not to give up the right to slap punitive
tariffs on low-cost Chinese steel, textiles and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's team does not have much time to reach the enormously
complex agreement _ which would entail hundreds of pages of trade
concessions by China _ before the world's trade ministers gather in
Seattle at the end of this month. That meeting gives Clinton some
negotiating leverage, because if it is clear that China is about to
enter the WTO, Beijing will be able to play a role in setting the
agenda for the next global round of trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is under pressure, too. The World Trade
Organization's legitimacy is vastly reduced if one of the world's
biggest trading nations is not included.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is clearly sensitive about the criticism that he missed
a huge diplomatic moment with China last April, when Prime Minister
Zhu Rongji arrived in Washington with an offer to open China's
markets that impressed American business executives with its
breadth and depth. Clinton's own advisers have said he was focused
on other things at the time _ notably the war over Kosovo _ and
feared that Congress would reject China's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The president commented on that decision for the first time last
week. ``A lot of people have said we had an agreement in April and
that we walked away from it because there was opposition from the
American labor movement,'' he said. ``I've read that a hundred
times. That is absolutely not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday Clinton said little about his weekend decision to send
Ms. Barshefsky, accompanied by Sperling, who would ordinarily have
spent the week in last-minute budget negotiations with Congress.
Asked to rate the chances of striking a deal, the president said,
``I don't know but I hope so. Ambassador Barshefsky and Mr.
Sperling have gone over there to work on it and we're doing our
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Sending along Sperling may send two different political messages
simultaneously, one to the Chinese and another to labor and other
opponents of the deal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials clearly feel mistreated by the White House's
handling of Zhu's visit, and they know that Sperling, along with
Robert E. Rubin, who was then Treasury secretary, thought the deal
could not be sold to Congress. His appearance alongside Ms.
Barshefsky _ who had urged Clinton to accept the deal with China,
with some amendments _ is a sign that she and the White House are
now on the same wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Sperling is more attuned to the mood of
Congress and labor. ``The thinking is that Gene's more inclined to
protect Clinton and Gore politically,'' one of his associates said
Monday.

   The crowd rose for a standing ovation that lasted several
minutes, punctuated by the personal thanks of Vest and other MIT
trustees. Only 12 gifts to colleges or universities have ever been
more than $100 million, though ten have been the same amount,
according to the Chronicle of Higher Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my privilege, really,'' Sahin said Monday. ``When one is
fortunate enough to have this kind of wealth, it translates from
hitting the wealth to using it responsibly, in a way that
recognizes what has been given to you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting wealth'' began for Sahin with the remark from Hazen,
which led him to MIT, where he got a bachelors degree in 1963 and a
doctorate in 1969. He began his software company, Kenan Systems
Corp., with $1,000, as an MIT faculty member in 1982. In 1986,
after 16 years on the faculty, he left to run the company full
time, creating software that was quickly used by most major
telecommunications companies for billing and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry famous for brash entrepreneurs, he was the quiet
one, remaining the sole owner and never sending out press releases
announcing his successes.
</P>
<P>
   And his successes have been many, culminating in January, when
Lucent Technologies bought his company for $1.45 billion in stock _
which all went to Sahin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been, all day and at the gala, listening to some of the
best minds at MIT and what they were doing and predicting for the
future. I wanted to be a significant contributor to MIT, which
inevitably will shape the thinking about the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The gift is unusual for a reason other than its sheer magnitude
and surprise: it is also unrestricted, meaning that it can be spent
on anything the university deems fit. Most donors, by contrast,
restrict their gifts to go to buildings or things with their names
on them. Sahin set up a committee, of himself, Vest, former MIT
presidents Howard Johnson and Paul Gray, and Teledyne founder Alex
D'Arbeloff, to decide how best to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a gift from the heart, and one that represents a
belief in the importance of what MIT is and will be,'' Vest, who
was traveling in England, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson called Sahin a ``classic American success story'' _ and
also suggested that maybe MIT shouldn't have been so surprised at
his gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always interested in moving beyond what most people
expected, even what most people imagined.'' Johnson said. ``His
talents were matched by a kind of daring and tenacity that have led
to remarkable success. And yet, there is a kind of modesty and
quiet dignity about him.''

   INDIA: TALKS CANCELED
</P>
<P>
   The government has forced the postponement of a seven-nation
summit meeting planned for Nov. 26-28 in Nepal. India, the largest
member of the South Asia Association for Regional Cooperation,
objected to taking part in the meeting because of the recent
military takeover in neighboring Pakistan. No new date for the
conference has been set.
</P>
<P>
   PAKISTAN: NUCLEAR VOW
</P>
<P>
   In his first news conference since joining the new military
government as foreign minister, Abdul Sattar promised that Pakistan
would never be the first to conduct any further tests of nuclear
weapons. He said the nation ``cannot afford'' an arms race and
``nor is it necessary.'' Meanwhile, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, who now
controls the country, has left on a trip to Qatar, Turkey and
Kuwait.

   In an attempt to bring new impulse to stalled compensation talks
for slave laborers under the Nazis, the government offered to
contribute an additional $550 million to a Holocaust restitution
fund. The latest pledge is intended to put pressure on German
industry to raise its offer to $3.2 billion from its current $2.1
billion.

   NORTHERN IRELAND: MITCHELL RETURNS
</P>
<P>
   George Mitchell returned to Belfast for the 11th week of his
mission to try to break the deadlock over putting the terms of the
Northern Ireland peace accord into place. The former senator spent
the past week briefing President Clinton and the prime ministers of
Britain and Ireland, Tony Blair and Bertie Ahern, on the chances of
success of his effort, expected to end this week.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE: LEFTISTS MEET

<P>
   European leftist leaders, in power in 11 of the European Union's
15 member states, met in Paris for the Socialist International's
21st congress to discuss new formulas for dealing with today's
issues. Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said the center-left
must ``jettison outdated doctrine and dogma that stands in our
way.'' But France's prime minister, Lionel Jospin, said capitalism
``must be constantly controlled and regulated.''

   KUWAIT: VOTE ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait's all-male Parliament is expected to vote Tuesday on
whether to allow women a right to vote. The poll would be the first
major test of a decree last spring by the country's Emir, Sheik
Jaber Sabah, that would extend voting rights to women. Members of
the legislature have argued that the emir's decree represents an
overreaching of his powers, but some liberals among them have
warned that Kuwait's foreign relations might be harmed if the plan
is rejected.

<P>
   ISRAEL: A REACTOR DEATH
</P>
<P>
   The Atomic Energy Commission, which rarely makes public
statements and almost never refers to its nuclear reactor in
Dimona, sent out an unusual beeper message. It said it ``regrets
that today at noon an employee died in a 12-foot fall while
preparing scaffolding for a welding job at the Nuclear Research
Center in the Negev.'' The commission may have been seeking to
curtail speculation about the cause of death if the fact of it
emerged.

FATE OF RAYTHEON CONSTRUCTION UNIT IN THE AIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. Monday backed off assurances it will keep a
Cambridge, Mass. construction unit that builds power plants and
refineries, stepping back from another ambitious goal set by its
new chief executive Daniel Burnham a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham also plans to reorganize Raytheon's big defense unit in
Virginia, a move that will likely diminish the influence of the top
executive there, sources familiar with the matter said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes are the latest steps at the Lexington, Mass. defense
contractor as it struggles to regain its financial footing after a
string of disappointing announcements, culminating in charges for
1999 of about $638 million.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures, announced last month, sent Raytheon's shares
plummetting to half of what they were worth last July and
foreshadowed renewed rounds of layoffs including up to 300 workers
in Quincy, Mass. There Raytheon plans to close a microelectronics
plant that has operted in the city for decades.
</P>
<P>
   The engineers &AMP; constructors unit in Cambridge recently has
become a thorn in Raytheon's side. The segment once was a cash cow
for Raytheon, drawing contracts to build many of the country's
nuclear power plants. But a series of acquisitions begun in 1993
have failed to pay off, partly because of pressures to hold down
the costs of large-scale industrial building projects.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the unit reported a loss of $253 million on revenue
of $2 billion, and it laid off about 1,600 people. The unit's
performance has suffered lately as well, reporting an operating
loss of $115 million on sales of $659 for the three months ended
Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   After taking over as chief executive last year, Burnham brushed
aside suggestions the unit should be sold and said it could be
reorganized and made profitable again. Late last week, a Raytheon
representative said that position remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday spokesman David Polk said of the unit that parent
Raytheon is ``looking at its fit in our portfolio.'' Polk declined
to say if any talks were under way to sell the unit, or to comment
on a published report in the Wall Street Journal that said the
company is seeking a buyer. Neither Burnham nor Shea Assad, the
head of the unit, was available to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts who follow the engineering business say they would not
be surprised if the company sold the unit. ``We've heard for a
while that this wasn't core to the operation,'' said Tobias
Levkovich, construction industry analyst for Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers for the unit include Morrisson Knudsen Corp. of
Boise, Idaho, Swiss-based ABB and Japan's Mitsubishi Group,
industry observers said. Officials at all three companies declined
to comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Raytheon also plans to reorganize its defense unit
in Virginia, according to sources familiar with the matter. The
changes weren't expected to result in new charges or layoffs, the
source said.
</P>
<P>
   But the changes will likely reduce the influence of William
Swanson, who had been head of the division previously known as
Raytheon Systems Co. The unit last year accounted for about $15
million of Raytheon's company's $20 million in revenue.
</P>
<P>
   That name will be dropped and the divisions that made it up will
now report individually to Burnham. Swanson will stay to oversee a
sensors and defense-systems divisions, at the same level as three
executives he had previously overseen. Swanson was not available to
comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Another executive who once reported to Swanson, Ken Dahlberg,
now will also report to Burnham, the sources said.

CARDIOLOGY RESEARCH FOCUSES ON PLAQUE IN ARTERIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LEIGH HOPPER 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The ability to identify pieces of plaque in arteries
that may break off and cause heart attack or stroke is one of the
most intriguing new areas of research in cardiology _ and the
outgrowth of a discovery made three years ago in the Texas Medical
Center in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the thing that's been missing from our ability to
identify patients most at risk for heart attack and stroke,'' said
Dr. James Willerson, chief of cardiology at the Texas Heart
Institute. ``To be able to detect a vulnerable plaque is very
important.``
</P>
<P>
   Willerson, editor of the medical journal Circulation, is
attending the American Heart Association meeting this week in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Most patients who have a heart attack or stroke have had a
change in their plaque.
</P>
<P>
   Plaque is the thick, hard deposit of cholesterol that cakes up
on artery linings. Sometimes a piece of plaque ruptures and breaks
off, blocking a blood vessel. The result is often a heart attack or
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Willerson, working with his partner, cardiologist Dr. Ward
Casscells, observed that this happened 50 percent of the time in
arteries that weren't significantly narrowed, and therefore weren't
considered a threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd usually leave them alone,'' he said. ``But they're
dangerous ... We need to know about plaques themselves, regardless
of narrowing.``
</P>
<P>
   The doctors began noting temperature variations in the pieces of
plaque they removed from patients with blocked neck arteries. Using
a hand-held thermometer with a pinlike tip, they could measure
temperatures throughout a piece of plaque. What they discovered was
that the plaque had different temperatures in different spots and
at the site most likely to rupture the temperature was slightly
higher.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists are building catheters capable of heat detection
to pinpoint these unstable areas of plaque before they break off.
Doctors in Greece have confirmed the Houston findings using such an
instrument. Willerson hopes to start clinical trials in Houston of
a similar device.
</P>
<P>
   Willerson said that because many people with unstable plaque
have no symptoms of heart disease, it is important to develop
noninvasive ways of detecting the potential killer.
</P>
<P>
   A reactive protein found in veins may indicate the presence of
unstable plaque, but it doesn't give a specific location, Willerson
said. But unstable plaque has distinct physical characteristics
that might permit doctors to spot troublesome areas with magnetic
resonance imaging. The plaque that is likely to rupture has a thin,
fibrous cap, with inflamed cells beneath it, and a core of lipids,
or fats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, they're dangerous and this is the first way
we've had to predict them,'' Willerson said. ``This is about
predicting risk of heart attack before it occurs.``

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS CLIMB AGAIN DESPITE MICROSOFT FINDINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-MARKETPLACE) 
(mk) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology stocks on Monday shrugged off the stinging
judicial rebuke delivered to Microsoft last Friday and surged to a
seventh consecutive record.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is insatiable demand right now,'' said Michael Clark,
head of U.S. stock trading for Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand fully where all the demand is coming
from,'' Clark added, ``but for the first time in months we are
seeing people thinking beyond the first of the year and acting on
those thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Led by some of Microsoft's major competitors, including Apple
Computer and Sun Microsystems, the NASDAQ composite index rose
41.68 points, or 1.3 percent, to 3,143.97.
</P>
<P>
   But gains in technology stocks were not limited to those who are
likely beneficiaries of the court case against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco Systems, which is expected to release its third-quarter
earnings after the market closes Tuesday, and Lucent Technologies
helped to pull the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index up by 6.78 points,
or 0.5 percent, to 1,377.01.
</P>
<P>
   And the Dow Jones industrial average managed to rise 14.37
points, or 0.1 percent, to 10,718.85, aided by gains in Exxon, IBM
and Proctor &AMP; Gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Worries persisted through the weekend that Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson's findings of fact in the government's antitrust case
against Microsoft would not only hammer Microsoft, but could drag
down the entire technology sector. Those worries proved unfounded
and analysts and traders said they were surprised with how well
Microsoft fared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured Microsoft would be down at least 10 points,'' said
Philip Dow, a managing director in equity research at Dain Rauscher
Wessels in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the thinking seems to be that if the Justice Department
ultimately breaks it up, the parts will be worth more than the
whole company.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Microsoft was the most actively traded stock
Monday, with 122 million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
   The stock was sharply lower during the day, but rallied as the
session progressed and closed at 89 15/16, down 1 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors rewarded a number of Microsoft's most
vigorous competitors and critics.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems gained 2 3/16, to 111 7/8. Oracle, the world's
largest maker of database software, gained 3/4, to 59 7/16. And Red
Hat Inc., developer of an operating system that competes with
Microsoft's Windows, jumped 18 1/8, to 104.
</P>
<P>
   Away from the technology sector, Monday was a good day in the
oil patch.
</P>
<P>
   Exxon gained 3 11/16, to 74 5/16. BP Amoco, which reported a 72
percent increase in third-quarter profit Monday, gained 3 7/16, to
55 3/4. Mobil was up 5 5/8, to 97. And Royal Dutch/Shell closed at
57 5/8, up 2.
</P>
<P>
   Monday was not a good day for Providian Financial, however.
</P>
<P>
   The credit card company slumped 26 1/4, to 89 1/4, after it said
the Connecticut attorney general was investigating the way it
issues cards and bills customers. The investigation is the latest
in a list of legal inquiries that have been piling up for months.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wholesale gains in technology shares, market breadth
was negative, with more stocks falling in price than rising. And
trading volume was moderate.
</P>
<P>
   On the New York Stock Exchange, 802.4 million shares were
traded. On the NASDAQ stock market, 1.29 billion shares changed
hands.

<P>
   When Neiko Fischbein watched television she got ``overcranked.''
No matter what, she could not sit still. ``She just seemed to be
attracted, or distracted, by everything in constant fashion,'' said
Dr. Ellen Fischbein, a psychiatrist who lives outside of New Haven.
``I'm kind of a high-energy person, but she exhausted me.''
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting attention deficit disorder, Dr. Fischbein took her
3{-year-old to see a behavior specialist, who concurred and
prescribed Dexedrine. Within two days, Dr. Fischbein had witnessed
a complete transformation in Neiko: ``It was like somebody had
virtually turned a dial.''
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, Neiko Fischbein is a Rottweiler.
</P>
<P>
   And just like humans, they sometimes need psychiatric help. Dr.
Nicholas Dodman, who prescribed Neiko's Dexedrine, is a leader in
the small but growing field of animal psychology, where many of the
current controversies echo eerily similar debates in the field of
human behavior. And while psychologists have drawn lessons from
animals since Pavlov's experiments a century ago, insights now are
flowing in both directions.
</P>
<P>
   The American Veterinary Medicine Association began to recognize
animal behavior as a board-certified specialty in 1993, and since
then, only 20 veterinarians, including Dodman, have earned the
certification. An animal behavior specialist at Tufts University,
Dodman is a co-author of the only veterinary textbook on the use of
psychopharmaceuticals in animals and has written several popular
books on behavior, including ``Dogs Behaving Badly'' (Bantam, 1999)
and ``The Cat Who Cried for Help'' (Bantam, 1997).
</P>
<P>
   But many others are hanging out shingles, from PhDs in
psychology to dog trainers, and they charge up to $250 as hour,
with telephone follow-ups). Other signs of the field's growth
abound. In January, the Food and Drug Administration officially
approved the use of two human psychopharmaceuticals, Clomicalm and
Anipryl, for mental problems in dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Novartis, which makes Clomicalm, an anti-anxiety drug, expects
it to produce $25 million a year in animal sales.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the 29 veterinary schools in the United States now
offer residency programs in animal behavior. The Tufts University
Veterinary Center has started a fax-back service for pet owners who
cannot wait the three months to see Dodman.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in human psychology, many diagnoses and treatments are
controversial. Ian Dunbar, a psychologist and puppy training expert
in Berkeley, Calif., says that when he asks an owner about a dog's
annoying behaviors, he expects to hear about problems like chewing,
barking or escaping. But more and more, he said, ``people have
developed big names for mythical syndromes: things like separation
anxiety syndrome.'' He added: ``I just disagree with that. Dogs are
dogs and they do doggy things.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunbar, who believes in positive-reinforcement, for dogs and
children, takes umbrage at the idea of ``separation anxiety'' in
pets. He argues that dogs that chew or bark or otherwise behave
badly when their owners leave are usually just cutting loose. ``The
dog learns it's simply bad news to act like a dog when the owners
are around,'' he said. Rather than getting a psychoactive drug, he
argues, pets need reward-based training in how to deal with
confinement.
</P>
<P>
   David Falk, an Airedale trainer based in Corinth, N.Y., agrees
that ``separation anxiety'' is just a word for boredom. ``They're
bored,'' he said. ``They tear your house apart. Are they bored
because you're gone? Or are they bored because they're bored?''
</P>
<P>
   Animal behavior specialists will probably always have to wrestle
with the accusation that they attributing human traits to animals.
But Dodman points out that sometimes a human diagnosis is as
controversial as a canine one; when it comes to attention deficit
disorder, for example, the British ``think Americans are crazy and
are overdosing their children'' with stimulants like Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in animals as in humans, he said, a conspicuous change in
activity level indicates a diagnosable condition. Give the creature
Ritalin or Dexedrine, and if it experiences the paradoxical
response of calming down, as Neiko did, the diagnosis is confirmed,
Dodman said.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers are among the most skeptical of assigning human
conditions to pets. Most pet behavior problems, they believe, stem
from either inappropriate human expectations or lack of training.
``A lot of these dogs are hard-wired for specific behaviors,'' said
Brian Kilcommons, co-author of the book ``Paws to Consider''
(Warner Books, 1999), adding that many owners picked breeds that
were entirely unsuited for their lifestyles. ``They buy a
Weimaraner because it's an attractive, handsome dog,'' he said.
``They don't do their homework. You have to run this dog, at least
two hours a day of hard running.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Richmond, co-executive director of the Humane Society of
New York, says many dogs are labeled bad because they do not have
the opportunity to run off energy while the owners are at work.
``It would be like telling a 4-year-old to sit at a desk for 10
hours,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dodman agrees that some odd dog behaviors do stem from modern
circumstances. He once had to euthanize a bull terrier named Teddy
when nothing would stop the dog from frantically chasing its tail.
Years later, a colleague pointed out that bull terriers were bred
as predators, specifically to kill rats.
</P>
<P>
   Many tail chasers, Dodman now believes, are simply pursuing the
``only potential prey'' in their environments. He treats them with
Prozac.
</P>
<P>
   As in human psychology, many problems can be alleviated through
a combination of retraining and psychopharmacology. Take
thunderstorm phobia, a common canine fear. Dr. Peter Borchelt, a
pet behavior expert in Brooklyn, N.Y., who has a PhD in psychology,
uses thunderstorm recordings and strobe lights to desensitize
fearful pets. When that fails, he may recommend anti-anxiety
medication.
</P>
<P>
   Among the lessons that can be learned from pet psychology are
what makes good parents. ``That's the real importance of all this
puppy stuff,'' Dunbar said. ``There are three species in the world
which are regularly abused: dogs, horses and humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bonnie Beaver, a member of the executive board of Veterinary
Medicine Group AVMA, says that while many of the links between
animal and human psychology are speculative, this much is certain:
``People who are physically abusive of animals have a high
probability of physical abuse to people.'' In some jurisdictions,
animal-abuse authorities share information with child-abuse
agencies, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite obvious connections between animals and humans in terms
of brain chemistry and behavior modification, there are areas of
human psychology where pets will probably never tread. Do not
expect Fido or Whiskers to be sharing their dreams anytime soon _
even though Dobermans are used by sleep researchers at Stanford to
study narcolepsy.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dr. Beaver, who is also a professor at Texas A&AMP;M
University, does not think animal behaviorists are years behind
their human counterparts, she does concede that she and her
colleagues must sometimes draw on insights from human psychology.
``Because,'' she explained, ``we can't talk to our clients.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sipping coffee in his office, Robert Ayling seemed
relaxed for a chief executive whose job is in peril, if you believe
the reports in the British press and the whispering around water
coolers in London's financial district.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling, chief executive of British Airways PLC, had even taken
off his shoes during a recent interview, as though he were settling
in for a long flight.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed skeptics who have assailed British Airways' dismal
financial performance and have questioned his unusual plan to
reverse it by reducing the market share of his airline, Europe's
largest.
</P>
<P>
   ``That always cheers me up when people say, `Nobody else is
doing this,''' he said, ``because you can be absolutely sure that
if you're just going along with the herd you're likely to be
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayling, 52, is not one to follow the herd. But on Monday, as the
company reported that its fiscal second-quarter earnings had fallen
86 percent, it was not clear that his approach was working.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling insists that the airline's finances will strengthen in
the coming year. He recently introduced a new team of executives
whose average age is 44 _ ``to give the place some energy,'' he
said. He is also planning some major innovations next year, notably
beds in business class for long-haul flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``No manager loves to report bad trading figures,'' he said.
``But if we hadn't figured out why this was happening and we hadn't
figured out what we should do about it, I would be very worried.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Ayling said, ``we saw this coming. Three years
ago, we knew there would be a profit freeze and we announced to the
world we were going to take about 1 billion pounds ($1.62 billion)
worth of cost out of the business that then had a turnover of about
8 billion pounds. People said we were crazy. Nobody says that
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, analysts say that British Airways' chances for recovery
are promising, but the airline's troubled past still unnerves some
investors, an anxiety that may be justified.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ayling became British Airways' chief executive in the
first month of 1996, the company has suffered a series of setbacks
that cast doubt on his ability to manage the former state-owned
airline.
</P>
<P>
   A once-heralded alliance between British Air and American
Airlines that he personally negotiated has embarrassingly failed
amid regulators' objections.
</P>
<P>
   A strike in 1997 by cabin crews cost the airline $200 million,
and a plan to repaint the fleet's tail fins with international
designs backfired after the British public protested, demanding the
return of the Union Jack. This cost the company not only money but
also some of its self-proclaimed reputation as ``the world's
favorite airline.''
</P>
<P>
   The earnings figures released Monday, while largely expected,
did little to ease investors' apprehension. Earnings for the
quarter ending on Sept. 30 totaled 30 million pounds, or $48.6
million, down from 216 million pounds a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, citing trans-Atlantic fare discounting, said
six-month earnings fell 37.2 percent to 218 million pounds, and it
expects to report an annual loss this fiscal year for the first
time since the airline was privatized in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways shares, which have fallen 41 percent since April
to six-year lows, ended in London on Monday at 3.3075 pounds, or
$5.36, up less than a penny.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ayling is putting his own, somewhat diminished, reputation on
the line as he tries to remake the airline. He is reducing its
overall passenger capacity by 12 percent in an effort to weed out
the low-cost fares and cater more to first- and business-class
passengers who pay fares that are far higher and push profit
margins up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy segment of our business has become so
uncompetitive that the airlines of the world today are competing
for passengers at prices that barely, barely cover their on-the-day
operating costs,'' Ayling said. ``It's economic madness.''
</P>
<P>
   The airline industry has been plagued in recent years by a
problem it euphemistically calls ``overcapacity'' _ too many seats
for too few passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian economic crisis that began in 1997 worsened the
problem by reducing the number of fliers to and from Asia. Many
carriers responded by moving their largest aircraft from Asia
routes to the North Atlantic, hoping to find customers where the
economy was still healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But the addition to fleets of new, large planes created even
more capacity, driving down profit margins for coach-class
passengers to single digits and in some cases, losses. British
Airways has not been the only airline affected; last week, KLM said
its quarterly earnings decreased 57 percent in the recent quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average fare is in long-term real decline,'' said Chris
Avery, an airline analyst at J.P. Morgan in London. ``It's a
fundamentally declining-yield industry. You have a massive pressure
between a declining unit revenue and rising unit cost. Airlines
have perennial trouble sorting that conundrum out.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer of Ayling and his new management team _ increasing
the number of business-class seats while decreasing its market
share _ is novel. ``British Airways has broken the traditional mold
of the airline industry,'' said Chris Tarry, an analyst at
Commerzbank in London. ``It is repositioning itself and will emerge
structurally and significantly more profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts agree, and despite the company's poor performance,
several have upgraded their rating of the company. A report from
J.P. Morgan suggests that British Airways is the first stock to buy
for the cyclical upturn.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts applaud its focus on more profitable customers,
questions remain about whether there are enough business passengers
willing to pay a premium and whether the airline's profit margins
on business-class fares will be driven down by competition.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling acknowledges the potential problem. ``Even if there is
pressure, and I accept that there may well be pressure, on the
yields that come from the premium segment, they will always be
better than the yields you get from transfer economy segments,'' he
said, referring to coach passengers who transfer to connecting
flights, generally the least profitable.
</P>
<P>
   He also predicted that once the airline introduces beds in
business class _ ``the feel is like the inside of a really good
executive car'' _ travelers will no longer be comparing airlines
simply by the cost of the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts agree. ``For those corporate fliers that have
choice,'' Avery said, ``the prospect of a bed vs. a reclining seat
on a red-eye to Europe from the States becomes a little bit of a
no-brainer. All things being equal, you will go for the bed and
have a good night's sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Ayling's own forecast about his future on the job, he
said he's ``staying put, thank you very much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I shall leave when I'm 60,'' he said, ``and not before.''

PIZZA RUN ENDS `BLACK WIDOW' MURDER SUSPECT'S FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANNA WEISS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ She ran from murder charges for nearly three years,
mastered disguises and aliases, wove a tortured path from Las Vegas
to Mexico to Massachusetts _ and met her undoing at the hands of a
pizza delivery man.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Domino's worker who told police he had recognized
Margaret Rudin _ accused of shooting and beheading her fifth
husband in Las Vegas _ in Revere, just outside Boston, Friday
night. And it was a police officer, disguised in a Domino's uniform
and bearing a pizza box, who knocked on the apartment door shortly
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   When police went in, they found Rudin in the bathroom, wearing a
black wig, the door closed, the lights off. She gave up without a
fight. Police say she seemed almost relieved.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sudden, almost comical end to a murder investigation
that began with her husband's death on Dec. 18, 1994, and ended
with the help of tipsters who saw the twisted story on ``America's
Most Wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudin, 56, arraigned Monday, told her lawyer she plans to fight
extradition to Las Vegas. But police say it's a matter of time
before she faces a jury there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get her back here,'' said Lt. Wayne Petersen of the Las
Vegas Metropolitan Police homicide squad. ``It'll just take a
little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been a long wait already since the day when Ron Rudin, a
Las Vegas real estate developer worth some $10 million, was shot in
his bed, loaded into an antique trunk, decapitated, burned, and
tossed in a remote spot near the Colorado River. Margaret Rudin,
his pretty, petite fifth wife of seven years, filed a missing
person report. Fishermen found her husband's body more than a month
later.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the body was found, friends of the couple had told
police they suspected his wife, Petersen said. But it wasn't until
two years later, he said, after police found physical evidence that
linked Margaret Rudin to the crime, that she was charged.
</P>
<P>
   Before a grand jury could indict her, she disappeared; tipsters
spotted her in Phoenix, Chicago and Guadalajara, Mexico. It was
there, in Mexico, that she met Joseph Lundergan, a retired
Boston-area firefighter.
</P>
<P>
   And it was there that, in stages, she told him the strange tale
he came to believe wholeheartedly: that she was wrongly accused and
fleeing for her life, from an evil Israeli terrorist named Yehuda,
who was ``in cahoots'' with the trustees of her late husband's
estate.
</P>
<P>
   Rudin first identified herself as Marie, said Lundergan, 61, a
youngish-looking man with gray-blond hair and a measured way of
talking. She gave a last name, four or five syllables long, that he
couldn't recall, he said. They lived in the same apartment building
in Guadalajara, where he had moved while he awaited an insurance
settlement for an injured knee.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the pretty younger woman ``was in the background,'' he
said. ``We didn't date or anything. Just, `Hi, how are you.' '' He
busied himself with Mexican women, who he said ``love American
men.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, they started to take meals together, he said. When
he asked her what she was doing in Mexico, ``she didn't give me a
direct answer at first.'' But eventually, a story came out. She
said she was from Las Vegas, that her husband was rich, and that he
had been murdered.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of a man named Yehuda, dishonorably discharged from
the Israeli army, and a plot she said he had hatched with her
husband's trustees _ a plot that involved killing her to get her
share of the estate.
</P>
<P>
   It was an incredible story, Lundergan said, but in Mexico, he
had grown accustomed to hearing incredible things. And ``by that
time, I knew her and I trusted her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And kept up with her, even when he returned to Massachusetts for
knee surgery. When he was recovering, he said, she made ``a
friendly call'' to him; he didn't know from where. He invited her
to stay with him, to help him cook and clean.
</P>
<P>
   She arrived in December 1998, this time calling herself Leigh
Brown, Lundergan said. He figured she had taken the new name to
conceal herself from Yehuda, he said. He chalked up her rotating
set of wigs to the same motive: survival.
</P>
<P>
   He said she didn't want to go to the police because she didn't
trust them. And though he said they grew attached, he wouldn't say
whether their relationship turned romantic.
</P>
<P>
   In his low-ceilinged kitchen, lit by a bare lightbulb, Rudin
cooked his food. She also baked for next-door neighbor Donnamarie
Mason, 34, who said she took an instant liking to the ``wicked
nice'' woman who called herself Leigh Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, she thought it was strange that she kept changing her hair
color, and wore dark, tinted glasses, and wouldn't answer the door
if you knocked, Mason said. But she never imagined her friend was a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did folks at the U.S. Post Office down the street, where
Rudin picked up mail from a post office box registered to Leigh
Brown. Window clerk Rudy Colucci said his coworkers used to joke
that she was allergic to the sun, because her hair always covered
her face, and she always wore a handkerchief around her head.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Rudin, who was known in Las Vegas as the ``Black
Widow,'' grew skilled at disguising herself in her protracted run
from justice. Through detective work and tips _ often received from
``America's Most Wanted,'' which aired her story three times _ they
learned that she took on several aliases; she also went by Annette
Boatright, Margaret Mason, Margaret Frost, and Margaret Krafbe. She
sometimes wore brown contact lenses to mask her blue eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Rudin was nearly caught in August 1998, Petersen said, in
Phoenix, where she lived at a YMCA and worked in a hotel gift shop.
Police, responding to a tip following another ``America's Most
Wanted'' airing, picked her up for questioning, he said. But, with
a new fake ID, and an alias police did not know, she was released.
</P>
<P>
   The latest ``America's Most Wanted'' episode aired on Oct. 23,
as part of a ``Bad Girls Special.'' On Friday, Oct. 29, Las Vegas
police contacted the Massachusetts State Police with new leads,
pointing to the Boston area, Lt. Kevin Horton said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, police spoke to Colucci, who identified Rudin in a
picture. That afternoon and night, Colucci said, police gathered in
the post office to stake out Rudin's apartment house. They got
their breakthrough when the Domino's Pizza delivery man drove up.
</P>
<P>
   After he left the building, police followed him back to the
pizza shop and showed him a picture of Rudin, state police Sgt.
Mark Lynch said. He said he was ``90 percent sure'' he had seen
Rudin inside.
</P>
<P>
   Police wanted to enter the apartment peacefully, Lynch said,
because they feared Lundergan might have a gun. So they borrowed a
Domino's uniform and pizza box and knocked on the door. Lundergan
opened it.
</P>
<P>
   When police rushed in, and knocked him down, ``my first thought
was Yehuda. My heart was going a mile a minute.'' Lundergan said.
</P>
<P>
   State police have interviewed Lundergan, but have not charged
him with anything, Lynch said. Rudin spent the weekend at a State
Police lock-up where, Lynch said, ``she has made many attempts to
be charming.'' She was transferred Monday to Framingham, near state
police headquarters and a women's prison.
</P>
<P>
   At her arraignment, Judge Robert Greco gave her a
court-appointed lawyer and set a pre-trial hearing for Nov. 24.
</P>
<P>
   Lundergan said that he still believes her story, and considers
her incapable of murder. Police in Las Vegas say they believe that
she did not act alone. They also say her husband had changed his
will before his death, leaving her only $500,000.

BRADLEY SEEKING HELP FROM MADISON AVENUE IN POLISHING IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From the time Bill Bradley began planning his
insurgent presidential campaign, he has met quietly for more than
16 months with Madison Avenue advertising executives who are
polishing his sometimes ponderous image by creating television
commercials and slogans.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising team calls itself the Crystal Group _ named
after Bradley's hometown of Crystal City, Mo. _ and its members
said they were preparing a multimillion-dollar television, print,
radio and Web advertising campaign to begin next month. They have
already come up with a possible tagline for Bradley's commercials
that is intended to persuade the public that he can topple Vice
President Al Gore for the Democratic nomination: ``It can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   That Bradley has met for so long with advertising executives
demonstrates the seriousness of his presidential campaign. It is
another example of how the campaign, far from a fly-by-night
operation, has long been painstakingly preparing to take on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   In a touch that seems more corporate than political, the
advertising executives said they were considering an offer from
Spike Lee to appear in the advertising campaign _ but that no
decision had been made. They said there had also been discussions
about featuring Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's outreach to advertising executives with more
experience marketing high-end products like Lotus automobiles and
huge corporations like AT&AMP;T and Colgate-Palmolive, underscores the
degree to which his campaign is seeking help from professionals who
know little about politics but do know how to run slick advertising
campaigns _ a strategy perfected by Ronald Reagan. By contrast,
Gore has turned to an advertising team with deep political
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Mark DiMassimo, the head of a New York advertising agency which
held the initial meeting with Bradley in July of 1998, said the
former senator was an appealing client because he was ``ready to
hear the good news along with the bad'' and immersed himself in
discussions about advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news was he has a reputation for brains and
independence and courage and he's got incredible credentials on the
race issue,'' DiMassimo said in an interview. But, he said, the bad
news was that the advertising team had to quiz Bradley repeatedly
to prod him to open up about why he wanted to be president. Then,
DiMassimo said, ``there was the boring,'' and the fact that Bradley
had two kinds of ideas: ``Smart ideas that will move people and
smart ideas that will make people's eyes glaze over.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMassimo said he and his colleagues had asked Bradley about
many of the questions his critics have raised: ``What do you stand
for? Are you ready to take off the gloves and get into a real
presidential contest? Are you going to be a real executive? Are you
going to make the fast decisions and throw the jabs that you need
to throw to get into this? Are you going to open up a little bit
emotionally? Why is your heart in this? Do you want to be president
so badly to put up with this significant gauntlet that you have to
go through?''
</P>
<P>
   At first, DiMassimo said, Bradley ``wasn't opening up.'' But
after long discussions, which he said people thought were ``like an
encounter group or A.A. meeting,'' he and others were satisfied
Bradley had responses that would play well with the public.
</P>
<P>
   Many details of Bradley's advertising campaign were reported in
the current issue of Adweek magazine. The Bradley campaign has kept
its advertising team so closely held that several of the executives
said they decided as a group not to speak to the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better if it comes out of one person's mouth,'' said
Marvin Waldman of the advertising agency, Young &AMP; Rubicam. ``We're
all in agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Declining to confirm details of the advertising plan, the
Bradley campaign's spokesman, Eric Hauser, said, ``We're not
interested in announcing to the world our strategy before we go out
and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if it was improper for a campaign that prides itself on
eschewing handlers and slick packaging to turn to Madison Avenue,
Hauser said: ``That's ridiculous. There's talent in a lot of
places. There are ideas that come from everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign appears to have tested its advertising with
New Hampshire voters. Mary Anne Mueller, a homemaker from
Londonderry, N.H., said she was paid to attend a focus group near
her home last week during which she and several other Democratic
women were asked for feedback on several Bradley commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mueller said she was not told who sponsored the gathering,
but that it appeared to be the Bradley campaign. She said she was
shown commercials that were biographical as well as ones that
featured the former senator at town meetings answering questions
about health care and other issues. She said all the advertisements
closed with the ``It can happen'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town meeting ads were good,'' said Mrs. Mueller, who is
leaning toward supporting Gore. ``The bio ones were a little too
schmaltzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Details of the advertising drive were confirmed by DiMassimo as
well as by participants who spoke on the condition that they not be
identified. DiMassimo said the team of consultants has changed over
several months but includes fewer than a dozen principals. He said
they have no immediate plan to develop advertisements that attack
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And he explained that Bradley has taken part in many of the
meetings to discuss advertisements and often resists pleas to be
more succinct.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very smart guy, but intelligent answers are not the
stuff that great drama is made of,'' DiMassimo said. ``He was very
open. He's looking for help in focusing himself. But he's going to
be himself. He isn't necessarily going for the high drama
performance.''

IN ENTERTAINMENT FOR THE WEB, CAUTION REIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Regis and Kathie Lee, watch out. The hosts of a
new talk show are none other than the Lord and Satan themselves. In
``The God &AMP; Devil Show,'' they interview guests like John Wayne _
one needn't be alive to be a guest on this show _ and viewers then
vote whether to send the guest to heaven or hell.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which features cartoon characters with realistic
voices, is coming soon to a screen near you _ a computer screen. It
is scheduled to appear on Entertaindom.com, a Web site that the
Warner Bros. studio is expected to start this month as the
entertainment industry begins a bold attempt to turn the Internet
into its next big medium.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Hollywood has used the Internet mainly to promote
films and television programs, rather than to transmit them.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of players, from big studios to small
entrepreneurs, are starting to provide entertainment on the Web,
either by delivering existing movies and television shows or by
creating programs specifically for online viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts could allow for development of new types of
interactive entertainment not possible on television and in movie
theaters and could give voice to artists not seen or heard through
those traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as different from television as television is from
radio,'' said Jim Banister, executive vice president of Warner
Bros. Online.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, formidable technical and business
challenges. With standard modems, it can take hours to download a
feature-length film onto a personal computer, and video usually
appears in a small box on the screen with blurry images that often
suddenly freeze.
</P>
<P>
   These problems will diminish as more people gain high-speed
access to the Internet, though it is not clear even then whether
people will want to watch shows at their desks rather than from the
sofa.
</P>
<P>
   And as happened when home video recording appeared on the scene,
much of Hollywood is wary of the new technology, considering it as
much a threat as an opportunity. Jack Valenti, the industry's chief
lobbyist, said in congressional testimony recently that piracy of
movies over the Internet could ``dwarf'' the existing problem.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern is that program creators can communicate
directly with audiences, bypassing the studios. Hollywood got a
taste of that when ``The Blair Witch Project,'' a low-budget movie
by unknown filmmakers, became a huge hit after an Internet
publicity campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're basically your own TV station,'' said Joseph Shields,
38, of Grand Rapids, Mich., who failed as a comic-strip creator but
gained a cult following on the Web with his offbeat interactive
cartoons, like the one in which a foul-mouthed frog in a blender
taunts the viewer into grinding him up.
</P>
<P>
   Shields' cartoons, or word of them, have spread like wildfire
through e-mail, and his Web site, www.joecartoon.com, gets as many
as 500,000 hits a day.
</P>
<P>
   Bit players like Shields have led the way; a dozen or more Web
sites, for instance, already show movies by independent filmmakers
who have trouble getting their work into theaters. But now,
heavyweights are jumping in.
</P>
<P>
   America Online announced a $30 million investment last week in
the Web site of Blockbuster Inc., the video-rental unit of Viacom.
The investment is aimed in part at developing video for Internet
delivery.
</P>
<P>
   And Seagram Co., owner of Universal Studios, recently held a
meeting of 100 top executives to draw up plans for internet
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks SKG, the studio started by Steven Spielberg, said
last month that it would form a Web entertainment venture with
Imagine Entertainment, the production company started by Ron
Howard. The new company, Pop.com, is being financed initially by
$50 million from Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and Dell Computer have invested in Digital
Entertainment Network, a start-up in Los Angeles that creates
original Web programs. WireBreak Entertainment, another such
start-up, counts Michael Jordan, the former chief executive of CBS,
among its backers. And Frank Biondi Jr., the former chief executive
of Universal Studios, has invested in such companies as Atomfilms
and SightSound.com, both of which offer movies on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros.' Entertaindom, the biggest effort by a major
studio, will offer the studio's own Looney Tunes cartoons as well
as shows licensed from others, like ``The God &AMP; Devil Show'' from
Mondo Media of San Francisco. It will also draw on the magazines
and record company of its parent, Time Warner, to provide
entertainment information and to sell concert tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Moloshok, the president of Warner Bros. Online, said studios
need to become more active on the Web or lose out to Internet
start-ups. ``Hollywood has been hibernating in its cave for
years,'' he said. ``The Real Networks, the Yahoos have been
sneaking into our cave and stealing our food.''
</P>
<P>
   Record companies were caught flat-footed by the speed at which
the Internet began to be used to distribute music, legally and
illegally. Studios are owned by the same companies as the record
labels and should be preparing. But are they?
</P>
<P>
   Except for Warner Bros. and 20th Century Fox, a unit of News
Corp., none of the Hollywood studios would talk about Internet
entertainment _ a sign, some industry executives say, that the
studios have not figured out what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the studios are taking the path of least resistance _ what
can we do that's not competitive with our existing business?'' said
David Wertheimer, chief executive of Wirebreak and former head of
the online activities of Paramount Pictures, which is owned by
Viacom. ``I think they'll be surprised at how big it becomes how
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say that caution is justified. There have been several
failures in online entertainment, including early efforts by
Microsoft and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a big sinkhole,'' said Jake Winebaum, who once
ran the Internet operations of Walt Disney. ``I think there's going
to be a lot of money spent before the consumer is ready for it.''
Disney offers some entertainment for children on the Internet but
has pursued a broader Web strategy with a general portal and search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   Studios also believe they can wait, because they have access to
the best talent. Few if any of the thousands of garage bands that
distribute their music over the Internet have become stars, posing
little competition for the major labels. And home-grown Web video
shows might become no more of a threat than the amateur programs on
public-access cable television.

 LOS ANGELES: cable television.

<P>
   ``As far as tapping a mass audience, it's going to be difficult
because it's pretty grungy stuff right now,'' said James Murdoch,
who is in charge of Internet operations for News Corp. and its Fox
studio. He and some other executives said that if good programs did
arise online, studios could buy them or their production companies
and even turn them into television programs.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's ABC uses the Web to provide statistics to go with
``Monday Night Football.'' Fox is looking at creating virtual
communities tied to shows like ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony Pictures is allowing users of Web TV, a device that brings
Web pages onto television sets, to play along with ``Jeopardy'' and
``Wheel of Fortune,'' two game shows it produces. It also offers
video games online. But executives at Sony, one of the few major
studios not affiliated with a television network, have indicated
that they are interested in the Internet for program distribution
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In that it is used for chatting, games and idle surfing, the Web
is already a big entertainment venue, though not for traditional
video and movies. Some analysts say the Web is best suited for such
interactive activities, rather than for transmitting shows that are
best seen on television or in a theater.
</P>
<P>
   Many Web entertainment sites try to provide some sense of
community by letting viewers comment on the show, chat with other
viewers or even influence the plot, however minimally.
</P>
<P>
   But it remains to be seen whether such active viewing can be as
engrossing as traditional entertainment, in which viewers suspend
their disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there has been no big hit show on the Internet that
defines the medium, in the way that Milton Berle's show did in
television's infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the made-for-the-Web shows now online are in short
``Webisodes,'' only a few minutes long, and many are cartoons.
Shorter programs are more tolerable with existing technology, and
animation can be transmitted with higher quality than video.
</P>
<P>
   But the brevity also reflects the way Web programs are being
viewed _ as a quick break for people working on their computers.
People describe Web entertainment as a ``lean-forward experience''
rather than the ``lean-back experience'' of watching television or
a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to watch a half-hour of `Seinfeld' or an
hour-and-a-half movie on the PC in the office,'' said Johan
Liedgren, chief executive of Honkworm International, a Seattle
company whose Internet shows feature animated fish talking in a
bar.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the shows are sophomoric, if not downright demented, in
part because the Web has been a refuge for shows unsuitable for a
general television audience and because such fare is intended to
appeal to teen-age boys and young men. In addition to Shields' frog
cartoon, for example, there is ``The Peeper,'' a cartoon about a
peeping Tom, created by the comedian and actor Adam Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   One big question is whether any Web entertainment can make
money. Some sites are offering or planning to offer pay-per-view
movies or charge subscription fees. Program developers hope they
can syndicate their shows to other Web sites, such as portals and
e-commerce sites that might provide entertainment to lure
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Most shows, including ``God &AMP; Devil,'' are being offered free
and their providers depend on advertising, but it is not clear
whether online shows can draw big enough audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Honkworm gets 500,000 viewers each month for all its shows
combined, while a television program can draw millions in a night.
The average film shown on Ifilm.com, a Web site offering free
independent films, draws 5,000 viewers, though some films can get
up to 50,000. SightSound.com, which charges a few dollars to Web
users to download movies, says its most popular title is ``rented''
60 times a month, less than a single video store can do.
</P>
<P>
   Though most Web programming is now made ``for people who live in
SoHo or Silicon Valley,'' the audience will broaden, said Moloshok
of Entertaindom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainstreamers are coming online,'' he said. ``I don't want to
create the niche show. I want to create the `Seinfeld.'''

MICROSOFT TACTICS LEFT LOTUS, IBM OUT IN THE COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It began as a hostile takeover. But when IBM Corp. struck a deal
to acquire Lotus Development Corp. in 1995, many in the computer
industry saw a potentially rich and profitable marriage ahead. IBM
had the deep pockets to continue expanding Lotus' flagship Notes
software for helping business groups work together efficiently. And
the deal might even mean a revival of the Cambridge, Mass.
company's moribund office-software business, with IBM driving
additional sales of Lotus SmartSuite.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no joy 3,000 miles away, at the Redmond, Wash.
headquarters of Microsoft Corp. Microsoft had its eye on the
groupware market too; knocking off Lotus Notes would now be much
tougher with the power of IBM behind the product.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there was a new threat from Lotus' SmartSuite. The
high-quality set of office software programs had never posed much
of a problem for Microsoft's dominant Office suite. But IBM could
change that. IBM produced millions of desktop computers each year,
and it could easily grow the market for SmartSuite by including a
copy of the program on many of those machines.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in the view of US District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, Microsoft decided to strike. In last week's findings of
fact in the Microsoft antitrust case, Jackson found that
``Microsoft consistently pressured IBM to reduce its support for
software products that competed with Microsoft's offerings, and it
used its monopoly power in the market for . . . operating systems
to punish IBM for its refusal to cooperate.''
</P>
<P>
   When IBM insisted on distributing SmartSuite, Jackson found,
Microsoft withheld its new Windows 95 software from IBM until 15
minutes before the product's official release. Other, more
compliant manufacturers had gotten the software weeks earlier, so
they could begin building computers around it. The delay cost IBM
millions in lost sales. And for years thereafter, Microsoft charged
IBM a higher price for its Windows software than the amount paid by
other manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   IBM, Lotus and Microsoft executives all declined to comment on
the findings, but the episode illustrates the range of tactics
that, in Judge Jackson's view, Microsoft was willing to use to
perpetuate its monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   IBM wasn't the only company to feel Microsoft's wrath. The
antitrust case grew out of claims that Microsoft gave away its
Internet Explorer browser, and later incorporated it into the
Windows operating system, in order to crush a competing product
made by Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   As the US Justice Department investigated further, it uncovered
more stories of sharp practices, and incorporated them into their
case. Justice Department lawyers say that Microsoft threatened to
stop making Microsoft Office for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh
unless Apple made the Internet Explorer its preferred browser. They
say the company persuaded Intel Corp., the world's largest maker of
computer chips, to abandon a new chip design that might have
undercut Windows. And they say that Microsoft threatened to
withhold access to Windows 95 from Compaq Computer Corp., one of
the world's largest PC makers, unless Compaq configured the desktop
of their computers in accord with Microsoft's specifications.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson sided almost entirely with the Justice Department.
``Through its conduct toward Netscape, IBM, Compaq, Intel, and
others,'' he wrote, ``Microsoft has demonstrated that it will use
its prodigious market power and immense profits to harm any firm
that insists on pursuing initiatives that could intensify
competition against one of Microsoft's core products.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus chief technology officer John Landry says that Microsoft's
unfair dealings began long before the IBM acquisition. By that
time, Lotus had already lost its long-standing dominance in the
market for spreadsheet software, and has been playing catch-up in
the office suite market ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, says Landry, was a Microsoft tactic he calls ``a
head fake,'' similar to the way a football quarterback glances in
one direction, only to throw in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, now an IBM Corp. vice president and chairman of the
internet startup AnyDay.com, said the head fake persuaded Lotus to
focus on making a new version of 1-2-3 for OS/2, an operating
system jointly developed by Microsoft and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   According to Landry, Microsoft's intent was to distract its
competitors while it focused on Windows, an operating system that
belonged to Microsoft alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had a situation where Gates had publicly announced to that
world that he and IBM were going to build a new operating system
called OS/2,'' said Landry. ``That was one of the most duplicitous
statements that ever emanated from a company known for them.
Because of it, they had all their competition writing software for
the operating system they knew wasn't going to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus devoted most of its development effort to the creation of
a version of 1-2-3 that would run on OS/2. But by May 1990 Windows
3.0 was ready, and became a major success. By year's end, Microsoft
announced an end to its OS/2 partnership with IBM. OS/2 became
IBM's sole property, but despite a huge marketing campaign, the
product was a flop.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1991, Microsoft began offering the Excel spreadsheet
for Windows 3.0. The product was an immediate success, taking vast
amounts of business from 1-2-3. Only in late 1991 did Lotus finally
bring out a Windows version of 1-2-3. But by then the damage was
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a brilliant strategic move,'' Landry admits,
``and it took real kahunas to do it.'' But at the heart of
Microsoft's success, he believes, was a deliberate strategy to
deceive other software makers into focusing on the OS/2 market,
instead of writing programs for Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Landry's head fake story doesn't figure in Jackson's scathing
decision, and a former colleague of Landry's says that Microsoft
did nothing wrong in this case.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Ingari, president of Wheelhouse, an Internet marketing
firm in Burlington, Mass., ran Lotus' spreadsheet business from
1987 to 1990, when he was put in charge of worldwide marketing. ``I
have never put much stock in the head fake,'' said Ingari. ``You
had to be asleep in 1988 not to know that Microsoft was focused on
Windows 3.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, stories like Landry's about real or alleged
double-dealing by Microsoft are legion in the computer industry.
Many of the examples cited in Jackson's decision have been
circulating for years. IBM's troubles with Microsoft following the
Lotus acquisition are among the most significant examples cited by
Jackson because they suggest Microsoft was powerful enough to
intimidate the world's largest computer maker.
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson said in his decision, IBM could resolve its problems
with Microsoft only ``by de-emphasizing those products of its own
that competed with Microsoft and instead promoting Microsoft's
products.''
</P>
<P>
   Lotus, meanwhile, under its current CEO Jeff Papows, has been
careful to avoid direct confrontations with Microsoft. But last
year, Papows testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
saying that Microsoft's inclusion of its Outlook Express electronic
mail program with the Windows 98 operating system gives Microsoft
an unfair advantage over Lotus' flagship messaging program Notes.
Papows also said that Microsoft was trying to stifle Lotus
SmartSuite by threatening to raise the price of Windows to computer
firms that included SmartSuite on their machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pattern is absolutely clear,'' Papows told the comittiee.
``If we don't deal with it now, we're going to be dealing with a
single software company.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ ``Welcome, Gus,'' read a big white banner
the other day, using a nickname for Indonesia's new president. ``We
are the students and we will be your opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorists slowed down to avoid the small, lively crowd and
sighed in weariness. More student demonstrations. Hadn't they
already got what they wanted?
</P>
<P>
   Yes and no. As the country has learned over the last two years,
there is no compromising with the students' moral agenda. And there
is no denying their influence. Indonesia would not be where it is
today without the students: free of a dictator, under a government
duly elected by a national assembly and moving forward with
democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   It was their relentless rallies that kept alive the struggle
early last year against President Suharto, when he had almost
managed to quash his opposition.
</P>
<P>
   It was their exhausting enthusiasm in the months following
Suharto's resignation in May 1998 _ their often daily protests,
their hair-trigger moral indignation, their deaths at the hands of
the military _ that assured that democratic reforms would not
founder in inertia.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after the election on Oct. 20 of President Abdurrahman
Wahid _ also known as Gus Dur _ the student movement is redefining
itself as his political opposition. They will do what they do best:
keep the heat on.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new president is not a new era,'' said Bachtiar Firdaus, 23,
an engineering student. ``Transition to democracy is a long
journey, so we must watch what the government does. So we declare
that the student movement has changed from a reform movement to an
opposition movement, from an agent of change to a director of
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel S. Lev, a professor of political science at the
University of Washington, said: ``Those students out there have
made a big difference. If you want to talk about democracy, it's
right there on the streets. Those students from the beginning have
been the ones who kept their minds most on national interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Their basic agenda stays the same: the withdrawal of the
military from politics, the supremacy of law, clean government and
an investigation of corruption by Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   Students have been a moral force with potential political
influence throughout Indonesia's history and they have their own
lore and their own notable generations, somewhat like the
graduating classes of military academies.
</P>
<P>
   Firdaus said they were acting now on the basis of lessons
learned in the late 1960s when a student movement that had helped
Suharto come to power allowed itself to be co-opted and
neutralized, only to see him become more and more repressive.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps abashed by their own passivity, members of Indonesia's
middle class have allowed their children to lead them. When the
protests became dangerous, professional groups sometimes supported
them with food and funds. Some professors, publicly cautious, urged
their students to cut class and save the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But few people joined them on the front lines. Indonesia's
protests have been notable for the absence of labor unions,
professionals, clergy and political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati Sukarnoputri, the figurehead of opposition to Suharto
and his successor, B.J. Habibie, shunned the protests. More than
once, she refused requests to step in when demonstrators were being
killed in her name.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of her inauguration as vice president on Oct. 21,
though, she thanked them. Their noisy protests during the electoral
assembly, and the threat of widespread unrest if she lost, had been
one of her strongest campaign planks.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the tide has turned and the students' democratic agenda
dominates, even the military feels compelled to offer them a bow.
</P>
<P>
   The country's most prominent military figure, Gen. Wiranto, the
former armed forces chief of staff, has called them heroes and
offered condolences for those who had died in clashes with his men.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Welcome, Gus'' demonstration was tiny by the standards
Jakarta has come to know, perhaps 50 people in all. The
demonstrators raised their fists as they read a list of demands:
Public figures must disclose their wealth, unqualified ministers
must be fired; military officers must withdraw from government
positions; the political, economic, social, cultural and
educational systems must be improved.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with eight police officers following lazily in a small
van, the students marched down a familiar protest route near the
house where Suharto lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them have spent far more time over the last two years in
political teach-ins than at their studies, and they explain their
role with the confidence of youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the political parties want to be part of the government
and no one wants to be in the opposition,'' said one of the small
group's leaders, Goenawan, 22, an electrical engineering student.
``That is not a good way to be a democratic country. We want to
make a democratic system that will be balanced. The students can do
that. We are a moral and intellectual movement. We have no policy.
We have no ambition to be in government.''
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Firman, a law student who is a leader of a militant
group called City Forum, said its platform is governed by ``what
most of the people want.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is pure democracy, am I right?'' he said. ``We don't have
our own interests. We don't bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   But as they have shown, they do have bargaining power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the government starts to forget what the people want, we
will start the demonstrations, we will go down the street again,''
Firman warned. ``We don't care who is in the government; we don't
care. If you want to do your job and be credible in people's eyes,
just listen to us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton celebrated the tenth anniversary
of the fall of the Berlin Wall on Monday with a speech outlining
the major challenges he believes Europe faces and a warning that
any hope of bringing stability to the Balkans will require pushing
President Slobodan Milosovic of Yugoslavia from power.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at Georgetown University, his alma mater, Clinton took
the unusual step of praising his two Republican predecessors,
Ronald Reagan and George Bush, and how they handled the last days
of communism in Europe. And with his latest call for America to
resist isolationism, he described in sketchy form his foreign
policy agenda for the remaining 13 months of his administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worth devoting some small fraction of this
nation's great wealth and power to help build a Europe where wars
don't happen,'' he said, ``where our allies can do their share and
we help them do so, to seize this historic opportunity for peace
between Arabs and Israelis in the Middle East, to make sure that
nuclear weapons from the former Soviet Union don't fall into the
wrong hands.''
</P>
<P>
   And he ticked off other goals, from debt relief for the poorest
nations to paying off American obligations to the United Nations _
all components of the final budget negotiations Clinton and
Congress haggled over through the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   But his tone was far more muted than after Republicans led the
drive last month to defeat the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and
both Clinton and his national security adviser, Sandy Berger, have
backed away from their earlier assertions about a rising tide of
Republican isolationism.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he never referred to Republicans at all, only alluding
to isolationist tendencies that ``are disproportionately
represented in the deciding body.'' Nor did he mention Democrats,
who have scuttled several of his global trade initiatives and who
may be a much greater threat to his effort to integrate China into
the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton described the first challenge in Europe today as
``building the right kind of partnership with Russia, a Russia that
is stable, democratic and cooperatively engaged with the West.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Milosevic ``the last living relic of the age of
European dictators,'' and said ``there can be no future for him.''
And Clinton said he was prepared to turn to ending the hatreds
between Greece and Turkey, both of which he is scheduled to visit
starting this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   His praise for Reagan was particularly effusive. The former
president ``said so plainly what many people on the other side of
the wall had trouble understanding, that the Soviet empire was evil
and the wall should be torn down.'' Bush was credited with
``managing skillfully the fall of the Soviet empire and the
unification of Germany in setting the stage for a Europe whole and
free.''

POPE TRAVELS TO GEORGIA, BUT ORTHODOX PATRIARCH KEEPS A RELIGIOUS
DISTANCE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia _ Pope John Paul II met with the patriarch of
the Georgian Orthodox Church on Monday in an encounter that visibly
illustrated the lingering obstacles to the pope's longtime dream of
reconciling the Roman Catholic Church and Eastern Orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   The pope spoke of his fervent desire to promote reconciliation
between the two churches that have been divided since the schism of
1054. Patriarch Ilia II, the Georgian prelate, who addressed the
pope solely as a visiting head of state, avoided any mention of
religious rapprochement. When he spoke of deepening ``friendly
relations'' he said he hoped it would happen not between churches
but ``between our countries.''
</P>
<P>
   In an odd reversal of roles, it was President Eduard
Shevardnadze, a former Soviet foreign minister, who, at an airport
greeting ceremony, spoke in religious terms, invoking ``the Holy
Mother.'' Shevardnadze, who was baptized in the Orthodox Church in
1992, pressed for this papal visit, and persuaded the patriarch to
consent.
</P>
<P>
   In his welcome speech, the patriarch sounded like a senior
government official intent on painting the Catholic leader's visit
as a foreign policy coup. Saying the visit ``proves our country
aspires to a connection with Europe,'' the patriarch said he hoped
the pope's presence would ``help place Georgia on a high
international level.''
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders issued a joint statement condemning the rise of
violence and terrorism in the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old pope, visibly tired and shivering in the cold
winds of Georgia, flew from India to Tbilisi to make his second
visit to a predominantly Orthodox country. But it seems likely that
Georgia will not provide the kind of breakthrough the pope achieved
in Romania last May, when he was the first Roman Catholic pontiff
to visit an Orthodox country in more than 1,000 years. There, he
rode in his glass-enclosed vehicle through a church square with
Patriarch Teoctist at his side. The two leaders set an historic
precedent by holding joint prayer services at each other's
churches.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgian patriarch, who took the pope to an 11th century
Orthodox cathedral, thanked him for his role in ``the process that
led to the collapse of the system that rejected God in former
socialist lands.'' He did not pray with him. The Georgian Church
has instructed its followers not to attend the pope's Mass at a
sports stadium on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``From Romania we learned that the joint services provoked a lot
of tension, including among the bishops,'' said Father David
Sharashenidze, the spokesman for the patriarchate, shortly before
the pope and patriarch were due to deliver speeches there. ``The
canon law of the Orthodox Church does not permit us to celebrate
Mass together.''
</P>
<P>
   A priest in St. Nino's Church told a local newspaper that it
would be a ``sin'' for Orthodox believers to attend a papal Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, the pope first began talking about reconciling
the Eastern and Western churches before the end of the millennium.
As recently as last January, on his way to Mexico, he told
reporters he wanted to go to Moscow, but the Russian Orthodox
Church has rejected any ecumenical discussions with the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the pope arrived in Georgia, the Russian Orthodox
patriarch, Aleksy II, once again said he would not involve the
pope, or meet him if he came at the government's invitation. He
said the Georgian Church was free to do as it pleased, but then
warned, ``They must realize the consequence of their steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The enmity between Rome and the Georgian Orthodox Church is not
as deep as that with Moscow. Besides the core theological disputes
over such principles as the primacy and infallibility of the pope,
the Russian Orthodox Church is battling with the Catholic Church
over property, especially in Ukraine. The Russian Orthodox leaders
suspect the Vatican of seeking to convert Orthodox believers using
Eastern-rite Catholic Churches that are loyal to Rome. But even in
Georgia, where Catholics make up less than two percent of the
population, Catholic missionaries and aid workers are viewed with
suspicion as proselytizers.
</P>
<P>
   Many Georgian bishops mistrust interfaith dialogue. Patriarch
Ilia, who had served as one of the presidents of the World Council
of Churches from 1979 to 1983, was forced to abandon ecumenical
activities. In 1997 the Holy Synod voted to withdraw from the World
Council and the European Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch voiced some of his church's concerns to the pope
Monday. The two men sat side by side underneath candle-lit icon
frescoes inside the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral, where hundreds of
Catholics and some Orthodox believers had gathered to witness the
historic occasion, many of them mobbing the altar area and nearly
crushing a few cardinals for a closer view.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Ilia listed many of the economic and social problems
afflicting Georgia, and included ``various kinds of sects and
religious movements from foreign countries.'' He accused them of
``setting up `so-called humanitarian aid' and `charitable'
organizations to try to proselytize and persuade the religiously
uneducated needy population to become their members.''
</P>
<P>
   The patriarch was apparently referring to Protestant evangelical
ministries and other missionary movements, which are the bane of
Orthodox Churches throughout the former Soviet Union, but it was
nonetheless a less than tactful remark. In Tbilisi, the pope is
staying at a newly completed Catholic shelter for the homeless,
which he will dedicate to Mother Theresa of Calcutta on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul II, who fell ill in Poland last summer and was forced
to cancel a visit to the deathbed of Catholicos Karekin I, the
Armenian patriarch, seemed determined Monday to keep the momentum
of Romania going in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assure you that my representative in Georgia will make every
effort to foster this relationship of cooperation and
understanding,'' he told the patriarch. ``He knows how much this
means to the bishop of Rome. No matter how difficult the path of
reconciliation, we must implore the Holy Spirit to bring to
completion what we, in obedience to the Lord, seek to make
possible.''

REPORT BY HOUSE REPUBLICANS SAYS CLEMENCY FOR PUERTO RICANS WAS
CAMPAIGN MOVE
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Ind., Ill., Conn.)  (nk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A report by House Republicans asserts that
President Clinton's grant of clemency to a group of Puerto Rican
nationalists followed discussions in the White House that such a
move would provide political help to some Democratic members of
Congress and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Republicans on the House government Reform
Committee included documents subpoenaed from the White House and
Justice Department in connection with the president's Aug. 11 grant
of clemency to 16 of the prisoners. The prisoners were convicted
more than two decades ago of crimes on behalf of the FALN, a Puerto
Rican nationalist group.
</P>
<P>
   The report's assertion of a political dimension to the
deliberations is partly drawn from a memorandum from Jeffrey L.
Farrow, co-chairman of the president's interagency group on Puerto
Rico. In the memo, Farrow urges that the president or vice
president meet with three Puerto Rican members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The memo, sent on March 6 by e-mail to several colleagues in the
White House, said: ``The VP's Puerto Rican position would be
helped.'' It said the clemency issue was a top priority for Rep.
Luis V. Gutierrez and ``of high constituent importance'' to Reps.
Jose E. Serrano and Nydia M. Velazquez. Gutierrez is from Illinois
and Serrano and Ms. Velazquez are from New York. All three are
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Maria Echaveste, the deputy chief of staff at the
White House, sent an e-mail message, attaching and approving of
Farrow's ideas, to Charles F.C. Ruff, then the White House counsel,
who oversaw clemency issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck _ Jeff's right about this _ very hot issue,'' Ms.
Echaveste's e-mail message said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kennedy, a spokesman for the White House, said Monday night
that ``neither the vice president nor his staff were involved in
the decision-making process on this issue.'' Kennedy also said:
``The president's decision was made on the merits. And as his
former counsel, Mr. Ruff, has publicly stated, politics was not
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The three members of Congress did meet with Ruff and senior
officials in the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican report was prepared by the staff of Rep. Dan
Burton of Indiana, the committee chairman and a vigorous critic of
the Clinton administration. The report was circulated to all
members of the committee on Monday and was made available by
congressional officials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's clemency offer was widely opposed by law-enforcement
officials, including the U.S. attorneys in Illinois and
Connecticut, where many of the trials took place, and FBI Director
Louis J. Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   The events leading to Clinton's clemency offer have remained
murky because the White House and the Justice Department have
declined to release much information. The Constitution explicitly
gives the president the sole authority to issue pardons, so
administration lawyers have argued that Clinton's discussions with
subordinates over clemency for the Puerto Ricans are privileged and
need not be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The documents in the House Republicans' report, along with
documents disclosed last month by the Senate Judiciary Committee,
provide a partial picture of how the issue was debated in the White
House and the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   The documents appear to show that the deliberations over
clemency were a blend of political and humanitarian concerns. Most
of the documents focus on the arguments that the prisoners had
served long enough and that it was time to show mercy.
</P>
<P>
   The documents show that Mayra Martinez-Fernandez, an assistant
to Farrow, had tried to build support for clemency by seeking
letters of approval from prominent people like former President
Jimmy Carter. Carter did, in fact, write supporting clemency.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Martinez-Fernandez's other ideas suggest she did not
play a major role on the issue. She wrote that the White House
should seek support for clemency from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New
York. Giuliani has become one of the most vocal critics of the
clemency offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Farrow and Echaveste messages show that there were political
considerations at least among some staff members. There is,
however, no mention of Hillary Rodham Clinton, who has denied that
the clemency offer was designed to help her likely Senate candidacy
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 people who were offered clemency, two refused it and
two others, who were already out of prison, did not respond. Twelve
accepted the offer and were freed, and some have returned to Puerto
Rico.

PRI EMERGES FROM DEMOCRATIC ELECTION WITH A POLISHED IMAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
and MICHAEL RILEY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ In the end, a democratic election proved a
cakewalk for the bosses of Mexico's long-ruling party, which had
gained a reputation through the decades as arrogant and corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida, seen as the candidate of the leaders of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, won a landslide victory
in Sunday's four-way primary for the party's presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida's main opponent, who many feared would contest the
results and split the party, accepted defeat Monday and said he
will stay with the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling party's leadership, disparaged by many as vote-fixing
relics, emerged with a freely elected candidate and a polished
image of electoral righteousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody thought it was going to come out this
well,'' said Francisco Abundis, a pollster for the PRI. ``There's a
clear victor, a big turnout and a humble loser. Does the world get
any better than this?''
</P>
<P>
   Since the party took power in 1929 to quell infighting among the
victors of the Mexican Revolution, the PRI's presidential
candidates were handpicked by Mexico's outgoing president and were
then duly voted into office in stage-managed national elections.
President Ernesto Zedillo announced in March that he was scrapping
that backroom system in favor of an open primary.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 10 million people voted Sunday, far more than PRI
officials had hoped. As many as a fifth of the votes were cast by
people who did not belong to the PRI. And Labastida's image as a
man of the system, and his message of economic and social
moderation, easily won the day.
</P>
<P>
   A former interior minister and career PRI bureaucrat, Labastida
won 272 of 300 electoral districts, according to official party
results. He out-polled his closest rival, former Tabasco state Gov.
Roberto Madrazo, by a 2-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electorate in general prefers a stable course in economic
and social policy,'' said Federico Estevez, a political scientist
with Mexico City's Autonomous Technological Institute of Mexico.
``The PRI politicians have changed, and the rules have changed.
It's the electorate that is conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want radical change,'' Estevez said. ``That's the
dynamics of this primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo, a longtime PRI politician who tried to run as an
outsider, gained in the polls last summer by attacking the
market-oriented economic policies carried out by PRI national
governments since 1985 and by painting Labastida as the party
elite's candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo's challenge rested on a bet that millions of PRI
rank-and-file members were so angry with their party leadership's
free-market reforms _ which have slashed incomes of the workers and
peasants who are the ruling party's bedrock _ that they would be
ready to revolt.
</P>
<P>
   Similar discontent led Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and other PRI leaders
to defect from the party in 1987, taking millions of voters with
them. Many Mexicans believe Cardenas was cheated of victory in the
1988 presidential elections officially won by Carlos Salinas de
Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   But Madrazo's wager on discontent was a bad one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not 1988,'' said Estevez, who as late as September
was predicting a Madrazo victory. ``There was no revolt waiting to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Madrazo and the two other primary candidates had complained in
the weeks before the election of unfair campaign practices in favor
of Labastida. Madrazo had made indirect threats that he would leave
the party if Sunday's vote appeared fraudulent.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida's lopsided win, and the perception that the
election was clean, if not exactly fair, has all but erased the
possibility of a split in the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are sweet defeats and bitter victories,'' Madrazo said
in a concession speech early Monday. ``I recognize the tendencies
weren't favorable for me, but you know the process was never
equitable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought against the machine and demonstrated it could be
done,'' he said. ``We're going to continue working within the party
in order to create change.''
</P>
<P>
   His victory gives Labastida a strong mandate within the PRI.
Analysts say that over the next week the PRI's opposing factions
will quickly mend fences to get behind their candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is considered the front-runner in what will
essentially be a three-man race in the July 2 presidential
elections. Although a handful of splinter parties will field
candidates, Labastida's main opponents are Vicente Fox of the
center-right National Action Party and Cardenas, who leads a
center-left coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Talks aimed at forming an alliance between Fox and Cardenas to
support a single presidential candidate collapsed in September,
guaranteeing the PRI a splintered opposition in next July's general
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The more democratic image provided the PRI by the primary had
driven up the party's standing in opinion polls by 10 percent even
before Sunday's vote. The outcome will further bolster the ruling
party's fortunes, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party is enjoying the equivalent of a convention bounce,''
said Carlos Elizondo, director of CIDE, a Mexico City think tank.
``It has emerged from the primary in a much stronger position than
when it began.''
</P>
<P>
   Its improved fortunes come at a crucial time for the PRI, which
has faced ever stiffer political opposition since 1983. The party
lost control of the lower house of Congress in 1997's elections.
Opposition parties now govern about a third of Mexico's 31 states
and most of its largest urban centers, including Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The big loser may well be Fox, a charismatic former Coca-Cola
executive who resigned the governorship of Guanajuato state to run
for the presidency. Labastida polled strongest Sunday in the
northern Mexico states that have traditionally supported Fox's
National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox has fared well in recent polls against Labastida,
some analysts say there's not enough difference between the two
men's economic and social policies to entice voters to throw the
PRI out of the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor Fox,'' Estevez said. ``The truth is there are no burning
issues. There is nothing he can grab on to. It will be very hard to
beat back (Labastida's) lead at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday's surest winner may have been Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1994 after the PRI's original presidential candidate
was assassinated, Zedillo oversaw the collapse of the peso in
December of that year, which sparked the worse economic crisis in
modern Mexican history. A Yale-trained economist and bureaucrat,
Zedillo gained points for economic management but was seen by many
analysts as politically inept.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot who doubted him after the 1997 election and
the loss of Congress. But now he's going to be much stronger.``
said Sergio Sarmiento, a newspaper columnist and political analyst.
``Zedillo now will be known as the president who democratized the
country.''

   WASHINGTON _ A federal court's finding last week that Microsoft
is a predatory monopoly that has stifled competition has left this
year's crop of presidential candidates speechless.
</P>
<P>
   In an already overheated campaign season with candidates
commenting on a wide range of issues, the lack of comment on the
landmark case has been striking.
</P>
<P>
   No top Republican or Democratic candidates or their spokesmen
have said anything substantive about the findings of fact released
Friday by Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, even though the document
has rocked the technology world. Nor have they laid out their views
on the kind of antitrust issues that the Microsoft case and its
yearlong trial have raised.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley told reporters Monday: ``My sense is,
based on what the judge said, we're probably moving toward some
kind of settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Vice President Al Gore said: ``The White House
has a long-standing policy of not commenting on ongoing Justice
Department litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gov. George W. Bush, R-Texas, said that as long
as the case was in litigation, Bush would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Steve Forbes, the Republican businessman, said:
``Technology, the free-enterprise system, is going to make this
lawsuit obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., could not be reached, although as
chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he has suggested that
the federal government was interfering with the free-enterprise
system and stifling innovation by taking Microsoft to court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a deafening silence,'' said Brett Bader, a Republican
political consultant based in Bellevue, Wash., near Microsoft's
home in Redmond.
</P>
<P>
   Bader, like other analysts, suggested that the candidates did
not want to choose between Microsoft and the rest of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if a presidential candidate wants to make points in the
Northwest, they need to show they are upset over this lawsuit, and
Al Gore should be prepared to defend himself against that next
year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts suggest that Microsoft will try to drag out the
case until the Clinton administration expires in January 2001 and a
new president appoints a new chief of the Justice Department's
antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the computer industry is playing an increasingly
important role in political campaigns. Microsoft gave $1.3 million
last year to candidates in both parties and has already donated
$600,000 so far this year. Its chairman, Bill Gates, has met
recently with Bush, Bradley and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Financial reports show that Bush has received nearly $29,000
from Microsoft employees since January. Bradley got $21,000, McCain
$18,000 and Gore $13,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Randlett, a consultant who advises Democrats on technology
issues, and a co-founder of TechNet, a lobbying firm for the
industry, said the candidates' silence was more likely a result of
lack of understanding of the complex issues facing the industry
than any attempt to play both sides of the aisle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said contributions from the non-Microsoft world outweighed
those from Microsoft by about 10-to-1, so there was little for a
candidate to fear from supporting the judge's findings.
</P>
<P>
   In other action Monday, the judge published a schedule for the
remaining proceedings that will carry the trial through the end of
January with a final verdict likely in February.
</P>
<P>
   By Dec. 6, he said, the Justice Department must file conclusions
of law, the legal arguments and precedents behind a ruling;
Microsoft must file by Jan. 17, and each side can file reply
motions through Jan. 31.

   GERMANY-WALL (Berlin) _ Virtally nobody predicted the fall of
the Berlin Wall _ and apparently nobody planned it. As a result,
two German states with divergent ideologies and cultures found
themselves propelled toward union on the panicky reaction of a
border guard who opened the gate at Berlin's Bornholmerstrasse
crossing without an explicit order to do so. Some of the effects of
that precipitation are still evident today. Most fundamentally, a
united Germany is not quite sure of its identity. By Roger Cohen.

   SCOTUS-DEATH-PENALTY (Washington) _ The question, as framed for
the Supreme Court by lawyers for death row inmates in Florida and
Nebraska, was whether a decades-long wait for a death sentence to
be carried out is itself so ``cruel and unusual'' as to be
unconstitutional. It was a question the court announced that it
would not answer. The justices turned down appeals by two convicted
murderers, and the action left in place a system under which the
length of time a person spends on death row is free of
constitutional scrutiny. By Linda Greenhouse. (The story has moved

industrial plants that are among the heaviest polluters in Texas.
For Bush, the program meant confronting the state's oil, gas and

 &HT;    For Streeter, many big returns
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A month ago, the odds of Clemson quarterback Brandon
Streeter playing another college football game were about as long
as the Tigers' prospects of earning a bowl invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Streeter, who broke his collarbone during a game against
North Carolina Oct. 2, returned to the lineup last week and helped
lead Clemson to a 58-7 win.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers finally had fully grasped the nuances of the
wide-open attack implemented by coach Tommy Bowden and offensive
coordinator Rich Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good system, `` Streeter said Monday. ``I wish I
had the opportunity to play in it longer. We move the ball so
quickly and we don't huddle, and we throw a lot of formations at
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Streeter passed for 279 yards and two touchdowns, and tailback
Travis Zachary rushed for a career-high 141 more as Clemson
compiled 558 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   Now, heading into Saturday's game at No. 14-ranked Georgia Tech
(6-2, 4-2) Streeter and the Tigers (5-4, 5-2) are thinking of not
only bagging the one win needed to qualify for postseason play, but
also claiming second place in the ACC standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't envision it 10 or 11 months ago when I took
the job,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could he have imagined Streeter, a graduate student from
Gettysburg, Pa., would be available as the Tigers, whose 2,267
passing yards are just 33 yards shy of school record, march toward
an improbable turn- around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rolling out to the right, and a North Carolina
linebacker hit me and another player fell on me,'' Streeter said of
the hit that nearly ended his college career. ``The weight of both
of them landed on top of me where my collarbone broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I thought about was that it's my senior season
and that would be my last time playing for Clemson. . . . (But)
when I learned it was a four-to-six week injury, I knew I had to
work and I prayed hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In returning, Streeter sent sophomore Woodrow Dantzler to the
bench. In his second start, against Maryland, Dantzler broke one of
the oldest records in Clemson annals with 435 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work really well together,'' said Streeter, who received a
standing ovation in his final home game Saturday when replaced by
Dantzler. ``We support each other so well. We both really want
what's best for the team.''

CLINTON WILL SPEND TWO DAYS IN SEATTLE AT WTO MEETING  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY and MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ President Clinton will come to Seattle for two days
during the upcoming World Trade Organization meeting, delivering a
major policy speech and meeting with citizens concerned about the
human face of global trade, congressional and Clinton
administration sources said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to arrive the evening of Nov. 30, the first
day of the conference and the day anti-WTO organizers are vowing to
put thousands of demonstrators into the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The president will face a dual challenge during his visit. The
WTO will use the Seattle meeting to launch a new round of trade
talks, and 11-hour negotiations are under way to bring China into
the 134-member organization.
</P>
<P>
   But the president also needs to bolster the position of his
favored successor, Vice President Al Gore. Gore used a recent
Seattle trade luncheon to argue that labor standards and
environmental protection ``are not second-class issues anymore''
and should be on the table at the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The president will be renewing a commitment to free trade
articulated during the 1992 campaign, in which Clinton used a
Seattle appearance to say he would fight to remove foreign barriers
to U.S. products but would not yield to trade protectionists in the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, the issue of trade remains divisive within
the Democratic Party. Two of the party's core constituencies, labor
and environmentalists, have been angrily critical of the Clinton
administration's handling of trade issues and are organizing
protests during the WTO meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Divisions within the Democratic Party have led to congressional
refusal to grant Clinton fast-track authority for expedited
negotiations of trade agreements with other countries, and Clinton
has called international trade ``the one remaining issue on which
we have not forged a consensus within our party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go to the American people and say, we have a whole
vision for the future that will be a unifying vision until we get
over this one last big hump,'' Clinton told the Democratic
Leadership Council last month. ``This is an exciting issue, and it
is a difficult issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore will be back in Seattle next Monday, and his schedule will
include meetings with labor and environmental leaders, but he will
not attend the WTO conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Words are cheap. We want real action to implement core labor
standards into trade agreements,'' Washington State Labor Council
president Rick Bender said after hearing Gore speak on his last
visit.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO has since endorsed Gore. But many of the vice
president's union and environmentalists supporters are waiting to
see if Clinton will deploy his clout on behalf of their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he should push hard for more openness in the World
Trade Organization. ... There is a lot of legitimate concern that
labor, the environment and human rights don't get the attention
they deserve,'' said former Gov. Mike Lowry, a free trade advocate
who is also close to labor and environmental activists.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Lanham, political director for the Boeing Machinists,
added: ``We're not anti-WTO. ... What we want is to elevate core
labor, environmental and human rights standards. Such core
standards include freedom to organize unions, a prohibition of
forced labor, and a minimum wage for work.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite criticism of U.S. trade policy from the streets of
Seattle to the halls of Congress, strong pro-free trade views have
been voiced by almost all of the Republican and Democratic
presidential candidates who have visited the state.
</P>
<P>
   In recent presidential elections, only two significant
candidates have questioned the wisdom of U.S. Trade policy _ Texas
billionaire Ross Perot and conservative commentator Pat Buchanan.
Perot had the most success with his first presidential bid in 1992,
when he successfully tapped into a vein of economic dissatisfaction
by railing against the North American Free Trade Agreement and
predicting a ``giant sucking sound'' of jobs heading south for
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who ran as a Republican in 1996, has switched to a bid
for the Reform Party nomination. He appeared earlier this year at
the Port of Seattle to dramatize the United States' $58 billion
trade deficit with China.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan argued that China was ``not remotely qualified'' to
join the WTO, and decried U.S. trade negotiators as ``too weak and
wimpish'' for not demanding complete access to Chinese markets as a
trade-ff for China's continuing to sell its products here.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Leadership Council, which is the ideologically
centrist wing of the party with which Clinton is closely
associated, has made trade policy its major concern, and is trying
to forge a new relationship between business and labor in support
of trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration contends that union officials are
blaming trade for jobs that are really lost because of technology,
and that the number of jobs created in this country by a booming
economy over the last several years far outweighs the number of
jobs lost for any reason.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the size of Seattle's anti-WTO protests, most experts
believe trade will not play a big role in how voters ultimately
cast their ballots. That is in part because economic issues are low
on voter priority lists in times like this when the economy is
strong, in part because trade issues are complicated, and in part
because all the major candidates espouse similar positions on trade
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major candidates out there _ Gore, Bradley, Bush and
McCain _ they're all essentially centrists, supporting a position
on trade that big business supports and that generally even labor
supports except when it impacts them quite narrowly,'' said Douglas
Schuler, a management professor at Rice University who studies
international trade policy and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Because the issue is complicated for Democrats, Gore in
particular has gone out of his way to voice his concern for labor
and environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters expect Gore to be their advocate. ``He doesn't just
have to be the loyal vice president,'' said Bill Arthur, director
of the Sierra Club's Northwest office.
</P>
<P>
   But James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and
Presidential Studies at American University in Washington, D.C.,
predicted that the WTO and trade will not be ``hot issues in this
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   `` Environmentalists and labor are trying to push the
candidates, and this president, to be more moderate, and to take
care with respect to the health and safety of workers and
environmental protections, but it's not a national movement that
catches people,'' Thurber said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the year that Perot had some success with the trade
issue, the national economy was thought to be in recession; this
year's strong economic growth makes trade a less important issue in
politics.

   March 27 was John Allen's last good day. He had been
semicomatose in the days leading up to his heart transplant
surgery, but now the transplant was working well and he was alert
and communicative. ``He was his old self,'' recalled his wife,
Sandy, a psychiatric nurse, who lives in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   There was, though, a troubling part of his recovery: the
inability of his doctors to wipe out a type of antibiotic-resistant
staph infection, usually spread on the hands of health care
workers. But Sandy Allen says that when she returned home that day,
she was hopeful her husband might soon be coming home himself. The
next day she got a call from one of his doctors. John Allen, 52,
the father of two teen-agers, was dead, killed by septic shock, an
overwhelming infection of the bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   There is no sure way of knowing exactly how Allen picked up this
hospital-based infection. But if years of studies of health care
workers are right, two things are certain. First, most of the
people who treated him during his hospitalization would swear they
had washed their hands before they touched him. And second, many of
them would be fooling themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hands are the most dangerous thing in the hospital,'' said Dr.
Robert A. Weinstein, director of infectious diseases for the Cook
County Bureau of Health Services in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That unclean hands can transmit germs is not news to anyone who
attended nursery school. More than 150 years ago a Hungarian
physician, Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis, discovered that ``childbed
fever,'' the infection that routinely killed women who had just
given birth, was being spread on his colleagues' bacteria-laden
hands. Yet a recent study _ conducted at the Duke University
Medical Center and published last month in The Lancet, a medical
journal _ found that only 17 percent of physicians treating
patients in an intensive care unit washed their hands
appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Research reported in The Annals of Internal Medicine this year
found that the lowest rates of compliance in a hospital were among
the busy staff members in a high-risk intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5
percent of the people admitted to hospitals, about 1.8 million
patients a year, will pick up an infection there. Twenty thousand
of them will die as a direct result of contracting an infection in
the hospital; by contrast, 17,171 Americans died of AIDS in 1998.
And hospital-acquired infections will contribute to the deaths of
70,000 people, far more than the 44,190 Americans who died of
breast cancer in 1997. The infections will cost $4.5 billion to
treat, the CDC estimates, and it says better infection control
could have prevented one-third of those cases.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is getting worse. Though hospital stays are shorter
and less frequent than they were 20 years ago, today's patients are
generally sicker and more vulnerable. As a result, in the last two
decades the rate of hospital-acquired infection has risen 36
percent. And the danger has intensified with the rise of new
strains of common microbes that are resistant to antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Take staphylococcus aureus, the infection contracted by John
Allen. It is carried by about 30 percent of adults with no ill
effect. But a strain that has emerged in hospitals is resistant to
methicillin, the most effective antibiotic used against it. Known
as MRSA, the strain is most commonly spread on the hands of health
care workers who pick up the microbes on one patient and pass them
to another; about 80,000 patients a year contract it.
</P>
<P>
   When the organism causes pneumonia or gets into the bloodstream
of someone with lowered resistance, it can be lethal. This decade
has seen the emergence of a number of similar hospital-based
mutants spread hand by hand to patient after patient.
</P>
<P>
   Yet experts say too many health care workers are far too casual
about regular hand washing. ``Deep down,'' said Dr. Elaine Larson,
a professor at the Columbia University School of Nursing, who has
studied hand-washing practices for 20 years, ``I think health care
professionals wonder if it really is as important as everybody
says.''
</P>
<P>
   The unpredictable and largely untraceable nature of these
infections also helps keep workers from feeling responsible for any
given case, said Larson. ``Let's say you decided you didn't need to
wash your hands today and a patient doesn't get an infection for a
week. By then they're out of the hospital, so there's very little
link.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no national regulatory requirements for hand-washing
practices at hospitals, clinics and doctors' offices. But the
Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology
recommends a vigorous soaping of 10 to 15 seconds, followed by a
thorough rinse with water before and after contact with body
secretions, mucous membranes or blood.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William Jarvis, chief of the Investigation and Prevention
branch of the Hospital Infections Program at the CDC, recommends
washing hands before and after casual patient contact. He says
patients who have no visible signs of infection may be colonized
with potentially dangerous antibiotic-resistant microbes. ``We
don't know who's colonized or who's not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But complying with these recommendations could mean dozens to
hundreds of hand washings a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to The British Medical Journal challenging
recommendations like Jarvis', Dr. Andrew Weeks, a gynecologist,
wrote that if such compelling evidence existed for the need to wash
hands between each patient contact, ``then why do I and the vast
majority of my colleagues not do it?'' He added, ``I have never
seen any convincing evidence that hand washing between each patient
contact reduces infection rates.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Abdul Zafar, now the director of infection control at
Prince George's Hospital Center in Maryland, has witnessed a
significant outbreak of resistant infections, which he attributed
to inadequate hand-washing. When Zafar worked in Virginia, the
cases developed in the newborn nursery: 22 infants contracted
severe skin infections over the course of three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bacteria cannot jump or fly,'' Zafar said. ``It was
transferred hand to hand from a health care worker.'' The outbreak
ended only when the hospital obtained antibacterial soap that
smelled good and did not dry out the skin.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis was co-author of a report in The Annals of Internal
Medicine this summer about an effort to reduce the incidence of a
hospital-acquired, antibiotic resistant bloodstream infection among
hospitalized cancer patients. Health care workers were monitored to
make sure they were following all guidelines for isolation and
infection control, including hand washing. The incidence of the
infection was reduced by four-fifths.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such evidence, other studies continue to show inadequate
compliance with washing guidelines. Reasons include lack of time,
inaccessible sinks, rough paper towels and chapped hands from
excessive washing. Larson says the nature of hand washing itself _
it is tedious, repetitive and low-tech _ makes it unappealing.
``It's more exciting to put in a cardiac bypass machine than wash
your hands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If efforts to get people to wash their hands fail, why not just
cover up the problem with gloves? Experts agree that proper glove
use works. But in a demonstration of the law of unintended
consequences, because health care workers feel protected, they
often engage in reckless behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of glove use in a long-term care center, researchers
found that gloves were worn 82 percent of the time when their use
was indicated, but changed appropriately only 16 percent of the
time. And a 1997 study in The Journal of Infection Control and
Hospital Epidemiology found that 42 percent of hospital personnel
who touched only the surfaces of the rooms of contaminated patients
ended up with drug-resistant microbes on their gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of health care workers see gloves as protecting
themselves,'' said Weinstein, of Cook County. ``They put them on at
the beginning of the day and don't take them off, which is the same
as not washing your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of a continuing outbreak, there are few
incentives for hospitals to monitor their infection rates
aggressively. In an era of cost containment, Jarvis said, infection
control departments are under pressure to have fewer staff members
because hospital administrators see them as a revenue drain.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't do good surveillance,'' he said, ``you don't
detect infections, which means they don't exist and you look
great.'' The CDC does not require reporting of hospital-acquired
infections; the agency tracks estimated rates through a voluntary
and confidential program involving about 200 hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Even the people who are paying to treat the infections are not
trying to force changes in behavior. ``Right now we're not trying
to do anything about it,'' said Dr. Lee N. Newcomer, a senior vice
president at UnitedHealth Group, a managed care company.
``Hospitals say they are paying attention to this, and I'm sure
many are, but if they're not succeeding, no one cares.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Nielsen, senior vice president for quality leadership at
the American Hospital Association, disagreed with that assessment,
though he acknowledged that hand washing fell below the ideal.
``Hospitals are aware of the danger and are doing everything they
can to prevent infection,'' Neilsen said.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not doing enough for hand-washing advocates like
Larson, who sees great promise in the possible adoption of
waterless, alcohol-based antimicrobial hand rubs, which are widely
used in hospitals in Europe. She says studies show they are just as
effective as hand washing but faster to use and gentler than soap
and water.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Maryanne McGuckin, a senior research investigator at the
University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, wants to turn her
concentration from health care workers to the people who really
care if the hands that touch them are contaminated: the patients.
She has designed a program that gives information packages on the
importance of hand washing to all patients being admitted to the
hospital. Then the patients are instructed to ask each health care
worker who comes into the room, ``Did you wash your hands?''

IN POLICY SHIFT, BIG HMO GIVES FINAL WORD OVER PATIENT CARE TO
DOCTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: 2nd take is scheduled to move by 9:35 p.m. ET) 
(sw) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   United Health Group said on Monday that it was giving
decision-making power over patient care back to physicians,
breaking with a longstanding element of managed care that has
infuriated many doctors and frustrated their patients.
</P>
<P>
   United, one of the nation's biggest managed-care companies, said
that a patient's doctor, not the insurance company, would now be
able to decide without interference whether to admit health plan
members to a hospital or provide other treatment.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the company is giving up cost controls. A
United official said the company already relied primarily on
analyzing the actions of doctors and other providers of care after
the fact, determining averages and urging those who do not conform
to obey guidelines. If persuasion does not work, the ultimate
sanction, which United says is rarely used, is dismissal from the
company's networks, thus forcing patients to transfer to another
physician.
</P>
<P>
   Like other companies, United also negotiates discounts on
payments to doctors and hospitals. And it tries to minimize
expensive hospital stays by reminding members with chronic ailments
like asthma, diabetes and congestive heart failure to take their
medication and closely follow their doctors' orders.
</P>
<P>
   United, which insures 14.5 million people, including 8.7 million
in health maintenance organizations and other managed-care units,
said the new rules were being phased in nationally.
</P>
<P>
   With the decision, United gets a chance to smooth relations with
doctors and patients, attract more customers and perhaps avoid some
future legal liability as health plans battle a backlash against
managed care in Congress and the states and a series of
class-action lawsuits. Those suits generally contend that
managed-care companies misrepresent to customers that they are
getting the best possible care when in fact, the suits say, the
cost of care is the determining factor.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by United is one of several changes by
insurance companies that analysts attribute to the backlash.
United, Aetna Inc. and several Blue Cross plans have separately
offered their members the right to appeal denials of care to an
independent panel outside the company. The panels would be required
in the congressional measures and are already required in 30
states.
</P>
<P>
   And several big nonprofit HMOs, like Kaiser Permanente, based in
California, and Harvard Pilgrim in Boston, have long relied on
doctors to decide when care is considered medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and consumer advocates hailed the move by United on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a response to the consumer and political backlash,'' said
Ken Jacobsen, a health care expert in New York at the Segal Co., a
consulting firm. ``This is a big, significant step.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining its decision to stop requiring doctors to get prior
approval for care, United said it was ``no secret that state and
federal lawmakers want to put an end to much of this practice.''
</P>
<P>
   But officials of the American Association of Health Plans, a
managed-care trade group in Washington, disagreed that the changes
being made by health plans were prompted by developments like the
``patients' rights'' legislation that is awaiting action by a
Senate-House conference committee. Provisions include the right to
sue health plans for medical malpractice, the right to appeal
denials of care to independent review panels and guaranteed access
to specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the trade groups, said the
United announcement was ``the next stage in the evolution of health
care, the edge of a wave of change.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stone, a spokesman for Rep. Charles Norwood, R-Ga., who
sponsored the House bill, said that managed-care companies that
turned over medical decision-making to physicians would not be
liable to medical malpractice lawsuits under the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders in the House and insurance company lobbyists
have argued that the right to sue the companies would increase
costs for health plan members. But Norwood said in a statement on
Monday that his bill would ``very likely result in lower costs.''
He said, ``the best care in the long run is less expensive than
cutting corners.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This action is historic,'' said Dr. Thomas Reardon, president
of the American Medical Association. He said it was ``a long
overdue victory for American patients and the care they receive.''
</P>
<P>
   Health care experts and critics of managed care said the prior
review system had outlived its usefulness and was actually costing
the companies more than they saved. ``This is a confession that HMO
bureaucrats cost more than they save,'' said Jamie Court, a
spokesman for the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a
California-based advocacy coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street investors reacted to the news by driving United
Health Group stock up $2.375, to $54 15/16, Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange.

RESIGNATION LEAVES COCA-COLA ALL WHITE, ALL MALE AT THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (mk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Coca-Cola shuffled its senior management last month, Carl
Ware, a senior vice president responsible for African business, was
told he would no longer report to M. Douglas Ivester, the chairman
and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Ware, the highest-ranking black at the company, was
reassigned to Douglas Daft, another senior vice president whose
portfolio before the announcement consisted of Coke's business in
Asia and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Ware, 56, announced his resignation a week ago, saying he would
leave at the end of next year and that ``this decision reflects
thinking I have been doing for some time.'' He added, ``I've always
made choices based on setting priorities, and my decision to leave
the company is indicative of that.'' He said he would be spending
more time with his wife, his son and his grandchildren. A Coca-Cola
spokesman, Randal Donaldson, characterized the move as a
``retirement 14 months from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ware's departure will result in an entirely white and entirely
male team in charge of operations at the Atlanta-based company.
People who know Ware, a former Atlanta city council member, say his
resignation followed a long period of frustration over his
treatment at the company, where he has worked for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   His decision also comes as Coca-Cola is facing a
racial-discrimination lawsuit brought by four black employees in
April. The lawsuit contends that the plaintiffs were denied
promotions, pay raises and other benefits because of their race.
One prominent civil-rights organizer in Atlanta expressed concern
about Ware's departure but did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola has emphatically denied the allegations in the
lawsuit. After it was filed, Ivester named Ware and Jack Stahl,
another senior vice president, who is white, to lead a diversity
council within the company. Donaldson said Ware would continue to
head the diversity council until his retirement takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   With Ware's resignation, the highest-ranking minority employees
at Coca-Cola are three corporate vice presidents out of 23 total.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a good relationship over time between him and
Ivester,'' said one person who knows Ware. Ware, who did not return
telephone messages left at his office and who was said to be
traveling Monday, was put in charge of the company's African
business by Roberto Goizueta, the chairman and chief executive who
died in October 1997, and Don Keough, Goizueta's longtime No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were his mentors,'' the person continued. ``With
Ivester, there were some very strong discussions regarding
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester praised Ware in the company's statement. ``Carl Ware is
a tremendous asset to me, our Africa business and the Coca-Cola
Co.,'' he said. ``We are fortunate he will remain with us for the
next year to ensure a smooth and successful transition of the
leadership of the group.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Ivester took charge following Goizueta's death, he
presented his own ``Africa Strategy'' to the board of directors.
The strategy called for doubling Coke's sales on the continent by
2002. He also delivered a speech at the World Economic Forum in
Switzerland in which he outlined the company's commitment to
building its business in Africa. ``To be very candid, Africa has
not historically been a real priority for the Coca-Cola Co.,'' he
said. ``But over the past two years, we have come to a very
different perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Ware, the company's volume in Africa, measured in case
sales, remained about 5 percent of the company's worldwide volume.
But its growth was about 7 percent last year. By comparison, the
company's European division reported a 5 percent increase, and the
Middle East and Asian division 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent quarterly filing with regulators shows that
while Coca-Cola's worldwide operating income declined 10 percent in
the first nine months of this year, it declined 19 percent at the
African division. Part of the slide was caused by fluctuating
currencies, meaning case sales were stronger, said Andrew Conway, a
beverage stocks analyst at Morgan Stanley. The company's European
division, which suffered from a recall, fell 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In general, growth of the Africa division has been strong,
Conway added, noting that operating income grew from 24 percent of
sales to 36 percent of sales in just three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl Ware has been a very significant player in advancing
Coke's agenda in Africa,'' Conway said. ``He has been a major part
of the margin expansion and the expansion of Coke's pervasive
distribution on the continent. He's very well known to political
leaders, and has been very successful at establishing relationships
in which Coca-Cola received beneficial tax treatment in exchange
for the building of facilities for use by Africans.''
</P>
<P>
   The management rearrangement seemed an insult to Ware, said the
person who knows him. ``If you know Carl, he's a very, very proud
person,'' he said. ``Daft was his peer. He would perceive that as a
negative.''

EDUCATION IS A STICKING POINT IN NEGOTIATIONS ON SPENDING BILLS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress and the White House met late into Monday
night on the long-overdue spending bills, after fighting a verbal
war all day over education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides planned to confront issues in two politically
problematic bills, one financing education, labor and health
programs and the other for the Commerce, Justice and State
departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a big difference of opinion on education,'' said
President Clinton, challenging Congress to pass his $1.4 billion
provision to help hire 100,000 new teachers and reduce class sizes
in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton calls the plan one of his most important goals. He wants
the money spent entirely on hiring teachers, and he and aides say
he will not compromise. Republicans want instead to give $1.2
billion to states and their school boards to spend as they please
on books, computers and teachers, or other needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about the money,'' said Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott of Mississippi. ``The big issue is, who controls it?''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., asked, ``Is every school district in
the United States going to be run by the president?''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., the chairman in charge of the
spending bill governing education, health and labor programs, said
he had little desire to deal with a president making ultimatums.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any room for compromise as long as the president
says it's nonnegotiable,'' Specter said. He called the White
House's negotiating stance unconstitutional and said the two sides
were still more than $2 billion apart on the education, health and
labor bill, a figure the White House confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, there were offers and counteroffers between
the White House and the Republican leadership, but no deals were
made on the five unresolved spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we do it all by Wednesday? In a heartbeat, if we work
together,'' Clinton said. But, instead, the noise level of the
arguments over billions of dollars and crucial paragraphs of
legislative language increased.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said the White House might still have to agree to an
across-the-board spending cut of less than 1 percent to make sure
the Republican-written spending bills do not draw on Social
Security funds.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have staked their fiscal and political
reputations on meeting that goal. Clinton last week vetoed an
across-the-board cut of .97 percent, denouncing it as ``blind'' and
``mindless.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott said Congress ``absolutely, absolutely'' would insist on
the across-the-board cut if necessary. ``We have to look at all the
numbers and see how they add up,'' he said. ``And if there's any
chance that it would dip into the Social Security trust fund, we
should have an across-the-board cut.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And a new potential obstacle loomed. Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West
Virginia, the ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee,
wants a new law favoring his state's coal miners added to the
legislative stew before Congress adjourns.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd wants to overturn a federal judge's ruling, handed down
last month, that said the state had violated clean water laws by
letting coal companies clog hundreds of miles of streams with fill
dumped from mountainsides.
</P>
<P>
   To bring that provision to the floor, Byrd threatened to block
the $15.3 billion foreign operations bill passed by the House on
Friday. He lifted that threat Monday night, and his office said he
would declare his intentions on Tuesday. But the rest of the
unresolved spending bills remain potential legislative vehicles for
his effort.
</P>
<P>
   One of those bills, relatively small, contains federal money for
the District of Columbia and is all but finished and ready for the
president's signature. A second, covering the Interior Department,
still has provisions favoring the oil, gas and mining industries
that are objectionable to environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the big dispute over education programs. And the
bill financing the Commerce, Justice and State departments is in
limbo, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher H. Smith, R-N.J., wants language in the bill
blocking federal funds from going to any organizations that seeks
to change abortion laws overseas. He has attached that to the
section of the bill that would allow the United States to pay the
$1 billion in dues it owes the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dues issue should be resolved in an appropriate way,''
Lott said. ``The administration needs to come to grips with some
limitations on taxpayer dollars being spent to lobby for abortion
around the world.''

   Robert Hoehn, a Wall Street health care analyst with ING
Barings, said the higher stock price may reflect the belief of
traders that the new policy would give United ``an advantage over
other companies in terms of marketing'' and ``further insulate them
from the risk of litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Archelle Georgiou, chief medical officer of United said the
company had been spending $100 million a year to respond to
requests for approval of care, which were almost always granted.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the money saved will go toward programs for patients,
she said, like telling patients what to expect in the hospital and
keeping tabs on them so they get appropriate care promptly and can
return home.
</P>
<P>
   The company will still track doctors' decisions after they are
made and urge nonconforming doctors to follow the company's
guidelines. ``When we are talking to physicians and not calling to
deny a service, they are so much more willing to listen,'' Dr.
Georgiou said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors will still have to be mindful of economic outcomes,''
Jacobsen, the consultant said. And the companies will still be
negotiating with the doctors and hospital on price.
</P>
<P>
   Hoehn, the analyst, said managed care had succeeded in bringing
health costs down. Fifteen years ago, he said, reviews like those
being dropped by United, played an important role in holding down
costs. ``Now quality and access to care are taking precedence,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other managed care companies declined to comment on the United
announcement, which was reported Monday in The Dallas Morning News.
Spokeswomen for Oxford Health Plans, Aetna U.S. Healthcare, and
Empire Blue Cross said they had not seen a full and official
account by United.

 Levi's Chief of Marketing Will Resign  &HT;     By Carol Emert 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Gordon Shank, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.'s chief marketing officer and one
of the last members of its old-guard leadership, is leaving the
company after 25 years.
<P>
   In a memo circulated yesterday among Levi's employees, Chairman
Robert Haas said Shank and Philip Marineau, the company's new chief
executive officer, ``have agreed that (Shank's) CMO position is
redundant and unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Marineau, a former PepsiCo executive who was brought aboard in
September, will assume Shank's duties. The CMO position, which was
created for Shank last spring, will be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Shank and Marineau ``believe strongly that the steward of the
company's vision and strategic marketing direction should be the
chief executive officer,'' Haas' memo stated. ``Regretfully, we do
not have any other open positions that match Gord's experience,
stature and interests, so he will be leaving the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the official verbiage, Levi's watchers said that the CMO
job was largely a toothless position and that yesterday's
announcement didn't surprise anyone, including Shank.
</P>
<P>
   As chief marketing officer, Shank had little role in developing
or approving advertising. The company's top ad executives reported
directly to the chiefs of its three global divisions, bypassing
Shank.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions about Shank's prowess are mixed. Although Levi's
advertising generally has been considered strong over the years,
campaigns for the past three years have received a tepid response
from consumers and done little to halt Levi's hemorrhaging sales.
</P>
<P>
   Shank is regarded by some Levi's observers as a key member of a
generation of leaders who joined Levi's in the 1970s and presided
at the top as it headed toward three-straight years of serious
sales shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Other senior managers of that era who have left the company in
recent years include Peter Jacobi, Tom Fanoe, George Porter, Thomas
Tusher and Robert Rockey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other company insiders believe that Shank was a strong
marketer and an important asset to Levi's. ``Gord was the one
person (among top management) who had any strategic vision for the
company,'' said one.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Shank's fate was sealed this fall when Levi's
decided to pull the plug on its e-commerce business, Shank's pet
project.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview yesterday, Shank defended his tenure as
CMO. ``My job was to help facilitate, oversee, counsel and guide''
rather than be involved in day-to-day operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shank acknowledged that the company has ``stumbled'' in its
recent U.S. advertising campaigns as it has been ``trying to find
its way. ... We'd be hard pressed to say anything we're doing is
working tremendously well when the company is at the point where it
is,'' Shank said.
</P>
<P>
   Shank, who joined the company as a salesman in his native Canada
in 1974, will leave the company by the end of the month and take
several months off to ``decompress,'' he said. Then he will look
for a CEO job, something he once believed he might attain at
Levi's.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist Convention, the United States' largest
Protestant denomination, has always proclaimed that it had a
mission to reach out to people worldwide to urge them to a belief
in Jesus Christ as the Messiah. But new efforts it has undertaken,
aimed at converting Jews and Hindus, have generated a backlash from
members of those faiths.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, in an unusual display of unity between Orthodox and
non-Orthodox Jewish leaders, the heads of the four major Jewish
theological seminaries, together with officers of an umbrella
organization representing more than 60 Jewish groups, sent a letter
to the Southern Baptist president, the Rev. Paige Patterson, asking
the denomination to stop supporting ``deceptive'' tactics to
convert Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The letter represents an increasing concern among Jewish
organizations over an issue that has set Jews at odds with leaders
of the nation's nearly 16 million Southern Baptists.
</P>
<P>
   The letter, written on the stationery of the umbrella group, the
Jewish Community Relations Council of New York, asserted that the
denomination had endorsed a form of proselytizing in which Jewish
symbols and rituals were ``expropriated for the sake of converting
Jews'' _ a reference to Southern Baptist support for ``messianic
Jewish'' organizations that use prayer shawls and skullcaps in
services that center on the worship of Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The letter coincidentally followed a demonstration on Sunday by
about 100 Hindus outside a Southern Baptist church in Houston. The
demonstrators were protesting a Southern Baptist booklet asking
prayer for the conversion of Hindus, whom it described as ``lost in
the hopeless darkness'' of their faith.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer guide, published to coincide with Divali, the Hindu
festival of lights, was the third such document produced by the
Southern Baptists' International Missions Board in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, the board published a guide for use during the
Jewish High Holy Days, asking Southern Baptists to pray for Jews'
conversion. A guide asking Southern Baptists to pray for the
conversion of Muslims was published earlier. In an article posted
on its Internet site, the mission board said a fourth guide, on
Buddhism, was planned.
</P>
<P>
   The prayer guide on Jews encourages Southern Baptists to tell
Jewish friends they would not cease being Jewish if they converted
to a belief in Jesus Christ. That position has been rejected by
Jewish leaders, and the signers of the letter to Patterson restated
their objection, saying that ``those who adopt another religion
discard any true connection with their Jewish faith and heritage.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter stated: ``Our quarrel with the Southern Baptist
Convention is not over its right to proselytize. Rather, the Jewish
community is deeply offended that the SBC has formally embraced a
strategy that attempts to deceive Jews into believing that one can
be both a Jew and a Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter was signed by Rabbi Norman Lamm, president of the
Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary at Yeshiva University, an
Orthodox institution; Rabbi Ismar Schorsch, chancellor of the
Jewish Theological Seminary, a Conservative institution; Rabbi
David Teutsch, president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical
College, and Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman, president of the Hebrew Union
College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which trains men and women
for the Reform rabbinate.
</P>
<P>
   It was also signed by Gedale Horowitz and Michael Miller,
president and executive vice president, respectively, of the Jewish
Community Relations Council, whose members include such
organizations as the American Jewish Committee, the American Jewish
Congress, B'nai B'rith and others.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on the relative rarity of collaboration by Jewish
leaders across all denominational lines, Miller said the letter was
prompted by a broad concern that Southern Baptists, as ``a
mainstream faith group,'' were supporting an approach to conversion
that alarms many Jews. It is, he said, ``a communal response to a
significant challenge to the integrity of our faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamm said he would give the same advice to Southern Baptists
that he had given to some Jewish groups, to reach out religiously
to their own people before they try to reach others. Of the
Southern Baptists' support for messianic organizations, he said,
``The effort smacks of imperialism, which should have no place in
the world of religious discourse.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter follows a written exchange six weeks ago between
Patterson and Philip Abramowitz, director of the council's task
force on missionaries and cults. Then, Abramowitz wrote to
Patterson, protesting his involvement in a conference on
evangelizing Jews that was held in New York with leaders of
messianic groups that say one can be Jewish and also accept Jesus
as the Messiah.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, Patterson said the accusation that Southern Baptists
had been using deception to win converts was ``false and
reckless,'' and that Southern Baptists believed in ``absolute
religious liberty'' and freedom from coercion.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from Florida, where he was traveling
Monday, Patterson said he had not yet seen the letter. But he said,
``Show me a single case where a Southern Baptist has acted
deceptively and I will do my best to see it never happens again. We
are not a deceptive people.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, he did not believe that ``Hebrew
Christians,'' another name for messianic Jews, were being deceptive
in their use of Jewish ritual objects together with declarations of
a belief in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now what would be deceptive is if you're not telling people
where you stand and what you believe,'' Patterson said. ``Just to
hold onto factors in their Jewish background like prayer shawls, as
long as they're out in the open, I'm afraid I don't see that as
deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Southern Baptists' prayer guide on Hinduism, Dr. Uma
Mysorekar, secretary-treasurer of the Council of Hindu Temples of
North America, said she was ``deeply saddened'' by what she called
a mockery of Hindu prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important point is that Hindus are proud of what they
are and they are also proud of their form of worship,'' said Dr.
Mysorekar, who is also president of the Hindu Temple Society of
North America, a temple in New York. She added that Hindu leaders
were ``willing to have a dialogue'' with Southern Baptist officials
``and to teach them what Hinduism stands for.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 ON TECHNOLOGY/HENRY NORR  &HT;     Microsoft Findings Brilliantly Insightful 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Unless you've kept your head in several feet of sand since Friday,
you know by now that Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's ``findings of
fact'' in the Department of Justice's antitrust suit against
Microsoft were blunt, biting, even blistering.
<P>
   What you might not realize, unless you've taken the time to slog
through the 207-page document, is that it's also brilliant.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, parts of it are debatable, and not just by Microsoft's
lawyers. But overall, it adds up to a subtle and remarkably
insightful analysis of the software marketplace and Microsoft's
behavior over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson even learned to sling around industry jargon and
acronyms with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   The achievement is all the more remarkable when you consider
that the judge apparently knew next to nothing about the computer
business before taking on the case. Undoubtedly, he has some sharp
young law clerks helping him out, and perhaps they deserve much of
the credit; some of the arguments were also supplied to him by the
government's lawyers and witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   But it's Jackson who put it all together into a persuasive
narrative. Although the document's title _ ``findings of fact'' _
and its form _ 410 numbered paragraphs _ might suggest nothing more
than a potpourri of judgments about the wide variety of factual
questions raised in the trial, it's actually a coherent
interpretive essay.
</P>
<P>
   From start to finish, the document's central organizing
principle is what Jackson first calls the ``chicken-and-egg
problem,'' before switching to a more decorous term for the same
idea: the ``applications barrier to entry.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Jackson explains what he means (on Page 14 of the
document):
</P>
<P>
   ``The overwhelming majority of consumers will only use a PC
operating system for which there already exists a large and varied
set of high-quality, full-featured applications and for which it
seems relatively certain that new types of applications and new
versions of existing applications will continue to be marketed at a
pace with those written for other operating systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The other side of that coin, from the perspective of software
developers: ``Software developers generally write applications
first, and often exclusively, for the operating system that is
already used by a dominant share of all PC users.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ideas are by no means original _ in fact, they sound like
hollow truisms. But in Jackson's hands, they're the threads that
tie together what otherwise might look like unrelated episodes.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, in analyzing Microsoft's responses to a long list
of industry innovations _ above the Netscape Navigator browser and
Sun Microsystems' Java development technology, but also including
initiatives from IBM, Apple, Real Networks and even Intel,
Microsoft's partner in the ``Wintel'' axis _ Jackson looks behind
Microsoft's belligerent bullying and finds a systematic campaign to
protect that ``applications barrier to entry.''
</P>
<P>
   Using Microsoft execs' own e-mail messages, among other
evidence, the judge shows that Chairman Bill Gates and his
colleagues saw each of the disputed technologies as a threat, of
one degree or another, because each raised the prospect that
developers would step up production of applications not tied
specifically to Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of the long document, like the majority of the
witnesses at the trial, addresses the Netscape case. It's no secret
that Microsoft, from the moment it learned that Netscape was
developing a Web browser for Windows 95, made every effort to
squash the product.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson details that effort in excruciating detail, showing how
Microsoft threatened to deny even its No.1 customer, Compaq, access
to Windows if it didn't stop distributing Navigator; how the
company threatened to cancel Microsoft Office for the Macintosh
simply because Apple, while distributing both browsers, was giving
top billing to Navigator; and how Microsoft coerced 14 of the 15
top Internet access providers in North America to make Internet
Explorer their standard, even when it meant compensating them for
breaking contracts with Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson doesn't quote the Microsoft executive who allegedly
threatened that his company would ``cut off (Netscape's) air
supply,'' but the facts he cites are more damaging than any
rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   What made Netscape such a threat was not that it was a popular
application, but that it threatened to become what the industry
calls a ``platform'' _ an environment in which other developers can
create a variety of applications. Since Netscape was writing
versions of Navigator for the Mac, Unix and other computer systems,
and integrating them all with Sun's platform-agnostic Java
environment, continuing success for Netscape could have created a
compelling alternative to Windows in the eyes of software
developers.
</P>
<P>
   That's why Gates et al were so determined to stop it. To a very
large degree, they succeeded. But now that Judge  &LR; Jackson has so
perceptively exposed their game plan, their response may yet come
back to haunt them.

 Microsoft to Reboot MSN Site, Capitulate in AOL Struggle  &HT;     By Tom Stein 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In an effort to finally capture the hearts and wallets of Web
surfers, Microsoft Corp. will relaunch its MSN.com portal site
today.
<P>
   The redesign of the MSN site, which trails in popularity behind
Yahoo and America Online, also carries broader implications in
terms of Microsoft's continuing instant-messaging struggle with
America Online and Friday's antitrust finding against the software
titan.
</P>
<P>
   MSN.com attracts 28.2 million visitors a month, compared with
32.1 million visitors for Yahoo, which is the most frequented site
on the Net, and 28.4 million for second-place AOL, according to
Internet research firm Media Metrix. But these numbers do not tell
the full story. MSN.com is the default home page for the Internet
Explorer Web browser, so many people automatically go to the site
whether they want to or not.
</P>
<P>
   MSN.com has gone through many iterations since it first went
online in the mid-90s, but Microsoft executives say they finally
have created a site that will appeal to consumers. It will include
the standard news, weather and entertainment content, as well as
e-commerce links and such new features as MSN Web Communities, an
area for affinity groups.
</P>
<P>
   For example, with MSN Web Communities, a local soccer club can
create its own Web page _ complete with a schedule of game times,
photo album and message boards _ to stay in constant communication.
</P>
<P>
   The site also features a new version of MSN Messenger Service,
Microsoft's instant-chat software that alerts Web surfers when
their friends are online and then allows them to communicate by
typing and sending text messages in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The first version of MSN Messenger also allowed users to chat
with friends using AOL's competing software. But Microsoft is, at
least for now, admitting defeat and ending its interoperability
tussle with AOL, which reigns supreme in instant messaging, with
about 65 million users.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft did not even have a messaging product until July but
now says it has 4 million users.
</P>
<P>
   AOL was outraged when Microsoft first introduced its product.
AOL argued that Microsoft was gaining unauthorized access to its
subscriber lists and consequently blocked MSN Messenger customers
from communicating with its user base. Microsoft, for its part,
kept looking for new ways to worm its way into AOL's messaging
service. But now the company has backed down completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no interoperability for now,'' said Deanna
Sanford, lead project for MSN. ``We are still exploring our best
alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe that the ``best alternative'' rests in the
hands of the Internet Engineering Task Force, an independent body
that is trying to create a common standard that would allow all
instant-messaging products to interoperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still months away from any kind of standard,'' said Rob
Enderle, an Internet analyst with Giga Information Group.
``Microsoft realized its cat-and-mouse game with AOL was
aggravating users and wasn't doing good for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe Microsoft has other problems with MSN.com _
namely, that it comes off as a cold, corporate Web site that holds
limited appeal to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Yahoo or AOL, MSN.com is not a friendly destination
where people go to hang out,'' said Barry Parr, an analyst with
International Data Corp. ``Microsoft is great in the corporate
market, but they have never been really good at marketing products
and services to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   At least on the Internet, Microsoft is far from a monopoly. But
Friday's antitrust ruling could have a significant impact on MSN.
For one thing, analysts say, it will be a lot harder for Microsoft
to make an acquisition that would allow it to compete on equal
footing with the likes of Yahoo or AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Also, if Microsoft ultimately is forced to remove its Internet
Explorer Web browser from its Windows operating system, the MSN
site would suffer because, as the default home page for Internet
Explorer, it likely would attract fewer visitors.

 Providian Drops 23% on News of Another Probe  &HT;     By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The Connecticut attorney general's office said yesterday that it is
investigating business practices of Providian Financial, opening
another front in the credit card giant's legal troubles and
prompting panicky investors to dump the company's stock.
<P>
   Shares of Providian, the nation's sixth-largest Visa and
MasterCard issuer, plummeted $26.25 to close at $89.25 after the
company disclosed the probe. The stock's 23 percent plunge wiped
out nearly $4 billion in market value.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said yesterday
that his office was investigating Providian's credit card practices
in response to consumer complaints.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general issued a statement noting that ``complaints
against Providian include failure to credit payments in a timely
manner to customer accounts, charges for unauthorized services and
inadequate disclosure of interest rates and fees.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Providian specializes in issuing credit cards to
customers who previously have had problems paying debts.
</P>
<P>
   Providian spokesman Konrad Alt said the Connecticut attorney
general's office on Friday sent a formal demand for answers to 15
questions about the company's business practices. ``We will respond
appropriately and cooperatively,'' Alt said.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Blumenthal met with Providian general counsel Ellen
Richey, who promised to cooperate with the attorney general,
according to both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Connecticut investigation is the latest of several official
probes into charges that San Francisco's Providian sold customers
products they hadn't requested, failed to disclose terms adequately
and added improper fees to customer bills.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Providian said it was holding talks to settle a San
Francisco district attorney's office investigation of alleged
unfair-business practices. In August, Providian said the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency, the federal agency that regulates
nationally chartered banks, was examining the company's consumer
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The company also faces a series of private lawsuits seeking
class-action status in state and federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   Providian has not admitted any wrongdoing but has changed some
of its business practices. For example, after customers complained
they were hit with late fees even though they paid on time, the
company began offering a three-day grace period for payments before
imposing charges.
</P>
<P>
   The free-fall in Providian's stock erased sharp gains posted
during the past two weeks. Until yesterday, strong profit reports
plus news of settlement talks with the San Francisco district
attorney's office had convinced many investors that the company's
legal problems were under control.
</P>
<P>
   Now ``investors are totally exasperated,'' said Mark Alpert, an
analyst with the investment bank Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. ``Even
if they settle with the D.A., does it mean they also have to settle
with Connecticut or whoever else comes up?''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Providian's stock also was hurt by a disclosure
that chief executive Shailesh Mehta had sold nearly 113,000 shares
of the company's stock for about $12.5 million last week before the
Connecticut probe was made public.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the sale ``could not have been worse,'' CIBC World
Markets analyst Steven Eisman wrote in a note to investors
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The sale ``was made for personal financial reasons and was
planned well in advance,'' Providian's Alt said.

 MONEYBAG/ARTHUR M. LOUIS  &HT;     For Indexes, Trusts Beat Funds 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Q: My husband and I are conservative investors, so we are willing
to put our money into investments that track the stock-market
averages, rather than trying to beat the market. We are considering
investments that track the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, the Dow Jones
industrials and the Nasdaq 100. We wonder if you could discuss the
pros and cons of investing in index mutual funds versus investing
in the index trusts traded on the American Stock Exchange.
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A: OK.
</P>
<P>
   But first you should understand that investing in the stock
market _ whether through individual stocks, index funds or index
trusts _ is not what most people consider conservative. In
particular, an investment in the red-hot, highly volatile Nasdaq
100 is anything but conservative, even though it has been a great
performer over the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative investors usually put a significant amount of money
into U.S. Treasuries to provide safe income and low volatility when
the stock market gets caught in its occasional downdrafts.
</P>
<P>
   As for index funds versus index trusts, the trusts seem to have
the edge.
</P>
<P>
   For short-term traders, they offer greater flexibility than
mutual funds because they trade as stocks. You can move in and out
during the day and sell them short _ neither of which you can do
with funds.
</P>
<P>
   For long-term traders, the chief advantage is that the trusts
charge rock-bottom management fees _ generally less than 0.2
percent of assets per year. Some index mutual funds also charge
very little, but others charge as much as 1 percent and more. Over
the long run, that can chip away a substantial portion of your
investment.
</P>
<P>
   The principal index trusts are the S&AMP;P 500 Depositary Receipt
(ticker symbol: SPY); the Diamonds Trust (DIA), which tracks the
Dow; and the Nasdaq-100 Shares Trust (QQQ). You can buy or sell
them at the prevailing price any time during trading hours through
any stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Capital Gain
</P>
<P>
   Q: I own shares in a tax-free mutual fund, which invests in
municipal bonds. I have the fund managers automatically reinvest my
tax-exempt dividends in more shares. However, that seems to pose a
complication: If I were to sell some shares at a profit, how would
I calculate my capital gain for tax purposes, considering that part
of the gain is generated by tax-free dividends?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The calculation is fairly simple, says Internal Revenue Service
spokesman Jesse Weller. Whatever amount of tax-free income you
invest in new shares is added to your cost basis on the shares you
own.
</P>
<P>
   For example, suppose you own $10,000 worth of a tax-free fund's
shares, of which $2,000 is a capital gain and $8,000 is your cost
basis. You then invest $500 of tax-free dividends in more shares.
Now you have $10,500 worth of shares, but your cost basis moves up
to $8,500, so the capital gain remains unchanged. Which is another
way of saying that your dividends will remain untaxed.
</P>
<P>
   If your new, $500 investment grows in value, however, the
increase will be considered part of your capital-gains liability
and will be taxed when you sell your shares.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Work Expenses
</P>
<P>
   Q: For about three months during 1996, I worked in New Mexico at
the request of my employer. The employer paid me my usual salary,
but I had to pay my own expenses, totaling $3,000, for travel, a
temporary apartment, etc. Were these expenses tax-deductible, and
if so, can I still take advantage of this? I didn't claim them at
the time. Also, would it make a difference if my wife and I filed
an amended return separately, rather than the joint return we filed
originally?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: It's not too late to act, because your 1996 return was due in
April 1997, and you have three years beyond that to file an amended
return and claim a refund. So get it done by next April.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you could do better by filing separately rather than
jointly is irrelevant at this point, says IRS spokesman Weller,
because you have to stick with the joint return once you've passed
the original (April 1997) due date.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you'll want to do is determine whether your
itemized deductions, including those you are adding, exceed the
standard deduction for the 1996 tax year. That figure was $6,700
for married couples filing a joint return. If you can't top that by
itemizing, then there is no point in filing an amended return.
</P>
<P>
   To file an amended return, you will need Form 1040X, and you
also must file Form 2106, detailing your travel expenses. The
overall job-related deduction can be claimed on Schedule A, under
the heading `'Job Expenses and Most Other Miscellaneous
Deductions.'' Bear in mind that deductions claimed in this section
of the form can be used only to the extent that they exceed 2
percent of your adjusted gross income.
</P>
<P>
   You can claim your expenses for travel to and from New Mexico,
your commuting expenses while there, your rental costs, cleaning
bills, telephone bills, tips and up to half the actual cost of your
meals. If you don't have meal receipts, you can deduct up to half
the maximum IRS-mandated meal allowance, which ranged from $26 to
$38 per day in New Mexico in 1996, depending on the town.
</P>
<P>
   For a full discussion of allowable deductions, get IRS
Publication 463, entitled ``Travel, Entertainment, Gift and Car
Expenses.''

HOW TO ELUDE PESKY ATM FEES  &HT;     BY SAM ZUCKERMAN
</HEADLINE>
 _ SF CHRON   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
San Francisco's just-approved ballot measure to ban ATM surcharges
caused the fur to fly in the city.
<P>
   Consumer groups blasted banks for gouging customers. Bankers
accused fee critics of inflaming public passions against reasonable
charges for convenient ATM access.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as they were at each other's throats, the two sides
agreed on one point _ there are plenty of steps consumers can take
to avoid ATM fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do have alternatives,'' said Greg Wilhelm, an official
of the California Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   That's important because San Francisco's surcharge ban, as well
as a similar measure recently approved by the Santa Monica City
Council, might not stand up in court. Big banks and the CBA are
suing in federal court to overturn San Francisco's law before it
takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, there now are no bans on ATM surcharges in
California outside San Francisco and Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   So, what are fee-hating consumers to do when they need cash
fast?
</P>
<P>
   First, it's important to know that ATM fees come in two
varieties. One is the fee that your own bank, thrift or credit
union charges when you use a cash machine belonging to another
institution. In California, that fee typically is $2.
</P>
<P>
   The second fee is the ATM surcharge, the fee that the outside
bank charges noncustomers who use their machines, typically $1.50
in the state. Only that second surcharge is banned under the San
Francisco and Santa Monica laws.
</P>
<P>
   Add the two fees together and you come up with a combined charge
of $3.50 for withdrawing money from a cash machine not owned by
your own financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate the fees,'' said Aileen Agricola, a South San Francisco
resident who works as program director at a nonprofit Web site in
the city. ``If it's necessary, I'll go out of my way to avoid
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Eluding the first fee, the one banks charge their own customers
for using somebody else's ATMs, is easy. Keep your money at an
institution that doesn't impose that fee.
</P>
<P>
   Many small banks and credit unions don't charge for using an
outside cash machine, sacrificing the revenue in order to compete
with big banks that have vast ATM networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburban banks that have a lot of customers who are
commuters feel they have to'' offer free access to outside ATMs,
said CBA spokesman John Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   Avoiding the second fee, the one the ATM owner slaps on
noncustomers, is a little harder. The basic rule is simple: Use
ATMs belonging to your own financial institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get an account at a bank that has ATMs that are convenient to
you,'' said David Sorkin, a law professor at the John Marshall Law
School in Chicago who operates an Internet site on ATM fees,
www.atmsurchages.com.
</P>
<P>
   Still it isn't always easy to find your own bank's ATMs. Here
are some tips for dodging that annoying ding at the cash machine.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Consider doing business with a big bank. Bank of America has 4,133
ATMs in California and about 14,000 in the West and Southeast.
Wells Fargo has 2,876 machines in the state and 6,500 throughout
the West and Midwest. Those far-flung networks usually make their
ATMs easy to find, especially in California.
</P>
<P>
   If one of the big banks has cash machines near where you live
and work, keeping your money with them might be the best way to
avoid ATM fees.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this advice contradicts the previous recommendation
to use an institution that doesn't levy a fee for using outside
ATMs. Both Bank of America and Wells Fargo sock account holders
with $2 charges for using another institution's cash machines. So
only bank with them if you have the discipline to stick with their
ATMs most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Find a bank that will rebate surcharges. Many banks don't charge
for using outside cash machines. Some go further, actually
refunding the second fee, the surcharge levied by the ATM owners.
</P>
<P>
   Most banks operating exclusively on the Internet, such as
Telebank, refund ATM surcharges because, as Web-based institutions,
they don't have cash machines. Some suburban banks do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, for example, Richmond's Mechanics Bank, with
extensive operations in the East Bay, rebates $6 to $9 per month in
outside ATM surcharges, depending on account type, to customers who
meet minimum balance requirements. Bank of Fremont, with branches
from Danville to Carmel, rebates up to five surcharges per
statement period, regardless of amount.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Look for ATMs that don't impose surcharges. Nationwide, about 4
out of 5 banks impose surcharges, but that still leaves plenty of
cash machines that don't sock consumers. In the Bay Area, most
credit unions and many small banks let noncustomers use their ATMs
for free.
</P>
<P>
   Find ATMs with ``No Surcharge'' logos at locations convenient to
you and use them regularly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Consider alternatives to ATMs when you need cash. It wasn't so
long ago when people cashed checks at the supermarket when they
needed money. You still can do that for no cost at many stores.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, there may be another tool in your wallet or
purse. If your ATM card has a Visa or MasterCard logo on it, it's
also a debit card that you can use to buy products and services,
subtracting the cost directly from your checking account. At
thousands of stores, you can debit more than the cost of the item
you're buying and get the difference in cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers can take their ATM card and get cash back at no
cost, right at the point of sale,'' said CBA's Wilhelm.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Cash checks when traveling. It can be especially hard to find a
free ATM when you're on the road. Take your checkbook. Your hotel
or airline probably will cash checks for free.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Avoid ATMs that don't belong to financial institutions. Cash
machines that don't belong to banks, thrifts or credit unions _ the
kinds often found in gas stations, convenience stores, supermarkets
and casinos _ frequently are rip-offs charging as much as $5 or $6
to withdraw cash. Steer clear of high-priced ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_Withdraw large sums. OK, you're a hopeless ATM junkie. You don't
plan ahead. When you're wallet is empty, you just go to the nearest
machine and rack up the fees.
</P>
<P>
   One woman, who asked to remain nameless, confessed to paying $30
to $40 in ATM fees every month. Guess what. She often took out only
$20.
</P>
<P>
   If you are hooked, withdraw more money every time you hit the
cash machine. If you take out $80 instead of $40, you'll cut the
fees you pay in half.

 &HT;    Postal worker accused of theft
 &HT;    By Thomas R. Collins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT PIERCE, Fla. _ Luxury combined with technology to nab a
Stuart, Fla., postal worker accused of stealing mail when an
electronic transmitter in a Cartier watch led inspectors to the
getaway car.
</P>
<P>
   John Bruce Cooper of Stuart was charged Friday with embezzlement
of a first-class parcel, according to a criminal complaint filed
Monday in federal court in Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Suspecting that Cooper had been stealing mail at the main post
office in Stuart, a U.S. postal inspector mailed a Cartier watch
containing ``an electronic beacon transmitter which enables
inspectors to track the parcel,'' the complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   At 10:30 a.m. Friday, the regular mail carrier marked the parcel
``no such number'' and left it for further processing.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour later, Cooper allegedly took it to a part of the
post office where workers handle mail that can't be delivered
because of incorrect, illegible, or insufficient addresses, the
complaint says.
</P>
<P>
   At about noon, Cooper waited for a co-worker to leave, then put
the parcel under his desk.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:30 p.m., he got his lunch and ``proceeded to end his tour
of duty,'' leaving the post office in his Toyota Camry station
wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their bug, inspectors knew he had the watch with him
and stopped him near U.S. 1, according to the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The identifiable first-class parcel was discovered rifled and
in plain view on the front passenger seat next to Cooper's lunch
bucket,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   Postal authorities also found two credit cards not in Cooper's
name in his lunch bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Postal officials were unavailable for comment Monday afternoon.

SALE OF SHARES GREATLY EXCEEDS HONG KONG'S GOAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In another boost to this economically resurgent
city, Hong Kong's government has raised far more money than
expected from an offering of shares it bought last year in a costly
market intervention.
</P>
<P>
   The offering, called the Tracker Fund of Hong Kong, raised $4.3
billion Monday, more than triple the government's target price of
$1.3 billion. That makes it the largest stock offering in the
history of the Hong Kong stock exchange _ ahead even of the China
Telecom offering in October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the offering confounded analysts here, who
predicted that investors would shun a fund that tracks the
performance of Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index. While some of
the success was attributed to the pricing of the fund, it was also
a powerful vote of confidence in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The short answer is: I'm surprised by the level of
enthusiasm,'' said Adrian Faure, a strategist at Merrill Lynch in
Hong Kong. ``They've clearly done a great deal better than they
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund was priced at a 5.25 percent discount to the trading
price of the Hang Seng index. Investors will also receive bonus
shares for holding the shares more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The offering comes at a time when Hong Kong, after two years of
economic anguish, is on something of a roll. Last week, Walt Disney
Co. announced that it would build its third overseas theme park
here. And the offering follows a successful $2 billion secondary
stock offering by China Telecom.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had launched this last summer, when things looked bad
in Asia, there would not have been much interest,'' said Marc
Faber, the head of his own investment firm here and another
surprised skeptic. ``But now everyone thinks the bad news is over,
and there are only good times ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tracker Fund is an outgrowth of one of the darkest episodes
of the Asian financial crisis: Hong Kong's decision to buy $15
billion worth of shares to foil currency traders whom it accused of
trying to undermine the stock and currency markets during the
financial turmoil in August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The government declared victory in that battle, but was left
holding a huge portfolio of stock in companies like HSBC Holdings
and China Telecom. While the value of the shares rose along with
Asia's rebounding markets, analysts feared that the government
would not be able to sell the stock at a decent price.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong officials considered their options for months before
deciding to package the shares in a fund that would track the Hang
Seng index. The offering priced Monday is only the government's
first batch of shares. The total value of Hong Kong's portfolio is
roughly $22 billion, which analysts expect the government to
whittle away over the next decade through stock offerings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these shares, the Chinese government hopes to
issue stock in several of its largest state-owned companies,
including China National Petroleum, China Petrochemical and the
Bank of China. Analysts calculate that those offerings will have a
total value of more than $20 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of all those shares flooding the market has
dampened some analysts' enthusiasm. They say Hong Kong's stock
market will not be able to soak up the surfeit of equity without
depressing the price of existing stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For people here, however, the security of investing in Hong Kong
seemed to outweigh concerns about a glut of shares. Residents
flocked to local banks for applications. Bill Choy, who runs a
garment-trading business, said, ``I don't trust fund managers, but
it's the government, so I have more confidence in it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bankers said people were attracted by the discount, the savvy
marketing of the fund and perhaps the changing outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hong Kong has a reputation for short-term traders,'' said Jim
Sheridan, the head of equities at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which
co-managed the offering with ING Barings and Jardine Fleming. ``But
this came at a time when Hong Kong investors are questioning what
was their primary investment vehicle _ land.''
</P>
<P>
   When institutional investors saw that the fund was a hit, they
bought heavily as well. But overseas hedge funds, which the
government accused of manipulating the market during last year's
turmoil, were allocated relatively few shares in the fund,
according to an executive familiar with the process.
</P>
<P>
   Faber noted that the fund was still overly vulnerable to
property developers, which have performed poorly. But as China's
state companies issue shares, several are likely to be added to the
Hang Seng index. That will change the complexion of Hong Kong's
market, making it less sensitive to the property market and more
reliant on corporate reforms in China.

AGENCY CALLED LAX IN WATCHING BANKS FOR MONEY LAUNDERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A key regulatory agency has been lax in monitoring banks for
possible money laundering abuses, according to a preliminary, and
still confidential, report by the inspector general's office of the
Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   The report criticizes the office of the comptroller of the
currency for, among other things, a lack of independence when
examining how well banks comply with federal laws prohibiting money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The report states that the comptroller's ``examiners relied on
bank management and/or the bank's internal audit function instead
of performing their own reviews.''
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller and the Federal Reserve are the most important
bank regulators in the country. How effectively the agencies police
banks for money laundering problems has drawn heightened scrutiny
over the last few days because of a Senate investigation of private
banking practices at financial- services giant Citigroup. The
Senate begins public hearings on the matter Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Citigroup accounts being reviewed by the Senate's
Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations are those of Omar Bongo,
president of the African nation of Gabon. Millions of dollars
poured into Bongo's Citigroup accounts at a time when there were
news reports that Bongo was under investigation for possibly
accepting bribes from French oil companies.
</P>
<P>
   Examiners from the comptroller's office inquired about Bongo's
accounts in 1997, but allowed them to remain open after Citigroup
said that Bongo's riches came from a portion of Gabon's state
budget that he was legally entitled to receive. Senate
investigators said there is no such provision for Bongo in Gabon's
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``They represented to us that part of his income derived from
the government,'' said Robert Garsson, a spokesman for the
comptroller's office, referring to Citigroup's description of
Bongo's wealth. ``It was a plausible explanation. You can't fly
around the world investigating these things.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Senate investigators, the Federal Reserve described
Bongo's Citigroup account as ``troublesome'' in 1996. Citigroup has
not been charged with wrongdoing in that case, but a federal
investigation of its handling of accounts controlled by Raul
Salinas de Gortari, the brother of Mexico's former president, is
under way.
</P>

   Money laundering describes a process through which criminals
clean ``dirty'' money by ``washing'' ill-gotten gains through a
series of financial transactions that disguise the money's origin.
A federal investigation of possible money laundering by Russians
through the Bank of New York is the largest such inquiry to date.
The Bank of New York has not been charged with wrongdoing in that
case.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general said it would not comment on its
examination of the comptroller's office until a final version of
the report is drafted. The examination began in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller's office said that data from the 82 banks
reviewed for the inspector general's report are from 1996 and 1997
and that the agency has upgraded its money laundering reviews since
1997. No banks are mentioned by name in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot has happened since 1997 and our anti-money-laundering
group has done a number of new things, including identifying high
risk banks for possible money laundering problems,'' said the
comptroller's Garsson. ``Right now we feel we have a very good
program in place.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the comptroller's office emphasizes the
speed with which examinations are completed, rather than how
thorough they are. The report also says that the office rarely
seeks to have serious monetary penalties imposed on banks for
failing to comply with anti-money laundering statutes.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that the comptroller's office responded to that
observation by saying that it believes most banks are in full
compliance with anti-money laundering laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may well be the case,'' the report says, before noting
that ``incomplete examinations'' may mean that ``violations may
have existed, but simply were not detected.''

 &HT;    Record number of babies born to unwed moms
 &HT;    By Suzanne Gamboa
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Outlining some of the most striking evidence of
how the American family has changed, the U.S. Census Bureau reports
today that slightly more than half the first babies born to women
ages 15 to 29 in the early 1990s were conceived out of wedlock.
</P>
<P>
   That's a tremendous jump from the one of every six births to
that age group during 1930-34 and shows no signs of slowing as the
new century approaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society has fundamentally changed, and along with it the
American family,'' said Ronald Angel, chairman of the University of
Texas sociology department.
</P>
<P>
   The new Census report also notes that the proportion of pregnant
women who married before the child was born fell from 53 percent
for 1930-34 to about 24 percent for 1990-94, showing not only a
change in family structure but also a change in attitudes about
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The declines (in marriages) ... may also reflect the opinion
of some women that they may be better off in the long run relying
more on the support of their parents and their relatives for
financial and emotional assistance than by entering a potentially
unstable marriage undertaken solely to prevent an out-of-wedlock
birth,'' the Census report said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has happened in the past six decades that has contributed
to the changes in family. More women are working, societal
attitudes about premarital sex have relaxed, men and women are
waiting longer to get married, divorces are easier to get,
awareness about domestic abuse has risen and society has become
more accepting of single parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   What that means is that in the coming millennium, family will
have a whole different meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely think, without a doubt, the notion of family
itself is in transition,'' said Barbara Risman, editor of
Contemporary Sociology published at North Carolina State University
and author of ``Gender Vertigo: American Families in Transition.''
``There's no longer one kind of family. Families come in all shapes
and stripes.''
</P>
<P>
   Teri Gonzales, 23, is part of that transition. She was living in
San Benito when her son was conceived. She and his father moved in
together after she became pregnant, but the relationship didn't
work, and they never married. She now is raising her 4 1/2-year-old
son on her own in Austin. Nevertheless, she considers the
traditional two-parent family to be the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``My idea of a family, my goal, my dream,'' Gonzales said, ``is
to have the mom and the dad and the kids. I don't think that
concept is going to change in anybody's mind. That's the way it's
supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But she added that she considers herself and her son a family
``because we are here for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, a member of Parents Without Partners, said she
receives a lot of support from relatives. She and her son's father
also have a good relationship, and they make sure he spends time
with both parents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although efforts have been made to cut the number of
out-of-wedlock births _ and recent statistics show drops in teen
birth rates _ the number of single parents remains high. The trends
aren't likely to reverse any time soon, said Angel, the UT
sociology department chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our next century is going to have an alternative of family
forms. We are not going to stop in our tracks. Single-parent
families are a fact of life, and our federal and state programs are
going to have to deal with the reality of many different kinds of
families,'' Angel said.
</P>
<P>
   There's also been a rise in couples living together, said Kelly
Raley, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Census report, recent research estimates that
41 percent of children born out of wedlock in the 1990s were born
in co-habitating families. Raley said research still must be done
to understand the implications of such arrangements on children.
</P>
<P>
   But, she added, ``it's clear to me that marriage matters a lot
less for fertility. That really is a change in the concept of
family.''

`GREED' IS GOOD _ FOR FOX'S RATINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Greed'' found its comfort level in about 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The new Fox quiz show, with its $2 million-plus jackpot, had
barely begun last week when there was a question about the musician
Yo-Yo Ma.
</P>
<P>
   It was a multiple-choice question about which instrument he
plays. The contestant, whose name was Dwalu, guessed cello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed'' has rules. Dwalu's answer didn't count until his team
captain, Will, accepted or rejected it.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Woolery, the show's host, asked Will if he knew the answer
himself. Interesting question; $100,000 was at stake.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Will said, ``but if I get it wrong I'll kill his
mother.''
</P>
<P>
   And just then, deep in the black heart of Foxland, someone who
may even have been Rupert Murdoch himself surely leaped out of his
chair, pumped his fist and screamed, (set ital)``Yes!''(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Then he probably thought: Hmmm, I wonder if we really could get
him to kill Dwalu's mother.
</P>
<P>
   But we'll never know. The answer was right.
</P>
<P>
   So Fox has thrown its tail into the burgeoning quiz-show genre
with a marvelously conceived monstrosity on Thursday nights.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly conceived, too. Dick Clark and his minions concocted
``Greed'' for Fox in four weeks flat to cash in on TV's latest
craze.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed'' was no immediate threat to NBC's powerful roster. But
on its first night, it practically doubled Fox's Thursday
viewership.
</P>
<P>
   If Satan programmed Fox _ and the offer might well be on the
table _ the first show on the schedule would be ``Greed.''
</P>
<P>
   It gives us a team of players answering increasingly difficult
questions in an effort to ascend the ``Tower of Greed.'' The
``Tower of Greed'' goes from zero to $25,000 to $50,000 and so on,
until it tops off at $2 million plus some carry-over cash.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who probably could tell you where he's spent every dime
for the past 30 years, might as well have made his jackpot $100
million. After all, it doesn't appear anyone is going to win it.
One group of contestants got to $500,000 last Thursday and wisely
called it quits rather than risk it all on a difficult $1 million
question.
</P>
<P>
   One of the show's beauties is that from $100,000 on up, the
``teammates'' are encouraged to turn on each other.
</P>
<P>
   Woolery, the chucklehead, activates the show's ``Terminator,'' a
hopped-up battery of lights that lands on a contestant and allows
him or her to challenge a teammate _ winner take all.
</P>
<P>
   The lighting really does go a little screwy during these
``Terminator'' moments. When the players stand at their buzzers for
the showdown, the lights play across their eyes to bring out the
beadiness.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting that the biggest winner of all last week, a
``Terminator'' terror who took home $300,000 of his team's $500,000
winnings, was an Atlantic City lawyer with a five-day shadow and an
ill-fitting sport coat. He was almost licking his lips.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greed'' is brazenly, giddily, heartlessly reprehensible. It's
a show with built-in backstabbing, a show where Woolery actually
hands wads of cash to the contestants to tempt them.
</P>
<P>
   (set ital)Smell it,(end ital) he tells them. It's the smell of
fresh money. Don't you love it? Well, don't you? He does it with
all the aplomb of waving meat before the snouts of starving
animals.
</P>
<P>
   And you know what? ``Greed'' is also tense, and darkly amusing,
and riveting in a deep-down horrible way. I kept looking at the
clock and silently urging Woolery to hurry things along, to get to
more questions, more contestants, more money and still more
``Terminator'' strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It's come to this. Sitting at home, peeping noxiously, Foxiously
through the screen of my Sony and into the ``Tower of Greed.'' Help
us all.

 &HT;    Bush ducks foreign leader issue, says voters look for `trust'
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Picking up endorsements from Democrats and
nearly $600,000 in contributions, Texas Gov. George W. Bush
shrugged off questions about his knowledge of foreign policy
Monday, saying what voters really want to know is, ``can I trust
this person to be president.''
</P>
<P>
   While unable to name the leaders of four of the world's hot
spots when surprised by the questions from a Boston television
reporter last week, Bush said he gave the answer the voters wanted
when he said he didn't know, ``I just told the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Still offering only broad strokes about foreign policy, Bush
went on to say, ``The voters know I'll have a strong foreign policy
that promotes peace. The voters know that I intend to rebuild the
military power of the United States so we can keep the peace. The
voters know I intend to use our technological brainpower to bring
certainty to an uncertain world.''
</P>
<P>
   Making his third campaign trip to Florida this year, Bush
attended a lunch in Jacksonville and a dinner in Orlando. He also
visited a juvenile justice program in Jacksonville. Campaign aides
said Bush raised about $200,000 in Jacksonville and nearly $400,000
in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Five Democrats endorsed Bush during an Orlando press conference.
They included Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford, former Gov.
Wayne Mixson, Mayors James Naugle of Fort Lauderdale and Dick Greco
of Tampa and Tallahassee lobbyist Steve Uhlfelder, a member of the
Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never supported a Republican for governor before Jeb Bush,''
said Uhlfelder, who backed the late Gov. Lawton Chiles in 1994
against Bush. ``He has been an outstanding governor and a great
friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Uhlfelder said he was supporting the Texas governor for
president because ``no governor in this nation has done a better
job improving education. I believe education does not have a party
label.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said winning the endorsements is proof that his message is
working. ``We have fewer voters than the Democrats and we have to
nominate someone who can not only get support from Republicans but
who can reach across party lines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What people are looking for in this election is a ``candidate
who has a positive agenda,'' Bush said. ``Someone who can lead and
not leave people behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Sticking to his stump speech, Bush said he wants to simplify the
tax code, make it easier for the poor to move into the middle
class, remove the so-called marriage penalty and ``get rid of the
death tax'' on inheritances.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about school vouchers, he said he supports vouchers and
charter schools but the decision to start those programs should be
left to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's little brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, may have gotten himself
into a little public relations trouble while at the Jacksonville
lunch. Big brother was given a Jacksonville Jaguars football
jersey. His reaction was to grin and say he'd never be able to wear
it in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, a former part owner of the Jaguars, proclaimed them to
be the best pro football team in the nation. He may have to explain
that to the fans of the Miami Dolphins and the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers.

 &HT;    Crash costs to be told; Official denies `Daily News' behind
change
 &HT;    By Russell Carollo
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The Department of Defense is changing the way it
calculates repair costs for aircraft involved in accidents, a
decision that could raise the rate of serious accidents reported
each year by the military.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon announced the change following published stories by
The Dayton Daily News on military aviation safety. The newspaper
reported in October that the military was concealing its true
aviation safety record, partially because the cost of repairing
aircraft involved in accidents was based on a standard rate of
$16-an-hour _ several times less than what the repairs cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will do away with that paragraph in Department of Defense
instructions,'' said Lt. Col. Steve Campbell, a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Campbell said, the services will use actual repair
costs when estimating damages. The new estimates will vary, based
on the type of repairs needed and the location of the shop, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he expects the change to take effect within two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Repair costs estimates are critical in deciding which accidents
are reported to the public and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates often are based on hundreds _ even thousands _ of
hours of labor, and the $16-an-hour rate has served to keep the
rate of Class A accidents artificially low, the Daily News found.
Class A accidents _ the most serious type _ involve at least one
death, a permanent, total disability, the loss of an aircraft or at
least $1 million in damage.
</P>
<P>
   John Lewis, technical expert for the Professional Aviation
Maintenance Association, said hourly repair costs for civilian
planes range from $45 for small planes to $2,000 for commercial
airliners.
</P>
<P>
   Other military rules and practices have enabled the military to
conceal its aviation safety record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, Department of Defense guidelines were rewritten, making
it easier to withhold from official statistics incidents in which
someone falls from an aircraft and is killed, accidents involving
experimental aircraft and accidents occurring on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would call that creative reporting,'' said U.S. Rep. David
L. Hobson, R-Springfield. ``Somebody is playing games with our
sons' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said the decision to change the repair rate was
unrelated to the Daily News articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe they had been looking at doing that about a month
before your articles came out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping repair costs low was just one way the military concealed
its aviation safety record from the public.

   MONROE, Ohio _ Darryl Haun has discovered yet another
opportunity in the great American tradition of making a buck. Haun
is a machinist during the workweek, but at amusement parks he has
become an ace thrower of objects at targets, like rings around
bottles and quarters on plates. ``After you figure it out,'' he
explained, ``it's not total chance.''
</P>
<P>
   As a reward for his unerring aim, Haun wins stuffed animals that
are bigger than most 7-year-olds. Every four or five months, he
hauls his bounty off to the Traders' World flea market here. This
weekend he was selling many of the animals for $29 each, a lot less
than they would cost in a conventional store but a lot more than
they cost him.
</P>
<P>
   Traders' World, midway between Cincinnati and Dayton on
Interstate 75, has almost half a million square feet of indoor and
outdoor selling space for 1,200 vendors, who do business with more
than 20,000 shoppers pouring through every weekend. It is hardly
alone: scores of giant flea markets like it dot the country,
although most, unlike Traders' World, operate only part of the
year. Even in a robust economy, it seems, the flea market can
thrive by drawing enough bargain hunters, particularly those who
crave the opportunity to find a product not only cheap but perhaps
rare or unique.
</P>
<P>
   Traders' World, one of the largest, charges a vendor $40 a
weekend to set up a table outside and $68 for a booth inside,
prices that offer novice merchants a cheap way to enter the
marketplace with their goods. Fall weekends are its busiest time of
the year, and all available space was in use both Saturday and
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   While no one keeps comprehensive statistics on flea markets,
what evidence there is suggests that others are having at least
some of the success enjoyed by the one here. Ron Simmons, president
and general manager of the 1,800-vendor Traders Village near Dallas
and senior vice president of the National Flea Market Association,
says that when he surveyed 130 of more than 2,500 markets around
the country last summer, he found that the industry was more than
holding its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is up as a rule,'' Simmons said. ``Fifty-three
percent of the markets showed an increase in attendance and gross
income'' from the summer before. ``About 20 percent showed a
decrease, and the rest were showing the same. The decreases were
the result of road construction, competition or extreme weather
conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Traders' World is a wonder of enterprising vision, the fantasy
of a sod farmer, Jay Frick Sr., who opened it 15 years ago at the
age of 62 and has made it a major contender for the dollar of
southwestern Ohio's consumers. Starting with 3 buildings then, he
has now erected 13, which look like ribs extending from a
spine-like core building.
</P>
<P>
   Frick pipes in polkas, waltzes and golden oldies, has decorated
the interior with hundreds of rural artifacts and has strung
aphorisms from the ceilings like ``Don't spend all your money on
wine, women and song. Save some to spend foolishly.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all a little overdone to Becky Lugibihl, a visitor who said
she preferred garage sales. Ms. Lugibihl, a 43-year-old word
processor for the state of Ohio, had taken a bus tour to Traders'
World from Lima, Ohio, an hour and a half away. ``I got some
zucchini for 39 cents a pound,'' she said, 40 cents less than she
can find it at home. ``And I got two cans of Sani-Flush for $1
each. At stores they're $2 something.'' But the savings did not pay
for the $24 trip.
</P>
<P>
   For every Becky Lugibihl, though, there is a couple like Scott
Wood, 42, and his wife Margie, 29, of Erlanger, Ky., 40 minutes
away. They have seized on flea markets, where the vendors own the
business, as an alternative to malls, where the sellers are
sometimes ill-informed clerks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love thrift shopping, so I can buy more,'' Mrs. Wood said.
``Jeans. I got a pair for $1.50, and they're new.'' Wood said he
was considering a leather jacket that costs $297 here and $429 at a
mall.
</P>
<P>
   The Woods said they could find just about everything here:
appliances and antiques, new wedding gowns and used boots, jeans
and custom-embroidered sweatshirts, old compact discs and old
videotapes, birdhouses and produce, fast food and pony rides. Few
merchants carry silk purses anymore, but sows' ears are $1 each.
Dogs use them to gnaw on.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On the other side of the transaction, there are at least some
success stories. Flea-market merchandising has been a boon to Gary
Berding, strictly a wholesale liquidator until he opened a booth
here six weeks ago to try retail liquidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell shelf-pulls,'' Berding said _ that is, he buys goods
that big stores like Wal-Mart and Target cannot sell and that
manufacturers therefore pull off the stores' shelves and sell to
him. ``I'm kind of like a cemetery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Berding's hottest items this past weekend were Foster Grant
reading glasses with original price tags of $13.49. He was selling
them for $2 each or three for $5.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're averaging $2,000 a weekend,'' he said, or about four
times the receipts that Jay Frick Jr., who has taken over
management of the market from his father, estimates to be the
average for all booths.
</P>
<P>
   Business is slipping, however, among a mainstay of flea markets,
vendors of limited-edition collectibles: thematic plates with
images of Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley, Hummel figurines,
Beanie Baby dolls. Nancy and Ron Dornbusch said their hottest line
was Precious Moments, white porcelain figurines of children, every
one with dewy black eyes. New ones are $30. Discontinued models can
exceed $900.
</P>
<P>
   But ``something's going on,'' Mrs. Dornbusch said. ``Ebay,'' she
said, referring to the Internet auction service. ``I have people
coming in and saying, `I bought the same thing on the Internet.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Linda Engelhaupt speculate that in the lush economy, too
many merchants have sprung up to court the consumer, so the
competition has intensified. From a large indoor booth, the
Engelhaupts sell jackets, shirts and baseball caps that they
embroider on order on the premises.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago,'' Engelhaupt said, ``there weren't a lot of
embroidering machines. It was great. It peaked three years ago.
Everybody and his brother has a machine now.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, David and Maria Hamm sell a variety of collectibles and
knickknacks. ``Cookie jars are real hot,'' Mrs. Hamm said, as are
Christmas items. But they said shoppers were tougher than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want something real expensive,'' Hamm said, ``that
doesn't cost very much.''

YOUNGER CATHOLICS' BOND WITH CHURCH SLIPPING, STUDY SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A majority of US Roman Catholics between 20 and 39 have
a tenuous relationship with their church, attending Mass
sporadically and not getting involved with local parishes,
according to a national study to be released Tuesday at Emmanuel
College.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most critically, while younger people tend to feel
attached to Roman Catholic rites and theology, they find church
leaders deaf to their concerns, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   To many young Catholics, the institutional church looms like a
stern disciplinarian, scolding them for straying from church
teachings on such hot-button topics like divorce, abortion, and
birth control.
</P>
<P>
   Younger Catholics ``are not firmly embedded in the life of the
church,'' said Sister Mary Johnson, a sociology professor at
Emmanuel. ``In some cases, they are hanging on by a slender
thread.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's findings should serve as a ``wake-up call'' to
church leaders to provide a compelling argument to younger
Catholics about the importance of the church in their lives,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   What is at stake is the future vitality of the church in America
_ home to more than 60 million Roman Catholics _ which because of
dwindling numbers of priests and nuns, is coming to rely more and
more on lay Catholics to keep its parishes running.
</P>
<P>
   Many Catholic leaders already realize they need new campaigns to
reach younger members of the church. The Archdiocese of Boston and
four other Massachusetts and New Hampshire dioceses have launched
``Pilgrimage 2000,'' an ambitious effort to engage thousands of 14-
to- 40-year-olds in discussions about faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future belongs to our youth and if we don't do enough to
reach out and embrace them then we're shortchanging them,'' Sister
Marian Batho, Pilgrimage 2000 coordinator for the Archdiocese of
Boston, told the Globe in May.
</P>
<P>
   The study, authored by scholars at three universities, says the
Roman Catholic Church needs to become more inclusive and less
hierarchical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Second Vatican Council told us the church is `the people
of God,' not the church hierarchy,'' said Johnson, referring to the
famous conclave more than 30 years ago that was an attempt to
create a more open and modern church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be a more expansive sense of what it means to
be in the church,'' said William Dinges, a religious studies
professor at the Catholic University of America.
</P>
<P>
   During his pontificate, Pope John Paul II has made it clear the
church is not a democracy, a message that has filtered down to
dioceses worldwide, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   If the church seeks to remain relevant in a country where
Catholics coexist with people of many faiths, leaders must
explicitly accept those who do not fit the mold of the model
Catholic, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people we talked to have the conception that it's all or
nothing, and you have to be a good Catholic in every possible way.
That's not easy today,'' said Dean R. Hoge, professor of sociology
at Catholic University in Washington, D.C. ``It's important to
convey that it's not a total package where if you don't follow
everything, you're not OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on 848 phone interviews with Catholics in dioceses
nationwide who had been confirmed as adolescents, the study took
three years and cost $500,000. Of those surveyed, 90 percent still
identified as Catholic, 65 percent called themselves active
Catholics, and 70 percent said they attend Mass at least once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of these young Catholics called lay people
``just as important a part of the church as priests,'' said the
church should put more women in positions of authority and called
for open debate on divorce, remarriage and sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Similar ideas have been voiced by Catholics around the world. At
a meeting of European Catholic bishops at the Vatican two weeks
ago, several bishops argued that the church leadership is
heavy-handed in governing and outmoded in thought.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinal Carlo Maria Martini, the archbishop of Milan who is
considered by some as a possible successor to Pope John Paul II,
stunned the gathering with his diplomatic but sharp critique.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing awareness of the usefulness, ``even the
necessity, of a . . . consultation among the bishops on sexual
morality, the shortage of priests and other issues facing the
church,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a 4-year-old Austrian-based movement calling for a
``democratic'' church is gaining momentum across the world,
according to recent press reports. Called ``We Are Church,'' it
claims ties to 127 Catholic reform groups in 27 countries,
including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The next generation of Catholics will require even more
flexibility and creativity from the church, said the authors of the
study. According to their survey data, half of Catholics between
the ages of 20 and 39 are married to non-Catholics, including
Protestants, Jews or spouses who practice no religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will their kids go to CCD (religious education classes)? Will
they go to Protestant Bible school in the summer?'' Johnson asked.
``The Jewish community talks about this all the time. We've got to
talk about it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The church cannot afford to ignore such challenging questions,
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very good chance that young generations will be even
more diverse, the social factors that are at work becoming even
more complicated,'' she said.

 &HT;    New foundation to aid disabled
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For years, parents couldn't leave money to their
severely disabled adult children without jeopardizing federal
benefits that provide life's necessities.
</P>
<P>
   That's changing with the establishment of the Disability
Foundation. The new foundation allows parents to set up trust
accounts that will continue to provide money for life's ``extras''
_ recreational activities, hobbies, vacations _ after the parents
are dead, without causing the children to become ineligible for
Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've very excited about it,'' said Darrell Murphy, president
of the Dayton Foundation, the parent organization of the new
foundation. ``We think it fills a big need in the community and,
frankly, I think it'll be a national model.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 22,000 physically and mentally disabled people in the
Miami Valley who receive the income-based Medicaid and SSI benefits
are eligible to participate . The program, open to those who are
considered disabled for Social Security purposes, is made possible
by changes in Medicaid rules and state law.
</P>
<P>
   Before the changes, the disabled couldn't receive bequests
without jeopardizing their federal benefits, which are tied to a
recipient's income and assets. For example, a Medicaid recipient is
not permitted to have liquid assets _ including savings, cash,
stocks or certificates of deposit _ of more than $1,500.
</P>
<P>
   Lynne Pietz, the Dayton attorney who is executive director of
the Disability Foundation, said it works like this:
</P>
<P>
   Using the foundation's Ohio Community Pooled Trust, parents,
grandparents, legal guardians and disabled people themselves , in
anticipation of receiving a bequest, can set up a charitable gift
annuity account s designated for particular individuals. , to be
managed by the Disability Foundation . Accounts can also be
established by others, with a court order: Montgomery County
Probate Judge George Gounaris recently allowed an aunt to set up an
account.
</P>
<P>
   The donations are invested, and the disabled person receives a
fixed amount quarterly for life. , to be used for ``supplemental
needs.'' as a guaranteed obligation of the Dayton Foundation. The
fixed amount is based on the amount of money in the account and the
person's age and life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
   Families can designate a person to oversee the spending of the
money, subject to review by a foundation committee. Acceptable uses
of the money include concert tickets, cable television, vacations,
cosmetic or elective surgery, magazine subscriptions and the like.
The person can save disbursements to buy more expensive items or
services.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the disabled person's death, any unspent funds
disbursements are first used for funeral expenses, with additional
money returned to the state to underwrite the person's public
assistance benefits. Any unspent funds money that had not been
disbursed are retained by goes to the foundation, to be used for
other programs and services for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Pietz said the payout schedule is designed so the foundation is
likely to retain about 20 percent of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Such trusts were made possible by changes in Medicaid rules
starting in 1993 and a 1995 Ohio law. Cleveland has the only other
pooled trust in Ohio, Pietz said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Already the master of the rope line and televised
town meeting, President Clinton took a technological leap into the
computer age Monday night by becoming the first president to
participate in a live Internet chat.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who describes himself as old-fashioned and
technologically challenged when it comes to computers, never
touched a keyboard or a mouse. He merely sat in front of a powerful
laptop on a stage at George Washington University and responded
verbally to questions sent to him.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks scrolled word for word across thousands of computer
screens, thanks to voice recognition software. The president
appeared in a tiny box, and could be seen putting his hand to his
chin, sipping from a soda can and looking amused at the entire
extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like FDR's fireside chats and President Kennedy's live press
conferences, this first presidential town hall meeting on the
Internet taps the most modern technology for old-fashioned
communication between the American people and their president,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a real town meeting, which allows back and forth between
the president and the audience, this one had plenty of stage
managing, with questions screened by the event's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the questions were softballs on health care, gun control
and other issues that Clinton has answered many times before. He
mixed serious policy answers with chuckles at some of the e-mail
names of the questioners _ monikers like T Love and Sissy Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's participation in the virtual town hall meeting
on Excite(AT)Home was another first in the rapidly changing world
of cyberspace, which has transformed entertainment, education and
commerce and is moving rapidly into politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a sitting president to do this is not only groundbreaking
but it shows how the Internet is becoming a fundamental tool in
politics,'' said Tom Hockaday, president of Campaign Solutions, a
concern based in Alexandria, Va., that helps candidates use the Web
to enhance their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Web is already used to raise money, gather volunteers and
spread campaign themes to potential voters. Those in the field
envision a day when e-mail replaces 30-second television
advertisements and even voting takes place with the click of a
mouse and perhaps a password.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the word telegenic to describe those skilled on
television and someday we're going to have a word for a politician
who is very good on the Net,'' said Mike Cornfield, who heads an
Internet research organization called Democracy Online.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other celebrity chats, Clinton's event, limited to
50,000 participants, was modest indeed. Pop singer Britney Spears
drew a record 234,000 participants in her celebrity chat on America
Online, a competitor of Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers for Clinton's town hall were about the same as those
for past Web chats with singers Michael Jackson and Rod Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledges that he is better at talking Internet
policy than actually surfing the Net. Aides said that Clinton owns
a computer but does not use it on his desk in the Oval Office and
prefers to write notes longhand. ``He's definitely been on the
Internet,'' one aide said. ``He's sent e-mails but he basically is
from the era of the typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Clinton frequently mentions in speeches the need
to connect schools in poor neighborhoods to the Internet and
prepare for the next millennium with a technologically advanced
workforce. But Clinton has ceded technology to Vice President Al
Gore, who unlike his boss knows that spam is not a processed lunch
meat and that RAM is a computer storage device, not a horned
animal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who boasted in an interview that he helped invent the
Internet, held his first electronic town meeting in 1994 _ a
primitive event by today's standards that drew 900 people and was
held on a dinosaur of a computer, a Compaq 486. Midway through, the
transmission went haywire and ``Iba+iuXE ytoo'' appeared on Gore's
screen.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether history books will make note of
Clinton's chat, perhaps alongside Woodrow Wilson's first formal
news conference, Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats and Dwight
D. Eisenhower's media briefings over that cutting-edge technology
called television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday this will look like the first flight at Kitty Hawk _
not too impressive, pretty crude, but it was the first,'' said
Craig Crawford, editor in chief of Hotline, the Web-based political
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The event was as political and commercial as it was historic.
The idea was conceived at the Democratic Leadership Council, which
used the event to show off centrists it hoped would help fill
Clinton's shoes in the next century. Excite(AT)Home, the Internet
concern that provided the technology, saw the chat as a way to
publicize its Internet chat software.
</P>
<P>
   Participating from other sites across the country were Mayor Don
Cunningham of Bethlehem, Pa.; Mayor Ron Gonzales of San Jose,
Calif.; Assemblyman Antonio Riley of Wisconsin; Gov. Jeanne Shaheen
of New Hampshire; and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of
Maryland. Also involved in the chat were Al From, president of the
Democratic Leadership Council, who was the moderator, and Marc
Andreessen, the founder of Netscape.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Riley typed from Homeboyz Interactive, a Milwaukee company that
trains former gang members and other young people for jobs in the
computer age. He spoke about the importance of computers in helping
lift people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who at 34 is one of the country's youngest mayors,
said he uses his computer every day, sending e-mail to department
heads and responding to constituents. Still, he said he understood
why Clinton was not quite involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is in the same generation as my father, the
50-something baby boomers,'' Cunningham said in an interview.
``Some of them are into computers and some of them are not. My
father just got e-mail. But the world is changing and this event
shows that everyone has to get online, even the president.''

ADVERTISING: MEDIA SERVICES FOR INTERNET COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It often seems these days as if dot-com companies are peddling
their wares by buying up every moment of commercial time and every
inch of advertising space everywhere from matchbooks to cyberspace
to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, those purchases are usually the result of decisions
made by specialists in media planning and buying, who, despite
appearances, are trying to spend finite amounts of money as
efficiently and effectively as possible.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, one of the largest agencies devoted to media
services, Media Edge in New York, is forming a unit dedicated to
online media. The unit, Digital Edge, will focus on planning and
buying for Internet media, electronic commerce, fledgling
technologies like video on demand and the so-called convergence of
new and traditional media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that there's so much going on here that we wanted
a group to concentrate on it as well as educate the rest of us
about it,'' said Beth Gordon, president of Media Edge, which is
part of Young &AMP; Rubicam, in an interview Monday. Details about the
formation of Digital Edge are to be announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Edge joins a growing list of operations specializing in
Internet media that are being set up by bigger media services
agencies to counter the competition from the new breed of Internet
agencies like Agency.com and Modem Media.Poppe Tyson, which was
spun off from True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in January, Starcom Worldwide, the media services
unit of the Leo Group in Chicago, opened Starcom IP to handle
online media planning and buying functions. (IP is from ``Internet
protocol''; the long strings of numbers known as Internet protocol
addresses are what enables computers to seek one another out.)
</P>
<P>
   Starcom IP is already ``becoming a global brand,'' said Wally
Petersen, a spokesman for Leo.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Edge, which like Media Edge will be based in New York,
is opening with a staff of 15, handling 13 accounts with billings
estimated at $30 million. Some clients like Gifts.com _ a new Web
site jointly owned by the Reader's Digest Association and Startek
Inc. _ are being transferred from Media Edge, which has worldwide
billings estimated at more than $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Some clients like AT&AMP;T, with billings estimated at $10 million
to $15 million, and Wine.com, formerly Virtual Vineyards, are new.
AT&AMP;T had used Modem Media.Poppe Tyson in Norwalk, Conn., as its
interactive agency until July, when the Strategic Interactive Group
unit of Bronner.com in Boston was named to handle creative and
media duties in what was described as a mutual parting over
philosophical differences.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic Interactive will keep the AT&AMP;T Internet creative
assignment as the media duties shift to Digital Edge. Because Media
Edge is the agency of record for AT&AMP;T in traditional media, the
appointment of Digital Edge permits a closer integration of
interactive and mainstream campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The client roster for Digital Edge also includes Blink.com, a
bookmarking Web site; Celebrity Cruises, part of Royal Caribbean
Cruises; Ericsson, the cellular telephone company; interactive work
for Helzberg's Diamond Shops, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway, and
Webstakes.com, a Web site that links consumers to promotional
offers.
</P>
<P>
   Three executives from Media Edge are being named to run Digital
Edge, reporting to Steve Lanzano, executive vice president at Media
Edge.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the leadership is a troika, to use a term the Russian
digirati might, Ms. Gordon replied that ``because there's so much
to cover, it doesn't make sense to have a single leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Schanzer, 31, vice president and associate planning
director, will become vice president and managing director of
Digital Edge. David Adelman, 34, senior vice president and
technology director at Media Edge, will become senior vice
president and convergence media director at Digital Edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``What David will concentrate on,'' Ms. Gordon said, explaining
his title, ``is how TV and some combination of the Internet and
other media will ultimately converge.''
</P>
<P>
   And John Donnarumma, 28, vice president and associate technology
director at Media Edge, will become technology director at Digital
Edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be looking into what systems do we need to run the media
operations of the future,'' Ms. Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like something for one of the ``In the Year 2000''
segments on ``Late Night With Conan O'Brien.''

DRIVING INTO MEXICO? $800 DEPOSIT, POR FAVOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., Nov. 14) 
(jt) 
 By SAM DILLON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For American and Canadian tourists who are
dismayed over a new plan to charge deposits of up to $800 for
foreign-registered cars driven into Mexico, the government has some
advice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get used to it. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Customs officials were to begin collecting the increased
deposits on Nov. 1, but after criticism by American lawmakers,
residents of border states and some Mexican officials, the
government postponed the start-up until Dec. 1 _ when, it insists,
the daunting measures, meant to discourage illegal importation of
cars, will take effect. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under current rules, a traveler who wishes to drive a car with
American plates into Mexico at any of the 23 legal crossing points
along the 2,000-mile border can receive a six-month permit by
paying an $11 deposit by credit card. Two other, cash-based options
are far more expensive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, the deposits rise to $400 for a
foreign-registered car manufactured before 1994, to $600 for cars
made between 1994 and 1998, and to $800 for models newer than that.
The deposits are to be paid in cash or by credit card; in the
latter case, the Mexican government will not simply retain the
voucher but will immediately debit the card, officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The deposits apply only to cars that pass into the Mexican
interior, beyond a legally defined border zone that extends 25
kilometers, or about 16 miles, south of the frontier. The deposits
do not apply at all to the peninsula of Baja California, which
includes two states that have traditionally enjoyed a variety of
free-trade provisions, officials said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Highway checkpoints are set up at the perimeters of the 16-mile
zone, and a driver caught without a permit can lose his car. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new deposits will probably greatly reduce cross-border
tourism. Experts on car travel to Mexico, including owners of
agencies that sell Mexican car insurance to foreign motorists, say
that if the new deposits take effect, a large percentage of
American and Canadian tourists are likely to cancel their Mexican
plans.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be terrible,'' said Olivia Bravo, co-owner of
the Bravo Insurance Agency in Laredo, Texas Her agency sells 5,000
policies a year to motorists heading into Mexico. She predicted
that sales of Mexican policies would fall by at least half under
the new rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to kill the goose that lays the golden eggs,''
Mrs. Bravo said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 2.7 million Americans and 34,000 Canadians crossed
into Mexico beyond the border zone, and the American motorists
spent $679 million in their Mexican travels, said Camilo Perez
Venegas, a director at the Council for Tourist Promotion, a
government agency. Another statistic measuring the same
cross-border tourism is that Mexican Customs issued 750,000
six-month permits for foreign cars to circulate in Mexico in 1998. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Five congressmen, from Texas, Arizona and California, outlined
the broad discontent in border states in a meeting Nov. 3 with
Mexican Ambassador Jesus Reyes Heroles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawmakers, Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas, said his
constituents in Corpus Christi have been organizing to protest the
measure, and other demonstrations and boycotts appeared to be
brewing all along the border. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very unhappy with this, because they just don't
have the money,'' Ortiz said. ``A lot of people can't afford to
even get a credit card, much less have $600 to $800 for this.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The new deposits are designed to force people who drive cars
into Mexico to drive them out again, since at least 1.5 million
cars have been left behind _ in effect, imported illegally _ said
officials at the treasury ministry, which together with the
interior ministry wrote the new rules. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 1.5 million owners of the illegal cars are so powerful
politically that authorities simply discard the possibility that
police might seize the illegal cars or arrest the owners. Last year
federal police confiscated only 8,000 of the illegal cars. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Marco Provencio, a treasury ministry spokesman, said that the
owners of the illegal cars pay no taxes, making them a drag on
government revenues and a threat to Mexican car dealers. Pretax
prices on new cars in Mexico are on average about 5 percent higher
than in the United States, he said. When taxes are included,
Mexican prices increase by 21 percent, United States prices by
about 8 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the new deposit's impact on tourism appears to have gone
largely unconsidered in the government's internal debate. Several
tourism ministry officials expressed surprise over the new rules,
saying they had not heard of them. One asked a reporter to explain
the measures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An American official said he believed that the Oct. 28
postponement of the new plan was a first step toward canceling it
completely. But Provencio said that people should plan to comply. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not planning to repeal this,'' he said. ``We wouldn't
postpone it for a month and then cancel it. That wouldn't be a
serious way to operate.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: AFTER THE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 9:
</P>
<P>
   What began in 1961 as a crude expanse of cinder blocks and
barbed wire became in time a 113-mile stretch of fortified concrete
and steel, imprisoning West Berlin. It was both a physical and
psychic barrier, for 28 years the most powerful symbol of the Cold
War, dividing not just Berlin and Germany and Europe but East from
West. Then, 10 years ago, on the evening of Nov. 9, 1989, the
Berlin Wall came down, its collapse a dramatic expression of the
larger failure of a Soviet empire brought down by economic decay,
the cynicism of its citizens and the historic decision of its
leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, not to use the force needed to hold it
together. In fact, by allowing the wall to be breached without
military response, Gorbachev did exactly what President Reagan, on
a visit to Berlin two years before, had demanded: `` Gorbachev,
tear down this wall!''
</P>
<P>
   The day after the wall fell in 1989, what had been a trickle of
dangerous crossings became a flood of humanity seeking to exchange
the East's oppression for the democratic promise of the West.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, that exchange has yielded huge dividends for the
nations and citizens of the old empire. Freedom of thought has
replaced the deadening conformity of a single ideology. Oppressive
five-year economic plans have given way to freer markets. The
secret police and other devices of totalitarianism have largely
disappeared. But any honest stock-taking, 10 years later, must
concede that progress has been uneven.
</P>
<P>
   In Eastern Europe, for example, Poland, Hungary and the Baltic
states _ Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia _ have prospered. Romania,
Bulgaria and the components of the old Yugoslavia have fared less
well. Most observers agree that the countries that bit the bullet
first _ closing inefficient industries, reducing state subsidies _
have shown the best results. In political terms, the differences
are less pronounced. Democracy, with multiple parties and free
elections, has taken root nearly everywhere, though at varying
speeds, with the former Yugoslavia being the most glaring
exception.
</P>
<P>
   Germany itself illustrates the complexities of moving from one
system to another. The German economy is a third larger than any
other in Europe. But integrating two economic systems and two
ideologies has not been a seamless process. Headlong economic
reform, including a misguided high-wage policy, left a 20 percent
unemployment rate in the former East Germany. Even now there is a
certain nostalgia for the old days when everyone had a job, however
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   But except for unreconstructed Communists, few wish to go back.
True, there is too much crime and corruption in some of these new
societies. Even so, thoughtful Eastern Europeans have made
remarkable strides toward reclaiming their pre-Communist cultural
identities and pressing their political leaders for greater
democracy. Indeed, in country after country the tyranny enforced
behind the wall seems a rapidly receding memory.

SEATTLE PREPARING FOR POTENTIAL TERRORISM DURING WTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Local hospitals are stockpiling antidotes against
biological and chemical weapons and putting their own
decontamination units in place in preparation for the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Harborview Medical Center, like other downtown hospitals, has
warned its staff to be on the lookout for unusual clusters of
symptoms that would alert them to biological or chemical exposure
in time to intervene quickly and minimize potential damage. Most of
the hospitals will be doing dry-runs of their response plans in the
final week before the conference, which runs from Nov. 30 through
Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to emphasize the likelihood of a (weapon of mass
destruction or bioterrorism) is really quite small, and we must
keep this in perspective,'' said Dr. Ron Dobson, chief of emergency
services at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. ``But it is not
zero. The (attack on the) World Trade Center and the Oklahoma City
bombing have shown us that we are at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Public Health _ Seattle &AMP; King County, is asking physicians to
be especially aware of symptoms that might indicate an attack
involving anthrax, botulism, or smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be more acutely aware of a cluster of flu-like
symptoms,'' said Alonzo Plough, health department director.
``There's a possibility it could be related to an exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, hospitals are increasing their staffing to handle
everything from potential injuries from riots to chemical attacks,
said Dr. Michael Copass, director of Harborview's emergency
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to realize we're in a time and age when people no
longer keep their sadness at home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are tracking supplies of medications and antidotes
that would be useful to combat anthrax, smallpox, botulism, or
chemical agents, such as nerve gases, said Kim Baisch, manager of
emergency services for Virginia Mason Medical Center. The amounts
and locations of those medications will be reported to Harborview,
which would coordinate a response to such an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medications will be available to treat those things,'' she
said. ``The supplies will be here in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   One medication hospitals are keeping close track of, for
example, is atropine, a drug used to combat damage from
neurotoxins, such as Sarin, the gas used in the Tokyo subway
attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atropine is a mainline defense for many chemicals of mass
destruction,'' said Dobson. ``What we're doing is making certain
how much each hospital has and where it is if we need it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, clinicians will be looking for signs of biological
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax, for example, is caused by a spore-forming bacterium
that produces flu-like symptoms that worsen quickly.
</P>
<P>
   An epidemic of anthax in its early stages could be confused with
a wide variety of viral, bacterial or fungal infections, so
epidemiologists will be on alert to try to discern patterns that
would discriminate such an epidemic from a more mundane outbreak of
the flu, Plough said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues around planning is very rapidly trying to
determine what's happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The health department, which monitors 52 diseases on an ongoing
basis anyway, is well equipped to do the epidemiological analysis
to pick up an attack, he said. ``We do this everyday, 7 days a
week, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The incubation period for anthrax can be one to six days,
followed by gradual, non-specific symptoms that may include fever,
malaise, fatigue and coughing.
</P>
<P>
   Two to three days after that, however, the symptoms develop into
severe respiratory distress and shock and death may follow within
24 to 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a particular concern because it's difficult to treat,
Dobson said. ``It's treatable, yes. How successful is a question.''
</P>
<P>
   Botulism, which is caused by neurotoxins produced by the
bacterium Clostridium botulinum, is treatable, but often requires
putting patients on ventilators to prevent them from dying.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of botulism begin as early as 24 to 36 hours
following exposure. Patients may initially show generalized
weakness, dizziness, and drooping eyelids, followed by extreme
dryness of the mouth and nose. Motor symptoms also begin early on
and may include blurred vision, and difficulty swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent cause of death is respiratory failure caused
by paralysis of respiratory muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox is also a concern, Dobson said. Even though the disease
has been eradiacated in nature since 1978, there is a small but
real possibility that secret stores of the virus exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely, and we're unaware of any, but we can't rule it
out,'' he said. Because the disease has been eradicated, a
percentage of the population has never been immunized against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be fatal, but it is treatable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with some of the biological agents are the lag times
before symptoms appear, Plough said. Smallpox, for example, can
take days or weeks to show up.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to biological agents, hospitals are taking steps to
prepare for chemical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Washington Medical Center, for example, is
increasing its nursing staff and number of doctors on-call by about
20 percent, said Shirley Tainter, nurse manager of the UW's
emergency department.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish is also increasing staff by about 20 percent for the
week of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a fair amount of effort to design facilities and
pre-establish some decon (decontamination) stuff in the area,''
said Copass. ``We want to emphasize, we're always in a state of
readiness for things that don't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has taken steps to establish decontamination centers at
various undisclosed locations, he said. ``The equipment is in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Area hospitals are preparing and upgrading their decontamination
facilities to make them independent of the fire department in the
event of a massive event.
</P>
<P>
   If such an event occurs, ``the reality is, we won't be able to
call 911 (for help with decontamination),'' said Marianne Klaas,
accreditation and safety manager for Swedish Medical Center. So the
hospital, like others in the area, is investing in its own
decontamination equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to shut down the hospital, filter people
through a central intake where we can shower and wash them down,''
she said. The hospital has purchased $50,000 worth of tents,
special respirators, protective suits, boots and gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emphasis on biological and chemical attacks,
however, the biggest concern remains physical injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bioterrorism is a concern, but the greater likelihood of
disaster has to do with riots or injury resulting from protests,''
Dobson said. ``Our hope is it will be business as usual and there
will be large and peaceful demonstrations and no one gets hurt.''

   Classes in Cuba
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a Spanish teacher and would like to get information
about travel to Cuba for language courses. _ Jim Rodgers,
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   A. You may see a few Cuban cigars and baseball pitchers around,
but the 1963 embargo on trade and travel with Cuba is still in
effect. So, travel by Americans to Cuba is limited and can be
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there has been an increase in travel to the island by
Americans in recent years. Some Americans circumvent the law by
using foreign travel sources, but the regulations allow trips to
Cuba for certain reasons, including education.
</P>
<P>
   According to Maria Ibanez, a spokeswoman for the Treasury
Department, ``it's not that complicated'' for a teacher to gain a
license to visit Cuba to take courses there. Essentially, you would
have to write a letter to the Office of Foreign Assets Control,
Department of the Treasury, Washington, D.C. 20220, confirming your
position and stating the purpose of your visit. First, Ms. Ibanez
suggested, check out the office's Web site, www.treas.gov/ofac, or
call (202) 622-2520 for details. A summary of the policy is also at
a new today State Department site,
www.state.gov/www/regions/wha/cuba/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   There are also organized educational trips. The group Global
Exchange has been leading trips to Cuba for about 10 years, said
Roberto Leni, who runs its Cuban program. The trips, which leave
from Cancun, Mexico, include two and four-week language courses at
the University of Havana.
</P>
<P>
   These trips are licensed as ``fully hosted'' by a Cuban
organization, Leni said, adding, ``We've never had a participant
fined or jailed'' (fully hosted trips require that no American's
money go to any Cuban entity; so, for example, a non-Cuban airline
must be used). The students take classes four hours a day and take
part in other activities tailored to the interests of the group _
from bicycle outings to meetings with human rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   The cost for two weeks is $1,200, and $1,750 for a month. This
includes round-trip air fare from Cancun, double or triple
accommodations in a guest house (hotels cost extra) and two meals a
day. Contact Global Exchange at 2017 Mission St., No. 303, San
Francisco, Calif. 94110; (415) 255-7296, fax (415) 255-7498, or
www.globalexchange.org.
</P>
<P>
   It is wise to ask any American organization running a trip to
Cuba whether it has a license from the foreign assets office and
whether you can see the license. Also ask whether the air carrier
is licensed.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, which has formal relations with Cuba, the Bureau de
Tourisme de Cuba, 440 Boulevard Rene Levesque, Montreal, Quebec H2Z
1U7, (514) 875-8004, says education trips are offered by Unique
Tours, 666 Rue Sherbrooke Ouest, Montreal, Canada H3A 1E7, (514)
844-2831, fax (514) 844-2018, www.vuvoyage.com; and Voyages
Culturels Cuba, 5059 St.-Denis Street, Montreal, Canada H2J 2L9,
(888) 691-0101, fax (514) 982-2438, www.culturecuba.com.

   Getting to Slovenia
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am going to Kobarid, Slovenia, for a World War I
commemoration. I have booked a flight to Venice. How can I get from
there to Kobarid by public transportation? _ Guy Cavallaro,
Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. Kobarid is known to many as Caporetto, which in World War I
was part of Italy and at the center of the fighting chronicled by
Hemingway in ``A Farewell to Arms.'' The Kobarid Museum documents
the battle in great detail.
</P>
<P>
   The town lies below Mount Krn (7,362 feet) in the Soca Valley,
an Alpine resort area. It is only a few miles from the Italian
border, but getting there is not easy, according to Darja Gacnik,
director of the Slovenian Tourist Board in New York, and Branko
Moric, who handles Central Europe for Central Holidays of Englewood
Cliffs, N.J. They said your best bet may be to rent a car.
</P>
<P>
   You can also take the daily 7:04 a.m. train from Venice to
Ljubljana, the capital, in the center of the country (a five-hour
trip costing about $29 in second class, at 1,800 lire to the
dollar), then take a bus or train back west to Kobarid.
</P>
<P>
   But you can avoid that. From the Venice airport, take a bus to
Mestre and get off at the train station. Trains to Gorizia, on the
Italian-Slovenian border, leave every hour or two at 53 minutes
past the hour (most also leave from Venice Santa Lucia 20 minutes
earlier). It is about a two-hour trip and costs $8.
</P>
<P>
   Once in Gorizia, you will have to take a cab (about $15) or two
buses (switching at the border) into adjoining Nova Gorica,
Slovenia. Kobarid is about a 30-mile drive north, so you could take
a cab, for about $55. But there are direct buses from Nova Gorica
to Kobarid at 9:40 a.m. and 3:35 p.m for about $5. For details,
call the bus depot at Nova Gorica, (386) 65-21-447.
</P>
<P>
   Another option involves staying overnight in Udine: a bus runs
from there to Kobarid at 9 a.m. on Monday and Wednesday only, for
about $4.50. Information: (39-0432) 608-111.
</P>
<P>
   The Slovenian Tourist Board is at 345 East 12th St., New York,
N.Y. 10003; (212) 358-9686, fax (212) 358-9025. Ms. Gancik also
runs an agency, Slovenia Travel, (212) 358-9024, fax (212)
358-9025. Central Holidays is at 120 Sylvan Ave., Englewood Cliffs,
N.J. 07632; (800) 935-5000, fax (201) 228-5327. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Christmas Dinner in Paris
</P>
<P>
   Q. I will be in Paris with my children for Christmas. Will any
restaurants or cafes and tourist attractions be open on Christmas
Day? _ E.M., Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   A. Most attractions and restaurants in Paris will be closed on
Christmas Day. But you should be able to find a good meal. In
general, the best areas to find one are Montparnasse and the
Champs-Elysees.
</P>
<P>
   Both La Coupole, 102 Boulevard de Montparnasse, (33-1)
43.20.14.20, with a bustling grand room out of the 1930's, and Au
Pied de Cochon, 6 Rue Coquilliere, (33-1) 40.13.77.00, near Les
Halles, say they will be open. Near the Opera, Le Grand Cafe
Capucines, 4 Boulevard des Capucines, (33-1) 3.12.19.00, has a
Belle Epoque interior. A bit pricier than those is Fouquet's, 99
Avenue des Champs-Elysees, (33-1) 47.23.70.60.
</P>
<P>
   As far as major attractions go, the Eiffel Tower will be open
from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. The children might enjoy the Grande
Gallerie de l'Evolution in the natural history museum in the Jardin
des Plantes. It includes a zoo and is open 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on
Christmas; (33-1) 40.79.30.00.
</P>
<P>

JUDGE SAYS YUGOSLAVIA IMPEDES WORK OF WAR CRIMES TRIBUNAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The president of the tribunal examining war
crimes in the Balkan states that were once part of a larger
Yugoslavia told the General Assembly Monday that the Yugoslav
government has continued to obstruct the court's work and suggested
that the Security Council lacks the will to force it to comply.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, Gabrielle Kirk McDonald, said that the majority of
suspected war criminals indicted by the tribunal are walking about
free in Serbia, the major republic remaining in Yugoslavia, and in
the Serbian enclave in the now-independent Bosnia, which is
patrolled by French troops in the NATO peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the General Assembly, McDonald said, ``It is
simply unacceptable that territories have become safe havens for
individuals indicted for the most serious offenses against
humanity. It must be made absolutely clear to such states that this
illegal and immoral behavior will not be tolerated.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, whose six-year term on the tribunal ends next week,
spoke even more bluntly to reporters after her speech. She said the
French force in the Bosnian Serb enclave must arrest the
territory's wartime leader, Radovan Karadzic, and military chief,
Ratko Mladic. Both have been indicted for war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does it take?'' McDonald asked at a news briefing. ``It
takes action.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said she had addressed the Security Council twice and
written four letters about Yugoslavia's lack of willingness to
help. The council, she said, has a range of sanctions at its
disposal to force cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But first you have to have the will, the political will to do
something about it,'' she said to the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, the tribunal indicted Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic, and four senior aides, charging them with crimes against
humanity _ including murder, deportation and prosecutions _ in the
Serbian province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said that Milosevic's government posed one of the
tribunal's biggest problems. ``It's noncompliance and it's now
reached the level of absolute obstructionism,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She referred several times to the tribunal's indictment four
years ago of three Yugoslav army officers charged with killing 260
men in the Croatian town of Vukovar on Nov. 19, 1991. Yugoslav
authorities have yet to hand over the accused Serbs _ Mile Mrksic,
Veselin Sljivancanin and Miroslav Radic _ and have said the
tribunal should make its files available to them so the Yugoslavs
could conduct their own inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald also said that Croatia has refused to transfer Mladen
Naletilic, a Croat indicted for war crimes, to the tribunal's
custody. Naletilic is ill, the Croatian mission to the United
Nations said, and will be handed over when his health improves.
</P>
<P>
   The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia,
as the court is formally known, was established by a Security
Council resolution on May 25, 1993. Its mandate is to prosecute
people responsible for serious violations of international
humanitarian law in the countries that were part of Yugoslavia
before communism fell. So far, 91 people have been indicted. Six of
them have died, and charges have been dropped for 18. McDonald said
that only 10 suspects have been tried.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, a former federal judge, said that the tribunal's
resources are limited and that it cannot try everyone connected
with the atrocities.

ACQUISITION OF TWO BANKS TO PROCEED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A prolonged delay in HSBC Holdings' $9.9 billion
acquisition of Republic New York Corp. and Safra Republic Holdings
ended Monday after Edmond Safra, who founded both banks, agreed to
accept $450 million less for his stakes.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC had delayed completion of the acquisitions pending the
outcome of an investigation by Japanese regulators into Republic's
securities unit. The inquiry was started at the beginning of
September.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the United States and Japan say William Rogers,
who was president of the futures unit of Republic New York
Securities, aided his client, Martin Armstrong, founder and
chairman of Princeton Economics International Ltd. and its Hong
Kong brokerage subsidiary Cresvale International Ltd., in
defrauding investors of more than $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is far from over, but HSBC's internal
investigation has concluded that its liability for possible damages
is manageable enough to proceed with the deal. Safra has also
agreed to be personally responsible for up to an additional $180
million in liability costs related to the investigation beyond an
already agreed and undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am taking this action because I believe that a swift
completion of the transaction will be to the benefit of Republic's
clients, shareholders and employees to whom my life's work has been
devoted,'' Safra said.
</P>
<P>
   While Safra will get about $57.41 a share for his stake in the
two banks, Republic shareholders will still get $72 a share, under
terms of HSBC's original offer in May. Under the new agreement,
Safra, who was supposed to get a payout of $2.75 billion, will now
get $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Sir John Bond, group chairman of HSBC, said of Monday's
arrangement with Safra: ``I am pleased that after a period of
uncertainty, we have found a way forward.'' He added: ``We have the
greatest admiration for Edmond Safra taking personal action which
embodies the spirit and integrity of Edmond and the franchise he
has built.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised the agreement, which will allow HSBC to
increase its retail banking and private banking presence in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an elegant way to do it,'' said Richard Coleman, an
analyst at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. in London. It obviously allowed HSBC
to lower the price without getting into murky water by lowering the
price for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Shares of HSBC rose 7.5 pence, or about 1 percent, to 763 pence
or $12.36 in London, while shares of Republic rose $4.4375, or 6.7
percent, to $70.625 on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   While investors and analysts seemed pleased that the acquisition
would move forward, some analysts were still uneasy about the
possible liabilities related to the fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal with Safra is some indication of the level of
losses,'' said James Johnson, an analyst for Credit Lyonnais in
London. ``I don't think the case is resolved at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Others dismissed the potential liabilities as simply a
distraction. ``All along, the financial issue has not been the
question,'' Coleman said. ``It was really whether the bank's
reputation had been damaged.'' Nonetheless, he said, ``I suspect
HSBC negotiated pretty hard.''

EDITORIAL: YES, THE REGENTS MEAN BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 9:
</P>
<P>
   New York's education commissioner, Richard C. Mills,
crisscrossed the state for three years urging school districts to
upgrade their curriculums to meet the challenging new standards and
tests that the state Board of Regents began to phase in this year.
But new statewide test scores show that even some suburban school
districts turned in disappointing scores and may have failed to
beef up course offerings.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tests _ keyed to the new Regents' standards _ have
revealed mediocrity at many levels, sending a shock through
affluent small towns and suburbs that are accustomed to looking
good in statewide comparisons. Only 67 percent of the fourth
graders statewide met the new math standard. The news was more
dismal for eighth graders, where only 38 percent performed at grade
level. The performance drop between fourth and eighth grades
reflects a statewide problem with middle schools, which have
consistently failed to incorporate challenging new material into
their courses.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, the big-city systems lagged behind the suburbs.
New York City placed ahead of the four other large urban systems,
with 23 percent of its eighth graders meeting the math standard,
compared with 22 percent in Buffalo, 19 percent in Syracuse, 10
percent in Rochester and 13 percent in Yonkers. But some suburban
systems also performed in the mediocre range. In Suffolk County's
East Hampton district, for example, only 41 percent of eighth
graders met the standard. A fifth of the children in exclusive
suburbs like Rye, Mamaroneck and Great Neck failed to meet the
eighth-grade math standard.
</P>
<P>
   When Mills visited high-performing schools, he typically found
the new standards prominently displayed in teachers' lounges and
classrooms and encountered principals who could discuss the
standards issue fluently. In failing schools, the principals and
teachers had gone on teaching the watered-down curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and political leaders have a right to be angry about
dismal test performance. But they need to direct their anger at
school officials who took the new standards lightly when they
should have been retooling to meet them.

SENATOR DELAYS VOTE TO CONFIRM ADMIRAL AS ENVOY TO CHINA
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: N.H., Calif.)  (nk) 
 By ELIZABETH BECKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican senator has blocked the confirmation
of Adm. Joseph W. Prueher to be the next ambassador to China,
saying he is worried that the admiral is too friendly to China.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert C. Smith, R-N.H., last Thursday put a hold on a full
Senate vote on the admiral's nomination until the Pentagon releases
official documents detailing his relations with China and Taiwan
when he commanded the combined American forces in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried that he's been lax on planning for the defense of
Taiwan,'' said Smith. ``Number two, he's a bit naive on China at
best, or at worst somewhat dangerous to the nation's national
security.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Smith and
Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla., asked for documents including those
detailing the admiral's plans for defending Taiwan, his objections
to arms sales requests by Taiwan and whether he received permission
to allow Chinese officers to tour an American nuclear attack
submarine in California.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate Foreign Relations committee voted to
confirm the admiral. But with Congress attempting to complete
business this week and go into recess as early as Wednesday
evening, Smith's hold could delay a vote by the full Senate and
mean the death of the admiral's nomination. In that case, the
president's only recourse would be to make Prueher an ambassador
through a recess appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president believes this nomination should be acted on
expeditiously _ it's clear there is bipartisan support for the
admiral,'' said David C. Leavy, the spokesman for the National
Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department plans to deliver the documents to Smith
on Tuesday, a Pentagon spokesman said. Smith said that if he is not
satisfied with those documents he may refuse to allow a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The post in Beijing has been empty since July following the
departure of the former ambassador, James Sasser.

EDITORIAL: A MINIMUM WAGE BILL FOR THE WELL OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 9:
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will vote today on a Republican-sponsored amendment
to raise the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour, over three
years. Though the Democrats propose the same hike spread over only
two years, the basic proposal is uncontroversial. Both parties
recognize the popularity and wisdom of raising wages of low-paid
workers when unemployment rates are at their lowest levels in 30
years and workers, therefore, face no threat of mass layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, the Republicans are not content to do this good deed and
go home. They have loaded the amendment with tax cuts that are
fiscally damaging and cynically focused on wealthy workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican package would cost about $75 billion over 10
years. Pointing to a $1 trillion surplus outside Social Security,
the Republicans say their tax cuts are affordable. But that
expected surplus assumes that Congress will live with current
budget caps and cut domestic discretionary spending _ every program
other than the military and entitlements like Medicare _ by at
least 10 percent after accounting for inflation. Passing a $75
billion tax cut would force further cuts in programs that will soon
be squeezed anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the Republican tax cuts go to the wealthy. The
proposal would, for example, raise the amount of salary on which
pension contributions may be made to $200,000 from $160,000. Worse
still, Peter Orszag, an economist at the University of California
at Berkeley, points out that the Republicans have structured their
plan in a way that could encourage companies to reduce
contributions they make to the pensions of low-paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan would also provide a new tax deduction for
health care premiums paid by workers whose employers cover no more
than half the cost. The tax deduction would be most valuable to
high-wage workers and would do little to make health coverage
affordable for the vast majority of the 40 million Americans who
are uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Tax Justice, a liberal research group, estimates
that the highest-earning 1 percent of taxpayers would get almost 20
percent of the proposal's tax cuts, averaging about $1,600 a year.
But the lowest-earning 20 percent would get only about 3 percent of
the tax cut, averaging about $13 a year. That feature alone makes
it a plan that President Clinton should veto. Next year,
politicians preparing for election will almost certainly send him a
bill to raise the minimum wage _ without attaching pernicious tax
cuts.

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After a long Saturday-night telephone call with
President Jiang Zemin of China, President Clinton sent his trade
representative and his top economic adviser to Beijing on Monday in
an effort to close a deal that would bring China into the World
Trade Organization in return for a wide-ranging opening of its
markets to American-made goods.
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which Clinton dispatched Trade Representative
Charlene Barshefsky and Gene Sperling, who heads the National
Economic Council _ and who was among those who advised Clinton to
walk away from a huge trade deal with China in April _ suggested
that the administration now believes that an agreement may be
within reach.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it would mark one of the most important accords with
China since the resumption of diplomatic relations with the country
two decades ago. It would also give Clinton a long-sought foreign
policy accomplishment: a claim to have helped integrate the world's
most populous nation into the global economy, putting it under the
rule of international law with an accord that could also spur
China's faltering economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the White House would not publicly discuss Clinton's
conversation with Jiang, and on Sunday White House officials even
denied it had taken place. Clinton has insisted on a veil of
secrecy around the delicate negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But one official close to the negotiations, insisting on
anonymity, said that Clinton and other top officials had a hard
time evaluating Jiang's intentions during the conversation on
Saturday. While the Chinese leader agreed to receive Clinton's
delegation, it was unclear whether he was ready to overcome the
political opposition in China to opening the country's markets _
including allowing American firms to invest heavily in
telecommunications, finance and other Chinese industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things didn't sound as positive as we would like,'' the
official said. ``It was kind of right down the middle and so we
decided that there was very little to lose in trying'' to go and
strike the deal. Another official said ``there seemed to have been
enough there to make it worth the effort. But the fact is they
don't know exactly what they are headed into.''
</P>
<P>
   In a previous call with Jiang, on Oct. 16, Clinton offered to
put together a ``bottom line'' offer _ a description of what China
must do in order to get into the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably that includes resolving existing disagreements on
telecommunications, financial services, textiles and Washington's
rights to unilaterally impose sanctions if it believes that China
is dumping its exports in the United States. The last point is a
critical one for Vice President Al Gore, who has been under
tremendous pressure from American labor unions _ which have opposed
a WTO deal with China _ not to give up the right to slap punitive
tariffs on low-cost Chinese steel, textiles and other products.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's team does not have much time to reach the enormously
complex agreement _ which would entail hundreds of pages of trade
concessions by China _ before the world's trade ministers gather in
Seattle at the end of this month. That meeting gives Clinton some
negotiating leverage, because if it is clear that China is about to
enter the WTO, Beijing will be able to play a role in setting the
agenda for the next global round of trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton is under pressure, too. The World Trade
Organization's legitimacy is vastly reduced if one of the world's
biggest trading nations is not included.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is clearly sensitive about the criticism that he missed
a huge diplomatic moment with China last April, when Prime Minister
Zhu Rongji arrived in Washington with an offer to open China's
markets that impressed American business executives with its
breadth and depth. Clinton's own advisers have said he was focused
on other things at the time _ notably the war over Kosovo _ and
feared that Congress would reject China's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The president commented on that decision for the first time last
week. ``A lot of people have said we had an agreement in April and
that we walked away from it because there was opposition from the
American labor movement,'' he said. ``I've read that a hundred
times. That is absolutely not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday Clinton said little about his weekend decision to send
Ms. Barshefsky, accompanied by Sperling, who would ordinarily have
spent the week in last-minute budget negotiations with Congress.
Asked to rate the chances of striking a deal, the president said,
``I don't know but I hope so. Ambassador Barshefsky and Mr.
Sperling have gone over there to work on it and we're doing our
best.''
</P>
<P>
   Sending along Sperling may send two different political messages
simultaneously, one to the Chinese and another to labor and other
opponents of the deal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials clearly feel mistreated by the White House's
handling of Zhu's visit, and they know that Sperling, along with
Robert E. Rubin, who was then Treasury secretary, thought the deal
could not be sold to Congress. His appearance alongside Ms.
Barshefsky _ who had urged Clinton to accept the deal with China,
with some amendments _ is a sign that she and the White House are
now on the same wavelength.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Sperling is more attuned to the mood of
Congress and labor. ``The thinking is that Gene's more inclined to
protect Clinton and Gore politically,'' one of his associates said
Monday.

   NEW YORK _ Joseph Chebet was so relieved after winning the New
York City Marathon on Sunday that he slept soundly that night.
Adriana Fernandez was so hyped up after winning the women's title
that she could not sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Sleepy or not, Chebet, a 29-year-old Kenyan, and Fernandez, a
28-year-old Mexican, needed all their energy Monday for another
tour of the city. This one truly deserved the name marathon, for it
never seemed to end. The schedule:
</P>
<P>
   --6:45 a.m. _ Appearance on Channel 4's ``Today in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   --7:15 a.m. _ Appearance on CBS's ``The Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   --7:45 a.m. _ Visit the Chase Manhattan Bank headquarters on
Park Avenue, where the race results were posted, followed by a
meeting between bankers and the two nouveau riche marathoners,
whose prize money, time bonuses and appearance fees totaled
$105,000 for Chebet and $100,000 for Fernandez.
</P>
<P>
   --8:15 a.m. _ Appearance on Channel 5's ``Good Day New York.''
</P>
<P>
   --9:30 a.m. _ Sound the starting bell at the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   --10:30 a.m. _ News conference at Tavern on the Green.
</P>
<P>
   --12:30 p.m. _ Visit the Mazda dealer who gave a new $25,000
Miata to each winner.
</P>
<P>
   --2 p.m. _ Trip to City Hall to receive the keys to the city
from Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   --4:45 p.m. _ Tape CBS's ``Late Night With David Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Chebet returns home to spend time with his family. Then
he will go to the spartan camp at 10,000-foot altitude that serves
as a training base for 15 or 20 Kenyan marathon runners. ``There is
no telephone, no electricity, no water,'' he said. ``We have to go
down to the river to get water. Everything we must do by
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez had planned to return home Monday, but her trip was
delayed for a day because the Mexican Consulate here is giving a
party in her honor Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Her victory was the first by a Mexican woman in a major
international marathon and has created a commotion in the
Spanish-language news media. Univision, which reaches all of Latin
America, did a television special hours after the race. The New
York daily newspaper El Diario carried a huge front-page photo of
Fernandez crossing the finish line and big black type that read
``Viva Mexico!''
</P>
<P>
   Race officials want both winners back next year, but based on
their words Monday, Chebet appears doubtful and Fernandez
questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Chebet plans to run next April in Boston, a marathon he also won
this year. He also expects to run a late-year marathon; he hopes
that it is in the Sydney Olympics. Chebet's agent, Federico Rosa of
Italy, who is the son of his coach, Dr. Gabriele Rosa, said running
in the Olympics and then, five weeks later, in New York was an
impossible double for Chebet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he does not run in the Olympics,'' Rosa said, ``I still
don't know about New York. He wants the world record, and New York
is not the fastest course for that. We have plenty of time to
decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said she would probably run one marathon before the
Olympics. As for an Olympic-New York double, she said, ``My coach
will decide.''
</P>
<P>
   Her coach is Rodolfo Gomez, the runner-up to Alberto Salazar in
the 1982 New York City Marathon. Fernandez trains at 12,000 feet in
mountains near Mexico City. She also runs on the track and this
year won the 1,500 meters in the Mexican championships and the
5,000 meters in the Pan American Games. Gomez said she could easily
run New York after the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ran Tokyo and Rotterdam in six weeks and was 2:09 in both,''
Gomez said. ``She's a very young marathon runner. She's run only
eight marathons in her life. She's very strong. A double is very
possible because she doesn't run many races in a year. We will
decide after the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said she believed that her victory would encourage
Mexican women to run. Gomez said he hoped that would happen. ``When
Mexican women runners get married,'' he said, ``they stop running,
stay at home, have a baby and we don't see them anymore. Maybe this
will change that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FINISHING KICKS
</P>
<P>
   Allan Steinfield, the marathon director, said the race had
32,503 starters and had 31,807 finishers, both records. He said the
10,000th runner finished in 3 hours 59 minutes 53 seconds, the
20,000th in 4:38:56 and the 30,000th in 5:56:13.
</P>
<P>
   Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, ran under the name
of Martin Fischer and finished in 3:56:13. Steinfeld said he did
not know how fast or even whether Joerg Haider, who heads Austria's
right-wing Freedom Party, finished. For security reasons, Steinfeld
said, Haider was given another race number under an assumed name.
But Steinfeld said he thought that Haider ran without the computer
chip that was issued to all runners to record their times. ``He was
unrecorded at any of the check points,'' Steinfeld said. ``He said
he finished. We have no record of him running.''

 &HT;    Doctors rule, insurer decides
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Physicians groups in Georgia and elsewhere are
applauding a move by the nation's second-largest health insurer to
let doctors have the final say on treatment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth Group's new policy, announced Monday, could put
pressure on the managed care industry to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   It is a startling departure from a long-held practice of
cost-cutting in managed care plans. The decision coincides with
patient protection legislation in Congress that focuses on denial
of treatment by managed care plans such as HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   UnitedHealth, based in Minnesota, covers about 14.5 million
Americans, including about 400,000 in Georgia. The insurer is
second in enrollment size to Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   United said it costs the company more to review doctors'
decisions than it would to cover those treatments in question.
About 99 percent of doctors' decisions are upheld by United, said
Jay Silverstein, chief marketing officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were spending $100 million a year to anger physicians, to
anger consumers and impact just 1 percent of our claims,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   United began testing the policy in Tennessee two years ago and
brought it to six other markets, Silverstein said. The policy will
roll out nationwide this month. Doctors' decisions will be reviewed
by United after treatment is delivered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   HMO managers' ability to overrule doctors' decisions about what
procedures and services are medically necessary _ and thus covered
_ has been a basic tenet of managed care. Such practices have
helped HMOs control health care costs during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   United said its policy is not a response to the so-called
Patients' Bill of Rights proposed in Congress. Still, U.S. Rep.
Charlie Norwood (R-Ga.), a leading sponsor of such legislation,
said of the United policy, ``The best care, in the long run, is
less expensive than cutting corners. ... Giving the right care
upfront is always cheaper than paying to correct the problems
created by inadequate care.''
</P>
<P>
   Other managed care plans ``will take a wait-and-see attitude''
and judge its savings impact, said Gay Ann Williams of the Georgia
Association of HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Many HMOs will be pressured to follow United's lead, said Ken
Thorpe, an Emory University health policy expert.
</P>
<P>
   He said the policy would reduce United's exposure to liability
provisions being considered in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Medical Association of Georgia, which represents about 8,000
physicians statewide, called United's decision ``a monumental
event.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The medical necessity of treatment should be determined by a
physician,'' said Bill Clark, an attorney for the doctors group.
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, that United could end up jettisoning doctors
who approve treatments the company doesn't want to cover.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Already the master of the rope line and televised
town meeting, President Clinton took a technological leap into the
computer age Monday night by becoming the first president to
participate in a live Internet chat.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who describes himself as old-fashioned and
technologically challenged when it comes to computers, never
touched a keyboard or a mouse. He merely sat in front of a powerful
laptop on a stage at George Washington University and responded
verbally to questions sent to him.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks scrolled word for word across thousands of computer
screens, thanks to voice recognition software. The president
appeared in a tiny box, and could be seen putting his hand to his
chin, sipping from a soda can and looking amused at the entire
extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like FDR's fireside chats and President Kennedy's live press
conferences, this first presidential town hall meeting on the
Internet taps the most modern technology for old-fashioned
communication between the American people and their president,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a real town meeting, which allows back and forth between
the president and the audience, this one had plenty of stage
managing, with questions screened by the event's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the questions were softballs on health care, gun control
and other issues that Clinton has answered many times before. He
mixed serious policy answers with chuckles at some of the e-mail
names of the questioners _ monikers like T Love and Sissy Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton's participation in the virtual town hall meeting
on Excite(AT)Home was another first in the rapidly changing world
of cyberspace, which has transformed entertainment, education and
commerce and is moving rapidly into politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a sitting president to do this is not only groundbreaking
but it shows how the Internet is becoming a fundamental tool in
politics,'' said Tom Hockaday, president of Campaign Solutions, a
concern based in Alexandria, Va., that helps candidates use the Web
to enhance their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Web is already used to raise money, gather volunteers and
spread campaign themes to potential voters. Those in the field
envision a day when e-mail replaces 30-second television
advertisements and even voting takes place with the click of a
mouse and perhaps a password.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the word telegenic to describe those skilled on
television and someday we're going to have a word for a politician
who is very good on the Net,'' said Mike Cornfield, who heads an
Internet research organization called Democracy Online.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other celebrity chats, Clinton's event, limited to
50,000 participants, was modest indeed. Pop singer Britney Spears
drew a record 234,000 participants in her celebrity chat on America
Online, a competitor of Excite(AT)Home.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers for Clinton's town hall were about the same as those
for past Web chats with singers Michael Jackson and Rod Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledges that he is better at talking Internet
policy than actually surfing the Net. Aides said that Clinton owns
a computer but does not use it on his desk in the Oval Office and
prefers to write notes longhand. ``He's definitely been on the
Internet,'' one aide said. ``He's sent e-mails but he basically is
from the era of the typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Clinton frequently mentions in speeches the need
to connect schools in poor neighborhoods to the Internet and
prepare for the next millennium with a technologically advanced
workforce. But Clinton has ceded technology to Vice President Al
Gore, who unlike his boss knows that spam is not a processed lunch
meat and that RAM is a computer storage device, not a horned
animal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who boasted in an interview that he helped invent the
Internet, held his first electronic town meeting in 1994 _ a
primitive event by today's standards that drew 900 people and was
held on a dinosaur of a computer, a Compaq 486. Midway through, the
transmission went haywire and ``Iba+iuXE ytoo'' appeared on Gore's
screen.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether history books will make note of
Clinton's chat, perhaps alongside Woodrow Wilson's first formal
news conference, Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats and Dwight
D. Eisenhower's media briefings over that cutting-edge technology
called television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday this will look like the first flight at Kitty Hawk _
not too impressive, pretty crude, but it was the first,'' said
Craig Crawford, editor in chief of Hotline, the Web-based political
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The event was as political and commercial as it was historic.
The idea was conceived at the Democratic Leadership Council, which
used the event to show off centrists it hoped would help fill
Clinton's shoes in the next century. Excite(AT)Home, the Internet
concern that provided the technology, saw the chat as a way to
publicize its Internet chat software.
</P>
<P>
   Participating from other sites across the country were Mayor Don
Cunningham of Bethlehem, Pa.; Mayor Ron Gonzales of San Jose,
Calif.; Assemblyman Antonio Riley of Wisconsin; Gov. Jeanne Shaheen
of New Hampshire; and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of
Maryland. Also involved in the chat were Al From, president of the
Democratic Leadership Council, who was the moderator, and Marc
Andreessen, the founder of Netscape.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Riley typed from Homeboyz Interactive, a Milwaukee company that
trains former gang members and other young people for jobs in the
computer age. He spoke about the importance of computers in helping
lift people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who at 34 is one of the country's youngest mayors,
said he uses his computer every day, sending e-mail to department
heads and responding to constituents. Still, he said he understood
why Clinton was not quite involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is in the same generation as my father, the
50-something baby boomers,'' Cunningham said in an interview.
``Some of them are into computers and some of them are not. My
father just got e-mail. But the world is changing and this event
shows that everyone has to get online, even the president.''

 &HT;    For Streeter, many big returns
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects Tech's ranking to 13th from 14th.)
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A month ago, the odds of Clemson quarterback Brandon
Streeter playing another college football game were about as long
as the Tigers' prospects of earning a bowl invitation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Streeter, who broke his collarbone during a game against
North Carolina Oct. 2, returned to the lineup last week and helped
lead Clemson to a 58-7 win.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers finally had fully grasped the nuances of the
wide-open attack implemented by coach Tommy Bowden and offensive
coordinator Rich Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good system, `` Streeter said Monday. ``I wish I
had the opportunity to play in it longer. We move the ball so
quickly and we don't huddle, and we throw a lot of formations at
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Streeter passed for 279 yards and two touchdowns, and tailback
Travis Zachary rushed for a career-high 141 more as Clemson
compiled 558 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   Now, heading into Saturday's game at No. 13-ranked Georgia Tech
(6-2, 4-2) Streeter and the Tigers (5-4, 5-2) are thinking of not
only bagging the one win needed to qualify for postseason play, but
also claiming second place in the ACC standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't envision it 10 or 11 months ago when I took
the job,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could he have imagined Streeter, a graduate student from
Gettysburg, Pa., would be available as the Tigers, whose 2,267
passing yards are just 33 yards shy of school record, march toward
an improbable turn- around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rolling out to the right, and a North Carolina
linebacker hit me and another player fell on me,'' Streeter said of
the hit that nearly ended his college career. ``The weight of both
of them landed on top of me where my collarbone broke.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing I thought about was that it's my senior season
and that would be my last time playing for Clemson. . . . (But)
when I learned it was a four-to-six week injury, I knew I had to
work and I prayed hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In returning, Streeter sent sophomore Woodrow Dantzler to the
bench. In his second start, against Maryland, Dantzler broke one of
the oldest records in Clemson annals with 435 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work really well together,'' said Streeter, who received a
standing ovation in his final home game Saturday when replaced by
Dantzler. ``We support each other so well. We both really want
what's best for the team.''

EDITORIAL: MEXICO'S POLITICAL EXPERIMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Nov. 9:
</P>
<P>
   Mexico took a step toward greater democracy on Sunday when the
party that has supplied all its presidents for the past 70 years
held a competitive primary to choose next year's presidential
nominee. The primary was an important but not flawless exercise in
free political choice.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the man closest to President Ernesto
Zedillo and the establishment, won a decisive victory over Roberto
Madrazo Pintado, an insurgent governor. But Labastida's triumph was
clouded by questionable campaign practices, such as using
government funds to solicit votes and intimidating Madrazo
supporters. Madrazo also seems to have bent the rules.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the vote count itself seems fair, and that represents
significant progress. The charges of earlier abuse, however, are a
reminder that the PRI's habits of electoral manipulation may die
hard and could resurface in next year's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida is a strong favorite to win next year's vote. Polls
show that a majority of Mexican voters favor one or another
opposition party. But these parties are split by ideology and the
competing egos of their leaders. The PRI needs only to win more
votes than any of its opponents to extend its grip on the
presidency for four more years. But unless the forthcoming election
campaign is more scrupulously policed than Sunday's primary, a
victorious PRI could lack the public confidence it will need to
govern. Opposition candidates must have a fair chance to get their
message out to potential voters or democracy will be shortchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who cited the primary as proof of political reform in
Mexico, needs to make clear before next July's presidential
election that official favoritism on behalf of the PRI candidate
would be no favor to democracy. Washington must also send a clear
message that America's interest in maintaining political stability
in Mexico is best served by a clean campaign and vote.

HOSPITAL TO FORM VENTURE WITH CONSULTANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The First Consulting Group, a health-care consulting
firm, plans to form a venture with New York Presbyterian Hospital
to run the hospital's information-technology and telecommunications
departments, executives said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the agreement, which will be announced
Tuesday, the hospital will pay First Consulting $228 million to
manage its information technology under a new unit, FCG Management
Services, in which the hospital will own a 15 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which will almost double First Consulting's revenue on
paper _ payments will be made in installments during the next seven
years _ is less significant in dollar terms than for the trend it
represents: health care networks turning their increasingly
complicated technical functions over to other parties.
</P>
<P>
   As managed care has increased paperwork, hospital
administrations have been strained. People with the necessary
expertise tend to gravitate toward higher-paying industries. ``As a
nonprofit health institution, we found it difficult to attract good
business-planning people,'' said Louis Reuter, an executive vice
president at New York Presbyterian, who added that many of the best
people left for companies that could offer perks like stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   Other hospitals are almost sure to form similar deals or
contract out their information-technology departments, health-care
experts said. ``The hospitals are behind the times in many respects
in their technical abilities,'' said Henry Moyer, who heads the
Moyer Group, a benefits consulting firm in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals, hurt in recent years by cuts in Medicare
reimbursements and by managed-care plans, have not invested as much
as they needed to, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, while many hurried to correct any year 2000
computer problems earlier in the year, they have since slowed
investments in that area. That has hurt companies like First
Consulting, whose stock has been somewhat volatile. Its shares rose
56.25 cents Monday, to $10.1875, well shy of its 52-week high of
$25 in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospitals have really hunkered down, and there was a
significant drop-off in their spending,'' said James Ackerman, an
analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey &AMP; Co. in Arlington, Va. New
contracts like this one would strengthen the earnings picture for
First Consulting, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Luther Nussbaum, the chief executive of First Consulting, which
is based in Long Beach, Calif., said that the joint venture with
New York Presbyterian signaled the direction he hopes to take his
company in. ``This is a very important venture for us,'' Nussbaum
said. ``Going forward, we see this as the beginning of a trend for
the industry.''

A COMING-TOGETHER OF FOES TO ASSESS THE INTERNET'S IMPACT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Over the weekend, Robert J. Herbold, the chief operating officer
of Microsoft, and James L. Barksdale, the former president of
Netscape Communications, appeared on television and radio and in
newspapers, commenting from opposite sides of the Microsoft
antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, they are putting those differences aside to focus
on a shared interest in high technology as board members of a new
research organization, the Internet Policy Institute. The founders
_ a diverse collection of corporate sponsors, Internet pioneers and
political figures _ say their Washington-based nonprofit institute
is intended to be a source of influential and independent research
for policy makers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is surrounded by noise, hype and marketing, but
there is little hard data on which policy makers can base critical
decisions that will determine the future of the new medium and how
it affects society,'' said Barksdale, co-chairman of the
institute's board and now an independent investor.
</P>
<P>
   The institute, its founders say, has ambitions to become a major
research center _ a kind of ``Brookings Institution for the
Internet,'' according to Kimberly Jenkins, who functions as its
president.
</P>
<P>
   The research group is looking for offices in Washington and
plans to grow quickly over the next couple of years to support 30
or so resident scholars and outside research projects, with an
annual operating budget of $10 million. ``We want to move fast
because the next three to five years is the formative stage when so
many of the key policy decisions will be made about the Internet,''
Ms. Jenkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The institute plans to focus its research on assessing the
Internet's impact in areas including the economy, privacy,
security, government, society and innovation. Along with publishing
its research and sponsoring conferences, it plans to hold briefings
for the presidential candidates on Internet issues starting in
March. It will also support international research projects.

<P>
   The 19-member board is expected to insure that the institute's
work is noticed in both government and industry circles. Barksdale
is an adviser to the Republican front-runner for president, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas. Other board members well connected
politically include Ira Magaziner, a former senior policy adviser
to the Clinton administration; former House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
and Adam Clayton Powell III, vice president for technology programs
of the Freedom Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Internet pioneers on the institute's board include Vinton G.
Cerf, a senior vice president of MCI Worldcom, and Robert E. Kahn,
president of the Corporation for National Research Initiatives. Its
corporate representatives, besides Herbold of Microsoft, include
George Vradenburg III, senior vice president for policy at America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   The board's diversity, the founders say, represents an effort to
make sure that its work will not carry an ideological or political
slant. ``Unlike other organizations focused on the Net, this is not
going to be an advocacy group or a trade association,'' said Esther
Dyson, a board member and currently interim chairwoman of an
Internet governing body for assigning online names and addresses.
``The objective here is to do research without an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   The first project the institute is sponsoring is a study of the
impact of the Internet on the economy, headed by Robert Litan,
director of economic studies at the Brookings Institution, and
Alice M. Rivlin, an economist and former Federal Reserve vice
chairwoman, who is also at Brookings.
</P>
<P>
   The year-long project will try to assess the likely impact of
Internet technology on productivity, prices and costs. The
research, according to Litan, will look forward, trying to assess
the impact of the technology as it is diffused across the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be traditional economics and it won't be easy,''
Litan said. ``But the potential policy implications would be to
help assess the appropriate speed limits on monetary policy in the
future and to assess just how new the so-called new economy really
is.''

NEW PACT SENDS GREEN TO DODGERS FOR MONDESI  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada)   By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANA POINT, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Dodgers finished a distant
third in their division this year, but they are 1-2 in the player
salary standing.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who less than a year ago made Kevin Brown the
highest-paid player in baseball history with a seven-year contract
that averages $15 million a season, Monday made outfielder Shawn
Green No. 2 over all and the highest-paid position player ever with
a six-year contract that averages $14 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The contract completed a trade with the Toronto Blue Jays for
Raul Mondesi that had been contingent on the Dodgers reaching
agreement with Green and his agent, Jeff Moorad. They wrapped it up
with a $4 million signing bonus and salaries of $8.75 million,
$11.5 million, $12.75 million, $15 million and $16 million each of
the last two years. The Dodgers, for the icing, added award bonuses
and a complete no-trade provision. Not bad for a kid who grew up
about 40 miles south of Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers did everything but sing ``Happy Birthday'' to the
outfielder, who turns 27 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The $29-million average annual value of the combined contracts
of Green and Brown exceeds the entire 1999 payrolls of seven teams
_ Pittsburgh, Montreal, Florida, Minnesota, Oakland, Kansas City
and the Chicago White Sox.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Mondesi, also represented by Moorad, had the two
option years in his contract guaranteed by the Blue Jays, who also
added award bonuses for all four years left in the contract in
return for the outfielder waiving his right to demand a trade after
next season as a player traded in the middle of a multiyear
contract. The Blue Jays, who offered Green $48 million for five
years, will pay Mondesi $44.5 million for four years.
</P>
<P>
   Green, whose contract surpassed Mo Vaughn's $13,333,333 a year
as the highest for a position player, may not retain his status for
long. Other players in his circumstance, Ken Griffey Jr., for
example, may be traded and sign contracts that surpass his. Green's
circumstance was that he was a year away from free agency and
unwilling to sign a multiyear contract with a club that didn't want
to keep him around for the 2000 season, then lose him and get
nothing in return.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig was asked his view of the new phenomenon,
advance free agency, earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thrilled to tears over these developments,'' Selig
said after addressing general managers at their annual meetings.
``But it is what it is. It's not a surprising development in
relation to the system. You could see this coming. I may be
surprised at the number, but other than that I'm not really
surprised. Given what has happened to a lot of clubs over the years
about losing players to free agency and not getting anything in
return, this is just a very logical development and not a
surprising one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers began the early exodus of superstars a week
ago when they traded Juan Gonzalez to the Detroit Tigers after
determining it would take more than $12.5 million a year, though
not knowing how much more, to sign the two-time American League
most valuable player.
</P>
<P>
   Green had an mvp-type season with the Blue Jays, hitting .309,
socking 42 home runs and driving in 123 runs among other impressive
statistics. The Blue Jays wanted to sign him to a multiyear
contract, but he told them he wanted to play in a major U.S. city
with a large Jewish population.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm extremely excited,'' Green said at a news conference. ``I
get a chance to play at home. This is a dream come true for me to
play at home and play for this organization that has such a great
tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi, on the other hand, wanted to leave the Dodgers. He had
incidents with the manager and the general manager this past
season. Moorad said he had one last conversation with his client
Monday, before he completed his negotiations with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said you're sure you don't want to be a Dodger,'' the agent
related. ``He said it's been a great organization for me for many
years, but at this point I feel I have to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, the Dodgers' manager, said Mondesi was frustrated
this year with his own performance and the team's.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made an outburst that he apologized for to everybody,''
Johnson said. ``I don't have any problem with him. I think Mondesi
talks to other players like Pedro Martinez or Pedro Astacio or
Roger Cedeno and they seem to blossom in other places. He gets this
idea that you go somewhere else and you really flourish. I tried to
tell him it's not always that way. Each situation is different. The
guys you talked to didn't get the opportunity here. Just because
you go somewhere else doesn't mean it's going to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi had the lowest batting average of his career, .253, but
reached career highs in home runs with 33 and runs batted in with
99. Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general manager, acknowledged that
the high salaries of Green and Brown present problems for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult because you're trying to improve in other
areas,'' he said. ``That's what we're working on, analyzing the
market place and where it's going. We felt it was an opportunity to
get a player of Shawn's caliber, and we had to take that step
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other players were included in the deal. The Blue Jays
received Pedro Borbon Jr., a left-handed relief pitcher, and sent
the Dodgers a minor league infielder, Jorge Nunez. &QL;

NELSON, MAVS LEAVE FOUL ODOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; DALLAS _ If Don Nelson didn't set basketball back far enough
Sunday night in Los Angeles, he just might get another opportunity
to crush the game's aesthetics tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Mavericks meet for the second time in three days,
this time at Reunion Arena, and if the game is close in the fourth
quarter, expect more foul treatment of the Lakers' Shaquille
O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson managed to shave a few points off the Lakers' lead late
Sunday with a series of quick intentional fouls of O'Neal. The game
slowed to a crawl and predictably, O'Neal missed 5 of 10 down the
stretch. But the strategy, while effective, fell short as the
Lakers held on to win 105-97.
</P>
<P>
   So is Lakers coach Phil Jackson worried about another long night
of O'Neal clanking shots off every inch of the rim?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I'm not concerned about it,'' he said. ``Don did that to
the Bulls when Dennis (Rodman) was with us, two years ago. He used
that same format in the third and fourth quarter. Dennis, of
course, made 8 out of 10 free throws in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great experience for Shaq. We think that it's
good for him to have that kind of pressure, to have that
notification, to bring attention to the fact that he's got pressure
on him to carry his weight in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Jackson is thrilled with the strategy, noting that the
NBA in the 1960s discouraged intentional fouling by giving players
three attempts to make two foul shots. To gain ground through
continuous fouling ``strategically makes sense'' but ``is away from
the intent of the game,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Through four games, O'Neal is shooting 39.2 percent from the
line, but Jackson has no other complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's playing great in all aspects of the game except
the free throws, and I don't know if he can do anything about that
until he absolutely changes his mind as to how he's going to
approach shooting foul shots,'' Jackson said. ``Sometimes it's like
an alcoholic . &UR;  &LR; . &UR;  &LR; . they have to actually seek the help to get
response from what they're trying to get.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Money matters: So far, no $5,000 fine from the NBA for
Jackson's criticism of officials in Saturday's loss to Portland. He
doesn't regret the remarks, but he's also not thrilled with paying
a hefty tax on free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never like for money to be taken away from me,'' he said.
``I think that's inappropriate for the league to do that, but
that's their policing activity, and if they want to control the
game as much as they do, I kind of anticipate it will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; __  &LR; Ouch report: Kobe Bryant continued to push forward in his
recovery from a broken right hand. He's now allowed to remove his
protective splint to practice dribbling and shooting, which he did
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt all right,'' he said. ``I don't have my whole
confidence in it. I feel a little tweak going on.''
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to return ahead of the projected Nov. 24 date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you had asked the doctors would I be dribbling
right now, they'd probably have said hell no. So I guess I am ahead
of the game,'' he said. ``Hopefully I'll get back soon, God
willing.'' &UR; !dlim!!end &QL;

LEON STUKELJ, 100, MEDALIST IN GYMNASTICS IN 3 OLYMPICS
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leon Stukelj of Slovenia, a gymnast who was born only two years
after the first modern Olympics and became the oldest living
Olympic gold medalist, died on Monday in Ljubljana, Slovenia. He
was four days short of his 101st birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Stukelj (pronounced SHTOO-kel) competed in three Olympics for
Yugoslavia, of which Slovenia was then a part. He won two gold
medals in 1924, a gold and two bronzes in 1928 and a silver in
1936. Then, at 37, after six Olympic and 14 world championship
medals, he retired from gymnastics. He became a judge and in time
an Olympic hero for the ages.
</P>
<P>
   He was born Nov. 12, 1898, in Novo Mesto. He remembered watching
in person as Johnny Weissmuller (1924 and 1928) and Jesse Owens
(1936) made Olympic history, and he treasured a 1936 photograph
with Owens.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed the Communist regime in Yugoslavia, and after World
War II he was imprisoned for a month and could not get a job for
two years. But when Yugoslavia broke up in 1991, Slovenia was born
as a nation and he became a national idol. He was pictured on
Slovenia's first postage stamp and 5-tolar (about 30-cent) coin.
</P>
<P>
   His first Olympics, in 1924 in Paris, came a few weeks after he
graduated from law school. He won gold medals in the all-around and
the horizontal bar, the first Olympic titles for Yugoslavia, then a
new nation itself. When he returned home, a national holiday was
declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all amateurs then,'' he once recalled. ``No one was
paid. Even at the Olympic Games, we had to look for hotels
ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam, he won a gold medal in the
rings and bronzes in the team and all-around competitions. He
missed the 1932 Los Angeles Olympics because Yugoslavia had no
money to send a team. In the 1936 Berlin Olympics, an old man by
gymnastics standards, he won a silver medal in the rings.
</P>
<P>
   At 65, he retired as a judge and started working for a lawyer.
As he approached 100, he became more of a celebrity and enjoyed it,
but there were never enough hours. ``I have no time for
correspondence and barely any for reading newspapers, literature
and philosophy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He did make time to take care of himself. When he was competing,
each day included a 30-minute workout and a glass of red wine.
Approaching 100, he slept eight or nine hours a day, ate little and
listened to classical music. To others hoping to live long, he
advised, ``Don't smoke, drink little, walk a lot and don't be in a
hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 3 inches and 108 pounds, he remained trim and
energetic. He walked an hour a day, and twice a week he climbed a
nearby hill. He often swung on the gymnastics rings he installed at
home more than 50 years earlier. ``I only exercise on the rings a
couple of times a week,'' he said. ``My muscles are 100 years old,
and too much pressure could strain them.''
</P>
<P>
   At 99, the Old World gentleman who bowed stiffly from the waist
visited a Westchester County (N.Y.) gymnastics school. He
demonstrated the use of the parallel bars by pressing up from the
arms of a chair.
</P>
<P>
   For his 100th birthday, the Slovene government staged a huge
party with the national symphony orchestra, exhibitions by Olympic
gymnasts and a visit from Juan Antonio Samaranch, the president of
the International Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up this morning,'' Stukelj said then, ``I realized
that I'm 100 now, and I thought about it for a while. Then I
realized I'm doing just fine and I'm glad I could come here to be
with you. I had many struggles in my life, but also a lot of
happiness. I look forward to each new day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the physical and mental discipline of gymnastics had
helped keep him young. He also said two sisters lived into their
90s, so ``the basis is probably in the genes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's also the fact that I was always intellectually
active,'' he said. ``And it was essential for me to stay in shape,
and if I wanted to be in shape I had to live healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife of 66 years, Lidija, and a daughter,
also named Lidija.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, when he was inducted into the International Gymnastics
Hall of Fame in Oklahoma City, he was especially honored because
his class included such modern stars as Nadia Comaneci, Olga Korbut
and Mary Lou Retton. Unlike old-timers in many sports, he thought
athletes were much better now. ``Today,'' he said, ``the level of
the events is higher and you can't compare the difficulty of what
they do. But there was a beauty in the exercises before.''

NFL TAKES A TIMEOUT FOR GRIEVING
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pro football coaches often lament that it is nearly impossible
to acquire the complete attention of their players for more than a
reasonable stretch. We stress reasonable. Four or five hours of
work a day and, hey, after that, in many circles, coaches lose
players' eyes, ears and brains, no matter how creative the snatch.
</P>
<P>
   Crafty coaches attempt to keep practices short and crisp,
meetings blunt and brief, film study precise and timely. Today's
players roam toward so many other interests and obligations that
sometimes it is the football regimen that appears to get in the
way.
</P>
<P>
   There are off-field business meetings, to discuss investing
their millions. Family obligations surface. Social events beckon.
And for many, the music industry attracts; it is a venue many of
them view as equal in entertainment value to their own.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, however, a season rolls along and a few events
sprout up that command their total attention. It has been that kind
of season, that kind of week.
</P>
<P>
   This National Football League season began with the shocking
retirement of Detroit's Barry Sanders in a year when he might have
become the league's career rushing leader. In the first week, Jets
quarterback Vinny Testaverde was injured and lost for the year,
drastically altering the Super Bowl chase.
</P>
<P>
   Also early on, last season's Super Bowl running backs _ Jamal
Anderson of the Atlanta Falcons and Terrell Davis of the Denver
Broncos _ each blew a knee, ending their season.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Bowl champion Broncos crawled to an 0-4 start. The
Super Bowl runners-up Falcons did, too.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas Cowboys receiver Michael Irvin recently lay motionless on
the turf and was feared paralyzed. He was not, but is his career
over? Same for quarterback Steve Young, who suffered the fourth
concussion of his career and has not played in six weeks for the
San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   While mighty teams fell, some forlorn ones rose.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants, the Seattle Seahawks, the Detroit Lions and
the St. Louis Rams are first-place teams. It is a mild surprise
that the Jacksonville Jaguars and the Miami Dolphins own the
league's best record at 7-1, both with defenses that glow.
</P>
<P>
   Players across the league have noticed these things. And then in
the last few days, their minds were riveted by death and tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Their football week began with the death of Walter Payton at age
45 from bile duct cancer last Monday. It ended with the stunning
news Sunday that the wife and child of defensive back Steve
Muhammad of the Indianapolis Colts had both died.
</P>
<P>
   Payton's death shook the players to the core. He was not much
older than they are. Most had followed his career and found it
inspiring. Before every NFL kickoff Sunday, there was a moment of
silence in remembrance of Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Chicago Bears players took notice. Last week they
apparently practiced in a manner that they seldom had. They were a
3-5 team playing at the Green Bay Packers, tackling a bunch that
had defeated them 10 consecutive times.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago won, 14-13, blocking a field-goal attempt by the Packers
on the last play of the game. The Bears, to a man, were on a
mission, attentive and in tune. How else can such a game be
explained?
</P>
<P>
   The Colts did not learn until after beating the Kansas City
Chiefs that Muhammad's wife, Nichole, had died at an Indianapolis
hospital during their game and that the Muhammads' child was
stillborn.
</P>
<P>
   The news devastated players around the league and especially the
Colts. At least three Colts and their wives are expecting children:
Cornelius Bennett, Jeff Burris and Chad Cota.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw her out of the complex on Wednesday,'' Bennett said.
``Today she's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   With the season half complete, the stage has been set. This is
not an ordinary NFL season by any standard. It is odd in nature,
shocking in game results and tragically twisted in scope.
</P>
<P>
   The league spins toward Super Bowl XXXIV with anticipation of
the unexpected, with a new order among its teams and, in many
instances, with heavy hearts.
</P>
<P>
   It churns with more players alert, more with wide-open eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes after a game, when I talk about God, some of the
writers look at me like I'm crazy,'' said Chris Hayes, 27, of the
Jets. ``But that's where my understanding comes from. I wonder how
others find a way to make sense of some of the stuff that's going
on. There's a lot out there, for sure. All the guys around the
league are talking about it. We feel it. We notice.''

NEW YORK-HAVANA FLIGHTS WILL RESUME 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Almost 40 years after the last Havana-bound
commercial airplane took off from a New York City airport, flights
between the two cities will resume next month, fulfilling one of
the key elements of the Clinton administration's more relaxed
policy toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The direct flights are expected to start Dec. 3 from Kennedy
Airport. While it will remain illegal for Americans to travel to
Cuba as tourists, the flights will make it easier and faster for
the thousands of Cuban-Americans in the New York-New Jersey region
to visit relatives on the island legally.
</P>
<P>
   It will also ease travel for an increasing number of U.S.
citizens from the Northeast traveling as scholars, journalists or
members of religious groups, who are exempt from the American
embargo on trade and travel to Cuba. Until now, flying to Havana
has required traveling through Miami, the Bahamas or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Marazul Charters has been approved by both governments to handle
the flights. The company, which has already started selling tickets
from its office in Weehawken, N.J., has scheduled one flight per
week to Cuba that will leave Kennedy at 8:35 p.m. on Fridays, with
a return flight scheduled for before dawn every Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, a Democrat of Harlem, said he believed
the flights would help normalize relations between the two
countries and might encourage his colleagues in Congress to move
toward lifting the decades-old embargo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason today why we can't trade with Cuba,''
Rangel said Monday at a breakfast sponsored by Marazul Charters.
``The more people travel to Cuba and come back with stories that
the Cuban people really love us, the better it is.''
</P>
<P>
   About 140,000 Americans travel to Cuba every year, said John
Kavulich II, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council,
a New York group that advocates the lifting of the embargo. About
25,000 travel illegally through third countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kavulich said that 92 percent of the people who travel to the
island legally were Cuban-Americans with relatives there. He also
said that American business people were increasingly traveling to
the island in anticipation that the embargo will be lifted; by the
end of this year, he said, 3,000 business people will have traveled
to Cuba, 500 more than last year.
</P>
<P>
   The direct flights from New York will be flown by Grupo Taca, an
alliance of Central American airlines, and a round trip will cost
$629; most of the 150 seats on the first flight have already been
sold, Marazul officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these flights we hope to provide needed services, but we
are also creating a link between the financial capital of the world
and Havana,'' said Francisco Aruca, president of Marazul Charters.
``Within the law, we stand ready to facilitate communication
between the two countries, in accordance with the new policy of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, President Clinton announced a series of
measures intended to increase contacts between people in the United
States and the people of Cuba. They included expanding direct
charter flights, allowing more Americans _ not just those with
relatives on the island _ to send money to Cubans, establishing
direct mail and permitting the sale of food and agricultural
supplies to nongovernmental entities.
</P>
<P>
   The president's initiative was well received by those who oppose
the embargo and by many who support it. Some supporters of the
embargo, who fear that tourism would amount to economic support for
Cuba's communist leader, Fidel Castro, described the initiative as
a sign that the president was committed to keep a tough policy
toward Cuba while helping families. Opponents of sanctions said the
president's announcement was an opening that could help unite the
voices of people asking Congress to lift the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Collazo, an official with the Cuban Interest Section in
Washington, Cuba's only formal diplomatic presence in the United
States, said Monday that the direct flights would contribute to
``normalcy in the communications and the relations between Cuban
families, here and over there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Yvonne Conde, a freelance writer in Manhattan who left Cuba
38 years ago and has never been back, said she feared the flights
would facilitate travel to Cuba for those who have no family there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays, anyone can be a scholar,'' she said. ``Anybody can
say they are doing research, when in fact it is tourism. I can't
condemn anyone who goes to Cuba to see relatives, but I find
tourism to Cuba appalling.''

FEDERAL JUDGE UPHOLDS MAINE'S CAMPAIGN-FINANCE LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Mass., Vt.)  (lb) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In a victory for advocates of an overhaul of how
campaigns are financed, a federal judge has upheld Maine's
groundbreaking Clean Election Law, ruling that the incentives it
offers to candidates to take public money instead of private
contributions are constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Voters approved the measure in 1996, putting the state in the
forefront of the movement for full public financing of campaigns,
or what supporters call ``clean money.'' Since then, the Vermont
Legislature and voters in Massachusetts and Arizona have approved
similar measures. All the states offer candidates who qualify a set
amount of public money to cover their campaigns. In return, the
candidates agree to spend no more than that amount.
</P>
<P>
   In all four states, the public financing laws have encountered
obstacles. Legal challenges also have arisen in Vermont and
Arizona, where, like Maine, the new finance rules take effect for
next year's election. In Massachusetts, where the new financing
measure will take effect in the 2002 election, lawmakers seem to be
balking at providing money for the new law.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of laws to provide public financing for campaigns
hailed the decision by Judge Brock Hornby of U.S. District Court,
which was released late Friday, as a significant legal precedent
and a boost for state-level attempts to change from the ground up
how campaigns are financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a big green light for clean elections to take effect
here in Maine, to take effect in Massachusetts and Vermont and
Arizona, where they've also been challenged in court,'' said John
Brautigam, director of legal advocacy for the Maine Citizen
Leadership Fund, which helped defend against the suit.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the law, which include the American Civil Liberties
Union, the Maine Libertarian Party, political action committees,
campaign contributors and some candidates, plan to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lopez, a lawyer for the ACLU, said that the organization
supported the idea of public financing. But, he said, ``the basic
premise of the case was that the public financing system they
adopted in Maine was structured in a way to coerce maximum
participation,'' rather than allowing candidates a real choice
about whether to take public money.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine law not only gives public money to candidates willing
to accept overall campaign spending limits, he said, but also
lowers the limits on contributions that people and groups can make
to privately financed candidates, making it harder for candidates
to run without public financing.
</P>
<P>
   Hornby has not ruled on the challenges to Maine's contribution
limits, which were included in the Clean Election Law. The campaign
limits dropped from $1,000 from an individual or $5,000 from a
group, to $250 across the board, Brautigam said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In his ruling on Friday, Hornby noted that opponents had raised
several objections to the new law, including the complaint that it
involved certifying publicly financed candidates as ``clean,''
implying that their privately financed opponents were not.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents also complained that the levels of spending set for
publicly financed candidates were too low to foster hearty public
discourse. They also took issue with the mechanism by which money
spent outside a privately financed candidate's campaign could
trigger matching public funds for that candidate's publicly funded
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine law provides incentives to candidates to take public
financing, Hornby wrote, ``but the incentives hardly are
overwhelming or of an order that can be said to create profound
disparities.'' And state officials testified, he said, that they
would call publicly financed candidates ``certified'' rather than
``clean.''
</P>
<P>
   In addressing opponents' complaints concerning matching money,
Hornby wrote, ``their view is that there is no point in speaking if
your opponent gets heard as well.'' But the First Amendment aims to
promote a marketplace of ideas, he wrote, and so ``the public can
only gain when the opposing candidate speaks in return.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar court challenges are facing Vermont's campaign-finance
measure, passed in 1997, which includes lowered contribution
limits, making it vulnerable to accusations of First Amendment
violations.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, the new campaign-finance law faces two challenges,
both brought by the Arizona Chamber of Commerce, said Sharlene
Bozack, executive director of the Clean Elections Institute, the
group that led the initiative that passed the law. The challenges
focus in part on the source of the public money for the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the state Legislature each year must
appropriate money for the public financing of campaigns. And this
year, the first for the new measure, the lawmakers are holding up
the money. Among the conditions they have set for approving the
money is a constitutional review of the law, said David Donnelly,
director of Massachusetts Voters for Clean Elections, the group
that successfully led the ballot initiative here.
</P>
<P>
   The Maine decision, with its constitutional stamp of approval,
``certainly clears one hurdle out of the way toward implementation
of the law in Massachusetts,'' Donnelly said. But still, he said,
he fears that the law's opponents ``are going to try to use the
courtrooms or legislative back rooms to try to defeat reform.''

ROTISSERIE TO REALITY: INTERACTIVITY THE FUTURE OF INTERNET SPORTS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is one surfer's vision of a cool application of sports on
the Internet in the not-too-distant future:
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Peyton Manning is outfitted with a button-sized
multimedia transmitter on his Indianapolis Colts helmet. The tiny
camera, accessed by millions of users from an NFL-sanctioned site,
follows everything Manning sees and picks up everything he hears.
</P>
<P>
   Other players are rigged the same way.
</P>
<P>
   If this ever happens, users can experience an NFL game as if
they're on the field _ free from the dangers of concussions or
serious injury _ all from the comforts of their personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is one surfer's vision. What about an analyst
who follows the sports technology industry and has access to the
think tank?
</P>
<P>
   Aram Sinnreich, consumer content analyst for Jupiter
Communications, an industry watchdog, said a peak into the future
is as close as ABC's Enhanced TV (heavy.etv.go.com/snfnow)
interactive site.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Enhanced TV allows users to play a Java-powered online
game that's in synchronization with the Monday Night Football
telecast. Users can also access real-time statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes the enjoyment of the game, as a user on the Internet,
that much more intense,'' Sinnreich said. ``It allows you to get
more involved with the game directly.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinnreich's colleague, Patrick Keane of Jupiter Communications,
told Yahoo! Internet Life that with Internet access built into many
of the new video-game systems, virtual leagues will bridge the gap
between ``rotisserie and reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Interactivity is only to get more intense as technology
develops, Sinnreich said. ``A lot of that depends on how people are
accessing the Internet, as we move from a two-screen \RTV and
computer monitor\S to a one-screen experience with integrated
content,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sinnreich said he foresees the technology advancing
so that hot links are embedded in a video stream for e-commerce
purposes. Users will be able to click on the live moving image of a
player and be able to buy the team's official jersey. Or the user
can access the player's real-time statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the programming available down the line,'' he said.
``Clearly the technology isn't there, but that's the direction.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is broadband, the technology in progress that
channels all of the multimedia into one cybercast pipeline.
Sinnreich predicted that 25 percent of all homes with Internet will
be able to handle broadband capabilities by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make a huge difference,'' Sinnreich said. ``It's
not going to look like TV; it's going to be video on demand. Let's
say you missed the big home run of the day. Rather than catch it on
the news, you go to a site and see it on demand.''
</P>
<P>
   As for a player's-eye-view, such as helmet cams, Sinnreich said
his job as an analyst is not to make pie-in-the-sky predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something to think about,'' he said. ``I'm sure someone
out there is thinking about it.''
</P>
<P>
   SCORING AT HOME: Viewers of the Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis
fight, scheduled Saturday on pay-per-view, can score the fight from
home on Excite &LR; Home (sports.excite.com).
</P>
<P>
   Showtime's fight sites provide online scoring, but this is
Excite\NHome's first effort at providing round-by-round scoring.
Results of the fans' scoring are scheduled to be posted after the
fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it could work well, given the little controversy of
the last fight (which was a draw),'' said Shira B. Kallus, a
spokeswoman for Redwood City, Calif.-based Excite &LR; Home.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKING ODD ODDS: Sportsbook.com, a betting site based in
Margarita Island, Venezuela, is booking action on which NBA player
will ``succumb to the pitfalls of life and surrender to the
pressure on stardom in the NBA.'' Peter Childs, Sportsbook.com's
bookmaker, said in a news release that the odds-on favorite is the
Atlanta Hawks' Isaiah Rider (3-to-1).

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Already the master of the rope line and televised
town meeting, President Clinton took a technological leap into the
computer age Monday night by becoming the first president to
participate in a live Internet chat.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who describes himself as old-fashioned and
technologically challenged when it comes to computers, never
touched a keyboard or a mouse. He merely sat in front of a Toshiba
laptop on a stage at George Washington University and responded
verbally to questions sent to him.
</P>
<P>
   His remarks scrolled word for word across thousands of computer
screens, thanks to voice recognition software. The president
appeared in a tiny box, and could be seen putting his hand to his
chin, sipping from a soda can and looking amused at the entire
extravaganza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like FDR's fireside chats and President Kennedy's live press
conferences, this first presidential town hall meeting on the
Internet taps the most modern technology for old-fashioned
communication between the American people and their president,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a real town meeting, which allows back and forth between
the president and the audience, this one had plenty of stage
managing, with questions screened by the event's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was online but it wasn't a chat,'' said Mike Cornfield, a
professor at George Washington University who specializes in online
politics and watched the event from the audience. ``This could have
been a national conversation. Instead we had a bunch of politicians
telling us what they thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the questions were softballs on health care, gun control
and other issues that Clinton has answered many times before. He
mixed serious policy answers with chuckles at occasional technical
glitches and some of the e-mail names of the questioners _ monikers
like T Love and Sissy Bill.
</P>
<P>
   A questioner using the name GBH1935 asked Clinton how people who
are not computer literate will be affected by the computer
revolution. The president spoke of the seriousness of the ``digital
divide'' between those connected to the Internet and those who are
unwired. Economic prospects for the poor would increase, Clinton
said, if ``we have the same density of computer and Internet access
that we have with telephone access.''
</P>
<P>
   Another questioner, Cynthia in Arizona, wondered whether Clinton
would stockpile food for the start of the new millennium if he were
a ``ordinary citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said there was no need for anybody to bunker down in
fear. ``The United States is doing fine and I wouldn't hoard food
and I wouldn't hide,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The president's participation in the virtual town hall meeting
on Excite(AT)Home was another first in the rapidly changing world
of cyberspace, which has transformed entertainment, education and
commerce and is moving rapidly into politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a sitting president to do this is not only groundbreaking
but it shows how the Internet is becoming a fundamental tool in
politics,'' said Tom Hockaday, president of Campaign Solutions, a
concern based in Alexandria, Va., that helps candidates use the Web
to enhance their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Web is already used by politicians to raise money, gather
volunteers and spread campaign themes to potential voters. Those in
the field envision a day when e-mail replaces 30-second television
advertisements and even voting takes place with the click of a
mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use the word telegenic to describe those skilled on
television and someday we're going to have a word for a politician
who is very good on the Net,'' said Cornfield, who heads an
Internet research organization called Democracy Online.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Compared with other celebrity chats, Clinton's event, limited to
50,000 participants, was modest indeed. Pop singer Britney Spears
drew a record 234,000 participants in her celebrity chat on America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers for Clinton's town hall were about the same as those
for past Web chats with singers Michael Jackson and Rod Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledges that he is better at talking Internet
policy than actually surfing the Net. Aides said that Clinton owns
a computer but does not use it on his desk in the Oval Office and
prefers to write notes longhand. ``He's definitely been on the
Internet,'' one aide said. ``He's sent e-mails but he basically is
from the era of the typewriter.''
</P>
<P>
   Just the same, Clinton frequently mentions in speeches the need
to connect schools in poor neighborhoods to the Internet and
prepare for the next millennium with a technologically advanced
workforce. But Clinton has ceded technology to Vice President Al
Gore, who unlike his boss knows that spam is not a processed lunch
meat and that RAM is a computer storage device, not a horned
animal.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who boasted in an interview that he helped invent the
Internet, held his first electronic town meeting in 1994 _ a
primitive event by today's standards that drew 900 people and was
held on a dinosaur of a computer, a Compaq 486. Midway through, the
transmission went haywire and ``Iba+iuXE ytoo'' appeared on Gore's
screen.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether history will make note of
Clinton's chat, perhaps alongside Woodrow Wilson's first formal
news conference, Franklin D. Roosevelt's fireside chats and Dwight
D. Eisenhower's media briefings over that cutting-edge technology
called television.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday this will look like the first flight at Kitty Hawk _
not too impressive, pretty crude, but it was the first,'' said
Craig Crawford, editor in chief of Hotline, the Web-based political
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The event was as political and commercial as it was historic.
The idea was conceived at the Democratic Leadership Council, which
used the event to show off centrists it hoped would help fill
Clinton's shoes in the next century. Excite(AT)Home, the Internet
concern that provided the technology, saw the chat as a way to
publicize its Internet chat software.
</P>
<P>
   Participating from other sites across the country were Mayor Don
Cunningham of Bethlehem, Pa.; Mayor Ron Gonzales of San Jose,
Calif.; Assemblyman Antonio Riley of Wisconsin; Gov. Jeanne Shaheen
of New Hampshire; and Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend of
Maryland. Also involved in the chat were Al From, president of the
Democratic Leadership Council, who was the moderator, and Marc
Andreessen, the founder of Netscape.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Cunningham, who at 34 is one of the country's youngest mayors,
said he uses his computer every day, but understands why Clinton
may not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is in the same generation as my father, the
50-something baby boomers,'' Cunningham said in an interview.
``Some of them are into computers and some of them are not. My
father just got e-mail. But the world is changing and this event
shows that everyone has to get online, even the president.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Maury Wills is sitting there in the restaurant booth across from
me, and I remember back to that magical summer of 1962 when he
revolutionized base-stealing and changed forever how baseball was
played in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my MVP year,'' says Wills softly. ``A great year. A
memorable year. Broke Ty Cobb's stolen base record. Actually, set a
record that never will be broken. Played in 165 regular season
games. Remember, we finished tied with the San Francisco Giants,
and in those non-playoff days they settled ties in a best-of-three
series. And it went the full three games. Unfortunately, we blew
the last one. Still, a wonderful season...''
</P>
<P>
   Maury Wills smiles gently in fond remembrance of that long-ago
season when he altered the fabric of the national pastime with his
104 stolen bases that brought the running game into a game that
long had ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   He is 67 years old now, but he doesn't look it and still weighs
the lithe 170 pounds he did when he was inspiring ``Go! Go! Go!''
chants at Dodger Stadium and when he was streaking around the bases
leading the light-hitting Dodgers to unlikely National League
pennants and World Series championships.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale did the pitching for those Dodger
teams of the 1960s, but it was the fast legs and inexhaustible
spirit of Wills that propelled them to their dizzying heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stole bases to help us win games, not to set any records,''
says Wills. ``If my intent were to steal as many bases as I could,
I probably could have stole 150 or 160 in 1962.''
</P>
<P>
   I look at Maury Wills, and I get the feeling the old shortstop
smiles through a wounded heart because he has become the Forgotten
Man of his sport, shunted into the shadows in recent years despite
his heroic achievements across the 13 blazing seasons he spent in
the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   While there has been an understandable furor about Pete Rose's
absence from the Hall of Fame, no one has vocally stood up and
railed about the injustice of Wills not having a plaque hanging in
Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   All Wills did during his career was bat .281, collect 2,134
hits, steal 586 bases, play on four NL pennant-winning and three
World Series-winning Dodger teams, and alter forever the contours
of his sport.
</P>
<P>
   He has a higher lifetime batting average than Phil Rizzuto
(.273), Pee Wee Reese (.269) and Luis Aparicio (.262) and stole
more bases than all of them. And none of those players came faintly
close to impacting games like Wills routinely did throughout his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Phil Rizzuto, Pee Wee Reese and Luis Aparicio are
shortstops who have been enshrined in the Hall of Fame, while Wills
hasn't even been given serious consideration despite his
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't give you a reason why I haven't made it,'' says
Wills, slowly shaking his head. ``I wish I knew. I've always been
late in doing things in my life. I was nearly 27 before I was
brought up by the Dodgers. Maybe it'll be the same way with the
Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   There are those who believe that Maury Wills has been shunned in
the Hall of Fame voting because of the serious drug problem that he
endured throughout most of the 1980s, including his brief but
disastrous managerial tour with the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   If this is the main reason, then it's pure humbug because the
Hall of Fame has in it men who were hopeless alcoholics, certified
bigots, addicted gamblers, outrageous misogynists, and those with
various other vexing shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   It's ridiculous that Wills would be shut out of the Hall of Fame
because of what he did after (italicize after) his playing days
were long finished, but there are those in the baseball
establishment who insist this is the case.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Wills has been clean now for nine years, and all I know
about Wills is that he just might have been the most fiercely
competitive baseball player I've ever seen perform, if not among
the most exciting.
</P>
<P>
   Wills grew up in Washington D.C., and signed as a pitcher with
the Dodgers in 1950.
</P>
<P>
   ``But once I went to spring training camp in Vero Beach, and saw
how many minor league pitchers the Dodgers had, I quickly became an
infielder,'' says Wills.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls returning to his hometown in the off-season, and
watching an incredible basketball player at Phelps High School who
totally dominated games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We called him the `Rabbit,' ''says Wills. ``Never seen anyone
jump, or hang like he could. His name was Elgin Baylor.''
</P>
<P>
   Maury Wills bounced around the minor leagues for 8{ seasons
before he finally was called up by the Dodgers in June of 1959, and
it wasn't easy for a young black athlete in those Jim Crow days in
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget the time I was playing in Ft. Worth, Texas,
and I got in the bus and sat on a bench in the front of it,'' says
Wills. ``The bus didn't move and the driver turned and glared and
me and said, `Hey, boy, get your ass in the back where you belong.'
I've never felt so embarrassed in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Maury Wills endured the slights and the rejections, and
season after season kept playing minor league baseball for the
Dodgers when the manager his Spokane team, Bobby Bragan, made a
suggestion to him in the July of 1958 that would turn his life
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bragan told me I had been in a seven and a half year slump
batting right handed,'' says Wills. ``He told me with my speed that
I should try switch-hitting. And he worked with me for a few days
before I tried it. Bragan also taught me how to bunt and how to hit
to the left side of the infield.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest, of course, is history.
</P>
<P>
   Maury Wills soon would be leading the NL every year in bunt
singles and infield hits, and would become the scourge of rival
pitchers because of his running skills.
</P>
<P>
   He says Juan Marichal was the best pitcher he ever faced, and
reveals he was partly responsible for the infamous incident in 1965
when Marichal took a bat to John Roseboro's noggin.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the game the night before against the Giants, we needed a
run badly and I was determined to get it any way I could,'' relates
Wills. ``Well, I faked a bunt, pulled the bat back on purpose, and
it hit the mask of the Giant catcher, Tom Haller. The umpire
awarded me first base on an obstruction call. I immediately stole a
couple of bases, and scored a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, the next inning, the Giants' Mattie Alou tried the same
tactic, but John Roseboro didn't fall for it. Alou kept trying to
hit Roseboro in the mask with the bat, and finally did. Roseboro
lifted Alou up, and warned him never to do that again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Marichal was mad about what Roseboro did to
Alou---both were from the Dominican Republic---and so in the first
inning the next day Marichal knocked me, Jim Gilliam and Ron Fairly
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really steamed up Roseboro, and he begged Sandy Koufax to
do the same to the Giant hitters. But Sandy wouldn't do it. So
Roseboro told me he was going to hit Marichal in the face with the
ball when Marichal came to bat. But, instead, he nicked Marichal's
ear with the ball, and that started the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Maury Wills stays busy these days, working as a base-running
coach for the Toronto Blue Jays, serving as the director of public
relations for Mainline Incorporated in Torrance, attending
memorabilia card shows and giving drug abuse speeches around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   He lives alone in a condominium in Rancho Palos Verdes, and
regularly dates a tall, attractive lady from Huntington Beach.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon at Phil Trani's, the two are celebrating
her birthday, and Maury Wills is the picture of contentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good life,'' he says. ``And it would be complete if I
make it into the Hall of Fame. I just hope I do before I die.''

JOHN G. BONOMI, 76, LAWYER WHO SOUGHT TO DISBAR NIXON 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John G. Bonomi, a lawyer who investigated the role of organized
crime in professional boxing and later successfully sought the
disbarment of President Richard Nixon, died on Saturday at his home
in Irvington, N.Y. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   As an assistant district attorney in Manhattan from 1953 to
1960, Bonomi investigated dozens of figures connected to boxing,
including Frankie Carbo, the so-called underworld commissioner of
the sport, and James D. Norris, the multimillionaire president of
the International Boxing Club.
</P>
<P>
   Bonomi's work led to Norris' stepping down as president of the
boxing club and the organization's dissolution. Carbo was convicted
on charges of managing boxers without a license; he was sentenced
to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation also brought Bonomi, a former collegiate
boxer, to the attention of Sen. Estes Kefauver, D-Tenn., who
appointed him special counsel to the Subcommittee for Antitrust and
Monopoly when it held hearings on professional boxing in 1960 and
1961.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearings, Jake La Motta, a former middleweight champion,
admitted that in 1947 he threw a bout at Madison Square Garden with
Billy Fox, then an undefeated light heavyweight.
</P>
<P>
   Bonomi worked in 1961 and 1962 as a special assistant attorney
general in New York investigating racist and anti-Semitic
literature distributed in the New York campaign for mayor.
</P>
<P>
   From 1963 to 1976, Bonomi was chief counsel for grievances for
the Association of the Bar of the City of New York. In 1974, he
started an investigation that resulted in 1976 in the disbarment of
Nixon in New York on grounds related to the Watergate scandal and
interfering with the legal defense of Daniel Ellsberg, who was on
trial on charges connected with the publication of the Pentagon
Papers.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had voluntarily given up his license to practice law in
California and before the Supreme Court of the United States and
sought to do the same in New York. The New York bar, however,
refused to allow Nixon to give up his license voluntarily unless he
acknowledged, as state law requires, that he could not successfully
defend himself against the charges. In Nixon's case the charges
included five counts of obstruction of ``the due administration of
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   John Gurnee Bonomi, who was known as Jack, was born in in
Brooklyn in 1923. He graduated from Columbia University and
received a law degree from Cornell University and a master's degree
in law from New York University. He served in the Army Air Corps in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, Bonomi was a visiting scholar at Harvard Law School,
specializing in professional conduct. From 1977 to 1996 he was in
private practice, often defending lawyers and judges accused of
misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the committee for grievances and admissions
for the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, a lecturer at Fordham
University Law School, a columnist for The New York Law Journal, a
trustee of the Village of Tarrytown, N.Y., a councilman and deputy
supervisor of the town of Greenburgh, N.Y., and special council to
the village of Irvington.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Patricia; a daughter, Kathryn Bonomi
of Tarrytown; a son, John G. Bonomi Jr. of Manhattan, and a
granddaughter.

 By GINIA BELLAFANTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all its efforts at imaginativeness, for all its
frequent abhorrence of common sense, the fashion world can be a
pretty literal place. If it weren't, then its members might not be
so infatuated with expensive handbags, those money holders meant to
show the world that you are holding lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   In this Gucci-Prada-Fendi moment, it comes as little surprise
that there is a revival of another Italian handbag house, one also
with a history of turning out luxurious, logoed products that by
virtue of their ubiquity straddled the line between gaucheness and
good taste.
</P>
<P>
   Off the radar of the status-conscious for decades, Roberta di
Camerino bags resurfaced in 1996 at Barneys New York. They're now
being sold at Neiman Marcus, where they were first made available
in the 1950s; this spring, they'll dress the shelves at Jeffery in
New York and Atlanta. Camerino bags are also on display at the
Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology through Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the postwar period, Roberta di Camerino bags _
typically made from cut velvet, often shaped like doctors' satchels
_ swung on the arms of celebrities on the continuum of chic from
Grace Kelly to Farrah Fawcett. In 1980, the company's designer and
founder, Giuliana di Camerino, shut down production of the purses
to focus on profitable licensing deals for everything from ties and
scarves to aprons and wallpaper.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, however, Barneys' general merchandise manager,
Judy Collinson, spotted the bags at a flea market and foresaw their
potential for a rebirth. The store contacted the company and
convinced it to produce bags again, including models from its
archives as well as newer styles.
</P>
<P>
   The company is now selling $15 million worth of merchandise in
the United States through major retailers, as well as specialty
shops, said Francesco Pellati, its managing director. New, the bags
sell for $500 to $2,000. The vintage ones are commanding high
prices at auction, as well as at swank shops like Resurrection on
East Seventh Street and Mott Street.
</P>
<P>
   Older Camerinos, in fact, are avidly collected by designers like
Anna Sui, who was given two purses a few years ago by her friend
Marc Jacobs and since has amassed a collection too large to count.
``She has the best hardware I've ever seen on handbags,'' Ms. Sui
said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliana di Camerino, a native of Venice, Italy, got into the
luxury-goods business as few other designers have: through dire
necessity. A Jew, she was forced to flee Mussolini's Italy in
November 1943. With her husband, a banker, she escaped by train to
Lugano, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   They had no income, so Mrs. Camerino began to sew and managed to
make herself a leather satchel. A woman on the street liked it
enough to buy it on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this moment, people knew we needed to have money,'' Mrs.
Camerino said last week in a telephone interview from Switzerland,
where she lives for part of the year. Soon after this sale, a local
leather-goods store hired her to make bags.
</P>
<P>
   Following the war, she returned to Venice to start her business,
naming it Roberta di Camerino after the 1933 musical ``Roberta.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Camerino, who won't reveal her age, is not one to be
self-effacing. Of the striped velvet bags she made in the '40s and
'50s, she said, ``To put together three different colors in this
period was a revolution.'' Of her first fashion show in Venice in
1949, one that used theatrics, she maintained, ``It was the first
fashion show done like a production.'' (In reality, it was not.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard to dispute Mrs. Camerino's claim of being
copied by other, better-known designers. ``In the bag business,
everyone's going to say that,'' said Candy Pratts Price, the former
accessories director of Vogue, but she added, it would be difficult
to contend that Mrs. Camerino's bag shapes have not been widely
imitated.
</P>
<P>
   One can see the designer's influence in the velvet, jewel-tone
bags that Prada showed a few seasons ago. Mrs. Camerino recalled
that her friend Coco Chanel, no stranger to being knocked off, once
told her that she would shed tears the day no one copied her.

`X-FILES' IS NEARING THE END, SO LET'S JUST ENJOY THE RIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - It's standard network practice - Fox sent an advance
tape of the season premiere of The X-Files, along with a request
that critics ``not reveal any integral plot information.''
</P>
<P>
   No problem. I only wish I could.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a moral imperative holding me back. It's just that,
even though I'm a big X-Files fan, the season premiere left me
baffled. It's the second of a three-part story that began with last
season's final episode and concludes next week.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing tip: If you've got last season's finale on tape, dig it
out. You'll need to do your homework to make any sense at all of
this episode, which finds Mulder in the psychiat ric ward of a
hospital, his mind busy working overtime while his body isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Scully, meanwhile, is off the coast of Africa; the truth is
still out there, this time sitting in the ocean a few feet in front
of her tent.
</P>
<P>
   As Mulder, David Duchovny lies around more or less out of it for
most of the episode _ which, come to think of it, isn't that
different from his usual acting style. Gillian Anderson, as Scully,
emotes early and often, assuring Assistant Direc tor Skinner that
Mulder is not dying _ in fact, ``He's more alive than he's ever
been. He's more alive than his body can stand. And what's causing
it may be extraterrestrial in origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Confusing? Of course. This is the X-Files, remember.
</P>
<P>
   X-Files episodes fall into two cat egories, the so-called
mythology shows, which chronicle a cloudy government conspiracy
involving UFOs and which only series creator Chris Carter seems to
truly under stand (and I have my doubts about him), and stand-alone
episodes that are scary, weird, funny and some times all three.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, X-Files fans split into two camps as well. The
hard-core fans love the mythology episodes while pretending to
under stand them. The rest of us can't get enough of the
stand-alone shows, which have dealt with such appetiz ing topics as
in-breeding, circus freaks and a fluke man who made his home for a
time in the sewer.
</P>
<P>
   That's why last season, which was loaded with whimsical
episodes, was such a delight _ to everyone but the true-believing
X-Filers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it probably has something to do with being in the
sixth year of a show,'' Duchovny told TV critics this summer. ``You
start to wink at the audience in some way, just because you have a
history with the audience. . . . I think that people got scared
because they all happened to occur in one spate there, like five or
six in a row, and people went, `Oh my God, it's Ally McBeal.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Ally McBeal, that show and The X-Files are the only
life rafts in what's becoming a shipwreck of a season for Fox.
Thus, the probability that this is The X-Files' last season looms
even larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say `never' about any thing,'' Duchovny said, ``but
as of right now, my contract is up at the end of this coming year,
so I'm living my life as if this would be the last year, and I'd be
fine if it were the last year.''
</P>
<P>
   So fine, in fact, that Duchovny has sued 20th Century Fox Film
Corp., claiming that Fox gave its FX cable channel and its
broadcast stations favorable licensing deals for reruns of The
X-Files, thereby undercutting bigger money that could have been
made by seeking higher bids.
</P>
<P>
   With all that in mind, what does the coming season hold? Well,
inscruta ble plots, iffy endings and more ``mythology'' episodes
that are starting to play out like the world's longest bad sci-fi
movie, certainly. But how about Mulder and Scully? Will they, you
know . . . you know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't tell you how uninterested in that I am, really,''
Duchovny said. ``I could not make it clear enough. I don't mean to
be rude when I say that. It's just not interesting to me in any
way, shape or form, and thank fully, it doesn't have to be, because
I don't have to write the show.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, got it. Romantic relationship: Doesn't care. How about how
the conspiracy theories will finally play out?
</P>
<P>
   ``Again, without wanting to be rude, I care as little about that
as I care about the relationship,'' Duchovny said.
</P>
<P>
   Check. Conspiracy theories: Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny was, however, willing to put the series into
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that at its heart, at its base, at its core, it was
just a (expletive) good show, you know?'' he said. ``And it was fun
and it was exciting and it was well-written and it was well-acted
and it was well-directed. And sure, it had some kooky ele ments
that might have been, you know, end-of-the-century oriented. But in
the end, it was just cool and it was good and it was different.''
</P>
<P>
   And, at its best, almost under standable.
</P>
<P>
   Duchovny certainly sounds like a man coming to terms with the
end of the series. So, then, should we. Let's just enjoy it while
we've got it. We can try to figure it all out later. Reach Bill
Goodykoontz at (602) 444-8974, or at bill.goody koontz &LR; pni.com.

 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shortly after 4:30 a.m. on Oct. 31, Lewis D.
Schiliro, the top FBI official in New York, was awakened by a call
from one of his deputies with the news that EgyptAir Flight 990 had
crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro says he immediately turned on CNN, worked the
telephones, and then drove to Kennedy International Airport, where
dozens of his agents were already fanning out to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   While the scene was eerily similar to the bureau's response to
the Trans World Airlines Flight 800 crash in 1996, this time the
FBI has taken a secondary public role in the crash investigation,
as the National Transportation Safety Board is directing the latest
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Schiliro made his first trip to Rhode Island, where the
crash investigation and recovery effort is being directed. He said
by phone Monday night that he had observed ``what a phenomenal
effort is taking place up here,'' adding that a resolution of the
case is ``certainly not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his visit and the involvement of hundreds of FBI agents
in the inquiry, the low profile of both Schiliro and the bureau
since the EgyptAir crash represents a startling change.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, his predecessor, James K. Kallstrom, held daily
briefings with the safety board after the TWA crash and became a
familiar public figure. Schiliro, on the other hand, has appeared
at only two briefings this time around, even though his New York
office is heading the criminal end of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, that low profile is characteristic of Schiliro,
although he has granted interviews to reporters about the crash.
</P>
<P>
   But Schiliro, a 24-year FBI veteran who has led some of the
bureau's most successful investigations into organized crime,
terrorism and public corruption, says he believes the need to offer
a public face is not as essential this time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, there was great apprehension about terrorism in New
York, and hundreds of witnesses claimed they saw an explosion or
even a missile hit the TWA jet. There has been no evidence so far
that points to a criminal act being behind the crash of EgyptAir
Flight 990.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're trying to do is to deal in facts,'' Schiliro said
Monday, ``and come to a justified conclusion based on those facts,
as opposed to speculation and having to provide theories.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro, 50, joined the bureau in 1975 and made a name for
himself investigating organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash of TWA Flight 800 in July 1996, Schiliro spent
nearly a month in Moriches, on Long Island, overseeing the effort
to recover and identify bodies and airplane wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking over the New York office in January 1998, Schiliro
has directed the bureau's investigation of the embassy bombings in
East Africa, allegations of Russian money laundering through the
Bank of New York, and recent charges of corruption by food
inspectors in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro said the experience of the TWA investigation had
ultimately made for a ``much quicker response'' in the EgyptAir
crash in ``knowing what to look for.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his agents and the safety board had been working closely
and without problems.
</P>
<P>
   Safety board officials have likewise praised the bureau's role
in the EgyptAir investigation. ``I would say they're not intrusive
at all,'' Greg Phillips, the investigator in charge, said at one
briefing. ``I couldn't be happier with the participation and
support we're getting right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the sense that the safety board has dominated the public
face of the investigation has spurred some debate. FBI agents have
appeared only sporadically at the safety board's daily briefings on
the crash, and once, it was reported last week, the chairman of the
transportation safety board, James E. Hall, asked two bureau
officials to stay away from the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Kallstrom, who is now in the banking industry, said that he was
concerned when he learned that the agents had been excluded. ``That
was just amateur night at best,'' Kallstrom said. ``I thought it
was inappropriate and highly political.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, who has said the bureau
hurt the safety board's investigation of the 1996 crash, said that
Hall's exclusion of the officials showed ``that the FBI has gotten
the message that they're going to be in an advisory role, and
helpful role to the NTSB.''
</P>
<P>
   Schiliro strongly defended the bureau's work in the TWA
investigation. He said that given the swirl of speculation, there
was a need for Kallstrom to ``stand up there and try to provide
some answers.''
</P>
<P>
   And although Schiliro has willingly given newspaper and
television interviews, he said his primary role would not be a
public one for now, but would continue to be the pursuit of the
answers the FBI is searching for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have the answers,'' he said. ``I don't know why the
plane went down.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his long, puritanical career as a dressmaker,
Cristobal Balenciaga never gave an interview and seldom saw a
client. He was a recluse deluxe, driving to work in his blue
Jaguar, dining with his friend Coco Chanel, visiting his homes in
his native Spain, but always comfortably cloistered. When a client
asked if she might bring a friend to see his show, one of the
couturier's minions replied, ``Curious women are not welcome
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Balenciaga's clothes were as serious as his customers were
devoted, and when he abruptly closed his fashion house in 1968, it
came as a blow to their elegant lives. Countess Mona Bismark was
said to have been so distraught she took to her room and didn't
emerge for three days. Balenciaga retired to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   In the only interview he gave in his life, he compared his last
years of dressing the world's rich and jet-propelled, who included
Barbara Hutton and the Duchess of Windsor, to ``a dog's life.'' He
died in 1972, just as the man who would eventually revive his label
was beginning to waddle in diapers.
</P>
<P>
   Nicolas Ghesquiere would seem to have nothing in common with the
man Christian Dior once called ``the master of us all.'' The second
child of a French mother and a Belgian father who tends golf
courses, Ghesquiere grew up in central France, where, among other
things, he developed a fascination for ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Balenciaga, at 13, was making clothes for the Marquese de Casa
Torres. At 25, he had his own couture house.
</P>
<P>
   Ghesquiere, 28, began his career working as an assistant to Jean
Paul Gaultier, then as a knitwear designer. When he was hired by
Groupe Jacques Bogart, the owner of Balenciaga, a French perfume
and ready-to-wear company that bought the brand in 1986 from the
German chemical giant Hoechst, Ghesquiere was designing uniforms
and funeral clothes under a Balenciaga license for Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to Balenciaga from what many people would say is the
worst position in fashion,'' he said last week during a visit to
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in just two seasons, Ghesquiere has emerged as a kind of
cult designer, a favorite with stylists like George Cortina, who
does John Bartlett's shows, as well as the actress Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good, the clothes are interesting and you want to wear
them,'' said Julie Gilhart, a vice president for women's fashion at
Barneys, which substantially increased its order for next spring.
``It's the same feeling I had when Prada and Helmut Lang were
starting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Annie O'Hayon, a press agent in the music business, bought a
pair of Ghesquiere's trousers at Jeffrey, which was one of the
first American retailers to carry the label. She said: ``At first,
what attracted me was the Balenciaga name. It really has an
emotional connection. At home, I always heard about Balenciaga and
Schiaparelli. But what I really care about is the fit, and the fact
that everybody's not buying it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   What's particularly intriguing about Ghesquiere's clothes is the
way he subtly incorporates references from Balenciaga's styles of
the 1940s and '50s. Nothing is a copy. That would be absurd,
because, for one thing, Balenciaga worked in haute couture, often
sewing a garment himself. And for another, Ghesquiere isn't
interested in trying to revive the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at all these images, and I learn and try to integrate
them, but then I try to forget them,'' he said. ``After all, I am
28 and I can only see things through my eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   But the references are there. They can be seen in the full
sleeves and V-neck tops, the wide shoulders and crinkled Gypsy
skirts, all of which draw on Balenciaga's original style, with its
heavy Spanish and Edwardian influence. Leather sleeves, crushed
tightly above the elbows, evoke a Balenciaga coat with plush,
rippling sleeves.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Ghesquiere's last two collections, which were
presented with a cold severity (another Balenciaga idea), some
fashion writers innocently noted that the clothes looked Edwardian.
One reviewer said of Ghesquiere's spring 2000 collection that it
``was so low key it had virtually no impact at all.'' In 1951, when
Balenciaga deviated from Dior's New Look with the first semifitted
suit, hardly anyone, with the exception of Carmel Snow, the editor
of Harper's Bazaar, saw that he was creating the beginnings of the
modern suit.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, these references point up what a visionary
Balenciaga was.
</P>
<P>
   After Ghesquiere's spring collection last year, with its
high-neck collars evocative of Princess Leia in ``Star Wars,'' a
number of reviewers said it had overtones of the late 1970s. But as
Ghesquiere said, ``I found in that same era the results of
Balenciaga's work, from the '40s and '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, with a laugh, ``You can open a Balenciaga book and see
the religious clothes, the references to the paintings of Goya, and
you can look at `Star Wars' and see almost the same thing. And
`Star Wars' is supposed to be the future.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the drawback, critics say, with Ghesquiere's
clothes. Are they too referential?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm wondering if he's holding back,'' said Linda Dresner, who
bought the current fall collection for her stores in New York City
and in Birmingham, Mich., but passed on next spring's line. ``I
just don't see enough of his personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Burstein, who owns Browns in London, expressed similar
doubts. ``Collections such as Michael Kors, Marc Jacobs and Celine
are doing very well for us, as they are more forward-looking and
have inspired vision,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reviving Balenciaga may just be an overwhelming task.
Marie-Andree Jouve, who oversees the Balenciaga archive in Paris
and who is co-author of a primary reference book on the designer,
conceded that Ghesquiere has ``the spirit of Balenciaga.'' But she
emitted the tiniest Gallic wince when it was suggested that he, or
anyone, could successfully follow Balenciaga.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no,'' she said. ``It's impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but Jacques Konckier, the manager director of the company
that owns the Balenciaga trademark and perfume, said that in the
two and a half years since Ghesquiere took over the collection from
Josephus Thimister, who mainly designed evening clothes, sales had
doubled, to around $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicolas is translating Balenciaga in a very modern way, and he
was right to rehabilitate the house in terms of day wear,''
Konckier said, adding that they are discussing lines of shoes and
handbags.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Ghesquiere doesn't seem the kind of guy to get weepy
with reverence. He grew animated when discussing a film Balenciaga
made in the early '60s, when, in a pique, he put on a show in a
room of empty chairs. No clients, no music, only the clickety whir
of an 8-millimeter camera. But that is just a cool thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say this,'' Ghesquiere said, smiling. ``I have no
Balenciaga complex.''

MRS. CLINTON SAYS TRIP TO ISRAEL IS UNRELATED TO NEW YORK RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Monday that her trip
this week to Israel was an official visit and should not be viewed
in the context of her run for the U.S. Senate. Her remarks came as
the White House disclosed more details of the first lady's 36-hour
itinerary, including a visit to the Western Wall in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an official trip,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``That is
something very important to stress. I was invited last spring as
first lady. I'm going as first lady. It is a totally official trip
and I hope it does not have any political questions associated with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Mrs. Clinton prepared to leave on Mondayevening for a trip
that will take her to both Israel and Jordan, it was clear that her
visit is to some extent becoming tangled in the often-overlapping
politics of Jerusalem and New York.
</P>
<P>
   At City Hall, Mayor Ehud Olmert of Jerusalem, a member of the
conservative Likud Party and a friend of Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of
New York City, assailed Mrs. Clinton, he said, for not including
any visits to East Jerusalem on her itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very, very sad for the fact that she chose not to visit
the East Side of Jerusalem, which appears to me like a political
statement, which is in somewhat contradiction to her original
statement that she supports the transfer of the American Embassy to
Jerusalem and the unity of the city as our capital,'' Olmert said.
</P>
<P>
   Olmert said he was not taking sides in an American political
race _ Giuliani is the likely Republican candidate in the race for
Senate _ but he offered warm words for Giuliani during their jovial
joint appearance outside Giuliani's office. It came less than 24
hours before Mrs. Clinton was scheduled to leave on a trip to a
country that has historically been a standard visit for any New
York candidate running for office.
</P>
<P>
   Olmert's remarks came after Israeli newspapers reported that
Mrs. Clinton had decided against visiting the Western Wall in
Jerusalem, and some American Jewish leaders had criticized her for
that. In truth, over the last week, Mrs. Clinton and her aides said
that most of the details of the trip _ other than two speeches she
was giving _ had not been worked out and that she might visit the
Western Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Early Monday afternoon, Mrs. Clinton said that her schedule had
not been set but that ``obviously, I'm going to try to go; I've
been there twice before.'' Later in the day, Mrs. Clinton's White
House spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said the visit to the Western Wall
in Jerusalem and a visit to a children's center in Tel Aviv had
been added to the schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Olmert's criticisms about the first lady's not going
to East Jerusalem, Ms. Berry responded: ``No, he's wrong. She is
going to visit East Jerusalem. She's going to the Wailing Wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berry said that additional stops might be scheduled for Mrs.
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's two main public events are to be a speech to a
children's conference at Tel Aviv University and an address at the
Rabin Center. She is also attending a dinner with Prime Minister
Ehud Barak. From Israel, she will go to Jordan for two days before
joining President Clinton in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton said her visit to Israel had become complicated
because it had been reduced from four days, when she first began
planning it last spring, to just over a day. She delayed her last
trip because Barak had just won an election and was in the process
of forming a government.

ARIZONA'S 12 `GENIUSES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BEVERLY MEDLYN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - They ponder fly brains and desert seeds, sexual
reproduction and forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   One has worked 25 years creating art inside a dormant volcano
near Flagstaff. Another is building devices that can detect life on
other planets.
</P>
<P>
   A third is organizing Arizona ranchers to protect open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   They're among the 12 Arizona recipients of the MacArthur
Foundation's so-called ``genius grants'' _ each given thousands of
dollars to spend as they wish.
</P>
<P>
   No strings. No reports. No questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   Though Arizona's 12 differ in many ways, they share two things:
</P>
<P>
   First, all scoff at the ``genius'' label.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even tie my shoe or remember my license number,''
wildlife researcher Marvin ``Phil'' Kahl said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, each remembers that phone call out of the blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hair on the back of my neck stood up,'' Native American
writer Leslie Marmon Silko said.
</P>
<P>
   Plant ethnobiologist Gary Nabhan: ``I went into shock,
literally.''
</P>
<P>
   The grants _ described by foundation officials as ``venture
capital for intellectual, social and artistic endeavors'' _ ranged
from $176,000 to $330,000. They are dispensed quarterly over a
five-year period.
</P>
<P>
   They are unique in that no one can apply, and no one must
account for how he or she spends the money.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Socolow, director of the program, said the grant ``is a
vote of confidence in (recipients') potential, not an award for
what they have done.''
</P>
<P>
   The recipients, he said, ``are those who have risen to the
challenge of not doing things in the same way, not getting stuck in
categories that so many of us get stuck in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are maverick and extraordinary,'' he said, ``approaching
whatever field they are in with a fresh, different and challenging
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   The approach is eased by free money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real godsend,'' Silko recalled. ``I was a single
mother. I was teaching. I had a long novel in mind, and I didn't
have the money to devote myself to it. All of a sudden, there it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   The fellowship enabled Silko to produce the 742-page Almanac of
the Dead.
</P>
<P>
   Silko, of Tucson, was among the first group of fellows ever
named in 1981. University of Arizona linguistics professor Ofelia
Zepeda is the most recent winner, named in June. They are among 563
fellows nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Arizona's 12 relied on the annual stipends as their sole
support while they wrote books or pursued research projects.
</P>
<P>
   Others _ mainly scientists _ are so awash in grants that even
$60,000 a year is a comparative drop in the bucket.
</P>
<P>
   Socolow said the foundation doesn't care where the money goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone were to put an addition on their house to have
their parents live with them, and take that worry off their head,
that could be great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If buying a car relieves them of other anxieties and stresses
in their lives, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects even span generations. Kahl said his $320,000 award
prompted his mother, then 83, to go car shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew I wouldn't need the money for an inheritance,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kahl, who supported 30 years of water-bird and elephant research
by selling wildlife photos, socked away a chunk of the MacArthur
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came for five years,'' he said, ``but will last for 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Cultural anthropologist Brackette Williams, the daughter of
migrant laborers based in southern Arizona, was notified of her
$285,000 fellowship two years ago as she was leaving a visiting
professorship at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I will go back to the academic world,'' said
Williams, who lives in Tucson. ``In my heart of hearts, I am just a
cowgirl.''
</P>
<P>
   But the exhilaration of economic freedom sometimes carries a
price.
</P>
<P>
   Nabhan, currently director of science and conservation at the
Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum, was so overwhelmed during the first
year of his $245,000 MacArthur award that he developed chronic
fatigue syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so honored by the award that I said yes to anything
people threw in front of me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about it that is more complex than just
being a blessing. You feel: `I've been given this tremendous gift.
I have to help other people.'
</P>
<P>
   ``You can easily burn yourself out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabhan said, ``I had been conserving pennies to make it through
the year. When I went into Tucson the next day for the press
conference, my lights went out in the car because I hadn't been
able to pay to fix an electrical problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabhan wrote five books over the five-year period, including The
Geography of Childhood, which helps teachers put children in touch
with the natural world. He also crafted a native-food diet to help
diabetes-prone Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fellowship made me feel more comfortable with who I am,''
he said. ``It was always hard to justify to the scientists that I
was a writer, and hard to explain to writers that I cared about all
this technical stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The cross-disciplinary dexterity is not unusual for MacArthur
fellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't keep their crayons in the box,'' Socolow said.
``The unusual, highly creative person is someone who will define
things differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``In academe, they often are people who don't fit naturally or
don't feel comfortable in any one place.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of Arizona has five of the 12 fellows; Arizona
State University has one, Stephen Pyne.
</P>
<P>
   Pyne is a professor of history and biology _ an odd combination
for anyone but a MacArthur fellow. Among the world's foremost
experts on fire, Pyne was given $250,000 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Also a Fulbright fellow, Pyne has produced a suite of
environmental histories, Cycle of Fire. He served 18 seasons as a
firefighter with the National Park Service. That experience
inspired him to write his current book, How the Grand Canyon Became
Grand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm back to the old conundrum of not really fitting in,''
Pyne said. He'd like to go to Africa or Canada to study fire, but
hasn't yet found a funding source.
</P>
<P>
   For MacArthur fellows in the hard sciences, the fellowship is
but one of many flowing to them and their departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tendency to self-breed _ one grant encourages more
grants,'' said Nicholas Strausfeld, a MacArthur winner and UA
professor of neurobiology. He's known as ``flybrain'' in his e-mail
address, denoting his expertise in insect anatomy.
</P>
<P>
   But not all MacArthur fellows have academic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   William McDonald is a fifth-generation cattle rancher in
Douglas. Last year, he got a $285,000 fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald assembled the Malpai Borderlands Group, a unique blend
of ranchers, conservationists and scientists devoted to preserving
open space and protecting endangered species on their land.
</P>
<P>
   ``This award has given us recognition we wouldn't have gotten
otherwise,'' McDonald said. ``The money itself has given me a
breather. But I'm not doing anything any differently than I would
have done anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Do Arizona's 12 fellows consider themselves geniuses?
</P>
<P>
   To a one, the answer is no. The media came up with that term,
they note, not the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just fanatic about what I do,'' Kahl said. ``That is the
common thread among these people: They are crazy about what they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald said his gift lies in cutting to the chase ``to what
needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that talent, he has no special claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a lucky son of a gun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   UA astronomy Professor Roger Angel said said he reserves the
term ``genius'' for ``Newton, Einstein and Mozart _ people who work
on a plane many levels beyond me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, everyone can hope for a moment of genius.
</P>
<P>
   For Angel, that came when he discovered that hydrogen atoms in
the presence of a strong magnetic field caused features in a
certain type of star.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you recognize you're the only person who knows that
thing, there are incredible highs to be had,'' Angel said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly the point, Socolow said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program has two real goals,'' he said. ``One is to seed
and nurture individual creativity, and the other is to demonstrate
that it is everywhere around us.'' &QL;

THE CIVIC VALUE OF STATIC CLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - For more than a week, the most pow erful politicians in
the state of Ari zona were consumed completely by a sometimes
bitter, often accusatory, al ways boisterous argument over hair
curl ers. Or, perhaps, curling irons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Depending upon whom you believe.
</P>
<P>
   It began when the state's speaker of the House, Jeff Groscost,
repeated what he thought was a funny story to a reporter from USA
Today. Groscost talked about being on a road trip with Gov. Jane
Hull, Secretary of State Betsey Bayless and state Senate President
Brenda Burns, in which he listened to the women debate the pros and
cons of 2-inch and quarter-inch curlers.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today sent a writer to Arizona to report on how the state's
top five elected positions are held by women. The front-page
article with Groscost's anec dote was printed on a Friday, Oct.
29th.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Hull told an audience of 2,000 professional women
that she would ``send a pointed message to the speaker . . . to
remind him we don't talk about curlers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about issues, and we talk about what's good for the
state of Ari zona,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's press secretary called it ``a chauvinistic
remark,'' adding, ``(We) are disappointed that the speaker had the
opportunity to showcase the state to the national media and,
instead, made a wise crack that was not true.''
</P>
<P>
   With his veracity in question, Groscost found someone to back up
his story. Early the following week, he trotted out state Rep. Lori
Daniels, the House majority leader, who said she was on the trip,
too, and remembered the women discussing hair care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about the size of our curling irons and
driving him crazy,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth the officials went, split ting hairs, stirring up
the kind of free wheeling public debate that hasn't existed in
America since we pondered the ques tion:
</P>
<P>
   ``Does she or doesn't she?''
</P>
<P>
   A COLLECTIVE `NOOOOOO!'
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, when the quarrel ling ended and the
politicians put aside their juvenile carping and promised to de
vote their time and energy to government, it was as if everyone in
the state took a deep breath and let out a collective ``Noooooo!''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that when politicos are busy getting into each
other's hair, they can't get into ours.
</P>
<P>
   So, if our top officials don't want to talk about curlers
anymore, how about lip gloss? Or dishpan hands?
</P>
<P>
   Why bother with taxation, transporta tion or education, when
we've yet to eliminate ring around the collar?
</P>
<P>
   And what about recipes?
</P>
<P>
   As they used to tell us on TV, ``Nothin' says lovin' like
somethin' from the oven.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Groscost told USA Today, ``I finally understood what
ladies have long talked about: having to endure men's talk about
football and basketball games.''
</P>
<P>
   He should run with that thought.
</P>
<P>
   And if he and fellow members of the state House run out of
football and bas ketball stories, they could move on to baseball
and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer. Auto racing. Fly-fishing. La crosse.
</P>
<P>
   Or go full circle, to curling. The ``sport.'' The only
competition in the Olympics featuring ice, a stone and a couple of
guys with brooms.
</P>
<P>
   WELCOME DISTRACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   If recent weeks have taught us any thing, it's that politicians
cannot simulta neously pull on each other's pompadours and pick our
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   On a national level, the impeachment of President Clinton served
the same pur pose, protecting the public from politi cians for the
better part of a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dragging the country into that kind of toilet,
however, why not fol low Arizona's model and discuss, say, drain
cleaners? Or static cling?
</P>
<P>
   The women running Arizona proved they can be as small-minded as
any man. With your encouragement, they'll sink to even greater
depths. It won't be easy. And should they ever claim to run out
trivial subjects to argue about, remember:
</P>

ANOTHER BRUIN FALLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA's cursed season continued Monday when coach
Bob Toledo announced starting center Troy Danoff has suffered a
season-ending knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Danoff, a sophomore, tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his
left knee Wednesday in a routine blocking drill. It was the second
season-ending injury of the bye week: A day earlier, guard Mike
Saffer sprained his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``What more can happen?'' Toledo said. ``It's devastating
because (Danoff) will miss spring practice, which he greatly needs,
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Without Danoff, Saffer and reserve center Tony Ippolito (knee
surgery), the Bruins have eight healthy offensive linemen. One,
reserve guard Ed Anderson, has spent most of the season on the
scout team.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, right tackle Brian Polak has moved to right guard.
Reserve guard Matt Phelan will start at center. Left tackle Blake
Worley might start at right tackle _ if true freshman Bryce
Bohlander plays well on the left side _ and Jim Ghezzi is the
backup at three positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all this adversity, we just have to show what kind of
character we have, because we can't change the cards,'' Polak said.
``But I absolutely think this will benefit us next year, because
we've all been through it together.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Full circle: The move to center means Phelan, a senior from
Leona Valley, will start at his third position this year. He opened
the season at left guard because of Oscar Cabrera's suspension,
then he moved to to right guard when Saffer missed several games
because of a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center is actually my favorite position,'' Phelan said. ``It's
more cerebral. You have to recognize blocking schemes and call out
the fronts. It's ironic that I started my career there (as a
freshman) and through dumb luck I'm ending it there.''
</P>
<P>
   __ There's more: Toledo said tight end Bryan Fletcher and
defensive tackle Ken Kocher probably won't play Saturday against
Washington. Both have severely sprained ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Their absence means seven expected starters are missing from
UCLA's lineup: cornerbacks Marques Anderson (suspension) and Jason
Bell (heel), receiver Brian Poli-Dixon (broken wrist), Fletcher,
Kocher, Saffer and Danoff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, five second-stringers are out: defensive end Travor
Turner (knee), left tackle Josh Webb (shoulder), linebacker Asi
Faoa (back), linebacker Ed Stansbury (knee) and Ippolito.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing a lot of key players,'' Toledo said, ``and we're
losing players in positions we can't afford to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   The offensive-line injuries are especially damaging, since
UCLA's running game has fueled its eight-game winning streak over
USC.
</P>
<P>
   __ Revving up: As the line falls apart, the playmakers return.
Tailback DeShaun Foster, who had five carries in October because of
a sprained ankle, and receiver Danny Farmer, who has played
sparingly in recent weeks because of a strained groin, are ready
for full-time duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're as healthy as they've been all year, but they won't be
at full speed,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ And finally: The UCLA-USC game Nov. 20 at the Coliseum will
start at 12:30 p.m. and be televised on Channel 7.

IGNORING CURRICULUM LED TO POOR SCORES, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When New York state announced the poor results of its
tough new fourth- and eighth-grade math tests on Friday, the dismay
was not confined, as so often in the past, to New York City and
other big cities. Many parents, teachers and administrators in the
state's wealthiest areas _ where people buy expensive homes
thinking that they are also buying outstanding public schools _
were in shock, too.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, residents there had been lulled into complacency
because the state had used a minimum competency test to measure
student performance, a test on which children in places like
Westchester County and Long Island routinely scored near 100
percent _ so high that there was no statistical room for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   That complacency was rudely shattered last week when one out of
five children in even the most exclusive suburbs, like Rye, Great
Neck and Mamaroneck, failed to meet state standards in eighth-grade
math.
</P>
<P>
   Parents throughout the state wondered what had gone wrong. Was
the test asking the wrong questions, or were schools failing to
teach what children should know?
</P>
<P>
   From Syracuse to New York City, educators said Monday that they
believed the test itself was not to blame. State officials said
that the creators of the new test, far from expecting children to
demonstrate an unprecedented level of knowledge, actually based it
on elements of the state curriculum that had been in place for over
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, they said, was that _ especially in the middle
grades _ those standards had never been tested. And since no one
was watching, officials said, teachers felt free to ignore the
state curriculum, relying on inadequate textbooks or their own
judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't surprised,'' State Education Commissioner Richard
Mills, who pushed the state Board of Regents to adopt the new
tests, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Rizzo, deputy chancellor for instruction in New York
City, where 77 percent of eighth-graders failed to meet the new
math standards, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know everybody wants to blame the test,'' she said. ``But
you can't. There's nothing wrong with this test. It's that it
measures standards that, across the state, people have not been
preparing kids for. And it's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Stung as they were by the dismal results, some education
officials said the test revealed problems in eighth-grade math
classes _ including shortages of qualified teachers, early tracking
of students and a focus on rote learning rather than understanding
_ that pervades middle schools across the United States, not just
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of testing in middle school also explains why
fourth-graders did better than eighth-graders on the new test, said
Lynn Richbart, a mathematics specialist for the state Education
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, Richbart said, the state has tested heavily in third
through sixth grade _ forcing teachers to focus on state standards.
But this is the first year that eighth-graders have been required
to take math tests, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new tests are in many ways a reaction to the freedom,
experimentation and idiosyncratic curriculums that came to
characterize American schools in the last generation, educators
said. In New York City, curricular unorthodoxy was heightened by
decentralization.
</P>
<P>
   The tests, given during the last school year, grew out of a
broader re-examination of how students across the nation were being
taught math. In 1989, state officials said, the National Council of
Mathematics recommended new math standards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, New York state, influenced by the council, toughened
its own math standards. Five years later, seeing a need to make
those standards more concrete, the state put out a new math
curriculum for kindergarten through eighth grade. These were the
standards used for the latest tests.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the results are out, the next step, Mills said, is to
use those results as a force to improve the curriculum and
teaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a pop quiz,'' Mills, the education commissioner,
said. ``We had standards, curriculum, test results. If you don't
like the results, what do you do? First of all you look at what is
actually taught in every school in every classroom.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Echoing Mills, several math teachers said Monday that the
concepts used in the eighth-grade test are not particularly
difficult and that the problem was that they had too often been
taught by rote, or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Many elementary school teachers, they said, suffer from a kind
of math phobia, often resulting from lack of training, that limits
them to teaching simple calculation and formulas, without being
able to give students a richer understanding of the abstract
concepts that the calculations are based on.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Davis, a math teacher in New York City, said that he
began the last school year by trying to teach algebra to
ninth-graders at Bayard Rustin High School for Humanities in
Manhattan. As they asked questions, he said, it became clear that
many of them did not know how to multiply two double-digit numbers,
and he had to start over.
</P>
<P>
   Mills said he had little patience with the argument that
disadvantaged children could not be held to the same standards as
more affluent ones who came to school with more learning from home.
In the job market, he said, they would all face the same demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't say before we have this job interview, would you
please tell me did you come from a good school or a bad school, an
advantaged community or a disadvantaged community?'' he said.

POLITICS CHILLS FORBES-WHITMAN FRIENDSHIP OF MANY YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Steve Forbes brought his Republican presidential
campaign into New Jersey's capital on Monday, speaking on the steps
of a war memorial a block from the office of his childhood pal,
Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman made her own public appearance in a Revolutionary War
barracks just a few hundred yards away. But Forbes and the governor
did not visit with each other or speak during his daylong stop in
Trenton, and that conspicuous silence was a stark reminder that
their friendship of nearly a half century has become a casualty in
the battle between the various factions of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Once schoolmates, political allies and young Republican
bluebloods in New Jersey's hunt country, Forbes and Whitman now
find themselves on opposing sides of the Republican Party divide.
They attended Far Hills Country Day School in Somerset County
together, were raised in prominent and politically active
Republican families in affluent Somerset County and grew up in
estates about 10 minutes apart.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who has been vilified by her party's right wing for her
support of abortion rights, has publicly criticized Forbes' shift
on social issues several times this year, accusing him of caving in
to the conservative voters who dominate the party's primaries.
</P>
<P>
   When the governor said Monday during a conversation with
reporters that she had not followed the primary campaign closely
and then offered a few kind words for Forbes, she was asked whether
she knew that campaign aides for her longtime friend had been
trying to win votes by bluntly portraying him as the anti-Whitman.
Her expression made it clear that she was hardly heartened by the
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve was certainly a Christie Whitman Republican when I first
ran for governor,'' Whitman said with a smile, ``and I haven't
changed on the issues that were important to me then and are
important to me now. If he's changed, that's up to him. And that's
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes came to Trenton to rally social conservatives supporting
a proposal to make every student in New Jersey begin the school day
by reciting part of the Declaration of Independence in addition to
the Pledge of Allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   He also took the occasion to brush aside any suggestion that he
might abandon his presidential bid and seek the party's nomination
for U.S. Senate next year. That race has been in turmoil since
Whitman dropped out of contention in September. Chuck Haytaian,
chairman of the state Republican Party, said he had no indication
that Forbes might be interested in the Senate race if his
presidential bid is unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's running for the presidency. He still thinks he has a
shot,'' Haytaian said. ``Think about it. He spent $37 million to
run for president last time He's spent $15 million this time. After
all that, why would he back away to run for the Senate?''
</P>
<P>
   Other than their background and party affiliation, Forbes and
Whitman have little in common these days. She will complete her
second and final term as governor next year, and has traveled the
country trying to raise money and support for Republican moderates.
Forbes, meanwhile, has spent much of the last four years courting
conservatives, occasionally at the expense of Whitman.
</P>
<P>
   A former Republican governor, Tom Kean, who has known both
Forbes and Whitman for decades, said it was inevitable that they
would go their separate ways once Forbes acted on his ambitions for
national office.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the national stage, there's only room for one person from
New Jersey,'' Kean said. ``There's a rivalry that develops, quite
naturally. So there's a certain wariness among supporters and
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of many New Jersey Republicans, young Christie and
Steve were indelibly linked at the Republican presidential
convention in 1956, which nominated Dwight Eisenhower to a second
term in the White House. Christie Todd, age 9, and Steve Forbes,
age 8, appeared on stage together to present ceremonial gifts to
the children of the renominated vice president, Richard Nixon.

IT LOOKS AS IF PALMER WON'T BE BACK UNTIL 2000
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Official word could come as early as tonight that
injured USC quarterback Carson Palmer will not return this season.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer, who broke his collarbone in September, is scheduled to
be examined by team doctors after today's practice. Even if he is
allowed to begin upper-body exercises this week, he would probably
not have enough time to get in shape and begin throwing to be
available for the Nov. 20 UCLA game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put him in a position where he overcompensates
and hurts himself,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also have little desire to bring Palmer back and
burn his redshirt year just to play in the final two games of the
season. If Palmer redshirts, he would have three years of
eligibility remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he gets hurt again, he'll have that extra year left,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Howard commits: Banning High tailback Chris Howard orally
committed to USC on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Howard rushed for 2,495 yards and 33 touchdowns last season.
This season, he rushed for 1,147 yards and 12 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think USC's getting the best running back in the state,''
Banning coach Ed Lalau said.
</P>
<P>
   USC now has eight commitments.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fox expected to start: Hackett said he is leaning toward
starting John Fox against Washington State, with Mike Van Raaphorst
the backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion is with repetitions, John will continue to
improve,'' Hackett said. ``He did some good things. He just made
one bad throw.''
</P>
<P>
   In a slight difference, Hackett said Fox's performance could
determine how much time he plays against the Cougars. Last week, he
said Van Raaphorst would share playing time with Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll do that the next time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett also said he did not second-guess himself for removing
Fox in the second half and playing Van Raaphorst.
</P>
<P>
   ``In looking at the tape. . . . Mike gave us a lift,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Defending Newbury: After viewing the tape, Hackett said
kicker David Newbury was not completely responsible for his missed
field goal and missed extra point.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the missed field goal, there was a lot of pressure on the
left side of the line, and the snap rolled back on the extra
point,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ USC-UCLA game time: The USC-UCLA game at the Coliseum will
kickoff at 12:30 p.m. and be televised on Channel 7 (ABC-TV). The
game is a near-sellout with fewer than 1,000 tickets remaining.
</P>
<P>
   __ Pass happy: USC is on pace to set a school record for passes
attempted in a season. The Trojans are averaging 40 passes a game,
above the school record of 36.6 attempts per game in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   USC has averaged 46 passes during its five-game losing streak
and only 24 rushing attempts. Despite that lopsided ratio, the
Trojans have passed 52 percent of its plays and run 48 percent this
season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Late game: This is the latest USC has faced Washington State
since 1935, when the game was Nov. 16, and the latest meeting the
teams have ever had in Pullman, Wash.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard Martin, who infused the Costume Institute of
the Metropolitan Museum of Art with his deep knowledge of popular
culture and art history, died Monday at his apartment in New York.
He was 52.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was melanoma, said Dr. Richard Slusarczyk, his
companion.
</P>
<P>
   Martin had been the curator of the Met's costume collection
since 1993. Since coming to the Met from the Fashion Institute of
Technology, he had presented such exhibitions as ``Cubism and
Fashion,'' ``Gianni Versace,'' ``Christian Dior,'' ``American
Ingenuity: Sportswear, 1930s-1970s,'' ``Orientalism: Visions of the
East in Western Dress,'' ``Madame Gres'' and ``Swords Into
Ploughshares: Military Dress and the Civilian Wardrobe.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin also organized an exhibition with the unlikely name of
``Wordrobe,'' a historical look at clothing adorned with words,
from poems to political slogans. He described it as ``the
reconciliation of textile and text.''
</P>
<P>
   An April 1998 exhibition, ``The Ceaseless Century: 300 Years of
18th-Century Costume,'' was called scintillating in a review by
Grace Glueck in The New York Times. ``Too often,'' she wrote,
``historical costume shows are yawny dissertations on, well, the
history of clothes. Not this one. The clothes may be overwrought,
but there's real panache to the presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Martin's exhibitions at the Met disappointed fashion
critics because they weren't as showy as those he had been involved
with at the Fashion Institute of Technology or as flamboyant as
those mounted by his predecessor at the Met, Diana Vreeland.
</P>
<P>
   But he was constrained because the space allotted to the Costume
Institute had shrunk after Mrs. Vreeland's tenure and because he
was obliged to display everything behind glass rather than in the
round. (That had been the custom at the fashion institute and at
the Met under Mrs. Vreeland.) On the other hand, he brought a more
scholarly approach to the subject of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard's major contribution to costume studies was his
ability to input vigor and academic interest from his art history
background,'' said Harold Koda, his associate curator for almost 20
years. ``He saw fashion design as a manifestation that had richness
of content that could be analyzed the way an art object was
analyzed. He didn't see any kind of contradiction in that. Costume
exhibitions were transformed because of his work.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin also added to the Costume Institute's collection by
accepting donations of clothing from designers and their clients
and by shopping at auctions, flea markets, discount stores and
Barneys New York's warehouse sales.
</P>
<P>
   In April he told The Times about buying a John Galliano dress at
Century 21, the discount store. ``Absolutely off the rack,'' he
said. ``In fact, falling off the rack.'' The dress was later
displayed in the Met show ``Our New Clothes: Acquisitions of the
1990s.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's involvement with fashion exhibitions began in 1980 at
the Fashion Institute of Technology, where he worked with Koda and
Laura Sinderbrand, the director of the school's Design Laboratory,
now called the Museum at FIT.
</P>
<P>
   He had begun his career in New York in 1973, teaching art
history at FIT, at the School of Visual Arts and at New York
University. He served as the editor in chief of Arts Magazine
before being appointed the executive director of the Shirley
Goodman Resource Center, which is responsible for exhibitions and
collections at the fashion institute.
</P>
<P>
   Among the landmark exhibitions the three mounted at FIT were
``The East Village,'' ``Fashion and Surrealism,'' ``Undercover
Story'' and ``Three Women: Madeleine Vionnet, Claire McCardell, Rei
Kawakubo.'' Their work earned them a special award in 1987 from the
Council of Fashion Designers of America. In 1996 while at the Met,
Martin won another award from the council, ``for furthering fashion
in art and culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ```East Village' was the best example of what Richard did so
well,'' Ms. Sinderbrand said. ``There was a wall of painting,
sculpture, music and the club scene. It was avant-garde and off the
57th Street-Madison Avenue scene. We showed work produced by young
people in the East Village. To eat, they had to produce wearable
art because they couldn't exist on fine art alone. Many produced
clothing and jewelry that was outrageous and wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   In a review of ``The East Village'' in Time magazine, Jay Cocks
called it ``an eye-scalding, rambunctious and appropriately
free-spirited tour of boho fashion, Manhattan style.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the ideas for the exhibitions at both the fashion
institute and the Met originated with Martin, said Koda, who left
the Met in 1997 to study landscape architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``His interests were so vast,'' Koda said. ``We did five or six
shows a year at FIT and three a year at the Met, while most museums
do only one. And he always had three or four years' worth of ideas.
Some fashion people had difficulty with his language, because his
language was the language of art, not fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   An example of his literary style can be gleaned from notes
accompanying ``The Ceaseless Century: 300 Years of 18th-Century
Costume,'' shown in 1998 at the Met. Martin observed, ``Display was
far more important than the body it sought to cover and
ameliorate.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 article in The New York Times about cutting-edge
fashion, Martin was quoted as saying that art and fashion often
faced the same problem. ``It has become very difficult for anything
to retain its shock value for very long,'' he said. ``A commercial
art form like fashion almost immediately takes on those forms that
have any degree of transgression or shock about them. ''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Harrison Martin was born on Dec. 4, 1946, at Bryn Mawr,
Pa. He graduated from Swarthmore College in 1967 and received two
master's degrees, both from Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   He was a tireless lecturer and reviewer and held many academic
positions, including those at the School of Visual Arts, New York
University, Columbia University, the Juilliard School and Parsons
School of Design.
</P>
<P>
   Martin wrote more than 100 scholarly papers on subjects as
varied as ``Art History and the Assimilation of Images by
Contemporary Artists'' and ``Redress of the Nerds: The Assertion of
Nerd Style in Men's Clothing and Imagery in the 1980s.'' He also
wrote books on fashion and art, including ``Fashion and
Surrealism'' and ``Charles James,'' and was a co-author of others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Slusarczyk, Martin is survived by his brother,
Robert, of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sinderbrand, who knew Martin for two decades, said he rarely
talked about himself, but in a note to her after her retirement, he
expressed ambivalence about giving up teaching to go to the Met:
``I realize that I want and probably need to be effective and
expressive in some public way.''

TOLL RECORDS AID IN AUDIT OF PRISON WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ For nearly a year and a half, state authorities
say, dozens of prison employees spent their workdays tending to
personal affairs and then falsified time sheets to cover their
tracks. The scheme might never have been uncovered, the authorities
say, had the employees not committed one minor blunder: using their
state-issued E-ZPasses and cellular phones wherever they went.
</P>
<P>
   E-ZPasses, which are mounted on windshields, are read
electronically at toll gates, allowing the fares to be
automatically deducted from customers' accounts, and the location
of the transaction to be recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The trail of billing records generated from the E-ZPass and
cellular phone use allowed auditors for the state comptroller, Carl
McCall, to pinpoint where the state employees actually were at
various times when they said they were in their offices. Details of
the findings were in a report that McCall's office released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   McCall's auditors found that 38 employees for the state's
Department of Correctional Services collected $65,000 in pay for
hours they apparently did not work. The audit, conducted from April
1996 to August 1997, focused on investigators in the state agency's
offices here and in New York City. The investigators, among other
things, track down inmates who have escaped from prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, McCall said the abuses resulted from the
agency's failure to oversee and monitor the activities of its
investigators properly, noting that agency officials were warned of
similar problems in the past. He reserved his harshest words for
the agency's commissioner, Glenn Goord, saying Goord had done
nothing to correct the situation despite those warnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time and again over the last year and a half, we have reached
out to the commissioner and his Department of Correctional staff,
urging them to take corrective action, or to provide evidence that
these findings are wrong,'' McCall said. ``They have failed to do
either.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall's office referred the matter to officials at both the
attorney general's office and the inspector general's office, where
a criminal investigation can be opened.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the state agency dismissed the findings in
McCall's report. James Flateau, a spokesman for the agency, raised
questions about the methods McCall's auditors used. He said that
agency investigators often shared state-issued E-ZPasses, making it
difficult to determine who was using a given pass on any given day.
E-ZPass records, he said, ``track the E-Pass, not the person.''
</P>
<P>
   But Theresa Bourgeois, a spokeswoman for McCall, said auditors
were careful not to rely entirely on the E-ZPass records.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bourgeois said that auditors interviewed 20 of the 38
investigators who were the subject of the investigation and that
none of them said they had swapped E-ZPasses with their colleagues
as part of their explanations. In addition, she said, auditors
found that the billing records from E-ZPass accounts were generally
consistent with many of the notes the employees had written into
their daily logs.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors obtained E-ZPass records for a total of 2,806 days.
Overall, the auditors found 1,800 occasions in which the E-ZPass
records suggested that the prison employees were on the road when
their time sheets indicated that they were at work.

SEATTLE PREPARING FOR POTENTIAL TERRORISM DURING WTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Local hospitals are stockpiling antidotes against
biological and chemical weapons and putting their own
decontamination units in place in preparation for the World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Harborview Medical Center, like other downtown hospitals, has
warned its staff to be on the lookout for unusual clusters of
symptoms that would alert them to biological or chemical exposure
in time to intervene quickly and minimize potential damage. Most of
the hospitals will be doing dry-runs of their response plans in the
final week before the conference, which runs from Nov. 30 through
Dec. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to emphasize the likelihood of a (weapon of mass
destruction or bioterrorism) is really quite small, and we must
keep this in perspective,'' said Dr. Ron Dobson, chief of emergency
services at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle. ``But it is not
zero. The (attack on the) World Trade Center and the Oklahoma City
bombing have shown us that we are at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Public Health _ Seattle &AMP; King County, is asking physicians to
be especially aware of symptoms that might indicate an attack
involving anthrax, botulism, or smallpox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll be more acutely aware of a cluster of flu-like
symptoms,'' said Alonzo Plough, health department director.
``There's a possibility it could be related to an exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, hospitals are increasing their staffing to handle
everything from potential injuries from riots to chemical attacks,
said Dr. Michael Copass, director of Harborview's emergency
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to realize we're in a time and age when people no
longer keep their sadness at home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are tracking supplies of medications and antidotes
that would be useful to combat anthrax, smallpox, botulism, or
chemical agents, such as nerve gases, said Kim Baisch, manager of
emergency services for Virginia Mason Medical Center. The amounts
and locations of those medications will be reported to Harborview,
which would coordinate a response to such an attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medications will be available to treat those things,'' she
said. ``The supplies will be here in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   One medication hospitals are keeping close track of, for
example, is atropine, a drug used to combat damage from
neurotoxins, such as Sarin, the gas used in a 1995 Tokyo subway
attack that killed 12 and injured more than five thousand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atropine is a mainline defense for many chemicals of mass
destruction,'' said Dobson. ``What we're doing is making certain
how much each hospital has and where it is if we need it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, clinicians will be looking for signs of biological
warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax, for example, is caused by a spore-forming bacterium
that produces flu-like symptoms that worsen quickly.
</P>
<P>
   An epidemic of anthax in its early stages could be confused with
a wide variety of viral, bacterial or fungal infections, so
epidemiologists will be on alert to try to discern patterns that
would discriminate such an epidemic from a more mundane outbreak of
the flu, Plough said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the issues around planning is very rapidly trying to
determine what's happening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The health department, which monitors 52 diseases on an ongoing
basis anyway, is well equipped to do the epidemiological analysis
to pick up an attack, he said. ``We do this everyday, 7 days a
week, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The incubation period for anthrax can be one to six days,
followed by gradual, non-specific symptoms that may include fever,
malaise, fatigue and coughing.
</P>
<P>
   Two to three days after that, however, the symptoms develop into
severe respiratory distress and shock and death may follow within
24 to 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Anthrax is a particular concern because it's difficult to treat,
Dobson said. ``It's treatable, yes. How successful is a question.''
</P>
<P>
   Botulism, which is caused by neurotoxins produced by the
bacterium Clostridium botulinum, is treatable, but often requires
putting patients on ventilators to prevent them from dying.
</P>
<P>
   The symptoms of botulism begin as early as 24 to 36 hours
following exposure. Patients may initially show generalized
weakness, dizziness, and drooping eyelids, followed by extreme
dryness of the mouth and nose. Motor symptoms also begin early on
and may include blurred vision, and difficulty swallowing.
</P>
<P>
   The most frequent cause of death is respiratory failure caused
by paralysis of respiratory muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Smallpox is also a concern, Dobson said. Even though the disease
has been eradiacated in nature since 1978, there is a small but
real possibility that secret stores of the virus exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unlikely, and we're unaware of any, but we can't rule it
out,'' he said. Because the disease has been eradicated, a
percentage of the population has never been immunized against it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can be fatal, but it is treatable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with some of the biological agents are the lag times
before symptoms appear, Plough said. Smallpox, for example, can
take days or weeks to show up.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to biological agents, hospitals are taking steps to
prepare for chemical attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Washington Medical Center, for example, is
increasing its nursing staff and number of doctors on-call by about
20 percent, said Shirley Tainter, nurse manager of the UW's
emergency department.
</P>
<P>
   Swedish is also increasing staff by about 20 percent for the
week of the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a fair amount of effort to design facilities and
pre-establish some decon (decontamination) stuff in the area,''
said Copass. ``We want to emphasize, we're always in a state of
readiness for things that don't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has taken steps to establish decontamination centers at
various undisclosed locations, he said. ``The equipment is in
place.
</P>
<P>
   Area hospitals are preparing and upgrading their decontamination
facilities to make them independent of the fire department in the
event of a massive event.
</P>
<P>
   If such an event occurs, ``the reality is, we won't be able to
call 911 (for help with decontamination),'' said Marianne Klaas,
accreditation and safety manager for Swedish Medical Center. So the
hospital, like others in the area, is investing in its own
decontamination equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to shut down the hospital, filter people
through a central intake where we can shower and wash them down,''
she said. The hospital has purchased $50,000 worth of tents,
special respirators, protective suits, boots and gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the emphasis on biological and chemical attacks,
however, the biggest concern remains physical injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bioterrorism is a concern, but the greater likelihood of
disaster has to do with riots or injury resulting from protests,''
Dobson said. ``Our hope is it will be business as usual and there
will be large and peaceful demonstrations and no one gets hurt.''

GOVERNOR TESTS THE WINDS WITH MOVES ON EMISSIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Last summer, as environmentalists called for air
pollution controls on New York's oldest power plants, Gov. George
Pataki showed no interest, declining to include them in a related
bill. Then, his administration briefly backed away from its demand
that plants in other states cut their emissions, before reversing
itself under intense criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, who praise some aspects of the governor's
record, seized on those events to assail him on air quality. What a
difference a few weeks make. With recent moves to impose strict
emission limits on old power plants and new cars, Pataki has
suddenly jumped to the head of the line among the nation's
governors in fighting air pollution, winning a chorus of accolades
from environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and his aides insist that his actions should be
taken at face value and that their timing was coincidental. But
Democrats, environmentalists and not a few of the governor's fellow
Republicans say they cannot help but see links to the heat he took
last summer, to his budding rivalry with the state's new,
Democratic attorney general, or to his hopes of being tapped as his
party's vice presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   And for some who have closely followed these events, there is a
nagging suspicion that questions about Pataki's motives stem, in
part, from the reluctance of environmentalists _ not to mention
some reporters and voters _ to give a Republican the benefit of the
doubt on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that might be true for a lot of environmental
organizations, but I really don't think it's true for us,'' said
Larry Shapiro, an environmental lawyer at the New York Public
Interest Research Group. ``Look, I believe the governor has always
truly cared about environmental concerns. But that doesn't mean
that politics don't enter into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, in an interview Monday, said: ``It's just amazing to me
that something that I've been deeply involved in since I was a
little kid, people can question my motives. I think it reflects
more of the mind-set of the liberal press and their bias.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a number of things,'' said Val Washington, director
of Environmental Advocates, a coalition of groups, ``that had
called into question the governor's leadership on the environment,
and I think it's clear he has set out to reassert himself because
he sees this as his territory and he wants to protect it.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists and some legislators have long wanted the
state to limit pollution from old power plants that were exempt
from stringent state and federal controls, but Pataki ignored calls
to include it this year in a bill on granting environmental permits
to new plants.
</P>
<P>
   For years, New York and neighboring states have called on the
federal government to crack down on power-plant emissions from the
Midwest and the South, which blow into the Northeast and contribute
to smog and acid rain. This summer, the Pataki administration
floated a proposed compromise with the other regions, only to
withdraw it under fire from other Northeastern states and
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, said he
would sue 17 out-of-state power plants under the federal Clean Air
Act. A few weeks later, he put eight New York plants on notice that
they, too, might be in violation of the act and could face legal
action.
</P>
<P>
   Not only had the governor suffered a spate of bad publicity on
air-quality issues but also after years of being the state's most
prominent conservationist, he suddenly took a back seat to Spitzer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, he was feeling the heat,'' said Assemblyman Richard
Brodsky, chairman of the Environmental Conservation Committee. ``He
felt pressured by Spitzer's moves and the pressure we have been
applying for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki took back the spotlight last month _ and stunned many
environmental groups _ when he announced that he would order sharp
cuts in emissions by older plants in New York, doing
administratively what a few months earlier, he had refused to do
legislatively.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when the Clinton administration said it would take
enforcement action against power plants in the Midwest and the
South, the governor repeatedly claimed credit for pressuring the
federal government into it.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki announced this week that New York would impose tough new
emission standards on vehicles, starting in 2004, a step that,
unlike his move against power plants, was not a surprise. The
timing made New York the first state to join California, which
created the standards, barely beating Massachusetts, which is
expected to adopt them soon, and allowing the governor, once again,
to claim national leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of events has spawned a new set of theories.
One has it that Pataki has largely abandoned his hopes of getting
on the national ticket, and is securing his status in New York. But
another holds that since Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the
front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination, may be
vulnerable on his environmental record, the party would do well to
choose a vice presidential nominee who has a stronger environmental
record.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Morris, a Democratic consultant, said, in a reference to
Bush, ``Maybe Pataki read that Houston has the most polluted air in
the country.''

2 CITIES VIE TO BECOME PERMANENT HOME OF BATTLESHIP NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (mk) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it the battle for the battleship, or the north vs. the
south.
</P>
<P>
   As the much-decorated and now decommissioned battleship New
Jersey heads slowly toward that state, the Navy is trying to decide
which of two cities will become its permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   The contest is between two decidedly unglamorous places trying
to transform themselves: Bayonne, an industrial city in the shadow
of the Statue of Liberty, and Camden, an industrial city across the
Delaware River from Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The ship, which had been berthed in Bremerton, Wash., since
being decommissioned in 1991, was towed through the Panama Canal
toward the East Coast. Long before its expected arrival on
Thursday, it had become an object of intense attention, from
veterans and military buffs eager to walk its teak decks and from
the two cities eager to attract tourists. Each city is seeking to
persuade the Navy that it is best suited to accommodate the ship
and preserve it as a museum, and the competition has started to
take on the undertones of the north-south rivalry that often
defines New Jersey politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bayonne supporters say that the battleship, the most decorated
in the American fleet, should be where most New Jersey residents
can have access to it. They reason that because two-thirds of the
state's residents live north of Trenton, the state capital, the
ship is likely to attract more tourists if it is in the New York
City metropolitan area, which would help support its expensive
upkeep.
</P>
<P>
   Camden backers say the battleship ought to be near its
birthplace, the Philadelphia Naval Shipyards, where it was built in
1942. The battleship will be set up as a museum on the revitalized
Camden waterfront, next to the two-year-old New Jersey Aquarium and
just across the Delaware from downtown Philadelphia and its
historical attractions. The Delaware River, they also point out,
will provide a freshwater port for the ship, an important
consideration in preserving the battleship's aging steel hull.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides cite a long list of pros and cons, and many who care
about the ship's fate fear that a decision will come down to
politics. If that is the case, some say, North Jersey could
prevail, as it often has.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have more clout up in the north than we do here in the
south,'' said John Horan of Cherry Hill, N.J., who was a signalman
on the original crew for two and a half years during World War II.
Horan, who said he would visit the ship no matter where it ended
up, said he would rather see it in Camden, 10 minutes from his
home, but expected the north to win. ``In the state as a whole,
North Jersey gets a lot more than South Jersey,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe not this time. A few days before the ship is to arrive
in Philadelphia, its temporary home, the scales may be tipping in
Camden's favor. While the Navy wouldn't say what it would do before
a decision was announced, possibly in January, Camden's proposal
has gained powerful support in Washington. Backers include senators
and representatives and the secretary for housing and urban
development, Andrew Cuomo. Meanwhile, the Bayonne plan has been
garnering more critics, including several U.S. representatives from
the New York City area, and the directors of the Intrepid, a
similar floating museum at a Manhattan pier.

JOHN PUELICHER, 78, BANK HOLDING COMPANY CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Ariz., Ill., Fla.)  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John A. Puelicher, retired chairman of the board of Marshall &AMP;
Ilsley Corp., a bank holding company, died on Oct. 30 at his home
in Milwaukee. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was liver cancer, said a company spokesman,
M.A. Hatfield.
</P>
<P>
   Puelicher, who was known as Jack, led a venerable
Milwaukee-based company that was previously headed by his father,
Albert S. Puelicher, and his grandfather, John Puelicher. He was
also a prominent benefactor of civic, charitable and educational
causes in Milwaukee and elsewhere in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   During Puelicher's years as chairman, from 1963 to 1992, M &AMP; I,
as it is often called, grew rapidly, making 44 acquisitions. In
1963, the bank had $420 million in assets; in 1992, it had $7.15
billion, including M &AMP; I Data Services, which provides computer
services for banks.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the company has assets of $23.6 billion in its operations
in Wisconsin, Arizona and Illinois. The Puelicher family has run
the bank since 1920. Samuel Marshall founded the bank in 1847, and
Charles Ilsley joined it two years later.
</P>
<P>
   John Albert Puelicher was born on Nov. 4, 1920, in Milwaukee. He
attended Dartmouth College and graduated from the University of
Wisconsin at Madison. He worked at the family bank for several
years before serving as a lieutenant in the Navy during World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Puelicher rejoined the bank, working as a vice
president and executive vice president before his election as
president in 1958. Upon his father's death in 1963, he became
chairman.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - For more than a week, the most pow erful politicians in
the state of Ari zona were consumed completely by a sometimes
bitter, often accusatory, al ways boisterous argument over hair
curl ers. Or, perhaps, curling irons.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Depending upon whom you believe.
</P>
<P>
   It began when the state's speaker of the House, Jeff Groscost,
repeated what he thought was a funny story to a reporter from USA
Today. Groscost talked about being on a road trip with Gov. Jane
Hull, Secretary of State Betsey Bayless and state Senate President
Brenda Burns, in which he listened to the women debate the pros and
cons of 2-inch and quarter-inch curlers.
</P>
<P>
   USA Today sent a writer to Arizona to report on how the state's
top five elected positions are held by women. The front-page
article with Groscost's anec dote was printed on a Friday, Oct.
29th.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Hull told an audience of 2,000 professional women
that she would ``send a pointed message to the speaker . . . to
remind him we don't talk about curlers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We talk about issues, and we talk about what's good for the
state of Ari zona,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's press secretary called it ``a chauvinistic
remark,'' adding, ``(We) are disappointed that the speaker had the
opportunity to showcase the state to the national media and,
instead, made a wise crack that was not true.''
</P>
<P>
   With his veracity in question, Groscost found someone to back up
his story. Early the following week, he trotted out state Rep. Lori
Daniels, the House majority leader, who said she was on the trip,
too, and remembered the women discussing hair care.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were talking about the size of our curling irons and
driving him crazy,'' Daniels said.
</P>
<P>
   Back and forth the officials went, split ting hairs, stirring up
the kind of free wheeling public debate that hasn't existed in
America since we pondered the ques tion:
</P>
<P>
   ``Does she or doesn't she?''
</P>
<P>
   A COLLECTIVE `NOOOOOO!'
</P>
<P>
   About a week later, when the quarrel ling ended and the
politicians put aside their juvenile carping and promised to de
vote their time and energy to government, it was as if everyone in
the state took a deep breath and let out a collective ``Noooooo!''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that when politicos are busy getting into each
other's hair, they can't get into ours.
</P>
<P>
   So, if our top officials don't want to talk about curlers
anymore, how about lip gloss? Or dishpan hands?
</P>
<P>
   Why bother with taxation, transporta tion or education, when
we've yet to eliminate ring around the collar?
</P>
<P>
   And what about recipes?
</P>
<P>
   As they used to tell us on TV, ``Nothin' says lovin' like
somethin' from the oven.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Groscost told USA Today, ``I finally understood what
ladies have long talked about: having to endure men's talk about
football and basketball games.''
</P>
<P>
   He should run with that thought.
</P>
<P>
   And if he and fellow members of the state House run out of
football and bas ketball stories, they could move on to baseball
and hockey.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer. Auto racing. Fly-fishing. La crosse.
</P>
<P>
   Or go full circle, to curling. The ``sport.'' The only
competition in the Olympics featuring ice, a stone and a couple of
guys with brooms.
</P>
<P>
   WELCOME DISTRACTIONS
</P>
<P>
   If recent weeks have taught us any thing, it's that politicians
cannot simulta neously pull on each other's pompadours and pick our
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   On a national level, the impeachment of President Clinton served
the same pur pose, protecting the public from politi cians for the
better part of a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than dragging the country into that kind of toilet,
however, why not fol low Arizona's model and discuss, say, drain
cleaners? Or static cling?
</P>
<P>
   The women running Arizona proved they can be as small-minded as
any man. With your encouragement, they'll sink to even greater
depths. It won't be easy. And should they ever claim to run out
trivial subjects to argue about, remember:
</P>
<P>
   There's always room for Jell-O. &QL;
