MORGAN SHARES LEAD IN SENIOR CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Joe Inman was so sharp he hit into more divots
than he missed greens. Ed Dougherty showed up with his super-sub
caddie. And Dr. Gil Morgan did what he does routinely at this time
of year _ shoot again in the 60s.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to earn all of them a berth in today's final
threesome at the Pacific Bell Senior Classic after each opened with
a 5-under-par 66 to share the lead at Wilshire Country Club on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The three leaders enter the middle round one stroke up on Lee
Trevino, two ahead of Buzz Thomas, Brian Barnes and Ray Floyd and
three in front of a foursome including Larry Nelson and tour rookie
Allen Doyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good round on a good course,'' summed Dougherty, who
parlayed the support and advice of local caddie Cecilio Olmedo into
a bogeyless round that included five birdies on greens many seniors
were calling the fastest they have seen on tour this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a hard course for most of us but Doc,'' said Inman, a
first-year scrambler playing his 34th tournament of the year in an
attempt to secure playing time next year.
</P>
<P>
   Inman, who had to hit out of divots three times, missed just two
greens but said he he found plenty of anxiety once aboard: ``These
greens are quick, Holy Mackerel!''
</P>
<P>
   Not too quick for Morgan, the two-time defending tournament
champion who would be dominating the tour for a second straight
year but for record-setting Hale Irwin, the 1997 Player of the Year
and current $2.5 million man who skipped this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, bidding for his seventh win of the season, rolled in
birdie putts of 10, 10 and 20 feet and two-putted from 45 feet for
another birdie during a six-birdie round that included just one
bogey. It was his seventh straight round in the 60s at Wilshire,
where Morgan has shot 68, 68, 66, 67, 66, 65 the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   What would he do if they ever moved the tournament?
</P>
<P>
   ``After I stop crying?'' Morgan asked. ``If they moved it, I
don't know what I'd do.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably lead the charge on another course, Trevino suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gil has been playing well on !ital!all!off! of them, not just
this one,'' Trevino said. ``One thing that helps him here is his
power. He's so long he's able to play the shorter courses with a
3-wood or long iron on most holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that and despite putting that is markedly improved since
his PGA Tour days, Morgan said he entered Friday's opening round
worried about his play after struggling in the pro-am.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure I'd be able to find my ball out there,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out, it was on the green early and often. He birdied the
first two holes and three of four during a hot stretch on the back
nine to share the lead and surprise himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was lucky,'' said Morgan, who holds a Doctor of Optometry
degree but has never practiced in that specialty _ instead earning
more that $9.5 million in 25 years of professional golf, $4.2
million in less than three full years as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   Inman can appreciate that senior success and thinks he has the
game to be competitive on this tour. But as a first-year senior
with marginal career earnings, he must play as much as he can just
to retain 1999 eligibility on a tour where access is dictated by
single-season earnings and/or career winnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've done my work, I've proven I can play with these guys,''
said Inman, who earned full-time 1998 exemption by placing fifth in
last year's senior qualifying school. ``I don't know if I can win.
I'm fighting for access.... the hardest thing out here is access.''
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty knows a bit about that, having to sit out as first
alternate last week at Hawaii and needing a sponsor's exemption to
play this week despite ranking 41st in '98 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   He credits longtime friend J.C. Snead for helping ease the
frustration of not playing last week, and credits caddie Olmedo for
smoothing his play at Wilshire and other West Coast stops.
</P>
<P>
   Olmedo, a Riviera caddie willing to work for Dougherty for just
one round during the 1995 PGA Championship at Riviera, instead
worked that entire tournament and has been on Dougherty's bag often
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Colbert, a top-five finisher in this tournament the past two
years, shot 72 Friday to share 30th place, one stroke ahead of
television broadcaster Gary McCord.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert, who survived 1997 prostate cancer surgery, as did golf
legend Arnold Palmer, played in the same group with Palmer, who
shot 81.

CHURCH RULES TO HALT DAY OF DEAD TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To mark the Day of the Dead in Latino tradition,
the Corralejo family gathered at the grave to decorate it with
things he loved most: his favorite toy truck, his stuffed Felix the
Cat, candles and sweet bread.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the items will have to be removed because the Roman
Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles has decided to enforce a rule
that bans leaving such items on graves as part of (ITAL)Dia de los
Muertos(END ITAL) and most other holiday celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, cemetery workers handed out cards reminding families
of the 20-year-old rule, which does not forbid people from leaving
Christmas trees and other ornaments for Christmas and Easter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea why it limits it to the two holidays of
Christmas and Easter other than to speculate that those are the two
most important Christian holidays,'' said the Rev. Gregory Coiro,
spokesman for the archdiocese, which serves 4 million Catholics _
two-thirds whom are Latino.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Souls' Day (Monday) is officially on the church calendar,
but that does not mean that every way it's commemorated is
necessarily appropriate,'' said Coiro. ``Leaving food on graves is
not a Christian tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Cemetery workers also said that Day of the Dead participants
leave behind too much trash, and the candles left behind are fire
hazards, not to mention the danger of broken glass.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the eve of Day of the Dead, cultural experts
criticized the archdiocese for having a double standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexican culture, Day of the Dead is a big thing and to
prohibit (Latinos) from celebrating the dead in their own cemetery
I find difficult to understand,'' said Jose Hernandez, an urban and
Chicano studies professor at California State University,
Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up with the kind of culture where we would spend the
whole day at the cemetery,'' said Hernandez, a native of Eagle
Pass, Texas. ``We had tamales ... we had music, we had a
celebration. I don't know why the Catholic Church would see it as a
bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico and Central America, families host all-night
candlelight vigils during the two days of the holiday, complete
with the favorite foods of their loved ones, candles and even music
at the cemeteries. At midnight, church bells toll to announce the
opening of the cemeteries and the opening to the other world.
</P>
<P>
   Though not as popular as in Latin America, legions of Latinos in
the United States have embraced this tradition, including the
Corralejos, who celebrated it for the first time this year in honor
of their son Kenneth.
</P>
<P>
   While creating their son's altar at the San Fernando Mission
Cemetery, the family was approached by a cemetery maintenance
worker who handed them a notice outlining the archdiocese's policy.
</P>
<P>
   San Fernando Mission cemetery Manager Maria Orozco said the
policy is in place for safety reasons. Candles can be fire hazards
and glass objects can pose threats to both maintenance workers and
patrons, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of visitations and we're liable ... that's why
we have to put these controls,'' said Orozco, who allows patrons to
decorate graves with fresh flowers only.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they do pray and bring decorations they can take it with
them when they leave,'' Orozco said.
</P>
<P>
   In East Los Angeles, local cemeteries refused to allow Self-Help
Graphics to start their annual Day of the Dead procession from
inside the cemetery a few years ago, according to the cultural art
center's director Tomas Benitez.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drama, the spectacle, the group thing is probably what
cemeteries find intimidating because they see this going on and
they ask, Why are you having a party here?'' he said. ``It
underscores the remaining cultural differences when it comes to the
cemeteries.''
</P>
<P>
   Although grave site visits are a normal part of American
culture, cemeteries still have a macabre reputation in popular
culture, Benitez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In America, you certainly aren't going to go to the cemetery
at night ... where as in Mexico at night is when it's most
beautiful to celebrate Day of the Dead,'' he said. ``In Mexico
death is part of life, the cemetery is part of the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   To adapt, Latinos in Los Angeles head to the cemeteries during
the day or simply celebrate by heading to ceremonies hosted by art
centers, Benitez said.
</P>
<P>
   The Corralejos will do both. Over the next two days they will
create altars for their son at Mission College and at the Andres
Pico Adobe, where the San Fernando Valley Latino Arts Council will
host a Dia de los Muertos Festival on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday the family reminisced as they decorated his grave with
(ITAL)pan de muerto(END ITAL), (bread of the dead), with a circular
shape decorated with bones made of meringue to symbolize the circle
of life and death. They also decorated the grave with orange and
gold marigolds, whose pungent smell draws the dead, and with
candles, which are used to illuminate the path of the souls as they
return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though he's gone, there's always the remembrance of what he
did, of what he liked,'' said Rachel Corralejo, whose son died of
AIDS last March at age 39.
</P>
<P>
   The family remembered how their son always gave to charities,
how he dedicated himself to folklorico dancing, how he had a
fascination with history, how he always offered his help to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a really giving person,'' said his sister Anna
Jaramillo, 34. ``I just like the feeling that his spirit is here,
guiding us.''

PRACTICE SPEEDS LOWER AT FONTANA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ As intended, use of the Handford Device held
speeds down during CART practice Friday at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of turning laps with speeds over 240 mph as several
drivers did at last year's event when Mauricio Gugelmin turned in
the fastest official lap in history (240.942 mph), the fastest guy
Friday was Adrian Fernandez at 236.564.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers said today's qualifying speeds should be even lower
because drivers won't have anyone to draft on.
</P>
<P>
   Most drivers are glad the speeds are down, even if not by much.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't done something, we'd be going even faster this
year because of (improved) technology,'' said Greg Moore, whose
234.951 mph lap was third best Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But while the device _ a wing that grabs air as the car moves
through it _ slows speeds, it also tends to level the playing field
for the race, since it promotes drafting that enables slower cars
to be sucked along with their faster competitors. The result is a
lot of pack racing that is reminiscent of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 230 mph, that kind of racing is dangerous, Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to drive heads up,'' Moore said. ``We'll be
racing in packs of 10 or so and any little mistake could be a big
one. We could hurt either ourself or someone else real bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the danger, Moore is looking forward to that kind of
racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Michigan (where the device was used earlier this
year) was the most fun race I've ever been in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Crime and punishment: CART announced Friday that Team KOOL Green
driver Paul Tracy will be barred from entering the series' 1999
season opener in Miami as punishment for his actions in an incident
with Michael Andretti two weeks ago in Australia and for other
driving incidents this season.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first time CART has suspended a driver from a race.
</P>
<P>
   CART steward Wally Dallenbach noted that the severity of the
discipline stems from Tracy's involvement in 10 driving incidents
this season that have resulted in contact with other cars.
</P>
<P>
   Indy Lights: Tony Renna won the pole position for today's (3
p.m.) Indy Lights 100-mile race with a top lap speed of 187.668
mph. Mark Hotchkiss of Pasadena will be next to Renna after turning
in a lap of 187.201.
</P>
<P>
   Renna also won the pole _ and then race _ earlier this year at
the Michigan Speedway, the other superspeedway on the Indy Lights
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   New job: Arciero-Wells Racing announced that Cristiano da Matta,
who has already cinched the Indy Lights title, will drive the No.25
MCI CART car next season.
</P>
<P>
   Max Papis will drive the car a final time Sunday for
Arciero-Wells but has signed with Team Rahal for next year.
</P>
<P>
   Da Matta qualified sixth for today's Indy Lights event.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal flame-out: CART practice went without mishap Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bobby Rahal's final race weekend got off to a shaky start
when his engine burst into flames.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal was not injured but had to bring out a backup car to
continue practice.

DEIDRE MURPHY, 47, NEWSPAPER EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deidre S. Murphy, assistant managing editor for news
at The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., died Thursday at St. Mary
Hospital in Hoboken. She was 47.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy was hospitalized after suffering a stroke Wednesday
night as she walked near her home in Hoboken, said Scott Ladd,
metropolitan editor of The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy, known as Dee, went to New York in 1988 to be an
assistant city editor at New York Newsday. She was later deputy
metro editor. She helped supervise the paper's coverage of a subway
crash that killed five people, caused by a motorman who was drunk.
The coverage won the Pulitzer Prize for spot news in 1992. She also
helped lead the coverage of the 1993 bombing of the World Trade
Center.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, after New York Newsday was closed, she went to work at
The Star-Ledger, overseeing the paper's news-gathering operation.
She left briefly to be metropolitan editor at The New York Daily
News in 1997, then returned to The Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Murphy was born in Springfield, Ill. Her first newspaper job
was as a reporter for her hometown paper, The State
Journal-Register, and she later worked as a reporter and city
editor at The Democrat &AMP; Chronicle in Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her companion, Theadora Martens, and her
mother, Helen Murphy, of Springfield.

HASKEL TAKING OFFERS, GETS NONE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Pump specialist Haskel International Inc.
announced Friday it has placed itself on the sales block but has
not received a buyout offer yet.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement pushed up Haskel's stock by $1.125 to $11, an
11 percent gain and its highest close since late March.
</P>
<P>
   The Burbank-based company, which has 340 employees and annual
sales of about $50 million, announced Oct. 20 it hired investment
banker Schroder &AMP; Co. to evaluate strategic alternatives to improve
growth opportunities, including acquisitions, a buyout or a merger.
R. Malcolm Graves, president and chief executive officer, said at
the time that Haskel stock was undervalued and the issue has risen
36 percent since then.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement Friday at Haskel's annual shareholders
meeting, Graves said the company is ``active'' in discussing
possible acquisitions. ``We are simultaneously pursuing the
possible sale of the company,'' he said in a statement. ``These
discussions, however, remain exploratory, and no offers have been
received or are being considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskel went public in late 1994 at $10 a share, and the stock
hit an all-time high of $16 in September 1997. The issue hit a
two-year low of $6.625 in early September.
</P>
<P>
   Haskel, which also produces air pressure amplifiers, had 4.76
million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, giving the company a
market capitalization of $52.3 million at Friday's closing price.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported month-ago earnings of $919,000, or 19 cents
a diluted share, off 17 percent from the year-ago period due partly
to the Asian slowdown causing lower order levels. Sales declined
3.5 percent to $12.1 million, partly due to a discontinued
business.

BARNES BATTLES GREENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Brit was back in full bloom Friday and only
too happy to discuss the bloomin' greens, his claim to bloomin'
fame and the effects of his last bloomin' round in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   First things first for chain-smoking Brian Barnes, the big and
colorful Briton whose opening round of 3-under-par 68 left him two
strokes off the lead in the Pacific Bell Senior Classic at Wilshire
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Just how fast were those greens?
</P>
<P>
   ``Very much like Masters speed,'' said Barnes, who played in a
threesome with Bob Charles and watched Charles four-putt No.16
after his approach shot hit the green eight feet from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riviera's greens weren't this fast at the Senior Open,'' said
Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Riviera, how long did it take Barnes to recover from
his bittersweet final round in the Senior Open? That day, he shared
the lead with seven holes to play before incurring a penalty for
failing to re-mark before a putt on No.12, and then, steaming,
bogeyed the next hole and wound up three strokes back of winner
Hale Irwin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't got over it yet,'' Barnes said. ``You don't get that
many chances to win a major title. Doing what I did at the U.S.
Seniors cost me the British Senior (which he had won in '95 and
'96) because I went though the motions in that particular event and
lost by a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes admits mental replaying is futile but still wonders what
might have happened had he not forgotten he'd moved his ballmark
out of an opponent's putting line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had I not made that !ital!faux pas, if I'd finished as I had
done without that, it would have meant Hale would have had to hole
from 15 feet to tie instead of holing to win _ which is a little
more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``You only get a few chances to win one of the majors, and that
was one of the better chances I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   As for chances to play regularly on the Senior PGA Tour, where
access is the most important element for many tour newcomers,
Barnes long ago enhanced his chances _ by defeating Jack Nicklaus
twice in one day during the 1975 Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of watershed event that has earned Barnes
numerous sponsor exemptions on the senior tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beating Jack twice in one day still, over here, is a
passport,'' he said. ``I personally feel I've done things a little
bit more important than that (the U.S. won that '75 Ryder Cup
despite Barnes), but if that's a passport I'll take it and be more
than happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The scent of victory: Golf's most distinguished elder statesman
was honored again Friday on the first tee at Wilshire Country Club,
when 69-year-old Arnold Palmer was presented a bouquet of roses by
a young fan.
</P>
<P>
   While Palmer was palming the petals, John Glenn, the equally
high-profile space-program elder, was catching a few good-natured
thorns from wise-cracking senior golfer Lee Trevino, teeing off one
group ahead of Palmer:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 77 years old,'' Trevino said of the legendary astronaut
now circling the earth aboard Discovery. ``He should be sitting on
a porch rocking. Whatever he learns in space in nine days, he'll
forget it two weeks after he gets back.''
</P>
<P>
   Super-seniors: Lee Elder shot 34-36_70 to take a one-stroke lead
over Harold Henning, Dale Douglass and Bruce Crampton in the
tournament-within-a-tournament for seniors aged 60 and over.
</P>
<P>
   That 36-hole competition, formerly known as the Super Seniors
and now called the MasterCard Champions, has a purse of $120,000,
with $18,000 to the winner. Elder has never won in this format.

EDITORIAL: REFORMING WORLD MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 31:
</P>
<P>
   The world's leading industrial nations have sketched out a plan
to revamp the international financial system and improve the
handling of economic crises. It looks promising, but will be
difficult to carry out.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's statement by the Group of 7 countries recognized that
the great growth of global financial markets has not been
accompanied by a similar expansion in global regulatory
capabilities, and rightly called for more disclosures by countries,
international agencies and major market participants. The
industrial nations now agree with smaller countries that big
players in the foreign exchange markets _ banks and hedge funds, in
particular _ should have to disclose their positions. If such rules
are adopted, they will be relatively easy to apply to banks, but
very difficult to apply to hedge funds, which are likely to locate
in countries that do not enforce disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of the past several years has shown that global
markets can move in ways that seem irrational. In the middle of
this decade, investors poured money into emerging countries, often
heedless of the fact that accounting standards were weak and
essential financial information not made public. Then, particularly
after the Russian default, those same investors stampeded out.
Better disclosure might have helped, but nothing that regulators
can do will prevent markets from occasionally moving in excessive
ways.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect of international rescues in
recent years _ before the Russian collapse _ has been that the pain
was often felt solely by citizens of the country being rescued,
from Mexico to Thailand, as the country was forced to adopt
belt-tightening measures. Investors who had made imprudent loans
often escaped with handsome profits.
</P>
<P>
   The Group of 7 statement tries to change that in two ways.
First, it proposes a new World Bank rescue program to help the
poorest people when financial crises occur. Second, it calls for
private-sector participation in bailouts. Details will not be easy
to work out, or to enforce, but the idea of making investors help
finance bailouts is wise.
</P>
<P>
   When Asia's ``miracle'' began to unravel more than a year ago,
the industrial world was slow to realize that the problems could
spread widely. But that danger is now widely understood, and
Friday's statement is another encouraging sign that the major
countries are committed to keeping the world's economy growing.

LACROIX GLAD TO ESCAPE COLORADO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Eric Lacroix was not in the Kings lineup the night
after being re-acquired in a trade with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no doubt the Kings and Lacroix are happy to be back
together after an absence of two-plus seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Larry Robinson can't get enough physical forwards
and Lacroix needed a change from a situation in Colorado that for
him ``had become unbearable.''
</P>
<P>
   A Denver Post columnist wrote recently that ``sons should pay
for the sins of the father,'' referring to Eric's father, Pierre,
the general manager of an Avalanche team that is off to 2-5-1
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever a good team is struggling people look for things and
this time they focused on me because of my father,'' Lacroix said.
``It wasn't easy (to ask to be traded), but it was the right thing
for me and the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix scored career highs in goals (18) and points (36) in his
first season with Colorado (1996-97). He scored 16 goals for the
Kings in '95-96 and 16 for the Avalanche last season.
</P>
<P>
   That and his checking ability make him very attractive to
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point he could be a first- or second-line guy,'' said
Robinson when asked if he expected Lacroix to help the third and
fourth lines. ``He goes hard to the net and that's something we've
been preaching all year long.''
</P>
<P>
   Failed to deliver: Roman Vopat, who was sent to Colorado along
with a sixth-round choice in the 1999 draft, was a major
disappointment after being acquired from St. Louis in the trade
that sent Wayne Gretzky to St. Louis in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Never the physical presence he was expected to be, Vopat (6-3,
223) scored four goals and 12 points in 57 games with Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Road to recovery: Forward Ian Laperriere skated for the third
consecutive day without pain on Friday morning and will begin to
practice with the Kings today.
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere, who suffered a partially torn anterior cruciate
ligament in his left knee in the second game of the season, feels
he isn't that far away from playing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get too optimistic,'' he said. ``But I feel I
could return as soon as next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Laperriere thinks he can avoid surgery during the season, but
said it probably will be required after the season.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: In the ongoing saga of the Kings' injured
goalies, Jamie Storr (right groin strain) skated without pads
Friday. He will skate with pads in the next few days and could be
cleared to play in about a week.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Fiset (left groin strain) is also about a week away,
meaning the Kings will continue to go with Manny Legace and Ryan
Bach.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jozef Stumpel, who has missed six games with a hip flexor
strain and an abdominal strain, saw a hernia specialist and the
results were normal (no hernia). Stumpel, who is listed as
week-to-week, is not skating and will continue to rehab and rest.

POLLS FIND SEVERAL RACES TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Md., N.C., Nev., S.C.)  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `p') 
(js) 
 BY B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Election Day draws closer, many Senate and governor's races
are drawing closer, too. Going into the final weekend of
campaigning, no more than half a dozen points separate Democratic
and Republican candidates in at least half a dozen Senate races and
a dozen governor's races, a spread that sometimes can be closed in
a last-minute rush of advertising and stumping.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of the races, the spread is even narrower and, in
fact, has changed little in the better part of a month.
</P>
<P>
   Following are the latest poll results from six of the closest
Senate and governor's races:
</P>
<P>
   -- In North Carolina's Senate race, according to a Mason-Dixon
Poll conducted Oct. 26 through 28, Sen. Lauch Faircloth, the
Republican incumbent, leads his Democratic challenger, John
Edwards, an attorney, by 44 percent to 43 percent. Two weeks ago,
another Mason-Dixon poll gave Faircloth a two-point lead, not
significantly different.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll, conducted after President Clinton's character
became an issue in the campaign, covered 827 likely voters and has
a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the Kentucky Senate contest for an open seat, a
Mason-Dixon Poll taken on Oct. 26 and 27 has Rep. Scotty Baesler,
the Democrat, leading Rep. Jim Bunning, the Republican, by 46
percent to 45 percent, essentially the same result found a few days
earlier by a Bluegrass State Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll, conducted after both candidates began questioning
each other's voting consistency in Congress, covered 823 likely
voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Nevada's Senate race, Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic
incumbent, leads his Republican challenger, Rep. John Ensign, by 47
percent to 45 percent, according to a Mason-Dixon poll conducted
Oct. 25 through 27.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, when both candidates were struggling, as they
are now, to connect with the tens of thousands of new residents in
the booming state, another Mason-Dixon poll came up with
essentially the same result.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll surveyed 817 likely voters and has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the contest for governor in South Carolina, a Mason-Dixon
Poll conducted Oct. 26 through 28 found the Republican incumbent,
Gov. David M. Beasley, losing his edge over his Democratic
challenger, former state Rep. Jim Hodges. The governor had a
relatively comfortable lead of nine percentage points in a
Mason-Dixon Poll taken in late September, but in the new poll, he
leads by only two points, 46 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, taken after a month of increasingly negative
campaigning, surveyed 806 likely voters and has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. It indicates that the
undecided segment of the vote may be breaking toward Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the Maryland governor's race, a new Mason-Dixon Poll
indicates that Gov. Parris N. Glendening, the Democratic incumbent,
has inched ahead a bit in a tight contest with his Republican
challenger, Ellen R. Sauerbrey, also his opponent in 1994. The
poll, conducted Oct. 26 through 28, found Glendening ahead by four
points, 49 percent to 45 percent, about the same margin found a
week earlier in a Washington Post poll.
</P>
<P>
   But a week before the Post poll, another Mason-Dixon Poll found
Glendening ahead by only two points. And a month before that, Ms.
Sauerbrey led by a point.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Mason-Dixon Poll, conducted after the governor
accused Ms. Sauerbrey of being weak on civil rights issues,
surveyed 828 likely voters and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the Nevada governor's contest, where expenditures for
television advertising are beginning to set records, a new
Mason-Dixon Poll has the once wide-open race down to a dead heat.
The poll, which surveyed 817 likely voters Oct. 25 through 27 and
has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, found the
Republican, Kenny Guinn, a former state school superintendent,
leading the Democrat, Jan Jones, the mayor of Las Vegas, by 47
percent to 44 percent. A month earlier, Ms. Jones trailed by 15
points in another Mason-Dixon Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The current governor, Bob Miller, cannot run for another term
under the state's term-limit law.

Alou may exercise trade demand
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the Astros' devastating Division Series loss
to the San Diego Padres, All-Star left fielder Moises Alou
indicated he wouldn't play his trump card _ the one that allows him
to demand a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Was it just a poker face? We'll find out next week.
</P>
<P>
   Alou has until Thursday to inform the Astros if he intends to
exercise the trade clause in his contract, but Astros general
manager Gerry Hunsicker believes Alou is leaning toward demanding a
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to his representation, and there is a distinct
possibility that they will exercise the option,'' Hunsicker said.
``I've had several discussions with them, and they are asking us to
enhance the contract, or they are prepared to demand a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take them at their word. There's a distinct possibility that
they will go through with it, and the sad thing is that I believe
the player wants to stay with us, and we'd like to keep him.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou's contract has a limited no-trade clause. Should he demand
to be dealt, he would at that time give the Astros a list of six
teams to which he would not accept a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Alou couldn't be reached for comment. His agent, Bob Gilhooly,
declined comment other than to say, ``It's a personal matter
between Moises and the Astros.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou, whom the Astros acquired from the Florida Marlins last
year, hit .312 and established career highs in home runs (38) and
RBIs (124) in his first season in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Astros traded for the 32-year-old outfielder after
his first season in a multiyear contract, Alou is able to demand a
trade under terms of baseball's collective-bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   If Alou demands a trade, and the Astros don't honor his request
by March 15, 1999, he will become a free agent. There is no
precedent for a player in Alou's position to demand a trade and
actually have the club grant the request.
</P>
<P>
   But in this case, it's not unreasonable to assume the Astros
might trade Alou if he exercised the option. Their outfield is
overcrowded, and an ongoing offseason saga with Alou most certainly
would affect planning for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   There is a feeling among some members of the organization that
Richard Hidalgo is ready to assume an everyday position in the
outfield. Assuming the Astros plan to keep Hidalgo and Carl Everett
_ both potential stars, not to mention budget-friendly players _
Alou or Derek Bell could be traded.
</P>
<P>
   The fact Alou is considering his trade clause is a bit
surprising, given the fact he said he wanted to return to the
Astros because the team had unfinished business. Alou, who has
three years and $15 million left on his contract, also said money
would not be a determining factor regarding his trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   But there can be no other motive unless he doesn't want to play
for the Astros, which would contradict Alou's last public comments
on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros trade Alou, he's stuck with his current contract.
The only way he can get more money is to work out a more lucrative
deal with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that he is under contract, and we are not
depriving the player of anything by not addressing (the
contract),'' Hunsicker said. ``We don't think (the trade clause) is
fair, but we do recognize that it is his option, and we are trying
to work through the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday also is the last day on which the Astros will have
exclusive negotiating rights with their free agents _ Randy
Johnson, Sean Berry, Tim Bogar and Mike Magnante. They have
declined interest in Magnante.

LOUIMA BUYS GUN FOR PROTECTION FROM OFFICERS, HIS LAWYER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Abner Louima, who prosecutors say was tortured and
threatened by police officers in Brooklyn, has bought a gun out of
fear that the accused officers might seek to harm him, one of his
lawyers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Peter J. Neufeld, said Louima had a gun permit that
he received from the Police Department after the alleged
brutalization by officers in August 1997. But Neufeld said Louima's
application for the permit had been unrelated to his encounter with
the officers.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Neufeld said, Louima applied for the permit before the
alleged attack because he was working as a security guard at the
time. But after the permit was granted, the lawyer said, Louima
decided to buy a gun because ``now he has a better reason'' _ to
keep it ``in his home out of fear that these people who threatened
his life and the life of his family might come into his house and
kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld mentioned the gun when he was asked about a statement in
court papers that lawyers for two of the accused officers filed
Friday in federal district court in Brooklyn. A total of four
officers are charged in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for Officers Charles Schwarz and Thomas Bruder said
they had information that Louima had ``received certain courtesies
from state and federal law enforcement, including the permission to
carry a weapon,'' and they demanded information about this from the
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London, said in an interview that he had
come across information that law enforcement agents had taken
Louima to a shooting range for practice.
</P>
<P>
   Neufeld denied this, saying that Louima ``got no training from
the police or FBI.'' But he said that after purchasing the gun,
Louima ``went to a regular, open-to-the-public target range, where
he got instruction'' from civilians. He said no law enforcement
officials ``intervened to get the permit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Stephen Biegel, a Police Department spokesman, said Louima
applied for the permit in September 1996, nearly a year before the
reported attack, and that the permit was issued last October, two
months after the alleged attack, based only on the original
application.
</P>
<P>
   A law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said, ``The FBI never trained Abner Louima in any
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, Bruder and two other officers, Justin A. Volpe and
Thomas Wiese, are charged with beating Louima in a patrol car after
he was arrested in a street brawl in Flatbush, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe and Schwarz are additionally charged with ramming a stick
into his rectum at a police station house, causing severe injuries,
and Volpe is charged with threatening harm to Louima and his family
if he revealed the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The officers deny all charges.

Flutie's doubters have been much too shortsighted
<TEXT>
<P>
   By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   Singer-songwriter Randy Newman gave some exposure to a sensitive
subject with his hit record Short People. The 1970s smash included
the sterling lyric, ``Short people got no reason to live.''
</P>
<P>
   We urge those who relate to this bias to remain calm and
unheated. It was just a song, not a threat. But the battle
continues in a world populated by giants, the NFL. At the moment,
the target of choice is quarterback Doug Flutie, who came off the
bench a month ago to remove the Buffalo Bills from the critical
list.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the leprechaun from Boston College is proving he really
can play with the big boys. He has won two in a row as a starter
and one in relief, and he is Buffalo's best hope Sunday against the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   And Flutie has to make the most of it, as he does with every
chance. Because when Rob Johnson returns from the injury list, the
starting job again will be his. No one has to tell Flutie life
isn't fair.
</P>
<P>
   The last time dashing Doug faced a team coached by Jimmy Johnson
was in 1984, when the Miami Hurricanes were among the baddest dudes
in college football. They are still the only team whose mascot can
wreck an entire town.
</P>
<P>
   Flutie clinched the Heisman Trophy that season with one play,
the desperation pass that brought down the 'Canes and Bernie Kosar
47-45. The pass traveled 64 yards in the air and into football
folklore, sailing on a high arc through the rainy twilight and
landing in the arms of Flutie's best friend, Gerard Phelan, as the
clock ran out.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Flutie seemed an idol for the times. The country had
taken a turn to the past, and here was a handsome, well-spoken,
well-mannered young man with a flair for high drama. In his
hometown, a western suburb of Boston, the city fathers named a
street after him _ Flutie Pass. And, no, it didn't take long to
complete it.
</P>
<P>
   Hard as it seems to believe, for most of the next 14 years the
NFL let him go begging. He signed with the United States Football
League, which planned to promote him as one of its marquee players,
except that it soon went belly up.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Flutie signed with the Chicago Bears as an insurance
policy for the injury-prone Jim McMahon, who had been feuding with
his coach, Mike Ditka. Two weeks later, McMahon wrecked his
shoulder and was lost for the season. The other Bears backups
accepted Flutie with good humor.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the Bears needed to design a special offense for
the 5-9 newcomer, Steve Fuller said: ``Yeah. The sawed-off
shotgun.''
</P>
<P>
   He was an instant favorite in Chicago, and by December a song
had been released celebrating his presence. Flutie, Flutie was sung
to the tune of Goody, Goody, an old Johnny Mercer number.
</P>
<P>
   The love affair in Chicago lasted a long time, nearly six
months. McMahon's shoulder healed, and the Bears drafted Jim
Harbaugh. Suddenly, Flutie was looking small again.
</P>
<P>
   The long and short of it was that, in the midst of the player
strike of 1987, Flutie was traded to the New England Patriots. It
should have been a joyful homecoming, but a few minor distractions
intervened.
</P>
<P>
   In the last strike game, in the absence of the team's regular
quarterbacks, Flutie led the Patriots to a 21-7 win over the
Oilers. The fans in the commonwealth loved it, but to his teammates
_ former and future _ Flutie was a scab. A little scab, at that.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Raymond Berry placed him fourth on the depth chart, behind
Steve Grogan, Tony Eason and Tom Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Time passed, unlike Doug Flutie, who mostly sat and waited. In
1988, he came off the bench to run for the winning touchdown on the
last play of the game as the Patriots beat the Colts 21-17. When
writers just happened to ask McMahon what he thought of Flutie's
comeback, he offered a tart reply: ``Who? Oh, Bambi. That was
great, wasn't it? He's America's Midget again.''
</P>
<P>
   When Berry finally made Flutie his starter, the Patriots won
four out of their last six, including a lopsided win over the
Bears. Flutie passed for four touchdowns. McMahon tore up a knee
and had to be helped off the field.

   It all should have been wonderful. The New England owner, Victor
Kiam, had made his fortune on Remington razors. Flutie was a bright
little shaver after his own heart. But in one of the cruelest cuts
of all, the Patriots let him go a year later. The computer in New
England had the same problem as all the others. Flutie's
measurements wouldn't compute. His critics were split down the
middle. Some said he was too short, and some said he wasn't tall
enough.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back, after eight great years in Canada, for the third
version of Pee Wee's Great Adventure. He is carrying the ball for
Davey O'Brien and Eddie LeBaron and Fran Tarkenton, all the guys
who played above their inches. All he ever wanted was a chance to
prove himself. He knew he could, if only they would let him.

BRITISH AIRWAYS SEEKING PHASED-IN LINK WITH AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After repeated delays by European and U.S. regulators, British
Airways said Friday that it would now settle for its proposed
alliance with American Airlines to be phased in over five years.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said that it was still committed to the alliance
but that a demand by the European authorities that the two airlines
give up 267 weekly takeoff and landing slots at Heathrow Airport in
London was too high a price to pay for immediate approval. Instead,
it would rather wait until other slots for rival airlines become
available after British officials allow more airlines to land
there.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators would still have to approve a phased-in alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, British Airways said, it will develop links
with American and other airlines in areas not requiring government
approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terms put forward by the European Commission are not
acceptable to us commercially,'' said Honor Verrier, a British
Airways spokeswoman. ``What we want is for the alliance to be
phased in over the next four to five years.''
</P>
<P>
   The alliance by British Airways and American, which together
provide 60 percent of all trans-Atlantic air service, would require
antitrust immunity so they could coordinate scheduling and pricing
of flights.
</P>
<P>
   Rival airlines have attacked the proposal, saying they would be
unable to compete unless British Airways and American were forced
to give them access to Heathrow. In an advisory opinion provided to
the Transportation Department in May, the antitrust division of the
Justice Department said the alliance would hurt competition and
suggested that the airlines be compelled to give up at least 336
slots at Heathrow.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chris Chiames, a spokesman for American, said American first
floated the idea of phasing in the alliance to Washington officials
in August or September.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines' new position is both a pragmatic response to the
long delay since the alliance was proposed in June 1996 and perhaps
an attempt to apply pressure on London and Washington to approve
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our sense is that both sides would prefer an immediate
solution to the problem,'' Chiames said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is using approval of the alliance as its main
bargaining chip to get the British to renegotiate an aviation
treaty and allow more U.S. airlines to fly to Heathrow. Under the
current treaty, only American and United Airlines are allowed to
fly there. The so-called open skies agreement would allow United
States and British airlines to fly to any destination in either
country.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, U.S. delegates walked out of their first
treaty negotiations with the British in nearly two years, saying
that the British positions did not allow for any progress. The
Transportation Department then canceled a hearing scheduled for
last Monday to review the British Airways-American alliance,
further delaying its approval.
</P>
<P>
   The delays are especially frustrating to British Airways and
American because other link-ups, particularly the Star Alliance
built around United and the German airline Lufthansa, have been
moving ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, British Airways and American announced a global
marketing alliance, called Oneworld, which includes Canadian
Airlines, Cathay Pacific Airways of Hong Kong and Qantas Airways of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways said Friday that it was eager to develop
Oneworld over the next year in ways that do not require government
approval, such as combining frequent-flier programs and moving
airport gates next to one another.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to putting pressure on British and United States
authorities, the moves by British Airways and American may give
some of their rivals pause.
</P>
<P>
   This week, U S Airways chairman Stephen Wolf, who is eager to
expand in Europe, called on Washington to renounce the current
aviation treaty with London to force a resumption of the
negotiations.

POLLS FIND SEVERAL RACES TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Md., N.C., Nev., S.C.)  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category `a')

<P>
   As Election Day draws closer, many Senate and governor's races
are drawing closer, too. Going into the final weekend of
campaigning, no more than half a dozen points separate Democratic
and Republican candidates in at least half a dozen Senate races and
a dozen governor's races, a spread that sometimes can be closed in
a last-minute rush of advertising and stumping.
</P>
<P>
   In a number of the races, the spread is even narrower and, in
fact, has changed little in the better part of a month.
</P>
<P>
   Following are the latest poll results from six of the closest
Senate and governor's races:
</P>
<P>
   -- In North Carolina's Senate race, according to a Mason-Dixon
Poll conducted Oct. 26 through 28, Sen. Lauch Faircloth, the
Republican incumbent, leads his Democratic challenger, John
Edwards, an attorney, by 44 percent to 43 percent. Two weeks ago,
another Mason-Dixon poll gave Faircloth a two-point lead, not
significantly different.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll, conducted after President Clinton's character
became an issue in the campaign, covered 827 likely voters and has
a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the Kentucky Senate contest for an open seat, a
Mason-Dixon Poll taken on Oct. 26 and 27 has Rep. Scotty Baesler,
the Democrat, leading Rep. Jim Bunning, the Republican, by 46
percent to 45 percent, essentially the same result found a few days
earlier by a Bluegrass State Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll, conducted after both candidates began questioning
each other's voting consistency in Congress, covered 823 likely
voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points.
</P>
<P>
   -- In Nevada's Senate race, Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic
incumbent, leads his Republican challenger, Rep. John Ensign, by 47
percent to 45 percent, according to a Mason-Dixon poll conducted
Oct. 25 through 27.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, when both candidates were struggling, as they
are now, to connect with the tens of thousands of new residents in
the booming state, another Mason-Dixon poll came up with
essentially the same result.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll surveyed 817 likely voters and has a margin of
error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the contest for governor in South Carolina, a Mason-Dixon
Poll conducted Oct. 26 through 28 found the Republican incumbent,
Gov. David M. Beasley, losing his edge over his Democratic
challenger, former state Rep. Jim Hodges. The governor had a
relatively comfortable lead of nine percentage points in a
Mason-Dixon Poll taken in late September, but in the new poll, he
leads by only two points, 46 percent to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, taken after a month of increasingly negative
campaigning, surveyed 806 likely voters and has a margin of error
of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. It indicates that the
undecided segment of the vote may be breaking toward Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the Maryland governor's race, a new Mason-Dixon Poll
indicates that Gov. Parris N. Glendening, the Democratic incumbent,
has inched ahead a bit in a tight contest with his Republican
challenger, Ellen R. Sauerbrey, also his opponent in 1994. The
poll, conducted Oct. 26 through 28, found Glendening ahead by four
points, 49 percent to 45 percent, about the same margin found a
week earlier in a Washington Post poll.
</P>
<P>
   But a week before the Post poll, another Mason-Dixon Poll found
Glendening ahead by only two points. And a month before that, Ms.
Sauerbrey led by a point.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Mason-Dixon Poll, conducted after the governor
accused Ms. Sauerbrey of being weak on civil rights issues,
surveyed 828 likely voters and has a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   -- In the Nevada governor's contest, where expenditures for
television advertising are beginning to set records, a new
Mason-Dixon Poll has the once wide-open race down to a dead heat.
The poll, which surveyed 817 likely voters Oct. 25 through 27 and
has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points, found the
Republican, Kenny Guinn, a former state school superintendent,
leading the Democrat, Jan Jones, the mayor of Las Vegas, by 47
percent to 44 percent. A month earlier, Ms. Jones trailed by 15
points in another Mason-Dixon Poll.
</P>
<P>
   The current governor, Bob Miller, cannot run for another term
under the state's term-limit law.

CHRISTOPHER GABLE, 58, BALLET STAR AND ACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain)   (bl)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Gable, an English ballet star who made an unusually
successful transition to film and theater, died Oct. 23 at his home
near Halifax in Yorkshire. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Anna Izza, spokeswoman for the
Northern Ballet in Leeds, which Gable directed.
</P>
<P>
   With his blond good looks and a sunny charm that telegraphed
itself to the farthest reaches of the theater, Gable quickly rose
to the top, though without much encouragement from the Royal
Ballet. He began his ballet career in the late 1950s and by the
early '60s was well on his way to becoming one of the most popular
and gifted dancers of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   He made his name playing adolescent characters like the cousin
in Kenneth MacMillan's 1960 ``Invitation,'' his first big role; the
poignantly tender young man in Frederick Ashton's ``Two Pigeons,''
and Romeo in MacMillan's ``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan created one of the great ballet partnerships when he
cast Gable with Lynn Seymour in ``The Invitation,'' a ballet noted
for its brutal rape scene. Ms. Seymour, like Gable a strong actor,
was a dancer whose passion and dark beauty were an ideal complement
to him.
</P>
<P>
   The two created the roles of Romeo and Juliet in the MacMillan
ballet, and though they were removed from the premiere cast at the
last moment and replaced by Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn, who
were considered bigger box-office draws, for many Gable and Ms.
Seymour defined and were defined by those roles.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath Gable's good looks and well-proportioned ballet body,
there lay an intelligence, warmth and seriousness that helped
propel him through the politics of the ballet world and into the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared as Lysander in Peter Brook's production of ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company and was
a member of the Royal Exchange Theater in Manchester for several
seasons. Gable acted frequently on television, most notably in Ken
Russell's BBC-TV film ``Delius.'' Gable also appeared in Russell's
films ``The Rainbow'' and ``The Boy Friend,'' where he played the
title role opposite Twiggy.
</P>
<P>
   Gable returned to ballet in 1982, when he founded, with Ann
Stannard, the Central School of Ballet in Clerkenwell. In 1987 he
was lured back to the stage for the Northern Ballet Theater
production of Gillian Lynne's ``Simple Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gable was soon pressed into service directing the endangered
company, building it into a major English troupe specializing in
dance drama. He continued to work with the company up to his death.
</P>
<P>
   A cockney born in North London, Gable was an unlikely candidate
for ballet stardom and often talked of his career luck. Forced by
his mother to take piano lessons along with the dance classes he
lobbied for as a young boy, Gable was simply placed in the most
convenient ballet school that did not require him to cross any busy
streets. By 11, however, he was accepted by the Sadler's Wells
Opera (now Royal) Ballet School.
</P>
<P>
   Gable's performing career began unpromisingly when he was put
into the Covent Garden Opera Ballet on graduation, though he soon
talked his way into the touring company of the Royal Ballet, where
he danced from 1957 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   He moved up into the prestigious wing of the company that
performed at Covent Garden in 1963. There he partnered most of the
leading ballerinas and made an impact in major roles that included
Prince Siegfried in ``Swan Lake,'' Colas in Ashton's ``Fille Mal
Gardee,'' Solor in ``La Bayadere'' and Franz in ``Coppelia.'' Gable
left the Royal Ballet two years after the disappointment over
``Romeo and Juliet,'' attributing his departure to his persistent
difficulties with arthritic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Gable was the subject of a 1989 BBC-TV documentary, ``The
Amazing Adventures of Christopher Gable.'' He was made a Commander
of the British Empire in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Carole; a son, Tomas; a daughter,
Emma; and a brother, Brian.

MICHAEL JORDAN'S REPRESENTATIVE TRIES TO BECOME A PLAYER IN THE
LOCKOUT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ By implying that unprofitable owners should consider
selling their teams, Michael Jordan angered 74-year-old Abe Pollin
on Wednesday. So much that Pollin, the Washington Wizards owner,
began yelling at Jordan in front of nearly 100 players and several
owners.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's role in the dialogue, though sometimes heated, was
looked upon as a constructive way for each side in the National
Basketball Association's labor dispute to vent its frustrations
while trying to salvage the season. It was also a clear sign that
Jordan, the game's supernova player, had interjected himself into
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   On further review, it appears he has interjected someone else,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think Michael spoke up partly because of our
conversation the night before,'' said David Falk, the agent for
Jordan and 39 other NBA clients. ``I said to Michael Jordan and
Patrick Ewing Tuesday night, `If I told you I bought four vacation
homes around the world and realized that I could not reasonably
afford all of them, and then I decided to raise your fees to 50
percent to pay for them, what would you tell me? You'd tell me,
``If you can't afford them, sell them.''' This is essentially what
the owners are doing to the players, asking them to make them more
profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Promising to roll up his sleeves and exert as much influence as
he can behind the scenes, Falk said he planned to take a more
proactive role in ending the lockout. It remains to be seen whether
his presence will be divisive or helpful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would challenge David Stern to admit that he made a
mistake,'' Falk said, ``to call the lockout off tomorrow and show
the American public he cares more about having a season than
penalizing the players and the fans. He should let the two sides
negotiate in good faith, instead of trying to break the will of the
players. When all is said and done, he'll see that this is a tactic
that was tactically wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Falk's comments Friday, Stern, the NBA
commissioner, said: ``I admit I made a mistake. But that mistake
was in 1995 with the second agreement the owners entered into _
because David Falk and the other agents helped submarine the luxury
tax agreements. As a result, we made an agreement that was
demonstrably riskier for the owners. That agreement was great for
high-end players and very bad for the middle-class player and NBA
owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``David suggesting we operate under those circumstances simply
isn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   With the league's most prominent off-court forces trading words,
lawyers for the NBA and the union are scheduled to meet on Monday.
Both sides are hoping to make enough progress for a bargaining
session on Wednesday in Manhattan involving the league's labor
relations committee and 15 to 20 players.
</P>
<P>
   As they try to narrow the gap on limiting the very highest
individual salaries and total revenue distribution, the two parties
are hoping to recapture the momentum of the past week.
</P>
<P>
   While all of November's games were canceled on Wednesday, three
ensuing marathon negotiating sessions involved compromise and the
loose framework of an economic plan for the next five years. An
agreement in principle could be less than two weeks away, said one
league official, which would mean the season could start by
mid-December.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is an intangible in the process, it may be Falk's
influence.
</P>
<P>
   He would not elaborate on his ultimate perceived threat _ to
create a new league through a partnership with the entertainment
giant SFX, which recently purchased Falk's company for $150
million. Beyond concert halls and amphitheaters, SFX owns a ticket
distribution company. But Falk did issue Stern and his constituency
a strong warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to blow up what we've created in the way of
progress,'' Falk said, ``but when billionaire owners show they want
to break the will of the players by direct economic power, then the
players have a right to break their will, too. There are ways to
exercise economic power. We do that when countries don't comply
with us; we cut off our ties in many ways.''
</P>
<P>
   With Falk's clout and prominence in the game _ besides Jordan,
he represents the All-Stars Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Alonzo
Mourning, Glen Rice and Vin Baker as well as young stars like Juwan
Howard, Allen Iverson and Keith Van Horn _ the agent has been
perceived as being an invisible hand that guides his players
through the labor minefield.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Falk became the ringleader of several disgruntled
agents who led a movement to decertify the union. His influence
helped to lead to both sides' abandoning a luxury tax on salaries,
a concession that averted decertification and the eventual signing
of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the power to combat whatever starvation tactics the
league employs,'' Falk said. ``The biggest misconception is that
I'm somehow running the thing. I've been in a trial for five weeks
and Billy Hunter has been doing a great job. I've barely lifted a
finger. Of course, I'm going to get involved now. I'd like to
devote all my energies to solving the problem. If not, well, other
opportunities exist.''

LATE GOAL NULLIFIED, REWARDING GRITTY PLAY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Rangers are not winning games this season with
finesse or style. They have borrowed a new look, have taken on a
different personality _ that of a blue-collar, hard-working team.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers played another gritty, physical match Friday night,
and once again they escaped with a hard-fought victory, defeating
the Carolina Hurricanes, 1-0, at Madison Square Garden. It extended
the Rangers' unbeaten streak to six games (3-0-3).
</P>
<P>
   ``It has more character,'' Coach John Muckler said of his team.
``We play more disciplined hockey and we play with a team concept.
That's why we are having success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the talent level, this team knows it has to play as
a team to be successful. I knew we would have a hard-working hockey
club because of who is on the team.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A young player named Todd Harvey has come to embody these
Rangers. There's no flash to his game, no flair _ just hard work
and loads of very hard hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last five or six games, we've been scratching and
clawing,'' Harvey said. ``We may not be the most talented team, but
scratching and clawing is always going to beat out talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night's game was not decided until an apparent goal by
Carolina's Sami Kapanen was discounted for a crease violation.
Kapanen tapped the puck underneath Rangers goalie Mike Richter with
6.8 seconds left in the game. Immediately, Richter complained to
Referee Mark Faucette that Ron Francis' skate was in the crease.
And after a few tense moments on both benches while the play was
reviewed, Faucette waved off the goal. It was the most exciting
moment of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was screened,'' Richter said of the disallowed goal. ``It
was a great play by them. I saw his skate was in when the puck was
going in. If you get that call once a year, you hope it's at an
important time.''
</P>
<P>
   Richter, whose outstanding play in goal has been the main reason
for the Rangers' six-game unbeaten streak, made several key saves
Friday night. In the second period, he denied Keith Primeau, the
Hurricanes' captain, with a sliding save through the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers took the lead midway through the second period when
Harvey, who replaced the injured Aleksei Kovalev on the right wing
of Wayne Gretzky's line, scored. The goal broke a scoreless streak
of 124 minutes 49 seconds for the Rangers, who played to a
scoreless tie against Buffalo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   There had been speculation that Harvey was put on the Gretzky
line as a deterrent, for in recent games Gretzky was abused by
opposing players. Muckler denied making the move for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever Muckler's reason, the chemistry among Harvey,
Gretzky and Niklas Sundstrom worked very well Friday night. Harvey
was the Rangers' most visible player in the game, throwing massive
body-checks, picking fights with players much bigger than himself
and contributing offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good game,'' Harvey said. ``I took a few hits and I
gave a few.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey's goal gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead at 10:05 of the second
period. His one-timer beat Carolina's goalie, Arturs Irbe, through
the legs. Gretzky set up the play, faking a slap shot from along
the side boards, then passing the puck to Harvey.
</P>
<P>
   Irbe, who shut out Chicago on Wednesday, entered the game as the
hottest goalie in the league. His 0.84 goals against average and
.966 save percentage were leading the National Hockey League. He
made 23 saves Friday night, but the one he did not make was the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Harry York, who sat out the Rangers' previous seven games,
replaced Harvey at center on the second line, playing with Adam
Graves and Mike Knuble.
</P>
<P>
   York, who was demoted before the season for refusing the
grinding, hard-hitting role assigned to him by Muckler, made the
most of his opportunity Friday night. York was causing havoc,
throwing his body around recklessly, several times losing his
helmet in hard collisions.

RARE ILLNESS STRIKES A GIRL IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Bronx teen-ager has contracted a rare and often
fatal disease, Eastern equine encephalitis, the first such case
reported in New York City and only the third time a person in New
York state has been afflicted with the virus, health officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The 16-year-old girl, whom the authorities would not identify,
has returned home after 12 days in a Bronx hospital. She has been
ill since late September, but her condition has improved, said Dr.
Neal L. Cohen, the city's Health Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's out of the woods,'' Cohen said. ``We can't speak to
whether she's 100 percent, or 90 percent, or so-and-so, but she's
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Medical literature indicates that this strand of encephalitis,
known as EEE, has a 30 percent to 60 percent mortality rate. It is
extremely rare. Cohen said there have been only 172 cases
nationwide in the last 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   A Rhode Island man died of the disease in June. The two previous
New York state cases were also fatal; the most recent was in 1983,
when the virus killed a 7-year-old boy from Onondaga County.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is transmitted by mosquitoes and wild birds and cannot
be passed from human to human. The mosquitoes that carry the virus
are not common in New York City, though two Long Island parks were
closed briefly in September 1997 when the mosquitoes carrying the
virus were found there.
</P>
<P>
   They have also been discovered in recent years in Connecticut
and New Jersey, and a 69-year-old man in Plainville, Mass.,
contracted the disease last year.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the potential danger was low, noting that the
mosquito season had passed. On Friday, he said, city officials set
four mosquito traps in Bronx neighborhoods and came up with just
one mosquito, but it was not yet known whether the mosquito was a
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The likelihood now is that with the colder weather, we may not
find any mosquitoes with the potential to carry this virus,'' Cohen
said. ``If there were mosquitoes that were carrying the virus, the
period of greatest risk of infection would have been last month,
not currently.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the weather gets even colder, it will eliminate even the
low index of suspicion we would have that there could be any
potential risk,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said the unusually mild winter and hot summer may
have brought the rare mosquitoes here. Other New Yorkers would most
likely have contracted the virus around Labor Day, if at all, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Bronx girl has been sick for more than a month, city
officials said they were notified of the diagnosis only Friday. In
addition to searching for mosquitoes throughout the city, Cohen
said officials would check hospitals for any other potential cases.
</P>
<P>
   Encephalitis, a swelling of the brain, typically starts with a
high fever, stiff neck and headaches, but often leads to brain
damage or death. City health officials would not provide any
further details of the Bronx girl's condition or identify her
doctors or the hospital she stayed in.
</P>
<P>
   There is a vaccine to treat the disease in horses, but none for
humans. Only the symptoms can be addressed.

KICKER SETS HIGH SCHOOL RECORD IN HARD LOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ O.D. Wyatt High School had rattled off 27
unanswered points to transform Arlington Heights kicker Tomas
Sanchez' national record-setting field goal in the first quarter
into an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in desperation, Yellow Jackets receiver Hunter Thoms
hauled in a finger-tip catch on a fourth-down, 25-yard touchdown
pass with one-minute, two-seconds remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 27-26, Sanchez took the field to attempt the extra
point, possibly force overtime and allow the Yellow Jackets a
chance at redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The score remained 27-26 in the District 9-4A game at Clark
Stadium on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed the ball,'' said Sanchez, a senior. ``I kicked
the tee. I tried to get under it and kicked it too high. I take
full responsibility for what happened. Print that in the paper: I
accept full responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Wyatt trailed 13-0, with Heights (6-3, 6-2) riding
the tide of Sanchez' historic 44th career field goal, a 44-yarder,
and his 45th, a 23-yarder with two seconds remaining in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt head coach Anthony Criss then walked into the Chaparrals
locker room and spoke of champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played the front-runner all season,'' said Criss, whose
team has clinched a share of the district title, while Heights has
clinched a playoff berth. ``What type of team are we? Can we come
from behind? Can special teams do this? Can the offense? Can the
defense? They never gave up. That's the mark of a champion _
overcoming adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt (8-1, 8-0) would have to overcome a 20-point deficit after
Heights quarterback Matt Jones hit receiver Matt Sisk on a 49-yard
screen pass for a touchdown to end the first quarter and Melvin
Polk opened the second half with a 95-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Chaparrals responded with an eight-play, 59-yard, all-Donald
Burrell touchdown drive, in which Burrell ran up the middle (11
yards), outside (17 yards), over Yellow Jackets ``and'' converted
on fourth down ``and'' finished his with an 8-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with three touchdowns, 112 yards on 19 carries and
31/2 tackles at defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   The Chaparrals forced a punt on Heights' ensuing possession,
which Wyatt's Darrent Williams returned 71 yards for Wyatt's second
touchdown after James White delivered a key block to clear his
initial path.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt then scored the go-ahead touchdown after Heights punter
Michael Lahoud fumbled the snap, allowing the Chaparrals to take
over on the Yellow Jackets' 4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   When Sanchez' line-drive kick cleared the crossbar with 4:11
remaining in the first quarter, officials stopped the game to give
Sanchez the game ball. The Wyatt bench emptied and the entire team
walked onto the field to applaud and congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud for my family and for my school to have my name
in the record book with Arlington Heights beside it,'' Sanchez said
after the game. ``But it's also bittersweet. It's a little
bittersweet.''

WILHELM KARMANN JR., 83, RAN GERMAN CAR-BODY MAKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilhelm Karmann Jr., whose coach-building company produced the
classic Volkswagen Karmann Ghia and other cars, died Oct. 25 at his
home in Osnabrueck, Germany. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   In 1901, Karmann's father bought Klases, a coach-building
company established in 1874, and renamed it after himself. The
company grew with the fledgling automobile industry, producing
bodies for Opel and Minerva, and after World War I, for Adler and
Ford.
</P>
<P>
   The Karmann factory was leveled in World War II, but was later
rebuilt. It provided body components and tooling for many European
automakers, including Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Renault, BMW and
Saab.
</P>
<P>
   It was, however, the relationship with Volkswagen, which began
in 1948, that established Karmann's place in automotive history.
The company won an early contract to build a convertible version of
the new VW Beetle, which remained in production until 1980. Karmann
GmbH today manufactures the Golf Cabriolet for Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Dec. 4, 1914, in Osnabrueck, Karmann got his start as a
19-year-old apprentice in his father's factory. He attended
technical school near Berlin from 1935 to 1937 and fought in World
War II, returning to help rebuild the family business. The
cornerstone for the Osnabrueck factory operating today was laid in
1949.
</P>
<P>
   After his father's death in 1952 at age 88, Karmann took over
management of the family business. It was through his friendship
with Luigi Segre, the owner and chief stylist of Carrozzeria Ghia
of Turin, Italy, that the Karmann Ghia came to be built. Volkswagen
had earlier asked Karmann to design a sports car on the Beetle
chassis, but had rejected all of the prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   Karmann mentioned this to Segre, who without the knowledge of
either Karmann or Volkswagen bought a standard Beetle, removed its
body and built the curvaceous design. He showed it to a surprised
Wilhelm Karmann in 1953, who in turn showed the car to an impressed
team of Volkswagen executives. The Karmann Ghia entered production
in mid-1955, and it was an instant success.
</P>
<P>
   The Karmann Ghia received a mild facelift in 1958, and it
underwent various chassis and engine improvements along with the
Beetle until it was discontinued in 1975. A total of about 283,000
coupes and 81,000 cabriolets, or convertibles, were built. Although
Karmann and Ghia introduced a more modern-looking successor in
1961, known internally as the Type 34, it was never as popular as
the original and ceased production in 1969, with only 42,000 made.
Karmann also produced the Volkswagen Scirocco and Corrado sport
coupes, and the midengine Porsche 914.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Karmann took over the family business from his
father in 1952, it had 1,452 employees and annual sales of $15
million. By 1989, the company had annual sales of $625 million.
Today, Wilhelm Karmann GmbH employs 6,400 people in Germany and
2,600 others in operations in Brazil, Portugal and near Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Karmann is survived by his wife, Christiane; his son, Wilhelm
Dietrich, who is a manager of the company; two daughters,
Christiane and Stephanie; and eight grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: FOR CONGRESS IN CONNECTICUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: The full text of New York Times editorials endorsing
candidates in next Tuesday's elections can be found on the New York
Times Web site, at www.nytimes.com/endorse.) (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 31:
</P>
<P>
   Here are our endorsements for some competitive congressional
races in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   1st District (Greater Hartford): Kevin O'Connor, a 31-year-old
Wethersfield attorney who became a Republican less than three years
ago, is giving the Democratic nominee, John Larson, a run for his
money in this traditionally Democratic seat. With the harsh
conservative rhetoric coming out of the majority party in the House
of Representatives, it is hard to pass up an attractive moderate
like O'Connor. But Larson, the former president pro tempore of the
state Senate, is a good candidate too.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of those rare leaders in the state Legislature who
had a vision that went beyond day-to-day politics, particularly
when it came to issues regarding children. He was a chief proponent
of family resource centers for preschoolers and the law
guaranteeing workers unpaid leaves to take care of new babies or
ailing family members. A moderate, Larson has demonstrated that he
has the temperament and political skills to be effective, even if
he is operating in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, on the other hand, has never held public office, or
even taken an active part in community affairs. Voters have no clue
how he would respond to the tugs and pressures of life in a
Republican Congress, whose agenda is on many points contrary to the
pro-city, socially moderate platform he adheres to. We hope
O'Connor runs for office again, but in this contest, our
endorsement goes to Larson.
</P>
<P>
   4th District (Greenwich to Bridgeport): Rep. Christopher Shays
is not facing serious opposition. The Democratic nominee, Jonathan
Kantrowitz, a businessman, bravely volunteered to run so that his
party could provide voters with a choice. But we endorse Shays, and
take this opportunity to praise his perseverance in the cause of
cleaner politics, even in the face of strenuous opposition from the
leaders of his own party. As sponsor of the Shays-Meehan campaign
finance reform bill, Shays did what most people thought was
impossible, forging a bipartisan coalition that passed legislation
to limit the ability of big-money special interests to influence
elections. The measure died in the Senate, but it will be back next
year _ as, we hope, will Shays.
</P>
<P>
   5th District (Danbury, Waterbury, Meriden and surrounding
towns): Republicans have targeted the seat held by Rep. Jim
Maloney, a first-term Democrat. Anticipating a tough re-election
campaign, Maloney has voted for several Republican initiatives,
including a proposed $80 billion tax cut, the impeachment inquiry
and the ``partial birth'' abortion ban. We disagree with him on
some of those issues, and we are also concerned about what seems at
best a sloppy attitude toward campaign finance regulations.
</P>
<P>
   But we appreciate his good work on environmental bills,
particularly his successful effort in concert with Shays to clean
up polluted industrial sites. He has also worked hard to improve
constituent services. His opponent, state Sen. Mark Nielsen, has
run an aggressive campaign. But he has failed to demonstrate that
he could represent the district better than the incumbent. We
endorse Maloney for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   6th District (Northwest Connecticut): This race is a rematch
between the longtime Republican incumbent, Nancy Johnson, and
Charlotte Koskoff, the feisty Democratic activist who almost
unseated her in 1996 by stressing Ms. Johnson's disappointing
performance as chairwoman of the House Ethics Committee during its
investigation of Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Ms. Koskoff, we remain dismayed by Ms. Johnson's role
in the Gingrich case, beginning with her inexcusable dawdling in
appointing a special counsel and ending with her unwillingness to
insist that Gingrich pay with his own funds the fine the House
levied along with a reprimand. But Ms. Johnson's tenure on the
Ethics Committee ended almost two years ago, and this term has
provided numerous reminders of the thoughtful, bipartisan approach
to legislating that has normally been her hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   She plays a particularly valuable role as a senior Republican
moderate trying to counter the instincts of a right-wing GOP
leadership on social issues like welfare reform and abortion. The
case for Ms. Johnson is bolstered by a practical consideration. In
light of Barbara Kennelly's departure from Congress to run for
governor, Ms. Johnson's defeat would leave Connecticut without a
senior representative on the Ways and Means Committee, leaving the
state at a real disadvantage in the competition for federal
dollars. Impressed as we are by Ms. Koskoff's energy and knowledge
of the issues, we endorse Ms. Johnson.

LIGHTNING STRIKES KINGS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Most teams in the NHL welcome Tampa Bay into their
arenas with open arms. After all, the Lightning has had but one
winning season in its six-year existence.
</P>
<P>
   But storm warnings go up when the Lightning comes to Los
Angeles. The Forum has become a home away from home of sorts for
lowly Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning, the NHL's worst team last season, picked up its
first road win of the 1998-99 season Friday by defeating the Kings
3-0 before 10,968.
</P>
<P>
   The victory improved Tampa Bay's record at the Forum to an
amazing 6-1 and completed a season sweep of the Kings. Los Angeles
dropped a 3-2 decision at Tampa Bay on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings offense, minus last year's leading scorer Jozef
Stumpel, struggling mightily, Los Angeles was depending on its
defense and rookie goalie Manny Legace in the team's first home
game since returning from a five-game East Coast swing.
</P>
<P>
   Legace, who came into the game with a league-leading .966 save
percentage, and the defense were doing just fine until early in the
third period when Sean O'Donnell failed to touch a puck and gain an
icing call.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings couldn't clear the zone and Daymond Langkow made them
pay when he bounced in his rebound shot off the shoulder of Legace
with 18:34 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   That goal and empty-netters in the final minute by Darcy Tucker
and Cory Cross, proved to be more than enough as the Kings were
limited to two goals or fewer for the seventh time in 10 games. Los
Angeles has scored more than three goals in a game only twice thus
far this season.
</P>
<P>
   After a snail-paced first period the action picked up in the
second, but neither offense could muster a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams came close, but Legace and Tampa Bay goalie Darren
Puppa made sure the game remained scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' Yanic Perreault had an open net to shoot at for a
moment early in the period after getting a nice pass from Vladimir
Tsyplakov, but Puppa went post-to-post to make the save.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's best chance came on a weak shot by Andrei Nazarov.
Legace had trouble controlling the rebound, but he bent over
backward to keep the puck from rolling over the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams combined for a grand total of one shot in the
first 11 minutes of the game. Luc Robitaille's deflection attempt
while the Kings were on the power play was easily gloved by Puppa.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay didn't record a shot on goal until the 11-minute mark
of the period when lumbering winger Sandy McCarthy, surrounded by
three Kings, finally forced Legace to make a save.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Lightning did get the game's first good scoring
chance when Rob Zamuner stripped Rob Blake of the puck in the slot.
The Tampa Bay winger whirled and put a backhander on net that
Legace stopped by flashing out his right leg pad.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Boucher and Robitaille had chances turned aside on Los
Angeles' second power play of the period, but the highlight of the
opening 20 minutes for the Kings was once again their penalty
killing.
</P>
<P>
   The NHL's top-ranked penalty-killing team extended its streak to
37 penalties killed without allowing a goal. The Kings have allowed
only one power-play goal all season.

5 ABORTION CLINICS RECEIVE ANTHRAX THREAT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Letters claiming to contain the deadly virus anthrax
were sent to five abortion clinics in three states on Friday,
sending dozens of people to the hospital and causing the evacuation
of a clinic in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary tests in at least two of the cities indicated that
the letters did not contain the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Delbert Culp, the president of Planned Parenthood of Central and
Southern Indiana, told The Associated Press that threatening
letters were received at clinics in Indianapolis, Bloomington and
New Albany, Ind. FBI officials said a clinic in Louisville, Ky.,
and another in Knoxville, Tenn., received similar letters.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Indianapolis Police Department said 31
people were sent to hospitals after the clinic there received a
letter containing a powdered substance the letter said was anthrax.
He said that tests were still being performed to determine the
identity of the powder, but that no one was complaining of
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the FBI in Louisville said preliminary tests
showed the substance in the letter received there was probably not
anthrax.

IN MARATHON, AS ON BROADWAY, DEBUTS CAN BE TRIUMPHANT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of the 32,000 runners in Sunday's New York City
Marathon, approximately 12,000 will be competing in their first
race of 26.2 miles. While many simply want to finish, it would
surprise no one if a first-timer won.
</P>
<P>
   While there is a history of runners winning their debut marathon
_ Emil Zatopek of Czechoslovakia won the Olympic marathon in 1952
on his maiden attempt _ victories by rookies appear to have become
more prevalent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In the New York City Marathon in the 1990's, Liz McColgan of
Scotland won her debut (1991) and Tegla Loroupe of Kenya won hers
(1994). At the Chicago Marathon in 1997 and 1998, Khalid Khannouchi
of Morocco and Ondoro Osoro of Kenya pulled off the rookie
equivalent of hitting a home run on their first trips to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Why is it unnecessary to serve a painful apprenticeship before
winning a marathon? For starters, legs are fresher the first time,
and there is little pressure and few expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1994, I didn't know what was going on with the marathon; I
didn't have any pressure, I just ran,'' Loroupe said. ``The second
marathon is when you begin to concentrate on the other runners and
everybody is looking at you.''
</P>
<P>
   The talent base for marathoning has broadened considerably in
the past 15 or so years, especially among African and European
runners. There has also been a proliferation of half-marathons,
which eases the transition from the track to the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early '80s, you probably had 15 people who were the top
marathoners in the world,'' said Allan Steinfeld, the race director
for the New York City Marathon. ``Now you have 30 or 40 people
running sub-2:10 since the Africans and Europeans came on board.''
</P>
<P>
   The marathon was once the domain of those too slow to run track
and cross-country. Or track and cross-country runners waited until
their careers, like autumn leaves, were fading before attempting a
marathon. But escalating prize money is drawing them to marathons
sooner and sooner. The men's and women's winners in New York will
each receive $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old thing was, you peaked at 28, then you worked up to the
marathon,'' said Amby Burfoot, the editor of Runner's World
magazine and the 1968 winner of the Boston Marathon. ``That was
always ridiculous. You run a great marathon when you're ready to
run great and train like a marathoner and you don't make the
mistake of overzealousness in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   McColgan won the 1991 New York City Marathon only three months
after winning the world championship at 10,000 meters on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be more to the idea that there are only so many
great marathons in you,'' Burfoot said. ``That's more important
than the idea of waiting. If you wait, sometimes you miss the
moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The first-timers with a chance to win in New York this year
include a raft of Kenyans. Peter Githuka won the Philadelphia
Distance Run half-marathon in 1 hour 1 minute 58 seconds in late
September. He ran the first half of New York last year as a
pacesetter and is the world record-holder in the eight-kilometer
(five-mile) road race in 22:03.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kariuki is the world record-holder for 25 kilometers (15{
miles) in 1:13:55. He and Githuka are training partners of John
Kagwe, the Kenyan who won last year's New York City Marathon.
Julius Bitok of Kenya, who has a personal best of 1:01:02 in the
half-marathon, is also making his debut in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to finish the race this year,'' Githuka said. ``I
want to win, but I know the course is tough. I don't think I will
go to the front like last year. You just have to wait, and maybe
you will have a chance. I know it will be hard and I will be
getting tired.''
</P>
<P>
   The marathon no longer seems to carry a sense of intimidation.
One of this year's top New York entrants, Anton Abel of Spain, won
his first marathon, in Berlin in 1996, the same year he competed in
the Olympic 10,000-meter race. He was the European champion at
10,000 meters in 1994, and was performing training runs of up to
18{ miles before he ran a full marathon.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of avoiding races while training for a marathon,
runners today are tuning up with 10-kilometer runs and
half-marathons. Thus, they are more race-sharp entering the
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more talent in the marathon than ever before,'' said
Dr. Gabriele Rosa, an Italian physician who coaches Bitok and other
Kenyans. ``Seven or eight years ago, there weren't many Kenyans
around. Douglas Wakiihuri, Ibrahim Hussein. Now look at the
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many predict the next great era of the marathon will come after
the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, when Haile
Gebrselassie of Ethiopia and Paul Tergat of Kenya make their
debuts. Gebrselassie is the world record-holder at 5,000 and 10,000
meters, while Tergat is the perennial world cross-country champion.
Some believe they can shave two minutes off the current marathon
world record of 2:06:05, set on Sept.20 by Ronaldo da Costa of
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you have athletes who can run 10K in 26 minutes instead of
28,'' said Rosa, who coaches Tergat. ``The future is coming. My
suggestion is that they can run 2:04.''

EDITORIAL: THAT DRUIDICAL FEELING 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, Oct. 31:
</P>
<P>
   To a child who grew up, as so many of us did, trick-or-treating
in small towns or quiet suburbs, where the sense of freedom was
offset mainly by the early darkness and the chill of the season and
the heavy odds that it was a school night, a modern Halloween feels
very strange. Costumed children troop about, if they troop at all,
in the late afternoon or early evening with their liberty sharply
curtailed, ransoming their innocence door to door, making cautious
sorties under the eyes of watchful adults. Meanwhile, what license
the kids have lost the adults dispense among themselves, turning
the evening, with some historical justification, into another New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween is clearly a festival _ holiday seems too forceful a
word _ in transition. There was an elasticity in rural societies, a
measure of their cohesion perhaps, that made the modest vandalism _
the bonfires and overtipped outhouses _ that was traditional on
Halloween acceptable. That is no longer true in most of America. In
a sense, Halloween was a moment of misrule. But as any
Shakespearean knows, misrule reconfirms the clear outlines of rule,
and those outlines, for better or worse, are not always
self-evident in modern America. The fact is that we no longer fear
the witches and goblins and spirits that are supposed to find the
atmosphere of All Hallows' Eve particularly congenial. We fear
ourselves instead.
</P>
<P>
   While for most people Halloween remains a largely unrooted event
_ a secular masquerade _ there is also a new historicism about it
as well, an attempt to reconnect Halloween with what little is
known about the practice of Druids on this evening. For them, it
was a turning point in the year, an occasion when all the souls
that had been trapped in beasts were liberated. Oddly, Christian
conservatives, who often condemn Halloween, seem to take it as
seriously as the silly, sober priestesses of Wicca, who resent the
warty caricatures of witches riding sidesaddle on brooms that
proliferate at this time of year. But just try to explain to a
6-year-old dressed as Pocahontas or a Ninja Turtle _ eyes glazed by
a saccharine daydream _ the druidical nature of the night ahead.
History lasts only as long as it takes to get home with a sackful
of loot.

D'AMATO AND SCHUMER COLLECTED MOST CAMPAIGN MONEY IN CONGRESSIONAL
HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By CLIFFORD J. LEVY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sen. Alfonse M. D'Amato and Rep. Charles E. Schumer,
who have long been among the most masterly fund-raisers in
politics, have collected more in campaign contributions in the
closely contested New York Senate race than any other pair of
candidates in congressional history.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato and Schumer have poured more than $33 million into the
election, often using money that they amassed from donors with
interests in Washington to buy strings of commercials back home.
</P>
<P>
   That total is the second highest ever. Only the 1994 Senate
election in California _ in which Sen. Dianne Feinstein defeated
Rep. Michael Huffington _ was more expensive, costing $44.4
million, but most of that was from the candidates' personal money.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of campaigns financed by contributions, the current one
in New York is the most expensive, campaign finance experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The spending on the race is even greater if the role of
organizations that are independent of the two campaigns is
considered. Political parties and advocacy groups have entered the
fray with millions of dollars of advertisements, trying to
influence one of only a handful of Senate contests this year in
which the incumbent is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   The spending by D'Amato and Schumer has been a crucial factor in
a grueling campaign largely fought on the airwaves. Each man has
had deep enough pockets to deploy new waves of commercials
promoting his own virtues, while purchasing others to mount and
parry attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this race, money is everything,'' said Jennifer E. Duffy,
who follows Senate elections for the Cook Political Report, a
non-partisan newsletter in Washington. ``For Schumer, the money
bought him the name identification. Let's look at D'Amato. He goes
into the race with terrible favorability and job performance
ratings. But the money just bought him the ability to define
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, who has traditionally relied upon a hefty bankroll to
overwhelm his opponents with advertising, has set a record for
fund-raising by an incumbent in this campaign _ $19.7 million, as
of the middle of the month, most of which he has spent. In his 1992
race, D'Amato spent $9.2 million to edge past his Democratic
challenger, Robert Abrams, who spent $6.6 million, most of it on
the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Collecting money for congressional contests is a relatively
arduous job because the limits are far lower than those for New
York State races. Donors can give a maximum of $2,000 to a
congressional campaign, as opposed to $41,400 for a gubernatorial
candidate running in the primary and general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, D'Amato has thrived. Since 1993, he has gathered more
than 25,000 contributions, an average of more than 80 a week.
</P>
<P>
   In Schumer, D'Amato is for the first time facing an opponent who
is as adroit at political fund-raising. The congressman, in fact,
appears to have adopted the senator's financial strategy: collect
money early and aggressively, focusing appeals on wealthy
industries involved in matters before Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer spent more than $13 million as of the middle of October,
less than D'Amato, but enough to insure that he was never off the
air, a problem that plagued Abrams, who found himself almost broke
the day after winning a rancorous Democratic primary in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato is finally in a fight with someone who is able to
stay in the ring with him for the whole 15 rounds and slug it
out,'' said Jeffrey B. Plaut, a partner at Global Strategy Group, a
political consulting firm not involved in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance experts say Schumer has raised more in
contributions than any other challenger in a congressional race,
with the exception of Oliver L. North, who spent $20.6 million in
his unsuccessful bid in 1994 to unseat Sen. Charles S. Robb of
Virginia, who spent $5.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another challenger this year, Peter G. Fitzgerald, an Illinois
Republican who is running against Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun, has
spent $15.3 million, but most of that is his own money.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato and Schumer have both specialized in Congress on issues
of importance to the financial services industries, and that sector
has been their biggest source of contributions.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato is chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, giving him
enormous clout over legislation that affects Wall Street. Schumer
sits on the House Banking Committee, where he is a member of the
democratic minority. He is far less powerful than D'Amato on these
matters, but has generally supported the views of investment firms.
</P>
<P>
   Several large firms _ including Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the
Equitable Companies, Bear, Stearns &AMP; Co. and Morgan, Stanley, Dean
Witter &AMP; Co. _ are backers of both men.
</P>
<P>
   People who work at Goldman Sachs contributed nearly $120,000 to
D'Amato and nearly $115,000 to Schumer over the last six years,
according to a tally by the Center for Responsive Politics, a
non-partisan group in Washington that studies campaign finance.

KINGS SHUT OUT AT HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ Most teams in the NHL welcome Tampa Bay into their
arenas with open arms. After all, the Lightning has had but one
winning season in its six-year existence.
</P>
<P>
   But storm warnings go up when the Lightning comes to Los
Angeles. The Forum has become a home away from home of sorts for
lowly Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning, the NHL's worst team last season, picked up its
first road win of the season Friday by defeating the Kings 3-0
before 10,968.
</P>
<P>
   The victory improved Tampa Bay's record at the Forum to an
amazing 6-1 and completed a season sweep of the Kings. Los Angeles
dropped a 3-2 decision at Tampa Bay on Oct. 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' said Kings coach Larry Robinson of his
team's record against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   But defenseman Philippe Boucher said the Kings (4-4-2) certainly
weren't looking past the Lightning (4-5-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``We struggled for a few years too and know we are good team,''
he said. ``They are a good team too and deserve respect. You have
to respect everybody, you just can't say you are going to go and
beat anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Kings offense _ minus last year's leading scorer Jozef
Stumpel _ struggling mightily, Los Angeles was depending on its
defense and rookie goalie Manny Legace in the team's first home
game since returning from a five-game East Coast swing.
</P>
<P>
   Legace, who came into the game with a league-leading .966 save
percentage, and the defense were doing just fine until early in the
third period when Sean O'Donnell failed to touch a puck and gain an
icing call.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings couldn't clear the zone and Daymond Langkow made them
pay when he bounced in his rebound shot off the shoulder of Legace
with 18:34 left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   That goal and empty-netters in the final minute by Darcy Tucker
and Cory Cross, proved to be more than enough as the Kings were
limited to two goals or less for the seventh time in 10 games. Los
Angeles has scored more than three goals in a game only twice thus
far this season.
</P>
<P>
   But Robinson, who at times this season has complained about the
Kings' effort level, had no complaints Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we played real hard,'' he said. ``For the most part
we had some great chances and (Tampa Bay goalie Darren) Puppa came
up big.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that does concern Robinson is the lack of depth at
center for the Kings, who were outshot 28-27.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are small down the middle and that's starting to show,'' he
said. ``That's where we really miss Stumpy. Our guys are getting
pushed away like little flies.''
</P>
<P>
   After a snail-paced first period, the action picked up in the
second, but neither offense could muster a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams came close, but Legace and Puppa made sure the game
remained scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' Yanic Perreault had an open net to shoot at for a
moment early in the period after getting a nice pass from Vladimir
Tsyplakov, but Puppa went post-to-post to make the save.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's best chance came on a weak shot by Andrei Nazarov.
Legace had trouble controlling the rebound, but he bent over
backward to keep the puck from rolling over the goal line.
</P>
<P>
   The two teams combined for a total of one shot in the first 11
minutes of the game. Luc Robitaille's deflection attempt while the
Kings were on the power play was easily gloved by Puppa.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the loss, the Kings' penalty killing remained almost
perfect. Los Angeles killed off four more penalties to increase its
streak to 39 consecutive kills. &UR; !end! &LR;  &QL;

KICKER SETS HIGH SCHOOL RECORD IN HARD LOSS

<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ O.D. Wyatt High School had rattled off 27
unanswered points to transform Arlington Heights kicker Tomas
Sanchez' national record-setting field goal in the first quarter
into an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in desperation, Yellow Jackets receiver Hunter Thoms
hauled in a finger-tip catch on a fourth-down, 25-yard touchdown
pass with one-minute, two-seconds remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 27-26, Sanchez took the field to attempt the extra
point, possibly force overtime and allow the Yellow Jackets a
chance at redemption.
</P>
<P>
   The score remained 27-26 in the District 9-4A game at Clark
Stadium on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed the ball,'' said Sanchez, a senior. ``I kicked
the tee. I tried to get under it and kicked it too high. I take
full responsibility for what happened. Print that in the paper: I
accept full responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, Wyatt trailed 13-0, with Heights (6-3, 6-2) riding
the tide of Sanchez' historic 44th career field goal, a 44-yarder,
and his 45th, a 23-yarder with two seconds remaining in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt head coach Anthony Criss then walked into the Chaparrals
locker room and spoke of champions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played the front-runner all season,'' said Criss, whose
team has clinched a share of the district title, while Heights has
clinched a playoff berth. ``What type of team are we? Can we come
from behind? Can special teams do this? Can the offense? Can the
defense? They never gave up. That's the mark of a champion _
overcoming adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt (8-1, 8-0) would have to overcome a 20-point deficit after
Heights quarterback Matt Jones hit receiver Matt Sisk on a 49-yard
screen pass for a touchdown to end the first quarter and Melvin
Polk opened the second half with a 95-yard kickoff return for a
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The Chaparrals responded with an eight-play, 59-yard, all-Donald
Burrell touchdown drive, in which Burrell ran up the middle (11
yards), outside (17 yards), over Yellow Jackets ``and'' converted
on fourth down ``and'' finished his with an 8-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with three touchdowns, 112 yards on 19 carries and
31/2 tackles at defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   The Chaparrals forced a punt on Heights' ensuing possession,
which Wyatt's Darrent Williams returned 71 yards for Wyatt's second
touchdown after James White delivered a key block to clear his
initial path.
</P>
<P>
   Wyatt then scored the go-ahead touchdown after Heights punter
Michael Lahoud fumbled the snap, allowing the Chaparrals to take
over on the Yellow Jackets' 4-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   When Sanchez' line-drive kick cleared the crossbar with 4:11
remaining in the first quarter, officials stopped the game to give
Sanchez the game ball. The Wyatt bench emptied and the entire team
walked onto the field to applaud and congratulate him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very proud for my family and for my school to have my name
in the record book with Arlington Heights beside it,'' Sanchez said
after the game. ``But it's also bittersweet. It's a little
bittersweet.''

TEXAS PREPSTER RUSHES FOR 525 YARDS (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, Texas _ Tyson Thompson has carried the load for the
Irving High School for much of this season. But Friday night in a
key District 6-5A game for both the Tigers and L.D. Bell at
Pennington Field, Thompson did more than carry the load.
</P>
<P>
   He bolted, shredded and rolled through the Bell defense for 525
yards rushing on 32 carries, scoring all seven Tigers touchdowns in
a 45-29 victory. Thompson's seven touchdown runs totaled 464 yards,
with his longest an 89-yarder in the fourth quarter. His shortest
touchdown was a 50-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in my offensive line and I knew
that (Bell) was a little weak in the cut-back lanes,'' said
Thompson, who has averaged more than 30 carries a game this season.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's performance puts him in some strong company in the Texas
high school record books. His performance was five yards better
than Sugar Land legend Kenneth Hall's best performance of 520 yards
in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a great back,'' L.D. Bell head coach Jack Gibson said of
Thompson. ``We missed some tackles and he took advantage of it. But
that is what he is supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's performance overshadowed a solid offensive outing by
the Blue Raiders. They had 350 yards rushing, with quarterback
Brandon Armstrong leading the team with 154 yards on 14 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson started the second half with his fourth score of the
game, a 53-yard run with 8:23 left in the third quarter. He was
stopped on the ensuing two-point conversion attempt, giving the
Tigers a 26-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Raiders responded, though, with a 14-play, 82-yard
drive that was capped with a 2-yard run by Yannz Mitchell. Adam
Thornton made the ensuing extra point to cut the lead to 26-21.
</P>
<P>
   But as Thompson had done for most of the night, he struck back
three plays later with an 80-yard touchdown run on third-and-10 to
open up a 32-21 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Irving defense forced Armstrong to fumble in Tigers
territory with less than a minute left in the third quarter. One
play later, on the first play of the fourth quarter, Thompson moved
through the Bell defense for an 89-yard score to put the game out
of reach at 39-21.

RANGERS SHOULD TAKE GAMBLE ON RANDY JOHNSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The word from Houston, home of pigeon-sized mosquitoes and amber
waves of humidity, is that the Astros want free-agent left-hander
Randy Johnson so badly, they are prepared to offer him $20 million
spread over two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Chump change, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   And Johnson is not likely to take it.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the baseball news of the past week. The New York Mets
just gave Mike Piazza a $91 million contract spread over seven
seasons. And I'd like somebody to tell me what position Piazza will
be playing in seven seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Another Met, pitcher Al Leiter, re-upped for a $32-million deal
over four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Four seasons. Seven seasons. Baseball is suddenly being run by
the Psychic Friends Network.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, therefore, are fooling themselves if they think
Johnson, at age 35, is going to sign for only two seasons, with
``make-good'' options for any more. Especially not if their
American League neighbors, the Rangers, would be willing to tie up
Johnson for longer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers haven't said that. But they could say it as early as
next week when general manager Doug Melvin visits again with
Johnson's representative, Barry Meister.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the franchise offer a free-agent fastballer a
lucrative, multiyear deal, though the pitcher is nearing an
advanced age? Because they've done it already, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow named Nolan Ryan. He was 42 when he hit town. And not
nearly so washed up as the Astros thought, as we all soon found
out.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin reiterated yesterday that signing shortstop Royce Clayton
remains the first piece of the club's free-agent puzzle. After
that, Melvin is expected to turn his focus to Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the plan apparently will include a phone call next week
to the team's unofficial, new recruiting coordinator. Fellow named
Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   The two _ Ryan and Johnson _ have been friends and kindred
fastball spirits, of sorts, ever since Nolan helped Johnson turn
his career around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get in touch with Nolan next week,'' Melvin said. ``But
the thing about these deals, I think, is that they all usually come
down to money. And if that's pretty much equal, it's where do they
want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Astros and Rangers, the Cleveland Indians, Arizona
Diamondbacks, Colorado Rockies, Anaheim Angels and New York Yankees
are all expected to prominently court Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland? Cold, bleak Cleveland?
</P>
<P>
   With a history of back trouble, Johnson can't seriously be
thinking about pitching on the shores of Lake Erie. It would take
him two months to warm up for his first start.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, April and May games at Coors Field would be
unscheduled shock therapy for Johnson and his once-herniated disc.
</P>
<P>
   He also wants to win. The Rockies can offer no sincere guarantee
of that.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels? Too unsettled. Too ... Disney. I'm trying to imagine
The Big Unit, squeezed into Herbie, The Love Bug, wearing his long
hair and mouse ears.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, the lingering unknown in the Johnson sweepstakes would
be the Diamondbacks and the fiscal prowess of owner Jerry
Colangelo. In the off-season, don't forget, Johnson lives in
Glendale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Good. Then he knows all about the sad-sack Diamondbacks.
Colangelo is committed to shortstop Jay Bell (.251 average) for
three more years and to third baseman Matt Williams (.267, 71 runs
batted in and 102 strikeouts) for four.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson is thinking seriously about signing with his hometown
team, he needs to ask: Who catches? Who plays left field? Why are
the D'backs in such a tough division?
</P>
<P>
   The National League West is so strong, expansion Arizona can't
rightfully guarantee Johnson that it will be a post-season
contender during his three/four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rangers can. New owner Tom Hicks' money suggests it so.
</P>
<P>
   Arlington isn't Arizona. But you can get there from here. As
Johnson learned in Houston, you can't live near work (the
Astrodome) and still be close to the airport. In Arlington, both
the Ballpark and a quick flight home to Arizona can be a short
drive away.
</P>
<P>
   It can happen. It doesn't help that the Mets bid against
themselves, in effect, and lavished uncharted millions on Piazza
and Leiter. Melvin is wise to be patient.
</P>
<P>
   But more than the money, it says here, the factor that
eventually sways Randy Johnson will be the length of the deal and
the team's proximity _ both to Arizona and the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is worth three years, and quite possibly four.
</P>
<P>
   The last similar gamble, fellow named Ryan, certainly seemed to
work.

LAST RIDE FOR RAHAL  
 SEASON'S END SIGNALS FINALE TO GRAND CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   They all say the same thing. They all say they'll miss the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Andretti said it. So did A.J. Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, Bobby Rahal said it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm going to miss the competition most, going to miss
that time when you take that corner better than anybody else could
have taken it on the lap, or you do that great qualifying lap or
you make that great pass or you bring a crippled car home,'' Rahal
said. ``I guess it is the sense of personal satisfaction that
racing gives you that I am probably going to miss because in
racing, you get that feedback very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just the fact of sort of meeting the challenge and beating it,
I am going to miss that part.''
</P>
<P>
   And racing will miss Rahal.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal, 45, whose ``Last Ride'' tour ends Sunday in the
season-ending Championship Auto Racing Teams event at California
Speedway, has pieced together a truly splendid 17-year career.
</P>
<P>
   Along with 24 career victories, which puts him at No. 4 on the
all-time list behind Michael Andretti (36), Al Unser Jr. (31) and
Rick Mears (26), Rahal will retire with a record 264 starts, the
first of which was made in 1982 at Phoenix International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal's 18 pole positions are fifth all-time, and with three
driving championships, he shares the record with Mears.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal gladly would trade a title for one more win, which he
hasn't achieved since 1992. But even if Rahal comes up short, which
is likely, it won't matter.
</P>
<P>
   It won't because memories can't be erased.
</P>
<P>
   And with Rahal, there are many.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most memorable moment occurred in 1986, when he won
the rain-delayed Indianapolis 500. As Rahal screamed across the
finish line, it was as touching a moment as there has been in any
Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   It was because Jim Trueman, Rahal's friend and team owner, was
dying of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won Indy for Jim,'' Rahal said. ``We knew he wasn't going
to be at the next Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``To realize someone else's dream was something truly special,
not just from my part but everybody on the team. I've never forgot
that morning. It's a little unreal, even to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   This season also has been special, such as when Rahal raced the
final time at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course, which he calls his
hometown track.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a race near Milwaukee that touched Rahal most.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that really hit me this year, frankly, was Milwaukee
after qualifying, when I got a standing ovation and there were
maybe only 3,000, 4,000 people there on a Saturday,'' Rahal said.
``But it took me totally aback. I just never expected that
whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the thing that has hit me is the fact that you rally
feel like you are connected with people after all these years,
that, yeah, you are out doing your thing, but in the process of
doing it, you meant something to people. That is the thing that has
had the most impact on me this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal also meant a lot to other drivers, notably Unser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby has been my best friend in racing with CART,'' Unser
said. ``We have so much in common. He's a college graduate, I
barely got out of high school; he goes to country clubs and plays
golf; I go to hunting lodges; he owns several car dealerships and
businesses, I make my snowmobile go faster; he has four children, I
have four children. Hey, there's something that matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, he's going to be missed on the racetrack for his
driver etiquette and as a competitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rahal hasn't won over his past 100 starts, he refuses
to throw in the towel. So, don't count him out Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people overstay their welcome, and I don't want
people to remember me as just going through the motions,'' said
Rahal, who will remain a co-team owner with late-night talk show
host David Letterman, fielding cars for Bryan Herta and Max Papis.
``That was very important to me, to have the good judgment to know
when to say when.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I haven't given up yet. I still have one more shot.'' &QL;

ROOKIE, DISTRACTIONS FOILED LAJOIE'S BID FOR 3-PEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No postseason victory banquet for Randy LaJoie this year.
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie, who was bidding for a record third straight NASCAR Busch
Series championship, won't even win three races this season unless
he sweeps the final two, beginning Sunday in Rockingham, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Entering the homestretch, LaJoie, 37, has one win and is No. 4
in the drivers standings, where he has no mathematical hope of
moving up.
</P>
<P>
   But LaJoie can move down, perhaps as far as eighth.
</P>
<P>
   So, what happened to the preseason favorite?
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. Ditto Matt Kenseth and Mike McLaughlin.
</P>
<P>
   Although a rookie, Earnhardt has won seven races, has 15
top-five finishes in 28 starts and leads the drivers standings by a
substantial margin over runner-up Kenseth, who has three wins.
</P>
<P>
   With two wins, McLaughlin is No. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some very talented drivers in this division,'' LaJoie
said. ``But we've also had certain things happen to us this year
that I can only attribute to (bad) luck. It's like we were at the
wrong place at the wrong time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The past two years, our average starting position was 12th or
13th and our average finish was like 7.8. This year, our average
start is 18th or 20th and we're not a whole lot better in our
finishing position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just kind of causing our own luck by not running well.''
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie also admitted there's been distractions within the team,
caused in part by him also competing in nine Winston Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie filled in several races for injured driver Ricky Craven.
</P>
<P>
   ``(My) car owners and crew chief were all for (the substituting)
at the beginning of the season,'' LaJoie said. ``Then, they turned
against it and I'm not sure why.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, well, I'm glad I drove that (Budweiser) car. I learned a
lot. When you run Winston Cup, it makes you a better Busch
driver.''
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't endear LaJoie to the team's hierarchy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything (the team's poor finishes) kind of got thrown back
in my face,'' LaJoie said. ``I didn't deserve it, and it's pretty
much why I'm moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   LaJoie is moving to a new team next season, one owned by James
Finch. The chief mechanic is Mark Reno.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is one of the sharpest crew chiefs in the business,''
LaJoie said. ``And (Finch) has been in the business for 15 years
with (driver Jeff Purvis). We've already started on next year. Mark
has four brand-new cars built.''
</P>
<P>
   As for LaJoie's Winston Cup experience, which included three
top-10 finishes this season, LaJoie said he's glad he performed the
part-time double duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good fix,'' LaJoie said. The three top 10s proved I
can run competitively in Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of people call me while I was there, but I told
them all the same thing. The Busch Series is a very good series and
I still enjoy my Sundays off.''
</P>
<P>
   Come next season, LaJoie is hoping to enjoy them even more. &QL;

   INTERNATIONAL (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-BIRTH-CONTROL (Beijing) _ China's family planning system,
notorious for the harsh rules and punishments it deploys in its
quest to limit births, has quietly started urging its workers to
soften their approach, hoping to improve its often tense
relationship with Chinese women. By Elisabeth Rosenthal. (With
photo, map.)
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-U.N. _ Posing the most serious challenge to the United
Nations in more than a year of intermittent crises, Iraq said
Saturday that it was suspending all cooperation with international
arms inspectors and would close down their long-term monitoring
operations immediately. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   LIBYA (Tripoli, Libya) _ Outwardly at least, nearly everything
on display in Libya these days seems calculated to project
defiance. And yet there are indications that the Libyan leader,
Col. Moammar Gadhafi might at last be close to accepting a
compromise that could bring an end to his country's isolation,
imposed for its failure to hand over two suspects wanted in the
bombing of Pam Am flight 103 over the tiny Scottish village of
Lockerbie in 1988, in which 270 were killed. By Douglas Jehl. (With
a map.)
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-SUCCESSION (Amman, Jordan) _ King Hussein's illness has
inspired those around him _ from his brother, Crown Prince Hassan,
to the loyalists who make up the government _ to concentrate their
efforts on one task: promoting the idea that transition, when it
does come to this strategically placed land, will be as seamless as
the king intended since anointing his younger brother as his
successor more than three decades ago. By Alan Cowell. (With a
photo.)
</P>
<P>
   ITALY-REFUGEES (San Foca, Italy) _ By day, this seaside resort
town in southern Italy is a shuttered ghost town, with fewer than
700 inhabitants in the off-season. At night, the population
mysteriously swells. When the sea is calm, as many as 500 boat
people reach the neighboring coast. Many of the fugitives from
Albania, Iraq and Kosovo are pushed or thrown from bobbing rubber
rafts by ruthless Albanian smugglers eager to escape the police. By
Alessandra Stanley. (With a photo and a map.)
</P>
<P>
   YUGOSLAVIA-PURGES (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ In recent months, as
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia was allowing his troops
to storm through the towns and villages of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, he was also conducting a quieter operation at Serbia's
universities to still the voices of teachers he considered
troublesome. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-IMF (Moscow) _ Seven weeks after it took office in the
midst of a deepening financial crisis, the Russian government
Saturday approved the first draft of a recovery plan that calls for
more public spending, and tighter government control of the
economy. The International Monetary Fund has already rejected the
preliminary plan. (Summary from wires.) By Celestine Bohlen.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-TROOPS-AGE (United Nations) _ Looking for greater maturity
and more experience in the soldiers it sends into peacekeeping
operations, the United Nations set minimum age limits this week for
troops and police trainers. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-U.N. (United Nations) _ Private aid groups, currently
sending millions of dollars worth of food and medicine to relieve
starvation and suffering in Sudan, are pressing the United Nations
to make a vigorous new effort to end the nearly 30-year civil war
there instead of merely feeding its victims. By Paul Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   PARIS-TRANSIT-STRIKE (Paris) _ Yves Sauz, a motorman on the
Paris rapid transit system, says he likes everything about the job
except the increasingly tough customers. On Monday, thousands of
the 40,000 bus and train drivers, ticket agents and other employees
of the French capital's municipal transit system plan to strike
back, with a work stoppage from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. to press demands
for better security in the face of rising violence. By Craig R.
Whitney.
</P>
<P>
   RWANDA-PROSECUTOR (Arusha, Tanzania) _ It was the gruesome
pictures of bodies and bones that caused Pierre-Richard Prosper to
give up a comfortable lawyer's life in Los Angeles for the rigors
of Rwanda, a war-ravaged country with unreliable electricity and
water. Prosper, a New York-bred lawyer, said he wanted to ``make a
difference,'' and he did.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   JEFFERSON-DNA _ DNA tests performed on the descendants of Thomas
Jefferson's family and of Jefferson's young slave, Sally Hemings,
offer compelling new evidence that the third president of the
United States fathered at least one of her children as has long
been speculated, according to an article in the next issue of the
scientific journal Nature. By Dinitia Smith and Nicholas Wade.
</P>
<P>
   NY-COPS-ABUSE (New York) _ The New York City Police Department,
critics say, has long been complacent in its approach to domestic
abuse complaints against its officers _ complaints that are rising
sharply. By David Kocieniewski and Kevin Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   TEAMSTERS-VOTE _ With ballots being mailed Monday to the
Teamsters union's 1.4 million members, James P. Hoffa is on the
final leg of a feverish campaign that could make him one of the
nation's most prominent and powerful union leaders. By Steven
Greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   NIH-BIOMED-GROWTH (Bethesda, Md.) _ The National Institutes of
Health used to feel like a bucolic college campus. Now it is a
giant construction project, with cranes and bulldozers erecting new
laboratories, a new research hospital and a new center for vaccine
research. The activity here is the tangible symbol of a huge new
federal investment in biomedical research. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   MASS-HOUSE-RACE (Danvers, Mass.) _ There is a certain feeling of
deja-deja-vu about the congressional campaign here, north of
Boston, in the 6th District of Massachusetts. The contest here is a
re-re-match between the Republican, Peter Torkildsen, the
district's delegate to the House of Representatives from 1992 to
1996, and John Tierney, its current congressman, who squeaked into
office by just 360 votes last time around. By Carey Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   OHIO-ZONING-HOLDOUT (Mayfield Heights, Ohio) _ Even though
Joseph Tomaro is the last, defiant holdout in a rural neighborhood
gone urban, he enjoys the serendipitous camaraderie that
commercialism brings his way. He knows the names of the office
workers who walk by his house and swaps news with the merchants
down the street. By Kristin Ohlson.
</P>
<P>
   ILL-ASIAN-BEETLE (Chicago) _ A small, black, tree-killing
beetle, first detected in New York more than two years ago, has
found its way to Chicago, where agriculture officials say it has
infested hundreds of trees. It is only the second known infestation
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-HOMESTRETCH (Los Angeles) _ A midterm election in
search of a moral drove toward a close Saturday in a final, frantic
round of television advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts and
coast-to-coast partisan bickering over everything from President
Clinton's character to health care and the safety of Social
Security for his baby-boom generation. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-IMMIG _ It is the weekend before the elections, and
immigration, the source of much national angst in years past, has
disappeared from the election debate, although not from lawmakers'
political agendas. By Mirta Ojito.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPAIGN-INCUMBENTS (Washington) _ This year's House races, more
than any in recent memory, are populated with challengers who have
been woefully outspent and are far behind. The fund-raising gap
between incumbents and challengers has grown to almost ridiculous
proportions. Of the 435 House races, 260 incumbents, or nearly 60
percent, have a 10 to 1 advantage in money. By Leslie Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ The candidates may be waging their
final campaign appeals over education, Social Security and tax
cuts. But the ultimate stake in Tuesday's midterm election is the
issue most congressional candidates have been trying not to
mention: the fate of President Clinton in the face of threatened
impeachment. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   N.C.-WATT (Charlotte, N.C.) _ Like President Clinton, Rep.
Melvin Watt is a graduate of the Yale Law School, and he ranks
among the President's most steadfast defenders in Congress. When
the House Judiciary Committee begins hearings on the impeachment of
Clinton, Watt, one of the most articulate of the committee's
Democrats, is expected to play a major role. But first he must win
re-election, which is no cinch, although he remains a slight
favorite. By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-STEELE (Washington) _ Julie Hiatt Steele is only a
peripheral figure in the investigation of President Clinton. But
she is still attracting a lot of attention from Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel. By Jill Abramson.
</P>

   WASHINGTON _ Rep. John Linder of Georgia, chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, perhaps said it best,
and certainly most succinctly, when he was asked last week which
issue was dominating the elections Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the prevailing sense of a fat and happy _ and uninterested _
electorate clashes weirdly with the dire, often despairing,
warnings from candidates that have marked this campaign season.
With undiminished fervor, politicians have been loudly proclaiming
one calamity after another, offering themselves as salvation from,
take your pick: the health care crisis; the education crisis; the
Social Security crisis; the moral crisis; the crisis in the
environment; the crisis in international markets.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot of this struggle to stir voters' souls seems to be
that voters are less inclined to stir at all. Forecasts of a
particularly paltry turnout this year may not stem simply from a
lack of compelling issues, but from candidates flogging the notion
of a sick nation at a time when voters seem to be saying that they
and their country feel just fine.
</P>
<P>
   Negative campaigning, the ubiquitous politics of personal
attack. is one thing, and it has been well noted by pundits,
pollsters and the like. But there is a different sort of negativity
issuing from federal, state and local campaigns, and it has been
less remarked upon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Candidates of both parties have been going out of their way to
manufacture crises where they just don't exist,'' said Dan Schnur,
a strategist for the California Republican Party. ``You can't
convince people to be frightened when they know there isn't any
reason to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians appear to have learned well the modern politics of
crisis _ from earlier hard economic times, the turmoil of the
1960s, the Cold War, ideological struggles over the welfare state.
But there is plenty of historical evidence to suggest that optimism
trumps pessimism in U.S. politics, from Franklin D. Roosevelt to
Ronald Reagan on down _ even to Bill Clinton, who won re-election
in 1996 with a relatively upbeat campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, voters were not roused by President Jimmy Carter's
earlier declaration of national malaise and proclamation of energy
problems so profound that they had to be attacked with ``the moral
equivalent of war.'' They instead turned to Reagan, who assured
them that America stood proud and strong.
</P>
<P>
   Remember Reagan's re-election drive of 1984? In one commercial,
lilting music played in the background. A bride and groom kissed
softly at the altar. The sun shone on San Francisco Bay. ``It's
morning again in America,'' the announcer said cheerily. ``And
under the leadership of Ronald Reagan, our country is prouder and
stronger and better. Why would we ever want to return to where we
were less than four short years ago?''
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that that was a fraudulent picture of America,
Democratic vice presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro said in a
debate with Vice President George Bush, ``Things are not as great
as the administration is wanting us to believe in their television
commercials.'' Voters chose optimism.
</P>
<P>
   There is always a risk of a candidate appearing too sunny when,
even in a time of relative prosperity, things are not perfect.
President Bush was defeated in 1992 in part because people thought
he did not demonstrate enough concern about the recession.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, 85 percent of Americans are satisfied with the
way things are going in their personal lives, according to the
Gallup Poll. And their satisfaction with the country in general is
unmatched since the euphoria just after the Persian Gulf war in
1991 (before things turned sour for Bush).
</P>
<P>
   ``The dawn is a lot brighter in '98 than it was in '84 for most
folks,'' said Gary Jacobson, a professor of political science at
the University of California at San Diego, comparing today to the
heyday of the Reagan era. ``It seems to me that's a message that
would sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many candidates cling to what they learned years ago in
Politics 101: The way to get through to voters is to scare them.
The problem is that while many people have concerns about this or
that issue, they aren't scared. It is true, for instance, that
education registers in polls as a big issue this year, but that is
not because people are unusually up in arms about schools. It is,
arguably, because voters cite education when they have nothing much
else to complain about.
</P>
<P>
   People surely want more out of their health care plans, but that
does not mean they think there is a health care crisis. They may
want more affordable child care but they do not necessarily think
there is a child care crisis. They may be troubled by teen-agers
joining gangs, but at a time of rapidly plunging crime rates they
do not feel under siege.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In countless interviews around the country, ordinary voters who
in previous election years bent visitors' ears with complaints
about a pet issue mustered only a collective shrug when asked what
most riled them this year. When the question was put to Gene
Provost, a 66-year-old electronics technician in Moreno Valley,
Calif., an independent, he replied, ``Do you have any issues in
particular?''
</P>
<P>
   Worried, perhaps, that nuanced or tempered messages may not
reach voters like Provost, candidates' messages verge on the
apocalyptic.
</P>
<P>
   In California, for example, the campaign of Democratic
gubernatorial nominee Gray Davis is warning that Republican nominee
Dan Lungren would ban abortion, something that no governor has
authority to do. ``We don't need someone as governor who would take
us back to the days of back-alley abortion,'' radio listeners are
told.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the Lungren campaign conjures up criminals running
rampant in the streets with California under a Gray administration.
Davis' support of the death penalty notwithstanding, one commercial
suggests that he would get rid of it: ``Davis Lobbied Against the
Death Penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   E.J. Dionne Jr., the author of ``Why Americans Hate Politics''
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1991), summed up the way candidates are turning
off voters. ``Politicians seem to spend so much time talking about
the terrible things other people have done and the failure of
various efforts to solve problems that they encourage a popular
sense that government can't solve problems,'' he said. ``It
encourages a lot of people to think that politics is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   It is true that challengers in particular would have a hard time
convincing voters to oust incumbents by announcing that everything
is rosy.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the most successful politicians this year have built
huge leads with messages of hope. New York Gov. George Pataki,
York, a Republican, is so far ahead in the polls that he can afford
a gauzy commercial with the message, ``Vote for the Pataki team
because the best New York is yet to come.''
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Democrat, has such feeble
opposition that this weekend her campaign put back on the air an
uplifting commercial showing her wearing a kid-sized Baltimore
Orioles baseball cap. ``Unlike a lot of politicians, she doesn't
have a big head,'' the narrator says. ``She just does big things
for the state she loves.''
</P>
<P>
   While such an optimistic pitch may carry broad appeal, it may be
less effective than a message of crisis in more competitive races,
where candidates are struggling to pull specific narrow
constituencies to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their target is the people who make up their minds at the last
minute and never think about politics unless they have to,''
Jacobson said. ``Maybe they still believe they have to get their
attention with a two-by-four. What we see is a tactic that strikes
us as excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, one problem unique to this campaign season is the
distraction of the White House sex scandal, which has made it
harder for candidates to get noticed and offered another
opportunity to portray a nation in crisis, in this case a moral
one.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Michael Deaver, an architect of Reagan's ``Morning in
America'' campaign, said he thought Democrats could do more to turn
prosperity to their advantage. Noting that Democrats ``are so
defensive because of the scandal,'' he suggested that more
uplifting messages could prove winners at a time when their leader
is popular and controls the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any party out of power should be talking about how bad it has
been,'' he said. ``But I don't know why the Democrats aren't saying
we're better off than we've ever been.''

   WASHINGTON _ Rep. John Linder of Georgia, chairman of the

ISRAELIS GET EERIE REMINDER THAT WORDS DO KILL

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Life in Israel has the jangled energy of a bad
traffic jam, and public debate is led by the guys who lean on their
horns.
</P>
<P>
   The volume is high, the emotions are high and the stakes are
high. Maybe that is why Israeli political discourse is world-class
vitriol _ one part rank ad hominem insult, one part invective-laden
rhetoric. One day, leaders issue witheringly insulting personal
remarks against each other only to join hands in alliance the next.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop comes an interesting and even poignant
sensitivity to the relationship between language that incites and
actual violence. The topic has dominated the public conversation
here for the last week, as Israelis have grappled with the idea
that their democracy exists in a special, fragile context that
might be at odds with their visceral impulse toward the freest of
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned from Washington
with a signed peace agreement, he has been the subject of rabid
protest and threats from the far right, particularly the radicals
of the Jewish settler movement. In demonstrations, on the radio and
at a funeral for a terrorism victim, the language used to attack
the prime minister has had a creepy echo for most Israelis. The
words are the same ones that were used against Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin after he brought home the Oslo interim peace accord
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Netanyahu has been called a traitor, a betrayer, a
perpetrator not only of treason but of ``a blunder unlike any in
the history of Zionism.'' Settlers have called for ``revenge.''
They blamed him for ``spilling the blood'' of an Israeli murdered
by a terrorist. And they used loaded references, comparing
Netanyahu's relationship with Yasser Arafat to Neville
Chamberlain's with Hitler, just as they once greeted Rabin by
holding black umbrellas, a la Chamberlain, over their heads.
</P>
<P>
   Three years after Rabin's assassination on Nov. 4, 1995, with a
nationwide memorial service scheduled for Sunday, this unnerves
people here because there is a lingering sense that this kind of
language incited his assassin, Yigal Amir _ that it roused him and
led him to believe he was justified in committing a murder on
behalf of the nation. And there is an unresolved guilt that no one
took the threats against Rabin seriously enough, not the
Government, the media or the General Security Services.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, all have decided that it would be more prudent
to risk overreacting this time. The ring of bodyguards surrounding
Netanyahu and his ministers has expanded and tightened.
Commentators noted that the General Security Services will let
Netanyahu visit Arafat in Gaza, but won't let him go near Hebron,
home of an angry Jewish settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Even the chief rabbis weighed in, publishing an official
statement on Thursday that prohibits the use of ``insults such as
traitor,'' terming them ``dishonorable to the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   And the attorney general opened several criminal investigations
into threats and slander, dusting off a legal statute that has been
on the books since the days of the British mandate. It allows
prosecutors to bring charges of incitement against those who use
particularly strong language against public officials, but, even in
the wake of the Rabin assassination, they were loath to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis, even as they fear prosecution of speech as a
bridle on their free-tongued society, endorse some kind of rein on
the vehement language of the protesters and on their right to
organize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without hysteria, and without giving up on the bedrock of
democratic government, now is the time to make use of the laws that
allow for the arrest, until their anger subsides, of people who
threaten not only law and order, but also the lives of the leaders
of the state,'' Yosef Lapid, a veteran columnist for the newspaper
Maariv, argued last week. ``The General Security Services and the
police need to take off their kid gloves and strike at the dens of
the inciters, before we are all sorry it was not done soon
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The discussion about words and deeds in Israel resembles one
that takes place in the United States and elsewhere when zealots
turn to violence amid an especially inflamed debate. That happened
in upstate New York last week after a doctor who performed
abortions was murdered.
</P>
<P>
   But in Israel the issue carries a particular double edge. A
commitment to almost raucous discourse is seen as a hallmark of a
society that considers itself the only democracy in the Middle
East. But Israelis have a deep-seated fear, based on experience,
that the connection between hate speech and violent acts is an
intimate one: In a Maariv poll, 81 percent of those surveyed said
they believe there has been incitement against Netanyahu and 60
percent believe it likely that someone will try to assassinate him.
</P>
<P>
   Underpinning this concern is a concomitant belief that the tone
is set from on high, by politicians who routinely call each other
liars, crybabies and cretins. Some have suggested that the ugly
language of the far right is just the end of a continuum that
begins on the marble floor of the Parliament. Justice Minister
Tsahi Hanegbi in fact, called on the Parliament to police its own
oratory, warning that the political debate sounds like that which
spilled out into the streets in the months before Rabin's
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have believed,'' Lapid asked, ``when the whole state
shuddered in the wake of the Rabin murder, that three years later
the public memorial service in his memory would be a security
danger for the public figures attending?''
</P>
<P>
   This carries a final irony, since some Israelis, notably Leah
Rabin, the late prime minister's widow, believe that it was
Netanyahu himself whose charged rhetoric created the climate of
incitement that inspired Amir.

   TOKYO _ They take pictures of her long thighs as she climbs into
limousines. They capture shots of her sitting in revealingly short
skirts, and they dub her the Madonna of the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   It is not exactly the most respectful way to treat Seiko Noda,
minister of post and telecommunications and Japan's youngest
Cabinet minister since the end of World War II. But, then, the idea
of sexual harassment is not foremost in the minds of the mostly
male Japanese media, particularly at the weekly magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain that working women have a tougher time in
Japan than in any other industrialized country. While there has
been some improvement in recent years, the Japanese government is
now trying to confront the issue by releasing new guidelines in an
effort to bar sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear gauge for measuring how common sexual
harassment is in Japan compared to other countries, but some
statistics are striking: One in seven women surveyed in government
offices said they had been pressured into a sexual relationship by
men at work, according to a recent official investigation. A more
common complaint, cited by two out of three women, is that they've
been sexually harassed by men touching their bodies at work.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines will go into effect a year from now at government
offices throughout the country, and they have also been drawing the
attention of Japanese companies, which have drawn up new _ though
much less strict _ rules as well. The result is a great deal of
grumbling by men (``If you say this is sexual harassment, then we
might as well not utter a word!'' one woman was told by a male
boss), as well as a feeling by many women that the rules aren't
tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Japan has fewer problems than the United States.
Sexual blackmail, in which bosses dangle a promotion or a new
assignment in exchange for sex, is not as widespread at large
corporations. One reason is that bosses in such companies have no
direct control over promotions, because all major assignments are
determined by a centralized personnel department.
</P>
<P>
   So even if many women find themselves under pressure to sleep
with their bosses, giving in to the pressure is unlikely to advance
their careers much. But whether they give in often affects the
kinds of tasks they are given. In many companies, women are mostly
on an ``office lady'' track, where they have few opportunities to
advance _ a limitation that perhaps reflects traditional,
discriminatory attitudes toward women that underlie the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are Japanese people who still think that women are just
cute and obedient,'' said Minako Nishijima, a senior official at
Nikkeiren, Japan's largest labor union. ``That kind of thinking has
been accepted without resistance throughout history.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan is not remotely a litigious society, and few women have
taken their complaints to court. Even if they win, the compensation
awards are tiny compared to those in America. ``In Japanese
society, people like to settle disputes as amicably and
harmoniously as possible,'' said Pauline Reich, a professor at
Waseda University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a fear of lawsuits has led many Japanese companies to
consider buying insurance that could cover them if an employee sues
for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In a society where the word for wife, ``oku-san,'' literally
means ``Mrs. In-the-Back-of-the-House,'' the government's new
sexual harassment policy marks a major new step. Under the new
guidelines, women in government offices can no longer be forced to
serve tea or run personal errands. And men will no longer be able
to ask questions about sexual experience, or show off obscene
posters or magazine photos.
</P>
<P>
   Still, attitudes will be hard to change. It used to be that many
women were under pressure to quit work when they got married. These
days they can work, but pressure to resign comes when they have
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Surprisingly, even at the age of 30, a woman can be called
`old,' '' said Yoko Nohara. ``And she can be told, `There is no
position for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   A 25-year-old college graduate who worked as a clerk at a small
distribution company for nearly four years recalled similar
intrusions into her private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those bosses would say, `Why don't you get married?''' she
said. ``If we take a holiday, they ask, `Are you having an arranged
blind date?'''
</P>
<P>
   Many men presumably think they are just being friendly, but
young women often resent such questions as intrusive. Many women
also complain that they are always the ones asked to serve food or
drink.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old employee, who spoke on the condition she not be
identified, said that at company dinners she was asked to fill wine
cups or soy sauce dishes, or to sing with executives if they were
at karaoke clubs. The guidelines, being directed only at government
offices, will not free employees like her from such tasks.
</P>
<P>
   One of the symbols of tradition in corporations, in fact, is the
tea service. At many companies, tea or coffee is served twice a
day, often to the desks of all the employees, with the women having
to remember who takes sugar or milk. There is also extra tea
service if there are guests or conferences. And there is all the
dishwashing.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, government offices may have to bring in
self-service tea time, if women no longer care to serve. Even
though companies won't be required to follow suit, perhaps a
similar practice will spread.
</P>
<P>
   At least one practice will disappear in government offices:
diminutive name-calling. Senior male managers often use terms like
``girl'' or ``lady'' to soften a relationship with an employee; now
that will be considered verbal sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   More sinister coinages will also be banned. Managers sometimes
refer to women by using a degrading term for ``daughter.'' Or when
they call an assistant to their side, they may not use her name,
her title or Miss. Instead, they often simply call out, ``Hey, she!
Come here!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it works both ways, and under the new guidelines,
women will not be able to mock men, challenging their masculinity
by saying things like, ``You lack guts even though you are a man.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The European Space Agency labored in obscurity for many years,
achieving dozens of feats in the heavens that were ignored by most
Europeans. Then, in 1983, Europe's first astronaut soared into
space aboard a shuttle. Suddenly, millions of television viewers
across the continent were glued to their sets, watching a
good-looking European explorer risk life and limb on the high
frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the agency's headquarters in Paris were ecstatic.
Eager for more, they quickly got the same religion as their
counterparts in America, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, which long ago had mastered the art of promoting
space-age heroism.
</P>
<P>
   Belatedly, the Europeans discovered that public enthusiasm for
sending people into space, a venture steeped in risk and danger,
drama and the right stuff, was a sure way to win political support
for space exploration and its great costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago nobody would have dreamed of actively pursuing
this kind of program,'' Jacques Collet, the head of long-term
planning for the European Space Agency, said shortly after the
televised coup prompted the agency to plan dozens of astronaut
flights.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the agency's officials turned out in force at Cape
Canaveral, Fla., for another lesson in space-agency showmanship as
NASA skillfully orchestrated both a high-stakes drama and a
world-class nostalgia trip by sending 77-year-old John Glenn back
into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   For Glenn's flight aboard the space shuttle Discovery, NASA
succeeded in drawing to Florida an estimated 250,000 people and one
of the largest contingents of journalists (2,500) ever to cover a
space launching. But even on slow days, the agency has managed to
turn the Kennedy Space Center into a top tourist attraction, with
tour buses and souvenir shops, its attendance somewhere behind that
of Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's public-affairs and educational arms, with hundreds of
employees coast to coast after 40 years of growth, are the envy of
other federal agencies. They give tours, publish magazines, set up
satellite feeds for television networks, develop course material
for teachers, run Internet Web sites, promote high-tech gadgetry
and regularly hustle out astronauts to meet an admiring public.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say NASA's celebrity culture and love of the
entertainment side of exploration are stifling the more challenging
work of sending humans and robotic probes to study distant worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an agency that's living in the past,'' said Alex
Roland, a former NASA historian who heads the history department at
Duke University. ``They're endlessly repeating the Apollo formula _
sending up astronauts, taking pictures and then sending them out on
lecture tours.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the shuttle flights always have a hefty dose of legitimate
science. In this case, it is aging research with Glenn, and dozens
of other experiments.
</P>
<P>
   But science aside, NASA is heavy with television crews and
telegenic space voyagers, and it knows exactly how to go about
building a political constituency to support its hefty budget,
which at $13.7 billion this year is down from old heights.
</P>
<P>
   So do a growing number of space agencies around the world that
are happy to follow the leader and grab onto NASA's lavish
coattails; the shuttles alone have cost American taxpayers some $70
billion so far.
</P>
<P>
   Last week at Cape Canaveral, scores of Spanish journalists and
television crews, as well as the crown prince of Spain and other
dignitaries, joined in the frenzy to witness the launching not only
of Glenn but also of Spain's first astronaut, Pedro Duque, 35, an
engineer from Madrid who, according to his NASA biography, enjoys
swimming and cycling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's neat to see everybody jump on the excitement bandwagon,''
said Joel Wells, a spokesman at the Kennedy Space Center, referring
to the journalists, ``and hopefully they'll stay.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising the adrenalin levels of Americans can be difficult these
days because the public has become so blase, especially since the
astronauts do the same old thing _ circle the Earth. Still, as the
Glenn extravaganza suggests, the space agency has some innovations
likely to jack up the thrills and chills _ if not satisfy critics.
</P>
<P>
   As NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin put it delicately in
announcing the senator's flight: The agency is working hard these
days not only to benefit but ``inspire people.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the razzmatazz can backfire. A dozen years ago, the
agency wanted to inspire people by enlisting the first private
citizen, Christa McAuliffe, a high school teacher. Among the 2,500
guests NASA invited to the launching of the Challenger space
shuttle were 112 teacher finalists from the competition, two from
each state and territory, who were to fan out afterward to spread
the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   After tragedy struck, killing all seven astronauts aboard the
Challenger, Glenn joined the experts saying the risks of space
flight should bar civilians and celebrities until the shuttle had
proven itself more reliable. ``This is not a Greyhound bus going
from Washington to Columbus,'' he told reporters. ``This is a
research vehicle.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Today, convinced that the shuttles are safer, NASA is revamping
its star system. When the agency announced the Glenn flight in
January, it also disclosed that Barbara Morgan, an elementary
school teacher who trained as a backup for the Challenger flight,
would get a new chance. Her astronaut class is to graduate in the
year 2000, after which she will be assigned to a flight and no
doubt broadcast lessons to schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that the biggest show on the horizon is the
International Space Station, an outpost bigger than a football
field that teams of astronauts are to build, service and repair.
The first supply flight for the station's construction is set for
later this month.
</P>
<P>
   The endeavor will be extremely dangerous for those sent into
orbit, given the station's size, complexity and all the space
walks. The outpost's size alone makes it a huge target for
asteroids and space debris.
</P>
<P>
   But given the thrill factor, and NASA's diplomatic salesmanship,
the space station is already an international hit. Its 16
participants are Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany,
Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, Britain and the United States. Most of the countries
expect their astronauts to join in a nearly endless series of
broadcasts and dramas from space that could start as early as next
year as the first modules are assembled in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics fear that the $50 billion project will cripple more
worthy missions, including robotic ones. Others fault it as far too
timid, arguing that manned missions should push for Mars and
beyond, perhaps to the Jovian moon Europa, which shows signs of
harboring the solar system's deepest ocean and perhaps alien life.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bruce Murray, a scientist at the California Institute of
Technology and president of the Planetary Society, a private group
in Pasadena that backs space exploration, disagreed. He said the
station, by uniting former enemies and galvanizing worldwide
interest, is a potent political and technical first step toward the
exploration and colonization of other worlds.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's public-relations campaign, he added, should be no
distraction from the serious scientific and technical aims of the
shuttle and station programs, nor from legitimate yearnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drama of humans going away is terribly appealing,'' Murray
said. ``That's why there's all this interest in Glenn. He's going
out in space. You can't overestimate the significance of that.''

<P>
   HOUSTON _ It was during the oil embargo era of the 1970s that
Patricia Nelson Limerick, who is now a leading historian of the
American West, announced to her students at Yale that Americans'
outlook and behavior had gone through a momentous change. No more
vistas of limitless resources. No more endlessly rising
consumption. The Era of Scarcity had begun.
</P>
<P>
   To save fuel and emphasize her belief, Ms. Limerick got around
by bicycle, train and bus.
</P>
<P>
   But 25 years later, Americans are consuming about as much energy
as ever. By next year, the Energy Department predicts consumption
per person will come to within 2 percent of the 1973 peak.
Americans are living in bigger homes crammed with more appliances
and driving larger, more powerful cars and more light trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Limerick is still riding buses. But she admits she got the
broader pattern wrong. ``I was quite a sucker,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Far from illustrating a transformation in American character,
the nation's heavy and rising use of its most basic fuels
illustrates consistencies. The distinctions between America and
most other advanced nations endure.
</P>
<P>
   As the 19th-century American historian Frederick Jackson Turner
famously said, the frontier set America apart from its European
forebears. For Americans, there was always more land, food and
fortune out there for the grabbing.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Census Bureau declared the frontier closed more than
a century ago, in many ways it remains open. Americans have gone
back to using energy as if it were limitless _ consuming far more
per person than Asians or Europeans. Only Canadians, with more
heavy industry and more chilblains, consume more. Low energy prices
are regarded as a part of the Bill of Rights. Politicians who try
to tax or otherwise raise the cost of fuel anywhere near the levels
in Europe are summarily rebuked.
</P>
<P>
   The wide open frontier still lives in the naming and advertising
of pickups and sports utility vehicles. Americans venture forth in
their Blazers, Explorers and Durangos. In commercials these trucks
rumble over endless stretches of Western highway.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionist historians like Ms. Limerick point out that Western
settlement also included official repression of Indians and other
minorities, the ravaging of the environment and a culture of
violence. Revisionist Western states and cities that once welcomed
mining and development are now trying to clean up pollution from
those mines and control urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   America's pattern of settlement, more dispersed than in most
other advanced nations, locks in the need for cheap, abundant
energy. But underneath the roar of factory machinery, home
construction and expressway traffic is the clang of a moral clash.
</P>
<P>
   Half the nation's oil is imported. Scientists caution that
emissions from rising energy use aggravate global warming. But ever
since proto-environmentalists warned of timber depletion in the
1870s, Americans have learned to doubt the need for conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Within the country, energy use varies greatly. New Yorkers and
Hawaiians are practically foreigners, merely sipping fuel while
Alaskans and Texans guzzle it. The average Alaskan uses more than
five times as much energy as the New Yorker, who uses the least;
the Texan burns more than two and a half times as much.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of heavy industry accounts for the greatest
differences. Louisiana and Texas, besides having plenty of oil
wells, are home to the chemical and refining businesses. Alaska and
Wyoming produce great quantities of oil, coal and natural gas,
especially in proportion to their populations.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, smokestacks and drilling rigs are few but subway
and taxi riders many. New Yorkers are also more apt than other
Americans to live jammed into apartments whose energy demands are
far lower than for houses. And with common walls, says Arthur
Rypinski, an Energy Department economist, ``You get to share your
neighbor's heating and cooling.'' As for Hawaii, it counts more on
tourism and pineapples than on petrochemical plants, and has far
lower heating bills than Wyoming or Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1970s embargo era, Texans, who considered their state
an honorary member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, were never shy about letting Northerners know who had
the most fuel. Bumper stickers on their Lincoln Continentals and
long-bed pickups said, ``Let the Yankees Freeze in the Dark.''
</P>
<P>
   With oil prices so low, perhaps Texans should mount a gracious
campaign assuring New Yorkers they are welcome to every drop Texas
has.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the conflict between the energy-hungry life style
and energy-saving impulses extends to the White House. At his
conference on global warming in October 1997, President Clinton
confessed his doubts about how much the nation could alter its
ways. Or even how much he could change his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm plagued by the example of the light bulb I have in my
living room of the White House that I read under at night,''
Clinton said, ``and I ask myself, `Why isn't every light bulb in
the White House like this?''' The lighting in question was a
readily available, compact fluorescent bulb whose longer life and
energy efficiency pay for its initial high cost several times over.
``Why are we not all doing this?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a battle many Americans agree is worth fighting but
don't want to fight themselves, the Clinton administration has
proposed hiring hungry foreign mercenaries. Through trading in
emissions rights, the White House plans to pay developing countries
to achieve about three-fourths of America's reductions required
under last year's Kyoto accord.
</P>
<P>
   Europe and Japan have howled that this plan violates that
accord, at least in spirit. They must be cranky from having to
drive such tiny cars.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A midterm election in search of a moral drove
toward a close on Saturday in a final, frantic round of television
advertisements, get-out-the-vote efforts and coast-to-coast
partisan bickering over everything from President Clinton's
character to health care and the safety of Social Security for his
baby-boom generation.
</P>
<P>
   With 36 governorships, 34 Senate seats and all 435 seats in the
House of Representatives at stake, neither national party entered
the final 72 hours willing to predict major gains or losses in an
electoral season that has seen repeated reversals of field and has
often seemed overshadowed in Washington by the drama of an
impending impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is that we're headed for a pretty low to modest
turnout,'' said Mary Crawford, communications director for the
National Republican Congressional Committee in Washington.
``There's not an overarching national event or situation that is
propelling people, just real solid, good, hand-to-hand combat going
on in these competitive individual districts. But there's not that
national oomph, if you will.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no shortage of hotly contested races, including
a half-dozen Senate seats, a dozen governorships and two dozen
especially close House races that most experts now believe could
wind up producing a net gain of a handful of seats for Republicans
as that body begins a full-dress impeachment inquiry next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're feeling is that there are 20 to 30 races that are
extremely close right now, a number of which will be decided by
1,000 to 2,000 votes,'' said Daniel Sallick, the spokesman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``Right now, beyond
that, we're not making any predictions.''
</P>
<P>
   From California, where Sen. Barbara Boxer, the incumbent
Democrat, has struggled to pull ahead of her Republican challenger,
state Treasurer Matt Fong, to New York, where Sen. Alphonse D'Amato
remains locked in a neck-and-neck race with his Democratic
challenger, Rep. Charles Schumer, the airwaves were filled with the
invective of last-minute advertising.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Democratic incumbent, Sen. Carol Moseley-Braun of
Illinois, appears to trail badly behind her Republican challenger,
state Sen. Peter Fitzgerald, but the prospect that Republicans
might win a filibuster-proof majority of 60 seats in the Senate has
receded in recent days as Democratic candidates like Boxer and Sen.
Patty Murray of Washington have pulled ahead and Sen. Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina appears to have rallied.
</P>
<P>
   With 18 incumbent Republican governors, compared with just six
Democrats and one independent, the Republicans hold a pronounced
advantage in races for governorships, but perhaps no single prize
is more important than California, with control of redistricting
its 52-member congressional delegation at stake in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And here the Democratic nominee, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, now holds
a double-digit lead over his Republican opponent, state Attorney
General Dan Lungren, in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you assume that the House is going to remain pretty closely
divided, the Democrats can easily gain six House seats here in the
next election, just by moving a few lines around after the next
census,'' said Tony Quinn, a Republican redistricting expert in
Sacramento. ``That can help them balance off what would be losses
in other states. That's why the prize here is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrogate campaigners, like Hillary Rodham Clinton, who raced
from fund-raisers here on Friday for Boxer to rallies in Chicago on
Saturday, fanned out with one last round of election messages.
Through all the vicissitudes of her husband's presidency, Mrs.
Clinton has held a galvanic appeal for Democratic women and
minority voters especially, and at a rally in Beverly Hills on
Friday night she was ablaze.
</P>
<P>
   As a heckler interrupted the reception at the Beverly-Wilshire
Hotel, Mrs. Clinton kept speaking calmly about the need to
``support public education'' and ``quality health care,'' but then,
as the crowd cheered, she fairly shouted, ``We have to be sure that
the people who do cheer for us get out and vote, so we protect our
values.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans were conceding nothing in the war over values.
In the party's weekly response to the president's radio address on
Saturday, Rep. John Ensign of Nevada, who is locked in a tight
challenge to Sen. Harry Reid there, took credit for the Republicans
for balancing the federal budget, overhauling the Internal Revenue
Service, and cutting taxes and Medicare waste, and he promised his
party would ``save Social Security.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a party of compassion for those who cannot care for
themselves,'' Ensign said, ``but a party of zero tolerance for
those who commit violence, threaten our communities and prey on the
small and weak.''
</P>
<P>
   As the national Republican Party unleashed commercials in
selected districts revisiting Clinton's deceptions about his
involvement with Monica Lewinksy in hopes of adding 10 to 15 seats
to its 228-to-207 seat advantage in the House, the Democratic Party
responded with advertisements of its own, mocking the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeing a lot of evidence that their ads are having
the desired effect,'' said Laura Nichols, press secretary to the
House Democratic leader, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri, ``in part
because those ads have been very hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Crawford of the Republican Congressional Committee
contended that the commercials aimed to draw a larger moral
contrast between the parties' ideas. She added, ``If you didn't
acknowledge that the scandal exists, your message seems phony,
because in this political environment it hangs so heavy, which is
why people are tired of it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Around the nation, polls showed that voters were apparently
prepared to send mixed messages. The incumbent Republican governors
of two of the biggest states, George Pataki of New York and George
W. Bush of Texas, seemed poised for blowout victories. In Florida,
Bush's brother Jeb leads his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Buddy
McKay, but by a smaller margin.
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush has said he is ``running like I'm 10 points down,'' and
last week he ran a series of television commercials warning elderly
voters against possible intimidation by the McKay campaign _
attacks that McKay denounced as scare tactics.
</P>
<P>
   But in California, a new statewide poll by the Field Institute
in San Francisco showed Davis holding a 14-point lead, 53 percent
to 39 percent, over Lungren, and Davis said he was ``so pleased to
be on the threshold of what could be a great victory for every
Democrat on the ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wisconsin, the incumbent Democratic senator, Russell
Feingold, a vocal supporter of campaign-finance overhaul, has
rejected help from his national party and as a result is in a fight
for his life, facing perhaps $2 million in advertising and direct
mail by the Republican National Senatorial Committee intended to
help his challenger, Rep. Mark Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, both candidates are to take their campaigns to the
parking lots of Lambeau Field in Green Bay, where Speaker Newt
Gingrich is to appear at a pre-Packers' game rally for Neumann.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Republican hopes for winning a second Senate seat
in Clinton's home state of Arkansas appeared to have fizzled.
Former Rep. Blanche Lambert Lincoln held a 20-point lead over her
opponent, State Sen. Fay Boozman, in a recent Mason-Dixon poll on
the race to succeed the retiring Democratic incumbent, Dale
Bumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seat is simply not in play anymore,'' said Dr. Cal
Ledbetter, a retired professor of political science at the
University of Arkansas at Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, independent analysts said, neither party appears to have
strong momentum at the season's end, though the consensus appeared
to be that the Republicans diminished the gains they had made in
the wake of Clinton's Aug. 17 confession of his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky by their handling of the material in Kenneth Starr's
report on possible impeachable offenses.

   ``We do not see this as a `backlash' against Republicans per
se,'' wrote the editors of The Cook Report, a non-partisan
political newsletter in Washington. ``That seems far too strong a
word. Instead it appears that House Republicans once again
overplayed their hand, forfeiting a rather substantial advantage,
and now have to settle for only a slight one.''

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ ``Divide and conquer'' is an ancient tactic
that Saddam Hussein refined into an art form as a dictator in Iraq.
Now, it seems, it has done him good service in aggravating the
United States and its one-time allies as they struggle to keep him
in the corner where they put him after the Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it seems, there are mostly divisions in the
complicated apparatus designed to prevent him from acquiring new
weapons of mass destruction or the economic power with which to
develop them.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the transatlantic and Arab coalition that once fought
him often seem at odds with each other _ so much so that they have
not yet been able to force him down from his latest efforts to
wriggle out of arms-control inspections. The Security Council,
which enforces economic sanctions against Iraq, has been tied into
knots as a result. And the bureaucrats charged with administering
sanctions have begun to bicker among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But none of this means that Saddam has freed himself either of
the sanctions imposed on him after the war, or of limits on his
ability to produce weapons. However clever he has been in
exploiting divisions among the forces arrayed against him, he still
has not converted his tactical maneuvers into a lasting turnabout
in his fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States, his principal adversary, shows no sign of
relenting in its refusal to re-admit him to the company of
civilized rulers.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, two schools of thought seem to have
emerged from the West's tepid response to Saddam's latest
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   One holds that Saddam stands on the brink of a major breakout
into new power, with the sanctions regime moribund and the
arms-limitation regime collapsing. The other holds that even
without effective arms inspection, Saddam will be little threat
because he is still under the West's stern watch and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the real prospect may be for something quite different:
Continued slow and disconcerting Iraqi gains in the face of Western
disunity, followed by tactical maneuvering by the United States
aimed at frustrating Iraq all the same. And, in the process, a lot
of confusion about who is really winning the game.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the situation now. Since August, Saddam has halted all
new arms inspections by the United Nations Special Commission. U.S.
officials, who have not responded with military threats, fear he
may freeze monitoring, and he has hinted his next step may be to
throw arms inspectors out of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet response this time stands in contrast to what happened
in February, when Saddam suspended inspections of his presidential
palaces and was forced to back down by U.S. military threats. But
that very experience that helps explain why the response is so
muted now. The lesson drawn here seems to have been not so much
what was gained by resisting Saddam so boldly, but what it cost,
both in bargaining power (he got a doubling of the quota of oil he
could export in exchange for food) and in unity.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Saddam extracted the direct involvement of U.N.
Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan as a new layer of officialdom
with whom to deal, between him and the arms-control officials. And
the United States and Britain were deeply impressed by how little
their arguments for using force had moved the other three permanent
members of the Security Council, Russia, France and China, let
alone the Arab countries and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there were divisions within the coalition that
fought Saddam in 1990, and Saddam had only to wait for a new chance
to exploit them.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what he did. His next move was made when Washington
was distracted by a sex scandal, Europeans were up in arms at
American use of sanctions against Cuba and Iran, and Arabs were
seething over the stalled progress toward an Israeli-Palestinian
peace.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, U.S. officials turned out to be more
sensitive to keeping the Russians and French on board than to any
effort to contain Saddam, even if that meant watering down the
effort itself.
</P>
<P>
   So while this allowed Saddam to challenge the arms inspectors,
there is also cause for some frustration among Saddam's
representatives here; the West was not split as it was last time,
and Iraq is no closer to an end of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, new frictions have begun to show.
</P>
<P>
   At the arms-control agency, the forceful Australian diplomat who
has been its leader, Richard Butler, now finds himself not so much
an accuser as the accused. One of the agency's chief inspectors, a
former U.S. marine named Scott Ritter, has quit, saying Butler and
company have gone soft on Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, France and China, on the other hand, continue to say
Butler's agency has been too hard on the Iraqis. In the absence of
an ability to corner the Iraqis with intrusive surprise
inspections, the agency has taken to telegraphing its punches for
publicity effect.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, another U.N. agency charged with distributing food in
Iraq also imploded in controversy. Denis Halliday, who managed the
U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq, resigned in anger, calling the
sanctions regime a cruel farce that was destroying the Iraqi people
while leaving the leadership intact.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, this pitted a U.N. humanitarian-aid official against
the organization's arms-control officials, for whom maintaining
sanctions is the key to keeping pressure on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, some Middle East experts say the initiative
clearly has passed to the Iraqis. ``They are setting the agenda,''
said Judith Kipper of the Center for Strategic and International
Studies in Washington. ``They cause armies to move or withdraw,
they sell oil, they have allies in the Security Council and in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   What comes next? A senior Iraqi official gave this answer: Iraq
will further erode the sanctions and create more confrontations.
``We can choose where,'' the official said. ``We know the United
States wants to keep the sanctions forever, but how much is it
willing to pay for that?''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more than the Iraqis think. ``I would say Iraq has changed
the ground rules of the game,'' said an ambassador from an Arab
country that was in the 1991 coalition. ``But is there light at the
end of the tunnel? Not as long as Saddam is there, because the
United States has built him into public enemy No. 1 and the
Americans too cannot climb down.'' &QL;

Allen Barra is the author of ``Inventing Wyatt Earp,'' Carroll &AMP;
Graf, 1998. 
(bl) 
 By ALLEN BARRA    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One hundred sixteen years ago last Monday, at about 2:47 in the
afternoon, Virgil, Wyatt and Morgan Earp, accompanied by a young,
tubercular dentist-gambler from Georgia named John Henry (Doc)
Holliday, turned left off Fremont Street (now Highway 80) in the
sprawling silver-boom camp of Tombstone, Ariz., and into a vacant
lot in back of the OK Corral. Virgil Earp, the town marshal, said,
``Boys, throw up your hands _ I want your guns,'' after which two
quick shots were heard. Thirty seconds later, every man in the
fight was dead or wounded except Wyatt Earp.
</P>
<P>
   The gunfight in back of the OK Corral has become part of
American mythology _ even an enduring international symbol of
American confrontation. In July, The Toronto Star cautioned General
Motors and the United Auto Workers that ``both could learn a lesson
or two from the gunfight at the OK Corral.'' And in August a
Singapore paper warned that ``a trigger-happy America, blazing away
to glory like Wyatt Earp at the OK Corral, inspires no confidence
in its role as global policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, international symbol may not completely capture the
gunfight's hold on the popular imagination: In an episode of ``Star
Trek,'' Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock were forced to fight the Earps
at the OK Corral. Kirk, it seems, must have landed on Planet
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   All of which belies the gunfight itself, which wasn't that big a
deal, after all.
</P>
<P>
   What happened was, the Earp brothers went down to the lot to
arrest Ike and Billy Clanton and Frank and Tom McLaury, four men
affiliated with a group of cow thieves known as ``the Cowboys.''
(The term was new in the early 1880s and suggested a degree of
rascality.)
</P>
<P>
   Trouble had been brewing between the Earps and Cowboys for two
years _ the rustlers had been stealing cattle in Mexico and
murdering with impunity _ but the immediate cause of the fight was
a deal that Wyatt Earp made with Ike Clanton. Some of Ike's friends
killed a stagecoach driver during an attempted holdup; Wyatt, who
wanted to seek the lucrative office of county sheriff, thought
their capture would win him votes. Ike wanted the reward but
panicked when word got out that he had made a deal with Wyatt Earp.
He probably instigated the fight by goading his younger brother and
the McLaurys into confronting the Earps.
</P>
<P>
   That the fight became legendary astonished Wyatt Earp, a buffalo
hunter, gambler, shotgun guard, saloon keeper, boxing referee, faro
dealer and peace officer, who was born 150 years ago and died in
Los Angeles in 1929. The Tombstone gunfight was his first and only
classic, face-to-face shootout. In cowtowns like Dodge City, he was
renowned for his ability to keep the peace without firing a gun;
the men he killed in the lot in Tombstone may have been the first
he ever shot.
</P>
<P>
   Since his death, Wyatt Earp's image has gone through three
phases.
</P>
<P>
   First, in the 1930s, he was evoked as an antidote to big city
gangsters like Al Capone and Dutch Schultz. In the second, from
about the end of World War II through the Eisenhower era, he stood
for America's Cold War resolve, holding the thin blue line in
defense of democratic ideals. By the late 1960s, his name was
linked with predatory white America. In a 1971 film, ``Doc,'' a
Vietnam War allegory with a script by Pete Hamill, Wyatt was a
sadistic bully who made Lyndon Johnson-type speeches over murdered
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The real Wyatt Earp was an adventurer. He and Josephine Sarah
Marcus, a Jewish actress from New York whom Wyatt met in Tombstone,
roamed boomtowns and mining camps from Arizona to Alaska, making
and losing fortunes, finally settling in Los Angeles into genteel
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   They were together for nearly 47 years. Earp was a minor
celebrity in his later years, lionized by the likes of Jack London,
Charlie Chaplin, John Ford, William S. Hart and Tom Mix, on whose
films he did some advisory work.
</P>
<P>
   But Wyatt couldn't escape the memory of the gunfight in
Tombstone. He still hasn't.
</P>
<P>
   Why did history and Hollywood choose to make the gunfight at the
OK Corral immortal? A partial answer is that Americans have always
looked to the West _ to the Alamo, to Custer's Last Stand, to the
OK Corral _ for defining moments in the national character.
</P>
<P>
   Another is that, in time, post-Marx historians saw the Earps and
the Cowboys as representatives of opposing cultural and political
forces. The Earps were Republicans who worked for Eastern
capitalists like Wells Fargo _ in the words of one sociologist,
``incorporation gunfighters'' _ while the Cowboys were ``resistance
gunfighters'' of ``Southern Democratic values,'' if values can be
stretched to include cattle and stagecoach theft.
</P>
<P>
   There were also issues of jurisdiction that echo to this day.
Who had the authority _ Town Marshal Virgil Earp (also a deputy
U.S. marshal) or County Sheriff John Behan, a political rival to
the Earps and an ally of the Cowboys? (To add spice to the debate,
Josephine Marcus had left Behan for Wyatt before the gunfight.) The
Earps, as the only federal law in their part of the Arizona
Territory, were regarded by many locals with the same contempt that
right-wing Westerners still hold for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Why Wyatt Earp has been singled out is a more complex question.
The answer may have less to do with the gunfight than with what
followed it. In retaliation for the Tombstone fight, Virgil and
Morgan were ambushed, and Morgan was killed. Wyatt then formed a
posse and hunted down the assassins, bringing back no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   He never apologized for his actions and died without finishing
his autobiography. Ever since, people have been trying to claim him
for their own and put words in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In 1931, a former press secretary to Teddy Roosevelt named
Stuart Lake published the hugely successful ``Wyatt Earp: Frontier
Marshal.'' About half of it was fiction and the other half
exaggerated truth, which would prove to be more truth than most
subsequent books on Earp. And the best-selling Earp book of recent
years, ``I Married Wyatt Earp,'' supposedly the memoirs of
Josephine Marcus and currently in print from the University of
Arizona Press, is now recognized by Earp researchers as a hoax.
(Her real unfinished memoirs remain unpublished.)
</P>
<P>
   But nothing would have struck Wyatt Earp as odder than the way
people have used his name to push an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Pat Buchanan kicked off his 1996 presidential campaign
by posing with guns and gun belt in front of the OK Corral. It's a
good thing for Buchanan that Earp wasn't at his media bash. He
might have hauled him off to court for violating local gun control
laws.

   English Court Blocks Pinochet Extradition
</P>
<P>
   An international effort to hold Gen. Augusto Pinochet
accountable for the more than 3,000 people who died during his
17-year rule in Chile was blocked in London. England's High Court
ruled that he could not be extradited to Spain to face charges of
genocide and torture because he is immune from prosecution as a
former head of state.
</P>
<P>
   The court granted bail to the 82-year-old general, but ordered
him to remain in a London hospital pending an appeal by prosecutors
next week. He had been arrested Oct. 16 after a Spanish judge
investigating human rights abuses in Chile in the 1970s and 1980s
sought his extradition to Madrid.

   Piazza Sets the Bar At $91 Million  &QL;

<P>
   Is Mike Piazza worth $91 million? The New York Mets fervently
hope so. They signed the catcher to a seven-year contract that made
him the highest-paid baseball player ever _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not successful here, it's tough,'' the former
Dodger said. ``But when you win here, it's twice as good as
anyplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets then committed $32 million more to sign Al Leiter,
their lefthanded pitching ace, for four years. Leiter grew up in
New Jersey rooting for the Mets, but he began his career as a New
York Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Yankees centerfielder Bernie Williams wants a bigger
deal than Piazza's and has entered the free agent market to get it.

   AIDS Virus Resurges When Drugs Are Cut Back
</P>
<P>
   Scientists announced bad news for people infected with the AIDS
virus who had hoped to escape the drug ``cocktail,'' a prescription
of 20 to 30 pills a day that can cost $15,000 a year and that is
causing unusual and dangerous side effects in more and more
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Two new studies, published in The New England Journal of
Medicine, showed that efforts to help patients by reducing the
number of medications in the cocktail backfired, allowing
resurgence of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers said that efforts to simplify the treatment must
continue, because the strict schedule of doses is hard to follow,
and in some people, the drugs cause dangerously high cholesterol
and terribly disfiguring fat deposits in the neck and abdomen.

   Modern No Longer, Four Drawings Are Evicted
</P>
<P>
   When she died in 1948, Abby Aldrich Rockefeller left four
important drawings _ two by van Gogh and two by Seurat _ to the
Museum of Modern Art in New York but with an unusual stipulation.
As one of the founders of the Modern, she believed passionately
that the museum should be devoted exclusively to art of the new. So
after 50 years the drawings were to go to rival institutions with
collections from many eras.
</P>
<P>
   Time was up this month, and two drawings by van Gogh, ``Hospital
Corridor at St.-Remy'' and ``Street at Stes.-Maries'' went to the
Metropolitan Museum. The two Seurats, ``Lady With a Parasol'' and
``Young Girl,'' were delivered to the Art Institute of Chicago.
Both Seurats are studies for the artist's masterpiece ``Sunday
Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte,'' which hangs in the
Art Institute.

   Apparent Starr Leaks Cited  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Newly released documents showed that a federal judge has ruled
that prosecutors in the office of Kenneth Starr, the independent
counsel investigating President Clinton, apparently leaked grand
jury testimony or other secret information. The ruling by U.S.
District Court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson was based on a review
of 24 news accounts about the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Johnson authorized an investigator, who is looking into
the matter to seize and examine the prosecutors' telephone records
and logs along with their appointment calendars, memos and other
documents to determine if they leaked information to the press.

   U.S. Ex-Sergeant Charged In Bin Laden Conspiracy

   Law enforcement officials said secret charges have been filed
against a former sergeant in the United States Special Forces who
is suspected of joining a global campaign to attack Americans
mounted by Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile.
</P>
<P>
   The former sergeant, Ali A. Mohamed, was charged in September at
a closed court hearing in Manhattan, according to the officials,
who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The charges are part of an
effort by federal authorities to prove that bin Laden was behind
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa in August. Mohamed, 46,
served at the Army's Special Forces base in Fort Bragg, N.C., and
was honorably discharged in 1989.

Russia got bronchitis in Uzbekistan. He rushed home to rest up for
a summit in Vienna with the head of the European Union.

   But on the eve of his departure, scheduled for last Wednesday,
Yeltsin called in sick again, now with ``asthenia'' _ Russian for

   In the Land of the Cracked Head
</P>
<P>
   Italian mothers, who run screaming into the ocean to pluck out
children who dare to swim less than an hour after lunch, seem to
lose all their caution once they hit the road.
</P>
<P>
   It is far from uncommon in Rome to see a mother speeding her
child to school on a moped, neither of them wearing helmets.
</P>
<P>
   The logic is impeccable. It is illegal to carry children on
mopeds, so manufacturers do not make child-sized helmets. Ergo,
parents drive their children bareheaded. ``In this city,'' Federica
Frontani, 31, explained, ``what else can you do?''
</P>
<P>
   Mopeds are a national addiction, a way of beating the snarled
traffic that clogs Rome and most other major cities. Businessmen,
teen-agers and mothers all drive them, and precious few wear
helmets, which seem to clash with the country's highly tuned sense
of style.
</P>
<P>
   The government is hoping to pass a new law soon that would
require all moped drivers _ not just minors under the age of 18 _
to wear helmets. But law-enforcement experts are pessimistic that
Italians will obey it. Other safety rules in Italy are routinely
flouted: Only 10 percent of Italians obey the law and buckle their
seat belts, whereas 92 percent of Germans do.

   Not Happy? Just Wait.
</P>
<P>
   Ha! Those twentysomethings thought the world was their own
private banana split, didn't they _ with their perfect skin,
functioning knees and forests of silky hair. They thought the
over-50 set was just drooling with envy.
</P>
<P>
   Well, guess what: Youth just might not buy you happiness after
all.
</P>
<P>
   A new study by two Fordham University scientists, Dr. Daniel
Mroczek and Christian Kolarz, suggests that as people age, they get
steadily more cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which looked at people aged 25 to 74 and appears in
the November issue of the Journal of Personality and Social
Psychology, found that the rise in good spirits was especially
strong in men.
</P>
<P>
   So is it simply that older people who lived through World War
II, and perhaps the Depression, might trasure peace and
prosperity? That might be part of it. Or maybe the older
generation, resisting the current mania to tell all, keeps some
sadness private.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Laura Carstensen, a Stanford University psychologist,
says it could well be that older people have become good at
regulating their emotions. ``There is an appreciation of life,''
she said, ``that is associated with a sense of well-being and
satisfaction.''
</P>
<P>
   So the youngsters, as they dance the gloomy night away, will
just have to wait patiently for that glorious day when their hair
falls out too.

   Millions of sports addicts tune into ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' for
their daily fix of highlights, but it's a good bet not all of them
fully understand everything the anchors say.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on popular culture, inside jokes and hip-hop lingo,
``SportsCenter,'' which airs live three times nightly on the
24-hour sports cable network, has helped create a rich, arcane new
sports vernacular _ from Dan Patrick's ``He's en fuego'' to Rich
Eisen's ``He busts out the whuppin' stick!'' to Rece Davis' ``No
soup for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone, Mel Allen's ``How about that?''
</P>
<P>
   The explosion of catch phrases has helped make ESPN anchors
stars in their own right. There is even a fan-generated web site,
``The SportsCenter Altar'' (address at the end of this article),
which lists each anchor's trademark lines, with a link to another
site that allows fellow worshippers to download the actual audio.
</P>
<P>
   What do the catch phrases mean? Where did they come from? Here
is a sampling from what could be a modern sports lexicon.

   ``Release, rotation, splash.''

``SportsCenter'' attract a more diverse audience by peppering his
calls with rap lyrics and playground idioms. ``When I say someone

same as when Dan Patrick says a guy is `en fuego,''' says Scott.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Nov. 1, moved Saturday in the `a' category. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This final budget adds: TV-SPORTS-LINGO-REVIEW and
GLENN-DOLLS-REVIEW.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTIONS-REVIEW _ Rep. John Linder of Georgia, chairman of the
National Republican Congressional Committee, perhaps said it best,
and certainly most succinctly, when he was asked last week which
issue was dominating the elections on Tuesday. ``Nothing,'' he
said. Yet the prevailing sense of a fat and happy _ and
uninterested _ electorate clashes weirdly with the dire, often
despairing, warnings from candidates that have marked this campaign
season. With undiminished fervor, politicians have been loudly
proclaiming one calamity after another, offering themselves as
salvation from, take your pick: the health care crisis; the
education crisis; the Social Security crisis; the moral crisis; the
crisis in the environment; the crisis in international markets. By
Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   NASA-REVIEW _ Last week National Aeronautics and Space
Administration officials turned out in force at Cape Canaveral,
Fla., for another lesson in space-agency showmanship as NASA
skillfully orchestrated both a high-stakes drama and a world-class
nostalgia trip by sending 77-year-old John Glenn back into orbit.
For Glenn's flight aboard the space shuttle Discovery, NASA
succeeded in drawing to Florida an estimated 250,000 people and the
largest contingent of journalists ever to cover a space launching.
By William J. Broad. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-REVIEW _ Since Benjamin Netanyahu has returned from
Washington with a signed peace agreement, he has been the subject
of rabid protest and threats from the far right, particularly the
radicals of the Jewish settler movement. In demonstrations, on the
radio and at a funeral for a terrorism victim, the language used to
attack the prime minister has had a creepy echo for most Israelis.
The words are the same that were used against Yitzhak Rabin after
he brought home the Oslo interim peace accord in 1993. By Deborah
Sontag. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IRAQ-REVIEW _ ``Divide and conquer'' is an ancient tactic that
Saddam Hussein refined into an art form as a dictator in Iraq. Now,
it seems, it has done him good service in aggravating the United
States and its one-time allies as they struggle to keep him in the
corner where they put him after the Persian Gulf war. These days,
it seems, there are only divisions in the complicated apparatus
designed to prevent him from acquiring new weapons of mass
destruction or the economic power with which to develop them.
Members of the transatlantic and Arab coalition that once fought
him often seem at odds with each other _ so much so that they have
failed to come up with a successful response to his latest efforts
to wriggle out of arms-control inspections. By Youssef M. Ibrahim. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA-ENERGY-REVIEW _ Americans are consuming about as much
energy as they did 25 years ago. They are living in bigger homes
crammed with more appliances and driving larger, more powerful cars
and more light trucks. They using energy as if it were limitless _
consuming far more per person than Asians or Europeans. Only
Canadians, with more heavy industry and more chilblains, consume
more. By Allen R. Myerson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK-GUNFIGHT-REVIEW _ Why did history and Hollywood choose to
make the gunfight at the O.K. Corral immortal? A partial answer is
that Americans have always looked to the West _ to the Alamo, to
Custer's Last Stand, to the O.K. Corral _ for defining moments in
the national character. Another is that, in time, post-Marx
historians saw the Earps and the Cowboys as representatives of
opposing cultural and political forces. By Allen Barra. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD-AGE-REVIEW _ There's no place quite like Hollywood for
its obsession with youth _ but anguish about getting older is
hardly limited to well-known actors and actresses surgically
carving up their faces to look younger. Writers over 50, especially
on television, are virtually shut out of many top shows because
they are considered too old and too out of touch by network
executives and producers who are in their 20s and 30s. By Bernard
Weinraub. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MARATHONS-REVIEW _ The 32,000 runners in Sunday's New York City
Marathon will be cheered by 2 million spectators, serenaded by 40
bands, hydrated at 24 water stations and tinctured at two dozen
medical stations. But, alas, there will be no oyster tent at Mile
25. While New York's is one of the world's great marathons, it is
not one of the most exotic. For those who crave the slithery slide
of mollusks instead of the chewy energy of Power Bars for that
final surge across the finish, the Marathon des Chateaux du Medoc
in France's Bordeaux wine country is the place to go. By Jere
Longman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-WOMEN-REVIEW _ Women often complain that working women
have a tougher time in Japan than in any other industrialized
country. While there has been some improvement in recent years, the
Japanese government is now trying to confront the issue by
releasing new guidelines in an effort to bar sexual harassment. By
Sheryl Wudunn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GRAMMAR-REVIEW _ For grammarians, lexicographers and linguists,
it's the Thing That Will Not Die. Just when they think it's buried
once and for all, the corpse rises again to haunt a new generation.
The creature walking among us, if you haven't already guessed, is
the old ``rule'' of grammar that says we shouldn't split an
infinitive. It's been pronounced dead every few years for more than
a century, but it just won't be laid to rest. In the hearts of true
believers, it's still a sin to ever put an adverb (like ``ever'')
between the word ``to'' and the infinitive form of a verb. The
latest post-mortem comes from Oxford University Press, which
publishes the granddaddy of dictionaries, the Oxford English
Dictionary, as well as baby dictionaries of every size and
description. By Patricia T. O'connor.
</P>
<P>
   TV-SPORTS-LINGO-REVIEW _ Drawing on popular culture, inside
jokes and hip-hop lingo, ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' has helped create
a rich, arcane new sports vernacular _ from Dan Patrick's ``He's en
fuego'' to Rich Eisen's ``He busts out the whuppin' stick!'' to
Rece Davis' ``No soup for you!'' What do the catch phrases mean?
Where did they come from? Here is a sampling from what could be a
modern sports lexicon.
</P>
<P>
   GLENN-DOLLS-REVIEW-NYT _ They may be the first septuagenarian
action figures ever. As John Glenn prepared to be catapulted into
space aboard the Discovery shuttle last week, miniature John Glenns
began landing on toy-store shelves. By Pam Belluck.

<P>
   BEIJING _ China's family planning system, notorious for the
harsh rules and punishments it deploys in its quest to limit
births, has quietly started urging its workers to soften their
approach, hoping to improve its often tense relationship with
Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
   In a small but rapidly increasing number of counties, officials
say they have eliminated the onerous system of permits for
pregnancy and quotas stipulating how many children can be born in a
year, giving women far greater choice in deciding when to have a
child and somewhat more leeway in deciding how many children to
have.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate aim is still to control this vast country's
population growth, yielding families with one child in the cities
and generally two in rural areas. But officials say they now hope
to achieve that end not by fiat and coerced abortions, but through
a broader women's-health system that discourages large families
through patient education, contraceptive choice and heavy taxes for
couples who choose to have an additional child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expanding our programs and changing our attitudes,''
said Cong Jun, a director general at the State Family Planning
Commission. ``We want to change from an administrative program
focusing on numbers to more of a service-oriented approach.'' Just
this week, the commission issued regulations prohibiting
grass-roots family planning workers from forcing women to undergo
abortions or sterilization, although officials contend such
coercion is rare.
</P>
<P>
   The new-style approach, which was officially first tried as a
furtive experiment in six counties several years ago, has not
affected the vast majority of Chinese women _ most do not know it
exists. But dozens of similar programs have taken root across the
country in the last 18 months, with at least the tacit support of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a big change in approach and these kinds of
changes have been expanding rapidly,'' said Tu Ping, a professor at
Beijing University, who has urged change. This is the first time
this system's leaders have sanctioned relaxing the core controls,
although some women have long skirted regulations by having
unapproved children and some local officials have tolerated it.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a relatively small experiment in a variegated country
of 1.26 billion, and many obstacles remain, from dissent among high
officials to the ingrained habits of local family planning
officials accustomed to strong-arm techniques, to the deep
suspicion of women toward a system whose methods they have long
regarded as brutish and capricious _ even as they have supported
population control, its ultimate aim.
</P>
<P>
   A 29-year-old Communist Party member and hospital administrator
from southern China, who spoke on condition that she be identified
only by her surname, Zhang, said that less than two years ago
family planning officials at her work site stripped her of her job,
stopped her paychecks and held her down for a pelvic exam to check
her fetus' age when they asserted that she had become pregnant
before obtaining her permit to have her one and only child. She
said a shift in approach would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if these policies can be implemented it would be
better for all of us,'' she said. ``It would be a big improvement
for Chinese women.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Family Planning Program has increasingly
seemed to be an anachronism. High-powered couples who choose jobs
and buy homes and travel the world are thrown back into a Mao-era
time warp when they want to have a child, which in most places
still requires gaining permits from the local government and a
woman's employer before pregnancy occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Women can be turned down if their company or neighborhood has
exceeded its quota of births for the year. And couples who dare to
have a child without permits, or _ worse _ an illegal second child,
can face heavy financial penalties, job loss or, in some cases,
police detention.
</P>
<P>
   In areas with the new family planning programs, there has been
change. In Shanghai and the wealthy seaboard region of northern
Zhejiang Province, women no longer need approval to have their
first child. Some districts in Beijing are experimenting with this
system and Ms. Cong said the whole city would probably adopt the
change.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a number of family-planning clinics are
undergoing makeovers so that dreary offices whose primary function
used to be inserting IUD's and performing tubal ligations or
abortions now are offering an expanded range of services from
wide-ranging contraceptive counseling to support for breast-feeding
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Also in these zones, officials emphasize that people who are
technically allowed only one child (generally city dwellers and
rural residents with a son) may have a second without fear of
punishment. They simply pay a ``family planning fee'' to cover the
cost of an additional citizen.

   Officials here assert that having an extra child has never
really been regarded as a crime and that the payments are not
``fines,'' as they were commonly called in the past. That may be
news to people like Qu, a farmer in rural Hebei Province who spoke
on condition he be identified only by his surname. He said he was
detained for a week by the public-security bureau two years ago
after his son had an unapproved second child. But where the new
system has taken hold, the tenor of family planning has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Lingjun, a well-dressed 29-year-old who had brought her
5-month-old son into the Tianlin subdistrict family planning center
in Shanghai to have a small scrape on his head checked, said: ``I
think I'd really like to have a second, a girl. When the time
comes, if we really want another and we can afford it, we will
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shanghai is the most cosmopolitan city in China, and its
population is shrinking anyway. It is less clear how this policy
will be received in more conservative cities, like Beijing, or in
China's vast rural areas, where larger families are considered
desirable and sons essential, where health workers are not
accustomed to giving women choices and women are not accustomed to
having them.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Heshan village in the midst of Zhejiang's fertile
plains, Yang Lizhen, 35, sat in a whitewashed sitting room adorned
with posters of Hong Kong pop stars and explained how she had an
IUD put in nine years ago after the birth of her daughter. A
factory worker with cropped hair and a broad smile who speaks only
her provincial dialect, she looked puzzled when asked if she had
considered other contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about other methods,'' she said. ``I go to the
family planning center three or four times a year where she checks
my IUD. I have not been informed about other choices.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, only 39 percent of women who underwent tubal ligation
had counseling before surgery, according to the Family Planning
Commission. The vast majority of Chinese women still have an IUD
inserted after the birth of a first child and are sterilized after
the second, although in the cities that is changing.
</P>
<P>
   The modern family-planning clinic in Yuyao City in Zhejiang,
where counselors provide up-to-date advice on sex and
contraceptives, also dispenses a jarring reminder of the system's
authoritarian policies: an advisory to newlyweds that if they have
certain medical conditions _ from schizophrenia to colon polyps to
congenital hearing loss _ they are forbidden to have children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cong of the State Family Planning Commission said that
family-planning workers would have to change their attitude and, to
that end, the commission has been sending officials to courses in
the United States and to Thailand's voluntary family-planning
clinics to ``show them that there are other options for
accomplishing our goals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China has made a great effort to change to a client centered
program _ and that is a very welcome thing,'' said Dr. Ardash
Misra, an official of Partners in Population and Development, an
organization devoted to promoting voluntary population control in
third-world nations, which accepted China as a member late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign experts say that China will also have to reshape the
family-planning hierarchy, in which promotion has depended on
enforcing a low birth rate. ``They'll really have to redefine what
is a good family planning cadre,'' said a Western health expert
based in Beijing. ``Otherwise there will be no chance for change.''
</P>
<P>
   The new programs have taken root in various ways. The State
Family Planning Commission is financing official experiments in
more than a dozen locations. Private foundations, like Ford and
Rockefeller, have added money and expertise to the mix. The United
Nations Population Fund has helped the commission put together
similar programs in 32 counties _ an act that has prompted Congress
to withhold financing for the agency, saying it did not want
American money spent in a country that performs so many abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been bottom-up support as well. When a private
group organized a training seminar for workers from official test
counties, officials from dozens of other cities turned up as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reproductive choice'' retains a carefully circumscribed
meaning in China. The general policy is that only certain families
may have more than one child: those who belong to ethnic
minorities, rural families whose first child is a daughter,
families where both parents are themselves only children, and
families in which the first child is handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Others who want an additional child pay stiff fees. In Shanghai,
the fee is three times the combined annual salary of the parents.
In Zhejiang, it is 20 percent of the parents' combined salaries for
five years. In Qinghai Province, the government has added a carrot
to the stick, offering smaller families special low-interest
business loans.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood this is not, but Chinese seem alternately
dubious and hopeful about the promise of change, particularly if
the program better monitors its workers. Although officials insist
that abuse is rare, it seems that almost everyone in China knows
someone whose life has been turned into a hellish nightmare by
zealous family planning officials, who sometimes mete out
punishments that far exceed those stipulated in government
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize there existed problems and we have started to
manage them,'' said Li Honggui, commission vice minister.
</P>
<P>
   A move away from a rigid family-planning system based on IUD's
and sterilization was perhaps inevitable in a country where women
now have many choices in their personal lives and can read about
sex, condoms and birth control pills in magazines like Elle.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a change in the government, where a new
generation of officials, like Ms. Cong, has studied overseas and is
attuned to issues of patient choice.
</P>
<P>
   But China can now afford to give women more freedom than when
the One Child Policy was adopted in 1980, in the midst of a
population explosion. After two decades of iron-fisted family
planning, the average number of children has dropped, from almost
six to about two per woman of child-bearing age, since 1970. And,
in the new market economy _ where parents must pay rent, child care
and school fees _ it is unlikely that a population explosion will
resume.
</P>
<P>
   Many urban Chinese today only want one child. ``I never thought
for a moment about having a second,'' said Wu Aiqing, 40, on her
lunch break from her factory job, fashionably dressed in a yellow
blouse and long black skirt. ``The state encourages us to have just
one child. But anyway it's too expensive and I want to focus on my
work.''

IN NEW CHALLENGE TO U.N., IRAQ HALTS ARMS MONITORING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its most serious challenge to the United Nations in more than
a year of intermittent crises, Iraq said Saturday that it was
suspending all cooperation with international arms inspectors and
would close down their long-term monitoring operations immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The action, announced in Baghdad after a meeting of President
Saddam Hussein and his top advisers, goes beyond even the Iraqi ban
on spot inspections imposed since August and effectively ends
almost all surveillance of Iraq's weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq said it had taken the step in response to a Security
Council decision Friday to reject its demands that a proposed
``comprehensive review'' of its relations with the United Nations
should automatically lead to a lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi action left uncertain what would happen to more than
100 international inspectors and support staff in the country.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials were meeting with Iraqi officials Saturday
evening in Baghdad to discuss the details of the order.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton quickly summoned his national
security advisers for a meeting at the White House in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this as a very serious matter,'' said the National
Security Council spokesman, David Leavy.
</P>
<P>
   The administration officials also planned to discuss Iraq's
intransigence with officials at the United Nations and with Western
allies.
</P>
<P>
   The headquarters of the U.N. operations in Iraq is a monitoring
center at the edge of Baghdad, where experts view film from remote
video cameras trained on Iraqi factories and other production and
storage sites, and scientists analyze a battery of air, water and
soil samplers.
</P>
<P>
   All of these surveillance tools, which were set up in Iraq in
the years immediately after the end of the Persian Gulf War in 1991
and which were intended to remain in operation even after an
eventual lifting of sanctions, are now apparently being closed down
by Iraq for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Only the International Atomic Energy Agency will be allowed to
operate in Iraq, and only in nonintrusive monitoring without spot
inspections, the Iraqi announcement said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, a U.N. group that monitors nuclear programs around
the world, has come closest to declaring that spot inspections in
Iraq could be wound down and supplanted by long-term monitoring,
after it found no evidence of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Western experts have questioned that assumption, however, saying
Iraq has preserved the ability to assemble weapons. The United
States has so far been successful in blocking efforts to ``close
the file'' on nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   In their announcement, the Iraqis renewed their demand for the
dismissal of Richard Butler, the Australian arms-control expert who
is executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission. The
commission has been responsible since 1991 for disarming Iraq and
ensuring that it does not have the ability to make prohibited
biological and chemical weapons as well as missiles with a range of
more than 90 miles.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis also demanded that the Special Commission, known as
UNSCOM, should not have access to information collected by the
International Atomic Energy Agency. UNSCOM had routinely combined
the agency's data with its own in reports to the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint meeting decided to halt all kinds of dealing with
the Special Commission and its chief, and stop all their activities
in Iraq, including the monitoring, starting from today,'' the Iraqi
statement broadcast in Baghdad said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials have been threatening a boycott of UNSCOM since
repeated crises over access for arms inspectors began in the fall
of 1997, when the expulsion of U.S. inspectors led to a withdrawal
of all monitors for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   They have also said in interviews that it takes a crisis to
attract the attention of Washington and the United Nations to
Baghdad's complaints that eight years of sanctions have destroyed
the Iraqi economy, caused innocent civilians to suffer and produced
no new proof of prohibited arms.
</P>
<P>
   UNSCOM officials counter that while the phase of destruction of
arms stockpiles may be over, inspectors still have a lot of
documentation to complete on the scale of past Iraqi programs, so
that they can be certain that everything _ ammunition, fuel and
components as well as weapons _ has been accounted for. Iraq's
refusal this year to hand over documents has complicated their
task, to Baghdad's disadvantage, Butler says.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About a year ago, Iraq apparently decided that it would end the
inspection program this year one way or another. Saddam was
evidently emboldened by two subsequent developments: the failure of
the United States to gain much support for a military confrontation
with Iraq at the beginning of this year and the visit of
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to Baghdad in February.
</P>
<P>
   The visit of Annan was followed by the forging of new diplomatic
links between his office and the Iraqi government that bypassed the
Security Council and reduced UNSCOM's influence while making its
job harder.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky scandal that has weakened President Clinton
politically has also been a factor, some diplomats say.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by Russia, France and to some degree China, as well as
some rotating Security Council members disturbed at conditions in
Iraq, Saddam has pushed hard for a lifting of sanctions, in
particular the oil embargo, which has cost Iraq billions of dollars
in lost income.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States, backed by Britain, Japan and others,
proved capable of blocking these moves, Iraq reacted in August by
stopping on-site inspections by UNSCOM and the International Atomic
Energy Agency, and soon began interfering with some monitoring
activities.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a unified Security Council decided, to Baghdad's
dismay, to end regular sanctions reviews, in effect keeping Iraq
under an embargo indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq then shifted to demands for a wide-ranging review of all
its relations with the United Nations, conducted by the
secretary-general, not the Security Council, as another way of
getting sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday that move also failed when the Security Council, again
unanimously, said it would supervise the review, but first
inspections had to be operating normally. And there were no
promises about lifting sanctions, though Iraq appears to have
thought it could extract some.

NYC POLICE LAG IN FIGHTING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BY OFFICERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI and KEVIN FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the fall of 1995, Officer Anthony Nieves was
accused of two offenses that could hardly have been more different.
</P>
<P>
   Already a suspect in the murder of one girlfriend, he was
arrested for harassing another. Then he was caught, while off duty,
sprinting onto the field at Yankee Stadium to high-five a player.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when police officials considered the incidents, they imposed
punishments that could hardly have been more similar.
</P>
<P>
   His antics at the stadium earned him a 30-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Harassing his girlfriend earned him a 29-day suspension.
</P>
<P>
   The way the Nieves case was handled is not unusual for the New
York City Police Department, which critics say has long been
complacent in its approach to domestic abuse complaints against its
officers _ complaints that are rising sharply.
</P>
<P>
   A review of department records shows that officers found guilty
of domestic abuse in administrative proceedings are rarely fired,
and that some are punished with suspensions of just 15 days _ the
same penalty given to officers caught sleeping on the job or taking
an unjustified sick day.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement and domestic violence experts say the
department, despite its size and a climbing number of abuse
complaints, is far less aggressive in detecting and punishing
domestic abusers on the force than are departments in other large
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year, the Police Department has received 821
complaints of domestic abuse by officers, from threats to actual
assaults, a 40 percent increase over the total for last year. In
the last three years, more than 120 officers have been arrested on
charges relating to domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   In one high-profile case, Officer Patrick Fitzgerald, a
patrolman in the 34th Precinct, shot and killed himself, his wife
and their two children in September at the family's home in Orange
County. Relatives of Fitzgerald's wife, Leeanne, said afterward
that she had called the 34th Precinct station house several times
to complain that he was abusing her, but that the calls were not
taken seriously. Police officials have said they cannot find any
record of such calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a culture in the Police Department that just doesn't
want to admit how serious this problem is,'' said Dr. Eleanor Pamm,
a domestic violence expert at John Jay College of Criminal Justice
and a member of the Mayor's Task Force on Domestic Violence. ``And
until they get serious about it, the situation isn't going to get
any better. People are going to continue to suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Domestic violence experts say that when police officers, with
their ready access to guns, are involved in household disputes,
arguments that would otherwise end in bruises or wounded feelings
can quickly escalate into bloodshed. Over the last three years in
New York, domestic incidents involving officers have claimed 10
lives by murder or suicide. Three more spouses died under
suspicious circumstances, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   New York police officials say they are vigilant in rooting out
abusive officers and punishing colleagues who try to protect them.
But abuse by officers, both on and off duty, is difficult to
combat, experts said. A feeling of futility often prevents victims
from reporting abuse, and a code of silence among officers
frequently makes them reluctant to turn in their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Except in the most serious crimes, prosecutors generally leave
the punishment of officers up to the department's internal
disciplinary system. But records show that the department rarely
punishes officers severely, even when the accusations involve
domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments in other large cities have made greater
strides in addressing domestic abuse among officers, according to
domestic violence experts.
</P>
<P>
   In Baltimore, officials set up an elaborate network in 1997 to
monitor complaints against officers who lived in outlying suburbs.
In Los Angeles, officials created a five-member investigative team
last year devoted solely to accusations of battering by officers.
In Chicago, the department hired full-time counselors in 1994 to
help victims of police domestic abuse follow through on their
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   New York City has adopted none of these strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kelleher, the first deputy police commissioner in New
York, said that, given the size of the 40,000-member force, he
would describe the abuse problem as ``relatively small, but very
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last three years, according to police statistics, the
department has suspended 162 officers without pay for domestic
violence, and fired 13. Since a 1995 domestic dispute in which a
police officer was killed, the department has required that a
captain respond at the scene to every abuse complaint against an
officer. Kelleher said the department is installing new policies,
including a pilot program, tried once earlier this year, in which
officers with a history of domestic violence attend an eight-week
course in stress reduction and conflict resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really not familiar with what's happening in other cities,
like Chicago,'' Kelleher said, ``But I do know we are light-years
ahead of where we were a few years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donald Sheehan of the FBI, a special agent coordinating the
bureau's effort to reduce family violence by officers, said: ``New
York hasn't been able to get a grip on the problem. What it takes
is a commitment from the highest level of the department, and we
just haven't seen that yet.''

<P>
   THE POLICE RESPONSE: A Plea for Help Is Heeded Too Late
</P>
<P>
   Bliss Verdon thought the Police Department could help her when
her former boyfriend, a transit police officer, began harassing her
in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Verdon, a 25-year-old social worker, reported that
Officer Rodney Dilbert had left an angry and abusive diatribe on
her answering machine, a sergeant went to her home in Queens to
investigate. While he was there, Dilbert called and the sergeant
took the telephone, saying he would handle the matter ``cop to
cop,'' according to a police report. He scolded Dilbert, but filed
no official report with the Internal Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later Dilbert was back. He trailed Ms. Verdon on the
subway, shoved her into a parked car and tried to force his way
into the office building where she worked, according to police
records. Frightened, she went to the 115th Precinct station house
near her home to file a complaint. But police commanders who would
speak only on the condition of anonymity said precinct supervisors
were delayed in investigating the complaint because they were busy
handling another matter _ the political fallout from having given a
state senator a traffic summons.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, officials decided Dilbert was not an imminent
threat and took no action.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Verdon called the station again, it was not until
June 10 that her complaint was assigned to transit investigators.
By then it was too late. That evening, Dilbert killed Ms. Verdon,
shooting her eight times with his service pistol while she used a
phone booth near her home, then killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir fired one of the six
supervisors involved in the Verdon case and forced another to
retire, but he said the tragedy was caused by a failure of
``individuals, not the system.'' Ms. Verdon's mother, Jo-Ann Cote,
still blames the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter didn't have to die,'' Ms. Cote said. ``She did
everything she could do to make them aware of this man threatening
her, this man who had their gun. The Police Department just didn't
want to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Verdon's case is an example of why domestic violence experts
say the spouses of abusive police officers are especially
vulnerable. Officers are often reluctant to turn in their
colleagues. And some abusive officers use their connections inside
the criminal justice system to block their victims' appeals for
help. Some women are so sure the law enforcement system is stacked
against them that they will not report the crime, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These women are really all alone out there,'' said Maria
Guarracino, of the Archdiocese of New York, who counsels victims of
police spousal abuse. ``There are just so few places for them to
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   It took two complaints of domestic abuse against Michael
Ferrante, a Bronx narcotics detective, to get the department to
take serious action.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrante was accused of hitting his estranged wife, Lisa, during
an encounter in Yonkers in 1994, according to the police. But his
wife declined to press charges, and he was not arrested. The Police
Department did open an administrative case against him, but found
the allegations of abuse ``unsubstantiated,'' even though Mrs.
Ferrante had been treated at a hospital for facial injuries. Within
three months, Ferrante was back on full duty.
</P>
<P>
   After that incident, the detective began threatening his
girlfriend, Carol Nanna, 30, according to her family. But Ms. Nanna
said she never called the police to report the threats. ``I was
always afraid to because he was a cop, and I always felt they stuck
together,'' she said.

<P>
   In May of this year, Ms. Nanna finally moved out of their home
in Yonkers after Ferrante threatened her with his gun, she said.
She reported the threat to the police, and Ferrante was stripped of
his gun the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, as Ms. Nanna sat in her car at an intersection,
Ferrante attacked her with a knife, according to police, slashing
her face, puncturing her lung and nearly severing her left arm,
injuries from which she has yet to fully recover.
</P>
<P>
   Ferrante is awaiting trial on a charge of attempted murder. His
lawyer, Paul Goldberger, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nanna's family said the Police Department had taken too long
to act against Ferrante.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you threaten anybody, you should not be a police officer,''
said Susan Milo, Ms. Nanna's mother. ``As far as I am concerned,
they are not doing enough, because they are not monitoring these
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   A COMPARISON: Other Cities Use Stiffer Penalties &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some experts contend that police work, with its emphasis on
giving orders and establishing control, attracts many men with a
propensity for domestic violence. Although police officials
generally reject that view, almost all large police departments
have taken steps to address the problem _ some more aggressively
than others.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a new federal law required police departments to take
guns away from officers who had been convicted of domestic abuse.
When New York reviewed the personnel history of its police force
that year, it found that 88 officers had criminal records for
domestic abuse. But the department could not move against them
because their cases had been dismissed under probation programs and
erased from the court records.
</P>
<P>
   Some police departments decided to place officers with histories
of abuse in special monitoring programs. Others studied psychiatric
tests the officers took as candidates to devise new screening
questions to weed out other abusive candidates. New York did not
follow up on the 88 officers with a history of family violence,
said Kelleher, the first deputy commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   In several cities, officials said they viewed abusive officers
as threats to more than just their spouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``This officer is carrying our weapon and he is supposed to be
serving the citizens,'' said Col. Margaret Patten of the Baltimore
police. ``That may sound lofty, but do we want a criminal being
responsible for upholding the law?''
</P>
<P>
   Under Baltimore's ``zero tolerance'' policy, the department
fires any officer found to have been involved in domestic abuse.
``We don't care if the victim doesn't want to prosecute,'' Col.
Patten said. ``We have a responsibility to go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Baltimore has received 49 complaints of domestic
abuse by its officers, and has fired nine. Meanwhile in New York,
where the force and the number of complaints are more than 10 times
larger, officials have fired two.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, the focus of the domestic violence program is less
punitive. Officials recognize that battered spouses are often
financially dependent on their abusers and unlikely to report
violence if they feel doing so will cost an officer his job. Jan
Russell, one of the department's domestic violence counselors, said
abrupt firings can also make officers so desperate they only grow
more abusive.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago police commanders try to recognize and curb potentially
abusive behavior long before it becomes criminal. Nonetheless,
officials of the 13,500-member department, which received 319
domestic abuse complaints against its officers last year, fired
eight for domestic offenses. That same year, New York, a department
nearly three times as large, dismissed seven.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The New York police have tried to balance counseling efforts
with punishments calibrated to the offense.
</P>
<P>
   Kelleher called the zero-tolerance approach ``the easy way out''
because it relieves officials from the difficulties of weighing the
merits of each case. Although there are no guidelines for punishing
officers, many defense lawyers say that Safir has handed out
stricter punishments than his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to do what is the best thing for everyone concerned,''
Kelleher said. ``For the officer, for the victim and for the
department _ with the emphasis on the victim.''
</P>
<P>
   But a review of police administrative hearings shows that
officers found guilty of domestic violence, or of failing to report
their colleagues' abuse, have not been severely punished.
</P>
<P>
   In the Nieves case, the officer was punished no more severely
for the abuse complaint than for the ball park prank, even though
his girlfriend said she had been terrified when he scaled her fire
escape and broke the window to her apartment after a fight. When he
was finally disciplined, police administrators who made the
decision were holding personnel records showing that he had been
placed on modified duty because he was a suspect in the murder of a
previous girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Nieves, who was never charged in the murder, has since been
returned to full duty. Investigators who insisted on anonymity said
that their inquiry has stalled, but that Nieves remains a suspect.
Both Nieves and his lawyer, Joseph Librie, would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   In a second case, two Brooklyn officers pleaded guilty last year
to administrative charges of helping a fellow officer cover up the
shooting of his wife. The officer whose wife was shot, Milton
Calderon of the 72nd Precinct, was fired by a judge who said she
suspected he had been involved in the shooting, which he had blamed
on his 3-year-old daughter. But the two officers who responded to
the Calderon house were suspended for 30 days and placed on
probation for a year, even though the judge found they never
reported the shooting, enabling Calderon to destroy evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Police records also show that since 1995, five officers who
violated court orders of protection were punished by suspensions of
20 or fewer days, the same penalty imposed on officers who lose
their identification cards. In other cases, officers found guilty
in departmental trials of beating their spouses received 15-day
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond disciplining officers, the Police Department offers free
counseling that Kelleher credits with improving, even saving, the
lives of officers and their family members. One of the largest
programs is the Membership Assistance Program that was set up by
the department and the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association in 1994
after a series of police suicides. It deploys 120 peer counselors
in the city's 76 precincts, and they evaluate troubled officers and
make about 400 referrals a year to outside therapists.
</P>
<P>
   But many police officers spurn such counseling, fearing they
will be stigmatized or disciplined if they acknowledge having a
personal problem. One former officer, Ronald Marchetta, has sued
the department, asserting that when he came to the department for
help in his troubled marriage, a police psychiatrist breached the
confidentiality of his therapy and provided the department with
information that was used to force him into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The department said that it plans to expand its recent program
offering stress management training to abusers, and that it may
work with suburban police departments to insure that the city's
department is informed of domestic complaints against officers who
live outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   OPEN SECRETS: Signs of Trouble Go Unnoticed
</P>
<P>
   As more details have emerged about the case of Fitzgerald, who
killed his family and himself, it has become a lesson in how
oblivious officers can be to signs that a colleague's marriage is
in desperate trouble _ signs that experts say officers should be
trained to notice.
</P>
<P>
   Friends of Fitzgerald maintain that neither they, nor the
department, had any way of knowing that he would snap one day and
kill his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one could have foreseen this, never in a million years,''
said Officer Peter Ciaccio, one of Fitzgerald's closest friends.
``They were never that type. I could never see that he would do
this, because he loved those kids. And he loved her, even with
everything that was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Fitzgeralds' stormy marriage was an open secret among
officers in the 34th Precinct, according to police investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Both the officer and his wife had received court orders of
protection. Her relatives say she called the precinct station to
complain. State police were called at least once to the family's
house in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those outward signs, department supervisors said they
were unaware of the strains in the family until Sept. 25, when the
couple's daughter, Ashley Fitzgerald, 7, called 911 in a futile
effort to protect her family and herself from her father's rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of wonder, what will it take to finally make them
deal with this?'' said Dr. Pamm, of the Mayor's Task Force on
Domestic Violence. ``I mean, how many bodies do they need before
they realize it is a major problem?''

DNA TESTS OFFER EVIDENCE THAT THOMAS JEFFERSON HAD AN AFFAIR WITH
HIS SLAVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (js) 
 BY DINITIA SMITH AND NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DNA tests performed on the descendants of Thomas Jefferson's
family and of Jefferson's young slave, Sally Hemings, offer
compelling new evidence that the third president of the United
States fathered at least one of her children as has long been
speculated, according to an article in the next issue of the
scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on blood samples collected by Eugene A.
Foster, a retired pathologist who lives in Charlottesville, Va. The
finding undercuts the position of historians who have long said
that Jefferson did not have a liaison with the slave some 28 years
his junior and confirms, but with a surprising twist, the oral
tradition that has been handed down among Sally Hemings'
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence is likely to send historians scurrying to
re-evaluate Jefferson, particularly his role in the anti-slavery
movement. It may also have a wider resonance. The accusation of an
affair with Hemings, one of several charges considered in a mock
impeachment trial staged by the Massachusetts state Legislature in
1805, was indirectly denied by Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with impeccable timing,'' the historian Joseph Ellis and
the geneticist Eric Lander write in a joint commentary on the new
report, ``Jefferson reappears to remind us of a truth that should
be self-evident. Our heroes _ and especially presidents _ are not
gods or saints, but flesh-and-blood humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's finding rests on analysis of the Y chromosome, an
unusual genetic component because, except at its very tips, it
escapes the shuffling of the genetic material that occurs between
every generation. The only changes on the Y chromosome are rare
sporadic mutations in the DNA that accumulate slowly over
centuries. Male lineages can therefore be distinguished from one
another through the characteristic set of mutations carried in
their Y chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said he began his research almost on a whim, at a
friend's suggestion. He soon grew more serious, and with the help
of many colleagues, has tracked down four male lineages that bear
on the paternity of Sally Hemings' children. They are Jefferson's
lineage, derived from his paternal grandfather; the lineages of Tom
Woodson and Eston Hemings Jefferson, Sally Hemings' oldest and
youngest sons; and the lineage of the Carrs, two of Jefferson's
nephews on his sister's side.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hemings had other children, but they left no surviving
male heirs. The Carrs come into the picture because of the story
spread by Jefferson's heirs that one or the other of the nephews
fathered Hemings' children, explaining their pronounced resemblance
to the Jeffersons.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's samples were analyzed by Christopher Tyler-Smith, a
population geneticist at the University of Oxford in England, and
his colleagues. They found that the Jeffersonian Y chromosome had a
distinctive set of mutations, unmatched in any of 1,200, mostly
European, men who were analyzed by the same method.
</P>
<P>
   The set of mutations on the Y chromosomes of three descendants
of John Carr were almost identical to one another and different
from the Jeffersonian chromosome, ruling out the Carrs as possible
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   The Y chromosome of a descendant of Eston Hemings Jefferson made
a perfect match to Jefferson's, but those of five descendants of
Thomas Woodson were completely different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest and most probable explanations'' for the
findings, Foster and colleagues report, ``are that Thomas
Jefferson, rather than one of the Carr brothers, was the father of
Eston Hemings Jefferson, and that Thomas Woodson was not Thomas
Jefferson's son.''
</P>
<P>
   Lander, a DNA expert at the Whitehead Institute in Boston, said
Foster's evidence showed there was a less than 1 percent chance
that a person chosen at random would share the same set of Y
chromosome mutations that exist in the Jefferson lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Eston Hemings' descendant has this rare
chromosome, together with the historical evidence, seals the case
that Jefferson fathered Eston,'' Lander said.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that Thomas Woodson was not Jefferson's son is
surprising, Foster said, because of the particularly strong oral
tradition that has come down independently in the five lines of the
Woodson family. Woodson, born shortly after Jefferson's return from
his service as minister in Paris, was 12 when James Callender, a
journalist, published accusations in a Richmond newspaper that
Jefferson was Hemings' lover. Shortly afterward, Woodson was sent
off to live with a relative.
</P>
<P>
   One of the blood samples in the study was taken from John
Jefferson, 52, of Norrisville, Pa., who is believed to be a direct
descendant of Hemings through Eston Hemings Jefferson. John
Jefferson's Y chromosome matched blood samples taken from the
lineal descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Jefferson said he was not particularly
surprised at the news that he was descended from a president and
his slave. ``I've known it practically all my life,'' said
Jefferson, who is disabled and does not work. ``I guess I was happy
about it, but not really surprised since I've believed it all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's sister, Julia Jefferson Westerinen, 64, had a more
ebullient reaction. ``Isn't that wild,'' said Ms. Westerinen, who
lives on Staten Island and sells furniture and office equipment to
architects and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known for about 15 years, but I thought I was related to
Jefferson's nephew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gillespie, a lawyer in Richmond who is the head of the
Monticello Association, which includes the descendants of
Jefferson's two daughters, said, ``We've always agreed with
mainstream historians that Jefferson wouldn't have fathered Sally
Hemings' children.'' But, Gillespie said, the DNA results are
``changing my attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said he had always believed that ``Jefferson would
have shown the second set of children love and affection just as he
did the first set. Apparently he was a product of the 18th century,
and had a double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, author of ``American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson,'' (Knopf, 1997), and other Jefferson scholars like Dumas
Malone have long said that Jefferson did not have a relationship
with Hemings. Ellis once dismissed the possibility as ``a tin can
tied to Jefferson's reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the DNA tests have changed his mind. ``This
evidence is new evidence and it seems to me to be clinching,'' he
said. Ellis said circumstantial evidence, including a quotation
attributed to another of Hemings' sons, James Madison, also pointed
to a liaison. ``It includes the timing of her pregnancies, the
physical resemblance of her children to Jefferson and Madison
saying late in life that his mother told him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well before Y chromosome testing entered the picture, a minority
of historians were asserting that Jefferson had the affair, notably
Fawn Brodie, in her book ``Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History.''
Another scholar, Annette Gordon-Reed, an associate professor of law
at New York Law School and author of ``Thomas Jefferson and Sally
Hemings: An American Controversy'' (University Press of Virginia),
said she felt vindicated by the DNA tests. ``If people had accepted
this story, he would never have become an icon,'' Professor
Gordon-Reed said. ``All these historians did him a favor until we
could get past our primitive racism. I don't think he would have
been on Mount Rushmore or on the nickel. The personification of
America can't live 38 years with a black woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The new DNA evidence is likely to renew questions about
Jefferson's position on slavery, Lander and Ellis believe.
``Jefferson's stated reservations about ending slavery included a
fear that emancipation would lead to racial mixing and
amalgamation,'' they wrote in their commentary in Nature. ``His own
interracial affair now personalizes this issue, while adding a
dimension of hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hemings, who was born in 1772 or 1773, was the
illegitimate half-sister of Jefferson's wife, Martha, the offspring
of a relationship between John Wayles and Elizabeth (Betty)
Hemings, a slave. Sally became Jefferson's property when he
inherited the Wayles estate in 1774, and arrived at Monticello as a
little girl in 1776. She was later described by one of Jefferson's
slaves, Isaac Jefferson, as ``mighty near white . . . very
handsome, long straight hair down her back.'' Jefferson's grandson,
Thomas Jefferson Randolph, described her as ``light colored and
decidedly good looking.''
</P>
<P>
   In her early childhood, Hemings probably acted as a ``nurse'' to
Jefferson's daughter, Mary, a custom in slave culture. Then in
1787, Jefferson, a widower, who was then the U.S. ambassador to
France, summoned his daughter Maria to live with him. Maria was
accompanied by her young attendant, Sally, who was then about 13.
Sally's son Madison, who was born in 1805, at the end of his life
said that his mother became Jefferson's ``concubine'' in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In 1789, Sally Hemings returned with the Jefferson family to
Virginia. By then, Sally was 16 or 17, and pregnant, according to
Madison Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Her first child, Thomas, who the new studies say was not
genetically linked to Jefferson, was born soon after her return.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, said later that
the boy looked like his father. ``At some distance or in the dusk
the slave, dressed in the same way, might have been mistaken for
Mr. Jefferson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of Jefferson's relationship with Hemings will only
add to a re-evaluation of Jefferson that has been going on among
historians for some time, Ellis said. ``The take on Jefferson for
30 years or so has become more and more critical,'' he said.
``Increasingly, he is a window in which race and slavery are the
panes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, as portrayed by Ellis and others, was an ambivalent
figure. ``He plays hide and seek within himself,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans, he predicted, would have a kinder reaction
to what he called ``the longest-running mini-series in American
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the larger world,'' Ellis said, ``the dominant response
will be Jefferson is more human, to regard this as evidence of his
frailties, frailties that seem more like us. The urge to regard him
as an American icon will overwhelm any desire to take him off his
pedestal.''

IMMIGRATION, ONCE DIVISIVE ISSUE, IS MUTED
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mich., Ill., D.C., Fla., Texas, Calif., Wyo.)   (jw) 
 By MIRTA OJITO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is the weekend before the elections, and immigration, the
source of much national angst in years past, has disappeared from
the election debate, although not from lawmakers' political
agendas.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year or so, while the nation has focused on the
White House and Wall Street, Congress has quietly scaled back some
provisions of several 1996 laws that were written to discourage
immigration by cutting a range of benefits to legal residents and
stepping up deportation efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The moves, capped by pro-immigration provisions in this year's
budget bill, signal lawmakers' awareness of the growing voting
power of immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of years ago people were advocating to build a wall
around the country,'' said Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., who
introduced several pro-immigration provisions in this year's
spending bill. ``That's no longer the case. Before, we had heard
only one side of the immigration issue. Now, we get to talk about
some of the positive contributions immigrants have made.''
</P>
<P>
   The immigration measures in the budget bill that President
Clinton signed _ allowing almost 50,000 Haitian refugees to stay in
the country, for example, and increasing the number of visas
granted to foreign professionals _ would have been unthinkable four
years ago, when anti-immigration themes dominated political
campaigns nationally, or two years ago, when Congress passed what
many consider the most anti-immigrant legislation in decades.
</P>
<P>
   No one is suggesting that Congress is dismantling those laws,
particularly the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant
Responsibility Act of 1996. Indeed, now that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service is flush with money, most of the harsher
measures of that law are being enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there seems to be a growing consensus among lawmakers
that too much control of immigration is not good _ for politicians,
who recognize that immigrants' votes could be pivotal in some
races; for businesses and the economy, because valued employees
have had to return home and prospective hires have not been granted
visas, or even for the government itself, since control is
expensive and time consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Those assumptions, coupled with good economic news, have led
some anti-immigration members of Congress to take a cautious
approach to immigration issues or ignore them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans are taking a wait-and-see attitude,'' said
Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill., who is pro-immigration. ``They don't
want to offend one side or alienate the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Among some lawmakers, especially those who advocate a hard line
against immigrants, there is a sense that the laws of 1996 were so
sweeping that very little more can be done or added to the debate.
The budget for the Immigration and Naturalization Service, much of
it dedicated to enforcement, now surpasses that of the FBI, and the
agency has more employees than either the Department of State or
Labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Clinton administration took some major steps showing that
it was serious in trying to control illegal immigration,'' said T.
Alexander Aleinikoff, a law professor at Georgetown University and
former general counsel and associate commissioner of the
immigration service. ``Some people are saying, `We've dealt with
the problem. We've done what we can. Let's move on.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the issue of illegal immigration is far from resolved,
Aleinikoff said. There are about 5 million such immigrants in the
United States and no law that specifically addresses what to do
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, lawmakers are sidestepping immigration in their
campaigns, and have been passing legislation that benefits
immigrants and, in some cases, reverses aspects of previous laws.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has restored most of the welfare benefits it took away
from legal immigrants in 1996. Lawmakers also restored some of the
protections that Central American immigrants had lost, therefore
sparing them from deportation. Congress granted amnesty to 150,000
Nicaraguans, 5,000 Cubans and 49,700 Haitians and allowed hundreds
of thousands of illegal immigrants who hope to gain permanent visas
to stay in the United States instead of having to go home to file
their applications, as the 1996 law dictated.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Congress granted $171 million to the immigration
agency to speed the naturalization process and, for the first time
in years, it increased by 5,000 the number of refugees allowed into
the country every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pendulum is definitely swinging our way,'' said Judith
Golub, director of advocacy for the American Immigration Lawyers
Association in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for immigrants as well as those who oppose immigration
say the pendulum began to swing in favor of immigrants four years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The re-election of California's Gov. Pete Wilson, who won in
part by making his anti-immigration platform part of the national
debate, was a signal to immigrants everywhere that unless they
quickly became U.S. citizens, they too would feel the impact of
measures like Proposition 187. The proposition is a California
ballot initiative seeking to deny education, health and other
benefits to illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Many rushed to naturalize and thousands of new citizens were
ready to vote in the 1996 races. The results caught Republicans by
surprise. In California, a newcomer to politics, Loretta Sanchez, a
Democrat, unseated Republican incumbent Rep. Robert Dornan. Clinton
won Florida, in no small part because many more Hispanic voters
supported him than in the previous election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete Wilson brought out the angry white male in California and
used immigration as a hot-button issue to get re-elected,'' said
Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration Forum.
``That brought out the angry new citizen in record numbers to vote
and punish the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Republicans began to change their tune.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Speaker Newt Gingrich set the tone by pledging that his party
would reach out to Hispanic people and members of other minorities.
He hired an aide to oversee this effort and his office began
releasing information translated into Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   And now, running hard against Ms. Sanchez again, Dornan is
calling himself a friend of Hispanic immigrants. In Texas, Gov.
George Bush, a Republican popular with Hispanic immigrants who is
seeking re-election, is spending more money to attract Hispanic
voters than any other politician ever, his campaign advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for immigrants point to Abraham's appointment as
chairman of the Senate subcommittee on immigration as a turning
point. He replaced Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who retired two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   With Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, Simpson was the architect of
some of the more restrictive of the 1996 anti-immigration laws.
Simpson, who vowed in 1995 that there would never be another
amnesty, did not return phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, chairman of the House immigration subcommittee, said in a
statement: ``The passage of a Haitian amnesty reflects year-end
budget deal making and not any change of heart in Congress. There
was little support in the House for amnesty because it will set a
bad precedent and undermines longstanding immigration policy.''

ANALYSIS: IMPEACHMENT THREAT DWARFS OTHER ELECTION ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The candidates may be waging their final campaign
appeals over education, Social Security and tax cuts. But the
ultimate stake in Tuesday's midterm election is the issue that most
congressional candidates have been trying not to mention: the fate
of President Clinton in the face of threatened impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the voters are thinking of this election as a
referendum on impeachment _ and there is ample evidence that they
are not _ the overwhelming view among Democrats and Republicans on
Capitol Hill is that the outcome of the nearly yearlong drama of
Clinton and Monica Lewinsky will be decisively shaped by the
election results.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans' last-minute flurry of television spots raising
the issue _ however subtly and however spottily broadcast _ have
only heightened that expectation, because they make it more likely
that the election will be interpreted in terms of the president and
the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the election outcome, major decisions and political
risks confront everyone, from Clinton to House Speaker Newt
Gingrich to House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, almost as soon as
the votes are counted.
</P>
<P>
   Just two weeks ago, Gingrich predicted that Republicans would
gain a minimum of 10 House seats on and could pick up ``much closer
to 40-plus if everything breaks for us.''
</P>
<P>
   There is now a rough consensus in both parties that if the
Republicans defy expectations and increase their House majority by
more than 20 seats and pick up 5 more Senate seats, they will look
to press ahead with the impeachment of Clinton and will have a
larger pool of votes to draw from.
</P>
<P>
   But if congressional Democrats hold their losses in single
digits, they hope to cut a deal for some punishment for Clinton
short of impeachment. They worry, however, that Clinton could be
emboldened to see a decent election outcome as a sign that he could
win total vindication.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way way this breaks down is if the president
misinterprets the electoral strength of the Democratic Party as
meaning no sanction will be necessary,'' said Sen. Robert
Torricelli, D-N.J., who is likely to help broker any deal.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely election outcome is thought to be a modest
Republican gain in the House of perhaps 10 to 15 seats and in the
Senate of 2 or 3 seats. That would be considered inconclusive.
``Unless these races produce a groundswell that nobody's seeing
right now,'' said Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., ``I would say this would
not be a mandate for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   That could pose a particular problem for Gingrich, who as leader
of House Republicans faces crucial political decisions however
things turn out. An inconclusive or poor showing by Republicans
would mean Gingrich would have to weave a course between moderate
Republicans opposed to impeaching the president and the party's
fervently anti-Clinton conservative base.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Republicans don't win a lot of seats on Tuesday the
question among core Republicans will be, `What has Newt wrought?'
'' said Jay Severin, a Republican political consultant. ``We have a
compromised agenda. We have a bloated big government budget and now
we have an election embarrassment with the steam taken out of
attacks on Clinton.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rich Galen, the head of the Republican Political Action
Committee, said the new commercials were designed to raise
questions about Clinton, but not make the election into a
referendum on the president. ``He's not on the ballot and we didn't
put him on the ballot,'' Galen said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, seeking to turn the commercials to their own
advantage, immediately accused Gingrich _ their favorite political
demon _ of politicizing the impeachment process. ``How can you act
in an impartial way if you are organizing a political campaign to
remove the president?'' Gephardt wrote to Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after Election Day, the House Judiciary
Committee returns to center stage for the most significant
congressional inquiry since the Watergate investigation 24 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Committee Republicans and Democrats each plan to caucus for
strategy sessions soon after the election. On Nov. 16, the full
committee plans to begin formal deliberations or even public
hearings into whether Clinton committed perjury or obstructed
justice by trying to hide his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   There are already signs that the committee is looking to
dispense with the issue quickly in order to move toward a lame-duck
impeachment vote in mid-December before the new 106th Congress
comes into session. Although decisions are not final, Republican
committee aides say they are looking at a short inquiry with few
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are not planning to showcase headline witnesses like
Ms. Lewinsky or Linda Tripp. Instead, they are considering a short
list of witnesses that would include the president's secretary,
Betty Currie; his close confidant, Vernon Jordan; deputy White
House counsel Bruce Lindsey, and Clinton's lawyer in the Paula
Jones sexual harassment case, Robert Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican committee staff member described the circle of
aides as a group that could help make a perjury case against the
president.
</P>
<P>
   But an immediate complication could occur if the White House,
which so far has not tipped its hand, would choose to assert
executive privilege to shield Lindsey or attorney-client privilege
in the case of Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican aide said the committee's majority was examining
whether Bennett's recent letter to Judge Susan Webber Wright of
U.S. District Court in Little Rock, Ark., instructing her to ignore
Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit in the Jones case in which Ms. Lewinsky
denied a sexual relationship with Clinton, ``pierces the veil of
attorney-client privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats face a decision on whether they want to call
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr before the committee. While some
Democrats are interested in putting Starr on the defensive, others
fear that he could make a compelling case against Clinton.
Democrats are also weighing whether questioning Starr would further
polarize the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the committee chairman, was quoted last
week in The Daily Herald, a suburban Chicago newspaper, as saying:
``Our responsibility is simply to impeach or not to impeach. That's
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But even before the election, a handful of other Republicans on
his committee were examining language in the resolution that
authorized the impeachment inquiry that would allow the House
Judiciary Committee to make some alternate recommendation to the
House.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of a status-quo election, both parties have
resumed the search for ideas for censuring Clinton. Under one
proposal, Congress could suspend the statute of limitations on a
perjury charge so that Clinton could still face criminal indictment
after he left office.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican close to the more establishment wing of the party
said, ``The censure-plus scenario is looking more attractive.'' He
said the Republicans would initially demand tough conditions _ such
as stripping Clinton of his presidential pension and perks, and
barring him for life from official visits to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear that conservatives would accept such an
agreement, or that Clinton would. And it may well be that such an
end game can only be fashioned in the Senate, which all sides agree
would not be able to muster the 67 votes to remove Clinton from
office even if the House did vote to impeach him.

AS TEAMSTERS NEAR A VOTE, HOFFA MAKES FINAL PUSH

<TEXT>
<P>
   As soon as James P. Hoffa entered the smoke-filled bar in South
Philadelphia, 80 Teamsters burst into wild applause, with several
rushing up to ask him for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're first and goal to go, and we're ready to score,'' said
Hoffa, who, as the favorite in the race for the Teamsters
presidency, may soon achieve his life's ambition _ taking the helm
of the union that his famous father once headed.
</P>
<P>
   With ballots being mailed Monday to the union's 1.4 million
members, Hoffa is on the final leg of a feverish campaign that
could make him one of the United States' most prominent and
powerful union leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, a 57-year-old labor lawyer from Detroit, went to
Philadelphia on Thursday to receive the endorsement of the
presidents of 12 area union locals, with a total of 36,000 members
_ a group that he said would be crucial to cementing his victory.
</P>
<P>
   One president, Paul Cardullo, had worshipful words about Hoffa's
father, saying, ``If Jim can be half the man his father was, that
would be great for all of us Teamsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Hoffa predicts a decisive victory, some fears remain in
the Hoffa camp that his main opponent, Tom Leedham, director of the
union's 400,000-member warehouse division, might pull off an upset.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has lined up endorsements from the heads of about
three-fifths of the union's 526 locals, but Leedham insists that
the rank-and-file members support him and that the leaders backing
Hoffa will hardly raise a finger to mobilize members for Hoffa.
Votes will be counted early next month, after a monthlong balloting
period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we have developed real momentum; we think we can
win,'' Leedham said. Leedham began as a long shot, but his
campaigning from 4 a.m. to 10 p.m. many days has turned the contest
into a real race, many Teamsters say. Leedham estimates he has
shaken 85,000 hands, campaigning at supermarket warehouses,
fruit-packing plants, truck terminals and United Parcel Service
centers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Leedham's tireless campaigning, Hoffa appears to be in a
much stronger position than in 1996, when he ran against Ron Carey,
the incumbent, losing 52 percent to 48 percent. But federal
monitors overturned Carey's victory, ordered a rerun and later
expelled Carey from the Teamsters after finding that several of his
aides had diverted more than $700,000 in union money to help his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Leedham entered the race after Carey was barred from running
again and has won the backing of many Carey followers. Leedham
remains closely identified with Carey, who appointed him to his
warehouse post.
</P>
<P>
   For this rerun election, Hoffa began as the front-runner because
he had the big name, the big-name endorsements, the big campaign
organization and the big war chest _ his campaign has outspent
Leedham's $800,000 to $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa has promised far-reaching changes if he is elected. Though
he describes himself as a progressive, he promises that the
Teamsters, one of the most generous donors to Democratic
candidates, will become bipartisan. He pledges to unify the union
after years of warring between Carey and the local leaders that the
Carey forces derided as the old guard _ a group that overwhelmingly
supports Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   With a motto of ``Restore the Power,'' Hoffa is also vowing to
restore the Teamsters' influence of old. His father, James Riddle
Hoffa, made the Teamsters the nation's biggest, most powerful and,
law-enforcement officials say, most corrupt union. His father
headed the Teamsters from 1957 to 1971, went to prison for jury
tampering and disappeared in 1975 in what was widely seen as a
gangland murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hoffa name is revered in this union,'' Hoffa said. ``My
father doubled and tripled drivers' wages. I want to carry on
making a contribution.'' But Leedham has repeatedly asserted that
if Hoffa wins, the union will return to its corrupt past, when
union officials made common cause with mobsters, pensions funds
were looted, and dissidents were beaten or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Hoffa Jr. is elected, the Teamsters will go back to the
Dark Ages,'' Leedham, 47, said during a campaign swing through New
York on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than the congressional races going on nationwide,
Teamster politics is raw and muscular. Hardly a day goes by without
Hoffa or Leedham calling each other corrupt or an empty suit.
</P>
<P>
   Leedham asserts that Hoffa has cronies who care more about
lining their own pockets than helping workers. But Hoffa angrily
accuses Leedham of hypocrisy: ``He says he's the so-called reform
candidate,'' Hoffa said, ``but he was elected on Ron Carey's
corruption slate, which stole $1 million from the union. He's
hopelessly tied to Ron Carey.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, a federal election monitor came close to disqualifying
Hoffa from running, because of credibility problems. The monitor,
Michael Cherkasky, found that Hoffa had not testified truthfully
about the source of some campaign contributions, but he nonetheless
decided against barring Hoffa from the race.
</P>
<P>
   Cherkasky allowed Hoffa to stay in the race, saying
disqualification would be anti-democratic because it would deny
members the option of electing a popular candidate. Hoffa has
repeatedly insisted that his testimony was honest.
</P>
<P>
   The driving force behind Leedham has been Teamsters for a
Democratic Union, a Detroit-based group of several thousand workers
that has long fought Teamster corruption. In 1991, the group was
crucial to Carey's first victory, which he won even though he, like
Leedham today, received few endorsements from local presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leedham's gaining ground right now,'' said Ken Paff, national
coordinator of Teamsters for a Democratic Union. ``Hoffa is really
relying on the officialdom, which delivers some votes, but not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa is expected to do best in the Midwest and in long-haul
freight _ his father's strongholds, while Leedham is expected to
fare best among 180,000 United Parcel workers, who were Carey's
base.
</P>
<P>
   There is a third presidential candidate, John Metz, head of a
St. Louis Teamsters local, who has not mounted a serious campaign,
and many Teamsters predict that he will get less than 5 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Paff said Leedham was an obvious choice for his group because he
had vowed to involve rank-and-file workers in national negotiations
and grievance procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have entirely different concepts for unifying the
union,'' Paff said. ``Hoffa means unify the officials. Tom's
concept of unity is to involve the members.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hoffa said his campaign, not Leedham's, was unifying
Teamsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a $10-a-person luau in Chicago that 2,000 people
attended,'' Hoffa said. ``Every weekend I have a rally with 400,
500 Teamsters. I've never heard of him getting many workers to a
rally.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the big question marks about Hoffa is to what degree he
will maintain ties with _ and be beholden to _ friends, supporters
and mentors who have had run-ins with the law and to what degree he
can leave them behind.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades ago, he was an investor in a partnership with
Allen Dorfman, a friend of his father and a mobster who looted
millions of dollars from Teamster pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Hoffa maintains close ties with Larry Brennan, head of
the Teamsters in Michigan, the man who hired Hoffa as his executive
assistant so that Hoffa could qualify to run for the Teamsters
race.
</P>
<P>
   Brennan had a large hand in running a union welfare fund when
federal officials found $725,000 in improper expenses, including
spending on golf outings and adult entertainment. Cherkasky faulted
Brennan for giving union officials more than $30,000 in raises that
immediately went to his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa angrily rejects suggestions that he is beholden to corrupt
individuals, insisting that the only people he will be beholden to
are the rank and file and members of his executive board slate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people's fears about him are warranted,'' said
Greg Tarpinian, president of the Labor Research Association, a New
York-based consulting group. ``I think Jimmy is probably going to
go out of his way _ like Nixon going to China _ to show that he's a
serious guy when it comes to dealing with corruption.''

DNA TESTS OFFER EVIDENCE THAT JEFFERSON FATHERED A CHILD WITH HIS
SLAVE 
</HEADLINE>

 BY DINITIA SMITH AND NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DNA tests performed on the descendants of Thomas Jefferson's
family and of Jefferson's young slave, Sally Hemings, offer
compelling new evidence that the third president of the United
States fathered at least one of her children as has long been
speculated, according to an article in the next issue of the
scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on blood samples collected by Eugene A.
Foster, a retired pathologist who lives in Charlottesville, Va. The
finding undercuts the position of historians who have long said
that Jefferson did not have a liaison with the slave some 28 years
his junior and confirms, but with a surprising twist, the oral
tradition that has been handed down among Sally Hemings'
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence is likely to send historians scurrying to
re-evaluate Jefferson, particularly his role in the anti-slavery
movement. It may also have a wider resonance. The accusation of an
affair with Hemings, one of several charges considered in a mock
impeachment trial staged by the Massachusetts state Legislature in
1805, was indirectly denied by Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with impeccable timing,'' the historian Joseph Ellis and
the geneticist Eric Lander write in a joint commentary on the new
report, ``Jefferson reappears to remind us of a truth that should
be self-evident. Our heroes _ and especially presidents _ are not
gods or saints, but flesh-and-blood humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's finding rests on analysis of the Y chromosome, an
unusual genetic component because, except at its very tips, it
escapes the shuffling of the genetic material that occurs between
every generation. The only changes on the Y chromosome are rare
sporadic mutations in the DNA that accumulate slowly over
centuries. Male lineages can therefore be distinguished from one
another through the characteristic set of mutations carried in
their Y chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said he began his research almost on a whim, at a
friend's suggestion. He soon grew more serious, and with the help
of many colleagues, has tracked down four male lineages that bear
on the paternity of Sally Hemings' children. They are Jefferson's
lineage, derived from his paternal grandfather; the lineages of Tom
Woodson and Eston Hemings Jefferson, Sally Hemings' oldest and
youngest sons; and the lineage of the Carrs, two of Jefferson's
nephews on his sister's side.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hemings had other children, but they left no surviving
male heirs. The Carrs come into the picture because of the story
spread by Jefferson's heirs that one or the other of the nephews
fathered Hemings' children, explaining their pronounced resemblance
to the Jeffersons.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's samples were analyzed by Christopher Tyler-Smith, a
population geneticist at the University of Oxford in England, and
his colleagues. They found that the Jeffersonian Y chromosome had a
distinctive set of mutations, unmatched in any of 1,200, mostly
European, men who were analyzed by the same method.
</P>
<P>
   The set of mutations on the Y chromosomes of three descendants
of John Carr were almost identical to one another and different
from the Jeffersonian chromosome, ruling out the Carrs as possible
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   The Y chromosome of a descendant of Eston Hemings Jefferson made
a perfect match to Jefferson's, but those of five descendants of
Thomas Woodson were completely different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest and most probable explanations'' for the
findings, Foster and colleagues report, ``are that Thomas
Jefferson, rather than one of the Carr brothers, was the father of
Eston Hemings Jefferson, and that Thomas Woodson was not Thomas
Jefferson's son.''
</P>
<P>
   Lander, a DNA expert at the Whitehead Institute in Boston, said
Foster's evidence showed there was a less than 1 percent chance
that a person chosen at random would share the same set of Y
chromosome mutations that exist in the Jefferson lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Eston Hemings' descendant has this rare
chromosome, together with the historical evidence, seals the case
that Jefferson fathered Eston,'' Lander said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that Thomas Woodson was not Jefferson's son is
surprising, Foster said, because of the particularly strong oral
tradition that has come down independently in the five lines of the
Woodson family. Woodson, born shortly after Jefferson's return from
his service as minister in Paris, was 12 when James Callender, a
journalist, published accusations in a Richmond newspaper that
Jefferson was Hemings' lover. Shortly afterward, Woodson was sent
off to live with a relative.
</P>
<P>
   One of the blood samples in the study was taken from John
Jefferson, 52, of Norrisville, Pa., who is believed to be a direct
descendant of Hemings through Eston Hemings Jefferson. John
Jefferson's Y chromosome matched blood samples taken from the
lineal descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Jefferson said he was not particularly
surprised at the news that he was descended from a president and
his slave. ``I've known it practically all my life,'' said
Jefferson, who is disabled and does not work. ``I guess I was happy
about it, but not really surprised since I've believed it all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's sister, Julia Jefferson Westerinen, 64, had a more
ebullient reaction. ``Isn't that wild,'' said Ms. Westerinen, who
lives on Staten Island and sells furniture and office equipment to
architects and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known for about 15 years, but I thought I was related to
Jefferson's nephew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gillespie, a lawyer in Richmond who is the head of the
Monticello Association, which includes the descendants of
Jefferson's two daughters, said, ``We've always agreed with
mainstream historians that Jefferson wouldn't have fathered Sally
Hemings' children.'' But, Gillespie said, the DNA results are
``changing my attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said he had always believed that ``Jefferson would
have shown the second set of children love and affection just as he
did the first set. Apparently he was a product of the 18th century,
and had a double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, author of ``American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson,'' (Knopf, 1997), and other Jefferson scholars like Dumas
Malone have long said that Jefferson did not have a relationship
with Hemings. Ellis once dismissed the possibility as ``a tin can
tied to Jefferson's reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the DNA tests have changed his mind. ``This
evidence is new evidence and it seems to me to be clinching,'' he
said. Ellis said circumstantial evidence, including a quotation
attributed to another of Hemings' sons, James Madison, also pointed
to a liaison. ``It includes the timing of her pregnancies, the
physical resemblance of her children to Jefferson and Madison
saying late in life that his mother told him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well before Y chromosome testing entered the picture, a minority
of historians were asserting that Jefferson had the affair, notably
Fawn Brodie, in her book ``Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History.''
Another scholar, Annette Gordon-Reed, an associate professor of law
at New York Law School and author of ``Thomas Jefferson and Sally
Hemings: An American Controversy'' (University Press of Virginia),
said she felt vindicated by the DNA tests. ``If people had accepted
this story, he would never have become an icon,'' Professor
Gordon-Reed said. ``All these historians did him a favor until we
could get past our primitive racism. I don't think he would have
been on Mount Rushmore or on the nickel. The personification of
America can't live 38 years with a black woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The new DNA evidence is likely to renew questions about
Jefferson's position on slavery, Lander and Ellis believe.
``Jefferson's stated reservations about ending slavery included a
fear that emancipation would lead to racial mixing and
amalgamation,'' they wrote in their commentary in Nature. ``His own
interracial affair now personalizes this issue, while adding a
dimension of hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hemings, who was born in 1772 or 1773, was the
illegitimate half-sister of Jefferson's wife, Martha, the offspring
of a relationship between John Wayles and Elizabeth (Betty)
Hemings, a slave. Sally became Jefferson's property when he
inherited the Wayles estate in 1774, and arrived at Monticello as a
little girl in 1776. She was later described by one of Jefferson's
slaves, Isaac Jefferson, as ``mighty near white . . . very
handsome, long straight hair down her back.'' Jefferson's grandson,
Thomas Jefferson Randolph, described her as ``light colored and
decidedly good looking.''
</P>
<P>
   In her early childhood, Hemings probably acted as a ``nurse'' to
Jefferson's daughter, Mary, a custom in slave culture. Then in
1787, Jefferson, a widower, who was then the U.S. ambassador to
France, summoned his daughter Maria to live with him. Maria was
accompanied by her young attendant, Sally, who was then about 13.
Sally's son Madison, who was born in 1805, at the end of his life
said that his mother became Jefferson's ``concubine'' in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In 1789, Sally Hemings returned with the Jefferson family to
Virginia. By then, Sally was 16 or 17, and pregnant, according to
Madison Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Her first child, Thomas, who the new studies say was not
genetically linked to Jefferson, was born soon after her return.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, said later that
the boy looked like his father. ``At some distance or in the dusk
the slave, dressed in the same way, might have been mistaken for
Mr. Jefferson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of Jefferson's relationship with Hemings will only
add to a re-evaluation of Jefferson that has been going on among
historians for some time, Ellis said. ``The take on Jefferson for
30 years or so has become more and more critical,'' he said.
``Increasingly, he is a window in which race and slavery are the
panes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, as portrayed by Ellis and others, was an ambivalent
figure. ``He plays hide and seek within himself,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans, he predicted, would have a kinder reaction
to what he called ``the longest-running mini-series in American
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the larger world,'' Ellis said, ``the dominant response
will be Jefferson is more human, to regard this as evidence of his
frailties, frailties that seem more like us. The urge to regard him
as an American icon will overwhelm any desire to take him off his
pedestal.''

<P>
   SAN FOCA, Italy _ By day, this seaside resort town in southern
Italy is a shuttered ghost town, with fewer than 700 inhabitants in
the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   At night, the population mysteriously swells. When the sea is
calm, as many as 500 boat people reach the neighboring coast. Many
of the fugitives from Albania, Iraq and Kosovo are pushed or thrown
from bobbing rubber rafts by ruthless Albanian smugglers eager to
escape the police.
</P>
<P>
   Some manage to flee through the woods to seek their fortune as
``clandestini,'' or illegal aliens. Those who are rounded up are
dried off, patched up and temporarily interned on the grounds of
Regina Pacis, a former children's summer camp in San Foca. Others
are less lucky. Last Saturday, two rubber rafts collided as they
left the Albanian port of Vlore, about 45 miles away, across the
Adriatic. Six people were killed, including a 6-month-old baby.
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of refugees and would-be immigrants, their
uncertain fate, and concern over the mafia-controlled and highly
dangerous route they take to reach Italy have brought matters to a
critical point in a country that has become the preferred port of
entry into the European Union for desperate people fleeing war,
political unrest and economic distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is is the exact point where the poverty and wealth of the
world collide,'' said the Rev. Cesare Lodeserto, 38, a Roman
Catholic priest who runs Regina Pacis, Italy's largest refugee
processing center.
</P>
<P>
   Built to house a maximum of 250 people, on some nights Regina
Pacis crams in more than 600. It is run by the Catholic diocese of
Lecce, the provincial capital, relying on volunteers and a state
contribution of $18 a person _ significantly less than what the
church, other charities and local authorities spend to feed, house,
clothe and transport their charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Italian state is everywhere, and it is nowhere,'' Cesare
said sarcastically, as volunteers ladled out macaroni and roasted
chicken prepared by local nuns to a long line of refugees. ``But
what are we supposed to do, leave them in the water?''
</P>
<P>
   In the first first big exodus of boat people from Albania, in
1991, thousands of refugees were welcomed with vats of spaghetti by
local Italians who viewed their arrival as an exciting and
short-lived moment in history.
</P>
<P>
   That euphoria has worn off, and Italians increasingly view the
constant new waves of refugees, some seeking asylum from war zones
and many more fleeing poverty, as a national emergency and a direct
local threat.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, more than 10,000 refugees have been processed
in the province of Lecce alone. On a hot July day, seven Kurdish
refugees washed up on the beach of a popular Club Med in Otranto,
startling the tourists who came out to sunbathe.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the beginning, they came by the hundreds, and we could help
them,'' said Niceta Petrachi, 31, who as the watchman of the local
fishing port has a nightly front-row view of rafts being pursued by
Coast Guard helicopters and navy ships. ``Now there are too many.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We already have huge unemployment here,'' he added. ``We
cannot handle any more foreigners.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, almost all the refugees waiting to be processed at the
Regina Pacis center expressed no desire to stay in southern Italy,
where jobs are scarce and government handouts scanty and available
only for a limited time. Most said they had left Kosovo or Iraq or
Afghanistan with Germany, Switzerland or Britain as their goal, and
Italy merely the Ellis Island through which they had to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Italy has many more refugees and immigrants now
than ever before. In 1997, there were 1.2 million registered
foreigners. The University of Milan's Institute for Statistics
recently estimated that in April this year there were at least
235,000 illegal aliens. Many other experts suspect that there are
many more.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Italy, where unemployment reaches 23 percent and the
mafia is deeply rooted, immigrants are viewed as stealing jobs and
bringing in more organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Some local politicians and many residents say they want the
government to crack down hard on the smugglers who make a fortune
by ferrying passengers across the Adriatic with the same ruthless
efficiency they smuggle arms and marijuana. When the Italian police
boats close in on them, the smugglers sometimes escape by throwing
children into the water to force their pursuers to stop for rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Gianni Vergari, 41, a San Foca bar owner suggested grimly that
authorities ``shoot at the rafts from helicopters after they unload
their passenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next time,'' he said, ``those smugglers would think twice
before coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government is beginning to heed the rising tide of
domestic panic. On Wednesday, the new minister of the interior,
Rosa Russo Jervolino, flew to Tirana, the Albanian capital, and
signed an agreement with her counterparts there to allow Italian
police officers to work alongside Albanian law enforcement
officials at the port city of Vlore, where most of the smugglers
operate in full view of local policemen.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Italian refugee law _ or rather the lack of a clear one _
further complicates efforts to deal with the influx. Italy has an
agreement with Albania that allows it to reject and repatriate
Albanian illegal emigrants. Anyone can apply for political asylum,
although ethnic Albanians from Kosovo stand a better chance than
most because of the unrest there. A new asylum law drafted to help
integrate refugees into society is stalled in Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the waves of immigrants from Albania, the former
Yugoslavia and now Kosovo, the government has passed a series of
temporary measures granting refugees short-term aid and asylum on
humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term help comes from the church, private charities and
the refugees' own survival skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made it this far,'' said Fatmir Mustafaj, 25, a high-school
teacher whose long, dangerous escape from Kosovo included being
robbed at gunpoint by Albanian policemen before he took the boat.
``I'll ask for political asylum or I'll become a clandestino, but
somehow I'm going to Germany to start a new life.''

STAUNCH CLINTON DEFENDER IN TOUGH RACE IN N.C.

<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ Like President Clinton, Rep. Melvin Watt is a
graduate of the Yale Law School, and he ranks among the president's
most steadfast defenders in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   When the House Judiciary Committee begins hearings on the
impeachment of Clinton, Watt, one of the most articulate of the
committee's Democrats, is expected to play a major role. But first
he must win re-election, which is no cinch, although he remains a
slight favorite. Two things have conspired against Watt:
redistricting and a single vote that even he has come to consider
unwise. Together, they have turned him from a sure thing into a
prime Republican target.
</P>
<P>
   Watt has represented North Carolina's 12th Congressional
District for three terms, and for all of that time it was one of
the nation's most derided districts because of its peculiar shape.
It snaked more than 150 miles northeast from Charlotte to Durham,
roughly along the path of Interstate 85 and in some places not much
wider than the highway.
</P>
<P>
   It may not have been exactly a gerrymander, but it certainly
walked and talked like one.
</P>
<P>
   The district contained a black majority; it was designed that
way in response to political pressure, and it gave thumping
majorities to Watt, a black man who fought his way from a house
with no running water to the University of North Carolina to Yale
to Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   But then the courts soured on the district, declaring the
race-based lines unconstitutional, and it has been redrawn twice
since, most recently last spring. The new, more compact 12th (whose
borders are still under challenge in the courts) stretches only
from Charlotte to Winston-Salem. Politically speaking, it is an
altogether different animal, only 34 percent black and only 55
percent Democratic in terms of registration.
</P>
<P>
   As an opponent, Watt has drawn Scott Keadle, a 33-year-old
dentist from Salisbury who has never held public office. He won the
six-way Republican primary with only 28 percent of the vote, and at
first he was woefully underfinanced, lending his own campaign half
the $169,000 it raised by Sept. 30. But then, about two weeks ago,
dollars started rolling in from Washington and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Keadle (the name is pronounced to rhyme with ladle) spent a lot
of the money on a commercial that grabs everyone's attention.
</P>
<P>
   It is based on what one Democrat here called ``a typical Mel
Watt vote.'' A committed civil libertarian, Watt has voted against
bans on guns in urban housing projects, against the fence along the
U.S. border with Mexico, against the anti-terrorism bill and
against ``Megan's Law,'' the measure that requires states to notify
local authorities when sex offenders move into an area.
</P>
<P>
   Watt cast the only vote against Megan's Law.
</P>
<P>
   The vote is devastatingly dramatized in Keadle's spot. A small,
blonde girl is shown skipping along a sidewalk, turning into a
playground and climbing onto a swing. A forbidding-looking man
emerges from behind a tree and walks toward her. Just before he
reaches her, the picture is replaced by the words, ``Mel Watt _ the
only vote against our children.''
</P>
<P>
   In his third and final debate with Keadle here on Tuesday, Watt
at first defended his vote, asking: ``Would the next step be to
register everybody who committed a murder?'' But he later conceded
that the vote had been wrong and said he had since voted twice for
money to cover the cost of state compliance with the law.
</P>
<P>
   When Watt complained about ``scare tactics,'' calling the spot
misleading, Keadle responded: ``We feel like it's a very good ad,
and frankly, it's meant to scare you.''
</P>
<P>
   In his public appearances, Keadle has shown little of the polish
and legal and legislative knowledge Watt displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keadle's not that impressive in person,'' said Tom Kazee,
chairman of the political science department at Davidson College,
``but he's giving Watt a run for his money anyway. These days, you
know, very few people see the candidates in person. It's all in the
TV ads, and if the African-Americans don't come out and vote, Watt
could very well lose his seat.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Watt said he did not see the contest in racial
terms. His problem, he said, was to reach the 55 percent of the
voters whom he had never represented, and to convince them that he
could represent their divergent interests, ``just as I have
represented the interests of inner-city black people along with big
banks and finance houses in Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte is the nation's second-largest banking center, after
New York, and Watt has used his banking friends here to reach out
to conservatives. One important new backer this year is Tom Smith,
chief executive of Food Lion, a big supermarket chain based in
Salisbury, Keadle's hometown. Smith, a frequent contributor to
conservative Republicans, sponsored a $100-a-head Watt fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   But in earlier days Watt sometimes complained bitterly about the
prejudices of white North Carolina voters. When the Supreme Court
ruled his district's lines unconstitutional, he said, according to
The Almanac of American Politics: ``You go down into North
Carolina, and you take a poll, and 30 to 35 percent of the
population will tell you under no circumstances, no matter how
qualified, will they ever vote for a black candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrel Guillory, director of the Program on Southern Politics,
Media and Public Life at the University of North Carolina,
commented: ``You have a nice philosophical question here. Are
blacks better off controlling a few districts or influencing a lot
and winning fewer? I come down against the idea of packing all the
blacks into a few districts.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's tribulations have gone largely unmentioned by the
candidates so far. But the political air in North Carolina is
saturated with Clinton, not only because of the new national
Republican spots but also because Sen. Lauch Faircloth is
bombarding his Democratic opponent, John Edwards, with commercials
linking him to the president.
</P>
<P>
   In one frequently shown spot, the two Democrats grow Pinocchio
noses as the announcer describes them as ``two tobacco-taxing
liberals who have a habit of stretching the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Watt said he half-expected something like that from Keadle over
the campaign's final weekend. Sonny Scott, the Republican's
manager, said, ``The president is relevant to us only in that Mel
Watt has leaned over backward to protect him'' _ which sounds a
little like a line from a commercial.

<P>
   DANVERS, Mass. _ There is a certain feeling of deja deja vu
about the congressional campaign here, north of Boston, in the 6th
District of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dozen or so races that political analysts spotted
early on as worth watching for a possible flip from one party to
another, the contest here is a re-rematch between the Republican,
Peter Torkildsen, the district's delegate to the House of
Representatives from 1992 to 1996, and John Tierney, its current
congressman, who squeaked into office by just 360 votes last time
around.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the race does not look so close. Polls show
Tierney, the Democratic incumbent, with a double-digit percentage
point lead, and predictions are that the 12-member Massachusetts
delegation to Congress will remain pristinely, unanimously
Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   But the 6th District campaign is interesting for another reason.
With each candidate a proven commodity, it comes about as close to
a fight between two incumbents as a campaign can get, each man
defending his own congressional record and attacking his
opponent's. At times, the dueling accounts of each candidate's
record reach such heights that they call to mind the adage,
``Everyone's entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps the most striking aspect of the clashing facts is
that in essence, each candidate is making almost exactly the same
claims: that he is the best advocate for education; that he is most
committed to reforming campaign finance and the health care system;
that he best defended Medicare and Social Security from cuts; that
he best brought federal defense and transportation dollars into the
district.
</P>
<P>
   In the last campaign, Tierney said in an interview, Torkildsen
``was sort of belittling the whole idea that I was focusing on
education; now we hear education is his number one issue, which is
the co-option of all time.'' He added, ``Whenever Newt Gingrich
needed him to cut an education program, he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Torkildsen acknowledged that the thrust of both campaigns'
arguments was similar, but disagreed that he had co-opted anything
in his emphasis on education, Medicare and campaign finance: ``I
don't mind if he wants to run on my issues,'' he said of Tierney.
``America's a free country.''
</P>
<P>
   Tierney accuses Torkildsen of being disingenuous about their
records in Congress, saying that Torkildsen denies or plays down
his own votes to cut Medicare or education while projecting such
votes onto Tierney. Torkildsen denies that he is denying or
projecting. The truth tends to revolve around the complexity of
congressional votes in which sometimes a ``no'' vote is meant to
stop a whole package or to defend a bill against dilution.
</P>
<P>
   It is this kind of campaign that causes political commentators
to note the striking erosion of the differences between Republicans
and Democrats around election time, and to compare the race in the
6th to something closer to a Democratic primary than a general
election.
</P>
<P>
   But there are real differences between the two candidates, as
well. At a debate here in this Boston suburb, Torkildsen emphasized
that he favored returning 5 percent of the federal budget surplus
to taxpayers and eliminating tax rules that can force a person to
pay more married than single. Tierney emphasized his fight against
Republican efforts in Congress to cut money for summer jobs,
literacy, Head Start and other social programs, and pointed out
that he had been awarded perfect ratings from groups that support
the environment, Social Security, labor and education.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference: Tierney has fought for campaign finance
reform in Congress, but his own campaign budget of about $1 million
includes money from political action committees. Torkildsen was not
known as a campaign-finance crusader, but emphasizes that his own
budget of about $900,000 does not include PAC money.
</P>
<P>
   According to an independent poll and another by the Tierney
campaign, the arbiters in all this appear to be preferring Tierney.
A survey of 10 pivotal congressional districts, conducted for the
Reuters news agency by John Zogby International, found Tierney
leading by 21 percentage points. The poll, released Wednesday, was
conducted among 300 likely voters in the district of about 600,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   The marginally Democratic 6th District, which stretches from
Boston's North Shore to the New Hampshire line and mixes fancy
enclaves like Marblehead with working-class towns like Lynn, has
been seen as one of Republicans' two best chances to break the
Democratic domination of the Massachusetts congressional
delegation, whose 10 representatives and two senators are all
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But judging by the polls, that will not happen this time,
despite Torkildsen's arguments that with a Republican majority in
Congress, Massachusetts suffers on things like transportation-money
allocations because it ``doesn't even have someone in the room when
the decision is being made.''
</P>
<P>
   For voters tired of the Tierney-Torkildsen match, there's also
an independent candidate running: Randal Fritz, a conservative whom
many consider the Boston-area answer to Ralph Reed, the former
Christian Coalition leader _ though with the low level of support
to be expected in liberal Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Fritz, who wants to abolish the federal personal income tax and
opposes abortion rights, has a different vantage point on the race.
Republicans and Democrats, he said in the Danvers debate, all have
the same approach: ``If there's something moving out there, tax it.
Tax it to death. Tax it even after it passes away.''

GADHAFI WEIGHS DEAL FOR TWO BOMBING SUSPECTS

<TEXT>
<P>
   TRIPOLI, Libya _ Outwardly at least, nearly everything on
display in Libya these days seems calculated to project defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Posters plastered on downtown streets mock six years of U.N.
sanctions, hailing as heroes African leaders who have flown to
Libya in violation of an international ban on air travel here.
</P>
<P>
   The new backdrop for state television broadcasts is now a map of
Africa, not the Arab world, a slap at Arab neighbors accused of
being too timid to join Libya's quest to get the sanctions lifted.
</P>
<P>
   A sign affixed to the seaside Grand Hotel captures the spirit
exactly, if ungrammatically. ``Hand's Off Libya!'' it declares.
</P>
<P>
   And yet behind this stubborn facade there are indications that
the Libyan leader, Col. Moammar Gadhafi, might at last be close to
accepting a compromise that could bring an end to his country's
isolation, imposed for its failure to hand over two suspects wanted
in the bombing of Pam Am flight 103 over the tiny Scottish village
of Lockerbie in 1988, in which 270 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has sent mixed signals about it, Gadhafi may be
carefully weighing a deal, proposed in August by the United States
and Britain, that would require Libya to surrender the two suspects
for a trial in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has agreed to the offer in principle, after many years of
refusing to hand the suspects over for trial in Britain or the
United States. But it is insisting on certain guarantees, including
a promise that the suspects would serve their sentences in the
Netherlands or Libya if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tripoli-based diplomats say they believe that Gadhafi is
sincere in wanting to go forward with the arrangement, in part
because many ordinary Libyans have begun to get fed up with the
U.N. penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure that the Libyans want to solve the problem,'' a
Western ambassador here said. ``Perhaps at the beginning the
embargo didn't make things too hard for the regime. But over time,
I think, it's becoming harder and harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. sanctions ban only international flights to and from
Libya and the sale of arms and certain other restricted goods.
Other trade, including oil, moves freely between Libya and other
countries by road and sea.
</P>
<P>
   If Libya does not agree to the U.S.-British proposal, the
Security Council has warned that it will consider tightening
sanctions further, with measures that could include a ban on
Libya's sales of oil.
</P>
<P>
   But because backing even for the current measures is clearly
withering not only in Africa but in other countries around the
world, it is far from clear that the Security Council could make
good on that threat. That raises the possibility that even with
discomfort at home, Gadhafi may ultimately conclude that his best
option is to wait the crisis out.
</P>
<P>
   For now, though, one clear indication that Libya is acting in
earnest, diplomats say, is the government's dismissal in September
of a lawyer, Ibrahim Legwell, who for seven years headed the
suspects' defense team.
</P>
<P>
   Legwell had criticized the U.S.-British proposal as inadequate,
and in an interview in his offices here, he said that the fact that
he had been replaced reflected a desire for greater flexibility.
``It seems that the government doesn't like somebody who says no,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   A new team of lawyers, headed by Kamel al-Makhour, traveled to
New York in October to discuss with U.N. legal officials the
arrangements for a possible trial. And in their first televised
appearance in four years, the two Libyans accused of carrying out
the bombing told the London-based Arabic-language satellite channel
MBC in October that they were ready to stand trial if their safety
was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published on Oct. 18 in the Sunday Times of
London, Gadhafi was quoted as saying that he wanted to see an end
to confrontation with the West over the Lockerbie case. ``Our
people want peace,'' he said. ``They want to be friends.''
</P>
<P>
   In another interview, broadcast on Oct. 22 on the BBC, the
Libyan leader Gadhafi distanced himself from whoever may have
carried out the 1988 bombing, saying that the bombers may have been
taking ``their own revenge'' against the United States for its 1986
air and missile raid on Libya.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the fate of the two suspects, Abdel Basset Megrahi
and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah, who the United States and Britain have
said were Libyan intelligence agents. The two were indicted in 1991
after an investigation concluded that they had carried out the
bombing by planting an explosive in a suitcase.
</P>
<P>
   Their former lawyer, Legwell, said that the two men had spent
the last six years ``not in custody exactly'' but without passports
and suspended _ albeit with pay _ from their jobs with Libyan Arab
Airways.
</P>
<P>
   After Libya refused to extradite the two, Britain and the United
States successfully pushed for the U.N. sanctions, which were
imposed in 1992 and include a ban on arms sales and all
international flights. But those measures have failed to persuade
Gadhafi to hand over the suspects and, in the meantime,
international support for the sanctions has withered in some
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Gadhafi himself has violated the flight ban on several
occasions, but the United Nations has responded with little more
than a scolding. And in the last two months, several African
leaders _ including the heads of state of Niger, Chad, Mali, the
Central African Republic, Eritrea, Gambia and Uganda _ have
defiantly traveled to Libya by plane, acts that were officially
condoned by the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-member Arab League has been less daring, trying to serve
as an intermediary in discussions with Britain and the United
States, but choosing at a meeting last month not to flout the
sanctions. It was that decision that infuriated Gadhafi, who during
his 29 years in power has always been an ardent proponent of Arab
unity.
</P>
<P>
   Within a matter of days, the Libyan leader pronounced that ``the
Arab world is finished,'' the map of the Arab world was removed
from state television, and the government announced that it had
eliminated its Ministry of Arab Unity. This week it even advised
the Arab League that it had decided to downgrade its ``permanent''
status at the organization to that of a ``resident delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews here, Arab and Western diplomats acknowledged that
such pique underscored an unpredictability that made it impossible
to know whether Gadhafi would ultimately accept the U.S.-British
plan. But they said they believed that Gadhafi had been genuinely
surprised by the offer, extended on Aug. 24.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although the plan is essentially the same one Gadhafi himself
long proposed, the Libyan leader initially dismissed it as one
bound to be ridden with tricks. It calls for the two suspects to be
tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law and
promises that the U.N. sanctions will be lifted as soon as the
suspects are surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has described the offer as non-negotiable. But
the Libyan leader has raised many questions, including how the
appeals would be handled, where the suspects would be imprisoned if
convicted, and how their rights would be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say they believe that Gadhafi is plainly concerned
that the two men will be used by prosecutors to make a case against
Libya itself, which some in the West believe had a hand in the
bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they say, any Libyan reluctance to accept the deal is
almost certainly counterbalanced by worries that a refusal might
well prompt the United Nations to make good on a threat to tighten
the sanctions, which Libyans see as less and less tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   One Libyan government official, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, conceded in an interview that if Libyans were asked
their frank opinion, the vast majority would say that the suspects
should be surrendered to bring an end to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   While the sanctions do not bar Libya from selling oil, which
provides 95 percent of its export earnings, they have made life
uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of arms and certain other goods, including airplane parts,
are prohibited, and domestic air service within Libya _ with a
territory larger than Alaska _ has ground nearly to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   And since international air travel is also banned, Libyans who
want to travel abroad must begin their journey either by ferry, on
an overloaded vessel that makes an overnight crossing from Tripoli
to the Mediterranean island of Malta, or with an arduous overland
journey across the border into Egypt or Tunisia.

FOR DAILY NEWS READERS, LIST MAKERS `MISINFORMED'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- You must remember this: Humphrey Bogart did
(ITAL) not (END ITAL) say ``Play it again, Sam'' in ``Casablanca.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, enough people thought so that it landed at No. 8 on our
Daily News Readers Poll of the Top-10 Best Movie Quotes of All
Time.
</P>
<P>
   As a newspaper editor told Jimmy Stewart in ``The Man Who Shot
Liberty Valance,'' ``This is the West, sir. When the legend becomes
fact, we print the legend.''
</P>
<P>
   So in a time-honored Hollywood tradition, we will include ``Play
it again, Sam'' on our list with this caveat: Bogey simply said,
``Play it.'' Apparently, as time has gone by, people have been
confused by what was said to Sam the piano player (Dooley Wilson).
So let's clear it up.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman) says, ``Play it, Sam. Play
`As Time Goes By.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Rick (Bogart) says, ``You played it for her. You can play
it for me. If she can stand it, I can. Play it.''
</P>
<P>
   Got it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Play It Again, Sam'' (ITAL) was(END ITAL) a Woody Allen movie,
however, in which a fantasy Bogart (Jerry Lacy) gives Allen advice
on his love life. ``The world is full of dames,'' the fictional
Bogey tells Woody. ``All you gotta do is whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to another Daily News reader favorite, which was
said by Bogey's future wife Lauren Bacall in ``To Have and Have
Not'': ``You do know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? You just put
your lips together and blow.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew! Hot enough for you?
</P>
<P>
   But it's in ``Some Like It Hot,'' where critic Bob Strauss finds
one of his top-10 favorite lines: ``Well, nobody's perfect.'' It's
said by millionaire Joe E. Browne after being informed by Jack
Lemmon, who was posing as a woman, that he couldn't marry him
because he was a man.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Bob's list, we've included favorite lines from some
people around Hollywood. For ``The X-Files'' creator Chris Carter
it was ``we need a bigger boat,'' which was uttered by land-loving
Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) in ``Jaws'' when he got a
close-up of the great white shark while at sea.
</P>
<P>
   We know the feeling. We could have used a bigger paper to get in
all the great movie quotes since the first talkie, ``The Jazz
Singer,'' in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   This whole thing started when a so-called panel of experts
picked their list of the best movie lines to mark the publication
of ``The Guinness Book of Film.''
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 for them was Agent 007's signature line ``Bond. James
Bond,'' spoken by debonair Sean Connery in ``Dr. No.''
</P>
<P>
   We were a bit suspicious, though, about that being the top line.
As it turned out, it didn't even make Daily News readers' top 10.
Was there a bias? Could it be that the Guinness experts, like the
redoubtable supersleuth, hail from the British Isles?
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Daily News readers' No. 1 line is as
American as apple pie, baseball and .357 Magnums. In fact, it is
from Clint Eastwood as Dirty Harry in ``Sudden Impact'': ``Go
ahead, make my day.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a line that everybody has probably used once or twice in
their lives -- probably to their kids. President Reagan even used
it: ``I have only one thing to say to tax increasers: Go ahead,
make my day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Great Communicator, in fact, was probably America's No. 1
chief executive when it came to citing the Hollywood classics. At
Normandy, for the 40th anniversary of D-Day, the former actor
sampled a quote from ``The Bridges at Toko-Ri'': ``I am paying for
this microphone, Mr. Green!'' Another time, defending his Strategic
Defense Initiative, he echoed Luke Skywalker and friends in
declaring, ``The Force is with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another time he announced in a State of the Union address,
``Where we're going, there are no roads'' -- a catch-phrase
borrowed from ``Back to the Future.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, along with our reader choices, Bob Strauss' picks and
those from Hollywood, we've even included some from those silly
twits at Guinness.
</P>
<P>
   And, hey, don't sweat it if some other wise guy informs you no
one ever actually said ``Play it again, Sam.'' Just repeat another
of Bogey's lines from ``Casablanca'': ``I was misinformed.''

   They may be the first septuagenarian action figures ever. As
John Glenn prepared to be catapulted into space aboard the
Discovery shuttle last week, miniature John Glenns began landing on
toy-store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Courtesy of Mattel Inc. and its Hot Wheels label, children can
now play with three tiny versions of the spacegoing senator. There
is John Glenn in the red space suit he is wearing on the Discovery,
John Glenn in the silver space suit he wore when he became the
first American to orbit the Earth in 1962 and, for those youngsters
who get excited by filibustering and fund-raising, John Glenn the
senator, dressed in a navy blue suit and red tie.
</P>
<P>
   Each John Glenn is about 1} inches tall. There is also a 2-inch
model of the Friendship 7 space capsule circa 1962 and a 3-inch
model of the Discovery. The mini-Senator Glenn, however, does not
have his own transportation; maybe Mattel can make a tiny
chauffeur-driven Lincoln Town Car to fill out the set.
</P>
<P>
   The entire ``Action Pack John Glenn, Great American Hero''
collection retails for $4.99. Mattel spokeswoman Sara Rosales said
the company was inspired by the success of its Mars Pathfinder
model last year.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn _ and NASA _ gave permission for the action figures. ``I
think he was very supportive of it,'' Ms. Rosales said. ``He's not
getting any royalties out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosales is hoping that even some members of the over-11 set
may be enticed to buy the Glenn dolls. ``Hot Wheels are basically
for kids,'' she said, ``but I think that because this is real, and
it is a historical event, there will be a little bit of a
crossover.''

SPLIT INFINITIVES: IT'S JUST FINE TO BOLDLY GO

Patricia T. O'Conner is the author of ``Woe Is I,'' a book about
grammar. 
(bl) 
 By PATRICIA T. O'CONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For grammarians, lexicographers and linguists, it's the Thing
That Will Not Die. Just when they think it's buried once and for
all, the corpse rises again to haunt a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   The creature walking among us, if you haven't already guessed,
is the old ``rule'' of grammar that says we shouldn't split an
infinitive. It's been pronounced dead every few years for more than
a century, but it just won't be laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   In the hearts of true believers, it's still a sin to ever put an
adverb (like ``ever'') between the word ``to'' and the infinitive
form of a verb.
</P>
<P>
   The latest post-mortem comes from Oxford University Press, which
publishes the granddaddy of dictionaries, the Oxford English
Dictionary, as well as baby dictionaries of every size and
description.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of Oxford's new dictionaries _ one just published here
and one published in Britain in August _ include usage notes about
the split infinitive that essentially reiterate what their
predecessors have said: Rule? What rule? (Or words to that effect.)
</P>
<P>
   The wording in the new books, the Oxford American Desk
Dictionary and the New Oxford Dictionary of English, is only
slightly stronger than in previous versions, but the message is the
same: If it sounds good to split, go ahead and do it.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford editors didn't expect the new usage notes to excite a
lot of comment. But then, they didn't count on the power of a sales
pitch. ``Infinitives SHOULD be split,'' trumpeted a news release
introducing the British dictionary. The hyperbolic headline not
only overemphasized the issue but also overstated the case.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, what was old news in the world of lexicography _
the demise of the split-infinitive taboo _ apparently came as a
surprise to the English-speaking world at large. The response from
the British press and dozens of American newspapers, as well as
countless Internet users, was a collective ``Good golly!'' The
opinions quoted in the articles ranged from disgust (``I do not
dine with people who split infinitives'') to delight (``I think
it's terrific'').
</P>
<P>
   Frank Abate, editor in chief of Oxford's dictionary programs in
the United States, has spent much of his time lately answering
calls from reporters about the American book. ``You'd think we were
splitting the atom or something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what's all the fuss about? Not much, it turns out.
Grammarians have argued until they were blue in the face that you
can't really split an infinitive, since ``to'' isn't part of the
infinitive. Sometimes it's not present at all. In a sentence like
``I helped him to break the code,'' the ``to'' could easily be
dropped. And in sentences like ``I let him break the code'' and ``I
saw him break the code,'' the infinitive (break) must go it alone.
</P>
<P>
   Technicalities aside, what we call a split infinitive has been
around a lot longer than its detractors. Writers used it with
impunity from the 1300s until well into the 19th century. All that
changed in 1864, when the dean of Canterbury, Henry Alford,
published a widely popular grammar book called ``A Plea for the
Queen's English.'' Alford, a classics scholar who sought to
civilize the English of Shakespeare and Milton by imposing on it
the rules of Latin grammar, couldn't bear to see an adverb slip
between ``to'' and an infinitive. (Latin infinitives, you see, have
no such prepositional markers.)
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1868, grammarians were challenging Alford's edict,
arguing that one can't graft Latin sentence structure onto English,
a language that's essentially Germanic. But the damage had been
done. The ban on splitting infinitives was firmly planted in the
popular imagination. So were other leftover Latinisms, including
the prohibition against ending a sentence with a preposition.
</P>
<P>
   Early in this century, such heavyweights as the linguist Otto
Jespersen, the British lexicographer Henry Fowler and the American
grammarian and philologist George Curme argued that splitting is
not only acceptable but often preferable. Most 20th-century
dictionaries and style guides agree that clarity is what counts.
There's a difference, for instance, between ``He learned to quickly
read'' and ``He learned quickly to read.'' And when ``quickly''
comes at the end, it could refer to either the learning or the
reading.
</P>
<P>
   What won't come quickly, one suspects, is an end to the
splitting headache. George Bernard Shaw, a perennial sufferer, once
complained to The Times of London about an overzealous editor with
a wooden ear: ``There is a pedant on your staff who spends far too
much of his time searching for split infinitives. Every good
literary craftsman uses a split infinitive if he thinks the sense
demands it. I call for this man's instant dismissal; it matters not
whether he decides to quickly go or to go quickly or quickly to go.
Go he must, and at once.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Space codger, strained firsts show progress
 &HT;    By Mark Lane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I am wary of joining groups of people who are looking up in the
air. The trick of looking up in a public place until other people
join in is an old one. I've done it myself. It usually works.
</P>
<P>
   This prank works some places better than others. The east coast
of Central Florida is among the best places on earth to try it.
</P>
<P>
   When you grow up anywhere within 100 miles of launching pads, it
always seems reasonable to be among people craning their necks in a
parking lot. Something might be going off. Even a run-of-the-mill
communications satellite is worth the effort when the sky is right.
At night, the most humdrum weather-satellite launch is a thing of
great beauty.
</P>
<P>
   And although most of the country is forgetting about the space
program, every shuttle launch can still draw people away from their
desks and duties and outside into the air. I believe that anything
that does that is good for society in general. That it has any
other purpose at all is frosting on the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, however, people were reminded anew of the space
program. Taking a quick census of the parking lot during the John
Glenn's second launch into space, I was surprised at the numbers.
Usually, we gather in little knots of three or four. The shuttle
regulars. They consult their watches and listen on their Walkmen
and crane their necks looking up southward, above the trees.
</P>
<P>
   This time, though, our numbers multiplied with newcomers. There
were four times more, crowding the good spots. People who normally
are too busy to go outside oohed and aahed when the shuttle's
bright, copper-colored flame rose above the treetops, pluming a
vapor trail behind it into a cloudless sky. A perfect launch from a
strictly plume-and-flame enthusiast's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   I have been doing this routine for as long as I can remember. I
stood among the kids in the front lawn of my elementary school for
the early Apollo flights, even the ones that didn't go to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Any move out of the classroom, even walking single-file to
squint into the sky, seemed like a holiday. And that the single,
steady fingernail-length flame of orange carried actual people
seemed unbelievable. The outdated textbooks left behind on our
desks carried pictures of ships and planes and locomotives as the
acme of human technical achievement. But here, we were looking at
people unseen riding atop flame and smoke that arched through our
very own playground sky.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing. It suggested the world held far more possibilities than
schoolbooks were letting on. It made ``astronaut'' seem like a
valid job-description.
</P>
<P>
   We are not as easily impressed these days. My kids must be
marched outside to witness this.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, once the first American in orbit, is reduced to being the
first American-old-enough-to-get-half-off-at-the-movies in orbit.
As the fireworks grew larger, the records got smaller and more
specific. Well before Glenn's second flight, firsts were getting
strained. One expects to see the first left-handed, dyslexic,
red-haired person in space; the first heavy-metal bass player in
space, the first lesbian vegetarian with a concealed-weapon permit
in space ...
</P>
<P>
   Every shot a first.
</P>
<P>
   The firsts are wan attempts to keep the attention of a fickle
public. That it worked this time was attested by the crowd of
office workers out in my parking lot. And the First Codger in Space
is a neat twist as well as an act of justice toward Glenn, who had
been grounded before his time.
</P>
<P>
   But if the process is routine, it must mean people are going
into space for real. The strained firsts can't stave that off
forever. Rather than try to avoid it, we should celebrate it.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, space travel bores those people who normally stay in
buildings during launches. That's because we have actually achieved
some part of a future people only imagined when I was a child
watching vapor trails -- a time when space shots would be routine
and hardly noted, when we would call astronauts boring things like
``mission specialists'' and the satellites would run on time.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other parking lot regulars, I am impatient for what
will bore people next and will be glad for an unobstructed view.

 &HT;    Commentary: Small, cramped and buck naked
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, France _ For my last night in Europe, I again had
reservations at the left-bank Hotel Claude Bernard next to Sorbonne
University in the artistic and cultural heart of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   This pleasant 34-room hotel, with balconies overlooking the busy
Rue des Ecoles, is an easy walk to the Pantheon, Notre Dame,
Luxembourg Gardens, Saint-Germain-des-Pres and the Latin Quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But I changed my reservations to the Holiday Inn at Charles de
Gaulle airport where I will give Continental Airlines an
opportunity to lose my bags twice in one trip.
</P>
<P>
   Hotel Claude Bernard has a lot of Old-World charm. But after two
weeks of hotel hopping in four counties, I want to spend my last
night in Europe in a hotel that has wash cloths, big towels, a big
bath tub, a big bed and big elevators. I also want a big American
breakfast with hot, cooked food.
</P>
<P>
   I stayed in hotel rooms in Europe so small that federal judges
in the United States would rule them unconstitutional for convicted
killers.
</P>
<P>
   American horse troughs have more room than some European bath
tubs. I took showers in enclosures no bigger than a coffin, which
happens to be the size of the elevator at Hotel Claude Bernard.
</P>
<P>
   Even some expensive European restaurants have tiny tables pushed
so close together that you could fill your glass with wine from the
table on the right and get another roll from the table on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans evidently are used to living in tight quarters. Many
European buildings, streets and roads are hundreds of years old.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, people were smaller centuries ago. And there
was no reason to build streets or roads any wider than needed to
accommodate foot or wagon traffic. Those same buildings, streets
and roads are used today all over Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Most European cars are small by American standards because only
small cars can maneuver through the narrow streets in Paris and
other European cities and villages.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of a Lincoln Town Car in Paris would run out of gas
before locating a parking space big enough to dock a boat that
size.
</P>
<P>
   The abrupt switchbacks on narrow Alpine roads require cars with
an extremely tight turning radius. A Chevrolet Suburban would be
the wrong choice to tackle back roads through the European Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is due to living cheek-to-jowl or some other reason,
Europeans have a different attitude about their bodies. Nudity is
so common in Europe that you begin to think they were born that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Statues of buck naked people are everywhere in Europe. Most of
the art in Europe features naked people. There's a lot of art in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   European TV programs always seem to work in a few naked people.
</P>
<P>
   I've often wondered if American censors were cutting out some of
the more interesting parts of Paris fashion shows. Now I know. They
were.
</P>
<P>
   Books, magazines and postcards that would prompt outraged
picketers in the United States are displayed front and center in
European newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   When the friendly folks at Continental Airlines lost my luggage
on a direct flight from Houston to Paris, the friendlier folks at
Air France gave me an emergency kit to take care of some of my more
basic needs until my bags showed up. Included with the razor,
shaving cream, toothbrush, toothpaste and other emergency items,
was a packet of condoms. The Christian Coalition would suffer an
apoplectic meltdown if that happened on American soil.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it odd that teen pregnancy rates are so much lower in
Europe than in the United States? It makes you wonder who has the
healthier attitude about sex.
</P>
<P>
   I'll study this a bit more tonight on my big TV in my big
Holiday Inn room with big towels, a big bath tub and a big bed.

 &HT;    Anti-Sharp ad on Mexican radio in dispute
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A stinging political ad being broadcast into
Texas border towns from at least two Mexican radio stations touting
Libertarian Anthony Garcia for lieutenant governor says Democrat
John Sharp believes Mexican children are uneducated and have
criminal tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Garcia, who's been ruled ineligible to be lieutenant
governor because he is too young, said Friday he knows nothing
about the ad and wants it pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Ramirez, manager of XHMW and XHAS in Nuevo Laredo, said
Strategic Media of Arlington, Va., purchased airtime for the spot.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic Media has done work for Republican Rick Perry in the
race, but his campaign denied any involvement with the ad.
Political analysts believe any support for Garcia would come from
Hispanic Democrats at the expense of Sharp and to Perry's benefit
in the tightly contested race for the state's No. 2 office.
</P>
<P>
   Perry spokesman Ray Sullivan said Strategic Media works for
other clients and handles ``millions of dollars in advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We had nothing to do with that ad,'' Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked who would air it, Sullivan said, ``I wouldn't put
anything past the Sharp campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and Sharp spokesman Kelly Fero said they believe the ad
came from Perry's camp. Unlike political ads on American broadcast
stations, the Spanish ad doesn't include a disclaimer identifying
its source.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly all sounds like it comes from Perry's campaign,''
Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Fero called it incredible that Sullivan would suggest Sharp
aired the ad against himself.
</P>
<P>
   A person at Strategic Media declined comment, and messages left
for company officials were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saying Sharp thinks Mexican children are
uneducated and have criminal tendencies, the ad said Sharp believes
Mexican workers are unskilled and uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's send John Sharp and the rest of those Democrats a
message. This year let's vote for the independent candidate for
lieutenant governor, Anthony Garcia,'' the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said even if Libertarians placed the ad without his
consent, it would not have called him an ``independent'' candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the ad's accusations, Fero said Sharp had statements
regarding the need for an educated work force taken out of context
several months ago.

 &HT;    Lawmaker hoping to retain seat, but district lines are against
him
 &HT;    By Ken McCall
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ohio's 6th District, a sprawling 14-county area
that covers most of southern Ohio from Marietta to Lebanon, has
been called a political killing ground _ and for good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Since the congressional district's boundaries were redrawn in
1991, no incumbent has managed to win an election.
</P>
<P>
   That's something Democrat Ted Strickland, a 57-year-old
psychologist and former minister, hopes to change with his
down-to-earth style and solid track record. But, while observers
give the incumbent from Lucasville a slight edge, nobody's betting
the farm on him.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Strickland faces a capable and articulate
challenger in 49-year-old Lt. Gov. Nancy Hollister, who has long
been a presence in southeastern Ohio politics.
</P>
<P>
   But Strickland also has to beat the history. Incumbents find it
easy to lose here, political analysts say, because the district is
so exquisitely _ some would say precariously _ balanced.
</P>
<P>
   John Green, director of the bipartisan Bliss Institute at the
University of Akron, says the race has national significance and is
being closely watched by political analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That district is maybe the best example of a swing district in
the entire country,'' Green says.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans can win there, they could win in a lot of
places. Or put it this way: to pick up a lot of seats, they have to
win in places like the 6th.''
</P>
<P>
   So national political organizations have targeted the district.
Besides the $1.5 million raised in almost equal proportions by the
candidates, national parties are pouring money into the race.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee has spent close to $800,000 on
so-called issue ads that attack Strickland and praise Hollister,
but don't urge the viewers to vote for or against either one. The
National Education Association and the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee, meanwhile, have spent about $280,000 on
Strickland, his campaign says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority
Whip Tom Delay have turned out to campaign for Hollister, while
first lady Hillary Clinton is scheduled to visit Ohio University in
Athens today to support Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   All to try to get an edge in the backwater 6th District, which
has no major population centers and, according to the 1990 Census,
a median household income of $21,761.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategist Jim Tilling, who helped redraw the
district's boundaries as chief of staff for the Ohio Republican
Caucus, says the 6th is ``as close to balanced politically as you
can find.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the Democrats tend to be conservative,'' Tilling
says. ``Either party can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland already knows the perils of the 6th District all too
well.
</P>
<P>
   He has run for the office six times. After losses in 1976, 1978
and 1980, Strickland won in 1992, lost in 1994 to Frank Cremeans
during Gingrich's ``Republican revolution,'' then defeated Cremeans
in 1996. All three of the elections since the district was redrawn
in 1992 were decided by a 51 percent-49 percent margin.
</P>
<P>
   On such a level playing field, in a race between two perceived
moderates during decent economic times, almost everyone agrees the
outcome will probably come down to who turns out to vote. :
</P>
<P>
   Will demoralized Democrats stay home because of the Clinton
scandals? Or will frustrated conservative Republicans sit it out
because their two favorite candidates _ Cremeans and newcomer Mike
Azinger _ split the majority of the primary vote, allowing
Hollister to win?
</P>
<P>
   To Tilling, who is chief of staff for Republican Ohio Attorney
General Betty Montgomery, Hollister may have a bigger problem.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clinton scandal makes a difference anywhere, he says, it
will in the 6th District.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's your classic, small-town, family values area, . ''
Tilling says.
</P>
<P>
   But the bruising Republican primary, he says, may have more of
an impact. Azinger and Cremeans made the abortion issue a litmus
test. Hollister, who supports abortion rights, took 39 percent of
the vote to Cremeans' 35 percent and Azinger's 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although Azinger endorsed Hollister last week, Tilling says such
a last-minute endorsemenp`Z.H0`probably not going to matter a lot''
to committed anti-abortion voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a Republican (in the district) if you can't keep the entire
Republican base on your side, you've got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, of the Bliss research institute, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lieutenant governor is a very strong candidate,'' said the
political scientist, ``but she doesn't necessarily appeal to the
conservative Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, nevertheless, sees the race as too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he says, the campaign could hinge on which
battleground the candidates choose.
</P>
<P>
   If the election is fought on economic issues, as Bill Clinton
made sure it was in 1992 and 1996, Green says, the district tends
to vote Democratic. If the election if fought on cultural issues,
as Gingrich made sure it was in 1994, the district swings to the
Republican side.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, without abortion dividing the candidates and with
Gingrich asking Republican candidates to back off impeachment of
Clinton, many of the talking points at the series of 14 debates
around the district have been economic.
</P>
<P>
   But even there, Hollister and Strickland don't necessarily
clash.
</P>
<P>
   Both, of course, are all for bringing more jobs to the
economically depressed, rural district.
</P>
<P>
   And both take unsurprising stands in favor of saving Social
Security, scrapping the current federal tax code, passing campaign
finance reform and helping public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Where they do differ, the issues tend to be less
bread-and-butter.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland, for example, opposes the North American Free Trade
Agreement, while Hollister supports it.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant governor distrusts the United Nations, while
Strickland supports it.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister supports school vouchers and Strickland opposes them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most contentious issue of the campaign, however, has
been Hollister's scuttled move to change highway financing
priorities in Southeastern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is a complicated federal highway dollar shuffle that
Hollister tried to get through Congress _ without going through the
body designed to oversee economic and highway development in the
region, the Appalachian Regional Commission, nor her congressman,
Strickland. Working with Republican congressmen, Hollister got her
proposal into the final federal appropriations bill in October.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland decried the maneuver as ``sleazy politics,'' enlisted
the White House to threaten a presidential veto, and got the item
deleted from the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the candidates have been using the issue to bash
each other's vision and integrity.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland admits that his opposition to the proposal could hurt
him in some counties ``because of the way she's going to present
this.'' And he knows from experience that it wouldn't take much to
tilt the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   But early polls have given him confidence. An August survey had
him up 18 points, he says. But that was before the hundreds of
thousands of dollars in ``unanswered TV time'' purchased by the
National Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted for his campaign Oct. 25 and 26, Strickland
says, shows him up by only 6 points.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister, meanwhile, calls the race a ``dead heat,'' a claim
that was supported by a Reuters/Zogby poll that found only a
statistically insignificant 1.5 percent gap between the two. The
Reuter's poll of 300 likely voters conducted the same days as
Stickland's poll found the congressman with 42 percent, Hollister
with 40.5 percent, with a margin of error of 5.7 percent. The poll
also found 17 percent of the voters were still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   So the candidates are campaigning furiously this weekend,
burning up southern Ohio's country roads in pursuit of those fickle
6th District voters.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland began a 14-county bus tour Thursday that will end
Monday in South Lebanon with a 5:30 p.m. rally at the Village Park.
Along the way he is scheduled to be joined Sunday at Ohio
University by Hillary Clinton and later by United Mine Workers
President Cecil Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Hollister will also be rolling from Marietta on Saturday, where
U.S. Rep. John Kasich will join her for a rally, to Lebanon on
Monday, where she'll eat ice cream and visit with county officials,
to Pleasant Plain later that afternoon where she'll appear with
John Linder, chairman of the National Republican Congressional
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And both campaigns are laboring mightily to deliver their
supporters to the polls. In a district with such razor-thin margins
of victory, every vote counts.
</P>
<P>
   Strickland, working hard, is under no illusions: ``I could still
lose this election,'' he admits.

 &HT;    Scaggs slaying motive hinted
 &HT;    By Leah Quin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the first hint of a motive in the killing of
Penny Scaggs, prosecutors introduced a friend of the slain woman
Friday who said she raised the question of Roger Scaggs' infidelity
two months before his wife's death.
</P>
<P>
   But jurors heard only a brief statement about the possibility of
an affair before Scaggs' attorneys objected, saying the testimony
was hearsay.
</P>
<P>
   After sending the jury out of the room, Travis County District
Judge Jon Wisser decided Mary Lowery could only tell jurors what
she observed the last time she saw Penny Scaggs, during lunch with
a mutual friend in January 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Scaggs, a data-processing executive, is on trial for his
wife's murder. Penny Scaggs, known as a devout woman, was found
bludgeoned and stabbed March 6, 1996, in their Southwest Austin
home.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery, a nurse at St. David's Hospital who knew Penny Scaggs
for more than a decade, told jurors her friend seemed
``disappointed in an aspect of her marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   While the jury was out of the courtroom, Lowery told prosecutor
Bryan Case Jr., some of the details that led to her asking Penny
Scaggs whether Roger Scaggs might have been involved with another
woman.
</P>
<P>
   When their mutual friend said Roger Scaggs had been too busy to
visit his wife in the hospital, Penny Scaggs looked down and
laughed slightly, ``which I had never seen her do,'' Lowery said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Scaggs had earlier told Lowery she wished to travel more
with her husband, but he didn't always want her to.
</P>
<P>
   That January day, she said he was traveling far more than usual,
Lowery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not the kind of person who'd tell you, 'I'm so upset.
I'm so mad at him,''' Lowery said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you could tell she was hurt?'' Case asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Lowery replied.
</P>
<P>
   Before the jurors were sent out, Lowery also told them she took
Penny Scaggs' Bible-based course on being an ideal wife. Case asked
whether the course ever dealt with abusive marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said the course never addressed marriages ``that were
basically over or where there was no hope.'' She added, ``There was
always hope from Penny's standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Scaggs never looked at Lowery during her testimony in
front of jurors, apart from when Case asked her whether she knew
the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Later that afternoon, the defense landed its first blow in a
debate over blood and other material found at the murder scene.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said the unknown material is not human DNA, and
a medical examiner testified Thursday that he thought it was
contamination from forensic tools.
</P>
<P>
   But Scaggs' attorneys have said it's definitely human DNA _
although no one knows whose it is _ and proves the existence of
someone else who might have killed Penny Scaggs.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors questioned a forensic pathologist, Karen Lindell,
who analyzed a blood-covered necklace found on a kitchen counter in
the Scaggs' home.
</P>
<P>
   Lindell said the DNA from the blood was consistent with Penny
Scaggs' type.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously prepared to cross-examine Lindell, defense attorney
Randy Leavitt then asked her about her analysis of Roger Scaggs'
blood and saliva.
</P>
<P>
   She said there was no evidence of Roger Scaggs' DNA on the
necklace or on any other evidence analyzed in the case, although
several items do contain DNA from more than one person.
</P>
<P>
   Using an enlarged copy of Lindell's report mounted on
posterboard, Leavitt listed the evidence, which included Penny
Scaggs' wedding ring, blood from the kitchen counter, Penny Scaggs'
fingernail clippings and latex gloves that earlier witnesses said
contain Roger Scaggs' fingerprints.

   The 32,000 runners in Sunday's New York City Marathon will be
cheered by 2 million spectators, serenaded by 40 bands, hydrated at
24 water stations and tinctured at two dozen medical stations. But,
alas, there will be no oyster tent at Mile 25.
</P>
<P>
   While New York's is one of the world's great marathons, it is
not one of the most exotic. Even with the breathtaking start on the
Verrazano-Narrows Bridge and the Spandex pulse through the city's
five boroughs, New York remains a standard 26.2-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   For those who crave the slithery slide of mollusks instead of
the chewy energy of Power Bars for that final surge across the
finish, the Marathon des Chateaux du Medoc in France's Bordeaux
wine country is the place to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only run New York and Boston so many times,'' said
Thom Gilligan of Boston, who has run 60 marathons and operates a
tour company specializing in exotic races. ``You need something
else to pique your interest.''
</P>
<P>
   A race that gives an entirely new meaning to the term runner's
high is the Medoc marathon, held north of Bordeaux on the first
Saturday in September. The course winds through 53 vineyards and
features wine stops at every mile. While the average marathon
offers water and Gatorade, Medoc tempts with Lafite-Rothschild,
Pichon-Longueville, Latour and Mouton-Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say anyone was drunk,'' Gilligan said. ``When
you're dehydrated, that stuff goes right into your system. But in
1996, there were two women who stopped 13 times to take a sip, just
to say they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Mile 25, for those who just can't force down another one of
the thousands of orange slices offered, runners are invited to stop
at a tent that serves oysters.
</P>
<P>
   ``An oyster is the last thing I'd want to eat at 25 miles,''
Gilligan said. ``But this year, a lot of people stopped and talked
about how good they were.''
</P>
<P>
   If the field of 7,500 does not run under the influence of
alcohol, it definitely runs under the influence of French
inscrutability. About 75 percent of the runners competed in
costumes this year, Gilligan said, many of the men in drag. Then
there were the runners from Brittany disguised as Dalmatians,
pushing a replica of Cruella de Vil's car and barking at everyone
along the course. Other runners dressed as grape pickers, wine
bottles and corks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It can get crazy running 26 miles and trying to look good in a
costume,'' Gilligan said.
</P>
<P>
   For those who prefer the terrain more chilled than the wine, The
Last Marathon is held in Antarctica in February, which is summer in
the Southern Hemisphere. The event is called The Last Marathon,
since Antarctica is the last place in the world anyone would think
of running one.
</P>
<P>
   For $4,000 to $5,000, runners fly to Tierra del Fuego and take a
44-hour boat ride to King George Island off the Antarctic
Peninsula, where the race course takes them up a glacier, over
streams, rock fields and crevasses in temperatures that range from
20 to 35 degrees. The spectators include seals, penguins and
divebombing skuas.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every two steps up the glacier, there was one step back,''
said Lynda Churchfield of Lake Charles, La., who ran the very first
Last Marathon in 1995. ``You never know if your foot will go
through the ice. One lady ran into mud, lost her shoe and couldn't
continue. But seeing the penguins and walruses is amazing. It's a
once in a lifetime race.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Churchfield has also run the Marathon des Sables in Morocco,
which is a seven-day, 150-mile race across the Sahara Desert in
temperatures reaching 120 degrees. Runners carry their food in
backpacks, sleep in tents made from burlap sacks and resign
themselves to becoming human blisters. An Italian runner was
reportedly found wandering two weeks later with a nomadic tribe.
</P>
<P>
   In a few days, Ms. Churchfield will embark on the Himalayan Trek
and Run, a six-day, 100-mile adventure at altitudes reaching 11,800
feet along India's border with Nepal. Included is a 26.2-mile run
called the Everest Challenge Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know what tomorrow will bring,'' said Ms.
Churchfield, who is 48 and seeking to run a marathon in all 50
states by the age of 50. ``Your knees could give out or you could
get hit by a car. You might as well do it while you can. Of course,
I have certain requirements for these races. I want to live
afterwards.''

RUSSIAN RECOVERY PLAN LEAVES BIG QUESTIONS UNANSWERED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Seven weeks after it took office in the midst of a
deepening financial crisis, the Russian government Saturday
approved the first draft of a recovery plan that calls for more
public spending, and tighter government control of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary document, which has yet to be officially
disclosed, has already been dismissed by a visiting team from the
International Monetary Fund, which said in a statement Friday night
that the government has not tackled several important issues,
including a ``realistic budget'' for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   At a Cabinet meeting Saturday, Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said the document was not so much a program, as ``a system of
measures that will be modified and supplemented in the course of
work.'' Final revisions are to be made by Nov. 5, after which the
plan will be published.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, at a news conference, said the plan calls for greater
support for domestic industry, more vigorous tax collection, and a
pledge to pay pensions and government salaries on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the state, especially in such a serious period as
the one Russia is going through, consists of bringing about
economic order,'' he said. But Primakov insisted that his program
will not set off inflation, or turn its back on Russia's
free-market reforms. ``Without doubt, the market will remain,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But without the details, or a budget, the program outlined by
Primakov Saturday left unanswered the main questions that have
dogged his coalition government as it tries to satisfy both its
domestic constituents and its foreign creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Winding up a 10-day working visit to Moscow on Saturday, the IMF
team expressed its perplexity at the Russian government's dawdling
approach. In its statement Friday night, the team said it had
submitted its recommendations and commented ``extensively'' on the
government's preliminary proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there was a common view on the desirable objective for
economic policy through the end of next year, the necessary policy
measures are still under consideration in important areas,'' the
statement said. In particular, the IMF said it would want to see a
realistic 1999 budget before it returns to Moscow for further talks
on the distribution of a pending $4.3 billion loan to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov told reporters Saturday that he still hoped to receive
support and aid from abroad. ``But we will not get on our knees and
beg,'' he said. ``Russia will get on its feet anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Various plans to fight the crisis have been floated in the
Russian media over the last few weeks, including some that have
later been denied by top officials. The latest version appeared
last week in the daily newspaper Kommersant but critics of the
government have held their fire this time, waiting to see an
official document before making their comments.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has pulled back from some of its more
controversial notions _ such as limiting Russians' access to
foreign currency _ the Primakov program leans strongly toward more
spending and more government intervention, against the advice it
has received from its Western creditors.
</P>
<P>
   In comments made earlier last week, Primakov said that ``the
state must determine the parameters and trends in industrial
restructuring,'' particularly in those enterprises where the
government still has shares. He and his ministers have also
repeatedly said that they expect to print money _ but just enough
to pay government debts, without triggering spiraling inflation.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Dmitri Vasilyev, chairman of the Russian Federal
Securities Commission, questioned government forecasts that
inflation next year would not exceed 25 to 30 percent. He said if
the government goes ahead with plans to increase minimum wages and
pensions, and to repay some of the short-term debt frozen since
Aug. 17, those inflation predictions need to be revised. ``We need
to be honest,'' Vasilyev said.

 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Several years ago, George Kirgo, a respected
72-year-old television writer who had worked on such shows as
``Mary Tyler Moore'' and ``Wagon Train,'' proposed a
movie-of-the-week idea to his agent, who took it to a network
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kirgo's too old,'' the executive said immediately, according
to Kirgo.
</P>
<P>
   The agent inquired, ``Does that mean in a couple of years you
won't let me come and see you even though I got you your job?''
</P>
<P>
   The executive replied: ``That's true. Sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no place quite like Hollywood for its obsession with
youth _ but anguish about getting older is hardly limited to
well-known actors and actresses surgically carving up their faces
to look younger. Writers over 50, especially on television, are
virtually shut out of many top shows because they are considered
too old and too out of touch by network executives and producers
who are in their 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   A report last week by the Writers Guild of America, the union
that represents writers, found that while women and members of
minority groups have made some gains in Hollywood over the last
decade, the job prospects for older writers have seriously
declined. In fact, past the age of 30, the report said, the rate of
employment for writers decreases. Last season 77 series had no
writers over 50, the study said; prime-time shows like ``Friends,''
``Men Behaving Badly'' and ``Veronica's Closet'' had no writers
over 40. (Shows without any female writers included ``Politically
Incorrect,'' which has 22 writers.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know writers who have taken `M.A.S.H' off their resumes
because it makes them too old,'' said Larry Gelbart, the
70-year-old creator of the series. ``There was `Red Channels' in
the '50s,'' he said, referring to the booklet that named alleged
communists in the entertainment industry. ``Now there's gray
channels.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other comparisons with the 1950s. Blacklisted writers
sometimes used fronts, or names of friends, to write scripts.
Nowadays, older writers sometimes bring in their sons or daughters,
and pretend they're partners, to pitch meetings with network
executives. Sometimes an older writer who has an idea for a show
asks a young writer to join him and make the pitch so the network
executive will feel more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel more at ease with the guys and gals they went to
school with,'' said Kirgo. ``They also feel that the older you get
you're less in tune with your wit and sexuality. You can't write
love scenes. It's beyond your ken. It's one of the few businesses
where the more experience you have, the less useful you are.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the prospects for older writers are poor was
underlined by the recent saga of Riley Weston, a 32-year-old who
posed as 19 to get a job as a writer and actress on ``Felicity,'' a
show aimed at teen-agers. Ms. Weston was hired because of her
``unique perspective'' as a teen-ager. In fact, if she had been
truthful, she probably wouldn't have been hired.
</P>
<P>
   Film studio executives and producers are, by most accounts,
biased toward young writers, but the bias in the movie business
seems less harsh than in the television arena. After all, not every
film is made for teen-agers. Many of the best-known screenwriters
are in their 40s, 50s and even 60s. They write scripts on their own
and sell them to studios. Television writers, in contrast, work in
groups on specific shows _ and there aren't many shows for older
people.
</P>
<P>
   The decline of network television audiences and revenue has led
programmers and advertisers to focus on viewers between 18 and 49.
And since so many hit shows are geared to the young, network
executives are insisting that only the young can write for the
young.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote for `Sanford and Son,' and I wasn't black, I wrote for
Shari Lewis, and I wasn't a puppet,'' said 66-year-old Saul
Turteltaub. ``You don't have to be the age, sex, race of the thing
you're writing about. You have to be a talented writer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Writers Guild report, by William T. and Denise B. Bielby,
professors of sociology at the University of California at Santa
Barbara, found that about 70 percent of writers under 30 worked in
1997, compared to less than 33 percent of writers over 50. In only
a handful of series were at least a third of the writers over the
age of 50. Surprisingly, some of those series were youth-oriented,
including ``Baywatch Nights,'' ``Walker, Texas Ranger'' and ``The
Magnificent Seven.''
</P>
<P>
   But these are exceptions. ``I began in the 50s _ when older,
more experienced writers got the jobs and younger people had
trouble finding work,'' said Irma Kalish, a television writer and
executive producer on such shows as ``The Facts of Life.'' She
added, ``The pendulum has swung entirely the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   Another writer, Hindi Brooks, who wrote for such shows as
``Fame'' and ``Eight Is Enough,'' put it another way. Ms. Brooks
(``I'm above 50'') had grown somewhat successful and had moved from
a small talent agency that represented her to the big William
Morris Agency. But after a while, she couldn't find work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The agent said he couldn't sell me, and I asked him why,'' she
recalled. ``He said, `Your hair is turning gray.' ''

CHALLENGERS TO INCUMBENTS ARE FIGHTING UPHILL BATTLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Calif, N.C., Ohio, Mich., N.Y.)  (jw) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there ever was an underdog, it is Lawrence
Klemens, a Democratic high school principal in western Pennsylvania
seeking the congressional seat of Republican incumbent Rep. Phil
English.
</P>
<P>
   Where English will spend $950,000, Klemens has a budget of at
best $15,000. English has a full-time campaign staff, a file with
7,000 donors, and $300,000 in television advertisements swamping
the Erie airwaves. Klemens operates on a shoestring. Because he
works full time, his campaigning starts at 4 p.m. He asks donors
for sticks to attach to campaign signs, and his advertising costs
nothing: It's talking.
</P>
<P>
   Klemens has virtually no chance of winning. He has received no
help from cash-strapped national party committees that are giving
money only to potential winners. He has been shunned by corporate
donors who want sure bets in Washington. Klemens is in a bind:
Without money, he cannot wage a winning campaign; unless he is seen
as a winner, he cannot get money.
</P>
<P>
   This year's House races, more than any in recent memory, are
populated with challengers like Lawrence Klemens, woefully outspent
and far behind. The fund-raising gap between incumbents and
challengers has grown to almost ridiculous proportions. Of the 435
House races, 260 incumbents, or nearly 60 percent, have 10 to 1
advantages in money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more and more impossible to defeat an incumbent
in the U.S. House because there is no money out there for
challengers,'' said Larry Makinson of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonprofit group that collects campaign financing data.
``Challengers have to be knocking on the doors until their arms are
falling off. In every state you can think of, the deck is stacked
in favor of the incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   In 99 races, for instance, House challengers have raised so
little money they have not even met the $5,000 threshold requiring
them to file with the Federal Election Commission. In about 100
districts, incumbents are unopposed. But that has not stopped them
from raising, on average, $400,000 per incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, of the $250 million raised by all House candidates in
this election cycle, around three-quarters, or $186 million, was
raised by incumbents, according to the Campaign Study Group, a
campaign finance research firm in Springfield, Va.
</P>
<P>
   More incumbents are seeking re-election than in any recent year.
Many veterans either retired or were defeated in the 1994 or 1996
elections. That has left fewer open seats, those considered to be
the most competitive. And with only about 40 House members facing
any serious opposition, most incumbents are expected to glide to
victory. Because everyone wants to back a winner, the bulk of
campaign donations is flowing to incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided races span the country. In California, Democratic
Rep. Barbara Lee, who represents the Oakland-Berkeley district, has
raised more than $400,000; her Republican challenger, Claiborne
Sanders, about $10,000. In North Carolina, Rep. Sue Myrick, a
Charlotte Republican, has raised $475,000; her Democratic
challenger, Rory Blake, $15,000. And in Ohio, Democratic incumbent
Sherrod Brown of the Cleveland suburbs has $786,000; his Republican
challenger, Grace Drake, $56,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't buy the seat, I can't buy people's attention,'' said
Susan Grimes Munsell, a Republican, campaigning in Michigan's 8th
District with $44,000, compared with the $758,000 of the Democratic
incumbent, Debbie Stabenow. ``I have to earn votes one at a time,''
Ms. Munsell said. ``My opponent has a staff doing her scheduling
and driving for her. These are advantages money can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is a hotbed of lopsided races, especially ones with
unopposed incumbents with six-digit treasuries. This includes 11 of
New York's 18 House Democratic incumbents and four of the 13
Republicans. Among the Democrats are Gary Ackerman ($581,000
raised), Edolphus Towns ($592,500), Jerrold Nadler ($421,200),
Nydia Velazquez ($329,400) and Charles Rangel ($996,500).
Republicans include Sherwood Boehlert ($440,000), Rick Lazio ($1.3
million) and Peter King ($378,000).
</P>
<P>
   In western Pennsylvania, the English-Klemens race demonstrates
how a financial mismatch can affect a campaign. Klemens has never
run for office and is seeking to become a ``citizen legislator,''
he said, while English honed his campaign skills beating a strong
Democratic opponent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big advantages is that Phil English has been
through this before and we are on track to raise a lot of money,''
said Robert Holste, English's chief of staff. ``As an incumbent,
you've built a large file of people who will donate. You've got
systems in place. A campaign is like a small business with a
payroll, computers and a Web page. Having those gives us an
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite is true for Klemens. ``If you don't have money, you
don't get money,'' said Klemens, who is using a vacation week from
school to campaign. ``It's not only the national party committee,
but from all standpoints. Money begets money and it's difficult to
break that chain. That's how the game is played. The first question
people ask me these days is not about my views, but how much money
I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents have always had advantages: name recognition, power
of the office, the aura of being a winner, a track record to run on
and all the perks of pork-barrel politics.
</P>
<P>
   But all that is heightened in this year's unusually
uncompetitive House contests. For starters, there are only 33 of
the so-called open seats _ where candidates run on relatively equal
footing. There were 51 in 1996, 52 in 1994 and 84 in 1992. In races
involving an incumbent, only about 40 challengers are considered to
have a real chance.
</P>
<P>
   While the competition is shrinking, however, corporate political
donations have been steadily growing. One truism about business
money is that it is pragmatic and not political. Corporate money
goes to buy access in Washington and corporations want to back
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fewer House elections with any real action this
year,'' said Thomas Mann, a congressional expert at the Brookings
Institution. ``The parties have written off more seats and haven't
helped the challengers who are the real long shots. Business
political action committees play it safe. They go with the
incumbents because they want to maintain access.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Political action committees give overwhelmingly to incumbents.
In this election cycle, they have raised $149 million for House and
Senate races, and have given 84 percent, or $125 million, to
incumbents, the Center for Responsible Politics said. In 1996, 65
percent of PAC money went to incumbents; in 1994, 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we don't have a Democratic or a Republican Party, we
have an incumbency party,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of
Democracy 21, a nonprofit group lobbying for campaign finance
reform. ``If you are an incumbent, whether a Democrat or a
Republican, you will get the bulk of the money in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the political parties themselves, which make direct
donations to individual House candidates, are cutting back in
supporting long-shot challengers. This is especially true of the
Democrats, whose congressional campaign committee has raised $13.2
million so far to help House candidates. The Republican counterpart
has raised $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling challengers that to beat an incumbent you have
to be very well-funded,'' said Daniel Sallick, a spokesman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``Fund-raising success
feeds fund-raising success. Strong challengers attract money when
there's a sense they have a real shot at winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Another high Democratic Party fund-raising official added: ``We
don't want to give money to tilt at windmills or buy landslides.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, more flush with cash, are giving lavishly to their
House candidates. The Republican Congressional Committee is
providing 90 House candidates with up to $70,000 in direct
donations and is sponsoring a $25 million television advertising
blitz for House candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Republicans are the incumbent party. And, according
to Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, ``We want to take maximum advantage of the
current situation.''

   BETHESDA, Md. _ The National Institutes of Health used to feel
like a bucolic college campus. Now it is a giant construction
project, with cranes and bulldozers erecting new laboratories, a
new research hospital and a new center for vaccine research.
</P>
<P>
   The activity here is the tangible symbol of a huge new federal
investment in biomedical research. Congress is providing far more
money than President Clinton requested because congressional
leaders of both parties have vowed to double the agency's budget
over five years _ a process that began with the 1999 appropriations
bill, which just became law.
</P>
<P>
   The institutes have always enjoyed respect on Capitol Hill. But
lawmakers said they had increased the agency's budget more than
usual because they believed that researchers were on the threshold
of a new era. Discoveries in many fields _ especially genetics,
neuroscience and cell biology _ promise to save lives and transform
the practice of medicine in the next decade, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress provided $15.6 billion for the 1999 fiscal year, which
began on Oct. 1, up from $13.6 billion in the prior year _ an
increase of $2 billion, or 15 percent. That rate of increase,
sustained and compounded over five years, would double the
institutes' budget by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The 322-acre campus of the institutes is a beehive of activity
as construction crews reroute traffic, tear down trees, build new
roads and excavate a maze of underground tunnels to deliver steam,
water and electricity to the buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But scientists here receive just 10 percent of the agency's
budget. The rest is distributed to universities, medical schools,
teaching hospitals and private nonprofit research institutes. Most
of the money goes for basic research, to investigate fundamental
properties of genes and cells, or to test new methods of treating
diseases and disabling conditions. Among the priorities recommended
by Congress are mapping the human genome, preventing Alzheimer's
disease and finding better ways to detect ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also provided $30 million this year for renovation and
construction of biomedical research laboratories around the
country. Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, the ranking Democrat on the
appropriations subcommittee responsible for the National Institutes
of Health, said he would seek much bigger increases for such
construction spending in the next couple of years. He is likely to
find allies among Republicans, including Sen. Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, chairman of that subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $2 billion increase for NIH is simply breathtaking,'' said
Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human services. ``It's
extraordinary, the single largest dollar increase in NIH history.''
</P>
<P>
   In his budget request in February, Clinton sought a more modest
increase, $1.14 billion, or 8.4 percent, which would have been
financed through an increase in tobacco taxes. But Congress never
approved the tobacco proposals.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional aide who works on the institutes' budget said
the big increase this year resulted mainly from lobbying by public
health groups and advocates concerned about specific diseases like
breast cancer, AIDS, diabetes and Alzheimer's. These groups work
closely with scientists and medical schools in lobbying Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``NIH stood on the sidelines,'' said the congressional aide, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``NIH didn't lobby hard for
this.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Dr. Harold Varmus, director of the
National Institutes of Health, said: ``I'm a team player. We are
part of the administration, and we supported the president's budget
request. We don't have to advocate. We have advocates, very strong
advocates, in the disease groups and professional organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the institutes' budget grew an average of
7 percent a year, and with that money the agency was able to
prepare for the construction now under way.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is directly responsible for one project, the five-story
vaccine research center, being built at a cost of $29 million. In a
speech at Morgan State University in Baltimore in May 1997, Clinton
declared a national goal of developing an AIDS vaccine within 10
years. Much of the work to achieve that goal will take place at the
center. Researchers there will also work on vaccines for other
diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Varmus, who won a Nobel Prize in 1989 for his research on
cancer-causing genes, said he was pleased that Congress had
generally resisted the temptation to earmark money for specific
research projects at specific universities.
</P>
<P>
   The windfall comes just as the agency is trying to give patients
and ordinary citizens a bigger voice in setting research
priorities. The National Academy of Sciences gently chided the
agency this summer, saying it had not sought enough public comment
on these important decisions. Varmus said he was searching for ways
to ``enhance public participation in NIH activities,'' as the
academy recommended.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress did not dictate precisely how money should be
spent in the new appropriations law, it did offer advice in a
report that accompanied the legislation. Over the years, officials
of the institutes have won the trust of lawmakers by closely
following such recommendations whenever they could.
</P>
<P>
   This year, for example, Congress urged the institutes to support
more research on progressive supranuclear palsy, a disabling
condition similar to Parkinson's disease; Behcet's syndrome, a rare
chronic inflammatory disorder, and brittle bone disease, an
inherited condition that leaves people susceptible to fractures
throughout their lives.

<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee initially earmarked $175
million for prostate cancer research, a cause of great interest to
the committee chairman, Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, who had surgery
for prostate cancer in 1991. House and Senate negotiators dropped
the explicit mandate. But their conference report says, ``NIH is
strongly urged to make prostate cancer a top priority'' and to
``accelerate spending'' on the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also urged the institutes to begin ``a full-scale
initiative'' to find ways of preventing Alzheimer's in people who,
because of their family history or other factors, are likely to
develop the illness.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of some government scientists, Congress this
year upgraded the status and authority of a small unit at the
institutes that studies alternative medicine, including
acupuncture, chiropractic care and homeopathic remedies. It also
urged Varmus to step up research on dietary supplements, including
the possible value of chromium in fighting diabetes, and it said he
should establish several new centers to highlight the benefits of
``mind/body medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans took control of Congress in 1995, they
skeptically scrutinized the institutes' budget and told scientists
to expect substantial cuts, as part of the Republican effort to
balance the federal budget. But Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia
and other Republicans have become strong supporters of the agency,
in part because they see it as an engine of economic growth.
Moreover, they say, research financed by the institutes is
extremely important to plant genetics and promises to increase the
productivity of seeds and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, a trade group, welcomed the big increase in the
agency's budget. He said many biotech companies had licensing
arrangements that allowed them to develop prescription drug
products using scientific discoveries made by the institutes and
its grantees. The companies pay royalties to the government or the
universities where the discoveries were made.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a partnership between government and industry that
really works,'' Feldbaum said. ``It's the envy of many other
nations, to be able to take basic research and turn it into
therapies and cures.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ China's family planning system, notorious for the
harsh rules and punishments it deploys in its quest to limit
births, has quietly started urging its workers to soften their
approach, hoping to improve its often tense relationship with
Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
   In a small but rapidly increasing number of counties, officials
say they have eliminated the onerous system of permits for
pregnancy and quotas stipulating how many children can be born in a
year, giving women far greater choice in deciding when to have a
child and somewhat more leeway in deciding how many children to
have.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate aim is still to control this vast country's
population growth, yielding families with one child in the cities
and generally two in rural areas. But officials say they now hope
to achieve that end not by fiat and coerced abortions, but through
a broader women's-health system that discourages large families
through patient education, contraceptive choice and heavy taxes for
couples who choose to have an additional child.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are expanding our programs and changing our attitudes,''
said Cong Jun, a director general at the State Family Planning
Commission. ``We want to change from an administrative program
focusing on numbers to more of a service-oriented approach.'' Just
last week, the commission issued regulations prohibiting
grass-roots family planning workers from forcing women to undergo
abortions or sterilization, although officials contend such
coercion is rare.
</P>
<P>
   The new-style approach, which was officially first tried as a
furtive experiment in six counties several years ago, has not
affected the vast majority of Chinese women _ most do not know it
exists. But dozens of similar programs have taken root across the
country in the last 18 months, with at least the tacit support of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a big change in approach and these kinds of
changes have been expanding rapidly,'' said Tu Ping, a professor at
Beijing University, who has urged change. This is the first time
this system's leaders have sanctioned relaxing the core controls,
although some women have long skirted regulations by having
unapproved children and some local officials have tolerated it.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a relatively small experiment in a variegated country
of 1.26 billion, and many obstacles remain, from dissent among high
officials to the ingrained habits of local family planning
officials accustomed to strong-arm techniques, to the deep
suspicion of women toward a system whose methods they have long
regarded as brutish and capricious _ even as they have supported
population control, its ultimate aim.
</P>
<P>
   A 29-year-old Communist Party member and hospital administrator
from southern China, who spoke on condition that she be identified
only by her surname, Zhang, said that less than two years ago
family planning officials at her work site stripped her of her job,
stopped her paychecks and held her down for a pelvic exam to check
her fetus' age when they asserted that she had become pregnant
before obtaining her permit to have her one and only child. She
said a shift in approach would be welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that if these policies can be implemented it would be
better for all of us,'' she said. ``It would be a big improvement
for Chinese women.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the Family Planning Program has increasingly
seemed to be an anachronism. High-powered couples who choose jobs
and buy homes and travel the world are thrown back into a Mao-era
time warp when they want to have a child, which in most places
still requires gaining permits from the local government and a
woman's employer before pregnancy occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Women can be turned down if their company or neighborhood has
exceeded its quota of births for the year. And couples who dare to
have a child without permits, or _ worse _ an illegal second child,
can face heavy financial penalties, job loss or, in some cases,
police detention.
</P>
<P>
   In areas with the new family planning programs, there has been
change. In Shanghai and the wealthy seaboard region of northern
Zhejiang Province, women no longer need approval to have their
first child. Some districts in Beijing are experimenting with this
system and Ms. Cong said the whole city would probably adopt the
change.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a number of family-planning clinics are
undergoing makeovers so that dreary offices whose primary function
used to be inserting IUD's and performing tubal ligations or
abortions now are offering an expanded range of services from
wide-ranging contraceptive counseling to support for breast-feeding
mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Also in these zones, officials emphasize that people who are
technically allowed only one child (generally city dwellers and
rural residents with a son) may have a second without fear of
punishment. They simply pay a ``family planning fee'' to cover the
cost of an additional citizen.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Officials here assert that having an extra child has never
really been regarded as a crime and that the payments are not
``fines,'' as they were commonly called in the past. That may be
news to people like Qu, a farmer in rural Hebei Province who spoke
on condition he be identified only by his surname. He said he was
detained for a week by the public-security bureau two years ago
after his son had an unapproved second child. But where the new
system has taken hold, the tenor of family planning has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Lingjun, a well-dressed 29-year-old who had brought her
5-month-old son into the Tianlin subdistrict family planning center
in Shanghai to have a small scrape on his head checked, said: ``I
think I'd really like to have a second, a girl. When the time
comes, if we really want another and we can afford it, we will
pay.''
</P>
<P>
   But Shanghai is the most cosmopolitan city in China, and its
population is shrinking anyway. It is less clear how this policy
will be received in more conservative cities, like Beijing, or in
China's vast rural areas, where larger families are considered
desirable and sons essential, where health workers are not
accustomed to giving women choices and women are not accustomed to
having them.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Heshan village in the midst of Zhejiang's fertile
plains, Yang Lizhen, 35, sat in a whitewashed sitting room adorned
with posters of Hong Kong pop stars and explained how she had an
IUD put in nine years ago after the birth of her daughter. A
factory worker with cropped hair and a broad smile who speaks only
her provincial dialect, she looked puzzled when asked if she had
considered other contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about other methods,'' she said. ``I go to the
family planning center three or four times a year where she checks
my IUD. I have not been informed about other choices.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, only 39 percent of women who underwent tubal ligation
had counseling before surgery, according to the Family Planning
Commission. The vast majority of Chinese women still have an IUD
inserted after the birth of a first child and are sterilized after
the second, although in the cities that is changing.
</P>
<P>
   The modern family-planning clinic in Yuyao City in Zhejiang,
where counselors provide up-to-date advice on sex and
contraceptives, also dispenses a jarring reminder of the system's
authoritarian policies: an advisory to newlyweds that if they have
certain medical conditions _ from schizophrenia to colon polyps to
congenital hearing loss _ they are forbidden to have children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cong of the State Family Planning Commission said that
family-planning workers would have to change their attitude and, to
that end, the commission has been sending officials to courses in
the United States and to Thailand's voluntary family-planning
clinics to ``show them that there are other options for
accomplishing our goals.''
</P>
<P>
   ``China has made a great effort to change to a client centered
program _ and that is a very welcome thing,'' said Dr. Ardash
Misra, an official of Partners in Population and Development, an
organization devoted to promoting voluntary population control in
third-world nations, which accepted China as a member late last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign experts say that China will also have to reshape the
family-planning hierarchy, in which promotion has depended on
enforcing a low birth rate. ``They'll really have to redefine what
is a good family planning cadre,'' said a Western health expert
based in Beijing. ``Otherwise there will be no chance for change.''
</P>
<P>
   The new programs have taken root in various ways. The State
Family Planning Commission is financing official experiments in
more than a dozen locations. Private foundations, like Ford and
Rockefeller, have added money and expertise to the mix. The United
Nations Population Fund has helped the commission put together
similar programs in 32 counties _ an act that has prompted Congress
to withhold financing for the agency, saying it did not want
American money spent in a country that performs so many abortions.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been bottom-up support as well. When a private
group organized a training seminar for workers from official test
counties, officials from dozens of other cities turned up as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reproductive choice'' retains a carefully circumscribed
meaning in China. The general policy is that only certain families
may have more than one child: those who belong to ethnic
minorities, rural families whose first child is a daughter,
families where both parents are themselves only children, and
families in which the first child is handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   Others who want an additional child pay stiff fees. In Shanghai,
the fee is three times the combined annual salary of the parents.
In Zhejiang, it is 20 percent of the parents' combined salaries for
five years. In Qinghai Province, the government has added a carrot
to the stick, offering smaller families special low-interest
business loans.
</P>
<P>
   Planned Parenthood this is not, but Chinese seem alternately
dubious and hopeful about the promise of change, particularly if
the program better monitors its workers. Although officials insist
that abuse is rare, it seems that almost everyone in China knows
someone whose life has been turned into a hellish nightmare by
zealous family planning officials, who sometimes mete out
punishments that far exceed those stipulated in government
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize there existed problems and we have started to
manage them,'' said Li Honggui, commission vice minister.
</P>
<P>
   A move away from a rigid family-planning system based on IUD's
and sterilization was perhaps inevitable in a country where women
now have many choices in their personal lives and can read about
sex, condoms and birth control pills in magazines like Elle.
</P>
<P>
   There has also been a change in the government, where a new
gneration of officials, like Ms. Cong, has studied overseas and is
attuned to issues of patient choice.
</P>
<P>
   But China can now afford to give women more freedom than when
the One Child Policy was adopted in 1980, in the midst of a
population explosion. After two decades of iron-fisted family
planning, the average number of children has dropped, from almost
six to about two per woman of child-bearing age, since 1970. And,
in the new market economy _ where parents must pay rent, child care
and school fees _ it is unlikely that a population explosion will
resume.
</P>
<P>
   Many urban Chinese today only want one child. ``I never thought
for a moment about having a second,'' said Wu Aiqing, 40, on her
lunch break from her factory job, fashionably dressed in a yellow
blouse and long black skirt. ``The state encourages us to have just
one child. But anyway it's too expensive and I want to focus on my
work.''

AS KING HUSSEIN AILS, HIS BROTHER WAITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALAN COWELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan _ When King Hussein of Jordan appeared at the
White House to place his personal seal on the Palestinian-Israeli
agreement the week before last, it was a moment of pathos and pride
for many of his distant people: His presence magnified his prestige
as a peacemaker; his appearance, made spectral by chemotherapy,
drove home to many for the first time how severely cancer has
stricken him.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, the king's illness has inspired those around him _
from his brother, Crown Prince Hassan, to the loyalists who make up
the government _ to concentrate their efforts on one task:
promoting the idea that transition, when it does come to this
strategically placed land, will be as seamless as the king intended
since anointing his younger brother as his successor more than
three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a rare interview, his Royal Highness Hassan bin
Talal, heir to the Hashemite throne and 42nd-generation descendant
of Mohammed, seemed at pains to say that no one could accuse him of
being unprepared after 33 years as his brother's closest confidant,
understudy and frequent stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be fair if people were to make a study of
three decades of public life, where we have complemented each other
in rather a remarkable manner,'' he said in the interview, which
took place at the royal palace. He used the occasion to speak of
his close relationship with his brother, of his aspirations for
regional peace and of his irritation with those who criticize his
manner as overly erudite and intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the king's absence,'' said Radwan Abdallah, a political
scientist at Amman University, ``the stress is on assuring
everybody that succession _ if it comes to succession _ will be a
smooth process.''
</P>
<P>
   Never before has the 51-year-old crown prince acted as the
king's replacement for as long as he has this time. Three and a
half months ago, the king went to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn., to begin chemotherapy for lymphoma _ his second brush with
cancer in five years. Since then the crown prince has been working
the trans-Atlantic phones talking with his brother, and pursuing
his contacts with compatriots, in an obvious effort to show his
mettle as a ruler.
</P>
<P>
   The stability of this small country has direct consequences for
all of its neighbors, from Israel to Iraq. And then there are the
U.S. policy-makers who called the king to the negotiations at the
Wye Plantation in Maryland the week before last in the final
fraught days before the Palestinian-Israeli agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And so among the king's loyalists _ and some diplomats _ there
is a clear desire to promote the notion that with the outcome of
the king's medical treatment far from clear, the crown prince has
already passed some kind of unstated initial test.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are talking about the crown prince today,'' said
Nasser Judeh, the information minister, who is also the crown
prince's son-in-law, ``you are talking about a serious junior
partner to the king who has been around, trained for the job, for
33 years. Will Jordan survive? Will Jordan weather this storm? They
said that in 1921, when the emirate was formed. Seventy-seven years
later we are still around.''
</P>
<P>
   And, said a knowledgeable Western official, ``not to
underestimate the enormous challenges, the crown prince has
demonstrated that he's well grounded, he's capable of working with
the key players and governing effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   But how does the crown prince feel about those who say he lacks
the king's stature and charisma, is less qualified to exert his
writ over a land known more for the perils of war and peace than
for easy management?
</P>
<P>
   How does he feel about those who see him as simply an erudite
adjunct to the king, more at ease with highbrow economic manuals
than the Bedouin tribes and restive Palestinian majority that mark
his land of 4 million?
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you define profile?'' he mused. ``We are two different
people, and that's something that should be understood in the best
possible sense. We believe in respecting each other's views.'' It
is true, he said, that the king _ who has ruled for 45 years _ is
``the symbol to the people,'' while the crown prince has been
``closer to the kitchen'' of everyday business.
</P>
<P>
   But, he went on, ``I don't know why people refer to me as rather
more cerebral, intellectual. If being cerebral means I have
contracted some kind of malady that makes me unfit for shouldering
public responsibility,'' he concluded, ``all I can say is ...,''
and then he uttered a profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was calculated to show an earthiness not usually
associated with him. But it was delivered with the kind of plummy
heartiness that makes the crown prince _ whether in his dark
business suit or on his polo pony _ seem more a product of his
aristocratic British upbringing at Harrow School and Oxford
University than the treacherous shoals of regional politics charted
by his elder brother.
</P>
<P>
   Conversations with Jordanians, Palestinians and diplomats of
other nations reveal the crown prince as a more modest, less
flamboyant figure than the king, a family man with a lower
tolerance for corruption than his brother. ``Transparency and
accountability in the longer term are essential,'' he said in the
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Despite much talk of palace intrigue between princes from the
king's and the crown prince's lines of succession, the king has not
publicly wavered in his commitment to his brother as his heir and
thus as the future custodian of the Hashemite line, which dates
back to 1201.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   Emblems of a more modern claim on legitimacy, the banners of
both the Jordanian state and the 1916 Arab revolt against the
Ottomans, which was led by his great-grandfather, flank the crown
prince's desk.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the key to Jordan's stability lies in the way the
Hashemite dynasty balances not just regional pressures but also
domestic strains. In Jordanian society _ where power has always
rested on a latticework of connections to tribes and powerful
families _ Palestinians outnumber Jordanians by more than two to
one, and many Palestinians say they mistrust the crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monarchy is much more than the person of the king,'' said
Abdallah of Amman University. ``It is an institution, and it plays
a vital role in our society. It is the role of moderator, of
conciliator, of arbiter, holder of the balance. The need for this
role is there.''
</P>
<P>
   But here, too, there are differences of style between the king
and his brother. ``The king uses the carrot first, then the
stick,'' said Bassam Saket, head of Jordan's Securities Exchange
Commission and a former economic adviser at the royal court. ``The
crown prince uses the stick, then the carrot. But neither hits very
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond such protestations of benevolence, though, is a powerful
domestic security network largely controlled by loyalist Jordanians
closer to the king than to his brother. Indeed, throughout his
regency, Hassan has been in close touch with the king, who is still
seen as the real power as his land confronts crises on virtually
every front.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1990 Gulf war, Jordan's economy has been in a mess. It
lost its biggest market in Iraq, but secured none of the economic
benefits that Hussein sought with his 1994 peace with Israel. The
peace is unpopular among many Jordanians. And a perilous economic
gap has widened, further isolating a rich coterie of well-connected
families from the grinding poverty of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The vista is no more cheerful along Jordan's frontiers. Syria
and Iraq are both uneasy and potentially meddlesome neighbors,
while the Gulf Arab states that once supported Jordan financially
still have not forgiven the king for siding with Saddam Hussein in
the Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   After the Wye interim agreements, any future Palestinian-Israeli
maneuvers toward a final settlement offer another minefield for

   ``You have to say _ let's go back to the 1930s and say: Have the

   LAGAMBLE _ New Orleans_There's a favorite saying among casino
opponents here: Bring gambling into Louisiana and you'll be
throwing gasoline on a bonfire. Their prediction seems to be coming
true. It has been a busy October at the federal courthouse in Baton
Rouge. Three associates of former Gov. Edwin Edwards have copped
guilty pleas and made deals with the U.S. Attorney's Office, and in
the process have revealed lurid details of payoffs, extortion and
illegal influence at three casinos. Also this month, two members of
the state's revamped gambling board_a supposedly squeaky clean
regulatory agency set up by Gov. Mike Foster_were named in the
federal investigation of Edwards. It is now well known that 13 of
the 15 riverboat casino licenses awarded here went to friends and

   TRIPLE _BUDDIES _ ATLANTA _ Gerrold Shropshire and Ronald
Gutkowski had a friendship that crossed boundaries of race and
religion. Gerrold was black and Ronald was white. Both were in the
trucking business, loved football and loved to cook. They ate
together every day at a grocery store in Okahumpka, Florida, but
they lived in different worlds: Ronald's world was an all-white
retirement community where Sunday brought an occasional trip to a
Catholic Church dominated by elderly Northerners. Gerrold bounced
from apartment to apartment in Orlando, and his life outside work
revolved almost completely around a black Baptist Church where the
pastor is accompanied most mornings by drums and pianos and a choir
that sways and claps and shouts. (Bixler, Atlanta

   PBP-BLOOD-BANK _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Donors give their blood
to the Palm Beach Blood Bank for free. After processing the blood,
the blood bank sells it to hospitals and other medical
institutions, taking in millions of dollars a year. Yet, blood bank
CEO John Flynn and his nine-member board of directors won't allow
the public to see how the money is spent, even though several of
the directors admit they don't examine the expenditures in any
detail. Non-profit organizations don't have to open their books.
But those heavily involved with the public often do when presented
with a legitimate request. Jerry Haarman, treasurer of America's
Blood Centers, a national organization of independent blood
centers, said he believes blood banks have an ethical
responsibility to open their books because they are supposed to be
operating in the public interest and, like other nonprofit
organizations, they don't pay taxes. ``I submit to you that if you
are truly a community blood center then you have an obligation to
the public,'' said Haarman, who is CEO of a Minneapolis-based blood
bank, Memorial Blood Centers of Minnesota. ``All your records
should be open for public inspection.'' (Horine, Palm Beach Post).

   MILMED _ DAYTON, Ohio _ In the year since the Dayton Daily News
series on military medicine, the Department of Defense has
tightened oversight of doctors who practice in the military. But
the changes do not address some of the major findings in the
newspaper series. About 1.7 million active-duty military members
and their dependents overseas cannot collect damages in a lawsuit.
And military doctors still do not have to be licensed in the states
where they practice, nor do they have to carry malpractice
insurance. U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine said he would consider giving
military members the right to sue the government in medical
malpractice cases. ``I don't know how you morally justify making
people in the military second-class citizens: not being able to
file lawsuits other citizens can file,'' DeWine said. ``We should
look to protect those in the military. They are the ones who
protect us.'' (Carollo/Nesmith, Dayton Daily News) MOVED

   HAITI-POLITICS-$ADV01 _ PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti _ Anxiety is
building over Haiti, a ticking time bomb set to explode if a
political stalemate that has paralyzed the government isn't
resolved. The United States has pumped hundreds of millions of
dollars into this country since 1994, and there are still 500 U.S.
troops stationed here. Four years ago, hopes were running high when
President Clinton sent 20,000 troops to Haiti to overthrow a
military regime and restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to
power. But, today, the situation couldn't be more desperate. Courts
are corrupt. Drug trafficking is rampant. Unemployment is at more
than 60 percent. In a poll conducted by the U.S. Embassy,
three-fourths of those surveyed said they would leave Haiti if they
could. Already, many tried to flee to Florida in recent weeks,
driven away by growing poverty. Meanwhile, a 16-month political
squabble has left Aristide's successor, Rene Preval, with little
authority and the country with no functioning government.
Parliamentary elections that were scheduled for November have been
indefinitely postponed. (Emling, Cox News Service).

A month after Hurricane Georges ravaged poverty-stricken Haiti, the
effects of the storm are becoming clear. More than 400 people are
dead. Thousands of homes have been destroyed. More than 56,000 cows
and other animals have been killed. Agricultural damage is
estimated at $300 million, with hundreds of thousands of acres of
crops disappearing under chest-high water. As a result, Haiti has
become more dependent than ever on foreign emergency aid. Relief,
fortunately, has poured in from a myriad of sources, ranging from
Atlanta-based CARE to the city of Surfside in Florida. (Emling, Cox

were young and upwardly mobile Russians enjoying all that the
post-Soviet economy had to offer: new furnishings for their
apartment and country house, vacations abroad and a private tutor
to teach English to their nine-year-old son, Anton. Now, the good
times have vanished. He lost his job as a corporate marketing
director. She believes her layoff as an executive headhunter is
just a matter of time. The brighter future is on hold. Russia's
economic crisis is squeezing out the middle class. While small, the
middle class was the great hope for the staying power of democracy
and reforms _ how you gonna send them back to the Soviet days after
they've seen cable TV and Disney World? (Holmes, Cox News Service).

been called a political killing ground _ and for good reason. Since
the congressional district's boundaries were redrawn in 1991, no
incumbent has managed to win an election. And the race between
incumbent Ted Strickland and challenger Nancy Hollister has
national significance; it's called the best example of a swing
district in the entire country. ``If the Republicans can win there,
they could win in a lot of places. Or put it this way: to pick up a
lot of seats, they have to win in places like the 6th,'' says one
Ohio college professor. (McCall, Dayton Daily News)

   OIL-FUTURE-$ADV01 _ WASHINGTON _ Enjoy today's low gasoline

When demand jumps at the inevitable end of today's worldwide
economic downswing, gasoline prices will start going up again at
the pump. But adjustments made by our government, other
governments, Wall Street and the oil industry should prevent the
kind of supply shock that led to gasoline lines in 1974 and 1979.
If you are forced in the next few years to wait in line at a
service station for gasoline, it is less likely to be caused by a
supply shortage than it is to be caused (No joke!) by Y2K glitches
in the innards of some gasoline pumps. (Mollison, Cox News

PARIS TRANSIT PLANS HALT IN RESPONSE TO VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Yves Sauz, a motorman on the Paris rapid-transit system,
says he likes everything about the job except the increasingly
tough customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't even safe here in the cab,'' he said on a fast
underground train headed to St.-Germain-en-Laye. ``A little while
ago, on a day when there was a tie-up for some reason, a guy tapped
for me to open the side window. `I hope you're happy you've made me
15 minutes late,' he told me, and started punching me in the
chest.'' Sauz shook his head.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, thousands of the 40,000 bus and train drivers, ticket
agents and other employees of the French capital's municipal
transit system plan to strike back, with a work stoppage from 10
a.m. to 2 p.m. to press demands for better security in the face of
rising violence.
</P>
<P>
   Crime on public transport generated scores of smaller transit
strikes all over the country last month, with employees refusing to
work unless transit authorities hire more personnel to deal with
troublesome passengers, particularly youths, who are implicated in
about a quarter of all such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There once was a time when young people behaved themselves,
but society's changed,'' said Pierre Sauvanet, a representative of
Force Ouvriere, or Workers' Force, Sauz's union. ``That's no reason
to expect us to bear the entire burden of dealing with violence,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may not consider France a country much plagued by
urban crime. By the standards of New York City, where the crime
rate has fallen dramatically in recent years, Paris still seems
pretty safe. Jean-Pierre Vigouroux, a colleague of Sauvanet, says
there is an average of one attack a day against employees of the
Paris transit system, which unlike New York's shuts down from about
1:30 a.m. to 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   But there remains a perception of social breakdown, especially
in a country with chronic unemployment. The rate is stuck at 11.7
percent nationwide, but it is much higher in outlying sections of
French cities with large concentrations of alienated youths,
particularly from North African immigrant families.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of a thousand Parisians by the IFOP organization last
spring found that only 47 percent felt safe on the RER, Paris'
suburban commuter network, compared with 62 percent who felt secure
in the Paris subway system. Crime was rated the city's
third-most-urgent problem, behind homelessness but ahead of drug
dealing and illegal immigration.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And vandalism, graffiti and violence are not limited to Paris.
Bus drivers in the southern part of the Mediterranean port city of
Marseilles struck briefly Friday after a passenger attacked one of
them for refusing to make an unscheduled stop. Even in Chambery, a
placid place in the foothills of the Alps, bus service was
interrupted in mid-October after an attack on a driver.
</P>
<P>
   So Monday's Paris protest will have national overtones. What
sparked it was an incident a week ago in a commuter tunnel near the
western Defense station, when a passenger became enraged to learn
that his train was reversing direction.
</P>
<P>
   The motorman walked through the car on his way to the cab at the
other end of the train, officials said later, and the passenger
smashed a fire extinguisher into the door window as the driver
passed through it.
</P>
<P>
   The motorman suffered superficial cuts and was excused from work
for a few days. But fellow drivers refused to work the next day,
crippling service on the train's A line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you leave the cab at one end,'' Sauz said, ``there's no
way to call for help or sound a safety alarm until you get to the
other end of the train. There ought to be that much protection, at
least.''
</P>
<P>
   Police patrols in the Paris rapid-transit tunnels were stepped
up in 1995 after a series of terrorist bombings, and for a while
juvenile delinquency decreased as anti-riot specialists and Foreign
Legionnaires prowled the platforms.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past year, petty crime in the capital rose by nearly
4.5 percent, and police union officials attributed the increase to
the budget, which cut the size of the force by about 1,000
officers.
</P>
<P>
   So, too, with the transit workers, some of whom plan to march on
the Finance Ministry on Monday to demand more protection and more
money. Understaffing and lack of security are two sides of the same
coin, union officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't have to be our own police force, but we often
are,'' said Jean-Noel Jacquet, another motorman, who has found that
good psychology sometimes works best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told a guy in the car behind me to stop smoking,'' Jacquet
said, ``and he waited until we came to the last stop and then came
up and threatened me. I told him that if hadn't said anything to
him, other passengers would have complained to my bosses and I
would have been in trouble. `Really? Those no-good sons of guns!'
the guy said, and left me alone.''

PRIVATE AID GROUPS PRESS U.N. TO HELP END SUDAN'S CIVIL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Private aid groups, currently sending millions
of dollars worth of food and medicine to relieve starvation and
suffering in Sudan, are pressing the United Nations to make a
vigorous new effort to end the nearly 30-year civil war there
instead of merely feeding its victims.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, top officials from Oxfam, Save the Children Fund,
CARE International and Doctors Without Borders pressed their case
for a new U.N. peace effort at a meeting with the 15 members of the
U.N. Security Council. The encounter was only the second time the
panel had agreed to meet with private aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are saying is that this is unacceptable,'' David R.W.
Bryer, director of Oxfam United Kingdom and Ireland, said in an
interview. ``The war has been going on since the 1960s. Political
action is needed and that is why we are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, several agencies said they believed that the Security
Council, which has shown little interest in the Sudanese crisis in
the past, would now become more active. ``We have a commitment the
Security Council will take up Sudan,'' said Guy Tousignant,
secretary-general of CARE International.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America, said, ``We all
feel very strongly that the council is now ready to move on
Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the day after the meeting, the United Nations
announced that Kieran Prendergast, undersecretary-general for
political affairs, will visit Sudan and other countries in the
region next month in an effort to revive peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, diplomats were cautious. ``There were no conclusions,''
said Sweden's deputy permanent representative, Per Norstrom,
chairman of the meeting. ``It's more that perhaps some seeds were
sown.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam's representatives also met with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan. And the aid groups spent much of the week lobbying
other senior U.N. officials as well as the representatives of the
countries scheduled to join the Security Council next year as
rotating members.
</P>
<P>
   In their presentation to the Security Council, the four aid
groups said that Operation Lifeline Sudan, the ambitious relief
effort they and more than 30 other similar groups started more than
a decade ago, has now been reduced to an expensive airlift because
continued fighting has cut the road, rail and river supply routes
they originally planned to use.
</P>
<P>
   These groups now want the United Nations to persuade the
Sudanese government and the rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army to extend a temporary cease-fire agreed to in the province of
Bahr el-Ghazal to all of southern Sudan and maintain it throughout
next year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unless that happens, they warn that both sides may just withdraw
their forces from the province and step up fighting in other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not hopeful, warning that the government and the
rebels have ``settled into a brutal routine of accepting limited
cease-fires which `buy time' for both sides.'' Peace efforts
organized by a regional organization called the Inter-government
Authority on Development ``achieve little for the fundamental
reason that both the government and the SPLA act as though their
interests are better served by war than peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of the organizations are willing to suspend relief
operations, although critics have argued that the outside aid may
be helping to prolong the war. ``This is not an option; far too
many people would die,'' said Tousignant of CARE International.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Locally heavy rain and some strong thunderstorms will plague
parts of the southern Plains and Texas as a potent, slow-moving
jet-stream disturbance drifts east from New Mexico. The heaviest
rain is expected over portions of northern Oklahoma and southern
Kansas, where mild moist air is forced to rise over cooler air in
place across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clouds and patchy light rain will streak into the central
Mississippi and western Ohio River valleys. Farther south, a broken
band of strong thunderstorms may spawn a few tornadoes in the
warmer and more humid air over central and eastern Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Cool, moist air will continue to circulate around a sprawling
low-pressure area south of Nova Scotia, resulting in clouds and a
few showers from northern New England to the Adirondacks. Gusty
breezes from the northwest will add to the chill of the day.
Elsewhere in the Northeast, there will be a mixture of sunshine and
a few clouds. Temperatures will be a few degrees below the seasonal
average.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the interior Southeast and Carolinas will be dry but a
bit cooler than in recent days. Sunshine will be plentiful over
most of the region, but some low clouds will linger near the
western slopes of the southern Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   Unsettled weather will linger over the northwestern states in
the wake of a weakening cold front. Onshore winds will promote
clouds and showers as well as some snow in the Cascades and
northern Bitterroots. Meanwhile, ample sunshine will prevail over
most of California and the deserts of the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Autumn Twisters
</P>
<P>
   Tranquillity is often the hallmark of autumn weather. While the
upper atmosphere lingers in summer warmth, autumn's chill gathers
at the ground as daylight steadily wanes. When cool air underlies
warm, the fast-rising currents that sustain severe thunderstorms
are fleeting. On Friday, the spiraling winds of a vigorous jet
stream offset autumn's stable atmosphere, spawning several
tornadoes in eastern New Mexico and western Texas. The jet stream's
swirling energy will still be evident Sunday, and the unusual roar
of a few autumn twisters may echo across central and eastern Texas.

MILOSEVIC MOVES TO STIFLE DISSENT IN ACADEMIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Vladimir Vodinelic has been teaching law
at Belgrade University for 27 years, and his own experience,
reinforced by reading the history books, tells him that times have
never been so bad in Yugoslav academia.
</P>
<P>
   Four months ago, Vodinelic, a specialist in civil law and the
author of many texts and articles, was dismissed. In an official
document, new officials of the law school said they would not
``dare'' to reappoint Vodinelic in the annual and, until recently,
largely pro forma procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Vodinelic, 50, who calls himself ``opposition minded,'' is more
blunt. ``The real reason is the revival of the old Communist
category of the politically correct person,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, as President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia
was allowing his troops to storm through the towns and villages of
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, he was also conducting a quieter
operation at Serbia's universities to still the voices of teachers
he considered troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   At Belgrade University, Milosevic used his coalition partner,
the far-right Vojislav Seselj of the Radical Party, and officials
of his wife's far-left political party, known as the Yugoslav Left,
to clean out those deemed unfaithful to the government. This
left-to-right coalition _ what critics call Serbia's ``pluralistic
totalitarianism'' _ has not been created for ideological reasons
but more on the basis of personal loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   And loyalty to that triumvirate of political parties is now the
ticket to academic promotion, say professors at Belgrade University
who are sympathetic to the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Four law school professors were dismissed, 25 professors in the
philology department were forbidden to teach and two professors in
the mathematics department were banned from the classroom. The
purges, and reorganizations of most departments according to
political loyalties, were carried out by new deans and rectors
appointed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   Under a new law on universities, one of the most cherished
notions of academic freedom was abolished: Professors no longer
have any say in the choice of their deans. Instead, deans are
chosen by the government.
</P>
<P>
   The new dean of the philology department, for example, is
Radmilo Marojevic, a professor of Russian morphology and a member
of the Radical Party. One of Marojevic's first decisions in his new
post was to make Russian a compulsory subject for all postgraduate
philology students, no matter what their specialty.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of the boldest moves against the university, which
since before World War I has more or less held its own against
government intrusiveness, Seselj was made a member of the executive
board of the law school. The executive board holds critical powers
on how money is spent within the school.
</P>
<P>
   As well as leading the clampdown on the university, Seselj was
the main force in closing down independent newspapers and radio
stations. On Oct. 21, the government said that the closed
newspapers could reopen but that they were subject to a new media
law that gives broad powers to the government to shut them down
again.
</P>
<P>
   The new law bans broadcasts of Serbian language programs by
foreign media, including the Voice of America, the BBC and Radio
Free Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's campaign at Belgrade University _ people here refer
to it as ``pacification'' _ is part of a concerted effort to snuff
out one of the last cells of criticism of the government.
</P>
<P>
   The university has been as important as the independent media,
perhaps more so, in showing resistance to Milosevic. The campus was
the incubator of the 88-day street demonstrations against Milosevic
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The academics say they are particularly despondent because
Milosevic seems to believe that after giving concessions to
Washington on military and political matters in the Serbian
province of Kosovo, he has a free hand to do what he wants
elsewhere. Thus, the academics say, Milosevic is extinguishing the
last possibilities for his opponents to hang on to any democratic
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international community can press Milosevic to do some
things in Kosovo and sooner or later he will do them,'' said Milo
Arsenijevic, a professor in the philosophy department. ``But
without pressing him to democratize _ this is a mistake. It
encourages him to feel that he's a good boy, and he interprets it
to mean that he can do what he likes in Serbia with no consequences
to himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Vodinelic said he learned of the real reasons for his dismissal
from the law school from an interview that the new dean, Oliver
Antic, recently gave to a Serbian newspaper. ``He said, `I will
bring order to the law faculty, which is a breeding ground of the
Civic Alliance,''' Vodinelic recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Civic Alliance is one of three opposition parties that led
the street demonstrations. Vodinelic said he is not a member of the
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The dean told other law school professors, Vodinelic said, that
there was a ``very thick file in the secret service on me.''
Vodinelic, who is a Croat, said he also suspected that he was
dismissed because of his nationality. ``Without being asked about
my nationality, the dean said, `I did not sack him because he is a
Croat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Vodinelic said he was suing the university for illegal
dismissal. He is arguing in court, he said, that he meets all the
academic requirements for reappointment and that his dismissal was
a discriminatory act that violated his constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   In many campuses around the world, students would quickly
organize protests against the stifling of academic freedom. But in
Serbia there are two reasons why they have remained silent.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to blunt demonstrations, an extra round of exams
was introduced at the time that the purges were taking place. And
Seselj announced that students who did not attend class would be
expelled from the university.
</P>
<P>
   As for support from international colleagues, Vodinelic said
several American professors had spoken out. German and French
university authorities have also expressed solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, he said, the support from abroad has brought no
practical results. Vodinelic is now without his monthly $600
salary. Even so, he said, the ``moral value'' has been vital.

U.S. LAWYER: A CHAMPION OF VICTIMS IN RWANDA
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y., Mass.)  (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania _ It was the gruesome pictures of bodies and
bones that caused Pierre-Richard Prosper to give up a comfortable
lawyer's life in Los Angeles for the rigors of Rwanda, a
war-ravaged country with unreliable electricity and water. Prosper,
a New York-bred lawyer, said he wanted to ``make a difference,''
and he did.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations court established for the victims of the
mass killings in Rwanda in 1994, Prosper, 35, became the first
prosecutor to get a verdict of genocide in an international
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   After a 14-month courtroom battle, he secured the conviction of
Jean-Paul Akayesu, who was mayor of the Rwandan village of Taba
when 2,000 people of the Tutsi minority were killed there.
</P>
<P>
   Prosper also succeeded in persuading the judges to include rape
among the crimes that constitute genocide. This is the first time
rape has been recognized as an instrument of genocide in
international law, and the Rwandan former mayor was held
responsible for the rapes committed by militia members under his
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Prosper's odyssey began in 1994 in Los Angeles, where he worked
in the district attorney's office. A colleague who had just come
back from a State Department mission to Rwanda showed slides of
corpses rotting in mass graves, victims of mass killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was moved,'' Prosper remembered.
</P>
<P>
   The colleague, who had a wife and children, did not want to move
to Africa to work with the new Rwanda tribunal, but told Prosper
that he would be perfect for the job.
</P>
<P>
   The son of doctors who moved from Haiti to Saratoga County,
N.Y., Prosper studied romance languages at Boston College and got
his law degree at Pepperdine University.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles district attorney's office, he was promoted
to the special unit prosecuting gang members in South Central and
East Los Angeles, two of the city's toughest neighborhoods. ``I
remember one day having 22 cases on my desk, all homicides and
double homicides,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, was reluctant to move to Africa, but he first went on a
six-week mission to study Rwanda's criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   What he found was a country in crisis, with more than 10 percent
of the population's having been killed and 30,000 suspects awaiting
trial in overcrowded jails. ``I realized it was a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to make a difference in the world,''
he said, explaining why he finally decided to put aside his doubts
and move there.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen ``ruthlessness on the streets of America,'' as
Prosper put it, helped prepare him for what he encountered in
Rwanda. Except for the rape.
</P>
<P>
   During the three months of killing in Rwanda in the spring of
1994, thousands of women and girls were publicly gang-raped, often
before being killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a particularly cruel way of carrying out a genocide _
destroying the group by devaluing them in the eyes of the
community,'' said James Stewart, a senior trial attorney with the
Rwanda tribunal. ``Pierre felt very strongly that this kind of
systematic rape was part of genocide. You can't overstate his
contribution in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the women who survived the ordeal were terrified of
traveling from their rural villages to neighboring Tanzania, where
the tribunal is located, and on top of that could not bear to tell
strangers in public how they had been violated.
</P>
<P>
   But Prosper, who speaks French, a major language in Rwanda,
slowly won their confidence. When members of the prosecution team
suggested appointing a woman attorney to question witnesses about
the rapes, the victims refused and insisted that Prosper handle
their testimony in court.
</P>
<P>
   The Rwanda tribunal has met criticism for disorganization and
slowness, and Prosper has worked hard to convince skeptical
Rwandans that it can deliver justice. After the Akayesu case was
over, he traveled to Taba to tell villagers about the guilty
verdict against their former mayor.
</P>
<P>
   When the tribunal sentenced Akayesu to life in prison, Prosper
began packing his bags for Washington, where he says he hopes to
find a job that will allow him to continue promoting the rule of
law in other countries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At his send-off here last month, colleagues spoke movingly about
what Prosper had already accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who are still alive, or at least not completely
dead, we thank you,'' a Rwandan man who worked as an interpreter at
the tribunal said.
</P>
<P>
   One woman brought a message from the people of Taba: ``Even if
you go, we will say that you have never left us.''

ASIAN BEETLE IS IMPERILING CHICAGO TREES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ A small, black, tree-killing beetle, first detected in
New York more than two years ago, has found its way to Chicago,
where agriculture officials say it has infested hundreds of trees.
This is only its second known infestation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The bug, the Asian long-horned beetle, or Anoplophora
glabripennis, was first discovered here in July by a resident of
the Ravenswood neighborhood on the north side of the city. Since
confirming the identity of the beetle, officials from the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, the Illinois Department of Agriculture
and the city's Forestry Department have found close to 300 infested
trees, all of which are to be destroyed this winter.
</P>
<P>
   A quarantine area of more than 15 square miles has been set up,
and officials like Joe McCarthy, a city forester now devoted full
time to the beetle watch, are going after the little black bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``This particular beetle can be devastating to an urban
environment,'' McCarthy said. ``And if it's not eradicated, there
is a potential threat to the national forest system.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities believe the beetles are imported in raw wooden
packing material from China. As a result, Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman has required that all material imported from China be
treated before being shipped to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The rule, which will take effect on Dec. 17, has created some
tension with Chinese trade officials who do not believe that the
beetle's emergence has been positively linked to their country. But
McCarthy said the authorities had found the local source _ a
hardware manufacturing company in Ravenswood that imports heavy
material in wooden crates from China.
</P>
<P>
   This particular beetle, unlike several of its cousins, actually
eats live wood, causing irreparable damage to living trees,
officials said. Its life cycle, moreover, is such that pesticides
are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   The only way to fight the beetle, experts say, is to cut down
the tree in the winter before adult beetles emerge, and burn the
wood.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said the beetles tended to prefer maple, elm, willow
and chestnut trees, so the city plans to replace those trees
primarily with basswoods and ginkgoes, which the beetles are known
to stay away from.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said that the process of fighting the beetles was a
long one, and that once destruction of the infested trees was
completed, inspectors would start the process all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping this is about a five-year process,'' he said.
Chicago officials feel they caught the problem relatively early; in
New York the beetle is believed to have had three to four years to
spread before it was first detected in Brooklyn. Since the
discovery of the beetle in August 1996, more than 2,400 trees have
been destroyed, said Joe Gittleman, the project manager in New
York.

PRIVATE AID GROUPS PRESS U.N. TO HELP END SUDAN'S CIVIL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subbing to fix time element in 6th graf to November. No other
change.)  (js) 
 By PAUL LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Private aid groups, currently sending millions
of dollars worth of food and medicine to relieve starvation and
suffering in Sudan, are pressing the United Nations to make a
vigorous new effort to end the nearly 30-year civil war there
instead of merely feeding its victims.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, top officials from Oxfam, Save the Children Fund,
CARE International and Doctors Without Borders pressed their case
for a new U.N. peace effort at a meeting with the 15 members of the
U.N. Security Council. The encounter was only the second time the
panel had agreed to meet with private aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are saying is that this is unacceptable,'' David R.W.
Bryer, director of Oxfam United Kingdom and Ireland, said in an
interview. ``The war has been going on since the 1960s. Political
action is needed and that is why we are here.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, several agencies said they believed that the Security
Council, which has shown little interest in the Sudanese crisis in
the past, would now become more active. ``We have a commitment the
Security Council will take up Sudan,'' said Guy Tousignant,
secretary-general of CARE International.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Offenheiser, president of Oxfam America, said, ``We all
feel very strongly that the council is now ready to move on
Sudan.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, the day after the meeting, the United Nations
announced that Kieran Prendergast, undersecretary-general for
political affairs, will visit Sudan and other countries in the
region in November in an effort to revive peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, diplomats were cautious. ``There were no conclusions,''
said Sweden's deputy permanent representative, Per Norstrom,
chairman of the meeting. ``It's more that perhaps some seeds were
sown.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxfam's representatives also met with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan. And the aid groups spent much of the week lobbying
other senior U.N. officials as well as the representatives of the
countries scheduled to join the Security Council next year as
rotating members.
</P>
<P>
   In their presentation to the Security Council, the four aid
groups said that Operation Lifeline Sudan, the ambitious relief
effort they and more than 30 other similar groups started more than
a decade ago, has now been reduced to an expensive airlift because
continued fighting has cut the road, rail and river supply routes
they originally planned to use.
</P>
<P>
   These groups now want the United Nations to persuade the
Sudanese government and the rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation
Army to extend a temporary cease-fire agreed to in the province of
Bahr el-Ghazal to all of southern Sudan and maintain it throughout
next year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unless that happens, they warn that both sides may just withdraw
their forces from the province and step up fighting in other parts
of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not hopeful, warning that the government and the
rebels have ``settled into a brutal routine of accepting limited
cease-fires which `buy time' for both sides.'' Peace efforts
organized by a regional organization called the Inter-government
Authority on Development ``achieve little for the fundamental
reason that both the government and the SPLA act as though their
interests are better served by war than peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But none of the organizations are willing to suspend relief
operations, although critics have argued that the outside aid may
be helping to prolong the war. ``This is not an option; far too
many people would die,'' said Tousignant of CARE International.

AGE LIMITS SET FOR U.N. PEACEKEEPING PERSONNEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Looking for greater maturity and more
experience in the soldiers it sends into peacekeeping operations,
the United Nations set minimum age limits last week for troops and
police trainers.
</P>
<P>
   In an announcement Thursday, a spokesman for Secretary-General
Kofi Annan said that countries contributing to U.N. operations
should not send any civilian police officers or military observers
under age 25. Troops should preferably be over 21, but never
younger than 18.
</P>
<P>
   Undersecretary-General Bernard Miyet, who directs the U.N.
peacekeeping department, said in an interview Friday that the best
way to counter criticism about the conduct of some U.N.
peacekeepers _ for example, in Rwanda or Cambodia in recent years _
is to demand ``experienced, mature and well trained'' people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion of age is something which for us is not a full
guarantee but a better guarantee of this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is especially true for the civilian policemen and for the
military observers because they are most of the time in direct
contact with the population,'' said Miyet, who is French. ``They
are training or monitoring the police or local forces and have a
responsibility in terms of human rights. It's important for the
credibility of the U.N. in the countries in which we operate,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say they have no way of verifying the age of troops
provided to the United Nations, and are shifting the onus on
governments to do so in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Miyet said that it was also a ``moral obligation'' for the
United Nations not to appear to condone the use of teen-age
soldiers at a time when the organization has taken a lead in
campaigning against children in combat. The decision to set age
limits was welcomed by Carol Bellamy, executive director of UNICEF,
the U.N. children's organization, who called it ``a major
breakthrough for children's rights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``UNICEF believes that this new standard should be complemented
by specialized training on child rights of personnel involved in
peacemaking, peacekeeping and peace-building, as recently called
for by the Security Council,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF estimates that 300,000 child soldiers are participating
in conflicts around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Olara Otunnu, the secretary-general's special representative on
children in combat, also welcomed the decision. ``It will
strengthen our current efforts to promote better protection for the
most vulnerable sections of the population in peacekeeping
operations,'' he said in a statement. ``This will also help us in
the campaign to raise the age limit for the recruitment and
participation of young people in hostilities.''
</P>
<P>
   The new U.N. policy is at odds with that of the United States.
The United States and Somalia remain the only countries that have
not ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the
United States is also blocking efforts to add an amendment to that
treaty that would raise the age limit for combat from 15 to 18. The
Pentagon has held out for a 17-year-old cutoff because Americans
can take part in some military service at that age.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the U.S. obstruction is pretty shameful,'' said Jo
Becker, children's rights advocacy director for Human Rights Watch,
in an interview Thursday. Her organization welcomed the U.N. move
as a boost for an international consensus to end the practice of
sending children into wars of any kind.

   COMMENTARY: D'AMATO'S ETHICAL VACUUM  (jw) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years ago he was a king-maker, anointing George Pataki as
the GOP candidate for governor of New York and joking that Betsy
McCaughey Ross, now the lieutenant governor, should make the mayor
of New York an offer he couldn't refuse.
</P>
<P>
   There seemed to be no stopping New York's Sen. Al D'Amato. He
was always ruthless, obnoxious and compulsively crude, and there
was an enormous hole where his ethical core should have been. But
somehow on Election Day those matters would be papered over and he
would win.
</P>
<P>
   This year may be different. The senator's run for a fourth term
is being seriously undermined by his unrelentingly gross behavior _
his name-calling, his lies, his unconscionable campaign tactics,
his buffoonery. There is a growing feeling that the voters may be
tiring of him.
</P>
<P>
   I am not surprised. The flap over D'Amato's use of a vulgar
Yiddish term to describe his opponent, Charles Schumer, reminded me
of the time he was accused, in an article in The New Republic, of
calling low-income housing tenants ``animals.'' The article quoted
him as saying, early in his first Senate term: ``We didn't do too
well with the animal vote, did we?''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said he never made the ``animals'' comment, just as he
initially denied slurring Schumer. But after 18 years of vulgar
comments and disrespectful behavior, the weight of the evidence is
against him.
</P>
<P>
   This year D'Amato has eschewed any serious talk about issues
and, in his desperation, has flailed about in search of some
subject _ any subject, no matter how specious, trivial or unfair _
with which to tar his opponent. The senator has criticized Schumer
for being too liberal (he's actually a moderate Democrat), for
being from downstate and for missing votes in Congress while
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a last-minute blitz of television ads, D'Amato is
complaining about Schumer's ethics. The ads cite a 1980
investigation into whether Schumer illegally used state workers in
his first congressional campaign. If you are waiting for an ad from
D'Amato pointing out that the investigation ended with no charges
being brought against Schumer, you will wait a long, long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Al being Al,'' said a Republican strategist who is not
working for the campaign but who nevertheless asked that his name
not be used. ``If you run against Al, you're going to get
bloodied.''
</P>
<P>
   The audacity of Al D'Amato's daring to challenge the ethics of
anyone is breathtaking. He has spent his career running from the
ethics police. He was the protege of Joseph Margiotta, the Nassau
County Republican boss who ended up in federal prison on corruption
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Margiotta arranged for insurance brokers
doing business with the county and with the town of Hempstead to
split their commissions with Republican politicians. Also,
government workers during Margiotta's reign had to kick back 1
percent of their salaries to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, the Hempstead town supervisor, was implicated in the
insurance scheme but was not indicted. The grand jury said he
appointed or dismissed brokers as directed by Margiotta.
</P>
<P>
   When the kickback scheme came to light in the mid-1970s, D'Amato
said he knew nothing about it. But a decade later, a letter
surfaced that was written by him in 1971. It referred directly to
the practice. Confronted with the letter, D'Amato said, ``I suppose
there were those who probably felt there was some undue force to
contribute.'' He added, ``In retrospect, it may have been wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 the Senate Ethics Committee found that D'Amato's
brother, Armand, had used the senator's office on behalf of a law
client who was seeking a Defense Department contract. That, the
committee concluded, amounted to D'Amato's conducting ``the
business of his office in an improper and inappropriate matter.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inappropriate'' is a virtual synonym for Al D'Amato. A full
run-through of his lapses in judgment and ethics _ the illegal
campaign contributions, his shoddy role in judicial appointments,
his disheartening favors for unsavory characters _ would require a
lot more space than one column.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear to anyone who has looked closely at D'Amato's
record is that he does not enter the ethics debate with anything
like clean hands.

IN COMPROMISE, CONGRESS REVIVES WEAPONS PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a last-minute compromise, Congress has revived
the independent commission charged with streamlining the efforts of
96 federal agencies that deal with the threat of nuclear, chemical
and biological weapons, as well as the means to deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was left for dead three months ago, largely at the
hands of House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., and a top foreign
policy lieutenant, Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y. The lawmakers
objected to the scope and makeup of the panel, headed by John
Deutch, former director of the CIA, and let its legislative mandate
lapse.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's vice chairman, Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.,
resurrected it as part of the $500 billion spending bill that
Congress approved last week.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Republicans like Brent Scowcroft, national security
adviser to President George Bush, criticized Gingrich, saying he
was playing politics with a serious issue that cut across party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission is back in operation,'' Specter said. ``There's
no more important item on the federal agenda than weapons of mass
destruction, and right now we're not addressing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich and Gilman extracted concessions from Specter and the
Clinton administration, however. Under the accord four new members
picked by the speaker and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott,
R-Miss., will join the panel, evening the number of appointees from
each party at six apiece.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gilman objected to the presence of the president's
special envoy on proliferation issues, Robert Gallucci, on the
panel, saying that was a conflict of interest. Gallucci, dean of
the Georgetown University Foreign Service School, agreed to leave,
Senate aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Congress set up the panel, the Commission to Assess the
Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation
of Weapons of Mass Destruction, in October 1996. Its mandate was to
untangle the overlapping jurisdictions that try to fight the spread
of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the means to
deliver them.
</P>
<P>
   But the commission had growing pains. It took President Clinton
14 months to name his four choices to the panel, and that delayed
its first meeting until last Jan. 29.
</P>
<P>
   Under the compromise the commission will have until June to
finish its work and submit a report. &QL;

DNA TESTS OFFER EVIDENCE THAT JEFFERSON FATHERED A CHILD WITH HIS
SLAVE

 BY DINITIA SMITH AND NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DNA tests performed on the descendants of Thomas Jefferson's
family and of Jefferson's young slave, Sally Hemings, offer
compelling new evidence that the third president of the United
States fathered at least one of her children as has long been
speculated, according to an article in the next issue of the
scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on blood samples collected by Eugene A.
Foster, a retired pathologist who lives in Charlottesville, Va. The
finding undercuts the position of historians who have long said
that Jefferson did not have a liaison with the slave some 28 years
his junior and confirms, but with a surprising twist, the oral
tradition that has been handed down among Sally Hemings'
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence is likely to send historians scurrying to
re-evaluate Jefferson, particularly his role in the anti-slavery
movement. It may also have a wider resonance. The accusation of an
affair with Hemings, one of several charges considered in a mock
impeachment trial staged by the Massachusetts state Legislature in
1805, was indirectly denied by Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with impeccable timing,'' the historian Joseph Ellis and
the geneticist Eric Lander write in a joint commentary on the new
report, ``Jefferson reappears to remind us of a truth that should
be self-evident. Our heroes _ and especially presidents _ are not
gods or saints, but flesh-and-blood humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's finding rests on analysis of the Y chromosome, an
unusual genetic component because, except at its very tips, it
escapes the shuffling of the genetic material that occurs between
every generation. The only changes on the Y chromosome are rare
sporadic mutations in the DNA that accumulate slowly over
centuries. Male lineages can therefore be distinguished from one
another through the characteristic set of mutations carried in
their Y chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said he began his research almost on a whim, at a
friend's suggestion. He soon grew more serious, and with the help
of many colleagues, has tracked down four male lineages that bear
on the paternity of Sally Hemings' children. They are Jefferson's
lineage, derived from his paternal grandfather; the lineages of Tom
Woodson and Eston Hemings Jefferson, Sally Hemings' oldest and
youngest sons; and the lineage of the Carrs, two of Jefferson's
nephews on his sister's side.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hemings had other children, but they left no surviving
male heirs. The Carrs come into the picture because of the story
spread by Jefferson's heirs that one or the other of the nephews
fathered Hemings' children, explaining their pronounced resemblance
to the Jeffersons.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's samples were analyzed by Christopher Tyler-Smith, a
population geneticist at the University of Oxford in England, and
his colleagues. They found that the Jeffersonian Y chromosome had a
distinctive set of mutations, unmatched in any of 1,200, mostly
European, men who were analyzed by the same method.
</P>
<P>
   The set of mutations on the Y chromosomes of three descendants
of John Carr were almost identical to one another and different
from the Jeffersonian chromosome, ruling out the Carrs as possible
fathers.
</P>
<P>
   The Y chromosome of a descendant of Eston Hemings Jefferson made
a perfect match to Jefferson's, but those of five descendants of
Thomas Woodson were completely different.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simplest and most probable explanations'' for the
findings, Foster and colleagues report, ``are that Thomas
Jefferson, rather than one of the Carr brothers, was the father of
Eston Hemings Jefferson, and that Thomas Woodson was not Thomas
Jefferson's son.''
</P>
<P>
   Lander, a DNA expert at the Whitehead Institute in Boston, said
Foster's evidence showed there was a less than 1 percent chance
that a person chosen at random would share the same set of Y
chromosome mutations that exist in the Jefferson lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that Eston Hemings' descendant has this rare
chromosome, together with the historical evidence, seals the case
that Jefferson fathered Eston,'' Lander said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The evidence that Thomas Woodson was not Jefferson's son is
surprising, Foster said, because of the particularly strong oral
tradition that has come down independently in the five lines of the
Woodson family. Woodson, born shortly after Jefferson's return from
his service as minister in Paris, was 12 when James Callender, a
journalist, published accusations in a Richmond newspaper that
Jefferson was Hemings' lover. Shortly afterward, Woodson was sent
off to live with a relative.
</P>
<P>
   One of the blood samples in the study was taken from John
Jefferson, 52, of Norrisville, Pa., who is believed to be a direct
descendant of Hemings through Eston Hemings Jefferson. John
Jefferson's Y chromosome matched blood samples taken from the
lineal descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Jefferson said he was not particularly
surprised at the news that he was descended from a president and
his slave. ``I've known it practically all my life,'' said
Jefferson, who is disabled and does not work. ``I guess I was happy
about it, but not really surprised since I've believed it all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's sister, Julia Jefferson Westerinen, 64, had a more
ebullient reaction. ``Isn't that wild,'' said Ms. Westerinen, who
lives on Staten Island and sells furniture and office equipment to
architects and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known for about 15 years, but I thought I was related to
Jefferson's nephew,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gillespie, a lawyer in Richmond who is the head of the
Monticello Association, which includes the descendants of
Jefferson's two daughters, said, ``We've always agreed with
mainstream historians that Jefferson wouldn't have fathered Sally
Hemings' children.'' But, Gillespie said, the DNA results are
``changing my attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said he had always believed that ``Jefferson would
have shown the second set of children love and affection just as he
did the first set. Apparently he was a product of the 18th century,
and had a double standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis, author of ``American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas
Jefferson,'' (Knopf, 1997), and other Jefferson scholars like Dumas
Malone have long said that Jefferson did not have a relationship
with Hemings. Ellis once dismissed the possibility as ``a tin can
tied to Jefferson's reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he said, the DNA tests have changed his mind. ``This
evidence is new evidence and it seems to me to be clinching,'' he
said. Ellis said circumstantial evidence, including a quotation
attributed to another of Hemings' sons, James Madison, also pointed
to a liaison. ``It includes the timing of her pregnancies, the
physical resemblance of her children to Jefferson and Madison
saying late in life that his mother told him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well before Y chromosome testing entered the picture, a minority
of historians were asserting that Jefferson had the affair, notably
Fawn Brodie, in her book ``Thomas Jefferson: An Intimate History.''
Another scholar, Annette Gordon-Reed, an associate professor of law
at New York Law School and author of ``Thomas Jefferson and Sally
Hemings: An American Controversy'' (University Press of Virginia),
said she felt vindicated by the DNA tests. ``If people had accepted
this story, he would never have become an icon,'' Professor
Gordon-Reed said. ``All these historians did him a favor until we
could get past our primitive racism. I don't think he would have
been on Mount Rushmore or on the nickel. The personification of
America can't live 38 years with a black woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The new DNA evidence is likely to renew questions about
Jefferson's position on slavery, Lander and Ellis believe.
``Jefferson's stated reservations about ending slavery included a
fear that emancipation would lead to racial mixing and
amalgamation,'' they wrote in their commentary in Nature. ``His own
interracial affair now personalizes this issue, while adding a
dimension of hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sally Hemings, who was born in 1772 or 1773, was the
illegitimate half-sister of Jefferson's wife, Martha, the offspring
of a relationship between John Wayles and Elizabeth (Betty)
Hemings, a slave. Sally became Jefferson's property when he
inherited the Wayles estate in 1774, and arrived at Monticello as a
little girl in 1776. She was later described by one of Jefferson's
slaves, Isaac Jefferson, as ``mighty near white . . . very
handsome, long straight hair down her back.'' Jefferson's grandson,
Thomas Jefferson Randolph, described her as ``light colored and
decidedly good looking.''
</P>
<P>
   In her early childhood, Hemings probably acted as a ``nurse'' to
Jefferson's daughter, Mary, a custom in slave culture. Then in
1787, Jefferson, a widower, who was then the U.S. ambassador to
France, summoned his daughter Maria to live with him. Maria was
accompanied by her young attendant, Sally, who was then about 13.
Sally's son Madison, who was born in 1805, at the end of his life
said that his mother became Jefferson's ``concubine'' in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In 1789, Sally Hemings returned with the Jefferson family to
Virginia. By then, Sally was 16 or 17, and pregnant, according to
Madison Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   Her first child, Thomas, who the new studies say was not
genetically linked to Jefferson, was born soon after her return.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's grandson, Thomas Jefferson Randolph, said later that
the boy looked like Thomas Jefferson. ``At some distance or in the
dusk the slave, dressed in the same way, might have been mistaken
for Mr. Jefferson,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence of Jefferson's relationship with Hemings will only
add to a re-evaluation of Jefferson that has been going on among
historians for some time, Ellis said. ``The take on Jefferson for
30 years or so has become more and more critical,'' he said.
``Increasingly, he is a window in which race and slavery are the
panes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, as portrayed by Ellis and others, was an ambivalent
figure. ``He plays hide and seek within himself,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   But most Americans, he predicted, would have a kinder reaction
to what he called ``the longest-running mini-series in American
history.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the larger world,'' Ellis said, ``the dominant response
will be Jefferson is more human, to regard this as evidence of his
frailties, frailties that seem more like us. The urge to regard him
as an American icon will overwhelm any desire to take him off his
pedestal.''

<P>
   The monitor was quiet as Schwalm started up the stairs. But
halfway up he paused. The meter was buzzing like an electric razor.
</P>
<P>
   The meter was quiet throughout the rest of the church, except
for spots under the St. Alban's window and on the right side of the
altar, where it became extremely active. The altar, which was
installed in 1888, was dedicated to Jardine.
</P>
<P>
   Schwalm, who has been a member of the church nearly 50 years,
became interested in the ``haunting'' after several conversations
with the Rev. Edwin Merrill, a former St. Mary's rector.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he frequently heard bumps and knocks and creaks
around the altar and also frequently heard steps like somebody was
coming up the back stairs to where he (Merrill) lived,'' Schwalm
said. ``He assumed all this was connected with Father Jardine.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwalm wasn't convinced, he said, until he took photographs of
the altar one afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When the photos were developed, Schwalm said, he saw objects
that he hadn't seen through the lens: a sheetlike monk carrying a
candle and a skull-like profile that he said was identifiable as
one of Jardine's old enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Schwalm said he turned up other oddities. The rector reported
cold spots on the back stairs. An alarm service reported tower
doors open in the middle of the night. An organ repairman said his
dog tracked an invisible object across the room.
</P>
<P>
   Then one afternoon in 1977, Schwalm said, ``I saw Jardine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was smiling, wearing the robes of a monk. But instead of a
rope around his waist, he wore his chain. He was levitating
slightly, and he had an aura of light around his entire body.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwalm said he hadn't seen the apparition since.
</P>
<P>
   Why may Jardine be ``haunting'' the church?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he thinks his record was never made clear,'' Schwalm
said. ``He was tried and found guilty, then he died, and there was
no opportunity for a retrial.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwalm also said he thought Jardine might want to avenge his
possible murder.
</P>
<P>
   The church's current priest smiles when Jardine's name comes up.
In fact, after eight years, he's still trying to figure out what to
make of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe there's some benign presence here that is helping
us,'' Rahtjen said. ``Otherwise, we could never have accomplished
all the things that we have in this congregation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what it is, I have no idea.''

<P>
   Western Auto executives have spent the last few weeks spreading
the word that what is left of Western Auto can survive. Dan Wilson,
president of Parts America, will become head of the local
operations. Advance Auto Parts says it will support the operations
remaining here.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 170 employees remaining in Kansas City after the
purchase by Advance will oversee 40 Western Auto stores owned by
the company in Puerto Rico. They also will oversee 767 franchise
and dealer stores, mostly in small towns, which accounted for about
20 percent of Western Auto's $1.3 billion in revenues last year.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, chief executive of Advance Auto Parts, said Wednesday
that the company also planned to open a warehouse in the Kansas
City area next year that would deliver auto parts to Advance stores
in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Western Auto's Parts America stores, including those in the
Kansas City area, are to be renamed Advance Auto Parts and will
report to Roanoke. Shaffer said that employees in the stores and
the district offices had been offered jobs with the new owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to give our people a new opportunity,'' Shaffer
said.

 CATSKILL TROUT RIVERS RECOVER, WITH HELP 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 BY MITCH KELLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Jan. 19, 1996, heavy rains and melting snow caused ruinous
flooding in the Catskill Mountains. The many fine rivers that make
the Catskills the heart of Eastern trout fishing, among them the
East and West Branches of the Delaware, the Beaverkill and the
Esopus, rose to claim their natural flood plains and everything
unnatural that lay within them.
</P>
<P>
   In the rubble-strewn aftermath, it was not surprising that some
people looked upon the rivers with resentment and distrust. What
happened next quickly escalated into a kind of eco-scandal whose
impact on the streams is only now, more than two years later,
starting to be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Determined not only to clean up from the floods but to make sure
the unruly streams behaved in the future, landowners and public
road crews went to work on them with bucket loaders and bulldozers.
Channels were dredged and straightened, banks denuded and reshaped.
Tributaries were turned into glorified roadside ditches. Because of
all the work, which was financed by more than $8 million in federal
and state disaster relief, the typically lucent Catskill streams
often ran brown.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation, in
particular its regional sub-office in Delaware County, was severely
criticized by Trout Unlimited, a national conservation group, for
rubber-stamping hundreds of permits for such work and not acting on
reported violations. After Trout Unlimited threatened to sue, the
two adversaries embarked on long negotiations that ended with a
signed agreement to restore the damaged streams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of bitterness and negativity over the last
couple of years,'' said Jock Conyngham, an ecologist for Trout
Unlimited. ``But that's all evaporating now and we're starting to
work together.''
</P>
<P>
   Work toward the first goal of the agreement, the restoration of
several tributaries of the legendary Beaverkill, has begun.
Probably the worst effect of the post-flood stream work was the
mangling of tributaries and the blocking of access to them by
trout, which use them for spawning and for the relief their cooler
temperatures provide when main rivers turn dangerously warm in
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental department committed $125,000 to get the
tributary project under way, and in September it secured $500,000
from the state's Clean Water/Clean Air Bond Act to expand the
project to tributaries of the East Branch of the Delaware.
Conyngham, who leads restoration work for Trout Unlimited, said
commitments to help with financing had been made by a number of
public and private sources, including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service, the National Parks Service and Orvis Co.
</P>
<P>
   The aim of the tributary work, according to Conyngham and
others, is to rebuild and stabilize damaged areas by replicating
sections of the streams that survived the violent flood currents
intact, thus demonstrating their natural structural soundness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to try to establish something that may not look
exactly as it did before the flood but that has the physical
characteristics and geometry of areas that survived the flood,''
Conyngham said.
</P>
<P>
   These characteristics pertain to bends and meander patterns; the
width and depth of channels; riffles, pools and plunges, bank
vegetation and the flood plain.
</P>
<P>
   This ``natural channel'' approach to stream restoration is based
on the principle that the natural structure and design of a river
provides not only the esthetic and ecological ideal but also the
best flood control. It thus departs radically from the view that
rivers can and should be controlled with artificial barriers and
channelizations, which may seem to work over the short term but
leave banks and channels so destabilized that they are certain to
blow out one day.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between Trout Unlimited and the environmental
department will remain in effect until the work is finished or
2004, whichever comes first. In the meantime, nature has been doing
its own part to restore the Catskill trout habitat.
</P>
<P>
   In the season after the floods, hatches of the delicate aquatic
insects that trout need for food were sparse or nonexistent, the
fierce January currents having scoured the river bottoms so
thoroughly that countless insect larvae dwelling there were
destroyed. The assault of the heavy machinery doubtless killed
more.
</P>
<P>
   In the season now ending, though, the hatches have generally
been described as good to excellent. Fisheries experts say
outstanding hatches are not surprising in the third season after a
major flood. In churning up the river bottoms, blowing out
sediment, overturning stones and loosening gravel, the same
currents that destroy so many larvae and pupae leave behind
well-scrubbed, more commodious stream beds in which mayflies and
caddis can re-establish themselves and thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Trout do not bounce back so quickly. Virtually the entire issue
of wild trout that would have hatched from eggs in the spring of
1996 was wiped out by the flood waters. This year, as 2-year-olds,
those fish would have become a significant presence in the rivers,
ranging in size from a mere seven or eight inches to upwards of a
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the following spring seems to have yielded an
unusually high number of wild baby trout, according to Kay Sanford,
a fisheries biologist with Region 4 of the environmental department
One possible explanation is that the scouring of the river bottoms
that ultimately led to fine insect hatches had similar consequences
for the propagation of trout, whose eggs incubate in stream bed
gravel.

GEPHARDT ROUSES DEMOCRATIC BASE IN WHIRLWIND CAMPAIGN VISITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EVANSVILLE, Ind. _ It's 10:30 on a Monday morning, the workweek
well under way on this city's blue-collar west side.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Sheet Metal Workers headquarters on West Franklin
Street, with its scarred green and white checkerboard linoleum
floor, 100 or so union members just got their latest job laid out
in no uncertain terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``This election will be decided by you,'' House Minority Leader
Richard Gephardt told them, his jacket off, his voice rising. ``It
isn't decided by TV ads. It isn't decided by money.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that the Republicans have tons more money and have just
kicked off a last minute, multimillion-dollar advertising blitz, he
could hardly say anything less. But it was still classic Gephardt,
one of labor's best friends on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a plea he repeated over and over on a recent autumn
journey across a sliver of America where the political temperature
has begun to feel like the hottest day in July.
</P>
<P>
   From the Ohio River valley to the edge of Lake Michigan, the
Missouri Democrat parachuted into a handful of extremely close
congressional contests to ignite the hopes and fears of voters. The
budget fight had already forced him to cut short a recent Western
campaign swing.
</P>
<P>
   But even as most predict that the Republicans will come out of
Election Day stronger, Gephardt and his party take cautious cheer
that a number of House races, like those he visited in Indiana,
Ohio and Wisconsin, remain razor-close.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome Tuesday, there and throughout the country, could
shape his party's future. And for someone who still harbors White
House ambitions, his own, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Each victory, each defeat, will figure into the larger equation
of how the party is positioned in Congress in the two years leading
up to the 2000 presidential campaign and into Gephardt's own
political calculus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a good shot of winning seats,'' he said after
stumping in Cincinnati's 1st District, among the tightest races in
the country. ``Politics is like football. You always want forward
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats in this topsy-turvy political season, forward
progress could actually mean not losing too much ground.
</P>
<P>
   The party in the White House traditionally gives up seats in
midterm elections. But after President Clinton's admission in
August that he had lied about an extramarital affair, Democrats far
and wide were signaling mayday.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the deadline for voters to decide can be measured in
just hours, the Democrats hope they have smothered their anxieties
by focusing on their holy trinity of causes: Social Security,
health care and education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make lemonade out of lemons,'' Gephardt said,
discussing the effects of the Clinton scandals one afternoon
between campaign stops. ``We're trying to put this thing back
together. But I think we've come an awful long way from a couple of
months ago. There were some awful dark days where it looked liked
things were falling apart on us.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain, Gephardt told a fund-raising breakfast in
an Evansville home, where people had dropped checks of $250 and
$100 into a basket in the front hall: ``If we get the vote out,
then we will win; it's that simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, of course, say the same thing about the close
contests, but with even greater confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've seen is a very steady movement in our direction,''
said Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee.
</P>
<P>
   She predicted a net gain of 10 to 15 seats on top of the 11-seat
margin the GOP enjoys in the House. She said Republicans also
weren't ruling out a victory big enough to drop the Democrats below
200 seats, putting them at a ``tremendous psychological
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   In Evansville, one of the anchors of Indiana's 8th District,
exciting the Democratic base is crucial to any chance the party has
of winning a Republican-held seat. If the Democrats do so, it will
be in keeping with a district known as ``the Bloody Eighth''
because of its frequent political shifts and the brutal political
warfare that accompanies them. The district elected different
congressmen in four successive elections in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   This year the race between Republican Rep. John Hostettler and
Gail Riecken, a Democratic city councilwoman, draws on each party's
familiar arsenal of attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Hostettler, elected in 1994 with strong backing from Christian
fundamentalist and anti-abortion groups, labels Riecken a liberal
with support from ``radical environmental groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Riecken ran an ad that portrayed a woman whose managed-care
company wouldn't approve a Caesarean section and whose child was
born with brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this district, people are very much into bread-and-butter
issues,'' Riecken said. ``They truly are concerned about things
like managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Knight, Hostettler campaign chairman, predicted a ``solid''
win, which he said meant a margin of only about 2 percent or 3
percent. That was his margin in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Up the Ohio River in Cincinnati, the exchanges are equally sharp
in a closely watched race between Republican Rep. Steve Chabot and
Democratic Mayor Roxanne Qualls. Tax increases, late-term abortions
and the budget surplus have been debated. The Clinton scandals
haven't been, even though Chabot is a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, which will decide whether to recommend impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt, who along with Clinton encouraged Qualls to run, spent
a whirlwind afternoon in Cincinnati. He urged labor leaders to up
the ante on their get-out-the-vote efforts, spoke with senior
citizens about Social Security and, with Qualls, greeted voters
outside the offices of Cincinnati Bell. MORE

UNIONS MUST FACE EVOLUTION OF AUTO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ The strike rumblings at the General Motors
Fairfax assembly plant are a fresh reminder of why the unionized
American autoworker is perhaps a generation away from extinction.
</P>
<P>
   The recent vote at the Kansas City, Kan., plant didn't authorize
a strike, but instead enabled the local to request strike
permission from union headquarters if grievances can't be resolved.
The complaints involve health and safety issues that the union
contends involve too much work being demanded of too few workers.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation recalled an analysis in Forbes last year by
business journalist Jerry Flint, who has covered the auto industry
for nearly four decades. Flint's bottom-line contention was that
the Big Three automakers need to gather with the United Auto
Workers at a summit ``to talk about bringing down costs without
driving the (auto) industry outside the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand dream of every top auto executive in the world, Flint
said, is to trim production payrolls. This dream is what drives
``outsourcing,'' which is the practice of making and assembling as
much of the vehicle as possible outside the company plant.
</P>
<P>
   Outsourcing is also the practice that drives much of the current
rancor between the UAW and the Big Three, although GM seems to
generate much more labor conflict in the process than do Ford or
Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Flint predicted, this is the way of the future not
only because supplier workers cost less than company workers, but
also because outsourcing shifts a significant portion of the
capital costs to suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, what puts today's unionized autoworker particularly
at risk is the worldwide scope of auto manufacturing and the glut
of global production capacity that has come on line this decade. An
example of how substantial this problem can become was last year's
collapse of South Korea's Kia Motors, which was a critical
contributing factor to the country's economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With overall global growth forecast to slow to less than 2
percent next year, the growing prospect of more overseas auto
industry problems is like a dark cloud hanging over many of Asia's
already struggling economies. It's such a serious problem because
wherever the industry exists, it's always a major economic force.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is in America. Traditionally the U.S. industry has
been credited with directly and indirectly creating one of every
six American jobs. Over the past two decades, however, the
industry's unionized work force subtracted from that mix rather
than added to it.
</P>
<P>
   The Fairfax case is instructive because it tends to validate
Flint's point. The good news is that demand for vehicles from
Fairfax seems strong. The bad news is that GM prefers to meet the
challenge by requiring the existing work force to do the job on
overtime instead of adding workers.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? The last thing the industry wants is the added costs
of more workers. This is a fact of life in America, Brazil, South
Korea, Japan and anywhere else cars are made.
</P>
<P>
   This is also a fact of life the UAW must confront as it sorts
out its future relationship with the Big Three. The short-term
solution, which has been confrontation, won't help in the long run.
This is so even if the workers' cause is righteous.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who doubts the reality of the challenges ahead should
ponder the declining trend line of domestic plant construction by
America's automakers in recent years.

WITH WESTERN AUTO CHANGING HANDS, AN ERA ENDS IN KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ From the beginning, Western Auto and Kansas
City were a package.
</P>
<P>
   It began in 1909 when a young man drew inspiration for the
company from Model-T Fords tooling around town. It continued with
Kansas City being home to Western Auto's headquarters for the last
89 years.
</P>
<P>
   But an era is drawing to a close. New owners are to take control
of the company as early as today, and much of Western Auto's
corporate presence here will begin to be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Just two years ago Western Auto employed more than 600 people in
its headquarters. Soon that number will dwindle to about 170.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, much is going to change when Advance Auto Parts of
Roanoke, Va., takes over from Sears, Roebuck and Co., which has
owned Western Auto since 1988. There will be only one headquarters
for the combined company, and it will be in Roanoke. The Kansas
City headquarters topped by a huge neon sign might even be sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``In an ideal world we would have liked to have saved both
headquarters, but in the competitive world this was not meant to
be,'' said Garnett Smith, chief executive officer of Advance.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the 400 remaining employees at Western Auto's
Kansas City headquarters will have to find other jobs in the next
few months. The first batch _ 30 persons _ are out today, albeit
with severance packages. About 30 others will transfer to Roanoke.
</P>
<P>
   Western Auto began with an idea and a $5 loan.
</P>
<P>
   George Pepperdine, who grew up as a poor Kansas farm boy and
attended a few business classes in Parsons, had taken a job in
Kansas City as a bookkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   Then he saw the cars in Kansas City. He printed some handbills
advertising automobile accessories and tires _ a medium-sized horn
cost $1.75. The $5 loan bought the stamps to mail the handbills to
customers. First-year sales were $12,000.
</P>
<P>
   By 1913, Western Auto had its first retail store. But a case of
tuberculosis forced Pepperdine to move west in 1916. He sold
Western Auto to a business associate with the provision that he
could open Western Auto stores in 11 states.
</P>
<P>
   The two Western Auto companies were combined in the late 1930s.
Pepperdine earned $7 million in the deal, and he used half of it to
open Pepperdine College, which is now Pepperdine University, in
California.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s he gave his money to charities, with Pepperdine
College getting the biggest chunk because, he told the Los Angeles
Times, he hadn't been able to get an education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider it wrong to build a great fortune and use it
selfishly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine died broke in Los Angeles in 1962, two years after he
wrote his autobiography, Faith Is My Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Western Auto adapted to the times. After
World War II it started selling refrigerators and household goods
because automobiles were getting more reliable and needing fewer
parts.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s it renewed its emphasis on auto parts after
Wal-Mart and other discounters began to sell household goods
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   By then the company was owned by Beneficial Financial Group,
which sold it in the 1980s to an investment group led by former
U.S. Treasury Secretary William Simon. Later it was sold to Sears.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, the headquarters remained in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   In August, however, Sears announced plans to sell to Advance,
saying it would create a stronger company. Sears will get 40
percent of Advance in the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The decision has angered many associated with Western Auto who
say that Sears could have done more to save it.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Candler is one of them. He went to work for Western Auto
in the 1930s in Kansas City and opened a Western Auto store in
Plattsburg, Mo., in 1953, which he still runs today.
</P>
<P>
   Sears ``got all the goodies from us, and now they're through
with us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Western Auto franchisees in West Virginia and Ohio recently
sued Sears, claiming that Sears had withdrawn support services in
the last two years. Sears officials declined to comment on the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Others question Western Auto's decision to revamp the company
two years ago. Donald Shaffer, chief executive officer of Western
Auto, said that Western Auto's traditional business of
company-owned stores selling auto parts and service was beginning
to decline.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer, who revived Sears' Canadian operations, had been
brought in to make the changes at Western Auto. The service bays
were eliminated, in part because of the difficulty in finding
mechanics and the liability involved.
</P>
<P>
   The company-owned stores were renamed Parts America, and they
sold only auto parts. The decision, according to some analysts, was
misguided because it put them up against stiff competitors such as
AutoZone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were asking Western Auto to do too much,'' said Stephen
Latz, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Sears doesn't break out its Western Auto earnings from the rest
of the company's performance. Crain's Chicago Business reported in
June that Western Auto earned $80 million in 1995. In 1997 it had a
loss of $80 million.
</P>
<P>
   Shaffer did not disclose Western Auto's financial results. He
said that there were costs in making the transition to Parts
America but that the company's financial results had been improving
each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was absolutely the right decision,'' said Shaffer.
</P>
<P>
   But time ran out. Competitors were becoming bigger through
acquisitions, and Western Auto had to get bigger, Shaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either go out and start acquiring or be acquired,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Western Auto once was considered almost too big.
Forty years ago it had 4,000 stores. When a suitor wanted to
combine Western Auto with another company, the federal government
stopped it because of antitrust issues. MORE

   EVANSVILLE, Ind. _ of Cincinnati Bell.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days of a campaign that only lately has begun to
energize the Democrats, he is a familiar _ and welcome _ sight
along the circuit of kaffeeklatsches and union halls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gephardt is one of us,'' said Dan Radford, secretary-treasurer
of the Central Labor Council of Greater Cincinnati. ``And just
having the next speaker of the House has to be an indication of the
importance of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Wishful thinking, to be sure. Even Gephardt, ever optimistic but
always realistic, knows he has little chance of being elevated from
minority leader to speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think we're in a period where you have a re-energized
Republican Party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has an image of being colorless. Yet at campaign rallies he
scorches Republicans for their support from the ``special
interests'' that he claims led them to kill legislation that would
have restricted tobacco use, reformed campaign spending and given
medical patients more options.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt also never fails to mention the ``Newt Gingrich tax
cut,'' the failed Republican attempt to use 10 percent of the
budget surplus for a tax cut instead of keeping all of it for
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing him exhort a group of senior citizens to encourage
their neighbors to vote, Patricia Erb, a Cincinnati ward
chairwoman, said with pride that she was already on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Besides having runners ready to get voters to the polls and
others to buttonhole them outside the polls, Erb said: ``I even
went into an apartment house filled with AIDS patients and I got
them registered and got them to vote absentee. They voted, and
they're in already.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt knows it will take an army of Patricia Erbs for the
Democrats to salvage the election.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said as he headed toward another airport and another
campaign stop: ``A lot of what life is about is believing in
something. You've got to be fired up.''

RECTOR'S GHOST `HAUNTS' CHURCH, SOME SAY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Rev. Henry David Jardine came to Kansas
City in 1879, a young priest eager to serve his flock. But Jardine
soon became the focus of one of the biggest church scandals the
city had known. Six years later, he died mysteriously, a chain
welded around his waist and a bottle of chloroform at his side.
Though Jardine has been dead more than 100 years, some think he
never left St. Mary's Episcopal Church.
</P>
<P>
   His ghost is still there, they say, searching for something.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Bruce Rahtjen turned from the front of the marble altar
and motioned toward a painted-glass window on the second floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of parishioners have said that when they're in here
at night by themselves, they feel some kind of presence,'' Rahtjen
said quietly as the afternoon sunlight cast an eerie glow on the
visitors below. ``And they invariably point to that window.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this sounds bizarre, but I've felt it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Other members of St. Mary's Episcopal Church say they've not
only felt it, they've seen it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to cook down there on Mondays for the Tuesday food
pantry,'' said Annamarie Manzo. ``Around 9:30, I started hearing
funny noises. I went into the main sanctuary, and there was this
strong incense smell all over the place.''
</P>
<P>
   The church burns incense during its Sunday high Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then I swear I saw something white floating around. Like a
cloud,'' Manzo said. ``I live in an 88-year-old house, and I'm used
to old-house things. But this was something different.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago Keith Gottschall stopped by St. Mary's late one
night to visit a friend who was arranging altar decorations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I pulled into the parking lot, I noticed a figure moving
past the window on the second floor of the church, which is kept
locked,'' said Gottschall, who has been a church member a dozen
years. ``It looked like a man, but it moved quickly, like it wasn't
walking but floating.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottschall went inside, figuring his friend had brought along
another friend, Billy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's Billy?'' Gottschall asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean? No one's here but me,'' his friend
responded.
</P>
<P>
   Gottschall climbed the back staircase and found the door locked
at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I can tell you, I was not going to proceed any further,''
he said. ``There was no doubt in my mind that something had been up
there. I know what I saw. Now I don't like to be down there at
night. And certainly not by myself.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Mary's was founded in 1857 as St. Luke's Church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1879, Henry David Jardine came to town to become the church's
rector. Before long, the priest was being criticized for his zeal
to create a parish that accepted rituals unpopular in a
conservative church.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to oust Jardine, influential members of the
community in 1884 brought charges against him, accusing him of
immoral behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was learned that, as a youth, Jardine had broken into
his brother-in-law's store and stolen a large amount of goods. He
served two years in a New York prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1885 an ecclesiastical court found Jardine guilty of improper
conduct toward a girl, indecent conduct toward women who had gone
to his confessional and using narcotics. The narcotics charge arose
from the fact that Jardine was addicted to chloroform, which he
used to alleviate a nervous affliction.
</P>
<P>
   Jardine appealed his removal as rector and as a last resort made
a personal plea to the bishop in St. Louis. On Jan. 5, 1886, he
visited the St. Louis church of his old friend, the Rev. George C.
Betts, and then spent the next four days working on getting
reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   Jardine's efforts failed. And on the morning of Jan. 10, Betts
entered the sacristy where Jardine had been sleeping and found his
friend dead.
</P>
<P>
   Covering his face was a small handkerchief. By his side, a
bottle of chloroform.
</P>
<P>
   Those preparing Jardine's body for burial made another bizarre
discovery: A chain had been welded around the priest's waist,
rusted as if it had been worn a long time. Chain marks were
embedded in his flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Many assumed that Jardine had been wearing the chain as penance
for his youthful crimes. Others said the priest wore the chain to
keep from levitating at the altar, which he was rumored to have
done on occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Some thought Jardine's death was a suicide. Those who saw him as
a martyr said it was accidental.
</P>
<P>
   But psychic and self-proclaimed ``ghostbuster'' Maurice Schwalm
of Kansas City said he thought Jardine was murdered by one of his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Jardine's colorful story is recounted in a 1949
best-selling novel, The Chain, by Paul I. Wellman of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Jardine's body was buried in Forest Hills
Cemetery in Kansas City. Along with his body was a box of personal
belongings, including the chain.
</P>
<P>
   Schwalm, whose own book, Mo-Kan Ghosts, is to be released in the
spring, said he thought Jardine _ or at least his chain _ might
have been secretly buried in the basement of St. Mary's, under the
painted-glass window of St. Alban, a British martyr.
</P>
<P>
   The narrow, twisting staircase at the rear of the church was
made for a good ghost story. Barely wide enough for one person, the
wooden stairs creak with each step. Above, the vaulted ceilings and
Gothic-style brick arches keep the area cool and shadowy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say they get part way up these stairs and feel a
cold draft,'' Rahtjen said on a recent tour. He pointed to a window
halfway up the steps. ``I say that's the culprit.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwalm isn't so sure. He had brought along a gauss meter, which
measures magnetic field strength. The presence of ghosts, Schwalm
contends, increases the strength of magnetic fields. MORE

NO WARM WELCOME FOR RAIDERS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Even as Los Angeles seeks a professional football
team, officials had a short message Friday for Al Davis and his
Oakland Raiders: Stay home.
</P>
<P>
   On a 10-3 vote, the council adopted a resolution from Councilman
Hal Bernson saying Los Angeles never wants the Raiders or Davis to
darken the doorstep of Los Angeles again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather have no football here ever again than have the
Raiders back,'' Bernson said. ``To let Al Davis in here again would
be like ... letting him have his way.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Allen, director of football operations for the Raiders,
said Davis has not decided on what he will do and won't until after
the football season.
</P>
<P>
   But he indicated the council vote wouldn't play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once again, they are proving that they are politicians out of
step with their constituents,'' Allen said. ``This is the same
group that lost two professional football teams, UCLA, the NBA and
NHL. So they're doing well.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution caused some concern on the part of Councilman
Mark Ridley-Thomas, who only days earlier had met with National
Football League team owners to make a new pitch to have a remodeled
Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum considered as the home for a new pro
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a sensitive point, and I am very conscious of the
downside of any discussion that talks about a specific
organization,'' Ridley-Thomas said. ``We should be judicious in how
we proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley-Thomas and fellow council members Nate Holden and Mike
Hernandez opposed the resolution, saying it should be studied
further.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know all I need to know to make the decision that we don't
want Al Davis or the Raiders back in this city,'' Wachs said.
``There is no amount of staff work that can change my mind about
that. The quicker we make our views known, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders left Los Angeles four years ago after 10 tumultuous
years of confrontation over various issues including the Coliseum,
which was the Raiders' home field.
</P>
<P>
   Davis insists he still holds the rights to have a football team
in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of officials say they want an expansion team for
Los Angeles rather than one already in existence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to see us have a team that is locally owned and owes
its loyalty to the city,'' Councilman Richard Alatorre said. ``I
have nothing against Mr. Davis. He's a sharp, clever guy. But how
many times do we have to be given a rude awakening as to the
integrity and veracity of one person's word?''

PERIPHERAL FIGURE FEELS HEAT OF STARR'S INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va.)  (lb) 
 By JILL ABRAMSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Julie Hiatt Steele is only a peripheral figure in
the investigation of President Clinton. But she is still attracting
a lot of attention from Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Starr's office called Ms. Steele's daughter and
brother before a grand jury in Alexandria, Va., questioning them
for hours. Her former lawyer has also been summoned, as has her
accountant.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele herself has made two grand-jury appearances. Starr's
office has subpoenaed her bank records and credit history, while
FBI agents working for the independent counsel questioned her
neighbors and have tracked down friends as far away as Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele, 52, is divorced and lives with her adopted son in
Richmond, Va. She has found herself in Starr's investigative cross
hairs because of her association with Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Willey, herself a secondary figure in the Starr
investigation, is a former White House volunteer who accused the
president of making an unwelcome sexual advance toward her at the
White House in 1993. Ms. Steele initially confirmed aspects of Ms.
Willey's account, but now disavows it and swears that her former
friend asked her to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the case said Starr was actively exploring
whether anyone associated with Clinton, who has denied the Willey
encounter, has intimidated Ms. Willey or tried to influence her
testimony. Ms. Steele has become a subject of that investigation _
Starr wants to know why she changed her story _ and is worried that
she may be charged with perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is investigating whether Clinton lied when he denied the
Willey matter both in his deposition in the Paula Jones sexual
misconduct suit and in his grand jury testimony. Starr could refer
additional impeachment charges to Congress, according to recent
correspondence between his office and the House Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's been more than I can handle,'' Ms. Steele said
during an interview in her lawyer's office, explaining how she
stands in the way of a possible Starr referral. ``You feel like an
entrapped animal.''
</P>
<P>
   That Starr would go to such lengths to investigate a relatively
minor player like Ms. Steele struck some lawyers as illustrative of
what Starr's critics call his overzealous approach, although
several former prosecutors said such questioning of former
associates and relatives was routine.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Bakaly III, a spokesman for the independent counsel's
office, said, ``We cannot comment on the grand jury investigation
and neither confirm nor discuss particular witnesses nor the course
of the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   During a four-hour interview, Ms. Steele described her
intensifying problems, frequently referring to six color-coded
notebooks that contain documents relating to her case. She has
nicknamed the notebooks ``Pandora,'' and said they illustrated how
Starr's investigation had taken over her life.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele described the last year as ``a thoroughly despicable
experience'' because of the investigation. During her last job
earlier this year, as a part-time employee for a small
communications company, Ms. Steele said she was told not to use her
last name when she made customer calls. ``I've always been proud of
my name,'' she lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele's lawyer, Nancy Luque, who has been representing Ms.
Steele on a pro bono basis since March, said Starr's investigators
had been asking questions about the adoption arrangements for Ms.
Steele's son.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have also been examining Ms. Steele's finances.
Ms. Steele said she was aware of rumors that she was paid to
challenge Ms. Willey's story, and rumors that she was being
threatened with a disclosure suggesting that her son's adoption was
illegal. Ms. Steele said there was no truth to any of this.
</P>
<P>
   She said that she had received no financial inducements for her
testimony and that she legalized the adoption of her son in both
Romania and the United States. Ms. Steele said she had no
association with the White House and did not even vote for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She conceded that it was wrong of her to lie for Ms. Willey and
to sell a photograph of Ms. Willey and Clinton to The National
Enquirer for $7,000. But Ms. Steele said Starr's dogged pursuit of
her was ``invasive and scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Her problems began in March 1997, Ms. Steele said, when Ms.
Willey, who had been her close friend in Richmond since the late
1970s, asked her to speak with a Newsweek reporter, Michael
Isikoff. Isikoff was pursuing an article about a possible encounter
between Ms. Willey and Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele said Ms. Willey called her and begged her to tell
Isikoff, who was on his way to Ms. Steele's house, that the
president had groped her. She said that Ms. Willey wanted her to
say that she was so upset about the encounter that she told Ms.
Steele about it the night it happened, four years earlier. Ms.
Steele now says none of that was true. She said she had lied for
Ms. Willey about other relationships and agreed to again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would get into print or become the
god-awful thing it's become,'' Ms. Steele said. Ms. Luque, her
lawyer, added, ``Julie wouldn't minimize the stupidity of lying to
Michael Isikoff, but she never imagined in her wildest dreams that
all of this would be visited on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Five months later, as Isikoff was proceeding with an article
about the Willey matter, Ms. Steele recanted. Isikoff reported Ms.
Steele's initial account and her recantation in his Newsweek
article.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Ms. Steele was drawn into the Jones case when one of
Clinton's lawyers called her and asked if she would provide an
affidavit stating that Ms. Willey had asked her to lie. Ms. Steele
agreed. She said she felt she had hurt the president by lying to
Isikoff and felt obliged to correct the record.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in March, two FBI agents from Starr's office appeared at
her door. ``I didn't think they believed me,'' she recalled. ``They
wanted to believe Kathleen.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, she was subpoenaed to appear before Starr's grand jury
in Washington. After being questioned for almost a day, Ms. Steele
told reporters that she had made a mistake, and that as a result,
``my good name has been damaged, my health has deteriorated, I have
had to hide myself and my child from the news media in my driveway,
and I have been called here today.'' She said she had testified
truthfully and added, ``Hopefully, this ends my involvement in the
matter.''
</P>
<P>
   That was not to be. She was subpoenaed again. In August, Ms.
Steele's lawyer, Ms. Luque, received a letter from one of Starr's
deputies, David Barger, informing her that Ms. Steele's status in
the investigation had changed, from witness to subject.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Ms. Steele became more aggressive. She filed a
breach-of-contract lawsuit against Isikoff and Newsweek, charging
that they had violated a promise that Ms. Steele's interviews with
the reporter were off the record, a contention the magazine denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her claim is pure fantasy,'' said Newsweek's Washington bureau
chief, Ann McDaniel. Ms. Steele also appeared on the ``Larry King
Live'' show with her lawyer in the Newsweek suit, John Coale, who
complained that she was being ``bullied'' by Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele's more defiant posture did little to dampen Starr's
interest in her. ``They were now out to discredit her,'' said Ms.
Luque, who was concerned that Ms. Steele might be charged with
perjury if any of her answers during her second grand-jury
appearance conflicted with her earlier testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Luque insisted that her client cite her Fifth Amendment
rights against self-incrimination, advice that Ms. Steele said she
followed. On Sept. 23, she agreed to take a lie-detector test,
which both Ms. Luque and Ms. Steele said she passed.
</P>
<P>
   Since Ms. Steele's second grand-jury appearance, her brother,
daughter and former lawyer were subpoenaed. On Thursday, her
daughter, Liza Steele, was questioned for six hours before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   It remains unclear whether Starr will charge Ms. Steele, but he
has collected evidence that she told at least one other person that
Ms. Willey had told her she was groped by the president. Bill
Poveromo, a one-time friend of Ms. Steele, said in an interview
that at dinner in 1997, Ms. Steele told him that Ms. Willey was
``flattered'' by the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Poveromo was subpoenaed and testified before the grand jury in
Alexandria in July. Last week, a representative from Starr's office
questioned Poveromo's boss at a Richmond television station. Ms.
Luque said Ms. Steele did not recall discussing the matter with
Poveromo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Steele's version of events is only one of several accounts
of the Willey matter. There is Ms. Willey's accusation of a pass
and the president's absolute denial. There are the accounts of two
friends of Ms. Willey, Linda Tripp and Harolyn Cardozo, who have
both said that Ms. Willey was happy about a pass she described from
the president.
</P>
<P>
   As for their one-time close friendship, Ms. Steele and Ms.
Willey no longer speak. Months ago, they had an angry encounter at
a market in Richmond. Of all her mistakes, Ms. Steele said,
believing that Ms. Willey was her friend was the biggest.

NEW MEXICO: KIND WORD FOR GREENS FROM REPUBLICANS  
 WISCONSIN: AND THEY LIKE THOSE DEMOCRATS, TOO  
 WISCONSIN: THOMPSON ISN'T SHY ABOUT AMBITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it ``reverse English'' political advertising, or some such.
Whatever it is, it is a different kind of spin that is being used
in the congressional campaign in New Mexico's 3rd District.
</P>
<P>
   The state Republican Party has sent out mailers in that contest
that do more than pump up its candidate, Rep. Bill Redmond. They
also pump up the Green Party candidate, Carol Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Say what?
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders figure that Ms. Miller has no realistic shot
at taking away the seat from Redmond, a political conservative. But
they well remember that last year, when Redmond first won the seat
in a special election, narrowly, he did so mainly because Ms.
Miller, who also ran in that race, siphoned off thousands of votes
from the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Now they're trying to make that happen again, offering some kind
words for Ms. Miller and her Green Party environmental ideology,
and then slamming the environmental record of the Democratic
candidate, Attorney General Tom Udall.
</P>
<P>
   It is the same tactic the New Mexico GOP used in 1997. With the
help of some Republican advertising in that race, Ms. Miller came
away with 17 percent of the vote and Redmond slipped by the
Democrat, Eric Serna. ``Carol Miller is our best friend,''said John
Dendahl, the state Republican chairman.
</P>
<P>
   AND THEY LIKE THOSE DEMOCRATS, TOO
</P>
<P>
   There is a different kind of spin on the advertising in the
Wisconsin Senate race, too, a race that has already taken more than
one curious turn.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee tried to run
some ads to help the party's hard-pressed candidate, Sen. Russell
Feingold, an uncompromising political liberal. He promptly bit the
hand that was feeding him, calling the ads ``lousy,'' and saying
that as a leading proponent of campaign-finance reform, he could
not accept such outside money, even though it might cost him
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Comes now the Republican Senatorial Committee with an ad on
behalf of Feingold's challenger, Rep. Mark Neumann, a conservative.
He'll take all the outside help he can get, even an ad that pumps
up Herb Kohl, Wisconsin's other Democratic senator.
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt:
</P>
<P>
   ``Our moderate senator, Herb Kohl, tried to make it a crime to
carry a gun in a school zone. Russ Feingold voted no. Mandatory,
tough prison sentences for drug dealers who exploit kids _ Kohl
voted yes. Feingold voted no.''
</P>
<P>
   Feingold figures the way to fight Kohl is with Kohl. His latest
ad features Kohl saying:
</P>
<P>
   ``Russ Feingold is a man of great character. We've worked side
by side to eliminate the budget deficit, reduce crime and protect
Social Security. Russ Feingold does more than just talk about
cleaning up politics. He's making it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   THOMPSON ISN'T SHY ABOUT AMBITION
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin comes right out
and says it. No subtlety. No beating around the bush.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to be president. Or vice president. Either one.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking the other day to the Madison Rotary Club, Thompson, a
Republican and champion talker, toyed with the possibility of
running for higher office, like a cat with a ball of yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he said, he would like to run for president in 2000. But
no, he added, he would not.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   It would take at least $25 million just to get started, he said,
and that was more than he could raise. Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the oft-mentioned possible Republican presidential
candidate, could easily raise that much, Thompson went on, and the
pity of that, he lamented, was that Tommy Thompson would be ``as
good, if not better'' as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's appearance before the Rotarians was ostensibly to
campaign for votes for a record fourth term. But his political
heart and ego were in his talk of higher office, and he apparently
figured he could get away with it, since polls have him running
ahead of his Democratic challenger, Ed Garvey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said, ``if somebody asked me to be their running
mate, I think everybody in this room would say I'd be crazy not to
consider it. I will consider it. I think it absolutely is a
compliment to the state of Wisconsin that somebody has the
opportunity to be considered to run for president of the United
States, or be considered as the candidate for vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Garvey later said that all he could think about was Tuesday's
gubernatorial race.

   MAYFIELD HEIGHTS, Ohio _ Even though Joseph Tomaro is the last,
defiant holdout in a rural neighborhood gone urban, he enjoys the
serendipitous camaraderie that commercialism brings his way. He
knows the names of the office workers who walk by his house and
swaps news with the merchants down the street.
</P>
<P>
   He is even friendly with the construction workers building the
final insult: a four-level parking garage, looming just 10 feet
south of his house and garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, those fellows thought I wanted to make trouble for
them,'' said Tomaro, 83, a retired machinist and union leader who
has lived in this Cleveland suburb since 1950. ``But I went over on
their lunch break and told them, `Don't get me wrong _ I'm all for
the working man.' Now we talk all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomaro saves his ire for the city officials who allowed Meridia
Hillcrest Hospital to build its new garage so close to both his
property and the street. The hospital has been trying to buy his
property for the last 30 years. After he declined yet another offer
this year, Hillcrest began extending its parking around his
property, which is 50 feet by 190 feet. The new garage will
intersect another garage and valet parking lot, which lie 30 feet
east of his back yard.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of several planning and zoning disputes, Tomaro has
attended nearly every city meeting since he moved to Mayfield
Heights, which has a population of almost 20,000. ``Sometimes I'm
the only citizen there,'' he said. ``They ask me, `Don't you have
anything to do?' I tell them I got plenty to do, but I still want
to know how you guys are running my city.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Margaret Egensperger disputes Tomaro's accusations that
the city made any zoning concessions to the hospital, saying the
new garage met all existing code. But she is unwilling to criticize
his recalcitrance in the face of growing pains by one of the city's
biggest employers. ``This is democracy at its finest,'' she said.
``He's held out, and I would go to war to defend his right to do
so. He loves his place and doesn't care how much money they offer
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Miner, Meridia Health Systems chief executive, has
visited Tomaro a few times at his home, sitting at the kitchen
table to talk about the impasse. ``We still want the property, but
we're fine with him staying where he is,'' Miner said. ``We try to
be the best neighbor we can. It's just that it's not a residential
neighborhood anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Tomaro's two-bedroom brick bungalow is near one of the
busiest intersections in Cleveland's eastern suburbs. He chose to
build there in 1949 because it was the terminus for city water and
sewage; his wife, who died in 1982, put down her foot at the idea
of moving any farther out of the city. Now, his beloved country
lane is a fast lane, with two bustling shopping centers nearby and
commuters clotting the roads. He wakes to the sound of car alarms
and horns reverberating through the hospital's cavernous garage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has no plans to leave. ``I'd go crazy in an
apartment,'' he said, his blue eyes shaded green by the reflected
light of his garden and Seabee cap. ``I'm not a senior citizen yet.
I'm too pressed for time.''
</P>
<P>
   For 48 years, Tomaro has been working a large plot in his back
yard, turning clay and stones into soil he can spade as easily as
one scoops coffee. He has already finished one round of rototilling
this fall and sown his crop of winter rye. Inside his refrigerator
are jars of the seeds he preserves from year to year, including the
basil his father brought from Italy in 1914; the Sicilian blackjack
zucchini, which grows as large as a sturdy young leg; and the
Brooklyn Bomber tomato, one of which weighed 3 3/4 pounds last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Every summer, Tomaro puts up a table on his front lawn and sells
his produce, more for the company than the profits. He gets a lot
of dawdlers from the areas' many buildings for the elderly, who
miss their own gardens and like the opportunity of poking around
his.
</P>
<P>
   But they cannot call ahead to find out whether their favorite
vegetable is ready for picking. Tomaro has had an unlisted number
ever since his wife received obscene phone calls during a strike he
led in the 1940s. Now, others with his surname pull up in his yard
to complain about late-night callers who try to find him by calling
every Tomaro in the telephone book.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell me, `Get listed, Joe _ I get people calling me all
hours of the day and night asking about tomatoes,''' Tomaro grins
and fingers the collar of his shirt. ``Now why would I want to put
up with that?''
</P>

FOR FURYK, CONSISTENCY FINALLY STARTS TO PAY OFF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Not long ago, people were asking Jim Furyk why he had
not won in more than two years. This weekend, Furyk is threatening
to win for the second time in less than a month.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the momentum of last month's victory at the Las Vegas
Invitational, Furyk started Saturday's third round of the Tour
Championship in second place at 5 under par (135), two strokes
behind Vijay Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Through two rounds at East Lake Golf Club, a course that is
among the most difficult the players have seen this year, Furyk was
the only competitor with two rounds in the 60s (67-68). And during
Friday's second round, Furyk was the only player without a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   That type of consistency has been Furyk's trademark, but for
several years he was not rewarded with victories. After winning the
1995 Las Vegas Invitational and the 1996 United Airlines Hawaiian
Open, Furyk sustained a long drought for a player of his caliber.
Before last month's victory, Furyk had 23 top-10 finishes without a
winner's check since the start of 1997. The paychecks were good.
But the frustration was growing.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed last month, when Furyk held off Mark
Calcavecchia to win Las Vegas by one stroke. And now that Furyk has
tasted victory, he is even more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scoring pretty well right now, and I'm finding a way to
get the ball in the hole,'' said Furyk, who will be paired with
Singh in Saturday's final twosome. ``In Vegas, it seemed like I
saved up all my birdies from the last month and used them. It's
nice to come back off that tournament and tee it up thinking that
the last time I played, I won.''
</P>
<P>
   Furyk hopes that winning does the same thing for him that it did
for David Duval. After seven second-place finishes without a
victory, Duval finally broke through at last year's Michelob
Championship, and Duval has gone on to win seven times during the
last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Duval hopes to clinch the 1998 money title this weekend, but
Furyk still could beat him. If Duval finishes 24th or higher this
weekend, he will win the money title. But if Furyk wins, and Duval
finishes lower than 24th, Furyk would win the money title.
</P>
<P>
   With Duval starting Saturday's round tied for 19th place,
Furyk's chances for the money crown were still slim. With more than
$1.82 million won this year, Furyk had an excellent chance to cross
the $2 million mark, and he will easily cross it by winning this
$720,000 first-place check.
</P>
<P>
   While some players were grumbling about the difficulty of East
Lake, Furyk was not among them. His accuracy, steady putting and
ability to save par from difficult positions had kept him in
contention, while others were faltering.
</P>
<P>
   ``These greens are rivaling Augusta and Oakmont for the toughest
I've played,'' Furyk said. ``They don't want scores where you're
shooting 20 under to win the Tour Championship. It's fitting for
the last tournament of the year. I think you get rewarded for good
shots here, and I don't think the course is unfair. The greens are
rolling pretty true, and you can make some birdies. But it's
definitely in the top five of difficulty. This golf course stands
up with the courses where we played majors this year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Furyk has become one of the game's elite
players, a member of last year's U.S. Ryder Cup team, and a member
of this year's President's Cup team that will compete in Australia
in December. The one weakness in Furyk's resume is the lack of a
major title, although he was in contention this year at both the
Masters and the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Masters hurt more for some reason _ I think just being on
the 18th green and having a putt to tie,'' Furyk said. ``The
British Open just ticked me off more than anything. I know I hit
the ball as well as anyone that week, maybe better than anyone
else. I didn't make some of the putts coming down the stretch. It
wasn't meant to be.''
</P>
<P>
   But this weekend, Furyk found himself in contention again. And
having been there so many times, he knew how to handle himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't worry about watching the scoreboard on Friday,'' he
said. ``I'm a scoreboard watcher, but on Friday there's really no
point to it. But the main thing is that I'm in good shape for the
weekend. I'm definitely happy.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FOR NBA UNION, WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, the same pro basketball superstars who are
currently negotiating a luxury tax with David Stern tried to
decertify their union after learning their representatives were
negotiating a luxury tax with David Stern.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing subverted
Simon Gourdine's and Buck Williams' leadership while contesting the
very collective bargaining agreement they wish they could now
preserve. Now Jordan and Ewing are discovering how much harder it
is to run the government than to stage a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become obvious now that, except for not raising the
minimum salary more, the 1995 deal was an excellent one for the
players,'' Williams said from his Greenwich, Conn., home. ``I'm not
looking to say, `I told you so.' I'm not that kind of person. But
it's gratifying to hear some of them say, `Let's get back to the
status quo.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, what Williams wants to hear is that the locked-out
players are getting closer to an equitable deal that would allow
him to proceed with the final season of an 18-year National
Basketball Association career, possibly not with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   He roots for an agreement before too many games are lost and too
many players are desperate and Billy Hunter, a tough, earnest man
he admires, finds himself back on defense, trying to cover his
players, not to mention the owners and Stern, the NBA commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   This would be most unfortunate, said Williams, in a league that
is 80 percent black and more than ever needs a strong players'
advocate, a voice and ego equal in stature to Stern's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy was hired because he is competent and intelligent,''
Williams said. ``He also happens to be black, and I think, even if
you just look at the history of our own union, black leadership is
held to a higher standard. You see it all the time; blacks don't
believe that another black man can do for them what a white man
can. Race is an issue, a subtext, in this fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Winning the fight is one thing; losing perspective is another.
This is the fine line Hunter walks. Three years ago, Williams
couldn't collect dues, much less get players like Jordan and Ewing
to stop counting their money and shoot for the union. Now Jordan
engages in shouting matches with owners, and only he knows how much
of this has been inspired by his ubiquitous agent, David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael and Patrick didn't care until Falk told them to get
involved,'' Williams said. ``But Billy has done a great job
insulating himself with some really big megastars.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter won't be immune to what befell Williams, Gourdine and
Charles Grantham before them if this goes on much longer. The
modern pro basketball player has never ridden fume-filled buses in
the minor leagues, or plugged his way through the frozen tundra of
junior hockey.
</P>
<P>
   He holds poolside news conferences and doesn't recognize the
public-relations folly of holding a rank-and-file meeting in Las
Vegas. Hunter has to play his cards so that he doesn't put his
less-leveraged players in the cash-strapped position to panic,
while Stern pontificates and the NBA continues to be perceived as a
one-genius league.
</P>
<P>
   It has been this way since Larry Fleisher ran a tight union
ship, in no small part because he doubled as the agent for the
league's activist players. Isiah Thomas emerged a decade ago to
contest this arrangement, and the union has since been a mix of
apathy and anarchy, which only inspires Falk to, as he says, ``roll
up his sleeves'' for players at the top end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all perception,'' said Williams, remembering how easy it
was for Falk to ridicule the 1995 deal that drove the players'
percentage of the pie from 52 percent to 57 percent. ``But the
result has always been all these white attorneys on both sides, and
in the middle you have black players questioning the intelligence
of their black union leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Jordan and Ewing stepped in to block the first
version of the 1995 deal until the luxury tax was removed, Falk and
other agents promoted decertifying the union, ultimately losing a
vote that was more lopsided than the worst NBA blowout.
</P>
<P>
   When Stern locked the players out last July, everyone knew the
owners hadn't exercised their contractual right to reopen
negotiations over pennies. This union had all summer to explore
what it preached last time _ decertification _ and didn't. Hunter
knows his consensus is less interested in chasing lawyer-driven
dreams in court, more determined to cut a deal and get paid.
</P>
<P>
   So a milder version of the luxury tax that supposedly meant
Armageddon in 1995 went on the table. Hunter said on the radio the
other day that he has offered to roll back unrestricted free agency
for rookies, following their first contracts, to
right-of-first-refusal free agency. Owners would get leverage they
should have when dealing with players who demand $100 million for
potential, not production.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tough one to give back,'' Williams said. Again, three
years ago, he was hammered by Falk for simply allowing a rookie
wage scale. Ask Kevin Garnett how that agreement worked out. Ask
Alonzo Mourning and Allan Houston and, of course, Ewing if Buck
Williams' deal was so bad.
</P>
<P>
   As Williams said, this is always about point of view, about
power, about who gets the biggest payday. Billy Hunter has a chance
to alter the perception of who represents all the players, who
drives the NBA with Stern. Hunter's window of opportunity is now,
or maybe never. &QL;

A TIRELESS MRS. CLINTON FINDS HER DEMOCRATIC DANCE CARD FULL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Iowa, Minn.)  (js) 
 By PAM BELLUCK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The floor-to-rafters crowd at the Democrats' Get Out
the Vote rally was already in a buoyant mood, having heard a
rousing rendition of ``Lift Every Voice and Sing'' and the Stevie
Wonder tune ``Living for the City.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, the stars in the black Democratic pantheon took the
stage to rouse the largely black audience that had packed the
white-columned headquarters of the Rev. Jesse Jackson's
Rainbow/PUSH Coalition on the South Side of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing could compare with the applause that exploded
throughout the hall when Hillary Rodham Clinton grabbed the
microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Run for office,'' called Theresa Jackson, who was standing in
the aisle, trying to find empty seats for latecomers. ``She needs
to run for office.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is undeniably the Democrats' ace in the hole this
election and she has kept up a frenetic pace the last several weeks
as party leaders in states across the country hope her magical
appeal will rub off on Democrats running for office.
</P>
<P>
   She has appeared in nearly 20 states in recent days and on
Saturday alone was scheduled to appear at three events in Chicago
before flying to Minnesota and then to Iowa to stump for the
Democratic candidates for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Her aides say she is doing roughly twice as many campaign
appearances as she did in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a huge help to have her,'' said Kitty Kurth, a
Chicago Democratic political consultant who helped arrange Mrs.
Clinton's appearances Saturday. Scanning the more than 2,500 people
who had come to see the first lady, she said, ``This is more energy
than I've seen in the black community in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   People say they respond to Mrs. Clinton because she seems warm
and sincere, committed to bedrock Democratic issues like child care
and Social Security and because, in the wake of the seamy
revelations about President Clinton's sexual transgressions, she
has handled herself with poise, dignity and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Mrs. Clinton, Jackson summarized the reaction of
many in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is something about your style, about your grace, about
your strength, about your motherness, about your wifeness, about
your maturity, about your patriotism, about your strength of
reasoning,'' Jackson said. ``Hillary, you've walked through rain
and you're not wet. You've walked through fire and there's not a
singe on your clothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton energetically ran down the list of the Democratic
candidates for all the county and state offices, giving an explicit
plug for Glenn Poshard, the congressman who is trailing in the race
for governor.
</P>
<P>
   But she saved her most enthusiastic exhortations by far for
Carol Moseley-Braun, who in a stunning upset six years ago was
elected to the U.S. Senate _ the only black woman to hold that
office _ but has been dogged by a series of political and personal
misjudgments and is running well behind in the polls.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's appropriate that we're doing this on Halloween because
Carol's opponent has been masquerading as a moderate throughout
this campaign,'' Mrs. Clinton said in a speech that never mentioned
the name of the Republican senatorial candidate, state Sen. Peter
Fitzgerald, a conservative millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Senate election is too serious to be left to the business
of trick or treat.'' She added, ``It's up to you to unmask him
before Election Day.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd was primed to close ranks behind Ms. Moseley-Braun,
considered one of the most vulnerable of incumbent senators.
Outside, a loudspeaker was blaring a newly minted theme song
designed to rev up Ms. Moseley-Braun's black support by invoking
the name of Harold Washington, Chicago's first black mayor. ``We
did it for Harold,'' the song proclaimed. ``We can do it for
Carol.''
</P>
<P>
   But some had clearly come mostly to see Mrs. Clinton speak for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her. I love the first lady,'' said Linda Yeo, a legal
secretary who had traveled from Chicago's far North Side. ``The
strength that she has and the dignity. She reminds us of
ourselves.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A GREAT CAREER STAINED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of understanding who and what he is now, Lawrence Taylor
thinks of himself too often as what he was.
</P>
<P>
   He still refers to himself as ``L.T.,'' as if he were still
wearing a Giants jersey with No. 56 on it, as if he were about to
put on his blue helmet for the Giants' game with the Redskins, as
if he were still compiling his resume for Pro Football's Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his Giants career, the Hall of Fame, in Canton, Ohio,
inspired him.
</P>
<P>
   In his early years, he would ask, ``Am I good enough to make
it?'' In his later years, he wondered, ``Will I make it my first
year of eligibility?''
</P>
<P>
   But that was when he was L.T., the outside linebacker who
defined that position.
</P>
<P>
   What Lawrence Taylor hasn't learned, or doesn't want to learn,
is that as soon as he took off his Giants uniform for the last time
after the 1993 season, L.T. ceased to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Taylor is just Lawrence Taylor now, a person instead of
a player; a person whose image keeps staining all that he
accomplished as a player.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Taylor has found life tougher than anybody who tried to
block L.T.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to avert foreclosure on his home in Upper Saddle River,
N.J., where he is reportedly $350,000 in arrears in mortgage
payments and other fees, Lawrence Taylor, not L.T., declared
Chapter 7 bankruptcy Thursday, four days after he entered an
unidentified drug rehabilitation clinic in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, Lawrence Taylor, not L.T., was arrested in St.
Petersburg Beach, Fla., on crack-cocaine charges; in May 1996 he
was arrested in Myrtle Beach, S.C., on similar charges.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lawrence Taylor, not L.T., pleaded guilty in U.S.
District Court in Camden, N.J., to filing a false federal income
tax return; he failed to report $48,000 in income from a
now-shuttered New Jersey restaurant and sports bar known as
``LT's.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1993, he has been questioned by a state grand jury
investigating organized crime, had his driver's license suspended
because of outstanding parking tickets, and received three traffic
summonses for leaving the scene of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   But on the same day that Lawrence Taylor the person declared
bankruptcy, the ghost of L.T. the linebacker appeared. In his first
year of eligibility for the Hall of Fame, he was listed among 76
candidates up for election on Jan. 30, five days before his 40th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Arguably as good a football player as anybody already bronzed in
Canton, he deserves to be a virtual unanimous choice of the 36
selectors. And maybe he will be.
</P>
<P>
   If I had a vote, he'd get it. And he'll get plenty of votes. But
will he get enough votes? His drug-related image is sure to
influence some selectors not to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 75 candidates on the preliminary ballot, Taylor must
finish among the top 15 vote-getters to qualify for consideration
in the selection meeting on Jan. 30 in Miami. After being discussed
in the selection meeting, he would need the support of at least 80
percent of the 36 selectors, or 29 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Taylor has been asked how his image might influence his
candidacy, he has said, ``Why should how I live my life make any
difference?'' It shouldn't. His football skills should be the
determining factor. But not every voter will think that way.
</P>
<P>
   Even before his recent arrests, he will be the first Hall of
Fame candidate with a drug-related asterisk on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   During his Giants career he acknowledged entering a rehab center
after the 1985 season. He was suspended for four games at the start
of the 1988 season for violating the National Football League's
substance-abuse policy, reportedly for using cocaine. And now that
he's in rehab again, he could be in Hall of Fame purgatory.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hornung had to endure that purgatory for his 1964
suspension for gambling on pro football. After losing out by only
six votes in 1979 and five in 1980, he finally was elected in 1986,
two decades after his final season as a Packers' running back.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, Fran Tarkenton, who then held all the NFL career
passing records, was turned down, 17-12, in his first year of
eligibility, when there were fewer voters; he didn't make it until
his third year. Joe Namath was spurned, 17-11, in his first year
and 21-8 in his second before being elected his third time around.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Taylor did or did not do in St. Petersburg Beach will
emerge in court, but even his innocence wouldn't really change his
image for the voters, one for each of the 30 franchises plus
at-large selectors.
</P>
<P>
   No more than six candidates (plus the Oldtimers Committee
candidate, the former Bills guard Billy Shaw this year) can be
elected in any one year, along with a minimum of four. As
final-ballot names who didn't quite make it early this year, Dan
Rooney, the Steelers' president, and Ozzie Newsome, the former
Browns tight end, are assured of being among the 15 finalists.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those who have been finalists in recent years,
such as Lynn Swann and Jack Youngblood, the list includes several
worthy first-year names: Marv Levy, Phil Simms, Eric Dickerson,
Howie Long, Joe Jacoby, Roger Craig and Mark Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Unanimous choices are rare at Canton. In the decade before the
results of the voting began to be tabulated secretly by an
accounting firm in 1985, the only unanimous choices were the
quarterback Johnny Unitas, the middle linebacker Dick Butkus, the
running back Gale Sayers and the cornerback Dick (Night Train)
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   L.T. had a chance to be unanimous, too, but Lawrence Taylor kept
staining the image.

EDITORIAL: THE IMPEACHMENT BREATHER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 1:
</P>
<P>
   Until a few days ago, the possible impeachment of President
Clinton was the campaign issue of which few dared speak.
Republicans have been afraid to be seen exploiting the subject.
Democratic candidates did not want to be seen defending the
president or even standing near him, except in a few party
strongholds. Both parties seemed to believe that voters wanted a
respite from the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Republicans have injected the issue into several
races, and Democrats have responded with ads calling for Congress
to move on. There is some logic to putting Clinton back on the
agenda. The 106th Congress, after all, will have no more urgent
priority than deciding his fate.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans designed the ads to energize their core vote in
selected districts without stirring a backlash among the Democrats
and independents they want to stay home. If the strategy helps
produce a Republican gain greater than 20 seats, the hunkered-down
Republican leadership will take that as a signal to push hard on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say that if they can hold the losses to 10 or so
seats, Republicans will want House Speaker Newt Gingrich to resolve
impeachment proceedings quickly, with a censure, before the State
of the Union message in January.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported that Gingrich personally approved
the last-minute commercials about the president's affair with
Monica Lewinsky, and the speaker is under enormous pressure to
prove to congressional Republicans that he has not overplayed their
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Although Democrats are tormented by turnout worries and
intramural squabbles about how to finance their congressional
candidates, the party and Clinton's standing are not the shambles
they might have been.
</P>
<P>
   Two and a half months ago, just after the president's grand jury
appearance and his sullen television performance that evening, many
Democratic lawmakers were hoping privately that he would resign to
spare them what they feared would be a historic debacle at the
polls in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clinton's approval ratings are as high as ever, and he
scored political victories on the budget, the Middle East peace
agreement and an apparent withdrawal of Serbian forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Few speak any longer of a president unable to get things done at
home or abroad. But the Democrats in Washington also know that
there is little enthusiasm for this president, even among his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone remembers that in the 1974 election just after
Watergate, the huge Democratic gains occurred less because of a
swing among voters than a massive trend of Republican voters
staying home. Moreover, the polls according Clinton high ratings
for his job performance also show strong disapproval of his
personal character.
</P>
<P>
   Except for New York and California, Clinton has been careful
this campaign not to barnstorm the country for himself or the
Democrats (though there have been plenty of fund-raisers). Ever the
campaigner, Clinton is said to be chafing at his advisers'
restrictions, but they believe the happy-warrior conduct would not
be seen as consistent with his ``journey of atonement.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of a full debate about impeachment is not the only
example of a detached and unsatisfying campaign, divorced from the
issues. The candidates exchanged platitudes about abortion, gun
control, adding teachers and enacting a patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   The next Congress will have to deal with nothing less than
shoring up the global economy and devising a plan to save Social
Security in the next generation, and to get to these issues,
impeachment will have to be dealt with. The Republicans' own mixed
feelings about engaging the issue on the campaign trail should tell
them that the public wants the issue resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Clinton's own bunkered existence should tell him that
he should not try to tough it out, even if the Democrats perform
respectably in the election. A move by Clinton to admit lying under
oath, combined with a censure by Congress, is still the best way
out of the presidential crisis. Through the poll numbers, that
seems to be what the voters are saying as well.
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton and Gingrich, they will be looking at another set
of numbers _ their parties' gains or losses in Congress _ to decide
whether to go to war or sue for peace.

IF THERE'S DRAMA, JORDAN IS IN MIDDLE
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At what moment the season had a decent chance of being salvaged,
no one can be sure. But when word got out that a stretch black
limousine parked outside a Manhattan law firm late Wednesday night
was idling until 1 a.m. for Michael Jordan, any wild scenario
seemed possible.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan could not merely be negotiating and trying to help end
the National Basketball Association's labor dispute by perusing
through proposals. That was too reasonable. He had to be going
one-on-one with another boardroom superstar, looking David Stern in
the eye for everything in the $2 billion kitty.
</P>
<P>
   Given his affinity for drama, he had most likely engaged the NBA
commissioner in a heart-to-heart chat about how much the game means
to both of them. Remembering that he never comes to New York to
lose, Jordan would then come out of an eight-hour bargaining
session having rescued the game from greed. Maybe he would even
commit to playing one more season.
</P>
<P>
   Because not all of what he does is out of this world, it did not
happen that way. The game's greatest player emerged with a
half-smile and said both sides had some great dialogue even though
they were still far apart from a deal.
</P>
<P>
   But his presence in the labor war between the owners and the
players is enough to raise speculation that he wants to play again,
and maybe that is enough for imagination to overcome reason.
</P>
<P>
   He says he is doing his union duty, like Oscar Robertson and
Julius Erving before him. Yet, you get the sense Jordan also misses
the NBA spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when we get this thing settled, we can expect Michael
to come back,'' Billy Hunter, the union executive director, said
last week. ``Michael hasn't said that, but I'm prepared to predict
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not a done deal. With so much uncertainty surrounding the
Bulls _ whether Scottie Pippen and the supporting cast will all
sign and how to find a replacement for Dennis Rodman are key _ who
knows what Jordan is thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he wants to play,'' said David Falk, his agent. ``But
it's the equivalent of someone being offered employment and not
knowing anything about the work. Right now, there are too many
uncertainties for him to make his decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Clarity make come sooner than later. The first step is figuring
out an economic system that will run into the next millennium.
Whatever deal is struck _ both sides are expected to meet this week
in Manhattan amid hope that an agreement in principle can be
resolved by the following week _ will include grandfather clauses
to enable Jordan to play for almost any amount he chooses.
</P>
<P>
   The next step will involve either the rebuilding or the
reloading of the Bulls. If Jordan does not think Chicago has a shot
at winning a title with whatever assembled cast General Manager
Jerry Krause puts together, he may decide a second-round playoff
exit is not worth the anguish.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, each game lost this season is, by
association, another game stricken from Jordan's scintillating
career.
</P>
<P>
   That fact alone cannot be lost on negotiations between both
sides. NBC's new contract with the NBA is scheduled to begin with
the Knicks and Bulls on Christmas Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael deciding to play again would be an enormous topping on
the cake, but there are 400 other hundred players who aren't
earning their $1 billion-plus in salaries and owners who are not
seeing ticket revenue,'' Stern said. ``So if we could tie up the
package in a bow, well, that would be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing, the union president, asked Jordan to take a more
proactive role in negotiations last week. Putting his on-court
rivalry with Jordan aside, Ewing essentially enlisted the help of
the man who has had more to do with keeping him from championship
immortality in New York than perhaps anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing, the guy who has done the grunt work for months with
Hunter, gave back the stage again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be in the forefront,'' Jordan said before he
sped away in his limousine down a rainy street. ``They wanted me
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordan may not have been any more instrumental in trying to hash
out a deal than the next player. But something about his sitting in
a conference room late Wednesday night with the future of the
league at stake seems good and right.
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like his coming back. &QL;

EDITORIAL: SOUTH AFRICA'S STINGING TRUTHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Sunday, Nov. 1:
</P>
<P>
   The 3,500-page report of the South African Truth and
Reconciliation Commission, released on Thursday, is the most
comprehensive and unsparing examination of a nation's ugly past
that any such commission has yet produced.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from the commission's own investigations and the
testimony of hundreds of applicants for amnesty and 20,000 victims,
the report is a detailed look at the crimes of the apartheid era,
and blames successive white governments for the vast majority.
</P>
<P>
   It has fulfilled its mandate of telling the fullest truth
possible, which is one reason that every political party in South
Africa has denounced it.
</P>
<P>
   Besides accusing the government of assassinations and bombings,
the report criticizes the Inkatha Freedom Party for its massacres
and collaboration with security forces, and blames the African
National Congress for the murder of civilians and other crimes. It
singles out former President P.W. Botha, Chief Mangosuthu
Buthelezi, the Inkatha leader, and Winnie Mandela, among others,
for detailed treatment of their roles in political crimes.
</P>
<P>
   One major flaw in the report is the absence of a section
accusing F.W. de Klerk, the last apartheid president, of knowing
about several bombings after the fact and keeping silent. It was
excised because de Klerk is suing the commission. The ANC also
sued, unsuccessfully, to stop publication.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits are a disappointing sign that South Africa's
political parties are not interested in an honest look at their
past, nor in the free flow of information.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has added to widespread complaints that the
commission has not helped the process of reconciliation. This is
wrong. True reconciliation _ which occurs when a society is no
longer paralyzed by the past and people can work and live together
_ cannot be based on silence. No society can be restored to health
by papering over as much pain as South Africans have suffered. A
noisy and informed debate about complicity in the crimes of the
apartheid era is necessary, if uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The report is only part of the Truth Commission's contribution
to the healing process.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings themselves, which allowed victims of human rights
violations to tell their stories in public, helped the country heal
and opened the eyes of many whites to the unpleasant truth about
apartheid.
</P>
<P>
   The amnesty process, while permitting many important criminals
to escape justice, is allowing families to know exactly what
happened to their loved ones in dozens of cases that would likely
have never gone to trial in South Africa's fragile judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   The process of helping the victims with scholarships and other
necessary aid goes on, although it will not be enough. No
commission can transform a society as twisted as South Africa's
was. But the Truth Commission is the best effort the world has
seen, and South Africa is the better for it.

 &HT;    Red Cross scientists close in on faster ways to stop the
bleeding that can kill trauma victims
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILEE, Md. _ Help! The pot roast is bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Call the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gunshot, Dawson Beall deftly deduces. He picks up a
silver canister, shoots white powder into the wound, then adds a
squirt of water. In seconds, the roast erupts with white foam, like
a second-grader's volcano science project.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding stops.
</P>
<P>
   Another pot roast is saved.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the laboratories of the American Red Cross, where
tomorrow's lifesaving techniques are perfected today on pigs, pot
roasts and other props.
</P>
<P>
   Inventions and innovations to help trauma victims are just some
of the ongoing research projects under way at the Jerome H. Holland
Laboratory for the Biomedical Sciences. The unpretentious two-floor
building is full of the usual quirky clutter that comes when white
lab coats rule: shrines to white mice and rats, quotes from
Sherlock Holmes, happy and sad-faced posters of T cells.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the world's most recognizable symbol for
help-is-on-the-way takes on a different meaning, more along the
lines of
help-is-on-the-way-as-soon-as-it-undergoes-the-rigors-of-science _
from chalkboard theory to clinical trials to Food and Drug
Administration approval, a process that can take a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 15 years, developing screening tests to ensure the
safety of the nation's blood supply has filled the research plate
at the Red Cross labs. But in the next century, its scientists may
well be known for such discoveries as making therapeutic proteins
for hemophilic patients with the milk of genetically altered
(transgenic) pigs, and pinpointing the gene that triggers blood
flow to cancerous tumors.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, an invention called fibrin sealant is
being tested. On a bandage, it acts as an instant clot on wounds as
soon as it becomes wet with blood. In its foam form, it reacts on
penetrating injuries, such as gunshots and knife stabs, by
expanding like shaving cream, then sealing off blood vessels. Every
year, nearly 50,000 people die of excessive bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This here is a slightly injured pot roast standing in for
wounded muscle tissue of a person,'' said Beall, one of 230 Red
Cross researchers at the lab. ``We care more about pot roasts here
than most of the world put together, I bet.''
</P>
<P>
   With a $6 million grant from the Army, Beall and colleague
Martin MacPhee have perfected the recipe of fibrinogen and
thrombin, two clotting proteins of the blood that form the scab on
skin. The proteins are found in a person's plasma _ one of blood's
three main components, along with red blood cells and platelets.
</P>
<P>
   Since half of all battlefield fatalities are from soldiers
bleeding to death, the military has long dreamed of a portable and
fast-acting way to patch massive wounds temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept for a fibrin sealant goes back to World War II,''
said MacPhee. ``The thinking was to purify the two proteins out and
form a blood clot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first liquid concoctions were cumbersome, so they
weren't good for medic and ambulance rescues, said MacPhee. These
liquid ``glues,'' however, are useful in surgery and are used
widely in Europe. One of them, called BioGlue, is made by the
Kennesaw firm of CryoLife Inc. and is undergoing clinical approval
for use in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Red Cross holds the intellectual rights to further
develop the fibrin sealant idea into a foam, spray and external and
internal bandages, no other company can develop or manufacture
them. But finding a way to replicate the remarkable natural
clotting reaction of blood was not easy, because when the two
proteins of fibrinogen and thrombin touch, they instantly start
forming a scab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to figure out how to put the two proteins on a
bandage so they didn't react until they were needed,'' MacPhee
said, holding up a fibrin sealant bandage that looks like a
standard piece of gauze except for the sticky backing. ``The idea
was to be able to apply direct pressure with this bandage and let
the fibrin form on the wound and then form a clot.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the invention is still pending a patent review, MacPhee
cannot disclose exactly how the fibrin sealant bandage is made.
</P>
<P>
   All he'll say is that it's a freeze-dried substance and it
works. Really, really well.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the sealant bandage capable of controlling external
life-threatening injuries, it creates a clot 10 times stronger than
that formed by the body on its own. And used internally, it can
even disappear because it's made of the same absorbable material as
internal surgical stitches. Versions of the bandage have been
created for massive internal injuries, such as those sustained in
automobile crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around a steering wheel, a victim of an automobile crash
often hemorrhages from a ruptured liver, bleeding that even
surgeons cannot stop. The reason: The bandage technique used is
unwieldy and ineffective, and it hasn't changed in 3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unrolling a huge piece of gauze the length of his office,
William Drohan, who heads the Red Cross' plasma development branch,
demonstrates that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what they pack into your belly to put pressure on your
liver to stop the bleeding,'' he said. ``This is 15 feet long and 3
feet wide. It's left inside (the patient) but the gauze has to be
replaced the next day, and when it's removed it pulls on the part
of the wound that's healed.''
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of people suffering severe liver injuries die,
Drohan said, because the bleeding cannot be stemmed. But a new
4-inch-square surgical bandage sealed with the clotting fibrin
formula could change that statistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bandage is absorbable. Once we stop the bleeding, we
simply close (in surgery) and we don't have to reopen to put in
another bandage,'' Drohan said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Army has conducted successful experiments using the
fibrin bandages internally on pigs' bleeding livers.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to test the bandages on surgical patients is under review
by the federal government. Clinical trials could begin next year
involving men having their prostate removed, a procedure usually
triggered by cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time next year, we could finally be getting close to
using these fibrin bandages,'' MacPhee said. ``This is an
opportunity to help a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   And save some precious pints of blood?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably help somewhat, but I don't think it will
affect the need that much,'' MacPhee said. ``And there's always two
sides to everything. We need people to give blood because that's
where we get the plasma. We need their plasma to create the
bandages to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's always junk-food Genie should blood plasma donations
go dry.
</P>
<P>
   She's a 1,500-pound porker genetically altered to produce
therapeutic human proteins in her milk. Genie and other
experimental pigs used in Red Cross and Army research are bred at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va., where scientists
specialize in transgenic technology. Making human proteins in pigs'
milk with clotting factors needed to make the fibrin sealant
bandages is under way.
</P>
<P>
   But first you have to milk the pigs _ something rarely done.
``But with pigs, you can always bribe them with food,'' MacPhee
said. ``We found Genie loves cheese Doritos. Put them in the
feeding trough and you can milk them as much as you want.

 &HT;    How the Red Cross keeps standing
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Based on the International Red Cross, which was founded in
1864 as a volunteer humanitarian effort to care for sick and
wounded during war. Over the years, it expanded to disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   _ In America, founded in 1881 by Clara Barton, a Massachusetts
schoolteacher who helped wounded soldiers during the Civil War. She
became known as the ``angel of the battlefield'' and led the charge
to start the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red Cross emblem: Sometimes called the Geneva cross, in
recognition of the Geneva Convention, the 1864 international treaty
that established the organization. The red cross on a white
background is the inverse of the Swiss flag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Annual budget: $1.9 billion, raised through individual
donations, United Way campaign, and funding from corporations and
foundations. On occasion, it's reimbursed for services. Also
collects revenue from patented research innovations, contracts and
investments. About 92 cents of every dollar donated goes directly
to Red Cross services that help people in need.
</P>
<P>
   _ Staff: More than 1.3 million volunteers and 29,850 paid staff
nationwide. Policy is set by an all-volunteer board of governors,
which oversees the 1,300 local chapters. Elizabeth Dole has been
its president since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   _ Research: Begun in 1961. Contributed to ensuring the safety of
the nation's blood supply, developing screening tests for HIV,
hepatitis and other infectious diseases. Also developed transfusion
and other blood-related technology. Budget: $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blood services: Started in 1948 for civilians after first
being directed to World War II soldiers. Yearly collects about 6
million units of blood from 4.5 million donors, approximately half
of the amount of blood donated annually in the United States. The
blood is separated into red blood cells, plasma and platelets, used
for trauma victims, cancer patients and surgeries in 3,000
hospitals. Less than 5 percent of healthy Americans eligible to
give blood actually do so.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every year, 4 million patients receive transfused blood.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every day, 40,000 units of blood are needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every second, someone needs blood.

   ROCKVILEE, Md. _ Help! The pot roast is bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Call the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gunshot, Dawson Beall deftly deduces. He picks up a
silver canister, shoots white powder into the wound, then adds a
squirt of water. In seconds, the roast erupts with white foam, like
a second-grader's volcano science project.
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding stops.
</P>
<P>
   Another pot roast is saved.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the laboratories of the American Red Cross, where
tomorrow's lifesaving techniques are perfected today on pigs, pot
roasts and other props.
</P>
<P>
   Inventions and innovations to help trauma victims are just some
of the ongoing research projects under way at the Jerome H. Holland
Laboratory for the Biomedical Sciences. The unpretentious two-floor
building is full of the usual quirky clutter that comes when white
lab coats rule: shrines to white mice and rats, quotes from
Sherlock Holmes, happy and sad-faced posters of T cells.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the world's most recognizable symbol for
help-is-on-the-way takes on a different meaning, more along the
lines of
help-is-on-the-way-as-soon-as-it-undergoes-the-rigors-of-science _
from chalkboard theory to clinical trials to Food and Drug
Administration approval, a process that can take a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 15 years, developing screening tests to ensure the
safety of the nation's blood supply has filled the research plate
at the Red Cross labs. But in the next century, its scientists may
well be known for such discoveries as making therapeutic proteins
for hemophilic patients with the milk of genetically altered
(transgenic) pigs, and pinpointing the gene that triggers blood
flow to cancerous tumors.
</P>
<P>
   On this particular day, an invention called fibrin sealant is
being tested. On a bandage, it acts as an instant clot on wounds as
soon as it becomes wet with blood. In its foam form, it reacts on
penetrating injuries, such as gunshots and knife stabs, by
expanding like shaving cream, then sealing off blood vessels. Every
year, nearly 50,000 people die of excessive bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   ``This here is a slightly injured pot roast standing in for
wounded muscle tissue of a person,'' said Beall, one of 230 Red
Cross researchers at the lab. ``We care more about pot roasts here
than most of the world put together, I bet.''
</P>
<P>
   With a $6 million grant from the Army, Beall and colleague
Martin MacPhee have perfected the recipe of fibrinogen and
thrombin, two clotting proteins of the blood that form the scab on
skin. The proteins are found in a person's plasma _ one of blood's
three main components, along with red blood cells and platelets.
</P>
<P>
   Since half of all battlefield fatalities are from soldiers
bleeding to death, the military has long dreamed of a portable and
fast-acting way to patch massive wounds temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept for a fibrin sealant goes back to World War II,''
said MacPhee. ``The thinking was to purify the two proteins out and
form a blood clot.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first liquid concoctions were cumbersome, so they
weren't good for medic and ambulance rescues, said MacPhee. These
liquid ``glues,'' however, are useful in surgery and are used
widely in Europe. One of them, called BioGlue, is made by the
Kennesaw firm of CryoLife Inc. and is undergoing clinical approval
for use in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Red Cross holds the intellectual rights to further
develop the fibrin sealant idea into a foam, spray and external and
internal bandages, no other company can develop or manufacture
them. But finding a way to replicate the remarkable natural
clotting reaction of blood was not easy, because when the two
proteins of fibrinogen and thrombin touch, they instantly start
forming a scab.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to figure out how to put the two proteins on a
bandage so they didn't react until they were needed,'' MacPhee
said, holding up a fibrin sealant bandage that looks like a
standard piece of gauze except for the sticky backing. ``The idea
was to be able to apply direct pressure with this bandage and let
the fibrin form on the wound and then form a clot.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the invention is still pending a patent review, MacPhee
cannot disclose exactly how the fibrin sealant bandage is made.
</P>
<P>
   All he'll say is that it's a freeze-dried substance and it
works. Really, really well.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the sealant bandage capable of controlling external
life-threatening injuries, it creates a clot 10 times stronger than
that formed by the body on its own. And used internally, it can
even disappear because it's made of the same absorbable material as
internal surgical stitches. Versions of the bandage have been
created for massive internal injuries, such as those sustained in
automobile crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Wrapped around a steering wheel, a victim of an automobile crash
often hemorrhages from a ruptured liver, bleeding that even
surgeons cannot stop. The reason: The bandage technique used is
unwieldy and ineffective, and it hasn't changed in 3,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unrolling a huge piece of gauze the length of his office,
William Drohan, who heads the Red Cross' plasma development branch,
demonstrates that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what they pack into your belly to put pressure on your
liver to stop the bleeding,'' he said. ``This is 15 feet long and 3
feet wide. It's left inside (the patient) but the gauze has to be
replaced the next day, and when it's removed it pulls on the part
of the wound that's healed.''
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of people suffering severe liver injuries die,
Drohan said, because the bleeding cannot be stemmed. But a new
4-inch-square surgical bandage sealed with the clotting fibrin
formula could change that statistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bandage is absorbable. Once we stop the bleeding, we
simply close (in surgery) and we don't have to reopen to put in
another bandage,'' Drohan said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Army has conducted successful experiments using the
fibrin bandages internally on pigs' bleeding livers.
</P>
<P>
   A plan to test the bandages on surgical patients is under review
by the federal government. Clinical trials could begin next year
involving men having their prostate removed, a procedure usually
triggered by cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time next year, we could finally be getting close to
using these fibrin bandages,'' MacPhee said. ``This is an
opportunity to help a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   And save some precious pints of blood?
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably help somewhat, but I don't think it will
affect the need that much,'' MacPhee said. ``And there's always two
sides to everything. We need people to give blood because that's
where we get the plasma. We need their plasma to create the
bandages to stop the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's always junk-food Genie should blood plasma donations
go dry.
</P>
<P>
   She's a 1,500-pound porker genetically altered to produce
therapeutic human proteins in her milk. Genie and other
experimental pigs used in Red Cross and Army research are bred at
Virginia Polytechnic Institute in Blacksburg, Va., where scientists
specialize in transgenic technology. Making human proteins in pigs'
milk with clotting factors needed to make the fibrin sealant
bandages is under way.
</P>
<P>
   But first you have to milk the pigs _ something rarely done.
``But with pigs, you can always bribe them with food,'' MacPhee
said. ``We found Genie loves cheese Doritos. Put them in the
feeding trough and you can milk them as much as you want.

SPORTS COLUMN: ONETIME PRINCE OF THE CITY COMES BACK TO A CAMPUS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the weather was good, Bob Zawoluk would leave his rented
room and exercise his aging athlete's body. He had lived all over
New York in his turbulent life _ had even spent two years
``upstate,'' as the euphemism goes _ and now he was in the Bronx,
strange territory.
</P>
<P>
   He gravitated to the track at Lehman College, struck by the
unexpected classic Gothic beauty of the campus. How different it
was, he thought, from the grim old buildings when St. John's was
still in Brooklyn, back when he was a basketball star.
</P>
<P>
   Being on a college campus rejuvenated him, better than the hip
replacement of a decade ago. As he walked the track, he began to
think that maybe there was a place for him in this world, a place
where young people wore shorts and sneakers, where people still had
hope.
</P>
<P>
   On a hopeful afternoon last spring, Zawoluk walked into the
office of a stranger, the athletic director at Lehman, Dr. Martin
Zwerin, and asked if he could volunteer his services. ``I had never
heard of him,'' Zwerin admitted, ``but he showed me some old
clippings.''
</P>
<P>
   The clippings were of the days when Zawoluk was a prince of this
city, averaging 20 points a game, when the college boys filled
Madison Square Garden. The athletic director was intrigued enough
to ask his new coach, Darryl Jacobs, if he was interested, and this
is how Bob Zawoluk has come to be an assistant, at the age of 68.
</P>
<P>
   There are other clippings involving Bob Zawoluk. In 1986, he
rammed cars in three different automobile agencies over commissions
he felt were due him, and he spent time in jail before a friend
posted bond. In 1991, there was a two-year sentence for armed
robbery, which Zawoluk said was a matter of finding a pen knife on
him after he had left a store where he had shoplifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't deserve two years for that,'' he said Friday, sitting
in the office at Lehman, ``but after all the things I had done, I
guess I deserved two years.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the crack cocaine, he said, starting with a free sample,
leading to shoplifting. He went through rehabilitation programs in
prison and has been straight for ``five or six years now,'' but he
notes that ``once an addict, always an addict.'' And he can never
get back the lost jobs, the broken marriage, the times when he did
not see his four daughters, the periods of temper and instability
when he drifted far outside the circle of St. John's, with only a
few old friends still in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   He told Zwerin about his substance problem, and told the rest
openly when the question was raised. The best part about this story
is that the athletic director and the coach have never faltered in
their commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father once told me, `No fool lives to be old; all the
brave ones are dead,' '' said Jacobs, who is also vice president
for marketing and sales at Valley National Bank in Wayne, N.J.
``People who have felt the pain have a story to tell. Bob has some
wisdom in him. That's why I want him to work with my big men.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I teach them how to grab the guy's shirt,'' Zawoluk said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And step on their toes,'' Jacobs added.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman is a commuter city school, with no athletic scholarships
for the students, many of them older with outside jobs, a far cry
from the slick young players Zawoluk ran with.
</P>
<P>
   Zawoluk, at 6 feet 6 inches, was substantial enough to bang with
almost anybody (except Clyde Lovellette of Kansas, ``my nemesis'')
and smooth enough to shoot facing the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is from Generation A,'' said Jacobs, a former player for
William Penn College in Iowa. ``He comes from the time of the
give-and-go. Our players are from Generation X. You get kids from
the urban areas, they're used to handling the ball. I tell them,
`The hardest player to guard is the player without the ball.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs has told the Lehman players that Zawoluk held the career
scoring record at St. John's for 32 years before Chris Mullin, and
that he played three years in the National Basketball Association
before a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are mesmerized by him,'' Jacobs said.
</P>
<P>
   Zawoluk does not claim to be au courant, aside from what he sees
on the tube, but he has played against the best in the world. The
players might ask him about the tense game at Kentucky, with Solly
Walker, the first black player in the history of St. John's. Or
what it was like for a white guy to room with a black man for the
first time, the prejudices that broke down. Or what it was like to
play Kansas, with its scrappy reserve guard named Dean Smith. Or
about the eager little man who wanted so desperately to play ball
for St. John's, by the name of Lou Carnesecca. Smith and Carnesecca
are legends now, revered at North Carolina and St. John's. They
have had their careers. Bob Zawoluk, from Generation A, is still
seeking his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at John Glenn, back in space at 77,'' Zwerin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I have some time,'' said Zawoluk, who cited the reborn
Darryl Strawberry as his role model. ``All I know is that when I
say my prayers, I think about the others I saw on the street, the
prostitutes, the shoplifters. A lot of them didn't make it. I've
been blessed.''
</P>
<P>
   Zwerin, the athletic director, says this is why there are city
schools like Lehman, where people can walk on campus and feel the
beauty and the order, where people can feel hope, the way Bob
Zawoluk did.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Based on the International Red Cross, which was founded in
1864 as a volunteer humanitarian effort to care for sick and
wounded during war. Over the years, it expanded to disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   _ In America, founded in 1881 by Clara Barton, a Massachusetts
schoolteacher who helped wounded soldiers during the Civil War. She
became known as the ``angel of the battlefield'' and led the charge
to start the American Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red Cross emblem: Sometimes called the Geneva cross, in
recognition of the Geneva Convention, the 1864 international treaty
that established the organization. The red cross on a white
background is the inverse of the Swiss flag.
</P>
<P>
   _ Annual budget: $1.9 billion, raised through individual
donations, United Way campaign, and funding from corporations and
foundations. On occasion, it's reimbursed for services. Also
collects revenue from patented research innovations, contracts and
investments. About 92 cents of every dollar donated goes directly
to Red Cross services that help people in need.
</P>
<P>
   _ Staff: More than 1.3 million volunteers and 29,850 paid staff
nationwide. Policy is set by an all-volunteer board of governors,
which oversees the 1,300 local chapters. Elizabeth Dole has been
its president since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   _ Research: Begun in 1961. Contributed to ensuring the safety of
the nation's blood supply, developing screening tests for HIV,
hepatitis and other infectious diseases. Also developed transfusion
and other blood-related technology. Budget: $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blood services: Started in 1948 for civilians after first
being directed to World War II soldiers. Yearly collects about 6
million units of blood from 4.5 million donors, approximately half
of the amount of blood donated annually in the United States. The
blood is separated into red blood cells, plasma and platelets, used
for trauma victims, cancer patients and surgeries in 3,000
hospitals. Less than 5 percent of healthy Americans eligible to
give blood actually do so.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every year, 4 million patients receive transfused blood.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every day, 40,000 units of blood are needed.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every second, someone needs blood.

 &HT;    California charities a model for Georgia
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Calif. _ Linda Viveros suffered from recurring ear
infections. Angel Perez was having chronic nosebleeds. Kevin Mendez
needed an eye exam and new glasses.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the youngsters has health coverage. That's why their
parents brought them on a recent afternoon to the Venice Family
Clinic, a few blocks from the in-line skaters and street artists of
Venice Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the clinic couldn't keep up with an overflow of
uninsured patients, turning away up to 75 people a day. That
patient congestion was eased, though, when a Woodland Hills-based
charitable foundation stepped in with an injection of funds.
</P>
<P>
   That foundation, the California Endowment, and a sister
organization based in Oakland, are sinking at least $200 million
this year into such health care projects across California.
</P>
<P>
   Starting this month, those California charities will serve as a
model for a new health care foundation in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia organization, albeit with a smaller nest egg, is
connected to the California foundations by both health care and
history. Each charity has sprouted from Blue Cross plans and their
decisions to switch to for-profit companies.
</P>
<P>
   Healthcare Georgia was born out of a court case involving
several little-known consumer groups, which challenged the 1996
for-profit transition of Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   In a settlement in July, Blue Cross agreed to endow a new
foundation with stock and warrants amounting to slightly less than
20 percent of the equity value of Cerulean, its parent company.
</P>
<P>
   The value of that endowment was put at $80 million when, the
next day, Blue Cross announced plans to be acquired by WellPoint
Health Networks.
</P>
<P>
   Upon the completion of that deal, those Cerulean shares will
convert to WellPoint stock.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, WellPoint is the parent of Blue Cross of California,
which, in its conversion to for-profit status, created the two
California endowments, now with assets of more than $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The California foundations fund projects in both health care and
a broader ``health'' category, which addresses a range of needs,
from environmental projects to welfare reform. ``We don't do
cookie-cutter grants,'' says Maureen Finan of the endowment.
</P>
<P>
   But giving away money isn't a smooth, easy process, foundation
officials insist. Adds Steven Uranga McKane, former chief executive
officer of the California Endowment: ``There are more needs than
resources available. You have to make choices.''
</P>
<P>
   Healthcare Georgia will face similar limits. It won't be able,
by itself, to provide many medical services directly _ or solve
Georgia's most prominent health needs, including the lack of
insurance for more than 1 million residents.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia fund, with nine newly appointed board members, will
have its first meeting this month. ``We need to make some important
decisions about financial matters and about how to operate the
foundation,'' says Linda Lowe, a consumer health advocate named to
the board. ``Then we can get on to the important business of trying
to make a difference in health care for Georgians.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia can learn from the California experience, says Mark
Smith, CEO of the California HealthCare Foundation, the twin to the
California Endowment.
</P>
<P>
   ``You figure out where the money you spend can have a multiplier
effect,'' Smith says. ``They'll have to say no to dozens of
worthwhile projects for each one they approve.''
</P>
<P>
   The Venice clinic, which serves thousands of uninsured patients
a year, received a ``yes'' after it took over two similar clinics
that the Los Angeles County government jettisoned. That's when the
California Endowment chipped in $250,000 over two years. ``The
funds allowed the clinic to expand access to increasingly larger
numbers of people in need,'' said Jeffrey Catania, development
director.
</P>
<P>
   The Venice clinic, with an $8.7 million budget from various
private and public sources, has cobbled together volunteer
physicians and staff, along with donations of pharmaceuticals and
hospital services.
</P>
<P>
   About 85 percent of patients have no insurance, says Susan
Fleischman, medical director. ``The working poor is probably the
No. 1 group: waiters, pool men, housekeepers, gardeners, child care
workers.'' Fifteen percent of the patients are homeless.
</P>
<P>
   These patients often get referred to another California
Endowment grant recipient, Chrysalis, which helps homeless people
with job training and counseling. It operates out of a converted
storefront and warehouse in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   With $500,000 over two years from the endowment, Chrysalis has
been able to launch a mental-health counseling program.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeless clients have trouble not with finding a job but
with keeping it, says Chrysalis director Stephen Knight. The funds
have gone to hiring new staff, including Danealia Maretka, a
marriage and family counselor, who helps deliver group and
individual therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all (these clients) have mental health and substance
abuse issues,'' Maretka says. ``They get the job, then come down
from the high. The depression problem is still there, the substance
abuse problem is still there, the relationship problem is still
there. Now there's a job pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   So along with counseling help, Chrysalis tracks more than 300
former clients.
</P>
<P>
   The new funding has shown results: ``Our job retention rate has
climbed 73 percent after 24 months,'' Knight says.

 &HT;    Women execs prominent as gas scramble begins
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two midsize Georgia companies _ both headed by women _
are ready to claim their share of the state's natural gas market,
which officially opens to competition today.
</P>
<P>
   Livia Whisenhunt, president of Atlanta-based PS Energy Group,
and Deborah Latham, president of Roswell-based Optimum Energy
Sources, are standouts in a male-dominated industry.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure whether it's a fluke, but women have been
quite visible in Georgia's deregulated natural gas industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never a line for the ladies' room when you're in the
energy business,'' said Paula Rosput, newly appointed president and
chief operating officer of Atlanta Gas Light Co. Rosput, previously
with Duke Energy in Houston, took over Atlanta Gas Light in
September to manage the transition from monopoly supplier to a
distribution company whose customers will be marketers like
Whisenhunt and Latham. Rosput's predecessor as acting president was
Catherine Land-Waters, now customer services vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Only six of 19 companies that have qualified to compete are
Georgia-based. Three are start-ups, one is Atlanta Gas Light's
marketing affiliate, Georgia Natural Gas Services, and the others
are PS Energy and Optimum.
</P>
<P>
   Whisenhunt and Latham have been in the industry for years and
consider themselves competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask whether we hang out and have pajama parties and
sleepovers, and the answer is no,'' Latham said. She doubts many of
her customers realize her company is headed by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Both have experience in selling gas to large industrial
customers, a service area that has long been deregulated. Now, they
will be competing for residential and small-business customers.
</P>
<P>
   Different approaches
</P>
<P>
   Whisenhunt and Latham have different strategies for the new
natural gas market. Latham has jumped in with both feet, signing up
almost 1,000 customers to start service today. Whisenhunt is
holding off until Jan. 1 to serve residential customers, at least
to let the snags that have been apparent in the deregulation
start-up work themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   Latham, 45, a University of Tennessee graduate and Knoxville
native, spent 14 years in the computer software industry before she
launched Optimum in 1990. After calling on energy companies to sell
them software, she decided she ``could do this myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too stupid to know it was an all-male world,'' she now
says.
</P>
<P>
   Latham founded Optimum with three partners _ all since bought
out _ and a $40,000 investment. The company sold propane, diesel
and gasoline to large industrial customers. The first office, with
a leaky roof, was behind Cumberland Mall.
</P>
<P>
   Latham purchased 10 commercial propane and natural gas accounts
from Janie McClure, president of McClure Oil Co. and another member
of Atlanta's energy sorority. Latham had been a consultant to
McClure's company.
</P>
<P>
   Latham ``scratched and begged'' for the rest and now has more
than 300 customers. Optimum, which has 41 employees, has sales of
$35 million. Its offices are in Roswell just off Alpharetta
Highway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Latham bought two 18-wheelers and started Georgia Tank
Lines, which hauls gasoline to service stations for big oil
companies and other customers.
</P>
<P>
   With mom-and-pop gas stations on the wane, Latham began selling
natural gas to industrial customers to fill the gap. Earlier this
year, she started Peachtree Natural Gas to sell to homes and
smaller businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Because her company is small, Latham aggressively sought
partnerships with electric membership corporations to sell gas to
electricity customers.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina-based SCANA Energy, one of the big players, beat
out Optimum for the first deals with the Cobb and Snapping Shoals
EMCs, which covered 200,000 electricity customers. But she has
bounced back with agreements with the eight smaller electric co-ops
that together serve more than 300,000 homes and businesses. She's
also targeting dry cleaners operated by Korean-Americans, major
natural gas consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Latham has budgeted $2.5 million for advertising and has set her
sights on 11 percent of the market. She's prepared to lose money
for 18 months and is negotiating to sell a 25 percent stake in
Peachtree Natural Gas to a national energy concern she declines to
identify.
</P>
<P>
   Testing the market
</P>
<P>
   Whisenhunt, 40, is taking a more measured approach competition.
</P>
<P>
   She has hired Tausche Henderson Drake, the Atlanta ad agency, to
conduct focus group tests to gauge market reaction to her natural
gas company, GasKey, and to prepare TV and newspaper ads and direct
mail.
</P>
<P>
   Whisenhunt doesn't plan to start selling gas to residential
customers until Jan. 1, though service to business accounts _ 340
at last count _ begins Dec. 1. She cited too many uncertainties in
starting sooner, such as not knowing exactly what Atlanta Gas Light
will charge her company to deliver gas to her customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to jump into the market without being able to
commit to prices,'' Whisenhunt said.
</P>
<P>
   Like Latham, Whisenhunt started her firm from scratch and had
``no particular training'' for the energy business.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombian-born executive, who didn't go to college, started
out in business at age 21 by buying the inventory of a Lithonia
convenience store with a $200 down payment. The money came from the
sale of a horse.
</P>
<P>
   Whisenhunt sold the business five months later, then worked for
Conyers-based U.S. Enterprises, where she managed wholesale fuel
purchases and deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, she began brokering fuel on her own, then started
Petroleum Source and Systems Group in 1985 to distribute petroleum
products to commercial fleets. For two years, she operated the
business out of the basement of her Buckhead home.
</P>
<P>
   Whisenhunt got into natural gas in 1988 when diesel customers
wanted to switch fuels. She gained experience in dealing with the
suppliers she would need to serve customers in the new deregulated
market.
</P>
<P>
   The business, renamed PS Energy Group earlier this year, has
grown to $70 million in sales and 26 employees, and is housed in
offices on Clairmont Road near I-85. The company has more than 300
customers, including Coca-Cola Bottling Co., Georgia Power Co. and
the city of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Whisenhunt is currently involved in expanding her billing
business into four states. PS Energy Group recently signed up New
Centuries, a Colorado utility, for the service that involves
issuing credit cards to fleets so there are centralized records and
billing every time a car or truck fills up with gas.
</P>
<P>
   Whisenhunt is targeting a 6 percent natural gas market share by
emphasizing the company's local roots and attention to service.
Already, GasKey has received 1,000 calls from potential customers,
even before advertising can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be nuts to try and compete with Shell and SCANA,''
Whisenhunt says of two of the larger natural gas competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Georgians want to do business with companies out of South
Carolina, Texas and Canada, I don't think that's what the choice is
going to be.

 &HT;    Advice for recent grads: Eliminate debt
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As this year's college graduates settle into the work
world, a powerful thing is happening: They are worrying about
money.
</P>
<P>
   Not just about income, which is the usual worry for beginners,
but also about saving, investing and planning far ahead, even to
their retirements. That's new.
</P>
<P>
   We saw platoons of those thoughtful young strivers at The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Money&AMP;More Investment Conference in
September. They hustled from one seminar to the next, took notes
and asked probing questions.
</P>
<P>
   One question that came up repeatedly is this: I've got some
disposable income. Should I use my money to pay down my college
loans faster, or should I start investing for the future?
</P>
<P>
   It is an interesting question, mainly because there is no one
easy answer for every person or family. But the experts I posed the
question to were able to lay out enough ground rules to help most
people find their own answers.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what they had to say:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pay off credit card debts first. They typically come at very
high interest rates, perhaps 15 percent to 18 percent. That's a
tremendous load to carry around. It is much higher than the cost of
college loans. It also is much higher than you can reasonably hope
to make on investments.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have access to a 401(k) retirement plan, use it. The
main reason is employers typically match part of your contribution.
</P>
<P>
   If you put in 6 percent of your salary, for example, companies
typically put in another 3 percent. Let's say you make $40,000 a
year and put 6 percent, or $200 a month, into a 401(k). In a
typical plan, your employer would add another $100 to your account.
That's a 50 percent gain, and it's a freebie.
</P>
<P>
   _ Consider the tax consequences of your choices. For example,
federal income taxes are deferred on contributions to a 401(k). You
don't pay the taxes until you start withdrawing money from your
account after age 59 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, starting next year you may be able to get a
tax deduction on interest you pay on student loans. The maximum
deduction during 1998 will be $1,000, and there are other limits.
For a complete rundown on income and other limitations, go to
http://www.usagroup.com
</P>
<P>
   /students/taxbreak.htm (cq) on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Each individual will have to figure out how much those factors
would mean in his or her circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   _ Decide whether you have enough set aside for emergencies. Most
experts recommend a rainy-day fund big enough to pay your basic
expenses for three to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you get fired from your first job, or you find out you
can't bear to do the work. If you have an emergency stash, the job
loss is merely a problem. If you don't have the money, you're in a
crisis. Thus your first priority may be building up your emergency
fund.
</P>
<P>
   _ Factor in any major purchases you intend to make. If you plan
to buy a house, for example, lowering your debts can make it easier
to qualify for a mortgage. And the interest on home loans is
deductible, assuming you itemize.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are going into an immediate family situation or other
big obligations, I would suggest paying off debt as quickly as you
can,'' said Robert Errico, the president of Alliance Capital's
mutual funds division.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have passed all those hurdles and still have disposable
income, use at least a portion of it to start your investment
program. The sooner you start investing, the more your earnings
will compound.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the question of motivation. The longer you wait,
the harder it is to start saving. The sooner you start, the quicker
you will see the benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once young people see their quarterly statements and see the
balances growing, they want to put even more in,'' observed Charles
Frazier, a certified financial planner. ``I think encouraging the
habit of saving is going to help a lot more over time than paying
off a low-interest loan.''
</P>
<P>
   Errico suggested splitting up disposable income _ using part to
make extra payments on student loans and part to invest. ``It's
important to pay debt down, especially when you're just out of
college and are on your first job,'' he said. ``But even if you can
put away only $25 or $50 or $100 on a regular basis, it instills a
discipline and commitment to long-term investing that will benefit
you.''
</P>
<P>
   All these factors mean there's no single answer for every
individual. But at least they give you a framework for deciding.

 &HT;    Policyholders, execs, investors in line to profit
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gayle Taylor didn't get excited two years ago when she
read the letter.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was covered by health insurance from Blue Cross and
Blue Shield of Georgia, the letter told her, Taylor was eligible
for five free shares of its new parent company, Cerulean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just filled it out and sent it back in,'' says Taylor, a
bookkeeper for about 20 years with Franklin Ford Tractor, in
Cartersville. ``Five shares _ I thought, `What does that mean?'''
</P>
<P>
   What it now means is that Taylor, insured by Blue Cross through
her job, will likely be among 70,000 winners of an unusual
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   If the WellPoint acquisition of Blue Cross gets final approval,
as expected, policyholders who signed up for shares, at no cost,
will have a choice of taking $4,000 upon the merger's closing, or
an equivalent amount of WellPoint stock.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders themselves, as well as state Insurance
Commissioner John Oxendine, must approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is excited. ``I've never had anything like this,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   The 70,000 stockholders are among those who had individual Blue
Cross policies, or, like Taylor, were members of Blue Cross
employer plans that are not self-insured. The Cerulean shares were
offered as a result of Blue Cross' 1996 conversion from a nonprofit
to a for-profit company.
</P>
<P>
   But the policyholders won't be the biggest beneficiaries of the
merger. About 280 Blue Cross employees will share a $28 million
incentive bonus. The chief executive officer, Richard Shirk, could
receive more than $10 million in bonus and other compensation if he
departs the company after the deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Four executive vice presidents will each get a bonus of $1.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   And a group of private investors, who sank almost $50 million
into Cerulean during the conversion, will net a profit of $60
million in stock from their original investment. The biggest chunk
of profit, about $48 million, will go to the lead investors, Frank
Hanna III and his brother, David, who invested $40 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several individual policyholders interviewed, ranging
from retirees to corporate leaders, say they're happy with their
smaller slice of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of a windfall,'' says Jim Carson, chairman of the
board of Carter &AMP; Associates, an Atlanta-based commercial real
estate firm.
</P>
<P>
   Carson says he will get three times the allotment because he
purchased three individual Blue Cross policies for his adult
children, who all attend graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   Carson hasn't made a decision on cashing out or taking the
shares of WellPoint.
</P>
<P>
   Another policyholder, Athens attorney Upshaw Bentley says: ``I
think I prefer the cash. I haven't analyzed the company well
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   But no big splurge is planned. ``I guess I'll just put it in the
bank,'' Bentley says.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Jones, who runs a Decatur public affairs business, says
the gift makes up for the recent market slide.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my investments went down last month,'' she says.
``But I feel this helps even out things.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, health insurance policies don't normally distribute
freebies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways, it seems like a bonus,'' Jones says. ``I like to
think that in this world, we get some gifts and give some gifts.

 &HT;    Bringing patients into the fold at WellPoint
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WOODLAND HILLS, Calif. _ When Leonard Schaeffer refers to ``the
guys across the street,'' he's not talking about friendly
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Within blocks of Schaeffer and his WellPoint Health Networks are
the headquarters of three other health insurers, posted like
gunslingers here along Oxnard Street. One WellPoint exec calls it
``Managed Care Gulch.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent top gun, though, is Schaeffer, chief executive
officer of WellPoint, who has helped turn his company from a
money-losing nonprofit in 1986 into a for-profit powerhouse, the
emerging winner in this health-plan competition.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint has latched onto the consumer concept of patient
choice, promoting it through subsidiaries Blue Cross of California
and UniCare. The company also is known for a varied lineup of
health insurance alternatives _ including non-HMO managed care _
and tough negotiating with doctors and hospitals on fees.
</P>
<P>
   That WellPoint influence soon will pervade Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, the Woodland Hills-based company is expected to
acquire the state's largest insurer, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of
Georgia, in a $500 million deal. The company already has a foothold
here with about 100,000 Georgians in its UniCare plan.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Blue Cross of Georgia subsidiary will keep a local
headquarters in Atlanta, and its policies will still bear the Blue
Cross trademark, the parent company will likely infuse its savvy,
aggressive ways throughout Georgia _ tactics that have won both
converts and critics in California.
</P>
<P>
   Will Georgia see a sudden shift to a Wild West-style, managed
care shootout?
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer, who has eyed the Georgia market for years, downplays
the chances of major changes in Georgia after the acquisition.
WellPoint and Blue Cross of Georgia, he says, have similar
missions. WellPoint, though, may emphasize selling more policies to
small businesses and individuals in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very excited about being in Georgia,'' Schaeffer says.
``It has a vibrant economy, and a good legislative and regulatory
climate.''
</P>
<P>
   Major acquisitions
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the last thing Blue Cross of California would have
considered was expansion to another state. When Schaeffer arrived
as president, the health insurer was losing about $1 million a day.
</P>
<P>
   Now WellPoint is building profits at a healthy clip while the
managed care industry is taking its financial lumps. More than half
the nation's HMOs lost money in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The last two years have added major acquisitions to WellPoint's
arsenal: John Hancock's and Massachusetts Mutual's health care
business, and now Blue Cross of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer is clearly the force behind the growth, and he is
well-compensated for his efforts, with a salary, bonus and other
compensation of $1.6 million in 1997. Short, bearded, with the
gravelly voice of a dock worker, he addresses the rise of
WellPoint, and his own image, in a straightforward, confident
manner.
</P>
<P>
   He's an aggressive negotiator who has been likened to a shark by
a California Medical Association official. ``If you're doing
business with Leonard, you'd better be pretty smart or you're going
to get eaten,'' the CMA's Steve Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocate Jamie Court of Santa Monica calls Schaeffer
``one of the classic HMO barons. He plots how to pinch pennies and
buy up health plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Schaeffer actually scores market points by emphasizing
managed care options other than an HMO. Blue Cross of California
runs the state's biggest preferred provider organization, in which
patients can visit doctors and hospitals that aren't in the
network, though at a higher out-of-pocket cost.
</P>
<P>
   The company's UniCare subsidiary _ which serves Texas, Georgia,
the Midwest and northern Virginia/D.C. area _ advertises itself,
strikingly, as the creator of ``medical miracles.'' Playing off
consumer distrust of managed care, one UniCare ad boasts: ``Woman
Actually Likes Her Company's Healthcare Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The message is all about choice. ``There is a general lack of
respect for what consumers want,'' Schaeffer explains. ``That's
this HMO backlash. People don't want to be pushed around.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that every American is going to wind up in an
HMO. We believe in customer choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans other than HMOs
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint succeeded by offering a range of plans other than
HMOs, says analyst Peter Costa of ABN AMRO. Unlike competitors,
``WellPoint didn't set out with the idea of driving everybody into
HMOs'' _ the conventional wisdom in the early 1990s, Costa adds.
The strategy: Let the market decide.
</P>
<P>
   Among WellPoint's innovations:
</P>
<P>
   _ A plan for small businesses that mirrors those for large
employers, in which one employee can choose a preferred provider
organization, another an HMO.
</P>
<P>
   _ An HMO in which a patient can visit an ob/gyn, an allergist, a
dermatologist or an ear, nose and throat doctor without having to
get a referral from a primary care physician.
</P>
<P>
   _ A PPO with no deductibles to meet _ just a co-payment for
services and a premium.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tattersall, owner of Tattersall Insurance Agency in
Calabasas, Calif., has the no-deductible plan for his own family,
paying a $40 co-pay out of pocket for doctor visits.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross officials, he adds, ``have been pioneers of
small-business insurance. ... They are phenomenal with customer
service.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Blue Cross of California's drawing power is the huge
army of doctors in its PPO. Of 55,000 practicing physicians in
California, Blue Cross' PPO network features 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   That far-flung pool helped sell the California Public Employees'
Retirement System. Blue Cross of California recently won a Calpers
contract to run its PPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were perceived strong in customer service, with good
discounts with providers, competitive administrative costs and good
(information) technology,'' says Margaret Stanley, health benefits
administrator for Calpers, which has about 1 million enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   At the small-group level, the 40 covered employees at the
Radisson Suite Hotel in Rancho Bernardo haven't voiced any
complaints about their Blue Cross of California HMO and PPO, says
benefits chief Michele Burton. ``The premium has been reasonable,''
she adds. ``There have been years that the premium went up, and
years that it went down.''
</P>
<P>
   'A really seedy practice'
</P>
<P>
   But some consumer advocates perceive an underside to WellPoint's
strategies. They lump Blue Cross of California with other insurers:
no better, no worse in treating members.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wield a lot of power,'' says Bonnie Burns, a Northern
California-based advocate. ``I can't see they're any different from
other insurers. They don't seem to have the mission they used to
have (as a nonprofit).''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates point out that in some areas, Blue Cross of California
this year began charging its Medicare HMO members a $30-plus
monthly premium _ vs. no premium in 1997 _ and also discontinued
their prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Another Blue Cross member has filed a lawsuit over the company's
phasing out a policy that promised not to base premium increases on
a person's age.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Gianelli, a Los Angeles attorney who represents the
plaintiffs in that class-action suit, says Blue Cross took
advantage of a provision that allows such changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of reasons why it doesn't apply,'' Gianelli
says. ``They use that provision to systematically reduce benefits
and choices of my clients.''
</P>
<P>
   And consumer advocate Court, while conceding the actions of Blue
Cross of California aren't worse than other insurers', says the
company recently raised rates for individual PPO policyholders by
55 percent. WellPoint counters that the average increase was
actually 25 percent, and only no-deductible policies were affected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Court says: ``There's a pattern here of Blue Cross
pushing people out of policies that appear to be secure and
lifelong. That's a really seedy practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are creating too-good-to-be-true products, then backing
out of promises they've made. Consumers are finding they're
nickel-and-dimed to death.''
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint disputes that accusation, citing its overall strategy
of putting consumers in control of choosing a health plan.
</P>
<P>
   And among 1997 consumer grievances and complaints reported to a
state agency, Blue Cross of California received fewer reported
problems from its members (.89 per 10,000 members) than the state
average for health plans. (.98).
</P>
<P>
   However, the medical community in California can be heard
muttering about WellPoint's tightfisted ways.
</P>
<P>
   Giant hospital system Sutter Health of Sacramento, seeking
reimbursement increases from WellPoint, actually terminated its
contract with Blue Cross of California before reaching an
agreement. With Catholic Healthcare West, a pricing deal was
reached just hours before its 33 hospitals went off Blue Cross'
network.
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint notes that there was no disruption of patient service
as a result of these hospital stalemates.
</P>
<P>
   Still, relations with doctor groups have been equally frosty.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a state judge ordered WellPoint to submit to
arbitration with a class of thousands of doctors, who charge the
company violated its contract by paying less than it promised for
medical services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some significant problems'' (with WellPoint), says
Dr. Robert Reid, an ob/gyn in Santa Barbara, and president of the
California Medical Association. ``They've been tough negotiators.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding down cost
</P>
<P>
   WellPoint defends this fiscal prickliness by pointing to the
need of its customers _ employers and individual policyholders _ to
hold down costs. ``We expect a very affordable price,'' Schaeffer
says.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians may see lower rates, but they will get more patients
as a result of working with Blue Cross, Schaeffer adds.
</P>
<P>
   The California Medical Association, though, notes on its Web
site that Blue Cross' HMO had among the lowest portions of premium
dollars going to medical costs _ and more going to administration
and profits _ of state health plans during fiscal 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the right number to evaluate WellPoint, Schaeffer
insists. ``The question is, are you creating value for your
customers?''
</P>
<P>
   He holds up charts on WellPoint's enrollment growth, in
California and elsewhere. ``By far, we're the fastest-growing plan
(in California).''
</P>
<P>
   The stock price has surged $42.25 this year, closing at $73.62
1/2 on Friday. Third-quarter net income increased 20 percent from
the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
   The CEO doesn't shy away from talk of profitability. A good goal
is a 15 percent annual increase in net income, similar to what a
company such as Coca-Cola produces, he says.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that, WellPoint revenue must climb as well. And
that, Schaeffer concedes, may mean more acquisitions for the
company, beyond the imminent deal in Georgia.

 &HT;    Louisiana gaming: Widespread corruption in licensing alleged
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ People who tried to prevent casinos from coming
here had a favorite saying: Bring gambling into Louisiana and
you'll be throwing gasoline on a bonfire. Their prediction seems to
be coming true.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation into how casino licenses were dispensed
resulted in a busy October at the federal courthouse in Baton
Rouge. Three associates of former Gov. Edwin Edwards have copped
guilty pleas and made deals with the U.S. Attorney's Office, and in
the process have revealed lurid details of payoffs, extortion and
illegal influence at three casinos. A fourth man, a former state
employee, pleaded guilty to helping Edwards hire an electronics
expert to wiretap the phones of FBI agents who were investigating
Edwards's dealings with the gaming industry.
</P>
<P>
   Also in recent weeks, two members of the state's revamped
gambling board _ a supposedly squeaky clean regulatory agency set
up by Gov. Mike Foster _ were named in the federal investigation of
Edwards. One of them allegedly was influenced by Edwards to vote in
favor of a gaming license for Edwards' friend, Edward DeBartolo
Jr., owner of the San Francisco 49ers. A state senator also is
accused of helping Edwards influence the board.
</P>
<P>
   Foster has asked one of the board members to resign, but he
refused. The investigated members did, however, recuse themselves
from the final vote allowing construction to resume on the troubled
land-based casino in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   And all that was just in the past four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   More members of Edwards' inner circle are expected to make deals
with the U.S. Attorney, and everyone is on ``Edwards watch,''
waiting for the government to deliver its long-promised indictments
against the four-term governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible for Louisiana to regulate gambling,'' said
C.B. Forgotsen, a New Orleans attorney and longtime gambling foe.
``It doesn't make a difference who the governor is, gambling is
going to control your political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Corruption and favoritism have been alleged since the gaming
industry came to Louisiana. It is now well known that 13 of the 15
riverboat casino licenses awarded here went to friends and
associates of Edwards. And in 1994, a video poker company was
accused by federal investigators of being a front for the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana is the only state that has recently authorized
gambling _ there are about nine such states _ that has really run
into significant issues of corruption and scandal,'' said Bill
Eadington, director of the Institute for the Study of Gambling and
Commercial Gaming at the University of Nevada-Reno. ``What is
sordid about this story is that is says Louisiana does business in
a manner that forces companies to compromise their moral and legal
values.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to blame the troubles on Louisiana's affection
_ or at least tolerance _ for politicians who play fast and loose
with the rules, but experts say another more tangible reason the
casino industry has been so scandalous is the premium placed on
licenses.
</P>
<P>
   When the Louisiana Legislature voted to allow casinos into the
state, it limited the industry to 15 riverboats and one land-based
operation, to be in New Orleans. In Mississippi, where gambling has
been so successful that it has been called a ``miracle,'' there was
a licensing process, but no limit on the number of casinos that
could bob on the Mississippi River or on the Gulf Coast. So far
there are 30 casinos in eight counties in Mississippi_and no major
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were, on the surface, perfectly good reasons to restrict
the gambling,'' said Tim Ryan, dean of the College of Business at
the University of New Orleans. ``People said we should restrict it
so we wouldn't end up covered up in casinos. That's a hard point to
ignore or vote against. But we created a mechanism where a license
is coveted and worth a great deal of money. And then it became the
government's responsibility to dole out the licenses. That creates
a recipe _ an environment _ for corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little chance the process will change here, or that the
Legislature will get enough votes anytime soon to make casinos
illegal again. Gambling was put to a statewide vote two years ago,
and although almost half the parishes voted out video poker _ the
machines in those areas will be unplugged next June _ all of the
parishes with riverboat casinos opted to keep them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling has been good for the state,'' said state Rep. Edwin
Murray, a pro-gaming legislator from New Orleans. And, he said,
Foster's new gaming board and reorganized regulatory system should
clean things up. ``I don't think just because there has been a
single allegation of a single incident with the present gaming
board that you can paint the whole board with that brush.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is, has gambling been worth all the scandal?
</P>
<P>
   There is a general assumption that gambling has not been as
successful here as in next-door Mississippi, in part because of the
spectacular failure of the Harrah's land-based casino in downtown
New Orleans. It went bankrupt three years ago before it even had a
chance to move into its permanent facility on Canal Street.
</P>
<P>
   But, in fact, Louisiana's casino business is booming, so much so
that Harrah's is eager to get back in the game. The company has
reorganized, and with the unanimous blessing of the gaming board
construction will resume on the casino, and the slots should start
ringing in a year.
</P>
<P>
   A University of New Orleans study due to be published next year
found that the Louisiana gambling industry is grossing more money
than Mississippi's. The state's 13 riverboat casinos and thousands
of video poker machines gross $2.2 billion annually. Mississippi's
30 casinos gross 1.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, taxes on casinos are as much as four times higher in
Louisiana. Mississippi gets about $250 million a year in tax money;
Louisiana, more than $270 million a year from the casinos alone.
Harrah's in New Orleans will add more than $200 million to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about the Mississippi Miracle and how gambling is
a disaster in Louisiana, but in terms of revenue, that doesn't seem
to be the case,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Even opponents have to admit gambling has been a boon to the
areas where boats are docked. After becoming a near ghost town in
the oil bust of the 1970s and '80s, Lake Charles in southwest
Louisiana now has so much extra money it spent $350,000 on an
alligator pond to attract drivers off I-10. Not that people needed
more enticement: The three casinos in Lake Charles already draw
100,000 vistors every weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In Shreveport, one casino earns the city between $6 million and
$7 million annually, and the four casinos in the Shreveport-Bossier
City area have created 5,500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally I don't approve of gambling, but I have to admit it
has created jobs,'' said Shreveport Mayor Bo Williams. ``It's
unfortunate that gaming has been tainted by these allegations of
corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunate, but not surprising, apparently. Reluctant to roll
the dice on the future of gambling, Shreveport does not put
revenues from the casino into the city's main operating budget.
Instead, the money is used for things like capital improvements and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to depend on it and then have it disappear on
us,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   How the land-based casino will do in New Orleans this time is
anybody's guess. In recent years, two riverboat casinos docked
downtown set sail for more profitable waters after having
disappointing revenues. But Harrah's is painting a rosy picture of
the future. Fred Burford, president and CEO of Jazz Casino Co., the
reorganized company behind the Harrah's project, is projecting the
casino will make $358 million in its first year and will employ
2,500 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to have a world-class facility in a superior
location,'' Burford said. ``And if we don't make $358 million, we
can get by on $300 million.''
</P>
<P>
   For many gaming opponents, success is not the issue. Gaming
simply shouldn't be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our state constitution says the Legislature shall define and
suppress gambling,'' said state Sen. Jay Dardenne (R-Baton Rouge).
``You'd never know it looking at the proliferation of gambling in
Louisiana.

D'AMATO AND SCHUMER WIND DOWN A BITTER CONTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a bus trip across upstate New York and a visit to a
bustling kosher delicatessen on Manhattan's Lower East Side, Rep.
Charles Schumer and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato wrestled through the final
weekend of their campaign Saturday, closing out a contest notable
for its absence of discussion on the policy differences between
them.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer rolled confidently in his Blue Bird motorcoach through
some of the most Republican parts of New York _ upstate _ while his
campaign released a new television advertisement that sharply
attacks D'Amato's ethics, describing him as ``the most investigated
senator in New York history.'' D'Amato campaigned in his own back
yard, Nassau County, where he assailed Schumer for ``voting against
the interests of middle-class families,'' before driving into New
York City to have lunch with former Mayor Edward Koch at the Second
Avenue Deli.
</P>
<P>
   Both candidates seemed inclined to let their commercials attend
to their harsher attacks _ which is not unusual for the end of a
campaign _ as they set out on a bright and chilly Halloween day to
lay out the closing arguments of what has become one of the
nation's most competitive races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said it before and I'll say it again: You may not agree with
me on everything,'' D'Amato said as he heaped slabs of corned beef
onto his plate as television cameras jostled for a shot at the
famous delicatessen. ``Not even Mamma does. Not even the great
mayor does. But one thing they know: Al D'Amato gets it done.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, wearing a jacket and tie as he stood next to Democratic
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the state's senior senator, for a
rally at the Irish Center in South Buffalo, returned to the theme
that has defined his campaign since he declared victory in the
Democratic primary on Sept. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers deserve a senator who we can trust, a senator who
will not embarrass this state,'' the Brooklyn Democrat said. ``And
whether the yardstick is trust or whether the yardstick is
delivering on matters of critical importance to working families,
Al D'Amato does not measure up.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides view the outcome as impossible to predict. Thus, the
question of who will actually vote on Tuesday _ and how to assure
that their supporters turn out _ became a matter of consuming
interest to both sides. The Democrats seemed particularly
concerned, given years of declining turnout in New York City and
uncertainty about how, or if, President Clinton's difficulties in
Washington would affect the turnout in high-profile races like this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke by phone to about 150 party workers and district
leaders Saturday in a conference call arranged by Judith Hope, the
state's Democratic Party chairwoman. ``Chuck is looking like a
winner, talking like a winner, and we have to make sure he is a
winner,'' said Clinton, who campaigned twice in New York on behalf
of Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   The day's recriminations captured the tone of a campaign that
even the candidates' supporters have come to describe as largely
devoid of a discussion of issues _ even though D'Amato, a
Republican seeking a fourth term, and Schumer hold strongly
divergent views on issues including fighting crime, abortion rights
and regulating the nation's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Neither man had delivered a single major policy speech in the 46
days of the general election race through Saturday. Of the two,
only Schumer had offered any new proposals on what he would do in
the Senate _ making college tuition tax deductible for most
families. And with few exceptions, their television advertisements
in the second-most expensive Senate race in the nation's history
have been attacks, with D'Amato assailing Schumer for missing votes
in Congress, and Schumer consistently calling D'Amato a liar.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, advisers to both candidates offered the same
response when asked about the tone of the campaign: They blamed the
other side. ``It's not only the case that he has been more negative
_ it's that we have been more substantive,'' said Howard Wolfson,
who is Schumer's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Kieran Mahoney, who is one of D'Amato's senior advisers,
asserted that D'Amato tried to discuss issues of concern to New
Yorkers. ``Sen. D'Amato has consistently laid out his plans and his
positions on the issues, and Chuck Schumer has consistently
attempted to evade them,'' Mahoney said. ``And I don't blame him.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, several analysts noted, as a matter of politics, it
was in D'Amato's interest to avoid discussing many issues in this
campaign _ as he has in past campaigns _ because some of his views
are not in keeping with those of most New Yorkers. For almost all
of October, D'Amato built his campaign around attacking Schumer for
missing votes while he was running for Senate _ a line of attack he
has moved away from after the disclosure that he did the same thing
when he first ran for Senate in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   By design or not, D'Amato's emphasis on those attacks meant that
he tended not to discuss some of the differences he has with
Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   And Saturday, D'Amato repeatedly suggested that New Yorkers look
beyond his views and instead consider his record and seniority as a
member of the majority party in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to carry this campaign to every region letting
them know I make a difference in their live, that I've been
fighting for them,'' D'Amato said at the Nassau Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has sought to exploit some issues on which D'Amato might
be vulnerable: For example, he has attacked the senator for
opposing gun control and abortion rights, and for supporting
measures pushed by House Speaker Newt Gingrich that would have
resulted in cuts in social spending programs, including education
and Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But Schumer's campaign has been built around an effort to
question D'Amato's character _ ``Too many lies for too long'' _ and
through the last weekend, it continued to pound D'Amato with
advertisements questioning his ethics.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato last week raised a 1980 investigation into whether
Schumer used state workers for his first congressional campaign _
he was never charged with any wrongdoing. Schumer responded with an
advertisement that is hard-hitting even by the standards of this
campaign: assailing D'Amato ethics by recounting, with the use of
newspaper headlines, virtually every question that has ever been
raised about his ethics, including the time he was faulted by the
Senate Ethics Committee for allowing his brother, Armand, to use
the senator's stationery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desperate Al D'Amato just won't stop his negative attacks and
distortion,'' the announcer says. ``Now, D'Amato, the most
investigated senator in New York, who was rebuked by the Senate
ethics committee, who has a 30-year pattern of ethical
transgressions, who has embarrassed us again and again, is dredging
up 18-year-old charges against Chuck Schumer.''
</P>
<P>
   The advertisements were very much in keeping with what has been
the strategy of his campaign this whole fall: To let none of
D'Amato's attacks go unanswered.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHEN A TOUGH GUY FEELS FEAR, HE HAS TO STRIKE
OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there is a definition of political panic, it's Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y., running ads attacking an opponent for ethics
violations. At a time in the election cycle when most candidates
are reverting to warm and fuzzy pictures of their families, D'Amato
has decided to bring up an 18-year-old charge that his opponent,
Rep. Charles Schumer, once put members of his Assembly staff to
work on his first congressional campaign.
</P>
<P>
   This is like the pot calling the kettle a pot. Any
half-conscious voter who hears talk about politicians' misusing
their offices cannot help but recall D'Amato's old connection to a
Nassau County kickback scheme or his brother Armand's writing
letters on behalf of a lobbying client on the senator's official
stationery.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the Puerto Rican developer who was charged with
illegally funneling campaign contributions to D'Amato, and the
Senate Ethics Committee investigation into said contributions that
was stymied when nearly half the witnesses decided to plead the
Fifth. There was also the miraculous one-day profit of $37,125 that
D'Amato made on stock trades handled by a much-investigated
securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   None of these misadventures led to criminal convictions, and
Schumer's legal problems had an equally quiet ending. A Justice
Department official named Rudolph Giuliani rejected the idea of
indicting D'Amato. (Giuliani later became a friend of D'Amato, then
an enemy of D'Amato and then a political ally. Truly, there are
only four people in this world, and three of them are now the mayor
of New York.)
</P>
<P>
   Since D'Amato has a dozen fishy stories in his background for
Schumer's one, unleashing the ethics genie has to be one of the
more peculiar political tactics of this election year, right up
there with the decision by a California Senate candidate, Matt
Fong, to have his mom go on television and tell Barbara Boxer to
stop picking on her son.
</P>
<P>
   But this has not been a great campaign for D'Amato. His early
assaults on Schumer as a liberal fell flat. The main effect of his
attempts to depict the Brooklyn congressman as an urban enemy of
agriculture was that Schumer began wearing plaid shirts in his
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Mid-campaign, the senator hit on what looked like a more
promising tactic, hammering away at Schumer's House attendance
record. D'Amato worked that vein to the point of parody, and voters
might well have inferred that he was running for re-election solely
because his opponent failed to show up for a routine vote on safe
mammogram equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer was clearly thrown off stride, until he discovered how
many noncritical but nonetheless resonant votes on the Nassau
County Board of Supervisors D'Amato missed in 1980 when he was
first running for the Senate. (``Votes to Protect Seniors and
Domestic Violence Victims!!!'')
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, D'Amato had forgotten the most basic rule of modern
campaigning, which is that the candidate must begin by searching
his soul for sins on which the opposition could capitalize, and
admit them first.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome on Tuesday, one result of this race has
been to deflate the senator's reputation as a killer campaigner.
The truth is that D'Amato has made his career by running against
different variations of a political marshmallow.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee six years ago was Attorney General Robert
Abrams, a sweet man with the killer instincts of a hamster. The
time before that, D'Amato's opponent was Mark Green, whose campaign
had about as much money as a Russian pensioner. Meanwhile, between
races, he forged nonaggression pacts against high-profile Democrats
with sharp tongues, like Edward Koch and Mario Cuomo.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato's first big race, the one that made his reputation, was
the 1980 campaign against Sen. Jacob Javits and Rep. Elizabeth
Holtzman. He won the Republican primary against Javits with an
infamous campaign in which he depicted Javits as an aging
politician in poor health. That created the legend of Al D'Amato
the ferocious attack dog.
</P>
<P>
   But Javits actually was in ill health, suffering from a fatal
degenerative disease that took his life before the next Senate term
was up. Ms. Holtzman was a woman of many fine qualities, none of
which involved being a likable politician. In the end, with Javits
running on the Liberal line, D'Amato beat Holtzman with 45 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   As a campaigner, D'Amato's real strength is his shamelessness _
he would take credit for the tide coming in _ and his desperation.
He gives the distinct impression that he would do anything for a
vote, change his ideology, make funny faces, clean out your cellar.
</P>
<P>
   It is an unnerving, but rather compelling quality for New York
voters, whose normal electoral choices involve a phlegmatic
incumbent and a sacrificial-lamb opponent who is possibly under
indictment or living in a different state. But Schumer, who would
walk a mile barefoot to do a two-minute interview with a 100-watt
radio station, is right up in D'Amato's league when it comes to
manic self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The senator specializes in surprise last-minute surges in
popularity, perhaps from supporters too embarrassed to tell
pollsters they plan to vote for a man whose most memorable campaign
quote was ``putzhead.'' But the fact that D'Amato is harping on
Schumer's antique ethics charge at this late hour suggests he is
worried that the hidden D'Amato voters might not surface this year.

ADM. JOHN HYLAND, 86, WHO CHAMPIONED NAVAL AIR POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Hawaii, Pa.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adm. John Joseph Hyland Jr., a veteran test pilot and champion
of naval air power who commanded the U.S. armada off Indochina at
the height of the Vietnam War, died Oct. 25 at a hospice in
Honolulu. He was 86 and lived in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   President Lyndon B. Johnson went over the heads of 72 rear
admirals senior to Hyland by naming him commander of the 7th Fleet
at the end of 1965, with a promotion to vice admiral. The choice
reflected Hyland's long experience with carrier-based aerial combat
and the president's campaign to bomb North Vietnam into submission.
</P>
<P>
   The 7th Fleet was heavily involved in providing cover and
support for U.S. ground troops in the Vietnam War. To sap Vietcong
supply lines, the fleet in 1967 mined North Vietnamese rivers from
the air and shelled roads in North Vietnam from cruisers and
destroyers just offshore.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1967, Johnson promoted Hyland to commander in chief
of the Pacific Fleet, in Honolulu. The admiral also received his
fourth star and a Distinguished Service Medal for ``outstanding
leadership, astute judgment and foresight in directing the complex
and manifold operations of the 7th Fleet in support of our national
objectives in the Western Pacific.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``Navy brat,'' Hyland was born in Philadelphia and graduated
from the Naval Academy in 1934. He completed training as a naval
aviator in 1937, and, with the outbreak of World War II, was
assigned to patrol duty in the Philippines and the Netherlands East
Indies and in the retreat to Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hyland won the Distinguished Flying Cross for ``extraordinary
flying achievement'' and heroism in the rescue of a downed British
flyer in the Malucca Sea in 1942. He served for 16 months as the
personal pilot of the chief of naval operations, Adm. Ernest King.
</P>
<P>
   As commander of an air group on the carrier Intrepid, Hyland was
awarded a Silver Star, a fourth Air Medal and a second
Distinguished Flying Cross. The citations describe his leadership
and courage during low-level combat raids and the final missions
over the Japanese home islands at the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Hyland did two stints as a test pilot in the late 1940s and
1950s before taking command of the carrier Saratoga. Just before
assuming his duties at the Strategic Plans Division in Washington,
he commanded a carrier task force.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Pacific Fleet, Hyland played central roles in two
painful episodes in the Navy's history: the investigations of the
capture and detention by North Korean patrol boats of the
intelligence ship Pueblo in January 1968, and the explosion that
killed and maimed scores of sailors aboard the carrier Enterprise
during bombing practice just months later.
</P>
<P>
   He retired on Jan. 1, 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Hyland is survived by two sons, John III and Whiting; two
daughters, Nancy Arnold and Pamela Hyland; seven grandchildren and
two great-grandchildren. His wife, Florence Whiting Hyland, died in
1991 after 53 years of marriage.

ABSENCE OF BASKETBALL IS A WINDOW FOR HOCKEY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., N.Y., Calif., Mich.)   (jw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Four short years ago, hockey was hot. The Rangers won the
Stanley Cup and rap artists wore National Hockey League jerseys,
even if they couldn't name many players.
</P>
<P>
   National sports magazines and business publications proclaimed
the ascendancy of the NHL, comparing its growth potential to that
of the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   That October, when baseball's playoffs and World Series were
canceled by a strike, hockey's position seemed even better. With
basketball's season still five weeks away and football's playoffs
months in the future, the NHL had a window of opportunity to
attract new fans, at least on television, and to lure the news
media. And how did hockey's team owners and commissioner handle
this good fortune?
</P>
<P>
   By going to war with the players union in a 15-week lockout that
created fan resentment and reams of negative publicity before a
half-season finally started in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Four seasons later, the NHL appears to face another opportunity.
This time the NBA season, scheduled to begin this week, has been
postponed by a lockout. With the baseball season over, hockey
shares the professional stage with only football, whose teams play
once a week. The NBA shares months, markets and even some arenas
with the NHL. Might basketball's loss be hockey's gain? Will
television cameras find the celebrity basketball buffs Spike Lee
and Jack Nicholson in the front row, behind the glass, supporting
the Rangers and the Los Angeles Kings?
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath. According to hockey, basketball and
television executives interviewed for this article, there is not a
great overlap between the two sports' audiences, and if the lockout
drives NBA fans elsewhere, the beneficiary might be college
basketball.
</P>
<P>
   There could be more exposure for hockey, at least temporarily,
in some newspapers and magazines as well as on the nightly
highlights, they said. But even the official word from the NHL is
that a labor lockout in one sport is bad for all sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the bus goes through the puddle, everybody gets
splashed,'' said Stephen Solomon, senior vice president and chief
operating officer of the NHL. ``I don't relish any sport having
these kinds of problems. When they occur, the entire industry is
adversely affected.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Solomon and his staff have revived the NHL's
``Game On'' advertising campaign that was used to herald the end of
the lockout four seasons ago. Although ``Game On'' subtly suggests
that hockey is being played while other sports might not be, the
league said the campaign was set before the basketball lockout,
which has wiped out all November NBA games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've resurrected it because it gave us an opportunity to tell
our fans that our season has started,'' Solomon said. ``How fans
interpret it is up to them.''
</P>
<P>
   The NHL has no plans to add more games on ESPN, ESPN2 or the Fox
network, Solomon said. But he spoke about a number of initiatives _
including the ``Game On'' campaign, stable television exposure and
new rules changes designed to increase the flow and pace of games _
and added, ``We're feeling very good about the way we are
positioned for this season.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey's television ratings, which slumped badly in 1997-98,
have improved in the first month of this season and revenues will
rise next season from a new network contract. But while the sport
continues to expand in the Sun Belt, one established northern
franchise _ Pittsburgh _ recently filed for bankruptcy. And
although many teams are moving into new arenas, one club _ the
Islanders _ recently tried to break its lease, charging that its
building was unsafe and too old. Among these mixed signals, the
pecking order has not changed: Hockey still trails baseball,
football and basketball among the major team sports.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon said research has given his office ``a pretty good
handle'' on the viewing habits of those sports' fans. ``There is
some crossover between NBA and NHL fans,'' he said. ``But there is
more crossover between NHL fans and NFL fans.'' Does that mean
hockey will draw few NBA fans looking for game action this month?
``It's hard to judge,'' Solomon said. ``Our research has not probed
deep enough to give us that answer because it is always assumed
that the NBA product is available.''
</P>
<P>
   A more optimistic prediction from a hockey perspective came from
Arthur Smith, executive vice president for programming and
production at Fox Sports Net, the confederation of 22 regional
cable systems that controls local television rights to the majority
of hockey, basketball and baseball teams. Smith, like Solomon, said
everyone would be better off with the NBA in action. But he added
that ``hockey could benefit, positively, in terms of the ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense, if you think about it,'' Smith said. ``People
who just need a fix of a game and want to see a game, without an
NBA game available, they may choose hockey. But it is very
difficult to speculate.''

</P>
<P>
   One observer with experience as both an NBA executive and NHL
consultant suggested that dollars spent on sports, and hours spent
watching them, do not necessarily stay in sports at all when one
league shuts down.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can spend it on going out to dinner or going to Hawaii,''
said Jon Spoelstra, a former president of the Nets, who now
publishes Success magazine and works as a consultant to sports
franchises. ``The same thing with sponsors. There's a lot of
different places they can spend their money. That money is gone,
it's gone for good.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that teams compete not just with those in other sports
but also ``with every deli, every dry cleaners, every travel
service and so forth.''
</P>
<P>
   As for hockey's stealing basketball's audience, Spoelstra said:
``There is some crossover, but I don't see a big benefit for the
NHL If the NBA went out for a year, and if they canceled the
season, maybe. But not substantive. When the NHL was missing games,
I don't think there was a spike for the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoelstra, who recently worked as a consultant for the Edmonton
Oilers as they raised their season-ticket base from 5,500 to
13,000, said his studies of both sports showed that hockey
attracted more individual season ticket-holders than basketball,
which sold more subscriptions to corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Wilson, the president of the NBA's Detroit Pistons, said he
noticed no increase in basketball interest in his market during the
hockey lockout, in one of the NHL's oldest strongholds. But the NHL
lockout helped minor league hockey, he said, particularly in his
arena, the Palace of Auburn Hills, where Wilson then was
establishing the Detroit Vipers of the International Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a terrific thing to help us get established in the
IHL,'' Wilson said. ``So hockey really impacted hockey in those
rare cities like Detroit and Chicago that had two leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   This sort of fan migration, from the major league to a less
elite level in the same sport, might occur in the basketball
lockout, according to Dick Glover, executive vice president for
programming at ESPN. Glover's network is the national cable outlet
for the NHL and also carries a heavy menu of college basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were to be any single programming beneficiary, it
would more likely be college basketball than anything else,''
Glover said.
</P>
<P>
   If there is an impact on hockey, it may show up in the hours of
sports news programming ESPN and other networks carry every day. It
is possible, according to Solomon of the NHL, that shows like
ESPN's ``Sportscenter'' as well as newspapers and magazines will
increase their hockey content or at least position it more
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Goodenow, the executive director of the NHL Players
Association, said his hunch was that ``basketball fans are
basketball fans and hockey fans are hockey fans'' and that the
impact at the box office would be small.
</P>
<P>
   One fan who follows both sports is Brian Leetch, the Rangers'
captain. When asked about the impact of an NBA lockout on hockey
and in general, Leetch replied: ``I don't miss the regular season
much. I like the NBA playoffs. So, as long as they get it back. . .

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ For the first time in a pro football life
that would harden the heart of most quarterbacks, a mellow Vinny
Testaverde will take the field here Sunday undefeated and ranked by
any measure as one of the top quarterbacks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   He is 4-0 as the Jets' starter, with 11 touchdown passes and
just one interception. Statistically, he is the most dangerous
quarterback in the American Conference inside the red zone, the
most effective on fourth down, the second-best on third down.
</P>
<P>
   Yet how much should be made of this after only four games,
especially considering the history of unrealized potential that
Testaverde also will be carrying into the noisy atmosphere at
Arrowhead Stadium?
</P>
<P>
   Coming into this season, his career record as a starting
quarterback was 48-83-1, a painfully low winning percentage of .367
_ not the kind of performance expected of a player who emerged from
college as the Heisman Trophy winner and the overall No. 1 draft
choice in the National Football League in 1987. The team that
drafted him, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, gave up on him and so did
the Baltimore Ravens after last season.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of how far expectations had fallen, the Jets signed
him as the presumed backup to Glenn Foley. It was only Foley's
injuries and ineffectiveness that turned Testaverde into the
starter, but now, two weeks from his 35th birthday, he is playing
the way it always seemed he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had one flaw in most of his career, it was that he
didn't look at the whole field,'' said an NFL front-office official
who asked not to be identified. ``He'd be forcing the ball. Now, he
seems to know that about himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, any and all receivers are targets. Keyshawn Johnson and
Dedric Ward downfield. Wayne Chrebet across the middle. Curtis
Martin or Leon Johnson flaring out of the backfield. Keith Byars or
Kyle Brady floating into the flat.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde completed passes to seven players in last Sunday's
28-3 thrashing of the Atlanta Falcons that improved the Jets'
record to 4-3. He hit nine receivers in the previous Monday night's
24-14 upset of the New England Patriots. In his four starts and one
relief appearance before he became the starter, he has completed
passes to 11 players. His 11 touchdown passes have gone to six
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't go back to when the kid was 21,'' coach Bill Parcells
said. ``Now I think he likes our system. The systems he used to be
in primarily used three receivers. It was a down-the-field passing
attack. We have people who can run the ball. Through most of his
career he's been trying to sling the ball to his wide receivers.
And when I was watching films of his past games, I told him many of
his problems came when he was on the run.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellingly, Sunday will be the first time in Testaverde's
12-season career that he will enter a game having thrown more
touchdown passes than interceptions, with 186 touchdowns to 184
interceptions. He has been trying to get on the positive side of
that benchmark statistic since the second game of his career, when
he threw his first interception. He finally did it when he threw
two touchdown passes and no interceptions against the Falcons last
Sunday in his 136th game as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus two, right?'' he said after the victory. True, but what a
tortuous route along the way.
</P>
<P>
   The burden to produce has been with Testaverde since the day he
was drafted. Minutes after the Bucs selected him, they traded away
a quarterback named Steve Young. The Bucs were certain they had
their future in the strong-armed, 6-foot-5-inch Testaverde, and so
Young was unloaded to the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   Not many quarterbacks can carry a team by themselves, though. At
the University of Miami, Testaverde was surrounded by future NFL
players whom he led to a 21-1 record in two years as a starter.
When he joined the Buccaneers, though, victories were much harder
to come by.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's trying to explain what happened when he was
younger,'' said Jets quarterback coach Dan Henning, who had his own
simple explanation for it: ``He went with a team that was awful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bucs never won more than six games in any of Testaverde's
six seasons, but despite their many flaws, more attention was paid
to Testaverde's than his team's. In part he was followed by the
lingering image of the five interceptions he threw in his final
game as a collegian, when his top-ranked Miami team was upset by
Penn State; in part it was because he did nothing to erase that
memory by throwing 81 interceptions in his first 49 games in the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were building, we didn't have a very good club,'' said his
first coach with the Buccaneers, Ray Perkins. ``We didn't have a
lot of good people. When you're playing with teams that aren't
doing well, some competitive quarterbacks have enough confidence in
themselves they can put a ball somewhere, force it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve DeBerg, the starter Testaverde replaced at Tampa Bay, said
it is important to understand what Testaverde was going through.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense is giving up a lot of points, you feel that
throwing 6-yard routes to the backs isn't doing it enough,'' DeBerg
said. ``You've got to score real fast because the other team is
doing that. You develop some thick skin as a quarterback, because
you get criticized for a lot of things that aren't your fault. I
give him a lot of credit. He never really finger-pointed.''
</P>
<P>
   He certainly could have. In four games with the Jets, he has
already seen more 100-yard rushing performances than he did in his
first two seasons with Tampa Bay. As much as he was criticized for
throwing 112 interceptions and only 77 touchdown passes in his six
seasons with Tampa Bay, it wasn't until his final year there that
he had a 1,000-yard running back to support him.
</P>
<P>
   By that time the atmosphere in Tampa Bay had gone stale. The
Buccaneers decided not to re-sign him and in 1993 he moved on to
Cleveland, where coach Bill Belichick anointed him to replace the
entrenched Bernie Kosar in what was to become the overriding
controversy of Belichick's regime.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet Testaverde's football life began to change for the better.
He produced his first plus season in touchdowns, throwing 14 and
only nine interceptions. The next season became his first winning
campaign when the Browns went 11-5 and made the playoffs as a
wild-card team. He and the Browns defeated a Parcells-coached
Patriots team, 20-13, but then lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers,
29-9, in a game in which Testaverde completed only 13 of 31 passes
and threw two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, word leaked out that the team was leaving for
Baltimore. The season ended disastrously, with a 5-11 record and
the firing of Belichick. Testaverde's statistics were respectable,
though, with 17 touchdowns and 10 interceptions, and his resurgence
continued in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   Playing under a new coach, Ted Marchibroda, he put together his
best season, passing for 4,177 yards and 33 touchdowns with 19
interceptions. He went to the Pro Bowl despite the team's 4-12
record. But the Ravens were also an unsettled team. After a 6-9-1
season last year, Testaverde's contract was up and so was his stay
there.
</P>
<P>
   Before Testaverde became a Jet, Parcells studied him on tape. He
knew he had to give Testaverde delivery options he never had
before.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde said Parcells encouraged him to consider other
options beyond the wide receivers: ``Bill told me all through camp:
`Use your backs more. They can catch the ball.'''
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most important, Testaverde doesn't have to do it
just with his arm. He can hand the ball to Curtis Martin, who has
rushed for more than 100 yards in each of Testaverde's starts.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has been especially happy about Testaverde's
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   In the Monday night victory at New England, Parcells said: ``He
had nine pivotal choices _ do something good, something awful,
something to negate a bad situation. Vinny made the right choice
seven times.''
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's victory against the Falcons, Parcells said: ``Vinny
only had three minuses on 65 plays. On the gradeable plays Vinny
was involved with, there were only three minuses, so that's pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to approach every day the same way,'' Testaverde said.
``Two years ago with Baltimore, I had to make plays offensively.
See, I'm not going to force a third-and-10 pass that might get
picked off.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde's only interception in 132 attempts this season came
on the last play of the first half in a blowout victory against the
Indianapolis Colts. It was a long pass thrown on the off-chance the
Jets would get lucky and score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Vinny's skills diminished at all,'' said
Perkins, his old coach at Tampa Bay. ``He's playing with some
pretty good people right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde concurred, crediting his cast of receivers for much
of his success. ``As a group _ this is the best I've ever been
around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the spotlight that was thrown on Testaverde's
poor early touchdown-to-interception ratio, it is easy to overlook
that in his last five seasons, Testaverde has consistently been on
the positive side of that statistic, with 98 touchdowns to 71
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   It's worth noting, too, that a quarterback should be judged on
more than his statistics. Joe Namath, for example, had only two
seasons in which touchdowns outnumbered interceptions. If
Testaverde can continue producing victories, no one will care what
his numbers are.
</P>
<P>
   Around the league, there is still plenty of respect for
Testaverde's talent.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Packers general manager Ron Wolf about Testaverde, who faced
Green Bay twice a year when he played with the Bucs, and Wolf
recalls with awe a 1992 performance. ``He completed 22 of 25
passes, and the three he didn't hit were dropped balls,'' Wolf
said. ``I know we wanted him when he became a free agent in 1993,
but he wanted to be a starter and we had Brett Favre.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any question about his passing
ability,'' Marchibroda said. ``I remember the first time going over
film and I said to him, `This is how we prepare for a ball game.'
He told me, `Coach, this is the first time anyone ever told me how
to watch film.' That was an unusual thing _ that may have had
something to do with earlier problems.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Testaverde is surrounded by a support system of
people who care for him and put him in comfortable situations on
and off the field. He is back home, living not far from the house
in Elmont, N.Y., where he grew up with Namath's picture on his
bedroom wall. His football advisers include Belichick, now the Jets
defensive coordinator; Scott Pioli, the pro personnel director who
became his friend in Cleveland, and Henning, the quarterbacks coach
who likes his attention to detail, his no-excuses attitude and an
arm he contends is unmatched in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put him in with a Namath and a Bartkowski in terms of
accuracy,'' Henning said, referring to the legendary Jet
quarterback and the former Atlanta Falcons star Steve Bartkowski.
``He is very meticulous in his studies.''
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, Testaverde has become a significant Jet. In typical
fashion, he showed his appreciation last week. With no fanfare he
had portable stereos delivered to his offensive linemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who sent this?'' asked one.
</P>
<P>
   He should not be surprised any longer.

PROSECUTORS BAR LEWINSKY FROM TALKING TO REPORTERS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following weeks of fruitless negotiations, aides to
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr recently told lawyers for Monica
Lewinsky that she is not allowed to talk to any reporters about any
aspects of the investigation of her relationship with President
Clinton, lawyers and others involved in the inquiry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In an immunity deal she signed with prosecutors last summer, Ms.
Lewinsky agreed that she would not speak to any news organizations
while the inquiry was proceeding without the consent of the
independent counsel. A friend of Ms. Lewinsky's, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, said that earlier last week the independent
counsel's office had imposed broad restrictions that made it
difficult for her to grant any interviews, even those that have
nothing to do with the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But others involved in the discussions said that the independent
counsel had not entirely closed the door to any interviews,
although he had forbidden her from talking publicly about the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Saturday that ABC News was poised
to interview Ms. Lewinsky. Citing unidentified sources, The Post
said ABC television network executives were awaiting word from
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has been shopping her story to various book
publishers and others but has not reached any deals, said people
involved in those discussions. She has not chosen from among scores
of news organizations to tell her story and has not presented any
formal proposal to the independent counsel's office, people
involved in the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   While some members of Ms. Lewinsky's family were described as
being unhappy with the conditions imposed upon her by the
independent counsel, other lawyers following the inquiry said those
conditions were normal for a high-profile case. They said that it
is typical in such cases to keep important witnesses from talking
publicly before the conclusion of such an inquiry so as not to
taint it by conflicting comments or revealing statements that could
tip off other witnesses to elements of her account that may not
have become public yet.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions between Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers and the Oprah Winfrey
show fell apart, and most of the major news organizations and
networks have put in requests to interview Ms. Lewinsky.

 &HT;    INTERNET WEB SITE CALLS IMPEACHMENT RALLY
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Summoned through cyberspace, protesters from across
America gathered at the base of the Washington Monument on Saturday
to chant and cheer and wave cigars and call for the impeachment of
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Freepers,'' the estimated 2,000 demonstrators were
organized through the Free Republic Website on the Internet
(www.freerepublic.com) and traveled on a shared online trust that
their chatroom comrades _ often known only by Internet handles _
would also show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason I came here is that I'm flat fed up,'' explained
Earl T. Koske, Jr., from Conroe, Texas, and known as
``Muffalettaman'' to his fellow ``Freepers.'' He said he flew to
the rally ``as sort of a Christmas present to myself'' and as a
representative of ``about 80 people in my family'' with similar
anti-Clinton views.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came to send a message that we don't like what's going
on,'' said Mark Granger, who drove from Marietta, Ga., with his
wife and two sons. Granger said he is ``frustrated'' that the
``mainstream media'' seem to ignore the opinions of people like
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to go on the Internet to find real news,'' said Mark, a
Freeper from Gainesville, Fla., who declined to give his full name.
``The newspapers and network TV don't know the truth any more than
Bill Clinton does.''
</P>
<P>
   The nation's founding fathers would have approved how ``this new
medium of the Internet'' is being used to ``educate, inform and
motivate people to become involved in government,'' said Rep. Bob
Barr, R-Ga., a member of the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In this raucous crowd of Clinton opponents, Barr was greeted
like a rock star. People put down their placards and lined up to
ask for autographs and pose with the Georgian who has led the
congressional calls for an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let him (Clinton) hear it,'' encouraged Barr as the crowd
changed ``Impeach. Impeach. Impeach.''
</P>
<P>
   Introduced as ``the godmother of Monicagate,'' Lucianne Goldberg
called the crowd ``a great group of Americans. They're not bankers
in three-piece suits but hard-working middle Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg, the New York literary agent consulted by Linda Tripp
about the secretly taped conversations revealing Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky, has an Internet name of ``Trixie'' _ from
accusations that she was a dirty trickster for Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a personal thing for me because this group has been
very, very supportive of Linda Tripp,'' said Goldberg. ``Without my
beloved Freepers, we could not have gotten through this ordeal.''
</P>
<P>
   On a windy, sunny afternoon, the mood was more humor than anger.
Someone in a cigar costume danced in front of the stage. People in
convict suits and Clinton masks meandered around. Signs quoted
``Ray Charles _ Tell Your Mama. Tell Your Pa. Gonna Send You Back
to Arkansas'' and alluded to the O.J. trial ``The Mess on the Dress
Sez You Must Confess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Crawl back under your Little Rock,'' said one sign. `` ... and
the donkey you rode in on,'' exclaimed a banner. ``Democrats _
Party of Enablers,'' said one placard.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the crowd was partisan and anxious to vote on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to vote straight Republican for the first time in my
life,'' said Susan Sprague of Attleboro, Ma. ``Clinton has got to
go. Our freedom is in dire danger as long as he is in office.''
</P>
<P>
   The speakers included a Who's Who of anti-Clintonites. Gary
Aldrich, the former FBI agent who wrote ``Unlimited Access;'' Larry
Klayman, president of Judicial Watch; L.D. Brown, a former Arkansas
state trooper; Alan Keyes, the former U.N. Ambassador and
conservative commentator, and; Ann Coulter, a conservative
commentator and author of a book calling for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The movement is just getting started, the speakers promised.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the words of our greatest president, Ronald Reagan, 'you
ain't seen nothing yet','' said Klayman, and the ``Freepers''
cheered even more.

GOOD NEWS FOR RUTGERS: CROOKS GOES ON THE RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PISCATAWAY, N.J. _ Jacki Crooks did not look like a man who
should share playing time Saturday at Rutgers Stadium. With his
legs churning, his hips shifting and his body spinning, Crooks
displayed the skills of a featured runner, a 30-carries-a-game
back.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing this, coach Terry Shea scrapped his plans to platoon
halfbacks and gave Crooks the opportunity to be the showcase. The
Rutgers junior responded with a touchdown and career highs of 159
yards on 32 carries, leading the Scarlet Knights to a 21-10 victory
over their Big East rival Temple.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, Rutgers' seventh in its last eight meetings with
Temple, improved the Knights' record to 4-4, giving them their best
mark this late in the season since 1994. It also moved them to 2-3
in the conference, dropped Temple to 1-7 and 1-3, and proved that
the Owls' 28-24 upset of nationally ranked Virginia Tech two weeks
ago was an aberration.
</P>
<P>
   A first-stringer a year ago, Crooks splits starts and carries
this season with the redshirt freshman Dennis Thomas. The system
had left Crooks, who ran for more than 100 yards three times as a
sophomore, with single-game highs of 11 carries and 68 yards this
year. But early Saturday, Crooks' hard running and pinpoint dodging
made it clear that this was his afternoon. That being the case,
Shea sat Thomas down.
</P>
<P>
   By enlivening Rutgers' offense with 88 yards on 14 carries in
the first half, Crooks forced Temple's defenders to focus more on
the run after intermission and thereby opened things up for
quarterback Mike McMahon. McMahon, four for 15 passing for 43 yards
at the half, completed seven of 11 second-half tosses for 111 yards
and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon's touchdown, a 10-yard bullet that split two defenders
before landing in Tosh Riddick's hands, gave the Knights a 12-10
lead midway through the third quarter and set the tone for the rest
of the game. The score was set up moments earlier when Rutgers
tackle Mike Belh pounced on a fumbled pitch by Temple's Carlos
Johnson at the Owls' 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Knights completed the scoring with Steven Barone's third
field goal, a 32-yarder early in the fourth quarter, and Crooks'
2-yard touchdown run that was set up by a 47-yard pass from McMahon
to Jermaine Robinson in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Things were dull through a first quarter that included seven
punts and saw neither team move within 37 yards of the opponent's
goal line. But on its opening possession of the second quarter,
Rutgers' offense awoke to put the game's first points on the board.
</P>
<P>
   With Crooks rambling for good yardage, the Knights marched 58
yards on 13 plays over five minutes to set up a 48-yard field goal
attempt by Barone. A freshman, Barone converted the kick, posting a
career high for distance on his fifth straight boot this year.
</P>
<P>
   If Rutgers thought it had the momentum, it was mistaken as
Temple, seemingly charged by the challenge, answered immediately.
The freshman quarterback Devin Scott, who was magnificent in
passing for two touchdowns and running for another against Virginia
Tech, opened the ensuing drive with a 17-yard keeper to the Rutgers
46-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Scott slipped through an attempted arm tackle
and sprinted 25 yards to the Knights' 20. Scott fumbled upon
contact and, though he recovered, was pulled by coach Bobby Wallace
in favor of the backup Mac DeVito. Another freshman, DeVito scored
moments later on a 10-yard option to put the Owls up by 7-3 with 3
minutes 17 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers, behind two McMahon passes for 26 yards, responded with
a 56-yard drive to set up a 32-yard field goal by Barone at the
1:22 mark. Hoping to head into the locker room trailing by a point,
the Knights instead were blitzkrieged over the final minute by runs
of 39 and 19 yards by halfback Stacey Mack and a 19-yard completion
from Scott to Rahsaan Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Temple had the ball at the Rutgers 2-yard line with 12
seconds remaining. Finally, the Knights' defense stiffened, holding
Scott to no gain on a keeper and forcing the Owls to settle for a
field goal, which gave them a 10-6 halftime lead.

VILLANOVA ROUTS FORDHAM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Barring a tie, one thing was certain when Fordham met
Villanova at Jack Coffey Field in the Bronx Saturday: One team
would end its three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   It was Villanova that put an end to a month without a victory _
after winning three of its first four games _ by routing Fordham,
45-12, for its 10th straight victory over the Rams. The Wildcats
evened their record at 4-4 behind Chris Boden, who threw five
touchdown passes, and Brian Westbrook, who scored four times.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fordham (2-6) was relying on a third-string
quarterback who had thrown only five passes this season. Dan
Colonna, a junior, started only because of injuries to the starting
quarterback Steve O'Hare and his primary backup, Dan Madine. Also
missing from the Fordham lineup for the second straight week was
the team's second-leading runner, the injured Lance Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-9-inch Westbrook came into the game ranked first in
Division I-AA in all-purpose yards, second in receptions and third
in scoring. Fordham keyed on the sophomore tailback, but he scored
touchdowns on Villanova's first two possessions _ on pass plays of
11 and 57 yards. Overall, Westbrook ran 13 times for 112 yards,
caught five passes for 92 yards, ran back three punts for 16 yards
and gained 52 yards on two kickoff runbacks.

PENN STATE ACHIEVES ITS FIRST SHUTOUT IN 29 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RON DICKER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   STATE COLLEGE, Pa. _ The positive signs for Penn State from its
victory Saturday should come with an asterisk and the footnote:
``Played Illinois.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fighting Illini are as bad as that. They have 10 first-year
starters and an offense that poses a threat only to itself. The
Nittany Lions rose to the subdued occasion enough to record their
first shutout since 1996, a span of 29 games, 27-0, before 96,508
fans at Beaver Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The burnt oranges and golds covering the hills around Happy
Valley provided a pleasant distraction from the mismatch. The
stakes will jump a notch this week when the Lions, No. 10 in both
The New York Times computer ranking and The Associated Press poll,
visit Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions (6-1, 3-1 Big Ten) deserve credit for preventing
overconfidence from seeping into their execution. Quarterback Kevin
Thompson threw for a career-high 269 yards and a touchdown.
Receiver Chafie Fields had receptions of 47 and 53 yards to set up
touchdowns as Lions built a 21-0 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought our wideouts could get open,'' said coach Joe
Paterno.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois' ineptitude was evident from the first drive. Rocky
Harvey sprinted 53 yards with the kickoff to put the Illini (2-7,
1-5) at the Penn State 45-yard line. But two sacks by Penn State
and two Illinois offsides penalties later, the drive was over.
</P>
<P>
   It should have come as no shock. Illinois had scored a total of
12 points in its last three games and was 106th in the nation in
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Illini gave a stalled Penn State possession new life
with two more offsides penalties on the punt. Thompson capitalized
by throwing a 47-yard bomb into the cradling fingertips of Fields
at the Illinois 7. Aaron Harris bulled 2 yards standing up for the
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's defensive harassment quickly got the ball back for
the Lions. Thompson found Fields again on a 53-yard play to the 27.
On both long pass plays, Fields simply outran the secondary. After
a pass-interference call, the freshman running back Eric McCoo
picked his way on a sweep for a 2-yard touchdown and Penn State
took a 14-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinois response was three plays and a punt. The
linebacking trio of LaVar Arrington, Mac Morrison and Brandon
Short, and the defensive ends Brad Scioli and Courtney Brown took
turns harassing quarterback Kirk Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Illini rode bursts by Elmer Hickman and Steve Havard from
its 2 to the Penn State 40 but fizzled. On the Lions' next series,
Cordell Mitchell grabbed a shuttle pass from Thompson and raced 36
yards to the 11. Penn State scored on Thompson's 10-yard pass to
Corey Jones, who ran an out pattern in the left-front corner of the
end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ease with which Penn State won, one note of concern
emerged: The regular running backs produced little on the ground.
Mitchell had 50 yards on 15 tries; Harris managed just 8 yards on
four carries and McCoo, the freshman who rushed for 163 yards
against Purdue two weeks ago, stumbled to 6 yards on five carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions' defense, already one of the nation's toughest,
tightened even further Saturday. Fifth in the nation in scoring
defense entering the game (13.3 points), the Lions harassed Johnson
into an unproductive afternoon. He completed 13 of 26 passes for 91
yards and an interception. The Illini rushed for 122 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Arrington, a sophomore, had five tackles, two pass breakups and
a sack _ nothing extraordinary for the Butkus Award semifinalist.
But he made an eye-popping play in the first half to stop Illinois
on fourth down with the Illini, trailing by 21-0, at the Penn State
35. Arrington soared over a lineman to smash into running back
Elmer Hickman and stop him cold.

GIANTS DEFENSE IS FINDING ITS OLD, SWAGGERING STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The swagger went out of the New York Giants defense on Aug. 20
in a very public moment of vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   When Jason Sehorn jumped into the air to avoid a defender with
the opening kickoff on that warm evening at Giants Stadium, the
Giants defense was young and invincible.
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks at the team's summer training camp, they had
coalesced _ tackles, linebackers, safeties _ and it seemed nothing
could ever penetrate the will or the confidence forged by this
Giants defense.
</P>
<P>
   When Sehorn came down that night, his right knee bowing
awkwardly, the Giants defense buckled with him.
</P>
<P>
   It would be accurate, though not entirely fair, to say they
haven't been the same since. In fact, the 1998 Giants have done
more with less since Sehorn's injury. It just doesn't feel like it.
</P>
<P>
   Sehorn's loss was a punch to the heart, but it was just the
first of a series of body blows.
</P>
<P>
   While Sehorn's replacement Conrad Hamilton filled in ably, the
Giants defense in quick succession lost five other starters.
Linebacker Jessie Armstead, the catalyst to most of the chaos the
Giants created last year, was playing on one leg.
</P>
<P>
   Before they could learn to play without Sehorn, the Giants
defense was overwhelmed by other problems, which included an inept
offense that gave the opposition points and left the Giants defense
on the field forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants defense absorbed these hits like a boxer trapped in a
corner. But lately, it's as if the Giants defense has fought its
way out to the middle of the ring. Its head is clearing. The
swagger, so evident in summer training camp, is in rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' defense, which hopes to prey on winless Washington
on Sunday at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium, might seem less fearsome this
year than last year, but it might surprise Giants fans to know that
the production is remarkably similar.
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers are the currency of success for a National Football
League defense and last season's Giants hit the jackpot. Their
riches were greater than any in the league, with 44 take-aways in
16 games.
</P>
<P>
   But through seven games last season, the Giants defense had
produced 13 turnovers. They had 23 quarterback sacks, another
measure of a defense's disruptive influence.
</P>
<P>
   This year after seven games, the Giants defense has forced 15
turnovers. It has 30 sacks.
</P>
<P>
   As defensive coordinator John Fox said Friday: ``You don't
replace a Jason Sehorn. When you take a personality out of the
defense, the personality of the defense changes. There are new
voices and new faces. But I'm proud of what we've done. I'm not
proud of the results, which is a 3-4 record.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Giants are growing more defiant about the defense's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still standing here and we've got as good a chance at
winning our division as anyone,'' Armstead said. ``We haven't lost
anything we can't overcome. And we're healthier now. I hope all the
teams on our schedule think we've lost something. They'll be
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   There's some swagger in those words.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Armstead's sprained ankle has all but healed. Equally important,
his replacement and the team's vital nickel linebacker, Scott
Galyon, has overcome the Achilles heel soreness that kept him out
of three games.
</P>
<P>
   Galyon has become one of the Giants most valuable players. With
him on the field in passing situations, Armstead feels the freedom
to roam. And Armstead's best attribute is his football instincts,
which have been inhibited by injury and a lack of familiarity with
the players who filled in for Galyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take some chances because I know he'll cover for me,''
Armstead said of Galyon. ``We read off each other really well.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar dynamic seems to have evolved at defensive tackle.
Robert Harris recently missed three games with a chest injury, and
while his replacement Christian Peter played well, it was Harris'
counterpart at defensive tackle, Keith Hamilton, who seemed out of
sync. Just as Sehorn's substitute played well there was a
collective effect, a loss of cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   Harris returned against Arizona two weeks ago and recorded 2.5
sacks and a team-leading nine tackles. Hamilton was rejuvenated,
too, with 1.5 sacks and five tackles.
</P>
<P>
   These defensive pairings of players point to the importance of
chemistry within a team or a specific unit within a team.
</P>
<P>
   It took a few weeks to regroup from the loss of Sehorn, if not
recover. Then Armstead was hobbled. Then Harris. Then safety Sam
Garnes. Then cornerback Phillippi Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   All but Garnes and Sehorn are back now. It is a young defense,
one promising resilience. They are adjusting to their new selves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes have been as much mental as they've been
physical,'' Fox said last week. ``I think we're learning we can
play the same way. Even if we don't have all the same guys.''

Shouldn't be. The NFL product is terrible. We examine how salary
caps, free agency and other changes have turned the NFL into the

the Ugly (all the rest). (Pasquarelli, Atlanta

   w/FBN-NFLRATE _ TV dollars have made the NFL rich, but the happy
marriage may be in trouble in the first year of a record deal. NFL
ratings are way down, especially for Monday Night Football and the
NFC package on Fox. Ratings for the AFC, which was snatched away
from NBC by CBS this season, have remained steady. Because of the
low ratings, the networks may have to give rebates to advertisers.
The low ratings on Monday are interesting, because the games were
moved up to 8:20 p.m. in hopes of increasing viewership. (Rogers,

   ALTAMONTE SPRINGS, Fla. _ Gerrold Shropshire got up about dawn
most weekdays for the drive from his apartment near Orlando to his
job in an office he shared with his best friend.

   He passed strip malls and fast-food restaurants in a city where
half the AM radio stations broadcast in Spanish; crossed into

   After an hour or so, Shropshire arrived at work and took a seat
near Ronald Gutkowski, who lived in a retirement community far
removed from Shropshire's world. They spent their days together _
working, joking and chatting about sports in the office and over
lunch at a nearby Winn Dixie grocery store.
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire and Gutkowski were from different worlds, but their
friends and relatives say they paid little attention to differences
in skin color or religious affiliation. Shropshire was
African-American and a devote Baptist. Gutkowsi was a white
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was never any question of any barrier,'' said Alice
Gutkowski, Ronald's widow. ''We've always had friends of both
races.''
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire and Gutkowski were killed two weeks ago today in a
room on the 24th floor of the Atlanta Hilton &AMP; Towers in downtown
Atlanta. A business associate from Gainesville, Ga., 31-year-old
Phillip Dover, was also killed.
</P>
<P>
   A maid found the three men, each shot in the head more than once
at about 2:10 a.m. Investigators say they have worked long hours to
unravel the events leading to the mysterious triple murder.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the killings, Shropshire and Gutkowski were
supposed to be golfing partners in a tournamnet sponsored by their
employer, Lester Coggins Trucking.
</P>
<P>
   They were buried instead.
</P>
<P>
   Gutkowski, 51, was mourned in a quiet service at St. Paul's
Catholic Church in Leesburg, Fla., a city of 15,500 people about 40
miles north of Orlando. Shropshire, 50, was laid to rest after a
service that included a rousing sermon, a swaying choir and shouts
of ''Amen!'' and ''Yes, Jesus!'' from the congregation.
</P>
<P>
   The men's differences were obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire had lived in several apartments and houses in the
congested Orlando suburbs since the late 1980s. Gutkowski lived in
a house on Long Island, N.Y., for 21 years before moving to a gated
retirement community in a more rural Florida countryside dotted
with marshy lakes.
</P>
<P>
   They also had a lot in common _ both were middle-aged men with
children in their early 20s. Both worked for years in the trucking
industry and had lost jobs temporarily when their employers had
financial trouble. Both men went to church, stayed out of trouble,
were big sports fans and loved cooking and travel.
</P>
<P>
   They even went on a diet together.
</P>
<P>
   Maple Bronner, Shropshire's girlfriend, recalled the first time
she ever spoke with Gutkowski. She called the trucking office, but
Shropshire was out. The voice on the other end of the line had a
question.
</P>
<P>
   ''Are you Maple?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   She said yes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Oh, Gerrold talks about you all the time,'' Gutkowski told
her.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were just the best of friends,'' Bronner said. ''Ronnie
was after him all the time, trying to get him to move over there.''
</P>
<P>
   She said Gutkowski's relatives considered Shropshire ''part of
the family.'' And Alice Gutkowski said that on the rare ocassions
when the two men did not eat at Winn Dixie, they came to her house
for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were both honest, church-going men,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire was a founding member and deacon at New Covenant
Baptist Church, a church of nearly all black parishioners on 18
acres that were once a citrus grove in southern Orlando. The
congregation has swelled from 350 to more than 800 _ the goal is
2,500 _ since August 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Randolph Bracy Jr. said Shropshire volunteered to cook
barbecue for 300-400 people at a homeless shelter _ the church
provides meals to the homeless on the first Friday of every month.
Shropshire also counted collection money after most Sunday services
and sang in the choir at his church.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there was something in the church to be done, he would do
it,'' Bracy said. ''He was not just a Sunday member.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutkowski and his family went to mass ''whenever we were in
town,'' Alice Gutkowski said.
</P>
<P>
   He loved to cook clams and stuffed mushrooms as much as
Shropshire enjoyed grilling ribs or making crab legs.
</P>
<P>
   Shropshire and Gutkowski were ''key players'' at Lester Coggins
Trucking in Okahumpka, Fla., that employs about 500 people and
sends drivers to the 48 states in the continental U.S. ''It's a
tremendous loss for us, both personally and professionally,'' said
Dan Denhoff, the general manager of Lester Coggins.
</P>
<P>
   He said Shropshire and Gutkowski were scheduled to play in the
company's third annual golf tournament. The company has re-named
the tournament in honor of Shropshire and Gutkowski. Winners will
get a trophy with the men's name on it.
</P>
<P>
   Don Rulison, a Lester Coggins truck driver, said Shropshire and
Gutkowski were like ''50-year-old kids'' just before their trip to
see an Atlanta Falcons football game _ so excited that they did not
mind getting on the road by 4 a.m. so they could make the
eight-hour trip to Atlanta in time for some sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   Rulison and Joe Caldwell, who was a church deacon with
Shropshire, swapped stories about the men before Shropshire's
funeral Oct. 24. A drizzle forced mourners to duck under umbrellas
and jog from the parking lot, past the spot where Caldwell, who is
black, and Rulison, who is white, stood on a sidewalk, remembering
two men whose friendship overcame traditional obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   ''There wasn't a color barrier,'' Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Rulison nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ''Humanitarians are just people - they were just people,'' he
said. ''There were no barriers.''

   NEW YORK _ It was an unseasonably warm fall Saturday, but Imani
Webb had donned her Teflon coat. Impervious to indifference,
ignorance and outright hostility, she was spreading the word in the
Ingersoll Houses, a public housing project in Brooklyn, about an
unlikely road to salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come out and vote for the Working Families Party,'' she called
to one man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't vote,'' he said stonily.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the problem,'' she retorted.
</P>
<P>
   The party that Ms. Webb has made her cause was founded this year
by an alliance of labor unions, politicians, and the Association of
Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, an advocacy group
with low-income members. With Peter Vallone, the Democratic
candidate for governor, on its line as well, the party hopes to win
50,000 votes from union members, workfare recipients, immigrants,
the working poor and other traditionally liberal constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   If it succeeds, the party will have a place on the ballot in the
next election and some leverage over major-party candidates wanting
to run on its line. It won a line in this election by collecting
57,000 signatures, though only 15,000 were &UR;  &LR; required.
</P>
<P>
   New York State has a long history of minor parties with
influence disproportionate to their numbers, starting with the
Liberal Party in the 1930s and the Conservative Party in the 1960s.
In 1994, the Conservative Party gave George Pataki his margin of
victory &UR;  &LR; in the gubernatorial race, and the Right to Life Party
helped re-elect Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw all these parties pulling the debate toward the
interests of the wealthy, or Christian right, but no one was
pulling the debate toward working people or progressive ideas,''
said Bob Master, the political director for New York and New Jersey
of the Communications Workers of America and one of the party's
masterminds.
</P>
<P>
   Its supporters say that the Working Families Party has the
potential to energize apathetic or apolitical New Yorkers,
especially poor ones, and to keep issues like health care and a
living wage prominent on the Democratic agenda. And they point with
pride to their largely grass-roots campaign in an era of
advertising-driven candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   The party sometimes seems a coalition of competing interest
groups and goals, at least one of which seems to be avenging
personal grudges against both New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
and Raymond Harding, the chairman of the Liberal Party, which began
supporting Giuliani in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the new party's leading lights are David Dinkins, the
former mayor who lost to Giuliani in 1993; Sal Albanese, the former
city councilman who sought the Democratic nomination to challenge
Giuliani last year; and Ruth Messinger, the former Manhattan
borough president who won that chance and was soundly defeated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But past politics did not concern Ms. Webb; getting out the vote
did. The party does not have the money for television advertising
and has to rely on leaflets in English, Creole and Spanish, and on
e-mail, raucous rallies, phone banks and radio.
</P>
<P>
   It does have a means of getting out the vote in the several
hundred thousand members of its constituent unions, which include
the United Auto Workers and the Amalgamated Transit Union. But
because many union members are Republican, not registered or not
inclined to vote, it must reach beyond them.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Webb trooped up and down the graffiti-scarred and
trash-marred six-story buildings, attaching fliers to doorknobs and
talking to potential voters.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, her enthusiasm was challenged by the cold cloth
of self-interest. ``Oh, oh, Vallone, good guy,'' said a resident,
Maria George, 68. ``But what does he do for the senior citizens?
That's my topic.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Webb sighed. ``They always ask, `What can you do for me?' ''
she said. ``They never ask, `What can we do for ourselves?' '' She
believes that one of the things they can do for themselves is to
vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Working Families Party's formation started last year when
Albanese and the unions who had supported him saw that Pataki might
win re-election by a large margin. Masters said the unions wanted
to light a political fire in the bellies of their members, many of
whom were disappointed that Democrats did not fight harder against
the governor's 1995 budget cuts and his efforts to reduce workers'
compensation rates.
</P>
<P>
   If the unions are focused on statewide elections, others
involved in the new party are looking closer to home _ the next
mayoral election, and the 45 City Council seats that term limits
will open in the next few years. Bertha Lewis, a party
co-chairwoman and director of Brooklyn organizing for Acorn, said
the previous two mayoral races angered Acorn members. When several
Democrats on the City Council and in Congress supported Giuliani,
Ms. Lewis said, ``My membership was appalled.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dinkins, the new party sometimes seems to be in part a
vehicle for his long-running feud with Giuliani and the Liberal
Party's Harding. As part of his hope that fewer Democrats will be
drawn to the Liberal line in the future, the former mayor concluded
his speech at a Working Families Party rally last week by saying
that if the party wins a ballot line, ``We won't have to deal with
Ray Harding, thank God.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinkins said on Friday that the Liberal Party has strayed from
its roots. ``I don't intend to support anyone in the future who
runs on the Liberal Party line,'' he said, and implied that he
would not be upset if the Liberal Party failed to gain 50,000 votes
this year, which would knock it off the next ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Harding, in turn, said that Dinkins and others were
misinterpreting the Liberal Party's history. ``The idea that we
have served as some sort of left umbilical cord to the Democratic
Party is false _ it has never been the case,'' he said, referring
to the party's early motto to ``keep Republicans liberal and
Democrats honest'' and noting it had supported Republicans in the
past, citing Fiorello La Guardia and John Lindsay.
</P>
<P>
   Harding said he thought the Working Families Party would win
50,000 votes, but he said the Democratic Party is already
``under-defined'' in voters' minds. ``For people to suggest that
the remedy is to push that party further left, in my opinion, is to
seek to make that party more irrelevant,'' he said.

NOTEBOOK: EVEN WHEN FURIOUS, VIKINGS STAY FOCUSED ON WINNING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Green picked up a copy of The Minneapolis Star Tribune on
Wednesday and couldn't believe what he was reading. Green's players
saw the same article and were also infuriated. In the past, such
strong emotions over something in the news media have distracted
the team and hurt its play on the field.
</P>
<P>
   But these are the new Vikings _ the 7-0 Vikings _ and the way
Green handled a potentially explosive situation shows how focused
this team has become. Green and all those talented players are
fixed on one thing: winning.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper column began by stating that Green and the Vikings
were having a solid season. Indeed, if the Vikings and the Denver
Broncos both win Sunday, they will be only the sixth and seventh
teams to go undefeated in their first eight games since the NFL
instituted the 16-game schedule in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   But the column ended with a paragraph labeled as racist by
Green, many Vikings players and civic leaders in Minneapolis. ``Red
McCombs walks around the Vikings' locker room in a hideous electric
purple blazer,'' the column said, ``and exchanges high-fives with
players who have nothing in common with him, yet they treat him as
if he's their chicken-fried Moses.''
</P>
<P>
   The column sparked an angry reaction not just from the Vikings,
but also from the St. Paul chapter of the Urban League, which sent
a letter of support to Green and the Vikings. The National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the St. Paul
and Minneapolis Urban League chapters are considering some form of
protest against the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Green would have showed his anger publicly by
ripping the columnist at a news conference in front of television
cameras. But not now. Green kept his emotions in check, and during
a team meeting on Thursday he told his players to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really had no choice but to talk to the team about the
article, because the players were furious,'' Green said. ``I told
them this is the kind of thing that in the past would distract us.
But we're a different team and I wanted to make sure the players
kept their focus. It's OK to be mad, just don't let what was
written keep us from focusing on our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's reaction shows how much he has changed. He no longer
stews over things he can't control. Armed with a new contract _ and
a new waistline after losing more than 50 pounds this summer _
Green is as happy as he has ever been. Recently, Green was
appointed by the White House to head a national effort to fight
drug abuse called the National Coachathon Against Drugs, in which
coaches are asked to spend a minimum of 10 minutes talking to their
teams about the dangers of drugs.
</P>
<P>
   A more relaxed and focused Green has translated into a sharper
Minnesota team. There was no better sign than when the Vikings went
into Detroit last week and won easily. Not that beating the Lions
is like beating the Broncos, but it was the sort of game Minnesota
might have lost in the past. The Vikings have been a seesaw team in
the 1990s, with huge victories followed by losses to teams they
should have beaten.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is a great offense. The Vikings have scored a
league-high 241 points, which puts them on pace to score 551. The
record for points scored in a season is 541, set by the Washington
Redskins in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest difference for the Vikings has been on defense.
Green's draft-day trade with New England for cornerback Jimmy
Hitchcock was criticized at the time, but turned out to be a smart
move. Hitchcock has a career-high three interceptions and returned
one 79 yards for a touchdown against Detroit. The Vikings lead the
league with 13 interceptions; they had 12 all of last season.
</P>
<P>
   Can they go 16-0? Their schedule shows three potential land
mines: Green Bay on Nov. 22, at Dallas on Nov. 26 and Jacksonville
on Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
   If the Vikings keep winning, each game will become more intense
and the target on their backs will only get bigger. Imagine the
pressure if they reach 12-0 or 14-0.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing fazes these Vikings. Green is an early contender for
coach of the year, and his Vikings seem ready for almost any
challenge _ on or off the field.

PATIENT, NOT PANICKED  
 SUCCESS IN TWO PLACES

<TEXT>
<P>
   Buccaneers coach Tony Dungy did not sound like a man whose team
was 3-4 and about to play a must-win game against Minnesota, one of
the best teams in the league. His voice was calm and he sounded as
if he had gotten, oh, at least four hours of sleep the night
before, an eternity for an NFL head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We of course aren't happy with our situation,'' Dungy said.
``But there is no panic here. None. There is no doubt in our minds
that we can turn this thing around.''
</P>
<P>
   With Dungy at the helm, and five of Tampa Bay's next seven games
at home, they have a solid chance. But at the end of the season,
the team may have to re-evaluate its quarterback situation. The
Buccaneers are ranked 28th in passing and 27th in total offense,
and much of the blame goes to quarterback Trent Dilfer.
</P>
<P>
   Dungy stands behind Dilfer, but even he must worry about how
poorly Dilfer has played for much of the season. Dilfer just
doesn't make plays, and his teammates privately wonder if he could
ever lead them to a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Trent can lead this team,'' Dungy said.
</P>
<P>
   Success in Two Places
</P>
<P>
   Jets coach Bill Parcells and Kansas City's Marty Schottenheimer,
who face each other at Arrowhead Stadium on Sunday, share something
besides a bad temper: They are two of only 11 head coaches in the
history of professional football who have won 30 or more
regular-season games with at least two teams. Parcells won 77 games
with the Giants and 32 with the Patriots, while Schottenheimer won
44 with Cleveland and 98 with the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   The two are in impressive company. Other 30-30 coaches include
George Allen (49 with the Los Angeles Rams and 67 with Washington),
Paul Brown (111 with Cleveland and 55 with Cincinnati), Weeb Ewbank
(59 with Baltimore and 71 with the Jets) and Don Shula (71 with
Baltimore and 257 with Miami). Brown, Ewbank and Shula are in the
Hall of Fame.

CHRISTOPHER GABLE, 58, DANCER WHO SWITCHED TO ACTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Christopher Gable, an English ballet star who made an unusually
successful transition to film and theater, died on Oct. 23 at his
home near Halifax in Yorkshire, England. He was 58.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said Anna Izza, spokeswoman for the
Northern Ballet in Leeds, which Gable directed.
</P>
<P>
   With his blond good looks and a sunny charm that telegraphed
itself to the farthest reaches of the theater, Gable quickly rose
to the top, though without much encouragement from the Royal
Ballet. He began his ballet career in the late 1950s and by the
early '60s was well on his way to becoming one of the most popular
and gifted dancers of his generation.
</P>
<P>
   He made his name playing adolescent characters like the cousin
in Kenneth MacMillan's 1960 ``Invitation,'' his first big role; the
poignantly tender young man in Frederick Ashton's ``Two Pigeons,''
and Romeo in MacMillan's ``Romeo and Juliet.''
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan created one of the great ballet partnerships when he
cast Gable with Lynn Seymour in ``The Invitation,'' a ballet noted
for its brutal rape scene. Ms. Seymour, like Gable a strong actor,
was a dancer whose passion and dark beauty were an ideal complement
to him.
</P>
<P>
   The two created the roles of Romeo and Juliet in the MacMillan
ballet, and though they were removed from the premiere cast at the
last moment and replaced by Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn, who
were considered bigger box-office draws, for many Gable and Ms.
Seymour defined and were defined by those roles.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath Gable's good looks and well-proportioned ballet body,
there lay an intelligence, warmth and seriousness that helped
propel him through the politics of the ballet world and into the
theater.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared as Lysander in Peter Brook's production of ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company and was
a member of the Royal Exchange Theater in Manchester for several
seasons. Gable acted frequently on television, most notably in Ken
Russell's BBC television film ``Delius.'' Gable also appeared in
Russell's films ``The Rainbow'' and ``The Boy Friend,'' where he
played the title role opposite Twiggy.
</P>
<P>
   Gable returned to ballet in 1982, when he founded, with Ann
Stannard, the Central School of Ballet in Clerkenwell. In 1987 he
was lured back to the stage for the Northern Ballet Theater
production of Gillian Lynne's ``Simple Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gable was soon pressed into service directing the endangered
company, building it into a major English troupe specializing in
dance drama. He continued to work with the company up to his death.
</P>
<P>
   A Cockney born in North London, Gable was an unlikely candidate
for ballet stardom and often talked of his career luck. Forced by
his mother to take piano lessons along with the dance classes he
lobbied for as a child, Gable was simply placed in the most
convenient ballet school that did not require him to cross any busy
streets. By the age of 11, however, he was accepted by the Sadler's
Wells Opera (now Royal) Ballet School.
</P>
<P>
   Gable's performing career began unpromisingly when he was put
into the Covent Garden Opera Ballet on graduation, though he soon
talked his way into the touring company of the Royal Ballet, where
he danced from 1957 to 1963.
</P>
<P>
   He moved up into the prestigious wing of the company that
performed at Covent Garden in 1963. There he partnered most of the
leading ballerinas and made an impact in major roles that included
Prince Siegfried in ``Swan Lake,'' Colas in Ashton's ``Fille Mal
Gardee,'' Solor in ``La Bayadere'' and Franz in ``Coppelia.''
</P>
<P>
   Gable left the Royal Ballet two years after the disappointment
over ``Romeo and Juliet,'' attributing his departure to his
persistent difficulties with arthritic feet.
</P>
<P>
   Gable was the subject of a 1989 BBC-TV documentary, ``The
Amazing Adventures of Christopher Gable.'' He was made a Commander
of the British Empire in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Carole; a son, Tomas; a daughter,
Emma, and a brother, Brian.

TRAIL OF MOTHER'S SLAYING LEADS BACK HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ For 27 years, Maylon Johnson's two sons had been
frustrated that their mother's killer was never caught. So last
month, they asked the Newark Police Department to reinvestigate the
case, not knowing where the trail would lead.
</P>
<P>
   It led back to their own family. Last week, their sister, Susan
Marie Watson, made the stunning admission to investigators here
that as a teen-ager she had killed her mother and then tried to pin
the shooting death on someone else.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in yet another strange twist to the tale, it is likely that
Ms. Watson, a 41-year-old mother of three, will face prosecution on
murder charges as a juvenile because she was only 14 at the time of
the killing.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 3, 1971, Ms. Watson called the Newark police to report
that her mother had been shot once in the chest and lay near death
in their family home on S. 20th Street. In her initial interview
with the police, Ms. Watson told investigators that she had
awakened at 4 a.m. to go to the bathroom and heard tires screeching
outside her window. When she ran to her mother's bedroom, according
to her statement to the police, Ms. Watson found her in bed, lying
in a pool of blood. Mrs. Johnson died, police said, before she
could be taken to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Watson's statement indicated that the car she had
heard belonged to her mother's boyfriend, investigators failed to
turn up enough evidence to charge the man, who died nearly two
years ago, police said. The case remained unsolved for nearly three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But an unexpected break in the case came about two weeks ago
when Ms. Watson's brothers, who live here and whose names were not
released, saw a news report about a special squad in the Newark
Police Department dedicated to investigating unsolved crimes. The
brothers, who were 8 and 10 at the time of the killing, requested
that detectives reopen their mother's file.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they just weren't satisfied that their mother's
boyfriend was never arrested and were curious as to whether he was
in fact responsible,'' said Sgt. Derek Glenn, a police spokesman.
``They were only looking for closure, for an explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Ms. Watson, a data-entry clerk, lived a
law-abiding life in Schenectady, N.Y., for years before her arrest.
But police here theorize that she shot her mother because Mrs.
Johnson had scoffed at her daughter's claims of sexual abuse by her
mother's boyfriend and others. Ms. Watson finally confessed to the
killing on Oct. 23 after detectives confronted her with
discrepancies between her initial statement and statements made
once the case was reopened, authorities said. Police would not
specify what those discrepancies in testimony were.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very much relieved,'' Glenn said. ``I guess she was
relieved because everything had finally come to light. It was
definitely a burden on her.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Glenn said he was not surprised that Ms. Watson's story had
eventually unraveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you falsify something, you have to remember that which
isn't true,'' he said. ``And it's always harder to remember
something that isn't true than something that is true.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson is being held without bail in the Essex County Jail
Annex in Caldwell, N.J., where repeated attempts to reach her by
telephone failed.
</P>
<P>
   She was initially held for three days in Newark's Juvenile
Detention Center along with 250 youths, all but seven of whom were
male teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, she is scheduled to appear in Essex County Superior
Court for a detention hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her age when the slaying occurred and because state
law in 1971 prohibited a 14-year-old offender from being treated as
an adult, prosecutors in Essex County have been perplexed about how
to how to handle Ms. Watson's case.
</P>
<P>
   According to several experts in juvenile criminal law, the case
of a teen-ager's confessing to murder years later as an adult seems
to be unique. The county, these experts said, will most likely be
compelled to prosecute Ms. Watson as a youth offender under
juvenile statutes from 27 years ago, which are significantly less
severe than today's amended laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only option,'' said Michael O'Brien, acting
division manager of Essex County Family Court. ``The option to
waive her to adult court does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watson's attorney, Walter Florczak, refused to discuss her
case except to say that the legal issues that surround it could
present a problem for county prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unclear what, if any, penalty can be imposed,'' he
said. ``There's a question of whether they can incarcerate her
beyond the age of 21.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the old state law, only juvenile defendants 16 or older
could be sent to adult court to stand trial. But the law was
changed in the early 1980s to permit defendants as young as 14 to
be prosecuted as adults. The old law also put severe restrictions
on the amount of time that young offenders could spend in jail,
said Chris Kubright, the juvenile section chief for the Middlesex
County prosecutor's office. In 1971, a juvenile convicted of murder
would most likely be jailed only until age 21. Under current law,
however, juveniles face a maximum of 20 years in prison if
convicted of murder, Kubright said.
</P>
<P>
   The conflicting statutes present a possible strategy for defense
attorneys, who might be able to argue that neither juvenile court
nor adult criminal court has authority to try Ms. Watson, said
Robert Schwartz, executive director of the Juvenile Law Center in
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I couldn't figure out which court would have
jurisdiction,'' he said. ``It's not clear to me that any court
would be able to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is clearly an odd case,'' he added. ``And the law is not
written for odd cases.''

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: STEWART ON THE MOVE; ASSISTANT G.M. LOSES A
GAMBLE; BANNER YEAR FOR HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>

   As the pitching coach of the San Diego Padres, Dave Stewart had
three weeks of prime post-season time to advertise his interest in
becoming a farm director or assistant general manager for a major
league team. An insightful observer of the game, he spent the time
talking about the Padres' pitchers, but in each daily mass
interview with reporters he also talked about his desire to have a
meaningful front-office job. He is on his way to getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he was interviewed for the assistant general manager's
job in Oakland and in Florida, and he has another interview lined
up for a similar job in Toronto. That's the one he most likely will
take because he is close with the people there, having pitched for
the Blue Jays in 1993 and '94, and Gord Ash, the general manager,
has said he can write his own job description.
</P>
<P>
   A Losing Proposition
</P>
<P>
   At $300,000 in the first year of an escalating five-year
contract, Dan O'Dowd had a higher salary as assistant general
manager of the Cleveland Indians than some general managers,
including Brian Cashman of the Yankees. No longer. The Indians will
announce Tuesday that O'Dowd is gone, replaced by Mark Shapiro, the
heretofore director of minor league operations.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dowd, 39 years old, precipitated his own departure by asking
for permission to interview for jobs elsewhere, including the
general manager vacancy in Baltimore. By doing so, he went against
the basis on which Richard Jacobs, the owner, offered him the
lucrative contract earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   When he wanted to seek the Orioles' job, O'Dowd was told he
would have to forfeit the contract and if he did, there might not
be a place for him if he didn't get the position. O'Dowd, who had
been an assistant general manager for six years, gambled and lost.
</P>
<P>
   A front-office executive familiar with the Orioles' interviews
said O'Dowd's first interview went well, but in his second he
clashed with the owner, Peter Angelos. Now he will interview for a
newly created vice president's job in Colorado that is supposed to
lead, by design, to the general manager's job.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro, 31 years old, turned down a job in the Yankees' front
office last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Home Run Fever
</P>
<P>
   The season has been over for a month, and fans still can't get
enough of Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. On Saturday, the Hall of
Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., concluded its busiest October ever, with
more than 36,000 visitors flocking to see the instruments with
which McGwire hit 12 of his last 15 home runs and Sosa hit eight of
his last 10, along with other paraphernalia from some of their
historic games.
</P>
<P>
   September attendance was up 78 percent from last year, and the
combined attendance of more than 70,000 for the last two months was
a record for that period. The Hall projects attendance for the year
to be up 12 percent over last year, to about 320,000. That would be
the first annual increase since 1993, the largest attendance since
1995 and the largest increase from one year to the next in nine
years.

METS RESPOND TO PUSH FROM THE BRONX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill.)  (Eds: See also BBO-NOTEBOOK) 
(mk)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ For George Steinbrenner to say anything even remotely
critical about the New York Mets' $91 million signing of Mike
Piazza is disingenuous. The devil didn't make the Mets do it;
George did.
</P>
<P>
   In making Piazza the highest-paid baseball player ever (as long
as ever lasts, another few weeks at most), the Mets simply followed
Steinbrenner's lead and responded to his success. The Mets play in
New York, too, and they learned once again this year that too few
people realize it.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees knocked the Mets into near oblivion early in the
season, and the Mets never really recovered even though they did
contend for a playoff spot down to the last day of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees drew a record number of fans to Yankee Stadium, just
under 3 million. The Mets, who twice have drawn 3 million, had
2,287,942 fans at Shea Stadium, only the eighth-best attendance in
their history. The crowds for two significant September series,
against Atlanta and the last against Montreal, weren't
embarrassing, but they were far below what they should have been
for a team scrapping for a playoff spot.
</P>
<P>
   So what were the Mets to do? Let Piazza leave and sink back into
the Flushing swamp, not to be heard from for another decade? Cede
the city to the Yankees for another season or three or six? Would
Steinbrenner have slashed his gaudy payroll and relinquished the
role he covets _ owner of the World Series champion _ while the
Mets wallowed in mediocrity?
</P>
<P>
   No, no and no. Steinbrenner can tweak the Mets for such lavish
spending, but he invented lavish spending. He can say, as he always
does when a new plateau is ascended, that he was not the one to set
new salary standards. But Steinbrenner's overall expenditures have
made the Mets second-class citizens in their own town, and they
have to try to rise above that status. So they overpay Piazza by
more millions than most players make, and they accomplish two
goals:
</P>
<P>
   They retain a ferocious hitter who is a marquee player, and they
short-circuit the city's zealous, wide-eyed celebration of the
Yankees in the aftermath of their World Series conquest. In fact,
credit the Mets for supplanting the Yankees, even if temporarily,
at the forefront of the public's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of the elements that led to that juncture and some
of the factors that will make for a riveting off-season:
</P>
<P>
   MIKE PIAZZA: When the Mets offered Piazza $91 million, they had
no idea what any other team would offer him as a free agent.
Baseball people have estimated that the Mets' offer was $20 million
to $30 million more than Piazza could have gained elsewhere. The
Mets would not be the first team to overpay, but no team has ever
overpaid by that much.
</P>
<P>
   At the announcement of the signing, Piazza said, ``It was an
easy decision for me,'' and, upon hearing from his agent about how
productive the first meeting with general manager Steve Phillips
was, ``I knew it was going to happen here and that there was no
second choice for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it was an easy first choice for Piazza if his agent
determined from the baseball underground that $91 million was light
years ahead of the next best package that would be available. And
did the Mets really have to include award bonuses in the deal? For
$13 million a year, they should expect a most valuable player
performance from Piazza every season without additional inducement.
</P>
<P>
   AL LEITER: The pitcher got what he wanted because, again, the
Mets couldn't afford not to sign him. But even with the signing of
Piazza and Leiter, the Mets are only even with their
end-of-the-season position. They have not improved themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, having a productive Piazza from the start of the season
can make a difference, but the Mets have to add another hitter to
their lineup, notably a power-hitting outfielder. Albert Belle fits
that description better than anyone available, but the Mets don't
feel they're that desperate.
</P>
<P>
   TODD HUNDLEY: He bled Mets orange and blue, but he nevertheless
became expendable. That'll teach him to get hurt. He also has
learned a lesson about loyalty: It doesn't pay. Clubs show no
loyalty to players.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are so grateful for the service and energy Hundley
devoted to them that they don't even want to grant him his wish and
trade him to a National League team. They want to stow him in the
American League so he can't come back and hurt them. But they owe
him one and may want to reconsider that position.
</P>
<P>
   BERNIE WILLIAMS: Unless the Yankees have an epiphany at their
organizational meetings in Tampa this week, they will not do what
it will take to keep their home-grown center fielder at home. Even
if they were to try, they might not be able to succeed. Williams
has a long memory, and it's filled with grudges from negotiations
past.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees aren't expected to offer him more than $10 million
or $11 million a year for five years, but one major league
executive said there's talk that one or more teams will offer
Williams more than $100 million for seven or eight years. If so,
bye, bye, Bernie.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ALBERT BELLE: The idea seemed ludicrous at first glance. One of
the key ingredients to the Yankees' success, they said, was the
good chemistry in the clubhouse. But now the Yankees won't surprise
anyone in baseball if they sign Belle, a 35-day free agent.
</P>
<P>
   There goes the the chemistry. But as Jim Frey, the former
manager, said, ``Give me a three-run home run, and I'll show you
good team chemistry.'' Belle's ability to hit those three-run home
runs is what prompted Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, to urge
general manager Brian Cashman to trade for him during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's presence would make the Yankees more offensive in more
ways than one. He doesn't always get along with his teammates, let
alone the news media, and one physician who has dealt with players,
though not Belle, calls him the Mike Tyson of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But he slugs home runs (50, 48, 49 three of the past four
years), drives in runs (152 this year, more than 100 each of the
last seven) and hits .300 (four of the past five seasons). He would
give the Yankees the right-handed power hitter they could use, and
he would more than provide the offense Williams would take with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Belle, however, would take more than $35 million for
three years because that's what he could get if he opts to remain
with the Chicago White Sox. With competition very likely coming
from Boston, where Belle could beat the Green Monster into
submission, the Yankees would have to offer perhaps a better deal
than they may offer Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Why not, then, offer Williams more money and years? Someone
else's players have always looked more attractive to Steinbrenner
than his own.

SPLIT IN ENDORSEMENTS DEPRIVES CANDIDATES OF ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Calif., Ill, S.C., Wash., Wis.)   (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also sent in category `a') 
(jw) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Labor unions in New York State are badly divided over
their endorsements in this year's Senate race, depriving Alfonse
D'Amato, the incumbent, and Rep. Charles Schumer of prized
endorsements that could give them an edge in their neck-and-neck
race.
</P>
<P>
   Several large unions have backed D'Amato, wanting to thank him
for the repeated favors he has done for them during his 18 years in
the Senate. But other unions, while appreciating D'Amato's help,
have decided to endorse Schumer because they want to help the
Democrats keep at least 40 seats and prevent Republicans from
obtaining a filibuster-proof majority. Democrats now hold 45 seats
to the Republicans' 55.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most important labor endorsement that D'Amato has
received comes from the Building and Construction Trades Council of
New York State, which the senator has wooed repeatedly over the
years. The council, with 160,000 members, was so enthusiastic about
D'Amato that it endorsed him in August, even before Democrats
selected a candidate in the September primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato has an excellent record creating jobs for the
building and construction trades in New York,'' said Edward Malloy,
president of the building trades council. ``The senator does so
much on a daily basis for labor that often goes unnoticed.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example of D'Amato's help, Malloy cited his fighting to
reconfigure federal aid formulas so that the state received
hundreds of millions of dollars for highway and rapid transit
construction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't see deserting a friend of the building and
construction trades,'' Malloy said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jay Mazur, president of the nation's leading apparel union,
the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees,
insisted that Schumer had been a better friend to labor than
D'Amato. While D'Amato has a much higher pro-labor voting record
than do most Republicans, his lifetime pro-labor voting record is
47 percent, while Schumer's is 91 percent, according to the
AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Schumer has an extraordinarily good labor record,''
Mazur said. ``But D'Amato has supported the basic principles of the
Republican Party, although he has voted with us once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Other unions supporting Schumer include the Communications
Workers of America and the Service Employees International Union.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders who praise D'Amato note that he has voted labor's
way on litmus-test issues like raising the minimum wage and keeping
the Davis-Bacon Act, which guarantees that workers on government
projects be paid the prevailing wage, normally close to the union
wage.
</P>
<P>
   With unions so divided, neither candidate has been able to
muster the two-thirds support needed for an endorsement from the
New York State AFL-CIO, which has 2.1 million members. This means
that the dozens of campaign workers mobilized by the AFL-CIO to
make calls for labor-endorsed Democrats _ like Rep. Maurice Hinchey
of Saugerties and Rep. Carolyn McCarthy of Long Island _ will not
be urging union members to vote for Schumer.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it means that AFL-CIO callers who urge union members
to vote for labor-endorsed Republican representatives _ like
Michael Forbes of Long Island and Jack Quinn of Buffalo _ will not
be urging people to vote for D'Amato. Two of the New York City's
most prominent union leaders have been torn between D'Amato and
Schumer, but, labor leaders say, their parent unions in Washington
have pressured them to side with Schumer to help ensure that
Democrats retain 40 seats in the Senate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That, labor leaders say, was the case with Dennis Rivera,
president of 1199, the National Health and Human Service Employees
Union, which has 150,000 members and recently merged into the
Service Employees International Union. It was the same story, labor
leaders say, with Stanley Hill, executive director of District
Council 37, which represents 120,000 New York City municipal
employees and is part of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   When a visibly agonized Rivera endorsed Schumer three weeks ago,
he had kind words for D'Amato, thanking him for all the help he had
given 1199, but he said it was nonetheless vital to back Schumer.
He echoed many labor leaders in Washington who contend that if the
Democrats fall to fewer than 40 seats in the Senate, the Republican
majority will be able to push through anti-labor legislation, like
bills to cut financing for the National Labor Relations Board and
for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders, fearing that incumbent Democratic senators may
lose seats in Wisconsin, Illinois, California, South Carolina and
Washington, are eager to pick up a seat in New York, a move they
say will make it hard for the Democrats to fall to fewer than 40.
Many labor experts see the political divisions as more evidence of
the end of labor solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this is kind of a wash for the candidates,'' said Norman
Adler, a political consultant for both Democrats and Republicans.
``The unions don't seem to be able to draw together in the big
races.''

SPLIT IN ENDORSEMENTS DEPRIVES CANDIDATES OF ADVANTAGE

   NEW YORK _ Labor unions in New York State are badly divided over
their endorsements in this year's Senate race, depriving Alfonse
D'Amato, the incumbent, and Rep. Charles Schumer of prized
endorsements that could give them an edge in their neck-and-neck
race.
</P>
<P>
   Several large unions have backed D'Amato, wanting to thank him
for the repeated favors he has done for them during his 18 years in
the Senate. But other unions, while appreciating D'Amato's help,
have decided to endorse Schumer because they want to help the
Democrats keep at least 40 seats and prevent Republicans from
obtaining a filibuster-proof majority. Democrats now hold 45 seats
to the Republicans' 55.
</P>
<P>
   By far the most important labor endorsement that D'Amato has
received comes from the Building and Construction Trades Council of
New York State, which the senator has wooed repeatedly over the
years. The council, with 160,000 members, was so enthusiastic about
D'Amato that it endorsed him in August, even before Democrats
selected a candidate in the September primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al D'Amato has an excellent record creating jobs for the
building and construction trades in New York,'' said Edward Malloy,
president of the building trades council. ``The senator does so

RUNNING A BROTHER'S RACE TO FIND OUT WHY HE STOPPED
</HEADLINE>

 (nk) 
 By KIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everyone told my brother Gary he should run a
marathon someday. We all knew he had it in him. He'd run two hours
in the morning to warm up for an all-day bike ride through the
mountains around Salt Lake City, where he lived. He ran in the
dark, and in the snow, and in the blazing heat. He pushed his body
hard to see where he could take it.
</P>
<P>
   And Lord knows he had the right temperament. His whole being
radiated with the deep mellow alpha wave of a natural endurance
athlete. He seemed enfolded in what I thought of as a kind of
Zen-like pocket of inner peace _ a permanent runner's high for
which I envied him. He even ate like a man with one eye on the
thousand-yard horizon, slowly chewing and savoring every bite until
eventually, after the rest of us in the family had gobbled like
sprinters, there he'd be, and nothing left for us to do but sit
there and watch him finish.
</P>
<P>
   But he never took the step of committing to do a marathon. He
always waved the idea off as something he didn't have time for. I
think the larger reason, though, was that he felt it would be too
selfish, too pretentious, too great a claim on the spotlight,
which, in his eternally self-effacing way, he always felt should be
directed at someone else. Undertaking a marathon is an act of
hubris, a statement of bald self-assertion and ego that Gary
couldn't quite bring himself to make.
</P>
<P>
   So I am running for him. When I cross the finish line of the New
York City Marathon Sunday afternoon, my race will be his _ I will
complete the marathon he should have run. I will continue on to the
place where he could not. Indeed, if there's a single phrase that
sums up and captures my yearlong journey to a first marathon at age
40, that is probably pretty close to it: I will continue on.
</P>
<P>
   Gary, for reasons I think we will never know, took his own life
in August 1997 _ suddenly, shatteringly and without explanation. He
left everyone who loved him grasping at questions that dissolved at
the touch into other questions that were even worse. His death
threw my belief in the order and predictability of the universe
into a place of dark and groaning uncertainty. Gary was the most
stable, centered person I knew. If he could take such a course,
then what was stable? What could be counted on?
</P>
<P>
   What was worse, most people in our family thought that Gary, the
oldest of five children, and I, the youngest, were most alike. More
than 16 years separated us in age, and for many years most of a
continent as well, but we stayed connected. For a long time that
was a gift _ suddenly it became a threat: Was the sense of
stability I felt in my own life a fragile facade as well, as Gary's
seemed to have been? What could I trust, even in myself?
</P>
<P>
   My response to all that, rational or not, was to put on my
running shoes and take off. I returned from Gary's funeral a
marathoner _ in spirit and determination if not yet in fact _ bound
and determined by forces I could neither fully describe nor control
to run the 26.2-mile New York City Marathon in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   I had been a casual two- or three-times-a-week runner before
that _ rarely more than 15 miles a week total mileage, often less.
But I suddenly needed more _ I needed my body to take me to a new
place. I needed to run in a way I never had before in my life.
</P>
<P>
   A word of advice: Grief running is probably not very wise for
the body. I severely overtrained in the first months _ doubling my
weekly mileage, and then tripling and quadrupling it until I was
hobbled and limping every morning with plantar fasciitis, a
straining of the tendon that connects the heel to the ball of the
foot. So I iced and I limped, and popped Advil, and ignoring the
looks of strangers on the streets of New York or wherever I
happened to be, I would stop everything and do stretching exercises
right on the sidewalk when it started to act up, and I kept going,
and slowly over the months it mostly healed.
</P>
<P>
   But my high dive into long-distance running has also taken me to
a new place where the questions about my brother's life and death
have become _ if not quite answered _ at least more focused.
Pushing the envelope into longer distances opened a door for me:
Out there beyond 20 miles I felt I had passed a threshold into a
kind of undiscovered country of the mind and body. As my former
physical limits faded behind me, I began to wonder if the limits I
had perceived about thought and consciousness might be elastic as
well.
</P>
<P>
   What makes a human being go? What makes a person run, climb, try
hard, get up in the morning, and what makes him stop? That, I
realized with a blinding flash one morning on a long run through
the suburbs of central New Jersey, was what still bound Gary and
me: He had stopped short, and I had accelerated. We were still
linked. It was simple old Newtonian physics _ inertia and momentum.
</P>
<P>
   So much of our lives is propelled by the things that are already
in motion around us, all carrying us along, for better or for
worse, in rhythms that are outside our control. The flow of jobs
and commitments and family life and friends rolls on _ it's natural
and easy to let the march of days push us forward as it will. We
all match our own stride, in varying degrees, to the pace around us
because we're social animals.
</P>
<P>
   Gary broke his stride, stopped the machine. He halted the
momentum of life and asserted his will to stop; in a way I still
don't quite understand, that triggered my will to go.
</P>
<P>
   And when I look around the vast field of runners Sunday in New
York, I will still be raking over some of these same questions: Why
are we doing this thing _ because we are strong and chasing a goal,
or because we are scared and weak and fleeing a demon? Are we
running toward something, or running away? Was Gary right _ is
running a marathon an act of unjustifiable selfishness, or can it
be more? Am I running because I am like Gary, or to reassure myself
that I'm not?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I've contracted a kind of runners' dementia, but I
believe there are answers out there _ reachable, perhaps, just down
the road. There's a spiritual realm at the frontiers of endurance
that calls to me with the promise, or the possibility at least, of
illumination about all the things that are rattling around inside
me.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday I run for Gary. I run with a swatch of his old
worn-out running shorts _ a treasured gift from his wife _ pinned
to my shirt, and with bib No. 15515 Blue dedicated to his memory.
Sunday he will finish the race.

 &HT;    It's not easy when father was a legend named Maravich
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Mike Tierney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUSCALOOSA, Ala. _ At age 4, the kid caught a miniature ball
from his dad and flung up his first shot. ``I was hooked,'' he
recalls. Before long, he was practicing for hours each day, taking
aim at the personalized hoop, 8 1/2 feet high, that dad had erected
in a makeshift mini-gym on the third floor of their house north of
New Orleans. Little brother had his own goal, 5 1/2 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball was their bond, same as it was between dad and
granddad. It was the means by which generations of the family
connected.
</P>
<P>
   This was no ordinary family. At 7, the kid came home from school
one day and asked, ``Daddy, didn't you used to be Pistol Pete?''
</P>
<P>
   At 9, another day after school, the kid came home to find gloomy
grown-ups moping about. That morning, Pistol Pete Maravich, the
most creative, artistic player since Naismith hammered up peach
baskets, had collapsed during a pick-up game out west and died.
Daddy was 40. All of that, less than a year after the kid's other
basketball tutor _ his granddad Press, whom he called Paw Paw _ had
expired from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Instantly, the basketball pilot light in Jaeson Maravich began
to flicker. ``Once my died died _ I love basketball, but it went
down,'' he says now. The loving man who instilled in him the basics
of shooting, passing and dribbling, who cheered him on at the
youth-league games, was gone. ``I didn't have anybody to share it
with.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, the light is not exactly burning bright. But
after being extinguished for a while, it has been reignited. Jaeson
will wear Daddy's old NBA jersey number, 44, this season as a
non-scholarship freshman at the University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   It is, at once, a blessing and a curse that Jaeson, 19, is the
spittin' image of Pete, tall (6 feet 4), lanky (185 pounds),
angular face, bounce in his step.
</P>
<P>
   He is button-popping proud to be his father's son, so much so
that he says, ``I think about him every day.'' Jaeson still reads
his Bible, still doesn't sip soft drinks _ lessons ingrained in him
by Pete, whose twilight years revolved around Christianity and
strict diet.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he must lug around the most distinctive surname known to the
sport, a burden accompanied by enormous expectations from himself
and the public. Not easy for any young man, especially one as
reserved as Jaeson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my dreams sometimes, my last name is Smith,'' he says.
``People assume I don't have to work hard because I'm Pete
Maravich's son.''
</P>
<P>
   When you are a sawed-off Pistol, your autograph is sought by the
time you're playing in a prepubescent rec league, and you are so
shy that protective teammates sign in your place. (Don't forget the
``e'' in Jaeson, guys.) You are expected to excel because you were
taught at the bony knee of the master. Later, TV crews will invade
your gym. A fan or two will taunt you.
</P>
<P>
   By ninth grade, Jaeson had cultivated the tips passed down by
Pete and become a decent player, lacking his father's flair and
take-control compulsion but not his elementary skills and shooting
eye. Then he was struck by a realization, much like one of Pete's
no-look passes nailing an unsuspecting teammate in the nose.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was pressure on me, playing in Louisiana,'' he said,
eternally aware that Pete's legend took root at Louisiana State
University, whose team plays in Maravich Assembly Center. ``It
became like a job. I lost my love for the game. I was trying to be
like my dad, be as good as him.''
</P>
<P>
   After his freshman season in high school, he shocked his coach,
Marty Fontenot, with the news that he was quitting the team. ``The
fire wasn't there,'' remembers his mother, Jackie.
</P>
<P>
   No organized ball for two seasons, just choose-'em-up games on
weekends. Jaeson burned off energy pumping iron in the weight room
and bulked up to 210 pounds. Come his senior year, Jaeson beseeched
Fontenot to take him back. The coach put it to a vote of his
players, who unanimously welcomed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played pretty good for taking off 2 1/2 years,'' Fontenot
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the lost seasons dashed any realistic hope of a scholarship.
``Looking back, I wish I would have played,'' he said. ``It hurt me
more than it helped me. Had (Pete) been alive, I don't think I
would have quit two years.''
</P>
<P>
   At least he returned more relaxed, able to deal with his
pedigree. When he toed the foul line and heard someone shout,
``You're never gonna be as good as your dad,'' Jaeson would smile
and think to himself, ``I know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Unprepared for college ball, Jaeson checked out five prep
schools recommended by coach Tim Floyd _ then of the University of
New Orleans, now with the Chicago Bulls _ and chose New Hampton
(N.H.). Its coaching staff was well-versed in handling and, when
necessary, coddling the offspring of basketball celebrities. The
first was Pat Knight, son of Bobby, who coped with vicious fans
hurling chairs onto the court.
</P>
<P>
   Jaeson arrived with an injured back, the penalty for a skinny
guy who tries to squat-lift well over 200 pounds without wearing a
belt. When the thermometer dropped to single digits, another malady
set in: homesickness. ``It was, like, the other end of the world,''
he says, ``as far away from Louisiana as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletics director Mark Tilton recalls fans entering the gym,
asking, ``Where is he?'' They never saw any Maravich progeny. He
did not suit up for a single game. Before the springtime thaw,
Jaeson was back home to stay. Another basketball season down the
drain, the third in four years. The promise he had shown in the
ninth grade, then again in the 12th, was growing stale. The seeds
planted by Pete were producing no fruit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who have famous fathers, some handle it well, others
struggle with it,'' Tilton said. ``I tell them to try not to put
too much pressure on yourself. Just be the best Jaeson you can
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Jackie Maravich, who reared the boys on her own
while operating an antique shop, resisted giving a gentle push
toward basketball, or away from it. It was Pete who had served as
the hands-on parent, occasionally with a belt in his hand when
Jaeson misbehaved. For Jackie, playing hoops ``is going to be his
decision. Whatever makes him happy. If that's what he loves ...''
</P>
<P>
   John Lotz, assistant athletics director at North Carolina, was
Pete's closest pal at the time of his death and had maintained
contact with the family. He called another friend, incoming Alabama
coach Mark Gottfried, and made a successful pitch for Jaeson as a
walk-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him,'' Gottfried said. ``He's willing to work hard
(even though) there's no guarantee of ever seeing the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Walk-ons are not gifted or developed enough to earn a
scholarship, so Gottfried must calm expectations of Crimson Tide
fans who might have to settle for watching Jaeson sink jump shots
only during pregame and halftime warmups.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the day Jaeson announced for Alabama, Gottfried held
up a newspaper and ran his fingers across the main headline on the
front page. ``It was like the morning Kennedy was shot,'' he said,
shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody would be more delighted than Gottfried if the son of
Pistol Pete earns a few minutes of playing time. ``Pete was my
hero,'' he says. ``Jaeson is a guy you're pulling for.''
</P>
<P>
   Why Alabama? It's in the Southeastern Conference. It's close
enough that he can drive the four hours home once a month, but not
too close. It's a fresh program under Gottfried, who prefers the
up-tempo offense that any Maravich would embrace. And it's not LSU,
the epicenter of Pistol Pete's legend that lives on in books, a
Hollywood movie, instructional videos and word-of-mouth tales.
</P>
<P>
   Fact, not fiction: As a kid, Pete would take an aisle seat at
the movie house and bounce a ball non-stop through a triple
feature. He would lean outside a car window and dribble while the
vehicle was being driven by Press, his father and eventual coach at
LSU. He would launch a ball repeatedly off a gymnasium wall and, by
trial and error, figure out the angles as it then ricocheted off
the ceiling, off another wall and into his hands.
</P>
<P>
   How could any son hope to approach that work ethic and
subsequent achievement? For 28 years, Pete's NCAA scoring record of
3,667 points has stood firm _ all the more amazing in that he
played only three seasons and every basket counted for two points,
even the 35-footers. His decade-long NBA career that originated
with the Atlanta Hawks ended in 1979, a year before Jaeson's birth,
and was validated with his posthumous designation as one of the
league's 50 greatest players. Beyond the statistics and the
trophies, he is widely recognized as the pioneer of ``showtime''
and a guidepost to basketball's transition from rigid fundamentals
to playground flash.
</P>
<P>
   The autopsy floored his friends and family. It revealed that the
man who played with so much heart was born with only one coronary
artery instead of the normal two. He had not shown the slightest
symptom of a malformation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Pete's condition, ``They said it was a miracle he
lived past 20,'' Jaeson said. Soon after the funeral, Jackie took
him and younger brother Josh to the doctor and was relieved to
discover they have all of the necessary working parts.
</P>
<P>
   There is no good age to suddenly lose a parent; there might be
no worse age than 9. You are too young to comprehend yet old enough
to realize what has happened.
</P>
<P>
   Lotz, noting that Maravich had become an especially devoted dad
toward the end, said, ``When Pete was gone, it was a hurt that was
incomprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little mad that God took him so quick,'' Jaeson said.
The anger and confusion lasted well into his teens, at which time
he rationalized, ``It was just his time. God had a calling for
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jaeson's bedroom at home remains decorated with Maravich
memorabilia, including a pair of Pete's trademark floppy socks.
Three broken windows in the upstairs gym persuaded Jackie to have
the indoor goals removed, so the boys must shoot through outdoor
rims. The Maravich youth camps in Clearwater, Fla., which blend
roundball, religion and nutrition, have survived the passing of
their founder, with camp graduate Jaeson serving as a counselor
each summer.
</P>
<P>
   Jaeson's basketball story might be nearing a denouement. If
Alabama does not work out, he will evaluate whether to carry on
elsewhere. Coaching, he vows, is not in the cards.
</P>
<P>
   What about Josh? He is 16, a 10th-grader, 6 feet 2 and growing.
He, too, can play. And, unlike Jaeson, he displays Daddy's
boundless determination and extroverted nature. Fontenot, his
coach, says, ``Josh is a pepper.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody wants to prick Jaeson's feelings by predicting more
basketball upside for Josh. But Jaeson himself says, ``He'll end up
being better than me, probably.''
</P>
<P>
   He has accepted the fact that he is no re-Pete, that he shares
Daddy's passion for the game but not his vast ability and
perfectionist's approach. And that no youngster should feel trapped
by such a predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Magic Johnson was on the Leno show, and he said he wouldn't
want his son to play,'' Jaeson said. ``When I saw that, it really
hit me.''
</P>
<P>
   He has accepted his father's death, as well. But the next step _
healing _ remains a difficult work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to talk about it,'' he said. ``I'm as much sad
today (as the day he died). I'll never get over it.''

 &HT;    NFL a hot property, despite ratings slump
 &HT;    By Prentis Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When the NFL's four television partners shocked the
sports world with a collective eight-year, $17.6 billion deal, the
rationale of the networks was best characterized by Fox Sports
president David Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value of the deal is not right now or next year, but
further down the road,'' Hill said at the time. ``Television is
getting more diversified every year, and the NFL is the only solid
ground in a fairly scary swamp. Unlike TV shows, which (have) peaks
and die off, you know the NFL is one safe bet.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the midway point of 1998, there are questions whether
those deals will prove to be sucker bets. So far, only the Sunday
night cable package on ESPN is running ahead of last year's pace in
the ratings with a 7.5, up 3 percent. The NFC package on Fox and
the AFC on CBS are down 1 percent from a year ago, while ABC's
``Monday Night Football'' is off 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If those numbers hold, it will be the fifth straight year of
overall slippage in the NFL audience. Although the dropoff has not
been dramatic, ranging from 500,000 to 1.5 million homes, such
subtle erosion does not bode well for rights fees that jumped an
average of 111 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline (in network viewership) is real, and it's not
limited to sports,'' said Neal Pilson, former president of CBS
Sports, who now operates his own television consulting agency.
``But sports are performing better than other network
programming.''
</P>
<P>
   Although down, the NFL numbers still support that view. For
example, Fox is off only 1 percent despite the collective 13-30
record of teams in the nation's first-, third-, fourth-, seventh-,
eighth- and ninth-largest markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be lucky to be down 10 percent,'' Fox executive
producer Ed Goren said. ``To be down just 1 percent is rather
amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   However, amazing is not the word ABC is using about the 7
percent dropoff for ``Monday Night Football,'' the package
struggling the most to maintain past viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for the current slide have centered on the change to 8
p.m., the heightened interest in baseball and, believe it or not,
pro wrestling on TNT and USA, which two weeks ago combined for
nearly 3.3 million viewers in the male 12-34-year-old demographic
group, just 22,000 fewer than the World Series averaged in that age
group.
</P>
<P>
   Although ratings for ``Monday Night Football'' have risen in the
last couple of weeks, the NFL's crown jewel is unlikely to reclaim
the 16.5 rating it averaged over the four years of the previous
contract.
</P>
<P>
   And skeptics of the NFL deals still are predicting losses in the
hundreds of millions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The networks have gotten into a defensive posture about
whether they're making money or losing money,'' Pilson said. ``The
issue is whether having the NFL has made us a stronger company.''
</P>
<P>
   In that sense, there's no question Fox has grown substantially
since acquiring the NFL five years ago. And ``Monday Night
Football'' is still the top-rated program on ABC. And ESPN reports
that its prime-time ratings have jumped 104 percent, which vice
president Artie Bulgrin attributed to the ``halo effect'' of the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of the NFL's partners is as willing to talk about the
business side of their deals as CBS, which is back after a
four-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think a new show like `King of Queens' would have a
shot against `Monday Night Football' without the benefit of NFL
promotion,'' CBS Sports president Sean McManus said. ``There will
be weeks and months, or even years, when NFL ratings will be better
or worse than we hoped. But the NFL is a healthy product, and we're
getting the results we hoped for.

 &HT;    Intrasquad game tests Tech depth
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech will play its annual intrasquad game at 3
p.m. today in Alexander Memorial Coliseum, but the question is
whether the Yellow Jackets can field two competitive teams.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is yes, thanks to the help of two transfers who are
ineligible to play this season. Without 6-foot-3 Shaun Fein from
Stonehill College and 6-8 Michael Isenhour from Air Force, the
Yellow Jackets probably would not be able to put two representative
lineups on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   One team will consist of freshman point guard Tony Akins,
shooting guard T.J. Vines, small forward Jason Floyd, strong
forward Jon Babul and center Alvin Jones. The other will be Indiana
transfer Jason Collier (eligible Dec. 12) at center, Isenhour at
one forward, backup Ashley Kelly at the other, with Fein and
Florida A&AMP;M transfer Darryl LaBarrie in the backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of players, coach Bobby Cremins isn't worried
about the off-season trials and injuries that beset the Yellow
Jackets. Point guard Travis Spivey transferred in June to Iowa
State, and backup center Pablo Machado left in August for Loyola
Marymount. High-scoring guard Dion Glover tore up his knee and will
be out for the season, and Jones is the lone returnee from a team
that went 19-14 last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team has a great attitude, after it got over the shock of
losing Dion,'' Cremins said. ``The main thing is to get the Georgia
Tech chemistry back that we used to have. Two years ago, we just
about closed up shop. Last year, we took a tremendous step toward
coming back.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins refuses to make a prediction about where this team will
finish. ``We have a chance,'' he said. ``Tony Akins needs
experience, and he needs to get beat up a little bit. Right now,
he's ready to tackle the world, and I love his attitude. I just
don't want to see him shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Cremins says Jones' potential is unlimited. ``He just needs to
keep maturing,'' the coach said. ``We want him to score more. It's
his sophomore year, (so) he should score more.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier will join the team in time to play against Georgia on
Dec. 13, which will give the Jackets an immediate boost. ``Jason
just needs to play,'' Cremins said. ``He needs to get tougher, but
he has unbelievable potential. Jason Floyd has a big role as
starting forward and maybe playing some in the backcourt. Jon Babul
is a great kid who needs confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And will Cremins, who's been under some criticism over the past
two seasons, survive the rocky start this year already has thrown
his way?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fine,'' he said. ``I've said this 100 times; job security
is the last thing I'm concerned about. I'm committed more than ever
in bringing Georgia Tech back. I don't want to coach off of my past
accomplishments. I still think Tech and Bobby Cremins are a great
match.

 &HT;    Brown will try to fit in with Dogs
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the long, unwanted solitude that comes with
recovering from a major injury, Kiesha Brown spent countless days
trying to strengthen a left knee that has kept her sidelined for
all but eight games of her first two seasons at Georgia. Despite
her best efforts, the appendage seemingly had a will of its own,
refusing to heal as quickly as she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It almost speaks to me, as if it were another person,'' said
the former Woodward Academy star and Naismith national player of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   After tearing an anterior cruciate ligament as a freshman, Brown
damaged cartilage in the same knee in a pick-up game last summer.
Georgia coach Andy Landers waited until midseason before
redshirting her. She watched a lineup made up largely of freshmen
reach the first round of the NCAA Tournament without her. Now, it's
not certain whether she'll start initially in a backcourt that
relied heavily on Kelly and Coco Miller as rookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it's going to be a benefit. I have less
experience than they do,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, ranked in the top 10 in several preseason polls, has
all but three players back, and has been picked to finish behind
only defending NCAA champion Tennessee in the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   At Georgia Tech, however, coach Agnus Berenato has several new
faces who are being pressed to help the team rebound from an 11-17
season, Berenato's poorest in 10 years. The Lady Jackets signed
star New York City guard Niesha Butler, but have little height or
experience inside and will rely on quickness to push a fastbreaking
style.
</P>
<P>
   In the Trans America Athletic Conference, Georgia State is the
preseason No. 1, after reaching the tournament title game a year
ago. Coach Lea Henry has all five starters back, and 6-3 senior
center Christine James has slimmed down and is in better shape for
the team, which is seeking its first NCAA bid.

 &HT;    Open's close is bittersweet
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gene Sarazen's dream will not fade, but the tournament
that Don Panoz created to honor him plays out its final installment
this week at the Legends Course at Chateau Elan in Braselton.
</P>
<P>
   The process will not occur without irony. Five years after the
serious-money tournament began, pulling together world champions
from all over the globe, it has been squeezed from the schedule by
a new World Golf Championship.
</P>
<P>
   While technically there would be nothing to keep Panoz, the
Chateau Elan owner, from continuing the Sarazen, it would be
impossible to market with the world's top 50 players competing
concurrently at Valderrama, Spain, in an event involving the
Sarazen's two co-sanctioning bodies, the PGA Tour and European
Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too bad,'' defending champion Mark Calcavecchia said.
``I'm sure sad to see it end. It really doesn't deserve to be kind
of axed out of the schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   The situation notwithstanding, the Sarazen field emerged
impressively. Among the PGA Tour players in the field in addition
to Calcavecchia are Payne Stewart, Scott Hoch, Bob Tway, Scott
Verplank, Billy Andrade, Stewart Cink, Brad Faxon, John Huston, Tom
Kite, Craig Stadler, Bob Friend and two-time champion Frank Nobilo
of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   The European contingent does not include either Colin
Montgomerie or Lee Westwood, but claims Germany's Bernhard Langer
and nine of the top 20 players on the European money list _
Sweden's Patrick Sjoland (4), Spain's Miguel Angel Jimenez (5),
Sweden's Mathias Gronberg (9), Australia's Stephen Leaney (10),
Sven Struver of Germany (11), Stephen Allan of Australia (13),
Andrew Coltart (15) and Sam Torrance (16) of Scotland and England's
David Carter (18). American John Daly withdrew for scheduling
reasons this week; Italy's Costantino Rocca with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   As a small political bone for Chateau Elan, the WGC event after
two years in Spain will make one appearance at the former Sarazen
home. A ``Sarazen Cup'' or something similarly named is rumored to
become the official hardware of the new tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For Sarazen tournament director Lon Fellenz, tournament
preparations have tugged on his emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a sponsorship standpoint, we're probably a little better
than last year,'' he said, ``but there's a certain stigma that
unfortunately comes with a final deal. There's a mental flatness.
For those of us who've been involved from day one, it's kind of
difficult to see it come to a halt.''
</P>
<P>
   As if presenting the final Sarazen were not enough of a
challenge, it had to be done this year on top of the prestigious
Tour Championship, which concludes today East Lake Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think playing two golf tournaments in the same city
back to back is advantageous by any stretch,'' Fellenz said.
``There are only so many dollars dedicated to golf in metro
Atlanta.''

 &HT;    Quality of NFL hasn't kept up with its players
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Doug Flutie scrambled off to Vancouver in the
summer of 1990, hoping to revive his career with a dose of northern
exposure, the only thing that free agency meant to him was that he
was unemployable in his native country.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, having returned from a terrific stint in the
CFL that included three Grey Cup championship games, five most
valuable player awards and a slew of records, Flutie has discovered
that much changed in the NFL during his Canadian exile.
</P>
<P>
   Including the meaning and, more important, the significance of
free agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, it's something the players deserve,'' said Flutie,
now with the Buffalo Bills. ``But it's changed things a great deal.
I came back to a game where players are bigger and so much more
athletic than when I left ... but where all of the roster shuffling
and the turnover means that a key element of continuity has been
sacrificed.''
</P>
<P>
   The assessment is compelling, especially as viewed through the
unfiltered observation of Flutie. The former Heisman winner was so
unfamiliar with the NFL game of the late '90s that upon his return,
he had to spend a small fortune on football magazines just to learn
players' names. In essence, he is a time traveler, able to render
an unadulterated analysis of the game's evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Or, more accurately, its de-evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simple,'' Miami coach Jimmy Johnson said. ``The athletes
are better, but the teams are not. You probably can't come up with
statistics to show why, because the analysis is pretty subjective.
But, yeah, I think most people agree we've lost some quality.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent Harris Poll reinforced that the NFL remains the
most popular sport in America, by far. Of those surveyed, 55
percent identified themselves as NFL fans, the highest approval
rating ever generated by any sport and a 4 percent increase over
1997. Even with its television ratings diminished, commissioner
Paul Tagliabue was able to command record fees of $17.6 billion for
broadcast rights.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the polls and those dollar amounts, fans are expressing
their displeasure with the game by tuning out NFL telecasts.
Ratings are down considerably overall, particularly for ABC's
Monday Night Football, which is off 7 percent, and the NFC package
on Fox. The NFL ratings are down five seasons in a row, and
skeptics of the big-money broadcast deals are predicting losses in
the hundreds of millions.
</P>
<P>
   The game is confronted by a reality that eventually could erode
its unprecedented popularity: While the players are better than
ever, the overall product has regressed. The standard of play in
the NFL is lower. Team performances on Sunday afternoons tend to be
boring, in part because coaches know that consistent football
translates into winning football in this watered-down league.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Falcons could serve as the poster boys for such a
mindset. The club isn't aesthetic under Dan Reeves, but it is
sound. And a fundamental approach on offense, with a sound defense
that doesn't permit big plays, has come to be the winning formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a substance-over-style philosophy now,'' Arizona coach
Vince Tobin said. ``The big stars are great in their own right, but
they aren't enough to win with by themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The unpredictable Brett Favre has won three straight MVP awards
in Green Bay. Denver tailback Terrell Davis, once just an
afterthought at the University of Georgia, is on pace to shatter
the single-season rushing record. It is commonplace now for
receivers to register 100 catches in a season. But none of the
brilliant individual efforts has elevated the level of play in
recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Quantifying the slippage is difficult, as Miami's Johnson noted.
Identifying its origins, however, isn't as tough. While many in the
NFL trace the beginnings of decline to former commissioner Pete
Rozelle's initiatives toward parity, the seamless nature of the
game began to unravel a bit with the advent of free agency and the
salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike baseball, in which a pitcher can dominate a game, or
basketball, in which Michael Jordan might dictate tempo, success in
football is predicated largely on teamwork. The wholesale player
movement wrought by free agency, combined with the lack of depth a
salary cap now mandates, has resulted in a diluted product.
</P>
<P>
   In the five years before the current system was implemented in
'93, the NFL averaged 10.2 franchises with at least 10 victories
and 13.6 clubs with winning records. Over those five years, playoff
teams averaged 10.9 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Since '93, there have been only 8.4 teams per year with 10
victories or more. Playoff teams have averaged 10.5 wins, and there
have been 13.2 winning teams on average each year.
</P>
<P>
   In the ultimate team sport, NFL franchises have averaged turning
over more than four of their 22 starters each year since 1993. The
changes have resulted in ragged play and lack of cohesion.
</P>
<P>
   Only five teams, for instance, started the same offensive line
both last season and this season. Seven teams had three new line
starters. Minnesota, one of the franchises that made no line
changes, and actually made it a priority to retain its five
starters, now is one of only two undefeated clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't plug in two or three new (starters) every year and
not have it affect the way you perform,'' San Diego offensive line
coach Joe Bugel said. ``But that's what we have been doing lately.
So you're halfway into a season by the time your five (blockers)
get settled into a groove.
</P>
<P>
   ``And maybe while they were still getting used to each other,
your quarterback gets hurt because that new guard didn't slide out
and pick up the blitz. The lack of (cohesion) can kill your
season.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis coach Jim Mora said, ``You spend as much time now
dealing with free agency and (salary) cap issues as you do coaching
on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 highest-paid players on a team typically account for a
disproportionate share of the $52.38 million salary cap for each
club. As a result, coaches have been forced to integrate
minimum-salary players, usually rookies, into key backup roles. It
is rare now to see a four- or five-year veteran in a backup role,
because teams can't afford them. The league's middle class hasn't
been entirely eliminated but is smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Teams have less patience in developing players. Just three
seasons ago, Indianapolis fullback Zack Crockett rushed for a
team-record 157 yards in the Colts' playoff upset of San Diego. Two
weeks ago, after losing his job as a starter, he was cut; three
days after being claimed on waivers by Jacksonville, he played in
last Sunday's game against the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I barely knew the names of the guys in the huddle, let alone
the plays,'' Crockett said.
</P>
<P>
   Players on injured reserve count against a team's spending
limit, so practices have involved less contact in the past five
seasons because coaches fear injuries. Such basic skills as
blocking and tackling suffer because players get far less contact.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't simulate game speed, and you're too afraid to
hit,'' Minnesota defensive coordinator Foge Fazio said. ``There are
great offensive players in the league, but we've made them even
better because we don't know how to tackle. And when you get down
to it, that's a function of free agency and the (salary) cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Money might be the root of the league's problems, but it isn't
the only factor that has contributed to the decline in quality. A
few others:
</P>
<P>
   _ The game suffers from a dearth of quality at quarterback, the
game's most critical position.
</P>
<P>
   A team like New Orleans must ``go crap-shooting,'' club
president Bill Kuharich said, every time an experienced quarterback
is cut by another team. Two weeks ago, the Saints claimed
fourth-year veteran Kerry Collins off waivers barely a week after
he had told Carolina coach Dom Capers that his heart no longer was
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, there are just 10 teams in this league that
have a decent situation at quarterback,'' said former NFL
quarterback Joe Theismann, now an analyst for ESPN. ``So that means
there are 20 teams that don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for every Favre, there are first-round failures such as
Heath Shuler, Rick Mirer and Trent Dilfer and underachievers such
as Scott Mitchell and Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a quarterback-driven game,'' Green Bay general manager
Ron Wolf said. ``And sometimes the quarterback will drive you
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Owners are increasingly less patient with head coaches. It is
a trend fueled by the appearance of expansion teams Jacksonville
and Carolina in the 1996 conference title games in just their
second seasons of existence.
</P>
<P>
   Entering this season, the 30 coaches had an average tenure of
2.5 years with their current clubs. No coach in the league has been
with his current team longer than 10 years, and just four have been
in place since before 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners are a lot quicker on the trigger now; they want
results,'' former NFL coach Chuck Knox said. ``What they never
understand is that every time you bring in a new guy, you're
starting over. The great leap forward is negated by the step
backwards you take while a coach is implementing his system and
getting his players in place.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Young players, getting more money than ever before, aren't as
driven to succeed anymore. In the era of $11 million signing
bonuses, a player is sometimes set for life before he ever plays a
game.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Atlanta Falcons safety Elbert Shelley, a player
of modest abilities who lasted 10 seasons in the league by
excelling on special teams, noted the reluctance of young players
to perform the NFL's ultimate ``grunt'' work.
</P>
<P>
   At training camp this summer, San Francisco defensive end Chris
Doleman conceded that the only reason he's still playing at age 37
is that the 49ers have been unable to find young players to
supplant him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way I should still be playing, but the quality of
the younger players coming into the league really is down,''
Doleman said. ``And that's trickled down to the point where it's
affected the overall level of play.

 &HT;    Man arrested, expected to draw 4 murder charges for hotel
slayings
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A man arrested for speeding about 3 a.m. Saturday in
Memphis, Tenn., is expected to be charged with four counts of
murder in the triple homicide at a downtown Atlanta hotel two weeks
ago and the death of a man in a College Park motel three days
earlier. After two weeks of intensive and often frustrating
investigation of the killings, Atlanta police got a call from the
Shelby County sheriff's department in the early hours Saturday,
saying they had in custody a man who had in his car drivers'
licenses and credit cards belonging to some of the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The man was identified as Harry Lee Johnson, 31, possibly of
Stone Mountain, Ga., but police said they aren't sure that's his
real name. Police said they also found in his car a .45 caliber
handgun, which is the same caliber as the gun used to kill all four
victims, and a small amount of marijuana and cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police were preparing murder charges and four charges of
armed robbery Saturday, and seeking search warrants for Johnson's
car, which they planned to bring to Atlanta. Atlanta-area homicide
detectives and investigators went to Memphis on Saturday to
question Johnson, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Police Chief Beverly Harvard announced the arrest at a
press conference Saturday afternoon. Harvard said the man, who
remains in a Memphis jail until he can be extradited, fits the
general description of a man who appears on two pieces of hotel
surveillance tape taken the day of the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a bizarre homicide in the middle of downtown,''
Harvard said, ``and it was major for Atlanta. Anytime you have a
development like this, you feel tremendous relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerrold Shropshire, 50, of Altamonte Springs, Fla.; Ronald
Gutkowski, 51, of Leesburg, Fla.; and Phillip Dover, 31, of
Gainesville, were found shot to death Oct. 18 in a room on the 24th
floor of the Atlanta Hilton and Towers. All three worked in the
trucking industry and Dover came to Atlanta to meet Shropshire and
Gutkowski, friends and co-workers from suburban Orlando, because
the three men planned to attend the Atlanta Falcons-New Orleans
Saints football game that Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Three days earlier, Ladaris Hawkins, 19, was shot in the face at
a Days Inn on Old National Highway in College Park. He died on the
way to a hospital. All four victims were found wearing only their
underwear and had been shot more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Johnson also had a credit card belonging to Linda
Forest Reid, of Greenville, S.C., who was the victim of a robbery
at a Cobb County Hilton hotel Oct. 11, but was not harmed. She was
in Atlanta for all women's Christian conference.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said Memphis deputies called her early Saturday to ask
about the credit card.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been suspecting he's the one all along,'' said her
husband, Charles Reid, referred to the suspected connection between
his wife's robbery and the Atlanta and College Park killings.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby County sheriff's deputies stopped Johnson speeding
through a construction site off I-40 east of Memphis just after 3
a.m. Saturday. They asked to search his car. He agreed. The search
turned up Gutkowski's driver's license and credit cards, Dover's
driver's license, Hawkins' driver's license and Reid's credit
cards, Atlanta police said.
</P>
<P>
   They called Reid, said Atlanta police Maj. Mickey Lloyd. She
told the deputies about the Hilton murders and the deputies then
called Atlanta police, Lloyd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, we're very pleased that the police did
their job, we're very relieved,'' said Jeanne Datz, Hilton Hotels
spokeswoman in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police initially believed the Hilton killings were
motivated by illegal drugs. Now they say they aren't sure of the
motive.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since Alberto Salazar's last victory in 1982, U.S.
runners have largely been also-rans in the New York City Marathon
while winners have come from New Zealand, Italy, Kenya, Britain,
Tanzania, Mexico, South Africa, Norway, Poland, Australia, Germany
and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   That foreign runners should perform so well in America's biggest
marathon simply underscores the larger story of the race's vibrant
ethnic roots in New York. What the city's ethnic groups contributed
was a vital marathon culture that emphasized widespread
participation and personal achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, well before Fred Lebow _ a Romanian-Jewish immigrant
himself _ transformed the New York City Marathon into a major
international sports spectacle, running and marathoning in New York
were activities primarily supported by various ethnic groups. The
first great marathon champions were Irish and Italian. In 1908,
John J. Hayes, an Irish-American New Yorker, won the Olympic
marathon in London, but only after Dorando Pietri, an Italian who
finished ahead of Hayes, was disqualified because he had been aided
by officials.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York City, home to large Irish and Italian
populations, the disputed Olympic finish set up a professional
match race between Hayes and Pietri. On Nov. 25, 1908, the two ran
on a 26.2-mile course in Madison Square Garden, and Pietri won.
</P>
<P>
   From November 1908 through May 1909, former amateur runners such
as Pietri, Hayes, Thomas Longboat (an American Indian and winner of
the 1907 Boston Marathon), Henri St. Yves, a Frenchman, and others
were paid to compete in foot races over the 26.2-mile distance.
Intense gambling accompanied these marathons, which drew large,
vocal crowds from the city's ethnic communities. The 26.2-mile
distance was accepted as the standard for the marathon probably
because it was contested so often in the New York City area during
these years.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 26, 1908, the day after the Pietri-Hayes matchup, 4,000
spectators watched 145 amateur runners start the second Yonkers
Marathon; 20,000 fans packed the town's Empire City track for the
finish. James F. Crowley won, saying, ``I did it for the
Irish-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also amateur marathons the day after Christmas, on
New Year's Day, on Lincoln's Birthday, on Washington's Birthday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1925, Bricklayer Bill Kennedy of Port Chester, N.Y., who had
won the Boston Marathon in 1917, and Tommy McNamara, a Port Chester
sportswriter, staged a local marathon on Columbus Day, Oct. 12, to
honor the town's Italian-Americans. It started from Columbus
Circle, not far from the finish line of the current New York City
Marathon, then ran up Central Park West and through the Bronx to
end in Port Chester.
</P>
<P>
   The Port Chester Marathon became an annual event that lasted
through 1941, with teams of African-Americans and Jewish runners
distinguishing themselves year after year. In 1928 Arthur Gavrin,
a recent Jewish immigrant from Poland, won.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish presence in metropolitan marathons reached a peak in
the early 1930s, when the coach Max Silver put together a winning
team of long-distance runners for the German-American Athletic
Club, guiding them to victory in the 1935 Amateur Athletic Union
national marathon championship. Among ``Max Silver's Boys'' were
Bill Steiner and Joe Kleinerman, now registrar of the New York Road
Runners Club. But when the German-American Athletic Club's leaders
openly acknowledged Nazi sympathies, the Jewish athletes left for
other clubs, and the championship marathon team scattered.
</P>
<P>
   In 1936, three Harlem businessmen, Joe Yancey, Robert Douglas
and William Culbreath, started a track club for men and boys who
did not have the experience or membership fees to join one of the
city's other clubs. The New York Pioneer Club accepted all boys
regardless of athletic ability.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the Pioneers, who began as a wedge against segregation for
primarily black and minority runners, attracted so many white
athletes who wanted to train with them _ especially Jewish athletes
faced with discrimination at other clubs _ that by 1942 they were
officially integrated. By 1945 the New York Pioneer Club had won a
substantial number of individual Metropolitan and National AAU
Championships as well as many team awards.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights remained a bedrock of the Pioneers' agenda. In
1946, club members voiced criticism of the AAU National Track and
Field Championships in San Antonio because black athletes were not
permitted to stay at the same hotels as white athletes.
</P>
<P>
   As an integrated team, the Pioneers also faced residential
segregation at the 1950 AAU Nationals, where they could not stay
together at any hotel in Maryland or in the dormitories of the
University of Maryland, where the meet was held. The New York
Pioneers Club 800-meter runner, Roscoe Lee Browne (now a television
and movie actor), arranged lodging for them at Lincoln University
in Pennsylvania, where he was teaching, and the Pioneers commuted
to the Nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Corbitt was a member of the Pioneers when he became the
first African-American Olympic marathoner in 1952. The Pioneers won
the team title in the AAU National Marathon championships in 1954
and 1955 and took the 1955 Boston Marathon trophy with an all-black
team. Corbitt later became the first president of the New York Road
Runners Club. Nat Cirulnick, another Pioneer, also served as road
runners club's president.
</P>
<P>
   In the ethnic history of the New York City Marathon, some of the
runners were good, some were very, very good, but most ran the
distance for their own reasons. Through their efforts, New York
City led the way in reorganizing race procedures and logistics to
include ever-increasing numbers of runners, and in celebrating all
runners regardless of finishing time. And the New York City
Marathon has remained true to its roots in that fully a third of
the field come from countries around the world.

considered the favorite in the race for the Teamsters presidency,

recently at 4C Food in Brooklyn. Though Leedhams' main opponent
James Hoffa, predicts a decisive victory, some fears remain in the
Hoffa camp that Leedham, might pull off an upset. Leedham began as
a long shot, but his tireless campaigning has turned the contest
into a real race, many Teamsters say. (Edward Keating/New York

Testaverde is surrounded by a support system of people who care for
him and put him in comfortable situations on and off the field.

his seat in the House, representing the 6th District of

southern coast, checking a list to see if they will be moved to a
different camp. Italians increasingly view the waves of refugees
and would-be immigrants reaching their shores from Albania, Iraq
and Kosovo, as a national emergency and a direct local threat. The
goal of most of the refugees is not to stay in Italy, but to reach
countries in northern Europe. (James Hill/New York Times Photo)

increasingly view the waves of refugees and would-be immigrants
reaching their shores from Albania, Iraq and Kosovo, as a national
emergency and a direct local threat. In this seaside resort where
unemployment has reached 23 percent, and the mafia is deeply
rooted, immigrants are viewed as stealing jobs and bringing in more

subdistrict family planning center. Ms. Lingjun, 29, would really
like to have a second child, a girl. ``When the time comes, if we
really want another and we can afford it, we will pay,'' she says.
Slowly but surely, the tenor of family planning in China has
changed. The government has quietly started urging its workers to
soften their approach, hoping to improve its often tense
relationship with Chinese women. (Elisabeth Rosenthal/New York

-- John Jefferson, 52, says he is not particularly surprised at the
news that he is a descendant of President Thomas Jefferson and his
slave, Sally Hemings. ``I've known it practically all my life.''
John Jefferson's Y chromosome matched blood samples taken from the
lineal descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field Jefferson. DNA tests
performed on the descendants of President Jefferson's family and
Sally Hemings, offer new evidence that the third president of the
United States fathered at least one of her children. (Michael

   LAGAMBLE _ New Orleans_There's a favorite saying among casino
opponents here: Bring gambling into Louisiana and you'll be
throwing gasoline on a bonfire. Their prediction seems to be coming
true. It has been a busy October at the federal courthouse in Baton
Rouge. Three associates of former Gov. Edwin Edwards have copped
guilty pleas and made deals with the U.S. Attorney's Office, and in
the process have revealed lurid details of payoffs, extortion and
illegal influence at three casinos. Also this month, two members of
the state's revamped gambling board_a supposedly squeaky clean
regulatory agency set up by Gov. Mike Foster_were named in the
federal investigation of Edwards. It is now well known that 13 of
the 15 riverboat casino licenses awarded here went to friends and
associates of Edwards. (Rochell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   TRIPLE _BUDDIES _ ATLANTA _ Gerrold Shropshire and Ronald
Gutkowski had a friendship that crossed boundaries of race and

trucking business, loved football and loved to cook. They ate
together every day at a grocery store in Okahumpka, Florida, but
they lived in different worlds: Ronald's world was an all-white
retirement community where Sunday brought an occasional trip to a
Catholic Church dominated by elderly Northerners. Gerrold bounced
from apartment to apartment in Orlando, and his life outside work
revolved almost completely around a black Baptist Church where the
pastor is accompanied most mornings by drums and pianos and a choir
that sways and claps and shouts. (Bixler, Atlanta

   PBP-BLOOD-BANK _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Donors give their blood
to the Palm Beach Blood Bank for free. After processing the blood,
the blood bank sells it to hospitals and other medical
institutions, taking in millions of dollars a year. Yet, blood bank
CEO John Flynn and his nine-member board of directors won't allow
the public to see how the money is spent, even though several of
the directors admit they don't examine the expenditures in any
detail. Non-profit organizations don't have to open their books.
But those heavily involved with the public often do when presented
with a legitimate request. Jerry Haarman, treasurer of America's
Blood Centers, a national organization of independent blood
centers, said he believes blood banks have an ethical
responsibility to open their books because they are supposed to be
operating in the public interest and, like other nonprofit
organizations, they don't pay taxes. ``I submit to you that if you
are truly a community blood center then you have an obligation to
the public,'' said Haarman, who is CEO of a Minneapolis-based blood
bank, Memorial Blood Centers of Minnesota. ``All your records
should be open for public inspection.'' (Horine, Palm Beach Post).

like Flynn, aren't physicians. Flynn, 56, refused to talk with a
reporter about his income _ $14,833.34 a month in salary and
$12,500 in quarterly bonus payments _ which he listed on a
financial affidavit in response to a divorce suit recently filed by
his wife. (Horine, Palm Beach Post)

   TEX-POWERDEREG _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Deregulation forever changed

   MILMED _ DAYTON, Ohio _ In the year since the Dayton Daily News
series on military medicine, the Department of Defense has
tightened oversight of doctors who practice in the military. But
the changes do not address some of the major findings in the
newspaper series. About 1.7 million active-duty military members
and their dependents overseas cannot collect damages in a lawsuit.
And military doctors still do not have to be licensed in the states
where they practice, nor do they have to carry malpractice
insurance. U.S. Sen. Mike DeWine said he would consider giving
military members the right to sue the government in medical
malpractice cases. ``I don't know how you morally justify making
people in the military second-class citizens: not being able to
file lawsuits other citizens can file,'' DeWine said. ``We should
look to protect those in the military. They are the ones who
protect us.'' (Carollo/Nesmith, Dayton Daily News) MOVED

   HAITI-POLITICS-$ADV01 _ PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti _ Anxiety is
building over Haiti, a ticking time bomb set to explode if a
political stalemate that has paralyzed the government isn't
resolved. The United States has pumped hundreds of millions of
dollars into this country since 1994, and there are still 500 U.S.
troops stationed here. Four years ago, hopes were running high when
President Clinton sent 20,000 troops to Haiti to overthrow a
military regime and restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to
power. But, today, the situation couldn't be more desperate. Courts
are corrupt. Drug trafficking is rampant. Unemployment is at more
than 60 percent. In a poll conducted by the U.S. Embassy,
three-fourths of those surveyed said they would leave Haiti if they
could. Already, many tried to flee to Florida in recent weeks,
driven away by growing poverty. Meanwhile, a 16-month political
squabble has left Aristide's successor, Rene Preval, with little
authority and the country with no functioning government.
Parliamentary elections that were scheduled for November have been
indefinitely postponed. (Emling, Cox News Service).

   w/HAITI-GEORGES-$ADV01 _ PORT AU PRINCE, Haiti _ One village was
completely swept away by water. Another was wiped out by mudslides.
A month after Hurricane Georges ravaged poverty-stricken Haiti, the
effects of the storm are becoming clear. More than 400 people are
dead. Thousands of homes have been destroyed. More than 56,000 cows
and other animals have been killed. Agricultural damage is
estimated at $300 million, with hundreds of thousands of acres of
crops disappearing under chest-high water. As a result, Haiti has
become more dependent than ever on foreign emergency aid. Relief,
fortunately, has poured in from a myriad of sources, ranging from
Atlanta-based CARE to the city of Surfside in Florida. (Emling, Cox

   RUSSIA-MIDDLECLASS _ MOSCOW _ Alexander and Lilia Kazintseva
were young and upwardly mobile Russians enjoying all that the
post-Soviet economy had to offer: new furnishings for their
apartment and country house, vacations abroad and a private tutor
to teach English to their nine-year-old son, Anton. Now, the good
times have vanished. He lost his job as a corporate marketing
director. She believes her layoff as an executive headhunter is
just a matter of time. The brighter future is on hold. Russia's
economic crisis is squeezing out the middle class. While small, the
middle class was the great hope for the staying power of democracy
and reforms _ how you gonna send them back to the Soviet days after
they've seen cable TV and Disney World? (Holmes, Cox News Service).

When demand jumps at the inevitable end of today's worldwide
economic downswing, gasoline prices will start going up again at
the pump. But adjustments made by our government, other
governments, Wall Street and the oil industry should prevent the
kind of supply shock that led to gasoline lines in 1974 and 1979.
If you are forced in the next few years to wait in line at a
service station for gasoline, it is less likely to be caused by a
supply shortage than it is to be caused (No joke!) by Y2K glitches
in the innards of some gasoline pumps. (Mollison, Cox News

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For her first New York City Marathon in 1994, Tegla
Loroupe of Kenya received some simple, prescient advice from Anne
Roberts, the race coordinator:
</P>
<P>
   Start slowly. Don't worry about the leaders as long as you can
see them. You will be able to catch them later on.
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe, who had never run a race of 26.2 miles, followed the
advice so perfectly and stealthily that the front-runners never
even saw her in the final miles as she surged into the lead.
</P>
<P>
   With its bridges and laborious hills in Central Park, Sunday's
New York City Marathon certainly will not produce another world
record for Loroupe, who ran an unprecedented 2 hours 20 minutes 47
seconds in April in Rotterdam, Netherlands. Nor are there likely to
be four men breaking 2:08, as there were three weeks ago at the
Chicago Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Records are set on flat courses like Rotterdam and Berlin, not
on the difficult, potholed terrain of New York, where it is more
important to win than to get an impressive time. Perhaps more than
any other major marathon, New York requires as much strategy as
speed, and can resemble a chess match as much as a foot race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more about strategy here than other races because it's
New York and because everybody wants to win,'' said German Silva of
Mexico, who, like Loroupe, won in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Said Franziska Rochat-Moser of Switzerland, who won the women's
race in 1997: ``It is important to win. If you want to make a good
time, don't come to New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The course offers the same treachery for elite runners in the
field of 32,000 as for first-timers looking to finish within four
hours, or simply to finish. It is easy to succumb to the siren's
song of cheers along Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn and along First
Avenue in Manhattan. More than one favorite has been lured into a
premature surge at 16 or 17 miles, only to be left dehydrated and
exhausted for the grinding finish.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Loroupe was on world-record pace at one point, but her
start had been suicidally fast, and she crumpled into seventh
place. A year ago, she made the opposite mistake, starting too
conservatively. She was dropped by Rochat-Moser at 21 miles and
finished seventh again. This year, she has focused on her speed,
running a personal best of 14:57 for 5,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned my lesson,'' Loroupe said. ``This year I'm going to
run my own race. I'm not going to watch other people. I was
watching last year and I was the loser.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's race was essentially a death sprint last year as a
pair of Kenyans, Shem Kororia and Kenneth Cheruiyot, attempted to
destroy the rest of the field for teammate Joseph Chebet. Cheruiyot
went through the half marathon in a blistering 1:03:29 then he and
Kororia dropped out beyond 20 miles. Though they deny it, Kororia
and Cheruiyot have been accused of running a cynical race, never
intending to finish. Silva tried to stay with the Kenyans, but he
paid dearly in Central Park, suffering severe dehydration and
finishing fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it was me they were trying to destroy,'' Silva
said of Kororia and Cheruiyot, who, like him, represent the Fila
shoe company. ``I understand when they have designated rabbits, but
when you don't know, it bothers you and it damages the field. But
it's a challenge and you have to decide what to do. You can either
finish in the medals or you can finish the way I did.''
</P>
<P>
   The group of Kenyans representing Fila are coached by Gabriele
Rosa, an Italian doctor. This year, Rosa said, he believes that a
pace of 64 minutes might be more suitable than the 63 minutes of
last year. Chebet could not maintain the searing pace, losing to
another Kenyan, John Kagwe. Chebet said that all of the Kenyans in
the Fila group intended to finish this year.
</P>
<P>
   A slower first half will conserve energy for the enervating,
decisive second half. Still, Rosa intends to push the pace. He
believes that a time of 2:07:40 is possible on a day that is
expected to be overcast with temperatures in the 50s. That would
shatter the course record of 2:08:01 set in 1989 by Juma Ikangaa of
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``My idea is to push the pace for everybody,'' Rosa said. ``This
is a long-distance race for marathoners, not half-marathoners. If
you don't push early, it is better for the half-marathoners.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His biggest concern is Abel Anton of Spain, the 1997 world
marathon champion who prefers to sit behind the leaders and make
his break near the end with a ferocious kick. The idea is to melt
his legs so that he will not have a passing gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very fast the last kilometer,'' Rosa said of Anton.
``You must fight him and push the pace.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe ran the second-fastest race ever in New York last year,
winning in 2:08:12, despite having to stop twice to tie his loose
shoelaces. This year, he will not run in a pair of new shoes. He
said his strategy would not change because of Anton's kick, but he
also candidly admitted that he was not particularly confident about
his chances.
</P>
<P>
   Kagwe fully knows how any tactical miscalculation can be
disastrous. Two years ago, he keyed on more seasoned marathoners
such as Cosmas Ndeti of Kenya and Martin Fiz of Spain, but they
were not among the leaders when Giacomo Leone of Italy put his foot
to the accelerator in the final two miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has expectations; everybody has come here expecting
to win,'' Kagwe said. ``Everybody has some tension. You cannot say
you have confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important than confidence in New York is patience. In
most marathons, the final miles are flat or even slightly downhill.
In New York, the hills come at 23{ miles, when the race enters
Central Park and the body enters a state of extreme fatigue. The
key is to relax for the first three quarters of the race, Silva
said. He was composed enough in 1994 to win despite making a wrong
turn into Central Park in the final mile.
</P>
<P>
   Just remember, said Grete Waitz of Norway, who won the women's
race nine times, most winners in New York come from behind late
instead of pulling away early.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first 18 or 20 miles are just transportation,'' Waitz
said. ``Then you really start running.''

recently at 4C Food in Brooklyn. Though Leedhams' main opponent
James Hoffa, predicts a decisive victory, some fears remain in the
Hoffa camp that Leedham, might pull off an upset. Leedham began as
a long shot, but his tireless campaigning has turned the contest
into a real race, many Teamsters say. (Edward Keating/New York

Testaverde is surrounded by a support system of people who care for
him and put him in comfortable situations on and off the field.

increasingly view the waves of refugees and would-be immigrants

like to have a second child, a girl. ``When the time comes, if we
really want another and we can afford it, we will pay,'' she says.

John Jefferson's Y chromosome matched blood samples taken from the
lineal descendants of Jefferson's uncle, Field Jefferson. DNA tests

 FRANCIS X. LARKIN, 71, PRESIDENT OF FIELDCREST MILLS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Francis X. Larkin, who built a career in home
furnishings and helped lead Fieldcrest Mills Inc., a maker of
home-furnishing textiles based in Eden, N.C., died last Monday at
Brick Memorial Hospital in Brick, N.J. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said the Frank Halpin's Funeral Home in
Bloomfield, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A native of New York City, Larkin lived in Montclair, N.J., for
40 years and helped run Fieldcrest from offices in New York until
he retired in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated from Fordham University with a bachelor's degree in
business administration and attended graduate school at New York
University.
</P>
<P>
   After serving in the Marine Corps during World War II, Larkin
joined Fieldcrest in 1956 and worked his way up through the ranks.
He was president of Karastan Rug Mills, then a division of
Fieldcrest, from 1975 until he became president and chief operating
officer of Fieldcrest in 1981. He played a major role in the
reorganization of the company, now Fieldcrest Cannon Inc., a unit
of Pillowtex Corp., and retired in 1988 as vice chairman, president
and chief operating officer.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin had been a trustee of the Institute of Textile Technology
and a director of the American Textile Institute. He was also
involved in and contributed to many projects to help the poor and
the sick. He was a former board member of the American Life League
and was a recipient of the distinguished community service award
from Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin is survived by his wife, Patricia; a son, Francis X.
Larkin Jr., of Boise, Idaho; three daughters, Mary Patricia Caputo
of Bristol, Conn., Ann Therese Smith of Lawrenceville, N.J., and
Elizabeth Ann Larkin of New York City; a brother, Edward Larkin of
Nashua, N.H.; and five granddaughters.

 &HT;    Glenn goes for repitition in his menu
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney and Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas_Food was a major experiment when
John Glenn made America's first orbital space flight in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   More than 36 years later, it's almost an afterthought for him.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has the simplest, most redundant menu of Discovery's seven
astronauts, mainly because he realized during the lengthy tasting
process that he was letting his intense enthusiasm for training
turn his food choices into a bigger chore than it needed to be, his
daughter said.
</P>
<P>
   While some crew members carefully selected each meal and snack
for every day of the mission, Glenn listed dishes for three days of
meals and simply repeated them throughout the flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was working so hard at it he realized that he was losing
the fun of it,'' Lyn Glenn said, ``and he realized that he liked so
much the first two or three days that he'd chosen, that he was just
going to repeat that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, it means the oatmeal that gooed up his
eyeglasses during breakfast on Friday will confront him again today
and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   His dish of choice seems to be rehydrated shrimp cocktail, a
popular item with all the crew. It's spiced up with horseradish
sauce because food tends to taste blander in space, although in a
special radio link Saturday Glenn told young people at the Center
of Science and Industry in Columbus, Ohio, that ``everything tastes
very good to me so far.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the scheduled items, crew members are free to
snack on M&AMP;Ms and other goodies that are repacked into clear
plastic bags in single-serving portions for use on the space
shuttle. Glenn is a disciplined eater, but he also has a sweet
tooth with a taste for chocolate. He first noticed that some space
shuttle stowage drawers are packed upside down, since technically
there is no up or down in space, when he was learning where the
sweets are kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (snack) drawer was of great interest to him,'' his
daughter said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   But forget about Tang, the powdered orange drink that gained
fame as the beverage of astronauts during the 1960s. Glenn is
washing down his meals with peach-apricot drink, orange-mango
drink, apple cider, lemonade and grape drink.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the food Glenn took in his tiny Mercury capsule was
intended to nourish science, not him. Glenn didn't need to eat on
his four-hour, 55-minute flight, but scientists wanted to find out
if eating would even be possible in space. Some worried that food
would be hard to swallow in weightless conditions and might collect
in the throat.
</P>
<P>
   So Glenn carried a tube of applesauce and squeezed one swallow's
worth into his mouth during the weightless part of the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Eating turned out to be easy. Getting food into the mouth is the
tricky part. Some of the potentially messy dishes Glenn is spooning
out of pouches or plastic containers include scrambled eggs,
pudding, beef stroganoff and creamed spinach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite easy to swallow, but you have to be very careful
you don't let the food get loose or it floats all over the place,''
Glenn told students at COSI. ``You have to learn how to eat and
drink a little bit differently up here and don't let things get
loose.''

 &HT;    Students talk to Discovery crew via satellite
 &HT;    By Mike Wagner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Until this past summer, T.J. Seabrooks didn't
know the difference between John Glenn and John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   But on Saturday, the 14-year-old Columbus high school student
was chatting with the world's most famous astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrooks' brief encounter with Glenn had the freshman dreaming
of directing future space flights from NASA's Mission Control in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's cool that we get to learn about other worlds
besides our own and John Glenn is teaching us more about space then
any book could,'' said Seabrooks, a student at Columbus Alternative
High School. ``How many other kids can say they talked with an
astronaut in space today?''
</P>
<P>
   On their third day in space on the shuttle Discovery, Glenn and
Commander Curt Brown took a break from their experiments to answer
questions from students at the Center Of Science and Industry
(COSI) in Columbus, Ohio. A radio satellite set up by NASA made it
possible for the astronauts to answer about 40 questions from
students in Columbus, Arlington VA., and in Glenn's hometown of New
Concord, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The Discovery is loaded with five other astronauts and 83
science experiments, including several that will focus on the
77-year-old Glenn and the way his aged body reacts to space.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's age was also a popular subject when he was fielding
questions from the students. At one point, Glenn laughed out loud
when asked if he felt younger in space.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I feel younger all the time, which is one of the
reasons I came up here,'' said Glenn, who along with Brown, had
little trouble receiving and responding to the pre-arranged
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been banging my head on things all the time, but we just
had a perfect view of the Bahama Islands and sights like that will
continue to keep me young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus students, representing five area schools, worked in
groups of three and spent several days preparing the questions,
which focused mainly on Glenn, the space ship, and eating in space.
</P>
<P>
   The students packed a small COSI room and intensely listened to
each response from Glenn and Brown. Students were amazed to know
that the Discovery shuttle had traveled above the earth from
Mexico, across Florida, and onto the east side of Africa during the
30-minute question and answer session. Brown told the students the
shuttle travels at a rate of five miles per second.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something that we can tell our kids about someday
because John Glenn going back to space is something that will be
taught in history classes forever,'' said Alysia Stevenson, a
Briggs High School student, who asked Glenn a question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we can say that we were a part of history too,'' she said.

 &HT;    Discovery mission smooth...except for a few bumps and pokes
 &HT;    By Timothy R. Gaffney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHNSON SPACE CENTER, Texas _ Even drawing blood samples didn't
seem to faze John Glenn as Discovery sailed through Saturday with
only minor problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great place up here and I'm having a great time,'' he
told young people on earth during an educational radio link.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been bumping my head a lot on things as I float around up
here but that's alright, that's part of the course up here.''
</P>
<P>
   The 77-year-old said the view of Florida and the Bahama Islands
as they glided 340 miles above them was ``enough to keep you young
up here if you weren't when you got here.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn has said he hasn't suffered space adaptation syndrome,
which afflicts about half of space shuttle astronauts with a brief
period of nausea during the first day or two of a mission. Life
Sciences Mission Scientist John Charles said he didn't know if
Glenn took anti-nausea drugs that are available to astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn drew blood and urine samples and swallowed a chemical
tracer as part of an experiment to study muscle loss during
spaceflight. He also worked out on an exercise bicycle, among other
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Sparks, one of Glenn's senate aides, said Glenn's voice
sounded good during his radio link with students.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sounds like John Glenn on a great day,'' Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   Work on Discovery's 83 experiments seemed to be going well,
Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had almost no air-ground comments (about the
experiments,) and that suggests that things are going smoothly,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   One experiment was canceled when packages of chemicals inside a
glove box began leaking, flight director Jeff Bantle said. The
glove box is a sealed container with rubber gloves that allows
items inside it to be handled.
</P>
<P>
   The crew also replaced a new water supply system with an old one
after reporting the water tasted ``a little funny,'' Bantle said,
adding that Mission Commander Curt Brown compared it to water that
has been in a canteen for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle astronauts drink water from the orbiter's fuel cells.
The fuel cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to generate electrical
power, producing water as a by-product. Iodine is added to the
water to prevent bacterial growth, Bantle said, and the supply
system uses a plastic material to filter out the iodine.
</P>
<P>
   The system that drew the complaints is a new one that has not
been flown before. Since it was new, an old system was also brought
along, and the crew switched back to it, Bantle said.
</P>
<P>
   The crew spent part of Saturday preparing for today's deployment
of Spartan 201, a 2,978 satellite that will fly free of the shuttle
for two days to gather data about the sun. Mission specialists
Scott Parazynski and Stephen Robinson are scheduled to set it free
with the shuttle's robot arm.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment is scheduled for 2 p.m.

INJURY-PLAGUED JOCKEY ROMERO WAITS FOR HIS CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Almost by its nature, thoroughbred racing is a sport in which
moments of ecstasy are tempered by frequent disappointments and
occasional tragedies.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 15-year history of the Breeders' Cup _ horse racing's
championship series _ no athlete has represented the emotional
extremes better than jockey Randy Romero.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Romero rode Personal Ensign to a career-climaxing
victory in the Breeders' Cup Distaff _ also at Churchill Downs _ in
what was perhaps the most dramatic moment in the event's history.
</P>
<P>
   The pendulum swung two years later, also in the Distaff, when
Romero was a key player in the Breeders' Cup's most catastrophic
moment. He was aboard Go for Wand at Belmont Park when the filly
broke a front leg in midstretch while fighting for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Now 40, the injury-prone Romero _ yet another riding product of
the south Louisiana bayous _ is trying to prove himself again with
another comeback. He is still searching for a mount in Saturday's
Breeders' Cup races at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't look like he will get one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always next year,'' Romero said.
</P>
<P>
   But even if he never gets another big-race mount, Romero said he
will be content with memories that no one can take away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very fortunate I was able to ride those kind of
horses,'' said Romero, who has recorded more than 4,000 career
victories. ``One was the happiest day of my life, and the other was
the saddest day.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal Ensign, who carried screws in a hind leg bone after an
injury early in her career, retired after the Distaff with a 13-0
record. The Breeders' Cup media guide describes her as the first
major American thoroughbred in 80 years to retire undefeated and
sound.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the manner in which she won the Distaff added to
her legend.
</P>
<P>
   On that November 1988 day at Churchill Downs, the weather was
gloomy and the track was a sticky mud that Personal Ensign didn't
seem to like. It also didn't help that she was squeezed between
horses bending into the first turn and knocked back in the pack.
</P>
<P>
   More than halfway through the 1 1-8 mile race, Personal Ensign
was languishing eight lengths from the lead and clearly in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't handling the track at all,'' Romero recalls. ``She
was struggling so bad down on the inside that I got her to the
outside where she could maybe get some more momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Personal Ensign began a slow advance around the second turn. But
in midstretch, she still was staring at a four-length deficit, and
running on a clear lead was Winning Colors, the 3-year-old filly
that had won that spring's Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   As Winning Colors faltered in the waning yards, Personal Ensign
seemed to shift into a higher gear as Romero pumped vigorously on
her neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know if I was going to get there in time,'' Romero
said. ``I was just hoping.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the middle of the track, Personal Ensign appeared to
cross the finish simultaneously with Winning Colors.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I knew we'd won it,'' Romero said. ``Even if was just a
half-inch, I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero and trainer Shug McGaughey struggled to hold back tears
after Personal Ensign's victory.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the postrace Distaff scene was just as moving,
only in a more sorrowful way.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Romero found himself on the lead with two-time
Eclipse Award champion Go for Wand. That New York-based filly
hooked up with veteran California mare Bayakoa from the start, and
the two battled as a team, never more than a half-length apart and
their eyes ablaze with determination.
</P>
<P>
   According to Romero, jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. on Bayakoa tried
to intimidate Go for Wand by crowding her as much as racing rules
and safety would allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RBayakoa\S was right on the side of my boot, and I could feel
it,'' Romero said. ``I thought I had it, though, because I hadn't
pressed on my horse yet, and \RPincay\S was pressing on his.''
</P>
<P>
   For a little more than a mile, the 1990 Distaff might have been
the best Breeders' Cup race of all. Every time Bayakoa surged
forward in search of a second consecutive Distaff victory, Go for
Wand matched the effort and clung to a narrow lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the race collapsed in a heap 100 yards from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   In a split-second, Go for Wand's right front leg snapped and she
collapsed, plummeting Romero headfirst into the track with no time
to react.
</P>
<P>
   Romero remembers seeing the dizzying blur of motion as he
somersaulted. When his eyes regained focus, his first sight was
exactly what he didn't want to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw out of the corner of my eye that she had gotten up, and
her leg was dangling,'' Romero said. ``She just overextended
herself. It happened because she was trying so damn hard. I really
believe that in my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   As a horrified nation watched on TV, Go for Wand was quickly
caught, wrestled to the ground, and given an injection to end her
suffering.
</P>
<P>
   Romero got back in the saddle four races later to ride
sixth-place Izvestia in the Breeders' Cup Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of adrenalin flowing,'' he said. ``I guess I was
in shock. The pain came later that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Romero knew his shoulder _ the one that absorbed the force of
his landing _ was hurt. What he didn't know was that the Go for
Wand episode would be only the beginning of a seven-year injury
odyssey that might be unparalleled in professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Because X-rays proved negative, Romero returned to riding in
Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   But he was in constant pain, and a magnetic resonance imaging
exam would discover that his shoulder had numerous hairline
fractures. He was out for three months, but when he returned at
Florida's Gulfstream Park, he went down in another spill and
severely broke an elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Romero described his elbow injury as a ``three-year nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Screws used to stabilize it were too big, and he couldn't bend
the arm. After the screws were removed, the elbow rebroke. Another
four months in a cast. More physical therapy. Eventually, bone was
grafted from his hip into the elbow.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a knee injury, a broken pelvis and broken ribs when a
horse kicked him in the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in his career, in 1983, he was severely burned over much
of his upper body in a freak accident in Oaklawn Park's jockey
quarters. He was trying to lose a few pounds in an antiquated sweat
box, and his alcohol-covered torso brushed against an exposed heat
bulb and caught fire. He nearly died, but returned four months
later to win with his comeback mount at Louisiana Downs.
</P>
<P>
   He numbers his surgeries at ``twenty-something.'' The broken
bones he has lost count of. If he wasn't such an outstanding
athlete, you'd think he was a klutz.
</P>
<P>
   Twice over past five years, Romero decided he had absorbed
enough punishment and announced his retirement, but admits he
always wanted to keep riding.
</P>
<P>
   As he attempts to resurrect his career in Kentucky, Romero is
practically starting from scratch, even though he has demonstrated
as much courage in the face of adversity as any of the great horses
he has ridden.
</P>
<P>
   Owners and trainers want to know if he still has the burning
desire to win, and if repeated injuries have made him too careful
or ruined his natural talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never lose your talent, you lose your clientele,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Romero rides stakes filly Vivace at Churchill Downs in a race on
Saturday's Breeders' Cup undercard. But unless an unexpected mount
comes his way at the last minute, he'll watch the big races _ the
ones that have carried him to glory and agony _ on TV in the
jockeys' room lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to be out there, but what can I do?'' he said. ``I've
proven I can overcome a lot. I'll just try again next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll ride the wave and turn the page.'' \Ntagtop:Randy Moss,

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If there ever was an underdog, it is Lawrence
Klemens, a Democratic high school principal in western Pennsylvania
seeking the congressional seat of Republican incumbent Rep. Phil
English.
</P>
<P>
   Where English will spend $950,000, Klemens has a budget of at
best $15,000. English has a full-time campaign staff, a file with
7,000 donors, and $300,000 in television advertisements swamping
the Erie airwaves. Klemens operates on a shoestring. Because he
works full time, his campaigning starts at 4 p.m. He asks donors
for sticks to attach to campaign signs, and his advertising costs
nothing: It's talking.
</P>
<P>
   Klemens has virtually no chance of winning. He has received no
help from cash-strapped national party committees that are giving
money only to potential winners. He has been shunned by corporate
donors who want sure bets in Washington. Klemens is in a bind:
Without money, he cannot wage a winning campaign; unless he is seen
as a winner, he cannot get money.
</P>
<P>
   This year's House races, more than any in recent memory, are
populated with challengers like Lawrence Klemens, woefully outspent
and far behind. The fund-raising gap between incumbents and
challengers has grown to almost ridiculous proportions. Of the 435
House races, 260 incumbents, or nearly 60 percent, have 10 to 1
advantages in money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's becoming more and more impossible to defeat an incumbent
in the U.S. House because there is no money out there for
challengers,'' said Larry Makinson of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a nonprofit group that collects campaign financing data.
``Challengers have to be knocking on the doors until their arms are
falling off. In every state you can think of, the deck is stacked
in favor of the incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   In 99 races, for instance, House challengers have raised so
little money they have not even met the $5,000 threshold requiring
them to file with the Federal Election Commission. In about 100
districts, incumbents are unopposed. But that has not stopped them
from raising, on average, $400,000 per incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, of the $250 million raised by all House candidates in
this election cycle, around three-quarters, or $186 million, was
raised by incumbents, according to the Campaign Study Group, a
campaign finance research firm in Springfield, Va.
</P>
<P>
   More incumbents are seeking re-election than in any recent year.
Many veterans either retired or were defeated in the 1994 or 1996
elections. That has left fewer open seats, those considered to be
the most competitive. And with only about 40 House members facing
any serious opposition, most incumbents are expected to glide to
victory. Because everyone wants to back a winner, the bulk of
campaign donations is flowing to incumbents.
</P>
<P>
   The lopsided races span the country. In California, Democratic
Rep. Barbara Lee, who represents the Oakland-Berkeley district, has
raised more than $400,000; her Republican challenger, Claiborne
Sanders, about $10,000. In North Carolina, Rep. Sue Myrick, a
Charlotte Republican, has raised $475,000; her Democratic
challenger, Rory Blake, $15,000. And in Ohio, Democratic incumbent
Sherrod Brown of the Cleveland suburbs has $786,000; his Republican
challenger, Grace Drake, $56,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't buy the seat, I can't buy people's attention,'' said
Susan Grimes Munsell, a Republican, campaigning in Michigan's 8th
District with $44,000, compared with the $758,000 of the Democratic
incumbent, Debbie Stabenow. ``I have to earn votes one at a time,''
Ms. Munsell said. ``My opponent has a staff doing her scheduling
and driving for her. These are advantages money can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   New York is a hotbed of lopsided races, especially ones with
unopposed incumbents with six-digit treasuries. This includes 11 of
New York's 18 House Democratic incumbents and four of the 13
Republicans. Among the Democrats are Gary Ackerman ($581,000
raised), Edolphus Towns ($592,500), Jerrold Nadler ($421,200),
Nydia Velazquez ($329,400) and Charles Rangel ($996,500).
Republicans include Sherwood Boehlert ($440,000), Rick Lazio ($1.3
million) and Peter King ($378,000).
</P>
<P>
   In western Pennsylvania, the English-Klemens race demonstrates
how a financial mismatch can affect a campaign. Klemens has never
run for office and is seeking to become a ``citizen legislator,''
he said, while English honed his campaign skills beating a strong
Democratic opponent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big advantages is that Phil English has been
through this before and we are on track to raise a lot of money,''
said Robert Holste, English's chief of staff. ``As an incumbent,
you've built a large file of people who will donate. You've got
systems in place. A campaign is like a small business with a
payroll, computers and a Web page. Having those gives us an
advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposite is true for Klemens. ``If you don't have money, you
don't get money,'' said Klemens, who is using a vacation week from
school to campaign. ``It's not only the national party committee,
but from all standpoints. Money begets money and it's difficult to
break that chain. That's how the game is played. The first question
people ask me these days is not about my views, but how much money
I have.''
</P>
<P>
   Incumbents have always had advantages: name recognition, power
of the office, the aura of being a winner, a track record to run on
and all the perks of pork-barrel politics.
</P>
<P>
   But all that is heightened in this year's unusually
uncompetitive House contests. For starters, there are only 33 of
the so-called open seats _ where candidates run on relatively equal
footing. There were 51 in 1996, 52 in 1994 and 84 in 1992. In races
involving an incumbent, only about 40 challengers are considered to
have a real chance.
</P>
<P>
   While the competition is shrinking, however, corporate political
donations have been steadily growing. One truism about business
money is that it is pragmatic and not political. Corporate money
goes to buy access in Washington and corporations want to back
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are fewer House elections with any real action this
year,'' said Thomas Mann, a congressional expert at the Brookings
Institution. ``The parties have written off more seats and haven't
helped the challengers who are the real long shots. Business
political action committees play it safe. They go with the
incumbents because they want to maintain access.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Political action committees give overwhelmingly to incumbents.
In this election cycle, they have raised $149 million for House and
Senate races, and have given 84 percent, or $125 million, to
incumbents, the Center for Responsible Politics said. In 1996, 65
percent of PAC money went to incumbents; in 1994, 71 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we don't have a Democratic or a Republican Party, we
have an incumbency party,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of
Democracy 21, a nonprofit group lobbying for campaign finance
reform. ``If you are an incumbent, whether a Democrat or a
Republican, you will get the bulk of the money in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the political parties themselves, which make direct
donations to individual House candidates, are cutting back in
supporting long-shot challengers. This is especially true of the
Democrats, whose congressional campaign committee has raised $13.2
million so far to help House candidates. The Republican counterpart
has raised $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are telling challengers that to beat an incumbent you have
to be very well-funded,'' said Daniel Sallick, a spokesman for the
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. ``Fund-raising success
feeds fund-raising success. Strong challengers attract money when
there's a sense they have a real shot at winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Another high Democratic Party fund-raising official added: ``We
don't want to give money to tilt at windmills or buy landslides.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, more flush with cash, are giving lavishly to their
House candidates. The Republican Congressional Committee is
providing 90 House candidates with up to $70,000 in direct
donations and is sponsoring a $25 million television advertising
blitz for House candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Republicans are the incumbent party. And, according
to Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the National Republican
Congressional Committee, ``We want to take maximum advantage of the
current situation.''

YANKEES PREPARE FOR DEPARTURES AND REPLACEMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BBO-NOTEBOOK and BBO-METS-YANKS) 
(mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees' victory parade ended and
another parade immediately began _ the parade of superstars
supposedly linked to the Yankees' future, from Barry Bonds to Roger
Clemens to Albert Belle to Randy Johnson to Kevin Brown.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the Yankees will land a big name. The principal
owner, George Steinbrenner, may not be willing to give Bernie
Williams as much as the Mets gave Mike Piazza, but maybe he will
give big dollars to Belle or Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But assuming that Williams signs elsewhere and that David Cone
cannot reach a settlement that will keep him with the team, these
names make sense for the Yankees: Todd Stottlemyre for the rotation
and Rondell White for center field.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner is in Florida this weekend and had plans to see
Williams play guitar, part of the owner's effort to smooth over his
relationship with the center fielder. But Williams is deeply bitter
about the way the Yankees handled past negotiations, and does not
appear interested in giving them a discount.
</P>
<P>
   He wants big money, and Williams figures to land a seven-year
deal from somebody _ maybe Boston, perhaps Colorado or Texas _ for
$12 million to $15 million a year. Unless Steinbrenner wakes up one
day feeling unusually generous, the Yankees' offer might be about
30 percent to 40 percent less. Many in the Yankee organization have
assumed all year that Williams will leave.
</P>
<P>
   Cone and his agent were expected to meet with Steinbrenner and
general manager Brian Cashman in Florida Saturday. Cone has a $5.5
million option for 1999, but coming off a 20-victory season, he
wants more and could get more elsewhere, from Baltimore or Los
Angeles. The Yankees, who know better than anyone what Cone's
physical condition is, may not want to give him more if they
believe he won't remain healthy. If they can't find middle ground,
they will move on.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner will sit down Monday with his advisers and discuss
the best ways to replace Williams and Cone. With the players they
have in hand, the Yankees have committed about $57 million to next
year's team; it figures that at some point, they will reach a
multiyear agreement with third-baseman Scott Brosius for around $5
million a season.
</P>
<P>
   To sign Belle, a left fielder, the Yankees would have to offer
perhaps $12 million a season _ and while they would get a big
right-handed bat for the middle of their lineup, they still
wouldn't have a true center fielder. (Ricky Ledee would shift from
left to center.)
</P>
<P>
   Brown wants a six-year deal, and could get $11 million to $12
million a year, so he's not really a viable option. Johnson is a
dominating pitcher and could command a four- or five-year deal, but
he is 35 and has demonstrated great petulance, sulking through the
first half of last season when he wasn't happy; do you want him to
be your highest-paid player? Clemens, the likely American League Cy
Young award winner, would be terrific, and he has the contractual
ability to force Toronto into trading him. But the Blue Jays, a
division rival, would presumably insist on a staggering package of
prospects in return for Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   If Cone and Williams leave, the Yankees will need solid,
relatively affordable players who fit their needs _ Stottlemyre and
White.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees don't need an ace; they need another experienced
starter to add to David Wells, Orlando Hernandez, Andy Pettitte,
Hideki Irabu and Ramiro Mendoza. Stottlemyre is a free agent coming
off a year in which he went 14-13 with a 3.74 earned run average
for the St. Louis Cardinals and Texas Rangers. He is 33, the son of
the Yankees' pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre, and extraordinarily
competitive, and he will cost perhaps 30 percent to 40 percent less
than Brown or Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   White, a right-handed hitter, has two years remaining on a
moderately priced five-year contract _ $3 million for 1999, $4
million for 2000 and a $4 million option for 2001 _ and is a rising
star who hit .300 with 17 homers and 16 stolen bases before a July
finger injury ended his '98 season. He, too, is regarded as a
serious competitor. White is, in many ways, like Williams _ but
three years younger, and already under contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos are rebuilding again and would be willing to move
White. They need a third-baseman; the Yankees could offer the
prospect Mike Lowell, who will be expendable if Brosius re-signs.
The Expos need a pitcher; the Yankees could offer Ryan Bradley or
Mendoza. The teams have a history of dealing together. (Remember
John Wetteland?) Assume they will talk, once the parade of
superstars passes.

CANDIDATES FOR GOVERNOR MAKE LAST MINUTE PITCHES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Proven economic results vs. new energy and ideas.
</P>
<P>
   That was the political choice being offered voters Saturday, as
Acting Governor Paul Cellucci took to the rails for whistle-stop
pep rallies, while Democratic nominee Scott Harshbarger practiced
retail politics at football games in Democratic strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   With the clock running down and many voters undecided, according
to polls, both men spent the day trying to point out differences in
their positions and philosophies and convince would-be voters that
there is a real choice in the race for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci's old-fashioned campaign by train, though, had the feel
of a victory lap, as about 200 supporters accompanied him and his
running mate, Jane Swift, to pep rallies in Haverhill, Lawrence,
Reading, and Melrose.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger, by contrast, played the role of the scrappy
underdog, peppering his speeches with stinging criticisms of the
acting governor as he made the rounds of football games in
Somerville, Cambridge, and Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul Cellucci and his administration have been plagued with
ethical questions, illegal fund-raising, and special interest deals
for eight years,'' Harshbarger said during a news conference at his
Boston headquarters. ``It is time to clean house.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci largely ignored his rival, focusing as he has all year
on the state's strong economy and his own written promise not to
raise taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really do believe Jane and I are best equipped to lead this
state for the next four years,'' he told cheering crowd. ``We have
the agenda and we have the record to keep Massachusetts moving
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   In a subtle dig, though, Cellucci said he hoped to build on the
progress he has made. ``Don't risk turning the clock back,'' he
warned, a reference to the high taxes of the late 1980s under a
Democratic governor.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also reminded his supporters that Massachusetts is a
much different place than it was in 1991, when it had the highest
unemployment rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people were out of work and worried about what their
future would be. We have restored the fiscal and economic health of
Massachusetts. We have put 425,000 people back to work,'' he
crowed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opponent in this race I don't think understands those
economic issues,'' Cellucci said, pointing to Harshbarger's refusal
to sign a no-new-taxes pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Over at Russell Field in Cambridge, Harshbarger watched the
Rindge and Latin football team run up a lead over the Malden
Tornadoes. Harshbarger, a former Harvard College halfback, said the
day gave him a chance to combine twin passions: sports and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   His message in the closing days, Harshbarger said, is that
voters have a real choice. ``If you care about investing in our
kids, investing in education, economic security, we can do
better,'' Harshbarger said. ``And that's what my candidacy
offers.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Harshbarger saw a metaphor in the Rindge and Latin
Falcons, on their way to a 33-0 win. In past years, they had sunk
into mediocrity, he said. Then Cambridge decided to ``invest in''
(read: fund) Pop Warner football and youth leagues. Now, the
public-school team is much improved, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kind of programs make a huge difference,'' Harshbarger
said. ``It keeps them involved, it gives them discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Malden gained a chunk of ground. ``Oh-oh, what's
the defensive coordinator do on that one?'' Harshbarger joked,
watching as his son _ the defensive coordinator _ gestured to his
players. ``Keep an eye on the fake when the end goes down,'' father
yelled to son.
</P>
<P>
   By day's end, the Democrat was off the gridiron and back on the
attack, trying to gain some ground with a Boston Herald story
alleging that the US Army has begun a criminal investigation into
whether Adjutant General Raymond Vezina, commander of the
Massachusetts National Guard, did illegal fund-raising on
Cellucci's behalf and abused his post in other ways.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, an investigation by the state's Office of
Campaign and Political Finance concluded that Vezina had made no
solicitations and had not personally collected contributions for
Cellucci.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Harshbarger and lieutenant governor nominee Warren Tolman
called on the acting governor to suspend Vezina until the new
investigation is complete. The allegations this time, they said,
were more extensive and serious than those addressed in the state
probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that the governor would take swift action on
this,'' Harshbarger said. ``It certainly raises questions of the
appearance of impropriety, and now you have the United States
military conducting ... this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said he had already suspended Vezina for 30 days in the
aftermath of the state probe. He is confident that the Army will
come to the same conclusion as the previous investigation and find
that Vezina did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For Cellucci, Saturday's whistle-stop tour was not just about
delivering his campaign message. It was also about thanking
supporters and urging people to vote. The train, plastered with
Cellucci-Swift signs on the outside, was a moveable party, replete
with gentlemen in red and white stripes playing ``Ragtime Rowdies''
music from car to car, a Santa Claus, and bag lunches.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about rallying the troops,'' Cellucci said, as he
walked through the four-car train, shaking hands with the people
who came along for the ride to cheer him on and carry his signs.
</P>
<P>
   During each stop, to every crowd, both Cellucci and Swift
expressed their appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank all of you who held signs early in the
morning, late at night, made the phone calls, put the bumper
stickers on _ you are the ones who are making the difference,''
Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Swift reminded supporters not to take the election for granted.
``Make sure you vote,'' she said. ``Make sure your friends and
family vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci and Swift will take a bus tour today, visiting
southeastern Massachusetts. Tomorrow, New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani
will campaign for Cellucci. And on Tuesday, Cellucci and Swift will
visit the polls to shake hands with the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger will visit churches in Dorchester, Jamaica Plain and
Roxbury today, before joining Senator John F. Kerry in Springfield,
US Representative Barney Frank in New Bedford, and Senator Edward
M. Kennedy in Hyannis.

ANGLING FOR A RAISE, NEW YORK LAWMAKERS TIPTOE AROUND PATAKI 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (jw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Ah, fall in New York, when the leaves turn, the
apples ripen and legislators' thoughts turn to a pay raise. Not
that anyone will say so openly, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Senate and Assembly members have plenty of distractions these
days, what with running for re-election and watching the races for
governor, U.S. senator, comptroller and attorney general. Yet the
subject that keeps cropping up in conversations with legislators is
a pay raise, albeit on background, off the record and every other
way that won't have anyone's name attached.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, it seems, the love that dare not speak its name is
the lust for a larger paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a subject that people ought to be able to talk
about intelligently, that isn't taboo,'' said Assemblyman Richard
Brodsky, a Westchester County Democrat. ``Instead, it's like
talking about sex in 1954.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers fear that talk of higher salaries will anger voters.
They also worry that being too aggressive on the issue will anger
Gov. George Pataki, who has quashed proposed raises in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators earn a base salary of $57,500 a year, plus stipends
handed out by the leaders of the two houses that raise the average
to more than $66,000. The salaries of the state's elected officials
and department heads have not changed since 1988. For several
years, legislators have quietly clamored for an increase, a call
that gains greater urgency every two years, just after they have
stood for re-election and will not have to face voters for another
two years.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue is of more than mere pecuniary interest. A raise
is often held out, by both legislators and aides to the governor,
as possible trade bait. In other words, the Legislature might be
willing to give Pataki something it had resisted in the past, in
return for his approval of higher salaries. The most frequently
mentioned candidate is charter schools, specialized schools that
operate outside the usual constraints and hierarchy of a school
district.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Democrats in the Legislature contend that some of their
colleagues are refraining from public attacks on Pataki and from
ardent campaigning for his Democratic opponent, Peter Vallone, for
fear that the governor will retaliate after the election by
quashing a raise once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spineless factor here is very high, and no one wants to be
tagged as the guy who got a pay raise killed by sticking it to the
governor,'' said one Democratic Assembly member from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   And what has that member said publicly about Pataki lately, or
done for Vallone? ``Umm,'' he said, ``give me a minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The salary issue rests in Pataki's hands, and although he has
said repeatedly that he sees no need for a raise, he has not ruled
one out, either.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of actual negotiations on the subject, that has
left legislators parsing his public statements with the care once
given to Kremlin missives, finding subtle clues that may or may not
be products of their imaginations.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, when asked about a raise, the governor told The Daily
News, ``I would not support it.'' But legislators were quick to
note that he did not use the word ``veto,'' and speculated that he
might allow a bill to become law without his signature. Of course,
the people making such guesses had never discussed the subject with
Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   A pay-raise bill would also increase salaries for the governor
and the lieutenant governor, the comptroller, the attorney general
and department heads. Salaries for aides to the governor are set
separately and have seen regular increases, with many of them
topping $100,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Though he opposes a pay increase, Pataki has said he cannot
support his family on his $130,000 state salary, and that this is
why he gives speeches at a fee of $17,000 each. Lt. Gov. Betsy
McCaughey Ross, Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Attorney General
Dennis Vacco are paid $110,000 each.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Assembly Democrats say that Speaker Sheldon Silver has been
particularly cautious not to offend the governor while the issue is
hanging over his head. Silver has refused recent requests to talk
to reporters about the governor's record, and his office did not
return calls on the subject of a raise.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, legislators in both parties accused Silver of
fumbling a chance at a pay increase in a squabble with Pataki over
unrelated matters. And they say that if Silver is blamed for losing
it again, his hold on the leadership will be undermined.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors add to the pressure on Silver to deliver a raise.
Most of the Assembly Democrats are from New York City, where the
cost of living is highest, and because of the vagaries of the
stipend system, Assembly Democrats are the lowest-paid legislators,
on average. And a serious case of paycheck envy took hold last
year, when the salaries of California's state legislators, already
the highest in the nation, jumped to $99,000.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are also lobbying for a raise _ though perhaps not
with the same energy as the Democrats _ and they, too, are afraid
to say so. Last year, Joseph Bruno, the Senate majority leader,
disavowed authorship of a proposal to tie salaries to the cost of
living, producing annual increases. When asked whose idea it was,
if not his, Bruno, 69, said: ``I can't recollect. I'm getting early
senility.''
</P>
<P>
   For many Democrats, the matter of stipends, doled out for
leadership positions and committee chairmanships, adds to their
discontent over their earnings. All 61 senators, Republican and
Democrat, and all 53 Republicans in the Assembly receive stipends,
but there are not enough to go around for all 97 Assembly
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   So of the 211 legislators, 33 earn the $57,500 base salary and
no more. All 33 are Democrats in the Assembly, and most are from
New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Under state law, a Legislature cannot raise its pay during its
two-year term. So any increase approved this year would take effect
on Jan. 1, the first day of the next term. If that window is
missed, there will not be a raise until 2001, at the earliest.

WHERE JUSTICE IS SERVED WITH MERCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. _ One night a week, Justice Michael
McElroy, in long black robes, takes the bench in Village Justice
Court here and renders judgment on a parade of suburban offenders,
many of them neighbors and friends.
</P>
<P>
   He metes out punishments for acts like shoving a fellow commuter
on the Metro-North railroad, walking off with a gym bag with a
child's bite plate inside and urinating on the stoop of the local
dry cleaners (a violation known in the village code as ``deposit of
offensive matter'').
</P>
<P>
   His docket commonly includes landlord-tenant disagreements,
disputed traffic tickets and violations of village ordinances. But
last spring, in the first slaying here in two decades, McElroy
presided over the initial court appearance of a man charged with
killing his girlfriend in their riverfront apartment.
</P>
<P>
   As the lowest-level trial court in the state, village courts
pass felony cases on to the state Supreme Court for trial. But
McElroy's jurisdiction is broad. ``This is the people's court, if
there is such a thing as a people's court,'' he said. ``We have
immediate involvement in the lives of a heck of a lot of people,
many of whom we know.''
</P>
<P>
   When intimacy interferes with justice, McElroy, a corporate
lawyer who has served in his elected post for 15 years, recuses
himself and another jurist fills in. That happened last week in the
case of a man accused of harassment for kicking his 17-year-old
son.
</P>
<P>
   The boy is a friend of McElroy's youngest daughter and the
justice has heard many accounts of violence in the defendant's
home. He hopes that the case will end with the man agreeing to
counseling instead of spending 15 days in jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is social work, almost,'' he said as the alternate judge
and the police officer who made the arrest met in chambers with the
father, a pale, slightly built man in a sagging cardigan sweater.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of McElroy's cases are traffic violations,
which he handles with the mercy of a man who commutes 112 miles
each day to Suffolk County. A woman has been caught driving 51
miles per hour in a 30-mph zone. But she was late for her duties as
a Girl Scout leader, she explains. McElroy lets her plead to 39
mph, thus lowering her fine and the points on her license.
</P>
<P>
   His understanding of village matters informs his judgment,
particularly when it comes to parking tickets issued at the
railroad station, a frequent indignity in the suburbs, where
two-career families compete for an inadequate number of spaces.
</P>
<P>
   So last week, McElroy dismissed the case of a woman who parked
illegally in a permit-only spot because the metered lot was full,
leaving four quarters on her windshield in a gesture of good faith.
McElroy told her that the next summons would yield a fine, then
begged her to join a community letter-writing effort to protest the
lack of parking.
</P>
<P>
   The last case of the evening was a dispute between neighbors of
nearly 20 years. Their houses face each other on Overlook Road,
with vistas of the Hudson River and the last blaze of autumn
foliage.
</P>
<P>
   In June, one man parked his car at the curb beneath an oak tree
on the other's property. A tree limb, 17 feet long, fell on the car
with crushing results. Insurance paid for the damage, except for
the $500 deductible.
</P>
<P>
   That $500 was the subject of a lawsuit that reached trial before
McElroy. Each man testified, sniping insults at the other.
Photographs were offered in evidence, along with bills from a tree
service. Was the tree limb dead at the time it fell? Had its owner
been negligent? Was the weather stormy, or merely overcast?
</P>
<P>
   McElroy determined that the plaintiff had not proved his case,
offering him sympathy but no cash judgment. He urged the men to
mend their broken friendship, since amity is essential to
small-town life. He persuaded them to shake hands, which they did
grudgingly, eyes averted and hands limp.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiff said he had never expected to win. ``What I really
wanted was just an `I'm sorry,''' he grumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're entitled to that,'' McElroy said. ``But it's
not in the jurisdiction of this court.''

KEY RACES TIGHTEN AS CAMPAIGN ENTERS FINAL DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republicans and Democrats are heading toward
Tuesday's midterm election with a furious round of television
advertising, as new polls show several key races tightening in the
final days of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The election is likely to come down to two trends: First, nearly
all House incumbents and all but a few Senate incumbents are likely
to win reelection. Second, swings in a few dozen tight races, many
receiving a last-minute infusion of Republican advertising money,
will determine the nation's political course and possibly affect
whether President Clinton is impeached.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Republicans are hopeful of strengthening their
grip on the nation's governorships, and gaining a majority of the
state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   For Congress, leaders in both parties agree that Republicans
were doing well in late summer, but the campaign started moving in
the Democrats' favor in late September and October. The question is
whether one party will surge ahead as Republicans in the final week
pour $10 million into 68 key races in an effort to revive the issue
of the Clinton sex scandal. Democrats are hoping that a backlash
against the ads will help their party.
</P>
<P>
   Polls conducted last week found that Democrats slightly edged
Republicans in a ``generic'' vote for Congress. While leading
political analysts predict Republicans may pick up one to three
seats in the Senate and fewer than 10 in the House, that is half
the gain some experts were predicting in August after Clinton
admitted he had an inappropriate relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 34 Senate seats up for election, about a half-dozen are
so close they are within the margin of error of local polls,
according to a survey by The Hotline newsletter. For example, in
North Carolina last week, Republican Senator Lauch Faircloth was
leading Democrat John Edwards by 44 percent to 43 percent. New
York's Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who had been dropping
behind Representative Charles Schumer most of last week, climbed
back to a tie at 47 percent in one poll. In Wisconsin, Republican
Representative Mark Neumann was leading Senator Russell Feingold 46
percent to 43 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While some political specialists already are analyzing the
election with phrases like ``status quo'' and ``mixed message,''
they cautioned that midterm elections are notoriously
unpredictable, and voter turnout will be the key. Both parties have
raised record amounts of money, especially the unlimited and
unregulated ``soft money'' used for issue ads that can turn around
races in the final days.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP clearly has the financial edge, with the three main
Republican national committees outraising their Democratic
counterparts by 73 percent in the period between Jan. 1 1997 and
Oct. 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many analysts agreed with Larry Makinson of the Center
for Responsive Politics, who said last week that the reelection
rate ``will be like the human body temperature, above 98'' percent.
Thus, both parties focused on tight House races in states such as
Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Indiana, Kentucky, Idaho, and Washington,
as well as a handful of hotly contested Senate campaigns in North
and South Carolina, New York, Kentucky, and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a guide of what to watch Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; US Senate.  &LR; Republicans, who control the Senate 55-45, dream of
capturing at least five seats to give them a ``filibuster-proof''
majority, meaning that if 60 Republicans vote together, they would
prevent Democrats from killing bills by filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   Several Democratic incumbents are fighting for their political
lives, including Senators Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina, Patty Murray of Washington, Barbara
Boxer of California, and Russell Feingold of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Moseley-Braun has been considered the most vulnerable of
Democratic senator, but in a poll released Saturday surged to a
slim lead over her opponent, state Senator Peter
Fitzgerald. &UR;  &LR; Boxer's lead over state Treasurer Matt Fong, which had
been widening most of last week, shrank to two points in a new
poll. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  While the D'Amato and Boxer races have received much national
attention, many experts are watching the Kentucky race for the seat
being vacated by Democratic Senator Wendell Ford. Earlier this
year, the seat was expected to go to a Republican. But Republican
Representative Jim Bunning, a member of baseball's Hall of Fame, is
facing a stiff challenge from Democratic Representative Scotty
Baesler, a former basketball star. Both parties are pouring tens of
thousands of dollars of soft money into the state to pay for
``issue ads'' designed to denigrate the opposing candidate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; US House.  &LR; By historic standards, Republicans should do well in
a midterm election when Democrats control the White House, with
precedent indicating the GOP could pick up around 35 House seats.
But such a large win is unlikely this year because Republicans made
major gains in 1994, when the GOP picked up 52 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Walter, who analyzes House races for the Cook Political
Report, predicted Republicans would pick up five to seven seats.
With 402 of 435 House members running for reelection, nearly all
are likely to be reelected.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you wake up on Nov. 4, you won't see all that much
change, not like in '94,'' Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans control the House 228-206, and one seat is held by
an Independent. Todd Harris, a spokesman for the National
Republican Campaign Committee, said the party is aiming to push
Democrats to fewer than 200 seats. ``That would be psychologically
demoralizing for Democrats,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Governors.  &LR; For the past decade, Republicans have been gobbling
up governorships. Currently, the governorships are held by 32
Republicans, 17 Democrats, and 1 Independent. Republicans hold 24
of 36 seats up for election, and analysts predict the GOP could
pick up a few more.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans view their best chances in Maryland, where
Democratic Governor Parris Glendening faces Republican Ellen
Sauerbrey; Florida, where Republican Jeb Bush leads Democratic
Lieutenant Governor Buddy MacKay; and Georgia, where Democratic
state Representative Roy Barnes faces Republican businessman Guy
Millner.
</P>
<P>
   But a good Republican showing would be overshadowed if the big
prize of California slips away. Democratic Lieutenant Governor Gray
Davis leads state Attorney General Dan Lungren as the campaign
heads into the final days.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; State &LR;   &UR; Houses.  &LR; Republicans hope to gain control of a majority
of state legislatures. Currently, Democrats control 49 legislative
chambers, Republicans control 48, and one chamber is tied in
Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Republican National Committee spokesman Tim Fitzpatrick, perhaps
anticipating less-than-dramatic GOP gains in Congress, said: ``The
real story out there is our gains in the state and local level.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Referendums.  &LR; An array of referendums are on state ballots,
including an Oregon initiative to ban clear-cutting of forests, a
California initiative on Indian gambling operations, a
Massachusetts referendum on public campaign financing, and an
initiative in six states and the District of Columbia on the
controlled medical use of marijuana.

REAL ESTATE: A BUILDER EMBARKS ON A NEW DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Fla., N.J., Pa., Texas, Va.)  (js) 
 By DAVID J. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTINGDON VALLEY, Pa. _ After devoting 30 years to building
upscale homes, Toll Brothers, based in this Philadelphia suburb,
has formed a real estate investment trust to build and manage
apartments, offices and stores in and near its communities.
</P>
<P>
   The REIT _ Toll Brothers Realty Trust _ broke ground last April
on its first venture, Dulles Greene, an 800-apartment complex on a
55-acre site in the Washington suburb of Herndon, Va., in Fairfax
County. In adjacent Loudoun County, it has embarked on another
venture, a planned community on a 1,045-acre site called Belmont
Country Club, which is expected to include 1.8 million square feet
of office space, 200,000 square feet of retail space and 1,900
residential units, as well as a private golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nasty part of the home building business is that when you
sell the house, you're done,'' said Robert Toll, chief executive
officer at Toll Brothers. ``We've wound up with a lot of ground for
apartment and office projects. There are several million square
feet of space to build. And some of these related businesses are in
lockstep with the development, so we've gotten into the security
and landscaping businesses. We can put in landscaping and charge
less than a contractor.''
</P>
<P>
   Toll Brothers, which posted sales of $971 million last year in
16 states, created its REIT by turning over to it the ownership of
developable land it has acquired over several years. Instead of
selling off some of the land not zoned for homes, as has been
customary, Toll has chosen to develop all of his land and capture
fees for development services and rental income from retail and
office projects.
</P>
<P>
   As a REIT, the commercial venture can avoid corporate taxes as
long as 95 percent of the trust's earnings are distributed to
shareholders as dividends. Large-scale development can then be
financed by shareholders instead of banks or insurance companies.
The shares are usually, but not necessarily, offered to the public.
A REIT has great flexibility in executing its business plan, said
Gerard Sweeney, president of Brandywine Realty Trust, a REIT based
in Newtown Square, Pa., that owns about 18 million square feet of
office and industrial properties in the mid-Atlantic region.
</P>
<P>
   Many publicly held development companies consider this form of
financing more secure than the institutional financing they were
receiving a decade ago, Sweeney said. At that time, many banks were
unable to sustain projects they had financed, undermining
development ventures in their early stages, he said. On the other
hand, when share prices are weak, REIT's may find the door to
capital closed and continued growth difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Toll Brothers is not alone among publicly held development
companies that have diversified to find income from new sources.
Some have gone overseas seeking new customers or into new
businesses at home. Most new ventures support the core
home-building operation _ landscaping for new homes, pest control
services, home-security installation. Then there are subsidiaries
or related companies to provide financial or insurance services,
such as mortgage lending, mortgage insurance and home equity loans.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall Lennar Corp., of Miami, spun off its real
estate-investment business and combined its mortgage-underwriting
and building operations with Pacific Greystone, a California
builder. That merger catapulted Lennar into the California markets,
beyond its traditional bases in Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Centex Homes, based in Dallas, entered the manufactured-housing
industry in 1997 to serve its own projects and supply other
builders. It also owns Texas Trust Savings Bank and Centex Mortgage
Co., among the country's largest originators of mortgages for
new-home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Some builders have their own security, landscaping or
extermination staffs. Others, such as Pulte Corp., contract with
service providers, preferring to rely on existing companies from
which they can gain volume discounts, said James Zeumer, vice
president for investor and corporate relations at Pulte, the
nation's largest home builder with $2.54 billion in overall revenue
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home builders are looking at how to leverage the relationship
with the consumer and to develop other revenue streams that are
less cyclical,'' said Zeumer. Pulte's income from home loans to
buyers represented only 5 percent of its revenue last year, Zeumer
said, although it is growing internationally with loans to buyers
in Mexico and Puerto Rico.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Toll Brothers Realty Trust is currently a nonpublic
investment vehicle in which Toll Brothers expects to hold a 40
percent stake, with a pension fund taking the rest. The trust's
initial capitalization provided money to pursue construction on
existing land, plus acquisition of other sites and buildings. Toll
said he hoped to offer shares to the public within five years,
after the portfolio reaches the scale of ``a few hundred million
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Directing the trust is Kevin McAndrews, who previously worked
for Trammell Crow, the Dallas-based development company, and later
formed McAndrews Realty Advisers, a consulting firm for developers
in the Washington metropolitan area. Both the Dulles Greene and
Belmont Country Club sites were purchased by Toll Brothers Realty
Trust from a bank that had foreclosed on a previous developer, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dulles Greene is a gated rental community with tennis courts, a
business center and pool. It is on Innovation Avenue at Route 28 in
Herndon, three minutes from the Washington-Dulles International
Airport. The first residents in the 390-unit first phase of the
development, which consists of garden apartments or town-house
rentals on 22 acres, are scheduled to move in this weekend, , said
Webb Koschene, vice president of Toll Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont Country Club is on Route 7 near Leesburg, Va., on land
once owned by the Lee family, which included two signers of the
Declaration of Independence. The 1790 manor house is being restored
as part of the golf course clubhouse. The first houses to rise on
the site will be built and sold by Toll Brothers, not the trust,
McAndrews said.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, McAndrews said, the trust may pursue projects
independently of Toll Brothers. ``The REIT has the flexibility to
acquire existing properties or land on which to build,'' he said.
``We're focusing on markets where we already know the area.'' In
the residential business, the two companies may work together or in
partnership with other builders, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate investment trusts are just one factor in the
re-emergence of large-scale development nationwide. The home
construction boom of recent years, the lowest borrowing costs for
builders in a decade and the growth of networked nationwide
computer systems have all helped large builders grow geographically
and economically, said Gopal Aluwalia, director of research at the
National Association of Home Builders in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of cyclicality in the industry has been reduced,''
he said. ``In previous years, if a homebuilder faced a slowdown
they would shift to light commercial work or remodeling and
renovation. But builders are looking to enter new markets and find
different sources of revenue.''

MAIN STREET BANKERS ARE ADEPT WITH BOTH NUMBERS AND PEOPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A recent story about a 74-year-old Kansas
City area banker coming out of retirement to resume his career was
the other side _ the less-told side _ of America's banking
industry.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Main Street side of the story. It has nothing to do
with the Wall Street side, where hedge fund rocket scientists make
headlines by losing millions of dollars trading financial
artifacts. The ``derivatives'' do little to build communities or
enhance overall prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   When Frank M. Pruett explained his desire to get back into
harness, he said it came down to banking being ``a people business,
and I love people.''
</P>
<P>
   Some may have figured Pruett was making nice because it was good
public relations. Anyone who has had much to do with old-fashioned
bankers, however, knew it was more likely an explanation that came
from the heart. The success of Main Street bankers is in direct
proportion to their people skills.
</P>
<P>
   The good ones have financial acumen, management expertise and
shrewd deal-making skills. The great ones also are gifted with
outgoing personalities that can't be faked. If they don't have an
instinctive affection for people, their potential as bankers is
forever limited.
</P>
<P>
   It's the love of people that not only makes these Main Street
bankers good at selling their services and themselves, but also
makes them effective community leaders.
</P>
<P>
   One of the joys of being a business journalist is the occasional
opportunity to get together for a bull session with old-line
bankers. The exceptional ones are street savvy, well versed in the
peculiarities of the local marketplace and more knowledgeable about
their communities than anyone else in town.
</P>
<P>
   Their local knowledge is their greatest strength, because this
is what made them successful lenders long before computers came
along to rigidly quantify who is creditworthy and who isn't. The
three C's of lending are capacity (to repay), collateral and
character. Judging that third C is always what separated the
superior local bankers from the average players. Sometimes a banker
who's a shrewd judge of character can boost a community's economy
by making loans they know will be good even if the numbers look
iffy.
</P>
<P>
   For many bankers, there's no greater joy than making a good
judgment call based on an accurate reading of a borrower's
character. It gets into the blood, and this is no doubt why older
bankers such as Pruett would rather work than retire.
</P>
<P>
   There are essentially two kinds of hard-core bankers. There are
those who own banks and those who want to own banks. Many of the
latter are retired or close to it, with substantial nest eggs to
invest.
</P>
<P>
   This probably helps explain why small bank start-ups have
exploded in the last several years as a countertrend to the mergers
of the industry giants. Just as there are lots of bankers who like
the personal touch of Main Street banking, there are also lots of
prospective customers who prefer the intimate nature of smaller
community banks.
</P>
<P>
   As the consolidation of large banks has continued apace in the
'90s, concern has grown about excessive concentrations of banking
power in America. Although this is a legitimate concern, the
resurgence of small start-up banks should prove an ameliorating
factor.
</P>
<P>
   In America, it seems, there will always be a competitive place
for those who take the traditional view of banking as a ``people
business.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ wouldn't be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the SEC battle, Stowers repeatedly pointed to his
funds' success using the computer program. And repeatedly, he said,
the agency dismissed the connection. The funds enjoyed ``fortuitous
circumstances,'' the agency told him.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Kuraner what that meant. The funds had been lucky, the
attorney told him.
</P>
<P>
   The investment world, however, was more impressed with Stowers'
success. In April 1981, Money magazine put him on its cover and the
ball was rolling.
</P>
<P>
   By 1983, Twentieth Century had grown to the $1 billion mark
Stowers' old friends at Waddell &AMP; Reed had pointed to. The funds
grew to $5 billion by the October 1987 stock market crash.
</P>
<P>
   Then, lightning struck. Twentieth Century's Ultra Fund, started
in November 1981, doubled investors' money between October 1990 and
October 1991. The achievement and publicity set off a tidal wave of
new accounts. Every employee in the company, including Stowers,
took new-investors' calls.
</P>
<P>
   And the bigger the funds got, the more fees Stowers' companies
earned. His wealth grew until, in 1994, Forbes listed his fortune
at $400 million, No. 299 on its list of the 400 richest Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers had done better for himself than the better-known Henry
Bloch, who was lower on the list.
</P>
<P>
   The Stowers fortune has doubled since then.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the New York banking firm J.P. Morgan agreed to pay
$900 million for 45 percent of American Century. The deal left
Stowers in control of the company and a fortune the magazine now
puts at nearly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A large part of the shares J.P. Morgan acquired came from the
Stowers Institute for Medical Research. Jim and Virginia Stowers
had formed the institute in 1994, giving it what amounted to $50
million worth of shares in the mutual fund company.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the sale, the shares raised $300 million for the
institute. The couple's gift pushed them into the upper echelon of
American philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   The American Benefactor magazine recently listed the Stowerses
as the seventh most generous Americans. The ranking, the magazine's
second annual list, was based on lifetime totals of giving. The
magazine didn't count unpaid pledges. Ted Turner, for example, has
promised $1 billion to the United Nations, but the magazine credits
only $22 million that it said had changed hands so far.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does it count gifts to foundations that remain under the
control of the giver. The money has to be given away.
</P>
<P>
   Listed at $325 million, the Stowerses' gift placed them ahead of
the $180 million credited to Rockefeller and nearly triple the $118
million attributed so far to Gates and his wife. Turner's total
stands at $70 million, the magazine's ranking showed.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers had little to say about the ranking in Forbes. He didn't
even know about the recent listing in The American Benefactor.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what?'' was his reaction. ``We're not doing what we're
trying to do to be ballyhooed and to impress the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said he owed his fortune to the millions of people
who made him successful. This is the payback.
</P>
<P>
   Emotion grips Stowers when he talks about his dreams for the
Stowers Institute. His eyes moisten. His voice leaps an octave and
sometimes he'll apologize.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife each have survived cancer. The institute is
intended to give hope, and ultimately cures, to those who face the
same fight.
</P>
<P>
   But in starting this second great venture of his life, Stowers
says he knows how he wants it to turn out. He wants to turn Kansas
City into a global center for medical research. The institute, he
said, would be only a starting point for a grand research community
that he believes he will see in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The fortune he has thrown at the Stowers Institute is to attract
``cutting-edge scientists,'' just as he built his fund company by
attracting the best talent possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to convince the scientists,'' he said. ``If we can
convince them that this is the best thing in the world, they'll
come full time.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Stowerses are gone, the institute will get their
remaining fortune. But Stowers said he didn't expect that to
fulfill his dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need help. My wife and I have set the stage,'' he said.
``But it's going to take millions of other people to do this. We
don't have enough money to do this.''

GRAND VISION ENDURES IN GIFT FROM AMERICAN CENTURY CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Forty years ago, Jim Stowers started selling
a couple of mutual funds out of the basement of a bank building in
Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Now the chairman and principal owner of American Century
Investments is being hailed as one of the richest and most generous
living Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In the annals of Kansas City success stories, he has topped the
riches, if not the name recognition, of H&AMP;R Block founders Henry
and Richard Bloch.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nation's greatest benefactors, Stowers and his wife,
Virginia, are credited with giving away more money than software
magnate Bill Gates, media mogul Ted Turner and banking titan David
Rockefeller.
</P>
<P>
   For Stowers, 74, acclaim came only after decades of quiet
diligence and a few grueling years.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1980, Stowers had just 25 employees and had
attracted only 9,000 investors to his mutual fund firm, then called
Twentieth Century Investors.
</P>
<P>
   He has survived a battle with federal authorities who at one
point had ordered him barred from the business. Survival, however,
quickly turned to success, and finally prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The Stowerses have pledged their fortune to build the Stowers
Institute for Medical Research. Their mission is not only to cure
cancer, but also to turn Kansas City into a world center for
medical research.
</P>
<P>
   It's a grand vision by a man who said he had never dreamed of
the runaway success that followed from that Halloween opening four
decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Stowers' story begins with humble days when he memorized a
sales line at Waddell &AMP; Reed Inc. All the salesmen used it. After
wooing 162 leads, Stowers made a sale.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson was not lost on young Stowers. He quickly dropped the
general sales pitch and tailored his approach to evaluating the
prospect's situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to sell funds, you will fall flat on your face,''
he said recently in his 16th-story office in American Century Tower
I.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers said he got to that tower by working hard, surrounding
himself with the best talent he could find and focusing on what his
customers needed. He sold customers not only Waddell &AMP; Reed's
mutual funds, but also life insurance from other firms. When his
employer told him to stop with the insurance, Stowers set out on
his own in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   He began by selling other mutual funds, but after a year
discovered his company wasn't making any money. He then raised seed
money and started two of his own mutual funds, which survive today
as Twentieth Century Growth and Twentieth Century Select funds.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers didn't chase big clients. He figured they already had
accountants, attorneys and advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that the people who really needed us and wanted us
and we could help the most were the small people,'' Stowers said.
``They didn't have all the experts on their side.''
</P>
<P>
   Stowers believed that if he made enough little guys successful,
they would in time make him successful.
</P>
<P>
   Still, 19 years into it, Stowers' old buddies at Waddell &AMP; Reed
asked why his funds hadn't grown to $1 billion yet. His funds had
only about $50 million in them, and his firm about two dozen
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be patient,'' Stowers said he told doubters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he had spent most of the 1970s battling with the
federal agency that regulates U.S. investment markets.
</P>
<P>
   A defiant mood sweeps over Stowers when the subject comes up. He
is no fan of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't trust them,'' he said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers said that at one point in the 1970s he began to
tape-record his telephone conversations because of concerns about
the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   He no longer records phone calls, though, and Stowers says his
staff assures him the SEC is all right today. But he has not lost
all of the suspicion generated more than 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers said the 1970s started with the SEC trying to discourage
mutual funds from selling stock holdings for fear such sales would
depress the market.
</P>
<P>
   Not long afterward, the SEC told Stowers to stop using a rocket
ship for his funds' logo because it seemed to promise big returns.
The demand irked Stowers, who had been using the logo for more than
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't like the rocket ship, either. But all of a sudden
they didn't like it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was a trifle compared with the charges the SEC brought
against Stowers in 1974. The agency challenged his dealings with a
Chicago stockbroker named Richard Driehaus that the regulators
tried to prove involved a kickback scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Driehaus had been a prime source of stock ideas for Stowers'
mutual funds. While other brokers could produce one good stock lead
among a long list of names they suggested, Driehaus produced six or
seven, Stowers said. The two men, it turned out, were evaluating
stocks in much the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC complaint centered on computer services for Stowers'
firm that the agency said were paid for by Driehaus' brokerage
firm, which also got much of the mutual funds' brokerage business.
Stowers contended that he developed the computer program in
conjunction with Driehaus and tried to recoup his costs by selling
the information to brokerages.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-1976, an SEC judge ordered Stowers barred from the fund
industry. Stowers appealed and succeeded in getting the order
overturned, but the government still censured him. Unsatisfied,
Stowers tried to appeal that, but could not get a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your life's at stake, your livelihood, you fight like
hell,'' Stowers said.
</P>
<P>
   Stowers credits his attorney in the case for saving his
reputation and company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was on the line,'' he said. ``If not for Irving
Kuraner, we wouldn't be here.'' MORE

A CAR ACCIDENT SLOWS VALLONE NEAR THE FINISH
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A car accident did to Peter Vallone what the prospect
of a crushing defeat in the race for governor had not: leave him
subdued and slowed Saturday, as he entered the final weekend of
campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Vallone, still in pain from Friday's crash in Rockaway Beach,
Queens, visited two churches in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn
Saturday, exhorting the mostly Caribbean parishioners to vote on
Tuesday. Until a few hours earlier, his aides had left open the
possibility that Vallone, the speaker of the New York City Council
and Democratic candidate, would be too sore to campaign at all
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, George Pataki, the Republican incumbent who has a
2-to-1 lead over Vallone in polls, traveled upstate, trying to
spread his coattails wide enough to help Sen. Alfonse D'Amato and
Attorney General Dennis Vacco, who are in much tighter races.
Pataki appeared with Vacco in Utica and Rome, and was set to attend
a rally with Vacco and D'Amato later in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday afternoon's accident, Vallone's car was struck from
behind and pushed into another car. He refused treatment at the
scene, but later went to a hospital complaining of neck and back
pain. He was released Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Vallone's famous equanimity has shown signs of
cracking, as he occasionally scolded Pataki for refusing to debate
him, or complained that news organizations were not covering the
race more thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   In the last days of the campaign, Vallone's advertisements have
nearly disappeared from the air waves, as his campaign has all but
run out of money. And the race has appeared to defy the
conventional wisdom that runaway contests inevitably tighten in the
final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, his voice subdued and his step slowed, Vallone wore a
back brace that relaxed the back muscles with electrical
stimulation. A former semi-pro football player, Vallone, 63, said,
``I'm feeling just like I felt a couple of decades ago after a
football game. It's painful but it's fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside Trinity Seventh-day Adventist Church, Vallone urged the
congregation to turn out on Tuesday. ``We must never let this city
or this state or this country be taken away by all the people that
have all the money and all the power,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has long contended that the Democrats are the party of
ordinary people and Republicans the party of the rich. But he might
as well have been contrasting the relative strengths of the popular
governor's campaign, which has raised a record $20 million, and his
own, which has raised about $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki does not plan to accept an invitation from WNBC's Gabe
Pressman for a televised, face-to-face session with the Democratic
candidate on Sunday. Vallone said Saturday that he would be there,
even if it is only to debate an empty chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have more to say to the chair,'' he joked, ``than I've
ever had a chance to say to him.''

<P>
   SILVER SPRING, Md. _ down her house.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican piece says the defense's attempt to blame the
fire on her dead 13-year-old son was ``an eye-opening example of
the cynical win-at-all-cost beliefs of Dennis Moore.''
</P>
<P>
   The camera angle continues to move until Moore is looking
straight ahead. An American flag, lighted ever so carefully from
the bottom, comes into view.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I've defended some people charged with horrible crimes,
and I gave it my all....And that's what I'll do as your congressman
_ give it my all and fight hard every day, to win for you and your
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have been attacking Republicans on Social Security for
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea for a response was hatched only last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security barrage from the Democrats was proving to be
too strong, too all-encompassing. Another Snowbarger ad on taxes,
as one consultant recommended, wouldn't cut it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't listen to the things Dennis Moore was saying
on Social Security anymore,'' said Kevin Yowell, Snowbarger's chief
aide. ``We had to respond to it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Snowbarger met with two businesswomen Oct. 22, Yowell
filled the time quietly jotting down a script.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a senior citizen,'' his ad began, ``I was scared when I
heard Dennis Moore say that Vince Snowbarger wants to get rid of
Social Security. Then I did some research and found out it wasn't
true.''
</P>
<P>
   He envisioned soft lighting and quiet music _ ideas that stick.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, in a telephone conference call between
Snowbarger, his aides, St. Claire and pollster Jim McLaughlin, more
decisions are made. St. Claire has rewritten the script, tossing
out Yowell's first sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The line, St. Claire suggests later, violates a cardinal rule
because it repeats Moore's charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every second we spend reiterating his charge is a second we
can't spend telling the truth,'' St. Claire argues.
</P>
<P>
   Early plans call for finding a senior citizen from the 3rd
District who agrees with Yowell's sentiments. Maybe ask her some
questions on camera in an interview format and let her talk freely
about her fears.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday, though, any plans to film in Kansas are gone. Time is
running too short. Snowbarger wants the ad on TV on Tuesday to give
it enough time to sink into the consciousness of 3rd District
voters.
</P>
<P>
   So St. Claire decides to film in Washington. They'll hire a
local actress.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Barbara, who refuses to give her last name but says she's
from the District of Columbia area.
</P>
<P>
   (It's common for people to show up in political commercials who
have no clue about the particular campaign. Commercials broadcast
by Moore, for instance, have shown pictures of families and prisons
that come from the stock footage of his media consulting firm _ not
from the 3rd District.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a look,'' remarks makeup artist Kimberly Foley about
Barbara. ``She's very representative of the age group.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley says she's careful not to ``overdo'' Barbara with makeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want her to look,'' Foley says, ``like someone she's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, Barbara gets some coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to punch the word `lying' a little bit more?''
asks cameraman Gino Bruno.
</P>
<P>
   Adds St. Claire: ``It's kind of like, uh, `I'm tired of
politicians like Dennis Moore (emphasis)lying(end emphasis) to us
and trying to (emphasis)scare(end emphasis) us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the big words,'' Bruno agrees. ``And uh, can you
cheat to your right just a little bit? There. Very good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barbara, we're rolling. Any time you're ready.''
</P>
<P>
   The focus groups, Moore's campaign is delighted to learn, like
this candidate on camera.
</P>
<P>
   After Moore was filmed reading three versions of his courtroom
commercial, the campaign pieced together a fourth commercial
featuring a collage of newspaper headlines and articles criticizing
Snowbarger's campaign tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my campaign experience,'' said Moore campaign press
secretary Mark Nevins, ``says you get an outside source, because no
one trusts what the campaign says.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sept. 14, when the campaign assembled two focus groups, one
of men and one of women, the newspapers didn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said you can get newspapers to say anything,'' Nevins
said, ``or you can take something from an article and take it out
of context.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they liked Moore on camera.
</P>
<P>
   With the messenger chosen, the debate turned to the message.
</P>
<P>
   One script included the idea that ``we need a congressman who'll
fight hard for...Social Security and...for a real patients' bill of
rights.''
</P>
<P>
   A third one, written by the candidate, framed the issue more
combatively. It spoke in almost laywer-to-lawyer terms and alluded
to a criminal defendant's constitutional rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vince, you're a lawyer. You ought to know better.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign opted for its simplest message.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, meantime, makes no pretense about stage fright. He made
television commercials for his races for Johnson County district
attorney and for a failed bid to become Kansas attorney general in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a campaign like this,'' he says, ``you meet as many people
as you can in person, but the truth is, most people will know you
from television.''

WHEN OUTLAW DIED IN 1930S, OUTPOURING OF RESPECT OVERWHELMED TOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALLISAW, Okla. _ Sixty-four years ago, on Oct. 28, 1934, a dust
cloud visible for miles rose from the dirt and gravel roads around
here as a vast crowd _ some estimated it at 40,000 people _
converged on a local cemetery to attend the largest funeral
Oklahoma had ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   The deceased, who lay in state beneath a graveyard arbor, was
30-year-old Charles Arthur Floyd, who had spent much of his life in
the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a sort of hero,'' said Earl Strebeck, president of the
local historical society. ``Charley robbed banks, and in those hard
times, banks were foreclosing on small farmers every day. People
here didn't think much of banks.''
</P>
<P>
   The press always called Floyd ``Pretty Boy,'' a nickname he
supposedly picked up in one of the Kansas City night spots he often
frequented on his forays through the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   But in the rolling, wooded Cookson Hills around Sallisaw, his
friends, neighbors and kin always called him Charley or ``Choc''
and protected him from the law.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, though, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover called him
Public Enemy No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   That deadly ranking was based on Hoover's assertion that Floyd
had been a triggerman in Kansas City's 1933 Union Station Massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd denied it. The chief of Kansas City's detectives privately
doubted it. And a great deal of modern research, including much
done by Robert Unger, author of The Union Station Massacre, has
cast grave doubt on Hoover's allegation.
</P>
<P>
   But in those days, Hoover's word could be a death sentence, and
on Oct. 22, 1934, under circumstances that remain murky to this
day, a posse led by federal agents shot and killed Floyd in an Ohio
cornfield.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover issued a jubilant press release. But it wasn't joy that
seized the heart of eastern Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pall of death fell over Sallisaw as a sorrowing hill
country people heard the news,'' wrote a reporter for the Muskogee
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   In Sallisaw, the townspeople took up a collection to bring
Charley back to Oklahoma. Four days later, on Friday, Oct. 26, his
body, encased in a cheap casket, arrived home at 2 in the morning
aboard a Kansas City Southern train. More than 500 people waited in
silence at the station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember that train coming, and it kept blowing its
whistle,'' Floyd's son, Dempsey, told Michael Wallis, his father's
finest biographer, many years later.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning more than a thousand people filed past Floyd's
open casket at a local funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then, on Saturday afternoon, people started coming into
town from all over,'' a retired schoolteacher named Loris Dickey
recalled last week. ``They came from everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Dickey's father, Walter Goodwin, owned a little
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people came to my father's cafe on Saturday,'' she
said, ``that they cleaned it out.'' They ate every last ounce of
redtop stew, chili, chicken-fried steak and homemade pie in the
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a bite left,'' said Dickey. ``My father had to
close. The town was filling up so fast we couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, people camped out at the cemetery in Akins,
eight miles from Sallisaw, where the burial was scheduled Sunday
afternoon. Others slept in their cars or on the side of the road.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday morning the fast-growing crowd was estimated at
between 20,000 and 40,000 people, more than 10 times the population
of Sallisaw in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were astounded,'' said Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, the folks all around here knew Charley Floyd,'' said
Shannon Magness, a Sallisaw resident. ``And they liked him. Most
came out of respect. My uncle, Taft Reed, told me that once when he
was working on a local WPA road project, Charley pulled up in his
car and handed the men on that job a bag full of money _ just gave
them all that bank money.''
</P>
<P>
   And they were happy to get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That story doesn't surprise me a bit,'' said Jerene Taylor,
whose sister was married to Floyd's brother E.W.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't unusual for Charley to do that sort of thing, and
the people around here appreciated it. Of course they did in those
days. The truth is, if you saw Charley around town you didn't think
twice about it. When he visited his sister Emma out in Akins, he'd
hide his car down in the trees. Everybody knew it. We all saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one talked to the law. And Floyd knew why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have robbed no one but moneyed men,'' he wrote on a postcard
sent to some Oklahoma lawmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here Charley Floyd could come and go as he pleased,''
said Dickey. ``He even robbed the bank in town once, and lots of
people saw it and didn't do a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That was on Nov. 1, 1932, the day Floyd casually held up the
Sallisaw State Bank in front of a crowd of friendly onlookers.
</P>
<P>
   Charley's grandfather, Earl Floyd, came over to watch the
action, but the scene was so calm that the old man fell asleep on a
bench with a plug of tobacco in his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   A Muskogee reporter named Vivian Brown, at first doubting the
Robin Hood stories surrounding Floyd, traveled through the region
and soon concluded that the tales were true: Floyd did give money
to the poverty-racked farmers he befriended in those hardscrabble
hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The penniless tenant farmers kept their mouths shut,'' she
wrote, ``they had no scruples about taking contraband wrested from
bankers.''
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday morning, Oct. 28, all the roads around Sallisaw were
jammed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad tried to come over from Fort Smith, Arkansas, to pay
his respects,'' said current Sallisaw resident Warren Magness.
``But his Model A Ford overheated in the bumper-to-bumper traffic
headed this way, and he never made it.'' MORE
</P>
<P>
   SALLISAW, Okla. _ never made it.''
</P>
<P>
   All that morning, people roamed the nearby hills picking
wildflowers to lay on Floyd's grave. Florists from Muskogee to Fort
Smith reported selling every blossom in stock. Five cars filled
with flowers later joined the funeral procession.
</P>
<P>
   ``For miles and miles, as far as you could see, cars were parked
on both sides of the road to the cemetery,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't drive anywhere near Akins,'' Dickey recalled. ``We
had to get out and walk a mile or two. There was already a huge
crowd packed into that cemetery. It was hot that day, but if you
passed out, you couldn't fall down _ the crowd was that tight. What
a sight it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Earl Strebeck's great-aunt later told him that at the funeral
she saw reporters and photographers sitting on tree branches all
along the nearby roads and around the cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Floyd's youngest sister, Mary, pulled a news
photographer out of a tree by his feet. She was in a rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shot my brother down like a dog,'' she told one reporter.
``He never had a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd's nephew, Lawton Lessley, 8 years old at the time, rode
with his family near the head of the funeral procession from
Sallisaw. The cortege was 5 miles long. People rode in cars,
trucks, buggies and wagons. Many walked.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road from here to Akins was all gravel then, and what I
remember most was the dust,'' said Lessley. There were times that
day when the dust blocked out the sun.
</P>
<P>
   After the burial, the crowd lingered for hours and then slowly
left town. By Monday morning it was gone.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after Floyd's death his story passed into folk
legend. Balladeer Woody Guthrie wrote a song about him. John
Steinbeck eulogized him in The Grapes of Wrath. Hollywood made
films about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they never did one right,'' Dempsey Floyd told the
Sequoyah County Times.
</P>
<P>
   There have been three headstones on Floyd's grave. ``The first
was chipped away by souvenir hunters; the second was stolen,''
Lessley said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Akins cemetery is peaceful now, and Floyd's grave is no
longer much disturbed. Not many even know where it's located.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only a few of us left who remember Charley at all,''
Taylor said, ``and every year his funeral just seems more and more
like a fading dream.''

NEW YORK'S LIBERAL PARTY FACES EXTINCTION
</HEADLINE>
 YORK-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last boss of New York politics has the good sense
to look like a boss. Heavy in girth, tie loosened, he sits in his
unadorned Midtown law office, smoking unfiltered Camels and taking
phone calls from everybody who's anybody, one after another,
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond B. Harding, 63, is the boss of the New York Liberal
Party, a small organization, but powerful enough to give him a hand
on the tiller of power and the ATM card that comes with it.
</P>
<P>
   The post has brought him and his law partners millions of
dollars in lobbying fees. His two sons hold six-figure jobs in City
Hall under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who owes his own title to
Harding.
</P>
<P>
   Now though, Harding's party _ one of the largest, most enduring
third parties in American politics _ is facing possible extinction
for the first time in its 54-year history.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, Harding endorsed Betsy McCaughey Ross as his party's
candidate for governor. She was the front-running Democrat. Her
financier-husband, Wilbur Ross, had promised her campaign millions.
Then, Mr. Ross withdrew his money and she took a nose dive, losing
the Democratic primary nearly 2 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   McCaughey Ross stayed in the race on the Liberal ticket, but has
had no money for campaigning. According to New York laws, a party
needs 50,000 votes in a statewide election to retain a permanent
line on the ballot. The Liberal Party is the only independent party
to be listed alongside the Democrats and Republicans. If McCaughey
Ross wins fewer than 50,000 votes Tuesday, the line disappears _
and Harding's power base crumbles.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Sheinkopf, a political consultant who once worked for
Harding, said the Liberal Party is ``a patronage party. (Hardinig)
... has no constituency. All he has is a line. If he loses that, he
has to start all over from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if McCaughey Ross does win 50,000 votes _ a little over 1
percent of the ballots likely to be cast _ Harding faces another
danger from a new third party, the Working Families Party, formed
by a group of Democrats and labor leaders for the explicit purpose
of destroying and supplanting Harding's empire.
</P>
<P>
   Harding is unperturbed. ``There have been funerals planned for
me before,'' he said. ``They've all been premature.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Party was started in 1944 by Alex Rose, a union
president who quit the American Labor Party as Communists
infiltrated its ranks. Following him was a massive constituency _
unionists and Jewish immigrants, pro-Franklin Roosevelt but
anti-Joseph Stalin, who had no desire to join the Irish machine
that controlled the city's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberals supplied the margins to elect Robert Wagner mayor,
Hugh Carey and Mario Cuomo governors, Jacob Javits senator, and
even won New York _ and, as a result, the nation _ for John F.
Kennedy in the 1960 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   It rose to its greatest heights a few years later, with the
mayoralty of John Lindsey, who ran as a ``fusion candidate'' on the
Republican and Liberal tickets. Lindsey could not have won the
heavily Democratic city just as a Republican. As a reward, Rose's
son was made tax commissioner, two of his son's law partners were
named judges, and over 100 party members were given plum jobs,
including three deputy mayorships.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1970s, the generation that formed the party's core
began to die off. In 1976, Rose suddenly died, triggering a
succession war.
</P>
<P>
   Harding recalled the battle: ``There was Edward A. Morrison, a
deputy mayor in the Lindsey administration, very erudite and
polished. And there was a rough-cut diamond whose forte was
petition-wars and running organizations and a penchant for never
failing to return a phone call. ... The rough-cut one _ that's me _
emerged as the leader.''
</P>
<P>
   The rough diamond was born in Yugoslavia under the name Branko
Hochwald. He and his parents survived the Holocaust, and, in 1944,
came to America along with 1,000 other Jewish refugees that US
Interior Department agents picked up along the liberation trails of
Italy. He changed his name, after a character on a radio serial. In
1958, following college, law school, and the Army, he joined the
Liberal Party and rose through the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Richard C. Wade, a history professor at City University of New
York and a former party higher-up, remembers him well. ``Harding
was the nuts-and-bolts guy,'' he said. ``In a primary,
nuts-and-bolts are all there is. He saw all the money passing up
and down, and figured that was what American politics were all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, his power within the party absolute, Harding set out to
make Giuliani the mayor. Edward Koch, in his third term, was mired
in scandal, and Harding saw in Giuliani _ a US attorney who had
fought corruption and the Mafia _ the makings of another
reform-fusion candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani ran on the Republican and Liberal tickets, but lost to
David Dinkins, who had unexpectedly defeated Koch in the Democratic
primary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Giuliani tried again and won. He picked up 65,000 votes
on the Liberal line _ mainly from Democrats reluctant to pull the
Republican lever. The figure exceeded his 50,000-vote margin over
Dinkins. Without Harding, Giuliani might not have run and certainly
would not have won.
</P>
<P>
   Wade is one of many who saw Harding's new alliance with Giuliani
_ a conservative figure by New York City standards _ as a betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Liberal Party used to be the conscience of this state, the
party of high intellect,'' Wade said. ``Now it's just a bag
operation. It's about patronage and money _ that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Harding openly remained a political adviser to Mayor Giuliani,
while at the same time lobbying City Hall on behalf of nearly 60
clients. (During Dinkins's tenure, the firm had only three lobbying
clients.)
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a single story that showed the commission of a
single impropriety,'' Harding said of this connection. He added
that he personally has not done any lobbying since last June.
</P>
<P>
   He also denied cronyism in Giuliani's appointment of his two
sons to positions in which they had no previous experience. Russell
Harding, 34, heads the city's housing office, a $110,000-a-year
job; Robert, 40, is budget director, at $137,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were growing up, at our family dinner table,''
Harding said of his sons, with a slight smile, ``art and music were
not the subjects of discussion.'' They volunteered for Giuliani's
campaigns, earned his trust, and became part of his inner circle,
he said _ that's all.
</P>
<P>
   Wade mused that if McCaughey Ross proves Harding's downfall, it
would be just desserts. Ross was a conservative Republican _
Governor George W. Pataki's running mate _ who became a liberal
Democrat only after Pataki ignored and belittled her.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens Tuesday, Harding is unlikely to disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the smartest inside-players in politics
anyplace,'' Sheinkopf said. ``He's a survivor.''

VERSATILE BUCKEYES TURN BACK HOOSIERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMINGTON, Ind. _ Back in 1996, Ohio State clinched a Rose
Bowl berth here in Memorial Stadium, sending a wave of Buckeyes
fans on to the field to tear down the south goal post. Insulted,
Hoosiers players sprinted to the other end, circled the north post
and dared anyone to come get them.
</P>
<P>
   But Indiana needed to take more than umbrage to keep the
Buckeyes' offense out of the end zone Saturday. Ohio State rolled
over the Hoosiers, 38-7.
</P>
<P>
   On Halloween afternoon, Ohio State came dressed as a football
powerhouse. But the Buckeyes' costume showed the occasional tear in
the form of 124 yards in penalties and a fumble near the goal line,
that only bolstered critics' arguments that a soft schedule and
some lackadaisical lapses in play earned them the No. 2 spot in the
new Bowl Championship Series ranking behind UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   But it was hard not to be impressed by the array of weapons Ohio
State deployed to maul a much improved Indiana team. Ohio State
quarterback Joe Germain passed for more than 300 yards for the
fourth straight game (the fifth time this season) and threw for
three touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver David Boston, a Biletnikoff award candidate,
returned a punt 70 yards for a touchdown and caught two passes for
scores on a 110-yard day.
</P>
<P>
   His teammate Dee Miller grabbed 11 passes for 159 yards.
Tailback Michael Wiley ran for 80 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   And the Buckeyes' defense proved as persistent and painful as
the most lethal strain of killer bees by swarming all over Indiana
quarterback Antwaan Randle El.
</P>
<P>
   The redshirt freshman quarterback titillated the capacity crowd
of 52,049 with jitterbug moves down the line of scrimmage as he ran
the option. With eight seconds left in the first half, he rolled
left and heaved a 37-yard touchdown pass across his body to Levron
Williams that gave Indiana its first points and threatened to make
a game of it at 21-7.
</P>
<P>
   But Randle El _ who threw for 218 yards but rushed for only 27 _
will have to take his revenge out on the Buckeyes on the basketball
court this winter, when he will try to become the first Indiana
player to start in both sports as a member of Bob Knight's team. He
looked like a scout team quarterback Saturday compared to Ohio
State's Germaine who, in stealth fashion, is piling up yardage and
insinuating himself into the Heisman Trophy race.
</P>
<P>
   Germaine was a junior college transfer, who worked his way into
a part-time starting role last year, and this year has become Ohio
State's most valuable player. He threw for 351 yards on 31-of-45
passing Saturday, leading scoring drives of 50, 75, 69, 43 and 60
yards. But the most telling statistic was his 7-for-11 accuracy on
third-down passes.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt that the Buckeyes have been transformed
into a passing team and Germaine is among the best quarterbacks in
the nation, it was dispelled on a 75-yard scoring drive late in the
first half that put away the Hoosiers for good. Germaine went to
the air 7 times, completing 5, including a crucial third and 10
pass to Miller for 16 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On fourth and less than a yard on the Hoosiers' 6-yard line,
Cooper sold Indiana the old Woody Hayes 3-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust
but gave them Houdini-In-The-Air. Germaine took the snap, tucked
the ball behind his back with his right hand and offered tailback
Joe Montgomery his empty hand. The Hoosiers, their fans _ even
Coach Cam Cameron _ followed Montgomery into the pile.
</P>
<P>
   But Germaine tossed a soft pass to John Lumpkin wide open in the
end zone. Cooper relied on Germaine's play action passing again in
the first drive of the second half, and this time the quarterback
turned a third and goal into a 3-yard touchdown pass to Boston in
the flat to go up by 28-7.
</P>
<P>
   On their next scoring drive, Cooper crossed up the Hoosiers
again by going over them rather than through them. On third-and-1,
inside Indiana's 25-yard line, Wiley threw a halfback option to
Lumpkin to keep the drive alive.
</P>
<P>
   Special teams put the Buckeyes on the board first when David
Boston picked up a low punt on one bounce at his own 30 and found
the right side of field rolled out like a red carpet. The Buckeyes'
return team sealed out the Hoosiers so effectively that Boston
didn't even see a red jersey until he stiff-armed punter Drew Hagan
at the Indiana 28-yard line and skipped into the end zone.

   LAHAINA, Hawaii _ Jan Shishido admits it. When she lived on
Oahu, Hawaii's hub, she used to look down on the other islands. She
considered them unsophisticated country folk.
</P>
<P>
   Then the fifth-grade schoolteacher moved to more laid-back Maui.
That was 15 years ago, and now she is full of outer-island pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be ignored anymore,'' Shishido said,
``because the person in charge is going to be one of us.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in state history, the next governor of Hawaii
could be someone from an island other than Oahu, where most of the
people, businesses, and government offices are. Even more
unthinkable _ for the first time since 1962 that someone could be a
Republican, a political change almost on par with the overthrow of
Queen Liliuokalani in 1893 and the annexation of the islands by the
United States in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   The support for such a change shows just how unhappy voters are
in the Aloha State, where even endless blue skies and blue water
can't make up for nearly eight years of economic misery. Hammered
by Asia's financial crisis, tourist spending is down, bankruptcies
are up, foreign investment is off, new construction is virtually
nil. The Bank of Hawaii is predicting no growth at all for 1998.
For many unemployed Hawaiians, the only option has been a move to
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Now voters have another alternative to consider: ousting
first-term Governor Benjamin Cayetano in favor of Maui Mayor Linda
Lingle. With the general election just days away, she continues to
lead in the polls, although the gap is narrowing. She also won the
endorsement of the Honolulu Advertiser, Hawaii's largest newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clear that people are in shock enough to consider
a haole (caucasian) Republican woman from Maui,'' said Paul
Brewbaker, chief economist at the Bank of Hawaii in Honolulu. ``The
idea of structural change, real change, is on most people's minds,
and I'd include Democrats in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Cayetano, the nation's first governor of Filipino ancestry,
blames many of Hawaii's problems on external factors beyond his
control: the weak Japanese yen today, and the California recession,
and Persian Gulf War before that. Each kept away the tourists who
are the state's $10 billion-a-year mainstay. There was even a
devastating hurricane, Iniki, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cayetano, 58, knows voters want new leadership in
Honolulu. He says he represents it.
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1994, Cayetano reduced the state budget, eliminated
state jobs, and cut personal income taxes. He went to work on the
state budget deficit. Like Lingle, 45, he is looking to high
technology, health care, and streamlined business regulations to
help Hawaii take part in the US recovery that passed it by.
Overall, their economic platforms sound remarkably similar.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cayetano, whose negative poll ratings remained high
in the race's final stretch, the governor's race ``wouldn't even be
close if it weren't for the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter why the economy is bad, people always blame the
incumbent,'' said Ry Barbin, chairman of the Maui County Democratic
Party. ``He has done something similar to Bill Clinton. He came
into office and took a lot of what were previously considered
conservative issues and made them his own. That's the message we
have to get out: He is a change from previous Democratic
administrations.''
</P>
<P>
   But the people attending a Lingle fund-raiser the other night _
many of them former Democrats like Jan Shishido, others Democrats
making a rare crossover vote, and still others among the state's
Republican minority _ are demanding a change of face and style.
Several described Lingle, a two-term mayor and former council
member who has lived in the islands since 1975, as one politician
certain to eradicate the cronyism that symbolizes state government.
She would also be the first woman to run the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows the islands are going down the tubes fast
financially,'' said Al Litman, an independent who moved to Maui
from Los Angeles five years ago after he retired. ``She sees the
waste in government. She sees that we have to make our own
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Downplaying her party affiliation and St. Louis roots, Lingle
touts the privatization of government services _ heresy in a state
with powerful public-sector unions. She likes to note that the
number of jobs has risen on Maui since 1994, while Hawaii has lost
some 9,000 overall. Locals point to the parks and swimming pools
she got built.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has positioned herself as the people's candidate and it's
working,'' said Donna Alcantara, who heads Hawaii's Republican
Party. ``Her message is resonating among Democrats like never
before. People are really hurting and she's tapped into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yasumasa Kuroda, a political science professor at the University
of Hawaii in Honolulu, said he registers only minor differences in
the candidates' messages, since neither can control the world
economy. But her message has been the bolder, he added, because it
emphasizes economic stagnation _ a point the incumbent cannot
concede.
</P>
<P>
   Although heavy crossover voting is expected, Democrats have a
history of last-minute turnarounds in Hawaii. Other Republicans
have come close to the governor's mansion in recent years. This
race is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people know is that they don't want another four years
like the last four years,'' said Kuroda.

REAL ESTATE: FOR SALES OF SECOND HOMES, NO VACATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Vt.)  (lb) 
 By TRISH HALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This is a busy time for real estate brokers in the
picture-perfect small towns of the Northeast as they race from
closing to closing, getting customers into weekend houses in time
to inaugurate the new lodgings with a Thanksgiving turkey.
</P>
<P>
   It is also, by and large, a rich time. Some brokers have had
their best year ever as affluent buyers have increasingly come to
view the second home as an integral part of life, an accessory as
necessary as a sports utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, many brokers say, the volatile stock market has so
far had a minimal effect on sales. Although in some areas there has
been a lessening of interest in properties costing more than $1
million, there is no widespread indication that the market for
second homes is being affected. With interest rates at some of
their lowest levels in 30 years, even buyers who are nervous about
the direction of the economy are seduced by the financing
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   While prices in many areas rose significantly from last fall
through the spring, they have leveled off, many brokers say, making
this seem an opportune time to buy. Asking prices are not, however,
generally being cut. The sale of a second home is often
discretionary, and if there are no takers, the owner can just hold
on to it or rent until the market seems more favorable.
</P>
<P>
   While buyers can still find houses within three hours of New
York that offer a few acres, and maybe even access to a stream or
lake, for less than $120,000, prices of substantial houses in the
sought-after communities are well over $250,000, and sales have
been brisk, with some brokers saying that their sales for the year
are up 40 to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, inventory is depleted, and there is much less for
sale than there was a few years ago. Some brokers now say their
biggest problem is finding homes to show.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of second homes take place most often in the spring and
fall, but they are increasingly occurring throughout the year
because the homes are no longer merely seasonal retreats. Houses in
ski country are used in the summer because there are usually nearby
lakes and golf courses. Beach houses in towns with the bookstores,
restaurants and other services that city people want are
increasingly drawing year-round visitors who are also pleased by
the peacefulness of a fall day at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend houses, too, are no longer strictly weekend houses, now
that time away from the office can, for increasing numbers of the
fortunate, be stretched to three or four days as e-mail, faxes and
voice mail make it possible to work from any location.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, Madison, Conn., a lovely town of about
15,000 on the water about 20 minutes east of New Haven. Twenty
years ago, summer visitors tended to come from Connecticut, from
landlocked cities like Hartford, an hour to the northwest. But
increasingly, New Yorkers have discovered Madison, which is a
two-hour drive from New York City.
</P>
<P>
   They are drawn by the pretty main street and its mix of stores,
by the great homemade meat loaf at Sweet and Savory, and readings
by well-known authors _ among them Judy Collins, Joan Lunden and
Anne Rice _ at the bookstore R.J. Julia.
</P>
<P>
   And they are drawn by a peaceful waterfront on Long Island Sound
that seems to offer blue vistas at every turn, as well as down the
town's many small streets that end at the water's edge.
</P>
<P>
   There are few garish houses here. Many are from the end of the
last century and the beginning of this one, cottages that sit cheek
by jowl on small lots. They have been winterized and now sell for
$250,000 for small houses and up to $800,000 or more for waterfront
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Muir, who began visiting Madison as a child, has been
selling real estate in the town for nine years. Prices have risen
substantially in the last year, she said, as ``people discover
that, as nice as it is to be here in the summer, this is New
England.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fall there is cider making, and sitting in front of a
fire,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of Madison seems to be growing, too, in
anticipation of a new high-speed rail line, due in 2000 or so, that
will cut the travel time to 80 minutes _ 60 minutes to New Haven,
and a 20-minute drive. Large sums of money are being invested,
primarily by families from New York, to renovate and winterize the
old cottages.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as in other communities where some houses sell for more
than $1 million, Ms. Muir, a broker at Page Taft on Wall Street in
Madison, has noticed less interest in the very expensive properties
since the stock market's volatility began. ``I think there's a
response to the stock market,'' she said. ``I think there's a
hesitation and an overall anxiety.'' On the other hand, she said,
``I don't think we've fallen apart here.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong market for second homes in the New York region has
sent many people to mortgage brokers for financing. ``The last 12
months have been one of the busiest times we've seen in the
vacation home market,'' said Steven Schnall, the president of New
York Mortgage Corp., a mortgage broker that handles loans in
Connecticut, New York and New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The strong economy and the rising stock market contributed, he
said, but so did greater flexibility by lenders, who now allow
buyers to put down just 10 percent, compared with 20 percent or 30
percent in the past.
</P>
<P>
   After the stock market drop in the summer, he said, action in
general in the city and in the second home market slowed down a
bit, but the volume of sales did not significantly change. ``They
just weren't jumping as quickly,'' he said. Now, with the market
seeming more stable, he said, people are buying, but in a more
measured, less frantic way than they were earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   While sales of second homes vary from market to market, and
while they are naturally affected by the economy, the country in
general is likely to have more people with second homes because the
number of people in the age categories most likely to buy vacation
homes is growing.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Phillips, a senior vice president at Economics Research
Associates, a consulting firm in Washington that focuses on
recreational real estate, said that people in their early 50s were
most likely to buy second homes, in part because they are in their
peak earning years, and in part because their children are likely
to be older and they have more free time.
</P>
<P>
   As the baby-boom generation moves into its 50s, ownership of
second homes is likely to increase, he said. And in fact, it is
already happening. While there was no growth through the first half
of this decade in the purchase of second homes, the number of
second homes nationwide increased by more than 200,000 in 1996, and
again by the same number in 1997, according to the Census Bureau.

SCORING WINS NFL CHAMPIONSHIPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the NFL owners met last week in Kansas City, they discussed
many issues, but they worried about only one.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of offense.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, when have NFL owners, general managers, competition
committee members, etc. ``not'' fretted over offensive decline?
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones: ``In my time in the league _ 10 years _ there's
never been a meeting when it didn't come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox TV's Pat Summerall: ``The rules keep changing, trying to
provide more offensive production. But nothing has worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Chan Gailey claimed to have the solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a game where defensive people keep getting bigger,
faster and stronger, but the size of the field has stayed the
same,'' said Gailey. ``Every season there's a smaller area to run
your offense. We need a larger field.''
</P>
<P>
   He was kidding. I think.
</P>
<P>
   That old football thing about ``defense wins championships,'' is
less valid today than ever. The best teams have high-powered
offensive units. But in the marketing of the NFL, ``defense wins
championships'' never did apply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do touchdowns translate to a more entertaining game?'' asked
Jones. ``Probably. The league has set a minimum standard of 40
points combined for each game. That's what we'd like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Dream on.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to the owners in Kansas City, ``we were told 16
percent of the games this season have had 25 points or less,'' said
Jones. ``And that's up from last season. Obviously, the trend is
going in a direction we don't want.''
</P>
<P>
   With 40 points combined being the league goal, that hasn't been
met in 54 of 106 games through last weekend. It's a 51 percent
``failure'' rate, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of that,'' noted Summerall, ``goes back to the quality of
quarterback play. No one who regularly watches the NFL has to be
reminded just how subpar it has become.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the problem, the trend continues.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, Jerry Jones has to be given credit for his thought
process last January and February. Remember how the search for a
new head coach was dragging, and also constantly changing, not
necessarily for the better? Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was having an offensive obsession. His new man absolutely
had to be an offensive guy. For example, George Seifert had the
name, had the skins on the wall from his San Francisco 49er days,
had a desire for the job, but his expertise was defense. George
received lip-service but no serious consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect what goes on, coaching-wise, on the defensive side,
but the biggest challenge in the NFL today is trying to devise ways
to move the football,'' said Jones. ``I believed that, and then I
was constantly having it reinforced by people I talked with _ like
Joe Gibbs. Joe was one of those who felt strongly that the head
coach should be a major offensive contributor.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs, of couse, was that in his Washington Redskin tenure.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the history of the Cowboys told Jones all he needed
to know.
</P>
<P>
   What was Tom Landry's role? Then came Jimmy Johnson, who
bestowed total offensive power upon Norv Turner. Only then did the
Cowboys of the '90s start to pop. The team started to die when
Jones made his next head coaching hire, which had nothing to do
with offense or defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Miami, Jimmy has almost gone the other way from the way it
was in Dallas,'' said Summerall. ``Dan Marino was telling John
(Madden) and myself that he now can't change a play at the line of
scrimmage.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones appeared to call a sudden audible last February with
former UCLA coach Terry Donahue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the word got out that Terry didn't end up here because
we were haggling over money,'' said Jones. ``But that's not true.
We couldn't come up with a way for Terry to call the plays. He
hadn't done so in 15 years, and never in the NFL. That's why I
wasn't comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a surprise candidate surfaced in Chan Gailey, then
the offensive coordinator of the Pittsburgh Steelers. All the
offensive criteria was met, and then Jones became convinced that
Gailey could provide the complete head coaching package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people now think Chan turned out to be the right
hire,'' said Jones. ``I'm certainly one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   Due to the injury to Troy Aikman, however, Gailey's offensive
influence had yet to be fully measured. Aikman is back tomorrow
night in Philadelphia, and an offensive jump by the Cowboys is
needed.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL is all about scoring to win. But the scoring part
continues to be a lingering problem, now more than ever.
</P>

A MESSAGE FROM JORDAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This is All Souls Day. We pray for the souls of those who have
departed in the previous year. But spare your prayers for Michael
Jordan. To paraphrase Bob Dylan, ``He ain't goin' nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   How can we deduce otherwise after seeing Jordan in his latest
incarnation, that of John L. Lew-is/Sam-uel Gompers? Who knows what
spawned this miraculous transformation, but Jordan must be intent
on playing at least one more year. Why else do it?
</P>
<P>
   You can read Jordan's remarks about owing future players
something, but we know better than that. Jordan does nothing if it
doesn't benefit Jordan. It's not being selfish. It's the real
world, NBA style. The future players will do quite nicely whether
Jordan does a Jerry Springer with Abe Pollin or stays on the golf
course for bimonthly cell phone updates.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan doesn't need any of this. He saved the league before by
coming back from baseball. Now he can save it again, this time by
doing something he previously found about as appealing as Jerry
Krause: collect-ive bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it also wasn't by accident that Jordan surfaced at
the two dog-and-pony shows staged by the union. There were minicams
there. But he also stayed in New York last Wednesday night and was
an engaged participant in the eight-hour bargaining session. He
didn't have to do that.
</P>
<P>
   We long ago stopped taking Jordan at his word. He wasn't going
to play again after retiring. He wasn't going to play in the United
Center. He wasn't going to play for anyone but Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But the man loves challenges. And what greater one than the one
before him now: saving a season in jeopardy? Almost 1,200 games! He
could then re-sign with the Bulls _ oh, there's the money thing,
too _ and prove he can win with Tim Floyd, Frank Hamblin, or
whoever coaches him. Another challenge. Another milestone.
</P>
<P>
   Then we can all go through this again next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's chat with Pollin underscored what many feel is the core
problem of the ongoing dispute: credibility. The players have seen
the books and they still don't believe the owners are in anything
close to dire straits. Why else would they go into the deal asking
for 63 percent of the revenues when the owners blew up the last
deal because it reached 51.8 percent? Jordan even used the word
``snook-ered'' in one of the sessions. You can relate to the
players' concerns when some owners willingly take losses and don't
care. And even perennial money-loser Indiana spent millions on
 &UR; Larry Bird  &LR; and is moving into a beautiful new arena. The league's
response is pretty basic: Teams as a whole are paying out more
money than they are receiving; that can't continue. Jordan related
a revealing anecdote last Wednesday while waiting for the players'
meeting to start. It went like this: If you buy a house in my
neighborhood, and then you can't afford to stay there, do you pass
the hat among your neighbors? No, you sell the house. That's
basically what he told Pollin, who is the senior owner in the NBA
and one of the acknowledged hawks in the dispute. (He's also the
one who paid  &UR; Juwan Howard  &LR; and  &UR; Chris Webber &LR; ) ... While the NBA
says that everything is included when basketball revenues are
calculated, one source of money is not: licensing. That's a totally
separate agreement. The NBA and the players split money from any
licensed product that has a player's likeness or name and a team
name. The players get 100 percent of the money if it's simply a
player's likeness. The league sent the players $25 million for
their half of the licensing. Jordan said he thought the figure
should have been much, much higher, but the league says that is not
the case ... Who's at fault? The internet site CBS/Sportsline asked
that of its readers. More than 30,000 responses came in and 63.4
percent blamed the players while 36.6 percent blamed the owners ...
Right now, there are three dates we hear for opening the season.
The first is Dec. 1, although that would require a signed deal in a
week, which certainly doesn't seem likely based on what people were
saying last Thursday. The second is Christmas. NBC craves that game
and has a doubleheader scheduled featuring the Kings, Grizzlies,
Mavericks, and Raptors. Only kidding. It's Chicago, New York, Los
Angeles, and Phoenix. The third date is Jan. 1. One scenario
outlined Friday had the league redoing the entire schedule, with
all teams playing each other twice. That would result in a 56-game
season. Another option would be to add games at the end of the
season, although that would push the season to the end of June.
Then again, if Jordan is playing, neither the NBA nor NBC will care
if it goes into August.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pete Vecsey  &LR; of the New York Post reported Friday that  &UR; Antoine
Walker  &LR; will be traded to Miami after the lockout ends for  &UR; P.J.
Brown  &LR; and  &UR; Jamal Mashburn &LR; . That makes as much sense as any of the
other Walker trade rumors we've heard (Portland, Orlando) except
for the fact that it makes a small team (Miami) even smaller.
There's no doubt the Celtics have been shopping Walker, generally
to teams with free-spending owners. But if there is a deal,  &UR; Rick
Pitino  &LR; will see that at least two of his many contract
undesirables ( &UR; Pervis Ellison &LR; , &UR; Greg Minor &LR; , &UR; Dontae Jones &LR; , &UR;  &LR; even
 &UR; Dana Barros &LR; ) are included. It also will be interesting to see
whether the Celtics go forward with a deal if the new bargaining
agreement gives them another year with Walker or limits what Walker
could make as a free agent. Would Pitino keep him, or has the
relationship soured to the point of no return? And if it's strictly
economics, will Pitino stick around if his hands are tied by
ownership? ... The Kings have hired former Laker guard  &UR; Byron Scott
 &LR; as an assistant coach under new mentor  &UR; Rick Adelman &LR; . Scott
played last year in Greece with  &UR; Dino Radja  &LR; for Pana-thinaikos.
Also on Adelman's staff is former Michigan head coach  &UR; Steve
Fisher &LR; , who will, among other things, babysit Webber, and longtime
Adelman crony  &UR; John Wetzel  &LR; ...  &UR; M.L. Carr  &LR; reports he's still
trying to shake down rich guys for the Celtics in his role as
executive vice president for economic development. Carr now has two
children in college and a third in boarding school, meaning three
hefty tuition bills. ``All those times I used to tell kids to stay
in school,'' he said. ``I should tell my kids to go hardship.'' ...
The breakup of the  &UR; Stephon Marbury &LR; - &UR; Eric Fleisher  &LR; relationship
came over a shoe deal. According to a report in Street &AMP; Smith
Business Daily, Fleisher, who represents the Timberwolves' guard,
turned down a $1.8 million offer, and later a $1 million deal, from
Puma. Puma then gave the money to  &UR; Vince Carter &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and Marbury,
apparently, will give a cut of his future earnings to  &UR; David Falk
 &LR; ... The Nets' new ownership group has one man in charge of the
basketball end but several minority partners. One of those is team
president  &UR; Michael Rowe &LR; , who got 1 percent of the $150 million
sale. One who isn't is coach  &UR; John Calipari &LR; . Read into that what
you will, but Rowe and Cal didn't always see eye-to-eye last year
on how the team should spend its money. Cal has an out clause after
this year ... Speaking of the Nets, we asked  &UR; Keith Van Horn  &LR; what
he thought of the ownership change. ``I don't know,'' he said. ``I
didn't even know the last ones.''

 NEW YORK: Census Bureau.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   People looking for a second home often start by thinking about
whether they want the mountains, farmland or the beach, regardless
of whether they plan to use their house primarily in summer or
winter. And if they are attracted to mountains, an obvious first
place to look is Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Some devotees of northern Vermont, which attracts people from
all over the world, will sneer that the southern part of the state
is just a suburb of New York City. There's a reason for that. While
northern Vermont is a six-hour drive, southern Vermont is just
three-and-a-half to four-and-a-half hours away.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last decade, properties in many parts of Vermont
were relative bargains, and many towns have still not recaptured
the house prices they saw during the boom days of the mid-1980s.
Condos meant for skiers were particularly slow to recover.
</P>
<P>
   But even the condo market has strengthened significantly.
Although prices are not as high as they were just before the stock
market collapse of 1987, sales have been booming. As an example of
how well things are selling, Paul Sherwood of Century 21 Carriage
Realty in West Dover, in the southern part of Vermont, singled out
one of his favorite condo complexes, Timber Creek, in West Dover
directly across from Mount Snow.
</P>
<P>
   With 212 units, it has swimming pools, saunas, cross-country
trails, a clubhouse, weight rooms, racquetball courts, firewood
delivered to the door, and shuttle-bus service to the ski lift. The
condos, between 2,000 and 2,900 square feet, are priced from
$139,000 to $189,000 and are selling extremely well, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sherwood remembers 1990 and 1991, when 52 units were for
sale, about a quarter of the complex. Now, only seven are for sale.
``I'm begging owners to list with me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The last month, Sherwood said, has been his busiest time.
``October is when we have our World Series,'' he said. Buyers start
``kicking the tires'' in June, then start getting serious after
Labor Day, so they can be in their new homes by Thanksgiving, he
said. Usually, he said, ``when the last leaf hits the ground, the
last buyer disappears.'' But that has not been the case this year.
``It's remarkably busy,'' he said. ``The people are still coming.
This past weekend, I didn't have enough time to see all the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   A typical buyer, he said, is a single man in his late 20s who
works on Wall Street. Places are selling twice as quickly as they
did last year, in an average of 60 days, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As of mid-October, Sherwood said, he had closed more than $8
million in sales this year, up from $7 million for all of 1997, and
his best quarter is typically the fourth, which is still to come.
Sales have not been hurt by the stock market or by by a new
statewide property tax system, meant to equalize education
spending, that has raised many assessments, some by as much as 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, prices are far below what they were at their
height in the '80s for condos, and houses are 30 percent to 35
percent less. In those wild days, he said, people were buying
investment property; now they are picking out houses they plan to
use, although they will sometimes rent them out in summer to defray
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been in a buyers' market for 10 years,'' said
Sherwood, a retired New York dentist who has been selling real
estate in Vermont for 11 years. ``We're not yet in a sellers'
market, but inventory is depleted, and prices are tending to go
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Business is also booming in other parts of Vermont that attract
many New Yorkers. Terry Hill, president of the South Central
Vermont Board of Realtors, which represents brokers in Stratton,
Weston, Dorset and Manchester, said that ``business has been very
good for the last year, and especially for the last six or seven
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hill said she expected that sales volume for the year would
be 40 percent higher than last year. Buyers tend to be families in
their mid-30s who see their homes as year-round retreats. ``In past
years, you might only see the owner from Christmas to March,'' she
said. ``Now, you're seeing them year-round, because there are so
many things to do in southern Vermont. We have fly fishing, and
beautiful golf courses.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dorset may be a four-hour drive from New York City, Stowe
is much farther north, a six-hour drive or a one-hour flight to
Burlington, 35 minutes away. Pall Spera, who has been selling real
estate in the area for 30 years, said that there are more
conversations now about the stock market, but it doesn't seem to be
a factor in the sale of homes in the $300,000 to $400,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have such absolutely provocative rates,'' he said, ``and we
are still very cheap as resort real estate goes.'' His company's
sales were 50 percent higher this year, he said, in part because
Vermont's isolation is countered by technology. ``They can be there
and not feel disconnected,'' he said, because of e-mail and the
like. ``People are coming Thursday night and leaving Monday. The
weekend is three to four days.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem now, he said, is a lack of houses for sale.
``We've cleaned out the pantry,'' he said. The most sought-after
type of property in Stowe these days, he said, is a contemporary
Vermont farmhouse, which has clapboards and an angled roof. ``It's
like Norman Rockwell, but the windows are larger, and it is
cathedralized inside, with an open conversation area from the
living room to the kitchen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The old houses in the village are less popular, he said, because
although they are quaint, they are ``rabbits' warrens of small
rooms.''

 NEW YORK: small rooms.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   While people may initially be drawn to Stowe by the skiing, he
said, it is a year-round resort where the local shops are busier in
spring, summer and fall than they are in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   A similar evolution has occurred in the Hamptons, where
restaurants no longer shut down in the winter and social life no
longer stops after Labor Day. ``It's not a seasonal resort
anymore,'' said Frank Newbold, a vice president of Sotheby's
International Realty and manager of the East Hampton office.
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, Newbold has been renting houses in the
fall, from September through December, ``when you don't have to
wait in line to buy a tomato,'' and when a house within walking
distance of the beach that would be $25,000 for August is only
$2,000 a month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Newbold used to find that his busiest times were in the
spring and September, spring is now far more important, he said.
Wall Street people in New York receive their bonuses in January and
February, so they are ready to shop seriously in the spring. By
September, and especially this fall, they may not be so certain of
their future economic status, and they wait for the next bonus.
</P>
<P>
   So people who shop for houses in the fall may have a better
chance of getting a good deal, he said, because there are fewer
buyers to compete with and some sellers want to unload their
properties before winter begins.
</P>
<P>
   The recent volatility of the stock market, he said, has not
affected prices of the better properties, but it has brought out
people who are apparently hoping that this is the time to find a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prices are absolutely the same'' in the prime areas, he
said, although in less prestigious sections, prices have fallen by
about 5 percent, in a ``little bit of a wave of reality.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first part of the summer, with the stock market booming,
brokers were willing to put on high prices, thinking they might get
them. But how, he said, ``we are encouraging people to be more
realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Litchfield County, the wealthy northwest corner of Connecticut,
is also finding relatively little impact from the stock market,
brokers said. It's a place that likes to think of itself as the
un-Hamptons, as restrained and refined as the Hamptons are showy.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in Litchfield County have gone up about 10 percent in the
last year, and sales have been brisk, said Carolyn Klemm, whose
company, Klemm Realty in Washington, Conn., recently sold the
Warren home of the best-selling romance novelist Barbara Taylor
Bradford for $2.5 million. Even after the stock market collapse in
1987, she said, ``we only had a few deals that went south.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, she said, ``We've had our best year ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly pretty country views, with lower prices, are found in
Dutchess and Columbia counties in New York, on the east side of the
Hudson River. Sales have also been booming, but prices are not as
high as they were before the stock market collapse of 1987, brokers
said. Susan Lott, a broker in Chatham who covers most of Columbia
County, said that houses for sale include $123,000 for a
``dollhouse'' on a pretty half acre in North Chatham and $345,000
for a center-hall Colonial with four bedrooms and an artist's
studio on seven acres in Spencertown.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she said, she will try to tempt New Yorkers to go
farther out, into Rensselaer County, for instance, where prices are
lower, but most people do not want to drive more than two hours.
The Taconic Parkway ends in Columbia County, in Chatham, she said,
and ``people don't want to go that extra distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Gabel said that most of the houses she sells in Columbia
County go for between $250,000 and $600,000 and that some customers
are becoming frustrated by the lack of properties available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many buyers we're selling out of everything,'' she
said. Not much is being built, either, in part, she said, because
many New Yorkers, when they have a chance to buy land contiguous to
their properties, snap it up so they can be sure it doesn't end up
being developed.
</P>
<P>
   Less expensive country retreats have always been found on the
west side of the Hudson River, around Woodstock and New Paltz, and
west, in the Catskill Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   While there are certainly pockets of wealth in those areas,
there are generally many lovely houses to be found for less. But in
those areas, inventory is low because sales have been strong,
brokers said.
</P>
<P>
   Gale Brownlee, a broker at Century 21 Eichhorn Realty in the
center of Woodstock, said that many self-employed people are buying
houses in the area because it is two hours from New York and they
can easily go into the city when they need to for business.
</P>
<P>
   They are attracted by the town's history as an artists colony,
Ms. Brownlee said. Usually, she said, they start out by saying they
want seclusion _ but what they really want is reasonable privacy
and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   George Danskin, a broker at Julien J. Studley Inc. in nearby New
Paltz, said it was still possible to buy a cottage near the Mohonk
Preserve for $125,000. Danskin said he recently sold an
18th-century stone house with great valley views, on two and a half
acres, for $185,000. ``People can establish a foothold here and
have a weekend retreat and not have a king's ransom to pay'' and
still be just 90 miles from the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recreation, not chic stores, draws people to Ulster County, he
said. In fact, Danskin said, ``I don't think you can get off the
Thruway without a bicycle rack on your car.''
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, in Delaware County, about three hours from New
York City, there is fishing in the summer, and skiing in the winter
at Belleayre. Prices have gone up, but they are still relatively
low, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
   A ski house with three bedrooms and two baths, on five acres, is
for sale at $125,000. A three-bedroom log house on 10 acres just
sold for $154,000, while a farmhouse with a barn and a pond on 46
acres went for $240,000, according to Ed Ludde, a salesperson at
Terra Real Estate in Margaretville.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Anderson, a senior vice president at Sotheby's
International Realty, is one of the few real-estate specialists who
have a perspective on a large geographic area. He supervises an
11-state region, from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut down
through Kentucky and Tennessee. He has been struck in recent years
by the number of sales he sees at the higher end of the price range
for vacation homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been surprised at how many of these more-expensive
homes are secondary homes,'' he said. The buyers are younger than
in the past, as young as 28, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He is just as struck, he said, by the lack of impact, so far, of
the volatility in the financial world. ``The stock market is
bouncy,'' he said. ``The real estate market is not.''

PATRIOTS MUST BE WARY OF COLTS

</P>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ When the Patriots landed in this Midwestern city,
there should have been a sign that said, ``Welcome to the Danger
Zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Armstrong was correct when he predicted that the Jets game
two weeks ago would be ``a trap.'' Sunday's Colts game could be a
catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could be'' is the key phrase, and the one the Patriots, to a
man, hope does not enter into the equation. For they can ill afford
another divisional loss. If they are accused of not being able to
win the tough games, they certainly don't want to get the
reputation of losing the layups.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1-6 Colts are probably not a layup.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they are improving, and the last time they played, two
weeks ago, they lost a very tough game to the San Francisco 49ers,
34-31. Before that, the Colts took the Saints to overtime before
losing (19-13), beat the Chargers (17-12), and lost to the Bills
(31-24).
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll's theme in practice all week was ``awareness.'' He
painted this as a dangerous game, the Colts as a dangerous
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are moving the ball like crazy, they're all
excited, they're as healthy as they've been all year,'' said the
New England coach. ``They've had the bye week to prepare and we
haven't played our best football. They can see we've had our
problems and they see it as a great opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a must-win game for us,'' echoed Drew Bledsoe. ``We
have to get back on track and start winning games. If we want to
win our division, we probably have to run the table against the
rest of our divisional opponents.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be difficult. But if the Patriots beat the Colts, they
would be 5-3. Same as last year, when they went 10-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's a comfort level, but there is that
experience that we have where we have responded to adverse
situations,'' said Bledsoe. ``So we know we can do that, but then
we have to realize how we've done that in the past. The way we've
done it is by coming back and going to work, paying attention to
the details, and executing properly on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words probably apply to Bledsoe more than any other
Patriot in regards to last week's 12-9 overtime loss to the
Dolphins. He missed several chances to score when he couldn't hit
open receivers.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Patriots' defense played well, not allowing a
touchdown, they continue to get beat in the secondary. This is
puzzling because the secondary is Carroll's area of expertise. It
isn't simply a case of Chris Canty getting beat; it seems everyone
is playing too soft.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said the Patriots would mix up their looks and try to
confuse rookie quarterback Peyton Manning as they did in Week 2.
Carroll was reluctant to get specific, and when pressed on why the
Patriots aren't playing more aggressive _ bump-and-run has been his
trademark over the years _ he would say only, ``We'll do some of
that. But the best way we feel we can have success is to mix up the
way we play and not get caught up in tendencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Manning, the first overall pick in the draft, leads the AFC in
passing yardage and has reduced his mistakes since throwing three
interceptions in a 29-6 loss in Foxborough Sept. 13. Confusing him
may still be a viable strategy, though the rookie undoubtedly has
learned a lot since Week 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's coming along,'' said Bledsoe. ``Early on he had a lot of
turnovers, but even then he was throwing the ball accurately and
doing a lot of good things. And now the entire level of play has
improved along with him and that's allowed him to make some big
strides.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the Marshall Faulk factor. He has accounted for
45.1 percent of the Colts' offense, an NFL high.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's having a great year,'' said linebacker Todd Collins, whom
the Patriots will use against Faulk in pass coverage, with help
from a safety. ``Whether he has a renewed interest in the game or a
commitment, whatever it is, it shows on the field. We have to watch
him. He's got to be a big focus for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done some things here that are correctable,'' said
Armstrong. ``We're better than what we've showed. We're making
mistakes that we know we can't make. I think we all have to go into
every game from here on out and play it like the good team that we
are.''

RUSSIAN YAGUDIN CONQUERS AMERICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ For a while, after he won the global title in March,
Alexei Yagudin couldn't deal with the idea of being on top of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little bit destroyed,'' the Russian confessed. ``When
you want something for your life and you get it, something changes
inside and you can't stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   What Yagudin concluded, finally, was that he was still only 18
and that he either had to compete or retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, you're nobody again,'' he told himself.
</P>
<P>
   So Yagudin went back to the rink to perfect his jumps and take
his artistry to a new level. And Saturday afternoon in Joe Louis
Arena, the man from St. Petersburg blew away an impressive field to
win the Skate America title, holding off Michael Weiss, former
Olympic gold medalist Alexei Urmanov, and former world champion
Elvis Stojko with a brilliant long program.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Olympic champion Ilya Kulik and former world titlist Todd
Eldredge are wise to sit out the season. Because anybody who wants
to beat Yagudin needs to be in the land of 5.9s. Yagudin earned 10
of them _ five technical, five artistic _ for a long program
(skated to the ``Lawrence of Arabia'' theme) that deftly wedded
grace to aerials.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough to hold off Weiss, who skated the best
long program of his life, nailing two combination jumps and a
triple axel and barely missing a quadruple toe loop en route to
silver.
</P>
<P>
   There was personal satisfaction, too, for Urmanov and Stojko,
who are both coming off nasty groin tears and approached the season
with crossed fingers.
</P>
<P>
   Urmanov, who was out of competition for 16 months after hurting
himself at the 1997 world championships, landed eight triple jumps
to grab the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to work very hard because the other skaters were better
than me,'' said Urmanov. ``But I feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   And Stojko, who hadn't competed since tearing both groin and
abdominal muscles at the Olympics, made it through a demanding long
program that included a double-footed quad and took fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alexei and I know the road and it's hard,'' said Stojko, who
hadn't finished out of the medals since the 1996 world
championships. ``I'm just trying to get back. But I feel good about
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The women, meanwhile, were hoping merely to remain vertical last
night after Friday evening's splatter session in the short program.
Russia's Maria Butyrskaya, who figured she was finished after
crashing on her triple lutz combination, still ended up leading the
rest of the bruised and bedraggled pack, which couldn't have
handled a combo if it came with a side of cornbread.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Bobek, competing in her first important event since she
skittered to a tearful 17th place at the Olympics, came down
asprawl on her relatively easy triple flip combination and was
sitting in fourth.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it was a not-ready-for-prime-time performance that
left the judges scratching their heads. How did you compare one
botched combination to another?
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like a week before everybody wants to do it,'' mused
Richard Callaghan, Bobek's coach.
</P>
<P>
   Ready or not, someone had to win here. Had three-time champion
Michelle Kwan been allowed to defend her title (the International
Skating Union turned thumbs-down because Kwan wouldn't commit to
the Grand Prix circuit), she probably would have won in a walkover.
</P>
<P>
   Without her, Butyrskaya, the 26-year-old world bronze medalist
from Moscow, was the class of the field. All she needed do was keep
her feet in last night's long program to hold off Angela Nikodinov,
the 18-year-old Californian, and fellow Muscovite Elena Sokolova.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Russians, who dominated this year's world event,
were looking to run the table for the first time at Skate America.
Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze, the global champions, took
the pairs crown ahead of Canada's Kristy Sargeant and Kris Wirtz
Saturday afternoon despite a ragged performance that included a
fall by Berezhnaya on a throw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe some mistakes happened today, but we'll skate much, much
better,'' said Sikharulidze. ``Now we are world champions and we
must show you good skating because everybody expects it.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Victoria Maksuta and Vladislav Zhovnirsky climbed out
of fourth to grab the bronze medal from US brother-and-sister entry
Danielle and Steve Hartsell.
</P>
<P>
   Winning last night's dance crown shaped up as more of a
challenge, since Irina Lobacheva and Ilya Averbukh were sitting
second behind France's Marina Anissina and Gwendal Peizerat after
the original dance. Even so, the Russians figured to claim half of
the title since Anissina grew up in Moscow.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Alabama sources say former TCU coach Pat Sullivan's supporters
at Auburn are strong enough to get him an interview for the vacant
head coach's position but whether he's tight enough with
influential trustee Robert Lowder is questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Sullivan is Lowder's ears belong to former
Auburn coach Pat Dye.
</P>
<P>
   Dye has not been a huge Sullivan fan since the two had a falling
out when Sullivan, then quarterbacks coach, was passed over for the
offensive coordinator position while he was on Dye's staff at
Auburn.
</P>
<P>
   Lowder apparently favors giving interim coach Bill Oliver, the
former Bear Bryant aide, the job on a full-time basis. If Oliver
falls flat over the season's final weeks, Plan B is go out and hire
a big name or young, up-and-coming coach.

   The potential list of candidates shows how arrogant the whacky
Alabamans can be: Cowboys' head coach Chan Gailey, retired former
Notre Dame coach-turned studio analyst Lou Holtz, Miami's Butch
Davis, Temple's Bobby Wallace, Idaho's Chris Tormey, Florida
defensive coordinator Bob Stoopes and Tom Tuberville from Ole Miss.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey accidentally set off alarms all over Alabama when he was
on the Auburn campus last weekend to visit his son.

<P>
   The only way Sullivan is likely to wind up there is if Jimbo
Fisher, the current offensive coordinator, also leaves and Sullivan
gets that job as a peace offering to his many supporters.
</P>
<P>
   But why would a new coach want an offensive coordinator whose
sub-title is head coach-in waiting? ...

   Yes, the Mets will raise ticket prices, but that was already in
the works before Piazza signed. And yes, the pressure on manager

   The most heavily booed opposing player in Rangers' history is
about to change uniforms. Teams who have already expressed an
interest in free agent third baseman Robin Ventura, who once made
the mistake of charging the mound against Nolan Ryan to seal his
place alongside Santa Ana in Texas infamy, include the Cubs, Mets,
Padres and _ look out _ Mariners. Ventura, who won his fifth Gold
Glove last week, has yet to hear from the White Sox, however. ...

   Dr. Bobby Brown, former American League president, will deliver
remarks in memory of George Schepps during the annual Texas
Baseball Hall of Fame banquet at the Arlington Convention Center
Thursday night. That crusty old George won't be there to respond in
his usual lengthy fashion should mean a much shorter banquet. Given
the option, we'd still rather have him back. ...

   New Dodgers manager Davey Johnson is already laying down the law
to his players: No facial hair except for mustaches; no earrings or
other visible jewelry while in uniform; no bluejeans or athletic

when the new manager trades his running buddy, Bobby Bonilla. Watch
for that next. ...

   The Yankees have apparently contacted virtually every free agent
player on the block, including Albert Belle, which prompted this
response from one baseball source in the ``New York Daily News'':

million a year, why wouldn't they just give it to Bernie , who
people already like?'' ...

   The Celtics' Kenny Anderson, who pays $75,000 a year to ensure

at great personal sacrifice, decide he only needs seven cars.'' Say
it ain't so, Kenny. ...

   INSIDER OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza hits the lottery jackpot of all-time _ $91 million
over the next seven years _ and he's ``still'' got incentives built
into the deal? You've got to be kidding. He gets another $50,000
for making the All-Star team, winning a Gold Glove or a Silver
Slugger award or being named the NLCS MVP; $100,000 if he's World
Series MVP and $125,000 if he's league MVP, with a sliding scale of
bonuses from finishing first to fifth ($50,000) in the voting.
What, he needed some tip money?
</P>
<P>
   REVO'S RIM SHOTS
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Taylor's agreement to enter a rehab facility after
trying to buy ``crack'' from an undercover police officer takes a
little bit of shine off his ``I was set up,'' defense, doesn't it?
This, the same week that the NFL announces Taylor's name among
nominees for the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Maybe they can hang his
plaque in Cell Block C.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes word the Cardinals may be offering Kevin Brown an
amazing four-year, $53 million contract. Don't know about you but I
can sulk, throw temper tantrums and lose World Series games for a
lot less than that.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan popped out of the room where the NBA labor
negotiations were being held last week and immediately the cameras
went up and the lights came on. ``Hey,'' Jordan protested, ``I'm
just going to use the restroom.'' The surprise is no one asked,
``No. 1 or No. 2?''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees say they're also interested in free agent pitcher
Randy Johnson. Not that he'd notice, but that note alone just cost
Rangers owner Tom Hicks another couple million.

A SETBACK IN COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It was one of the NHL's most uplifting stories: John Cullen's
amazing comeback from cancer and his return to the Tampa Bay
Lightning. Cullen scored the winning goal in the club's first
exhibition game against Buffalo in Innsbruck, Austria, and it
appeared he might be able to pick up where he left off.
</P>
<P>
   But Cullen's road back took a detour last week when he was
assigned to the Cleveland Lumberjacks of the International League.
Cullen was offered an assistant coaching position with the
Lightning, but the 34-year-old felt he wanted to continue playing.
If he returns to the NHL, it apparently will not be with Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Lightning general manager/coach Jacques Demers told reporters he
had offered Cullen to Ottawa, which declined, and that he would
listen to other offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've faxed every team in the league and told them that we'd be
very flexible if they have any interest in having John Cullen on
their team,'' said Demers. ``I'm not trying to bury John Cullen in
the minors. I want him to be in the NHL, but my job as GM is to ice
the best 20 players I can for my team, and right now John is not
one of our best 20 guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want John to have a good chance to make it back to the NHL,
and I hope he does well. But I can't make him any promises even if
we have injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The one promise Cullen has is that the coaching offer remains on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen learned in March 1997 that he had non-Hodgkins lymphoma.
He underwent chemotherapy and radiation before having a successful
bone-marrow transplant a little less than a year ago. Last April,
doctors said he was cancer-free, and the former Boston University
star set his sights on a return to the game he loved.
</P>
<P>
   While his days in the NHL may be over, there is another voice
saying, ``Don't dismiss his chances so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Referee Paul Stewart, who has made a comeback from colon cancer
and is scheduled to return to NHL officiating Nov. 13 after working
several AHL contests, said it's too soon to say Cullen's NHL days
are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people should feel his career is over because he
got sent down or he didn't last,'' said Stewart. ``He and I have
defeated this disease and we've made it back to hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had that one game where he had that emotional splash and he
was running on adrenaline. Now he's going down to work on his
stamina. With his heart and his desire, he'll probably get back. I
think people shouldn't write it off because he got sent down or say
Tampa used it as a publicity stunt.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart soon will return to the NHL, and he believes Cullen can,
too.

   Speculation abounds that this could be  &UR; Wayne Gretzky's  &LR; final
season, but so far Gretzky isn't hinting that it's true. ``People
are always asking me,'' he said. ``My kids ask every day. I
honestly don't know. I do know if I decide to quit, I wOn't tell
anybody until there's about a month to go in the season. I don't
want a farewell tour. That's the only thing my agent,  &UR; Mike
Barnett &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and I disagree about. I've had victory laps for 20
years.'' If you ask those around the Great One, it appears that,
like Bruins captain  &UR; Ray Bourque &LR; , &UR;  &LR; he isn't quite ready for the
retirement life. ``He walked into the practice rink the other day
and said, `Who do I complain to about my ice time? I'm not getting
enough,''' said Rangers coach  &UR; John Muckler &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who also coached
Gretzky in Edmonton. ``I'd just played him 28 minutes on
back-to-back nights. Believe me, he's still having fun. There's
still a smile on his face. He works harder than anyone in
practice.'' ... All is not well in Colorado, where the Avalanche
lost five of their first seven (1-5-1), and one player slumping
badly is three-time Stanley Cup-winning goalie  &UR; Patrick Roy &LR; . ``I
know I can give more to this team,'' said Roy, who had a 3.96 goals
against average and horrid .858 save percentage as of Saturday.
``At the same time, I'm so close. That's probably what frustrates
me most. Every night, I give up three, four, five goals and they're
so close. I go home and say, `Geez, I could've gotten away with a
one-goal game.' I know it's `if, if, if,' but I don't want to give
up. I want to work harder and stay positive. I go out there now and
I feel the puck is as small as a golf ball. Some days, I feel like
it's as big as a beach ball. I guess there are moments like this,
and when you start winning, get some success, I know it's going to
come.'' ... Former Bruin goalie  &UR; Bill Ranford &LR; , &UR;  &LR; now with Tampa
Bay, suffered a scratched cornea in his left eye when the stick of
teammate  &UR; Jassen Cullimore  &LR; went through an opening in the goalie's
facemask as Ducks star  &UR; Paul Kariya  &LR; was trying to finish off a
scoring chance. ``There's only one way it can get in there,'' said
Ranford. ``It fit the angle perfectly. I knew I had gotten hit in
the nose. But when I reached up, I felt blood in my eye. I thought
maybe it sliced the eye or something.'' It turned out, luckily for
Ranford, that the blood was from his nose ... Reports out of Canada
had the Oilers making an offer to former Bruin  &UR; Sheldon
Kennedy &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who recently completed an in-line skate across Canada to
raise funds for sexual abuse victims. But Oilers GM  &UR; Glen Sather
 &LR; said, ``I haven't talked to him and he hasn't called me. Our team
is pretty well set. We just don't have any space at this time. I
don't see that after this much time away that he has much of a
chance to play here. And we have plenty of guys in Hamilton.''
Sather said Kennedy's best chance for a comeback would be to sign
with an IHL club and work his way back into form.

   Both the Flyers and Senators got a hoot out of Philadelphia
forward  &UR; Alexandre Daigle's  &LR; return last week to the city in which
he started his underwhelming pro career _ Ottawa. Daigle, who
somehow seems more at home off the ice than on it, was the subject
of numerous articles in local newspapers chronicling his alleged
brief relationship with actress  &UR; Pamela Anderson Lee &LR; . ``Tell you
one thing,'' said Flyers captain  &UR; Eric Lindros &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who for once
wasn't the center of attention in the media horde. ``I don't think
too many of our guys passed up the chance to read the paper this
morning.'' As much as Daigle has been a source of frustration for
his coaches, he is widely liked by current and former teammates.
``One of the things this team has learned is that you need a
balance over the course of a season,'' said Lindros. ``Alex is one
of those guys who helps keep things light in here because of his
personality.'' Added Senator forward  &UR; Shawn McEachern &LR; , &UR;  &LR; ``If you
knew him, you'd be laughing, too. He's a funny guy. Everybody likes
him.'' ... At the player's request, the Avalanche dealt forward
 &UR; Eric Lacroix &LR; , &UR;  &LR; son of GM  &UR; Pierre Lacroix &LR; , &UR;  &LR; to the Los Angeles
Kings for left wing  &UR; Roman Vopat  &LR; and a sixth-round choice in next
June's draft. The situation in Colorado had become very diffcult
for Lacroix. ``It was best that I leave,'' he said. ``It was a
situation where I'm the son, he's the GM, and it's been like that
since I've been here. And when you're in a slump, when you're
1-5-1, there are going to be distractions. Before this became a
bigger one, I thought it was best I move on.'' Pierre Lacroix said
his son was a victim of circumstance. ``Eric the person had no
problem with anybody,'' said the GM. ``Any player will tell you
that. When I made the trade for him (in June 1996), I was totally
conscious that one day I would have to do something like this.''
... Tough times for Oilers forward  &UR; Doug Weight &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who could be out
for the season after a  &UR; Mark Tinordi  &LR; hit injured his right knee.
Weight injured a ligament and underwent an MRI. The best-case
scenario has him out six weeks. ``It felt like a broken rubber band
in there,'' said Weight ... Turned out that last Saturday night's
Dallas-San Jose matchup was much ado about nothing. The game was
billed as a potential bloodbath because controversial Sharks
defenseman  &UR; Bryan Marchment &LR;  _ best known for being the guy whose
borderline-legal hits knocked out Stars players  &UR; Mike Modano &LR; , &UR; Greg
Adams &LR; , &UR;  &LR; and  &UR; Joe Nieuwendyk  &LR; last season _ was back in town.
Feisty left wing  &UR; Grant Marshall  &LR; was the man who went hunting for
Marchment in the Stars' 2-1 victory. ``Yeah, I kinda was,'' he
said. ``He did a lot of things to our club last season and it was
an emotional night for everybody.'' As for Marchment, he weathered
all kinds of verbal abuse but didn't retaliate. There were more
brawls in the stands than on the ice. It will be interesting to see
what transpires in the next game between the clubs, Wednesday in
San Jose. ``Got 'em back in our barn in four games,'' said
Marchment. ``This was just a good, physical hockey game. Other than
losing, it was fun to play. Their guys were looking for hits and
they were finishing their checks a little more than normal, I
think.'' ... 26 days until the Bruins see the Habs again.

DOYLE LEARNING SENIORS INSIDE-OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM McCABE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He knows going in that the playing field is not even, that the
game is somewhat different.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life,'' said Allen Doyle, ``the score is what mattered.
Now, for a third of the field, it doesn't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   In the world of the Senior PGA Tour, it's not so much what you
can do, it's what you once did. Which is why Doyle is on the
outside, trying to play his way into a very closed shop.
</P>
<P>
   Doyle is battling long odds as he contends for a spot with the
over-50 crowd. He has an unorthodox swing, shaped by many winter
nights of practicing in the cellar of his Norwood home, but the dip
isn't the reason he's up against it; quite the contrary, the swing
rarely fails him. What is making life difficult for Doyle is a set
of rules that doesn't exactly embrace newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   His golf resume is impeccable, but most of the highlights came
while he was an amateur (three Walker Cups, US Amateur
semifinalist, three World Amateur Tournaments), and none of those
line items earned him a penny. So when it comes to the
all-important category of All-Time Money List, Doyle is pushed to
the back of the line. Doesn't matter if there are 30 guys in front
of him who can't break 80; Doyle most likely will be watching the
festivities on TV. Unless he chooses to go to the beach, which is
how he spent last week's EMC Kaanapali Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finished fourth in Sacramento (at the Raley's Gold Rush
Classic) the previous week, and I told them that in Hawaii,'' said
Doyle. ``I asked them to consider me (for a sponsor's exemption)
based on that and they said, `Oh, we will.' But they gave three of
the four spots to locals.''
</P>
<P>
   So Doyle and his wife spent the week on the beaches of Maui.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, it was fun,'' said Doyle, ``and I'm making 10 times
what I would be at the driving range (in LaGrange, Ga.), and
Titleist has been great to me, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   When guys in the field are posting numbers that look like
temperature readings from Phoenix in August, it hurts not to be
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I've played, I've played well,'' said Doyle. ``It's just
that it's tough getting a chance to play.''
</P>
<P>
   When he turned 50 in June, he had hoped to get perhaps five
sponsor's exemptions on the Senior Tour, but only two _ the
BankBoston Classic at Nashawtuc in Concord and the following week
at the Emerald Coast Classic _ have come his way. His other three
starts have come via the brutal Monday qualifying, in which, on
average, 120 tee it up for four spots. Usually, the qualifiers are
on courses you have never seen.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: Last week in Hawaii. Doyle couldn't get a flight
out of San Francisco Sunday night, so he flew out Monday morning
and made his tee time with a half-hour to spare. Twice on the
incoming nine he came to holes where he thought the water was not
in play and both times he was wrong. Those two shots cost him four
penalty strokes and a qualifying spot.
</P>
<P>
   Golf has always been a game of numbers, and for Doyle, those
next to his name for 1998 are quite impressive: five tournaments,
$144,018, 69th on the money list. Of those ahead of him, only Jack
Nicklaus has played in fewer than 18 tournaments. But while Doyle
tends to get shut out of field, others can fall back on past
laurels (Miller Barber has 29 starts, $78,267; Orville Moody has 27
and $53,977; Bobby Nichols has 27 and $50,639; and the most glaring
case of all, Lou Graham has made just $11,736 in 21 starts).
</P>
<P>
   At this weekend's Pacific Bell Classic in Los Angeles, Doyle
made it 4 for 7 in Monday qualifiers (in which he's 20 under). When
he opened with a 2-under 70, it put him 30 under in 15 rounds of
competition. And for all of those red numbers, he gets to think
about Qualifying School in early December at Grenelefe in Haines
City, Fla., where some 110 hopefuls will grind it out for eight
fully-exempt spots on the 1999 Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just go and play,'' said the former Catholic Memorial and
Norwich Academy hockey player, who settled in Georgia after being
stationed at Ft. Gordon after college. The last time he went to
Tour School, he was a 48-year-old battling kids half his age, a pro
for just two years, and he did then what he has often done _ defied
the odds. Doyle was medalist two years ago to earn his second
go-round on the PGA Tour, and though he struggled in 1997 ($66,555,
189th on the list), Doyle was simply biding his time until he
turned 50.
</P>
<P>
   Now that he's there, he has discovered the pay is good; it's the
play that is hard.
</P>
<P>
   ___ &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The PGA of America has turned to Texas guys seven times to coach
its Ryder Cup teams (including the last three _  &UR; Lanny
Wadkins &LR; , &UR; Tom Kite &LR; , &UR; Ben Crenshaw &LR; ). But there apparently is not
the same passion for one of the Lone Star State's premier courses.
</P>
<P>
   When the much-anticipated site for the 2003 Ryder Cup was
announced, folks at Colonial CC in Fort Worth groaned. Having spent
many thousands of dollars to plead their case, club officials were
optimistic that golf's biggest spectacle would land at their
doorstep. Colonial was often mentioned as a front-runner, along
with Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina, Pebble Beach, Hazeltine in
Minnesota, and Medinah outside of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise. The 2003 Ryder Cup was awarded to Oakland Hills CC in
Bloomfield Hills, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's hard to argue with that choice. Oakland Hills provides
a supreme test on a majestic course that is saturated in the
history the golf establishment embraces.  &UR; Ben Hogan  &LR; won the 1951
US Open there and, in doing so, immortalized the layout by calling
it ``a monster.'' It's a  &UR; Donald Ross  &LR; creation on which six US
Opens have been contested, most recently in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, even the folks at Colonial, Pinehurst, Pebble Beach,
Hazeltine, and Medinah would agree that it was a fitting selection.
But what was surprising was the decision to award the 2007 Ryder
Cup to Valhalla in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it shouldn't be a surprise _ not when the PGA of
America owns Valhalla, which hosted the 1996 PGA Championship and
will do so again in 2000 and 2004. That means in a 12-year span,
Valhalla will get four of golf's biggest events. It is a relatively
young course (not yet 20 years old), designed by a guy more highly
regarded as a player than an architect (Nicklaus), one that
features a split personality _ the front is links-style, the back
more traditional with tree-lined fairways.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Colonial and Pinehurst are held in higher regard as
courses, but Valhalla brings to the table some very important
qualities in this era of big-time sporting events: There's tons of
room for corporate tents, TV folks can easily put down their miles
of cables, and moving people in and out will be an orderly task.
And, of course, you make more money if you don't have to share the
revenue.
</P>

   It was announced last week that the late  &UR; Lloyd Mangrum  &LR; is the
newest member of the World Golf Hall of Fame. For those who think
pro golf dates back only to when  &UR; Greg Norman &LR;  came over from
Australia, the name means little, but Mangrum is a memorable
character. His lasting image is that of a  &UR; Clark Gable  &LR; lookalike,
cigarette dangling from his mouth. The story goes that Mangrum was
once scolded by a woman in the gallery during the Masters.
``Athletes shouldn't smoke,'' the woman reportedly said. To which
Mangrum responded: ``I'm no athlete, lady; I'm a golfer.'' Indeed,
Mangrum could play. ``One of the greatest,'' according to  &UR; Jack
Burke Jr. &LR; , a fellow Texan. ``He was a gambler, at cards and golf,
and he was one of the best putters ever on this God's earth.''
Mangrum, who died in 1973 at 59, won the 1946 US Open and four
years later, he and  &UR; George Fazio &LR;  lost in a three-way playoff to
Hogan at Merion ... As you struggle to break 100 and not three-putt
from 12 feet, you may want to take time out and shed a few tears
for  &UR; Vijay Singh &LR;  and the other millionaires teeing it up in the
PGA Tour Championship. Seems Singh was among those complaining that
East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta is playing tough, thanks to fast,
sloping greens and rough that is a bit penalizing. What a shame.
You would think that for a mere $4 million purse, including a
last-place payoff of $64,000, things would be made easy for these
guys ... Certainly, there are struggling pros who wouldn't mind
tackling a tough course if it meant a chance at $720,000 (which is
what the Tour Championship winner gets).  &UR; Kevin Johnson &LR; , for one.
The former State Open and State Amateur champion shot a final-round
74 Friday and failed to advance at the second stage of PGA Tour
Qualifying School. At the Country Club of South Carolina in
Florence, Johnson started the final 18 at 7 under, but missed out
on a playoff that came at 6 under. Among those who did advance were
 &UR; Fran Quinn &LR;  of Northboro and  &UR; Pat Bates &LR; , who grew up in
Manchester; they both came up with clutch 68s to finish 8 and 7
under, respectively.

   He is one of the enduring stories in New England golf, and this
past week saw  &UR; Paul Barkhouse  &LR; add another chapter. Barkhouse shot
74 Thursday to nail down a two-shot win in the New England PGA

TAYLOR HAS TIPPETT'S BACKING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andre Tippett knew the words he was about to speak Friday
morning would not help him get elected to the Pro Football Hall of
Fame, but he said them just the same because, well, what's right is
right, even if it's wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Hall of Fame is about more than just playing,''
said Tippett, one of 76 players listed on the preliminary ballot
for this year's Hall of Fame class. ``It think it's about integrity
and accountability and a lot of things, but unless you change the
rules and put stipulations like baseball and some of the other
sports have and it's in print, it should go as it stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't change the rules because all of a sudden somebody
does something and you want to punish the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy'' is Lawrence Taylor, who is considered by many to be
the greatest linebacker of all-time and perhaps the greatest
defensive player at any position. Taylor accomplished what few
athletes ever do. He changed the way his game was played,
revolutionizing the outside linebacker position with his size and
speed and raw aggressiveness as a pass rusher.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who also was nominated for Hall of Fame induction,
played on teams that won two Super Bowls in the mecca of hype _ New
York City. He became ``LT,'' a legend larger than life. Sadly, he
seems to think that legend can overshadow anything the man who
created it does to besmirch it.
</P>
<P>
   When Taylor was busted Oct. 19, for the third time since he
retired in 1993, for allegedly buying $50 worth of crack cocaine in
Largo, Fla. from an undercover police officer, he cried that he was
set up. Then he went on national television with his lawyer by his
side and made an incoherent fool of himself trying to answer Jim
Nantz's questions.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, Taylor was back in a rehab center and
filing for bankruptcy protection to prevent foreclosure on his home
in Upper Saddle River, N.J. It was another sad chapter in the
history of a man who once rewrote the record books but now is
authoring a tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after Taylor's arrest, the New York media
mill went to work and soon Joe Horrigan, the vice president of the
Hall of Fame, was on record stating that the only criteria for
election were a player's accomplishments on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our rules say that all that matters is what happened on the
field during his playing career,'' Horrigan said. ``You'd hope
that's what everyone would consider, but there is nothing in the
bylaws that says you have to vote for anyone. We don't give out
awards for citizenship, but if someone wants to use that for a
criterion, we can't stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly we wouldn't want to require our athletic heroes to be
good citizens as well, now would we?
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, Tippett pointed out that in his day he had had
several run-ins with the law, centering around assault charges, but
he grew from them. Had Taylor slipped once or twice, then righted
himself, it would not be an issue. But with each passing year it
seems Taylor grows more maladjusted to life without football. Life,
frankly, without being ``LT'' anymore.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Tippett has sympathy for the man whose shadow he had
to live under during their parallel playing careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about an addiction and how tough that is to
overcome,'' Tippett said. ``Here's a guy who had a high tolerance
for pain, who always played as if he was invincible. Because of
that, I think it's hard for him to face reality and ask for
anyone'e help. He may be a guy who has to hit rock bottom before he
can come back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hit the guy when he's down, but I've known enough
people with that sickness. I think we all should be held
accountable for what we do. I have kids now. I've been embarrassed
by some of the things I did in the past but I learned you can't go
on in life and be that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up believing you leave people alone and they leave you
alone but if they mess with you, you hurt them. That was the way I
looked at it for a long time. I look at things differently now.''
</P>
<P>
   Tippett, who worked in player development and counseling for the
Patriots before becoming assistant director of pro scouting last
year, said that until Taylor can see that, his problems will dog
him the way his reputation once dogged Tippett.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor had 132.5 sacks, averaging 10.1 a year between 1981-93.
Tippett had 100 sacks, averaging just over nine a season in his 11
active seasons (he missed 1989 with a torn pectoral muscle). Taylor
had 15 or more sacks four times. Tippett did it twice. At their
best, Taylor had 20.5 sacks in 1986 and Tippett 18.5 in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   It is arguable, however, that Tippett was Taylor's equal, for
much of his success came on teams that were no match for the
Giants' Super Bowl champions. For most of his career, Tippett
labored on teams whose record was bad and off-the-field antics
worse, yet he maintained a level of pride, ferocity, and excellence
the equal of any of his contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   Yet as much as Tippett would love to be a first-ballot Hall of
Famer, he realizes that Michael Haynes, who was as good a
cornerback as anyone who ever strapped on shoulder pads, was not,
and who could account for that?
</P>
<P>
   And so he waits for the 36 men who vote on such matters to
decide his fate and Taylor's. In his heart, Tippett believes he
belongs right next to Taylor when the induction ceremony comes next
August, but he senses that may not happen. He may be surprised to
learn that it may not happen for either of them this time.
</P>
<P>
   The Newark Star Ledger conducted a poll last week on Taylor's
candidacy, contacting nearly all 36 voters. Only 20 were committed
to voting for Taylor, nine short of what he needs.
</P>
<P>
   Five voters said they would not vote for Taylor, with the
remaining undecided. If only three of those undecided votes go
against Taylor, he will be denied his sport's final honor, a rebuff
one voter found no problem supporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize he's sick, but for the NFL to admit him to the
Hall at a time when he could be in jail is not sending a good
message to the nation,'' said San Diego sportswriter Jerry Magee,
whose career goes back to the first days of the AFL. ``I know this
sounds corny, but I find it offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   That view was not shared by longtime Buffalo News columnist
Larry Felser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have enough problems policing my own morals without worrying
about Lawrence Taylor's,'' Felser said. ``If Lawrence Taylor isn't
in the Hall of Fame, what the hell do you have a Hall of Fame for?
He's probably the best defensive player I've ever seen. If you have
to have the warden come and collect the bust for him, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   That could be the case if Taylor isn't diverted into a drug
rehabilitation program, the likes of which he once said he didn't
need because he got all the therapy he needed playing golf.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens to Taylor, Tippett will watch the
proceedings and pick his words carefully if the morning comes when
his children ask him why a three-time loser to crack cocaine was
elected to the Hall of Fame ahead of their father.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens, I'll probably say ... I don't know what I'll
say,'' Tippett said. ``I think I'll say, here was a guy who got
into the league when it didn't have a player like him and
revolutionized the game. He was a great player who made the best of
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then maybe I'll try to explain to them the difference in the
markets we played in and then I'll tell them I respect a lot of the
guys I played against, including LT, but I bow down to nobody I
played against. I'll put my numbers up against anyone. I know what
I did in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't happen on the first ballot, it won't be
life-threatening to me _ or to anyone in the house when I hear
that,'' he added with a chuckle. ``But I made my bones in this
league. I understand what the honor is.''
</P>
<P>
   Tippett also understands that LT deserves that honor on the
first try, regardless of his problems with life after football.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, so does AT.
</P>

<P>
   One sure thing seemed to come out of last week's two-day NFL
owners' meetings in Kansas City: Regardless of whether the next
expansion franchise is awarded to Houston or Los Angeles for the
2002 season, the loser will end up being a relocation site for one
of the current teams facing stadium problems. That includes New
England, Buffalo, and Minnesota, and Denver could be added to that
list because Bronco owner  &UR; Pat Bowlen  &LR; told friends last week that
if a stadium-funding initiative doesn't pass, he will go after the
LA Coliseum plan or sell and go after an expansion team. However,
polls in Colorado have the funding initiative projected to receive
well over 50 percent of the vote ... The owners were greatly
impressed by Hollywood mogul  &UR; Michael Ovitz's  &LR; slick presentation
of his proposed new LA stadium, which he plans to call The
Hacienda. Ovitz told the owners it was imperative that Los Angeles
get an expansion team to build something new around rather than an
existing team looking to move. But, as well-received as Ovitz was,
they could not ignore Houston's plan because, according to one
owner, ``They could go in 60 days.'' Unlike the two competing Los
Angeles plans, Houston's effort not only has political backing but
also a financial plan in place and an approved stadium design. The
forces who plan to refurbish the ancient, historic LA Coliseum are
up against some strong opposition from a group of owners adamant
against returning an NFL franchise to that crime-ridden section of
the city, but their proposal was strong enough to keep them in the
running ...  &UR; Carmen Policy  &LR; couldn't quite work his magic, but he
did end up with a compromise settlement with commissioner  &UR; Paul
Tagliabue  &LR; that will result in Policy's expansion Cleveland Browns
being allowed to interview coaching candidates as soon as the
season ends rather than having to wait until the playoffs are over.
The previous restriction prevented teams from talking to coaches
about changing jobs until their team was eliminated from the
playoffs. Tagliabue said only that he would take the idea under
advisement, but he will acquiesce because he realizes it is unfair
to prevent the Browns from hiring staff until well into January
when the expansion draft is Feb. 9 ... That draft, by the way, will
be held at the Canton Civic Center in Canton, Ohio, and be open to
the public. The Browns will select 30-42 players from a list of 150
(five from each NFL team) ... Policy has been blocked temporarily
from hiring his former San Francisco assistant  &UR; Dwight Clark  &LR; to
run the football operation, but it will happen. Clark is working
without a contract and last week turned down a three-year offer
from San Francisco. But the representative for 49ers owner  &UR; Eddie
DeBartolo &LR;  at the meeting,  &UR; Larry Thrailkill &LR; , &UR;  &LR; said he would not
allow Clark to leave before the end of the season. According to
several witnesses, Thrailkill stood up and said, ``We let Carmen
go. That's enough.'' ... Steelers owner  &UR; Dan Rooney  &LR; is pushing for
a full realignment that would have four four-team divisions in each
conference (with four wild-card teams), but until it is decided
between Houston and LA on who that 32d team will be, it's a moot
point ... Although Houston has the early lead, don't bet against
Los Angeles. Many owners think it is ridiculous for the most
popular sport in the country not to have a team in the second-most
populous city. And the owners want LA for one very big reason: TV
ratings. During the meetings, Tagliabue told the owners that in
1994, Cleveland was first, Houston ninth, and LA 14th in TV ratings
for NFL games. With all three markets vacant of teams in 1997, the
ratings fell to 30th, 23d, and 29th respectively ... It was
reiterated at the meetings that the Browns will not be allowed to
trade the extra draft picks they will be given as compensation for
a coach under contract, such as Green Bay's  &UR; Mike Holmgren &LR;  ... In
an attempt to forge a closer relationship between NFL teams and NFL
Europe, it was decided that the NFL will fund strength and
conditoning coaches for each of the spring league's six teams ...
Patriots owner  &UR; Bob Kraft's  &LR; power continued to grow when Tagliabue
named him co-chairman of the expansion committee, along with
Carolina's  &UR; Jerry Richardson &LR; . This was done by combining the
finance committee chaired by Kraft and the stadium committee that
Richardson heads. Kraft held a similarly powerful post on the
Television Committee that negotiated the recent windfall contract.

   Rams coach  &UR; Dick Vermeil  &LR; is a good guy, but what was he
thinking when he let  &UR; Tony Banks  &LR; start at quarterback last week
after Banks missed the team plane the previous week and didn't show
up for two days? If you wonder how Banks could disappear for two
days, miss a team meeting and practice, and then say when he
finally showed up, ``What's the problem?'' understand this. Banks
scored an 8 on the Wonderlic intelligence test coming out of
college. My daughter has a parakeet who could score 8 by pecking
the page. Vermeil was surprised to be confronted by an angry fan
who slipped into the team's practice facility last week to protest
the decision to fine Banks but not bench him. Vermeil heard the fan
out before explaining his decision ... If defensive coordinator
 &UR; Willie Shaw  &LR; can keep the Raiders playing the way they have been,
he could become one of the hot new head coaching candidates when
the season is over. Shaw came in from New Orleans and has taken the
worst defense in the league and turned it into the best. The
Raiders are allowing 249.6 yards a game; a year ago, they allowed
389.9 yards a game. No team since 1970 has gone from worst to first
in NFL defense in one season ... Speaking of the Raiders, personnel
guru  &UR; Ken Herock  &LR; was asked about the play of rookie corner
 &UR; Charles Woodson  &LR; and had a good measuring stick. ``I had  &UR; Deion
 &LR; ( &UR; Sanders &LR; ) when he was a rookie,'' Herock said. ``Woodson is
playing much better than Deion did as a rookie because he makes the
exciting plays like Deion did but he comes up on the force and hits
people, too. Our two corners (Woodson and Pro Bowler  &UR; Eric
Allen &LR; ) &UR;  &LR; are as good as any two in the league right now.'' ...
Sadly, it seems that old friend and warrior  &UR; Pat Harlow &LR;  finally
succumbed to his chronically bad back. Harlow couldn't take the
pain any more last week and was put on injured reserve for the
year, but sources in Oakland say that not even a successful
operation is likely to get him back on the field. Harlow was asked
this summer why he was coming back this year after last season's
4-12 disaster. Harlow smiled for a minute before saying, ``I
couldn't go out that way.'' Both in Oakland and New England, Harlow
was a powerful blocker and a tough-minded but good-natured man who
came to play every game. Not everyone in the NFL can say that.

   Washington defensive coordinator  &UR; Mike Nolan  &LR; spoke to the
latter point when he conceded last week that his team had quit this
season, in some moments. No kidding? The Redskins are 0-7,
overpaid, undertalented, and are going so bad that even in their
bye week disaster struck when defensive tackle  &UR; Dana Stubblefield
 &LR; hurt his knee, allegedly while walking up stairs at his home. He
will be out 2-4 weeks after undergoing surgery. But the loss of the
multimillion-dollar free agent is the least of head coach  &UR; Norv
Turner's  &LR; problems. Writers in Washington have taken to saying
``NORV'' stands for ``Not One Redskin Victory,'' and once you turn
into a joke, you're halfway out the door. It didn't help that
Turner has again waffled on his choice of quarterbacks. He has gone
from  &UR; Gus Frerotte &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who was benched after one game, to  &UR; Trent
Green &LR; , who was benched after five straight losses, to Frerotte,
who was benched a second time after looking pathetic throwing for
just 17 yards on 26 attempts against Minnesota, back to Green for
Sunday's game against the Giants. ``Obviously we are in a situation
where anything can happen,'' said Turner. On a team that has
already cut two kickers, that's an understatement ... Jacksonville
head coach  &UR; Tom Coughlin  &LR; says the blitzing pressure so many teams
have been putting on the quarterback the last two seasons is now an
irreplaceable component of defensive success in the NFL. ``I think
so much has been built and developed within the schemes to account
for pressure that without it I think you're not going to be
successful,'' Coughlin said. ``Now, in the schemes, which include,
of course, the zone blitz, you don't have to match up and be
individually matched up on the outside in order to put on pressure.
That's the real change.'' ...  &UR; Irving Fryar  &LR; is playing for the
struggling Eagles but he still has a sense of humor. Fryar has yet
to score a touchdown this season, and when asked about it last
week, he told a Philadelphia reporter, ``Your dog has the same
amount of touchdowns as I do.'' ... Look for a big day from
Denver's  &UR; Terrell Davis &LR;  against a Cincinnati defense that is
allowing 179.9 yards rushing a game for the season and 215 yards a
game in the last four weeks. The last time they saw Davis, a year
ago, he gashed the Bengals for the same number of yards _ 215. That
was a career high ... If one thing can get Patriots defensive end
 &UR; Willie McGinest  &LR; feeling healthy again, it should be the thought
of rushing the passer next Sunday against Atlanta. The Falcons are
allowing a sack every 7.7 times they pass the ball ... The
Patriots' popularity has convinced the team to open its first
retail pro shop beyond Foxboro Stadium, at the Square One Mall in
Saugus. It will open next month, and if it is successful, four more
such shops could follow ... In case you're still wondering whether
 &UR; Curtis Martin  &LR; is washed up, he's averaging 96 yards a game. He's
rushed for 576 yards in six games. Add to that his 192 receiving
yards, and he has given the Jets 128 yards a game.

MOUNSEY ADDS TOUCH OF GOLD TO BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PROVIDENCE _ Tara Mounsey is a sophomore at Brown University.
Unlike most college sophomores, whose accomplishments and fame and
perhaps glory and celebrity are in front of them, Tara Mounsey
already has climbed a pinnacle of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I was thinking when I first saw Tara,'' said
Carolan Norris, Brown's field hockey coach. ``How do you go from
the (ice hockey) gold medal in Nagano to Brown field hockey, let
alone reality?''
</P>
<P>
   This is fascinating, such success so early. World fame, then
onward with life. It would be an adjustment for one twice Mounsey's
age, but she sees no adjustment, not much out of the ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about playing in front of people,'' said Mounsey, who
played on the Olympic hockey world stage eight months ago and now
plays before a relative few. ``It's just about playing, and doing
well for yourself and your team. So, in a way, it's the same thing
as playing in Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mounsey, mind you, is talking about playing field hockey on the
roof of a gymnasium on the East Side of Providence _ saying it's
``the same thing'' as playing ice hockey under relentless pressure
and before a world audience. That attitude is at the core of why
those who know her at Brown say only the best things about Mounsey.
</P>
<P>
   She now relishes the anonymity of field hockey _ playing on a
team that is 5-7 _ but that season ends next Saturday at Harvard,
and then Mounsey will take only a breath or two before beginning
practice for the sport she most loves, ice hockey. But eight months
ago, in Nagano, Japan, Mounsey and her United States teammates
accomplished a stunning and ultimate goal, a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is a thing that will last forever,'' said Mounsey.
``It's a time, the moment in my life that I will never forget. I
reflect on Japan and I think of the goals, and the team camaraderie
and the motivational things.''
</P>
<P>
   And sports is at the center of it all. True, her goal is to
become an orthopedic surgeon and, as she bluntly puts it, ``Having
a gold medal doesn't help you too much in physics class,'' but she
has been to the top of the mountain. Already.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what the most vivid aftereffect of Nagano has been,
Mounsey said, ``I think that is something that has evolved the
most, my respect for the country. And every time I hear the
national anthem, my eyes sort of well up a little bit. That is one
way to remember everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Nagano and the gold and the moment it all melded together
for the US hockey team, ``you heard it so much, it was just like
part of life. Before you play the game, they play the national
anthem.''
</P>
<P>
   But now?
</P>
<P>
   ``Automatically, said Mounsey, ``I now think back to Japan. The
national anthem was kind of like the closing to everything that
happened in Japan. Weird, you always heard the national anthem at
the beginning, and now it seems like it's a beginning to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   And now? Field hockey?
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy field hockey,'' said Mounsey, who took last year off
from school to play for the US team. ``After Nov. 7, I'll get on
the ice, but I think field hockey has been important in my life in
terms of getting back into school and gives me a little structure
for my fall. I enjoy the team and I've met a lot of great people.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach and player connect
</P>
<P>
   They are up on the roof. Coach Norris calls this the ultimate
home field advantage in American field hockey, playing your games
on Warner Roof atop a sports activities center. It is ... well,
unique.
</P>
<P>
   But the Brown field hockey team also practices up there on the
roof, above it all. And on this late fall afternoon, with darkness
falling very quickly, it is very windy and very cold on Warner
Roof, much windier and much colder, it seems, than on the ground
four stories below. And all the other Brown players have their
sweatpants on, but not Tara Mounsey. She is in her athletic shorts.
</P>
<P>
   No surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Norris knew that Mounsey would be a competitor and would be
tough; after all, the coach had watched with millions of Americans
how Mounsey played for the US gold medal hockey team eight months
ago. It was true mental toughness, as well as talent, that enabled
the US team to surmount its arch-nemesis, Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days before our preseason began,'' Norris recalled, ``I
get a phone call. It was Tara. Now, I'd never met her and I'd only
followed her in her ice hockey. I knew she was coming to Brown, but
I remember thinking I wasn't going to go after her. I thought about
it a lot. I said, `If the kid wants to play, let her come to me.' I
was thinking that after the Olympics, maybe she just needed some
time off just to be Tara.''
</P>
<P>
   So Mounsey made that first phone call. And, according to Norris,
she said ``Coach Norris, this is Tara Mounsey and I was wondering
if I could come out for the field hockey team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, no one calls me, `Coach,' they call me, `Carolan,''' said
Morris. ``And I say, `Is this really you, Tara?' I thought it was
one of my friends kidding me.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was indeed Tara Mounsey.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she told me she was a little concerned about fitting in
sports with school, that she was just getting back into the swing
of things from the Olympics and that she hadn't played (field
hockey) in a couple of years,'' said Norris. ``I said to myself,
`Wow! I can have Tara Mounsey in my program.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, consider this. Norris is from that old-fashioned school of
coaches, a daughter of longtime University of Rhode Island baseball
coach John Norris, a coach who most relates to players like
herself, players who play because they love to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college athletics now, we do so much patchwork, a lot of
the players bring so much emotional stuff,'' said Norris. ``But
there is never any agenda with Tara; she just wants to play for the
pure love of the sport. And, in this day and age, you don't get
that with kids. They say, `What are you going to do for me? How
much (financial aid) are you going to give me? Do I get a free pair
of sneakers?'
</P>
<P>
   ``Tara's never asked for one thing. All she asked for was to be
part of the program. It's had an amazing effect on me. I've been
coaching for years and it's rejuvenated me.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris was a force on the University of Connecticut team that
won the 1981 NCAA field hockey championship. While Princeton and
other schools recruit from the Netherlands _ where field hockey is
almost as much a national passion as tulips _ UConn was a
blue-collar team, with players from New England. And Norris was as
blue-collar as any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute I saw her walk through the parking lot before that
first practice, I said, `There's Tara,''' said Norris. ``She has a
presence about her. Those shoulders. She looks like a swimmer.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris was intent on treating Mounsey like any other player
(``I'm trying not to be impressed that I have an Olympian with
us''), so she wouldn't ask to see Mounsey's gold medal ``even
though my assistants, of course, had no problem with that. They
asked to see Tara's medal.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris has been at Brown for 16 years, also coaching lacrosse
before this season, and she knows athletes. She can go into detail
on a Mounsey goal against URI, recounting every move, calling it
``the best goal I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Then she added, ``When I think of what makes Tara different from
other kids I've coached in the 16 years, she's the best athlete
I've ever coached at Brown. Without a doubt. She has an innate
ability to score, and in field hockey, that's a gift. She's 10
times better than I thought she would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Off the field _ er, roof _ Mounsey is just as respected, said
the coach. Mounsey goes out of her way ``to warm up with some of
the weaker players on the team,'' and, most of all, ``she's so
modest, the most modest player I've ever had. It's almost like I'm
looking for a fault in Tara, and I can't find any.''
</P>
<P>
   A teammate or two, especially Robin Nelson, may josh with
Mounsey, calling her, ``Nagano.'' Nelson teases her by saying,
``Hey, Nagano, what makes you so special?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It lightens up everything,'' said Norris. ``The first couple
of times Robin said that, we all looked to see how Tara would
react. She just laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what field hockey has allowed her to be, not always
having to be the Olympian, not always having to be every thing,
every day, every second.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sides of her
</P>
<P>
   On the bus ride back to Providence from a game at Princeton,
several teammates were asking Mounsey about the Olympics. Then, out
of the blue, recalled Norris, ``She asked me if I had any
collections, if I collected anything. It was the weirdest question
from her. You know, all people talk to her about is sports.''
</P>
<P>
   As the bus rolled on, Mounsey told her coach that she had a rock
collection, ``and we all started laughing and she said, `No, I'm
serious. I collect pet rocks.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was a first. Mounsey has been asked hundreds, if not
thousands, of times about playing on the boys' hockey team in high
school in Concord, N.H. _ not to mention being named the New
Hampshire hockey player of the year, boy or girl _ and she has been
asked question after question about ice hockey. But, said Norris,
``There is so much more to her than sports.''
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics, though, must linger.
</P>
<P>
   ``What stands out in my mind the most,'' said Mounsey, ``was the
last 12 seconds in that game (against Canada) when we were up, 3-1,
and there was no way for them to score two goals, either to tie it,
or three goals to win the game. And it was a time when I happened
to be on the ice and we could enjoy it and know we'd won the goal
medal. Clearly knowing you won, that was such the best feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   The only bummer from the Olympics was that she and her four
teammates who were still collegians could not be included on the
team photo that lit up Wheaties boxes because time moved too fast
to get a waiver from the NCAA. Mounsey, in fact, was so upset that
when the picture was taken, ``I had to leave and go outside. I
couldn't watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   She intends to be on the US team that plays in Salt Lake City in
2002. One of her short-term goals is to see that Brown's field
hockey team finishes with a winning record, which can still happen
(they play at Cornell Sunday, then finish against Fairfield and
Harvard).
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' said Norris, ``Tara has never been on a losing
team in her life.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, while ``ice hockey has always been my favorite
sport,'' said Mounsey, ``that's not to say I don't love playing
field hockey now and I won't enjoy playing softball in the
spring.''
</P>
<P>
   An athlete, yes, a hockey player most of all, but truly Tara
Mounsey is a competitor.

CHAIN REACTION: SERIES OF DOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Players never understand the way it works around
Boston, and neither do most coaches, especially ones born and bred
in, as Charles Emerson Winchester would say (his nose crinkled and
his eyebrows arched), Califorrrrnia.
</P>
<P>
   The players come, the players go. The coaches come, the coaches
go. The owners come, the owners go. But the essentially bumbling
entity known as the New England Patriots remains. Until further
notice, fans and media have every right to remain skeptical, if not
downright cynical, about the team and the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Pop quiz: When was that Kansas City victory anyway? Five years
ago? Twenty-five years ago? Or did it really happen at all?
</P>
<P>
   But that's the single biggest fact of life concerning the
Patriots _ the good times seldom last.
</P>
<P>
   It is truly amazing. When you examine the history of this
franchise, you are struck by the fact that there has never really
been a truly good era. There have only been aberrant bursts of
excellence interspersed with the far more predictable stretches of
incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   It is always wise to enjoy as much as possible the good seasons,
the good games, and perhaps even the good plays. For as surely as
Javert will stalk Jean Valjean, the bad times for the Patriots will
be in hot pursuit of the good ones. And history teaches us that the
bad times will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   There have been three periods of brief success during the past
three decades. The first two quickly ended in chaos.
</P>
<P>
   The 1976 Patriots were 11-3 and quite possibly the best team in
football that year. Then came the outrageous heist in Oakland.
Within two years, Chuck Fairbanks and Billy Sullivan were engaged
in a ludicrous burlesque skit, and by 1981 the team was in a 2-14
sewer.
</P>
<P>
   The 1985 team shocked the football world by becoming the first,
and thus far only, team to reach the Super Bowl by winning three
road games. Once there, the team embarrassed itself beyond measure,
losing to the Chicago Bears by a 46-10 score that felt more like a
1,046-10 game.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did not win another playoff game for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Bill Parcells-led Patriots got to the Super
Bowl, and this time the game was far more competitive. The Patriots
definitely belonged on the same field as the Green Bay Packers.
Fine. But the experience was marred by the question of Parcells's
future, and don't let anyone tell you it wasn't. Parcells's
personal situation was The Story in New Orleans that week. I will
always believe he was not himself during that period, and I'm not
alone. In the finest Patriots tradition, something good was almost
immediately overshadowed by something bad. Parcells was gone within
days, and it was difficult to remember that anything good had
happened at all.
</P>
<P>
   In his quest to find the anti-Parcells, owner Bob Kraft fell in
love with Pete Carroll, bestowing upon him a five-year contract
despite the fact that Carroll's only head coaching job had ended
amid great controversy.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard the following a million times, but there's no harm
in making it 1,000,001. Not every lieutenant is capable of being a
general. There is no disgrace involved, although it is a blow to
the ego when one confronts that blunt reality. Carroll has now
coached the Patriots for nine exhibitions, 23 regular-season games,
and one playoff game, and let's just say there is more evidence to
suggest he is a better lieutenant than he is a general.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just a matter of comparing him with Parcells. Parcells
is a larger-than-life coaching personality. He is an extremely
obvious type. The man was born to lead. He is smart and forceful,
and he is comfortable being a bully. The phrase ``self-doubt'' is
merely an abstract to him. There are successful coaches in the NFL
who aren't Bill Parcells. Mike Holmgren, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The owner wasn't the only one who wanted to distance himself
from Parcells. A lot of the players decided they needed a gentler,
kinder approach. Central casting delivered Pete Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has a tremendous handicap to overcome if he is to become
a successful NFL coach. By outward appearances, he is something of
a normal human being. You can imagine him being your next door
neighbor. You can even imagine him speaking to you and offering to
play catch with your kid. Not for half a second can I imagine
Parcells as a next door neighbor. I can't even picture him living
in a house. I see him in a suite. (Oops, I said I wouldn't keep
comparing Carroll with the Tuna.)
</P>
<P>
   The successful NFL coaches have an edge of some sort. (Have you
ever taken a close look at Mike Shanahan? He could be best buddies
with Freddy Krueger.) Normal is not good. Nice is not good. When it
comes time to assess the correlation between essential kindness and
success as an NFL coach, put me down with the Durocherians.
</P>
<P>
   Now, this may not be panic time _ yet _ but the Patriots are in
some trouble as they prepare for Sunday's game with the Colts. They
have kicked away two games in a row, and I don't see that Carroll
has the proper sense of urgency. And when you combine his gentle
manner with Drew Bledsoe's laconic personality, it's a frightening
mix. The two most important people in the equation are likely to be
droning on about ``lack of execution'' if Peyton Manning &AMP; Co.
defeat them Sunday, and that is not what we want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   And should the team huff and puff its way past the Colts, we'll
be hearing about how ``any win on the road in this league is a big
deal.'' What we'll want to hear is an admission that, yeah, we're
supposed to beat this team, and we probably shouldn't talk until we
beat a really good team on the road. I can tell you right now we
won't hear that, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots simply do not inspire confidence. But why should
they? They are, after all, the Patriots. We know them far better
than they know themselves.

YOUNG, FAVRE SHOWDOWN UNIQUE IN ERA OF ALSO-RANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's probably a figment of our imaginations, a distortion of our
memories, a blind spot on our brains best explained by the
psychological need to long for ``the good old days.''
</P>
<P>
   But doesn't it seem like the NFL used to be a quarterback's
league?
</P>
<P>
   A quick peek under center in today's NFL uncovers a motley
assortment of Zeiers and Tollivers and Frerottes and Hollases, who,
in some cases, are putting up numbers but who under no
circumstances seem destined to uphold the tradition of their
legendary predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   By no means intending to disparage last week's adventurous
Tolliver-vs.-Dilfer duel or today's Green-vs.-Kannell clash, but
classic quarterback matchups happen so rarely in the NFL that
special attention must be paid to special pairings.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to Green Bay vs. San Francisco, the NFL's
marquee game of the day, maybe the NFC's marquee game of the year,
a contest featuring two teams that between them have played in
seven of the eight NFC Championship games this decade.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco is 6-1, nothing outstanding by the 49ers' lofty
standards. Green Bay is 5-2, subpar according to the Packers' usual
accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   But what this game is really about is Favre vs. Young, and the
increasingly rare opportunity to watch future Hall of Fame
quarterbacks from both teams in one game.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, Favre (196) and Young (162) are the top touchdown
producers in the NFL. They've also combined to win the past six NFL
passing titles; Young earned the crowns from 1992-94, and Favre for
the three seasons since, each time earning league MVP honors.
</P>
<P>
   Says Favre: ``Every time I play Steve Young, I'm scared he's
going to do something great.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Young: ``Brett is absolutely everything you could ever want
in a quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   We get Beethoven and Sinatra jamming together, Michaelangelo and
Picasso sharing a palette, Rockefeller and Bill Gates opening up a
joint account.
</P>
<P>
   Both coaches spent the week leading up to the game poor-mouthing
their own quarterbacks while praising the opponents'. Green Bay's
Mike Holmgren, Young's former coordinator in San Francisco, says
Young ``is the best in the game right now.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Steve Mariucci, Favre's former position coach in
Green Bay, says Favre is ``a special playmaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmgren and Mariucci are inclined to say good things about the
other program. Holmgren grew up in San Francisco and tutored Young
when both worked for the 49ers. He employed Mariucci as Green Bay's
quarterbacks coach from 1992-95.
</P>
<P>
   When in Green Bay, Mariucci used to hire Favre to babysit his
kids, and as a child himself, the 49ers coach won a Punt, Pass &AMP;
Kick competition and cherished his prize, a Packers jacket.
</P>
<P>
   But the warm and fuzzy stuff is reserved for before and after
the game. In between, the Packers (5-2) need a victory to avoid
losing more ground in the NFC Central to the Minnesota Vikings
(7-0). The 49ers (6-1) need the victory and the confidence boost
that would come with toppling an opponent that has ended their
season each of the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all worked so closely together,'' Holmgren said of the
ties that bond the 49ers and Packers and serve as the foundation
for two future Hall of Fame quarterbacks. ``But when the game
starts, \RMariucci's\S mind will be so involved in the gameplan and
calling the plays, just like mine will be, that he won't have time
to think about anything but that.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Favre: ``When we line up against each other, we're not
friends. Afterward, we'll shake hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody should take a snapshot of the Young-Favre handshake. In
this NFL, with its drought of great quarterbacks, that's a Kodak
moment.

MISSOURI ESCAPES TEXAS TECH RALLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ The day began with a cheery announcement from
the U.S. Weather Service that the lightning crackling around Jones
Stadium was now ``cloud to cloud'' and could be expected to cease
momentarily.
</P>
<P>
   And that in the interests of prudence, the start of the
Missouri-Texas Tech game would be delayed 38 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Red Raiders (6-3, 3-3 Big 12) possibly missed
a wonderful opportunity to quietly disappear into the gloom.
</P>
<P>
   But they were still there three hours later, gamely battling the
18th-ranked Tigers and a remarkable run of ill fortune in front of
41,378 drenched fans. With 1:05 remaining, a two-point conversion
attempt failed, and Missouri (6-2, 4-1) escaped with a 28-26
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When was the last time I went through something like this?''
Tech coach Spike Dykes said. ``Must've been Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   To which he added, ``But I told these guys that I just really
feel good about us coming back that way, because with everything
that happened, it was amazing we were still there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. The Raiders lost three fumbles, had two touchdowns
called back, and had a punt blocked. They lost their starting
quarterback, two best running backs, and top receiver.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers drove a total of 96 yards for three touchdowns and
scored a fourth on a fumble return. Tech had 429 yards and twice
settled for field goals from inside the Missouri 10. The Tigers got
244 yards and remained upright in the Big 12 race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Dykes said, ``you preach and preach about not
giving the ball away ... but we hurt ourselves today.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, at the end, the Raiders spent nearly six minutes marching
81 yards with backup quarterback Matt Tittle, who threw an
eight-yard, fourth-down scoring pass to Kyle Allamon with 1:05 left
to pull within two. Allamon caught the ball at the 3 and dove past
a Missouri defender into the end zone _ conjuring up the
possibility that Tech, finally, could do anything it pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we would,'' said Allamon, who had the first two
touchdown catches of his career. ``We all thought we would make the
\Rtwo-point\S conversion, and then win in overtime. We just knew
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tittle, pressured, threw his pass for Cole Roberts into the
ground. Missouri covered the onsides kick, and it was finally over.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, quarterback Rob Peters (bruised chest), receiver
Donnie Hart (ankle injury) and running backs Ricky Williams (ankle)
and Ricky Hunter (thigh) were sitting on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   When the Tigers moved, they did it mostly with Devin West (23
carries, 133 yards), who snapped a string of 12 games in which Tech
had not allowed an opposing back more than 100 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   But the key was the Missouri defense, which launched one scoring
drive with a fumble recovery at the Tech 29, another by recovering
a fumbled snap at the 20, and got a third when tackle Terrell
Jurineack rumbled 17 yards with a Peters fumble.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers led, 21-6, at the half and seemingly put it away in
the third quarter when they drove 20 yards to a 28-12 lead and then
stopped Tech cold after the Raiders had recovered a fumble at the
Missouri 40.
</P>
<P>
   But Peters drove the Raiders 61 yards to a score and two-point
conversion, cutting the deficit to eight, before departing. Tittle
and Hunter (25 carries, 121 yards) then keyed the final drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, our defense made one final play,'' Missouri coach
Larry Smith said. ``We won the game because of that one stinking
play on the two-point conversion.''

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Cowboys cornerback Kevin Smith knows what's
being said about him. He has heard the jokes on the radio and has a
bushel full of nasty e-mails and letters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Smith, admittedly in a slump on the field, refuses to walk
around in a funk off of it.
</P>

   He walks the hallways at Valley Ranch with his head high and a
smile on his face. He still listens to the radio. And he hasn't
unplugged his phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough to listen to some of the criticism,'' said
Smith, a seven-year veteran. ``But I'm not going to worry about it.
Besides, it's all part of the game. I've been playing this position
for a long time and have had some good times and some bad times.
People have to say what they have to say. I understand. But I'm not
satisfied. I know I have to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Routinely targeted by opposing quarterbacks looking to make big
plays, Smith has been burned for five touchdown passes and flagged
for three pass interference penalties this season.
</P>
<P>
   During the bye week the Cowboys toyed with the idea of replacing
Smith, 28, with backup Kevin Mathis. Coach Chan Gailey decided
against it and will start Smith when the Cowboys visit the
Philadelphia Eagles tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   Though he doesn't let the criticism bother him, Smith does care
about his slumping play. The former Texas A&AMP;M star, who blew off
some steam in a Las Vegas casino during the bye week, said the
Cowboys' bid for a solid second half of the season hinges on his
improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is for me to bounce back and recover
for the second half,'' Smith said. ``We got a lot of football left.
If I play better, then we do a whole lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith has drawn support from teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Michael Irvin blames the offense for the grief Smith
took after the 13-12 loss to the Bears, who completed seven passes
_ including a touchdown pass _ against Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense gave up 13 points,'' Irvin said. ``If the offense
does its job, \RSmith\S is not a story.''
</P>
<P>
   Star cornerback Deion Sanders said Smith is being ``scrutinized
way too much. He can't win right now and that's sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders understands quarterbacks go after Smith because they are
afraid to throw on him. However, he said the bottom line is how the
entire pass defense does.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't catch any more balls on Smith than they catch on
any other corner in the league,'' Sanders said. ``As a team
defensively, we don't give up more balls as a secondary than
anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Eagles quarterback Rodney Peete chimed in with support,
calling Smith a good player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who said that, Rodney Peete?'' Smith queried. ``He's my
friend. He's going to say something nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith appreciates the kind words. However, he refuses to make
excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is for us to win games and for me
personally to play better,'' Smith said. ``There's no ifs, ands or
buts about it. I got to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   What's most puzzling to Smith and the Cowboys is how he reached
this point.
</P>
<P>
   After being drafted in the first round of the 1992 draft, Smith
became a staple in the Cowboys' secondary on the 1992 and 1993
championship teams. He covered opponents' toughest receivers and
earned a reputation for putting the clamps on San Francisco 49ers
star Jerry Rice.
</P>
<P>
   He missed the 1995 season with a ruptured right Achilles tendon.
However, he bounced back in 1996. Despite the presence of Sanders,
Smith led the team with five interceptions and 18 passes defended.
</P>
<P>
   Things have gone downhill the past two seasons. Smith has only
one interception in the past 27 games, none in the past 19.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern that Smith has lost a step since his tendon
injury. Smith said he's healthy and still runs the 40-yard dash
under 4.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey says his cornerback's problems are mental, that a big
play or an interception can turn things around for Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I think it is,'' Gailey said. ``If he takes a pass
and runs it back, you might see a different guy totally. To me
that's what it is. I don't see it being physical at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys said they will no longer alter their defense to
protect Smith and plan to let him play through this slump.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who admits he finds himself thinking too much, said he
will try to be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to switch a few things up but not a whole lot,''
Smith said. ``The key for me is to attack the ball throughout the
game and concentrate on making plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Until he does, Smith knows he will continue to be targeted _
even by his friend Peete tomorrow night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't matter if it's Peete or John Elway,'' Smith said.
``The object is for me to play better, and I plan on playing
better. Hopefully things will work out.''

MOVING BURE WOULD HELP CANUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rumors swirled this week that the Vancouver Canucks were
interested in working a possible deal of holdout winger Pavel Bure
for Colorado Avalanche center Joe Sakic. While the logistics
(Sakic's $2 million salary and Bure's $8 million per) don't make
sense, the Canucks are on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything, the Canucks need a No. 1 center to take
pressure off Mark Messier. The $6 million man, who scored his 600th
NHL goal a week ago, has shown that he can help lead the Canucks to
the playoffs this season. But the problem is that at age 38,
Messier can't continue to play in all phases of the game and hope
to have anything left in April.
</P>
<P>
   While Messier is off to a sizzling start with four goals and 11
points in nine games, it's doubtful he can keep up the pace if he
is complemented at center by Peter Zezel, Bill Muckalt and Dave
Scatchard. One of Messier's few faults is he plays the game at one
speed _ full tilt _ and that can wear a guy down.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bassen was the same way, and his body won't allow him to
continue at that pace as he sits out with a knee injury in Calgary.
Greg Adams also played tougher than his body allowed and made
several visits to the injured reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Messier always has amazed onlookers, who were stunned by his
feats of endurance. Last season, however, he started to show his
age. So instead of gambling on another miracle, the Canucks need to
get some help for Messier _ and quick.
</P>
<P>
   Because when Messier is at his best, he is something to behold;
he's the kind of player that can lift a team high above its
expected potential.
</P>
<P>
   His 600th goal verifies that. Messier is only the 10th player in
league history to reach that mark and already has surpassed former
teammate Jari Kurri for ninth on the list. What's more, Messier
started his career as a mucker. He had 12 goals in his first season
with the Edmonton Oilers and 23 in his second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I basically had to develop my skills at the professional
level,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has done just that, winning six Stanley Cups (five with the
Oilers and one with the New York Rangers) and ranking second
all-time in playoff goals with 106. His good friend and former
Oilers teammate Wayne Gretzky is the all-time leader with a very
catchable 112.
</P>
<P>
   But that's only if the Canucks make the playoffs, and only if
Messier has any gas left in the tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a class act and the best leader I've ever seen,''
Vancouver goaltender Garth Snow said, echoing the thoughts of a
young Canucks team yearning to be led by hockey's messiah.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Canucks coach and Messier friend Mike Keenan
was lobbying so hard last week for Vancouver general manager Brian
Burke to unload Bure and turn him into an asset for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing \Ron offense\S past the first line until we
make a Bure move,'' Keenan said. ``We have no depth.''
</P>
<P>
   When the trade does finally come, expect a center in return. ...
and then expect a return to greatness for Messier.
SLAP SHOTS
Case study?
</P>
<P>
   Not that it could happen here, but Avalanche winger Eric Lacroix
last week asked for a trade and received one, going to the Los
Angeles Kings for Roman Vopat and a 1999 sixth-round draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   Lacroix is the son of Avalanche general manager Pierre Lacroix,
and rumors out of Denver said some players were uncomfortable that
someone so close to the GM was in the locker room during times of
dissension.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't sad about leaving,''
Lacroix said. ``But I'm also happy that I'm able to go someplace
where I won't be the distraction everybody outside the team
apparently thinks I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gainey, the son of Stars GM Bob Gainey, was the Stars'
third-round pick in 1997. Within the next three seasons, he's
expected to get his chance to play on his dad's team.
Staying dry
</P>
<P>
   Recovering alcoholic Ken Daneyko of the Devils is celebrating
his one-year anniversary of sobriety. He said he carries an article
by the late Mickey Mantle to get him through the tough times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd take it out every couple of months and say, `Gee, that
sounds like me,''' Daneyko said. ``I wasn't an everyday drinker
then, but I knew I would be when I quit. I also read where Mickey
said he wasn't close to his family because of his drinking. That
was me, too.''
Coming back
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon Kennedy, who shocked Canada by helping put former junior
coach Graham James in jail in a ballyhooed sexual abuse case, said
he would like to return to the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, who last month completed an in-line skating trip across
Canada to help raise money for a proposed ranch to help abused
children, didn't play last season after a car accident. He's
currently skating with the Canadian National Team.
He said it
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's forget the euphemisms, the hard noses, the 110 percents
and all the claptrack that surrounds \RBryan\S Marchment and tell
the truth. He's an assassin, a bushwacker. ... Teammates
embarrassed by his actions will say he's great to have on their
team. Of course, they don't have to worry about him crushing their
knees.''
</P>
<P>

Free Press''.
THE BUZZ
Western Conference
</P>
<P>
   The Kings continue to have problems in goal. On the same night
he returned from an injury, Stephane Fiset was hurt in a collision
and reinjured his groin. Jamie Storr (groin) is listed as week to
week. The Stars could see rookie sensation Manny Legace when they
travel to LA on Saturday. ... Just curious, but do you think
they'll make a big deal that Patrick Roy wasn't in net when the
Avalanche beat the Sharks, 4-2, on Thursday. The struggling Roy had
a 3.96 goals-against average and .858 save percentage through six
starts. ... Oilers winger Bill Guerin has eight goals through eight
games and says getting out of the Devils' stifling system (he was
traded last season for Jason Arnott) is the reason for his
improvement. ... The Sharks selected Owen Nolan as their captain
after going without one for half a year (Todd Gill was traded March
24). Alternate captains are: Stephane Matteau, Mike Ricci, Jeff
Friesen, and yes, Bryan Marchment. ... Paul Coffey hasn't even
played a game yet after signing with the Blackhawks in the summer.
The all-time leader in scoring for defensemen with 1,473 points,
the 37-year-old Coffey is out with a pinched nerve. He has averaged
57 games played (out of 82) over the previous two seasons. ... In
his place, the Blackhawks might have assembled the best group of
young defensemen in the NHL. The Hawks acquired Jamie Allison from
Calgary last week to add to the group of Remi Royer, Christian
Laflamme and Alain Nasreddine ... Avalanche defenseman Adam Foote
told ``The Denver Post'' that if the Avs don't redo his $1.1
million contract soon, he might not be back next season. The Avs
picked up young D-man Greg deVries to help stop the bleeding. ...
Update on Marty McSorley's successful return to gooning it up in
Edmonton: dislocated his shoulder on a hit by the Avs' Claude
Lemieux and is expected to be out six weeks.
Eastern Conference
</P>
<P>
   The best goalie in the NHL? Of course, a former Stars backup who
couldn't find a job until late in the summer. Arturs Irbe is 3-1-2
with an 0.87 GAA and a .964 save percentage and appears to have
taken the Carolina Hurricanes' No. 1 goalie spot from Trevor Kidd.
... Bruins center Jason Allison, who missed all of training camp
without a contract, already is back in form with nine points in the
first nine games. ... The Capitals, desperate because of injuries,
signed forward Andrei Nikolishin to a two-year deal for $1.9
million. ... Islanders GM Mike Milbury flew all the way to Vienna,
Austria, to try to get winger Ziggy Palffy under contract. He
failed, so look for the Isles to start trade talks. The Sabres say
they are interested. ... The problem with injury-prone players is
they're prone to being injured. Canadiens center Saku Koivu has an
abdominal strain this time, his third significant injury the past
three seasons. ... Lightning winger John Cullen, attempting a
comeback after bone-marrow transplant to treat cancer, has been
assigned to Cleveland of the International Hockey League. He chose
the Cleveland assignment over an offer to become an assistant coach
with the Lightning. ``It's been tough,'' Cullen said. ``Overall,
I've been a guy that's known he's going to be in the line up most
nights. Now this year, it's different. It's hard.''... The Rangers'
Wayne Gretzky said he isn't telling anyone when he decides to
retire. ``My kids ask every day. I do know if I decide to quit, I
won't tell anybody until there's about a month to go in the season.
I don't want a farewell tour. I've had victory laps for 20
years.''... Penguins' agitator Darius Kasparaitis said he isn't
worried about the people he's hacked off targeting his recently
injured knee. ``My whole body is a bull's-eye,'' Kasparaitis said.
... Canadiens defenseman Dave Manson was suspended three games for
elbowing the Bruins' P.J. Axelsson in the head. Manson also
received a five-minute major penalty and the Bruins scored three
times on that power play en route to a 9-2 win. Ouch.
The week ahead
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: Flyers at Penguins _ a great rivalry game between two
competitive teams and watched by at least 4,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: Stars at Sharks _ Ed Belfour's turn to play the
villain.
</P>
<P>
   Friday: Avalanche at Oilers: In the middle of their longest road
trip of the season, Avs get a reminder of just what made them
slump. Oilers get to revisit their first-round playoff upset.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday: Rangers at Maple Leafs: First of Wayne Gretzky's two
final visits to Maple Leaf Gardens. Not a dry eye in the place.

TEXAS HIGH SCHOOL PLAYER GAINS 525 YARDS IN GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHARD TIJERINA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ One day later, the feat looked as impressive on
film as it did live.
</P>
<P>
   When Irving High School football coach Jim Bennett watched the
videotape from Friday's 45-29 victory against L.D. Bell yesterday
morning, it was like watching a Mother Goose nursery rhyme and
fairy tale with junior tailback Tyson Thompson as the main
character.
</P>
<P>
   See Tyson run.
</P>
<P>
   See Tyson score.
</P>
<P>
   Score, Tyson, score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a running back before who rushed for 318 yards one
week and 387 the next, but I've never had one like this. It's
unheard of,'' Bennett said. ``Friday night was just wild. We'd call
a play and I would really think, `We have a chance to score on this
one and we were only 30 yards out of our end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe all the planets were aligned just right, or Irving's
offensive line and downfield blockers all clicked on the same night
or maybe Thompson simply was lucky. But what he did against the
Blue Raiders, few have done before.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson rushed for 525 yards on 32 carries, scoring all seven
Irving touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   It was Thompson's trick and Irving's treat.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of a night was it for Thompson? His seven touchdown
runs alone totaled up 464 yards. He didn't have a single touchdown
of fewer than 50 yards. On consecutive carries, he scored from 80
yards and again from 89. He averaged more than 16 yards each time
he carried the ball. Of 38 total offensive plays run by Irving, 32
of them went Thompson's way.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a tailback who, a few months ago, was running with
the third-team offense because Bennett doubted his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of confidence in my offensive line and I knew
that \RBell\S was a little weak in the cut-back lanes,'' said
Thompson, who leadshigh school players in the Northeast Tarrant
County area with 1,985 yards and 19 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson _ who scored on runs of 74, 52, 66, 53, 80, 89 and 50
yards _ is closing in on an all-time Irving city rushing record for
a single season. Ten years ago, Nimitz's Rodrick Walker rushed for
2,121 yards. Thompson needs 137 yards against MacArthur in the
season finale to break that mark.
</P>
<P>
   More than Walker's mark will be at stake, however, for the
Tigers (5-4, 3-3 District 6-5A). To earn a playoff berth, Irving
must defeat MacArthur, then hope Paschal upsets Nimitz or L.D. Bell
upsets Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the season, Bennett was most optimistic about his
beefy offensive line, which includes 225-pound center Brad
Hendricks, 282-pound left guard Paul Balensiefen and 285-pound left
tackle Chris Boggus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he'll ever have another game like that, but
he's been very consistent this year,'' Bennett said. ``He's really
disappointed with a 100-yard game, when most backs think of that as
a milestone. It's usually, `Coach, I think I'm gonna get 250
tonight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He got twice that and more Friday night.

YANKEES DECIDE TO KEEP GIRARDI  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joe Girardi was told last Monday that the Yankees
would not pick up their $3.4 million option on his contract for
1999, and he said goodbye to the principal owner George
Steinbrenner. Girardi, essentially a backup to catcher Jorge
Posada, was seemingly headed to the Chicago Cubs or the Baltimore
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   But in a stunning reversal, the Yankees announced on Saturday
that they were exercising the 1999 option on Girardi. General
Manager Brian Cashman said in a statement: ``At a time when quality
catching is at a premium, Joe Girardi is one of the best defensive
catchers in baseball and Jorge Posada is one of the game's emerging
stars at that position. You also cannot overstate Joe's leadership
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman could not be reached for comment, but another member of
the organization said that Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager,
persuaded Steinbrenner to keep Girardi for his leadership, his
ability to handle pitchers, and his role as a mentor for Posada.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi, in terrific condition and known for his defense, is 34
and his offensive contribution is negligible. Last year, he batted
.276 with 3 home runs and drove in 31 runs in 254 at-bats, and
Torre used him to bunt or hit-and-run.
</P>
<P>
   Posada started 85 games and is a 27-year-old switch-hitter who
is expected to develop into a consistent source of power _ he hit
17 home runs and drove in 63 runs in 358 at-bats, and was among the
best in the American League at throwing out base runners.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping Girardi means the Yankees will have about $57 million
already committed to next year's team, not including David Cone and
Bernie Williams, both of whom may be headed elsewhere next season.

TEXAS REPUBLICANS IN CLOSE RACES EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM BUSH'S
ANTICIPATED LANDSLIDE VICTORY
<TEXT>
<P>
   By R.G. RATCLIFFE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ While Republican Gov. George W. Bush is poised for a
re-election landslide, the races for the next three highest state
offices are coming down to photo finishes, according to a new
Houston Chronicle/Dallas Morning News poll.
</P>
<P>
   The contests for lieutenant governor, attorney general and state
comptroller are statistical dead heats. But the Republicans have
the edge because of the expected size of Bush's victory, said
pollsters Micheline Blum and Julie Weprin.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (expected Bush landslide) is a real problem for the
Democratic Party,'' Weprin said. ``On the down ballot races, it's
much closer, but that Bush victory is likely to carry most of those
Republicans in.''
</P>
<P>
   The race for lieutenant governor has Republican Rick Perry at 46
percent; Democrat John Sharp at 41 percent; and Libertarian Anthony
Garcia at 3 percent, with 11 percent undecided. In a September
poll, Perry led 41 percent to 33 percent for Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found about 40 percent of the voters still don't know
enough about Sharp and Perry to have an opinion of them. And
despite a barrage of negative television commercials, voters still
hold a positive view of the two candidates by a margin of 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy-seven percent of those surveyed said the negative
commercials had not changed their vote for Sharp or Perry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're like identical twins,'' Blum said. ``The same groups
see them in the same way, everything except Republican or
Democratic.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp is leading among independent voters 38 percent to 28
percent, but 27 percent of them are still undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one looks like it has less to do with the candidates than
party. So if they're voting along party lines, that should help
Perry,'' Weprin said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp said he believes independent voters will reject party
labels in making a decision in his race.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Rick is hoping for again is pure party stuff. The problem
with getting elected on pure party stuff, whichever party it is,
that is the way you govern,'' Sharp said.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said the poll shows Sharp's negative campaign commecials
have not worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is, I think, an indication that Texans are responding to
a positive message, and the work that we've done over the course of
17 months is being reflected here,'' Perry said.
</P>
<P>
   In the race for attorney general, Republican John Cornyn has 45
percent voter support to 41 for Democrat Jim Mattox. Cornyn has
overcome a 13-percentage point lead that Mattox held in the Labor
Day survey. Libertarian Mike Angwin has 1 percent support, and 13
percent are undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox, who was attorney general in the 1980s, predicted the
final victory will be his.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident that Texans want a law enforcement attorney
general who is a pro-consumer, pro-environment and pro-average
citizen,'' said Mattox. He said Cornyn is ``anti'' all of that.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn, a former state Supreme Court justice, said he closed the
race with Mattox by reminding voters of Mattox's record in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have now been exposed to my record as a conservative
judge. They think my record and my qualifications are exactly what
we should have in the next attorney general,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat Paul Hobby has made up a similar deficit in the
comptroller's race to make it a contest. Republican Carole Keeton
Rylander now holds 43 percent voter support to Hobby's 42 percent
with Libertarian Alex Monchak at 2 percent. Thirteen percent are
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Hobby likewise said he believed he had broken through with his
commercials outlining Rylander's history in public office.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are starting to pay attention. Texas voters are turning
their backs on vicious politics and broken promises for
responsible, businesslike public service in their next
comptroller,'' Hobby said.
</P>
<P>
   But Rylander said she believes the momentum in the race is still
with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a clear choice in this race. I am the conservative
candidate. He is the liberal candidate,'' Rylander said. ``I
support Governor Bush. He supports Garry Mauro. So I'm excited.
It's happening out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll found Republican David Dewhurst favored over Democrat
Richard Raymond in the land commissioner race, although 19 percent
were still undecided. Dewhurst had 47 percent to Raymond's 31
percent. Libertarian Manuel Montez had 3 percent support.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone survey of 967 likely voters was conducted Oct.
25-30 for the Houston Chronicle and The Dallas Morning News by Blum
&AMP; Weprin Associates Inc. of New York. It has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the poll found Bush coasting to victory over
Democratic challenger Garry Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's lead is 70 percent to 23 percent, with 6 percent
undecided. Only four people surveyed said they were for Libertarian
Les Turlington of Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing send-off on the road to the White House,''
Weprin said of Bush's lead and the prospects that he will run for
the Republican presidential nomination in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-six percent of those surveyed said they want Bush to run
for president, and 69 percent said they are not bothered by him
waiting to make a decision until after the election. Mauro has been
trying to force Bush into saying whether he will serve a full
four-year term if re-elected.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of the Democrats surveyed said Bush is doing a
good job as governor, and 64 percent of the black voters surveyed
said Bush is doing a good job. Those are the only two voter groups
that support Mauro over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The survey showed Bush should reach his goal of making history
by becoming the first Republican to take 40 percent of the Hispanic
vote in Texas. The survey found Bush leading Mauro among Hispanic
voters by 49 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Blum said Mauro has hardly registered with voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of Mauro's vote comes from those people who are going to
vote the straight party vote. There's almost no vote that's for
him,'' Blum said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is proud to have the support he has received in the
poll, but he said it worries him that his voters will decide they
do not have to vote Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important that for this poll to become reality that my
supporters go to the polls,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he is ahead because of his ``message of good schools,
lean government, a compassionate welfare system. The voters are
listening to that message.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro, as he has done with every poll showing his deficit,
dismissed the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I promise you it's wrong. My polls have me at about 10 down
and closing,'' he said. ``It's not devastating to me because I'm
going to win this election.''

REAL ESTATE: AS FINANCING POOL DRIES UP, SOME SEE OPPORTUNITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Traditional real-estate lenders, largely forced to
the sidelines in recent years by Wall Street firms, are moving to
take advantage of the virtual shutdown of the public market for
commercial mortgage-backed securities. These lenders, which include
banks and insurance companies, had been largely displaced by Wall
Street concerns such as Lehman Brothers, Credit Suisse First Boston
and Nomura Securities.
</P>
<P>
   But with the lending squeeze caused by the drying up of the
commercial mortgage-backed security pipeline, the real estate
industry's traditional lenders sense an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, this is good for my business,'' said John Bralower,
the president of Sonnenblick-Goldman Co., a real estate investment
bank. ``When people could pick up the phone and get 90 percent
financing from Lehman, it was hard to compete. Now the market needs
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing deals that were being done by investment bankers
coming back to commercial banks,'' said John Cook, president of the
New York division of the Buffalo-based M&AMP;T Bank. And with billions
of dollars of loans sitting unsold on Wall Street's books, he said,
there may be an opportunity for commercial banks to buy some of
them, presumably at a discount.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said the bank was looking at eight to 10 specific pieces of
business, including a $55 million mortgage loan from an investment
bank, but had not yet concluded the transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good time to be a commercial banker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The public credit markets became a huge force in real estate
starting in the mid '90s as investment banks lent money for
mortgages and pooled the loans into securities that they sold to
institutional investors, such as pension funds.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the mortgage-backed securities placed by companies
called conduits, which are institutions that make loans they intend
to pass on to investment bankers for sale, has grown rapidly, from
a total of $700 million in 1993 to $23 billion last year, according
to Whitney Wilcox, the New York area president of Holliday,
Fenoglio, Fowler, LP, a real estate investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   This has connected real estate to Wall Street as never before.
One result is that volatility in financial markets is quickly felt
in real estate, which reacted much less directly to market
fluctuations in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The conduit part of the overall mortgage-backed securities
market, which includes insurance companies and other property
owners who sell securities, has grown rapidly, from a $700 million
share of an overall market of $17 billion in 1993 to a projected
$60 billion share of an anticipated overall $80 billion market this
year, Wilcox said.
</P>
<P>
   In September, economic turmoil in Asia and Russia made
bond-market investors less tolerant of risk and so they began
demanding higher interest rates on all debt investments. This
caught investment bankers holding billions of dollars of loans
that, pooled and turned into securities, could only be sold at a
loss. As a result they stopped making new loans, causing a
tightening of credit in real estate.
</P>
<P>
   The pileup of loans is substantial, according to estimates. ``I
think the number is close to $50 billion,'' said John Lyons,
executive managing director of Granite Partners, a real estate
investment firm. ``There are $20 billion to $30 billion in loans
that have not been sold and another $20 billion in the pipeline
that have been already been purchased to be sold.''
</P>
<P>
   But many people in the real estate industry say that with the
re-entry of traditional lenders, such as commercial banks and
insurance companies, the real shortage is limited to overly
leveraged projects, those that have a very high proportion of debt
to equity, and new development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still financing available for cash-flow properties,''
or those with established incomes, said Howard Michaels, chairman
of Carlton Group, a sales brokerage and finance company. But, he
added, ``the market is very difficult for development properties.''
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate executives said the return of established real
estate lenders and efforts on Wall Street to restart the market for
mortgage-backed securities should largely solve the problem by the
beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry will work out of this situation,'' said Dennis
Yeskey, the regional managing partner of Deloitte &AMP; Touche Real
Estate Services. ``The guys who were doing the underwriting will
take a beating, but long term it won't rattle the markets.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, institutional investors who may have exhausted
their yearly investment allocation in the frenzied market this
year, will be back with fresh allocations as of Jan. 1, said
Jeffrey Cooper, a senior director at Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, a
financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   And, real estate executives note, the Wall Street companies who
are currently holding loans that can only be sold at a loss have
years of profits from trading the mortgage-backed securities to
absorb the losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming back to the market because they believe the
risk has been underwritten,'' or discounted, said Lyons of Granite
Partners. ``Three to four weeks ago, it was a standstill. But now
the free fall has ended. The amount of money available for real
estate has not changed. The price of it has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate and finance executives said vast amounts of money
that was invested in Treasury securities during September and the
early part of October for safety are beginning to trickle out as
investors are enticed by the higher interest rates available on
other forms of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Many real estate executives say the temporary lack of liquidity
may actually have a beneficial effect, by preventing overbuilding
before it happens and by preventing overeager buyers from doing
highly leveraged deals.
</P>
<P>
   Because they do not have the risk of holding loans, since they
are usually sold shortly after being assembled, investment banks
were much more aggressive in their financing than traditional
lenders, supplying up to 95 percent of a property's price.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bank or insurance company will not lend more than 75
percent,'' said Michaels. ``The rest is equity.'' Pending deals
based on obtaining 85 percent or 90 percent financing have been put
on hold, executives say, because would-be buyers are unwilling or
unable to come up with more equity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The match between real estate, which is a long-term business,
and the short-term trading culture of Wall Street was always an odd
one in many ways, executives say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is a lot different than it was 10 years ago,'' said
Barry Gosin, chief executive of Newmark &AMP; Company Real Estate. ``In
the past, when a bank or insurance company lent money it was for
the long term.''
</P>
<P>
   The lender would stay in contact with the borrower and collect
payments. Developers and lenders had relationships that endured
from project to project. Investment bankers, on the other hand,
wanted to make loans, sell them and collect a fee with little
regard to the individuals involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``A developer or an owner sees real estate as an asset, and they
concentrate on improving the value of that asset,'' said Martin
Kravet, the president of Royal Abstract, a New York title insurance
company. ``Wall Street guys don't care about asset values, they
just want to generate fees.''
</P>
<P>
   The problems with the mortgage-backed securities market may also
provide some opportunities to buyers with cash in their pockets, as
planned highly leveraged transactions fall short on financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people who have access to equity are taking advantage of
failed transactions,'' said Cooper of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield,
discussing the market for commercial buildings. ``A lot of bids
were received in late August, just before the credit market
problems. The next round of bids was lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooper and other real estate executives said that the reductions
in the bids ranged from under 5 percent for top-quality properties
to as much as 20 percent for lower-grade buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the buildings reported by real estate executives to have
been taken off the market since the mortgage-backed securities
market tightened are the Revlon Building at 625 Madison Ave. and
buildings at 717 Fifth Ave. and 450 Lexington Ave.
</P>
<P>
   The liquidity shortage is affecting more than building sales,
brokers report. In addition to hesitation on the part of tenants to
move or take added space because of economic uncertainty, landlords
are hampered in their ability to close transactions because of
their own need to access capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Building owners need money to pay commissions and for tenant
installations,'' which include interior renovations, said Peter
Riguardi, an executive vice president of Collins ABR, a real estate
services company. ``That kind of money has dried up and the
velocity of deals has slowed. The market is going to be quieter for
the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Real estate executives continue to point out that, despite
gyrations in financial markets, the fundamentals of New York real
estate remain solid. Employment is high, office space vacancy rates
are low and rental rates are holding. ``The good news is there is
no space,'' said Gosin, the Newmark chief.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the '80s when a building boom left vast amounts of space
vacant, almost nothing has been built in the '90s, so supply is in
line with demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with real estate,'' said Kevin
Haggarty, an executive managing director of Insignia/ESG's capital
market group. ``We did not cause the problem by overbuilding.''

NEW FACE MAKES CONGRESSIONAL RACE A CLOSE CONTEST
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Kevin J. O'Connor is a 31-year-old Republican
who quit his job at a Hartford law firm to run for Congress in a
district that hasn't voted for a Republican representative in 42
years.
</P>
<P>
   For months, he has been living the mundane parts of his life on
the public stage, faxing out an hour-by-hour account of his comings
and goings, including trips to bowling alleys, diners and even his
attendance at Mass. His toddling nephews blow kisses to commuters
as volunteers wave his signs, his four brothers drive him, his
mother and sister have made more than 1,000 telephone calls on his
behalf and his father is the yard-sign director for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of such hustle, O'Connor has become a Cinderella
candidate who turned one of the most predictable races in
Connecticut into one that is too close to call. O'Connor, who was a
lacrosse captain in college and sprinkles his speech with
expressions like ``take one for the team,'' has held fund-raisers
in sports bars, bought space for his face on the sides of 50 buses
around Hartford and kicked off his campaign by running 98 miles
through the district _ roughly five miles for each of the 20 towns.
</P>
<P>
   The 1st District seat opened when U.S. Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly,
who has represented the area since 1982, decided to run for
governor. The district has voted so reliably Democratic that when
John B. Larson, 50, the former president pro tem of the state
Senate, won the Democratic primary in September, several
publications said he might as well have won the election.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he finds himself in a horse race with the man Gov. John
G. Rowland, a Republican, calls the most interesting new face in
Connecticut politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Kevin doesn't win, I will cry on election night,'' said
Rowland. ``This guy has worked like I've never seen a candidate
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Strategists for both parties said O'Connor is the candidate most
likely to ride on the coattails of Rowland if he is re-elected in a
landslide.
</P>
<P>
   The National Republican Congressional Committee and the
Republican National Committee, which had planned to ignore the
race, decided in early October to spend $70,000 on television
advertising for O'Connor. Jack Kemp campaigned for him on Friday.
The Hartford Courant stunned the state's political establishment by
endorsing him, and Democratic strategists already worry about him
eventually running for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Larson, however, has labor unions helping to turn out his vote,
and has appeared in television advertisements with Sen. Christopher
J. Dodd, a Democrat who is predicted to make a strong run in the
district. Larson, an insurance consultant, said experience is his
major advantage over his opponent. ``He says all the time, `a fresh
face,''' Larson said. ``I think that's just another way of saying,
`I have no record.'''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, a former Democrat, worked as counsel for the
Securities and Exchange Commission and as a law clerk for the U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals. O'Connor has brought an innocence to the
race, freely acknowledging his opponent's strong points, and
appearing in his attack ads against Larson, instead of the usual
approach of leaving those to a narrator. ``It's more fair,''
O'Connor explained.
</P>
<P>
   When O'Connor began the race, he said this was his one shot at
politics, since an incumbent would be hard to knock off, and after
the election he could marry and focus on starting a family. Now,
recognizing he may come agonizingly close to winning the election
but fall short, he said he would run again for public office.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor has a moderate platform, including support for abortion
rights and an emphasis on revitalizing blighted areas of Hartford.
But Larson has tried to portray him as right-wing, saying people
will support O'Connor if they think House Speaker Newt Gingrich
``needs some more soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor tells audiences that as a Republican representing a
heavily Democratic district, he would bring ``urgency and
accountability'' to the job, saying, ``I know that every two years,
Democrats are going to be gunning for me.''

CLOSING OF HOME SHATTERS LIVES OF RESIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The pleasures of their lives were admittedly simple _
baking peanut butter cookies, growing tiny plants in window boxes,
making the occasional trip to the mall. Others were no longer able
to bake or even read, and contented themselves in wheelchairs on
the boardwalk.
</P>
<P>
   While some people generally regard nursing homes as depressingly
unwelcome places, many of the residents of city-run Neponsit Health
Care Center in the Rockaways, poor and chronically sick, got their
first taste of stability and community at the beachfront nursing
home.
</P>
<P>
   But that stability and community came apart in September when
the city suddenly closed the home and scattered its 282 residents
throughout the health care system, where 53 are still waiting for
permanent homes. Two have since died and one is missing, and
advocates are embroiled in a fierce debate with the city's Health
and Hospitals Corp. over whether the move hastened those
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Some former residents, like the many Alzheimer's patients, are
simply bewildered. Others, who had grown accustomed to a life
peppered with daily activity, are simply bored. Others still,
especially those who came to Neponsit from considerably worse
places, fear for their future.
</P>
<P>
   When the city hospitals agency closed the 85-year-old home on
Sept. 10, officials said its deteriorating buildings had been made
unsafe by a Labor Day storm. And last week, saying that the
estimated $51 million price tag on repairs was too high, they
announced that the home would be closed and bulldozed and the land
turned into a park.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Legal Aid Society and the law firm Kaye, Scholer,
Feirman, Hays &AMP; Handler succeeded in enjoining the city from
demolishing the center, pending a Wednesday hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The closing has attracted the attention of regulators,
politicians and advocates for the elderly and poor, all of whom
have criticized the way the residents were moved _ on the fly and
without many of their belongings _ and the way they have been
housed since. The Federal Health Care Finance Administration, which
runs Medicare and Medicaid, is fining the city $3,050 a day until
all the residents are placed in long-term homes.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, local politicians and advocates say the
closing underscores a lack of commitment to medical care for the
poor as the city tries to cut costs and make the sprawling public
hospital system pay for itself in an increasingly cutthroat health
care market.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, city officials say they remain committed to the
public health system, but simply could not let Neponsit stand. ``I
had to balance the potential for the stress associated with the
sudden change in environment with the real risk of physical harm to
residents, employees and visitors,'' said Dr. Luis Marcos,
president of Health and Hospitals Corp. And the corporation is
fighting the fine, contending that the state and federal
governments have not assisted in the problem as promised.
</P>
<P>
   Like the city's four other long-term care centers, Neponsit was
something akin to a shelter for the poor and sick, people who could
not live on their own but had nowhere else to go. Many were only in
their 50s but had cancer or other disabling diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Marie Converse, who said she was beaten so badly by a former
roommate that she required spinal surgery and depends on a
wheelchair, built herself a social system at Neponsit based around
resident committees that would decide things like how the laundry
would be done or what would be served for dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Hermi Miranda, who had lived on the couches of friends in upper
Manhattan for several years before being diagnosed as having
stomach cancer, loved the privacy of his own room, to which he
could retreat when he was feeling poorly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neponsit is beautiful,'' Miranda said. ``We lived there
together as friends, and now everybody is separated. All because
the building has some little cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with several residents and Neponsit workers paint a
picture of 48 hours in September of confusion and misery during
which elderly and sick people were given a few hours notice to pack
their belongings into plastic bags before they were shepherded to a
bus to go to hospitals or other temporary nursing homes. Some went
by ambulance, still in sleeping gowns.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the patients found their first stop at a public hospital
like Elmhurst Hospital Center or Bellevue Hospital Center, and that
is where things started to unravel. Karen Lee's father, who has
suffered for many years from Alzheimer's disease, was moved to
Bellevue. ``The first thing I heard was that he fell out of a chair
and bumped his head,'' she said. ``Now, he has bruises all over his
legs.''
</P>
<P>
   His next stop was the Susan Smith McKinney Nursing Home in
Brooklyn, where many patients were transferred.
</P>
<P>
   The state and the Federal Health Care Finance Administration
have contended that residents were placed in homes where there is
not enough proper care or appropriate recreation. The state
Department of Health's report on the relocation of the residents
ticked off dozens of infractions, ranging from a lack of
rehabilitation therapy to Jewish residents' having no place to go
for Rosh Hashanah.
</P>
<P>
   But city hospitals officials say they long ago asked the Federal
Health Care Finance Administration and the state for assistance
that never came. This led to difficulties finding appropriate
placement for residents, they say. Officials at the federal agency
say that is not the case, and that they were not even informed that
Neponsit was being evacuated until after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   Neponsit's residents referred to one another as family, and
their active recreational lives gave them succor in their
less-than-perfect circumstances. They read the Bible and Patti
LaBelle's autobiography in a book club. There were weekend
barbecues and daily meetings to cook, paint, garden and make
crafts.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day, Miss Converse was found sitting in her
wheelchair in her room at Susan McKinney, listening to a Sony
Walkman. ``I've got to get out of here,'' she said. ``This is a
nice place, but there is nothing to do. I had more freedom over at
Neponsit. I can't get around here, and I get bored. I finally have
a little wood project but there is really nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Rockaway residents, who will get a park out of Neponsit's
destruction, seem to be sympathetic to its former residents. ``The
whole neighborhood suspects an ulterior motive,'' said Jose
Fernandez, 68, a retiree whose back yard faces the center. ``Moving
these people in the middle of the night was a very underhanded way
of doing things.''

CHECK OFFERED TO RESOLVE JONES LAWSUIT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Abe Hirschfeld, who injected himself into the Paula
Corbin Jones lawsuit, withdrew and then re-entered the picture on
Saturday before television cameras here, where he made a symbolic
presentation to Ms. Jones of a $1 million check as an incentive to
help settle her sexual harassment lawsuit against President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers for both sides said Saturday's event was not
expected to have any impact because Hirschfeld's check, made out to
Ms. Jones and her lawyers, may be cashed only if both sides agree
to settle the lawsuit. Lawyers for both parties said they had not
had any recent discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld told reporters during the check-passing ceremony that
``I only care that the market should go up, the people should be
working and the economy should be singing.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials have said they do not want to have
anything to do with Hirschfeld, the New York City real estate
magnate, political candidate and, briefly, the owner of the New
York Post.
</P>
<P>
   Hirschfeld remains under indictment for tax fraud in Manhattan,
White House officials said. In addition, if his money was used to
settle the lawsuit, it would raise the question of whether the
money would be considered as benefiting Clinton, in which case the
president would be required to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Ms. Jones and Clinton were close to settling the
lawsuit in early October. Ms. Jones had demanded a $1 million
payment from Clinton and the White House had offered $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   But with Hirschfeld's offer, Ms. Jones saw a way to put together
a large package; she then asked for $1 million from Clinton in
addition to the Hirschfeld contribution, for a total of $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The White House quickly rejected the proposal. As a result of
the breakdown in negotiations, both sides went ahead with arguments
earlier this month in St. Paul before a panel of appeals court
judges over whether the lawsuit should be reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge dismissed the lawsuit by Ms. Jones in
April, saying that her account of being propositioned by Clinton in
a Little Rock hotel room in 1991 did not amount to a legal case of
sexual harassment.

Rockets, Spurs stand to benefit as challenging November schedule
dribbles away
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Looking at things optimistically, the 1998-99 NBA season might
actually begin in 1998. We might not have to hold a bake sale to
keep Patrick Ewing in luxury cars. Wins and losses might not refer
to a Michael Jordan-Abe Pollin debate.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the NBA season might start. And because it will not
begin Tuesday as once planned, the November schedule scrapped so
the NBA owners and players can haggle, someone figures to benefit
when they play a schedule with at least its first month lopped off.
</P>
<P>
   Games canceled could be rescheduled. But although NBA
commissioner David Stern held open the door for such a possibility
this week, that seems unlikely because so many arenas have their
spring calendars filled. The season could be extended. Schedule
changes could be made to ensure every team plays every other team
at least once. The playoffs could be cut back to accommodate more
regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   But the most likely scenario finds November's schedule lost
forever, with December games likely lost as well.
</P>
<P>
   And with November's schedule gone, so too could be some
competitive fairness that could make a difference when the issues
change from a hard cap to the hardwood.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets will not have to play that grueling November
schedule that began with a back-to-back pair of games and ended
with four road games including another back-to-back at Utah and
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets would have played eight road games in November, the
most of any West contender. They would have played four games
against last season's conference finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Unless games are rescheduled, they won't have to play in
Indianapolis this season, will play the Bulls only once, in
Chicago, and will have two of their meetings with the Jazz
eliminated. And if there's another cut in the schedule, the
remaining Bulls game will be lost. A home game against the Lakers
might also soon be gone.
</P>
<P>
   The first two weeks of December would include six games against
four playoff teams, and two against the sort of young and athletic
teams, Detroit and Boston, that have given the Rockets trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Of the West contenders _ the Rockets, Spurs, SuperSonics, Jazz
and Lakers _ only the Spurs could be considered to have escaped a
tougher start.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs did not have quite as many road games on their
September schedule. But there is no doubt that when they first saw
this season's schedule, an opening month with four back-to-back
tests, all ending on the road and accounting for all seven road
games in the month, it jumped off the page.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs won't mind missing that challenge, and they likely
will not have to make up home games against the Pacers, Bulls,
SuperSonics and Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spurs would like no more games lost for more than the
reasons the NBA presumably shares. The first two weeks of December
would bring home games against Dallas and Boston, a trip to
Philadelphia and New York, before a visit from the Clippers, a run
of five games against four lottery teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were the West's big losers in the lockout shuffle.
The Lakers had by far the easiest first month schedule, indicating
a tougher schedule to come.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were to play six road games, but only two would have
been against playoff teams, the Cavaliers and Hawks in the only
back-to-back. The Lakers would have played only six games against
playoff teams all month. And the next cut will cost the Lakers at
least four more home games before a trip to Texas to play the
Mavericks and Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lakers, things will be most difficult when the 1999 part
of the season begins. And if that might seem a long way off, so
might the start of the season, whenever that will be.
</P>
<P>
   More certain is that whenever it does get going and teams begin
jockeying for position, they will look back on the games they
didn't have to play to argue who won without playing.

LACK OF SUBSIDIZED HOUSING CITED IN PLIGHT OF HOMELESS
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After following hundreds of homeless families in New
York City to determine if social disorders prolonged their
situation, a new study by New York University suggests the real
problem is the city's scarcity of subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   The study, to be released Tuesday in the American Journal of
Public Health, challenges a widely held view that the most
effective way to end homelessness among families is by first
resolving such problems as mental illness and substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The study concluded that homeless families, when provided with
subsidized housing, could remain ``stable'' _ which the study
defined as staying in the same apartment for at least 12 months _
regardless of the problems they battled. The research, done between
1988 and 1993, is considered the first long-term look at how social
disorders affect families' abilities to find their way out of
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom is that homeless families need to
become rehabilitated before they can become housed,'' said Marybeth
Shinn, a professor of psychology at New York University and
co-author of the study. ``Our findings show that if given the
housing first, homeless families will become stable and remain
stable.''
</P>
<P>
   The study did not look at single homeless adults, where
incidents of mental illness and substance abuse tend to be more
serious and widespread.
</P>
<P>
   In reaching their conclusion, researchers interviewed 564
families. Half of them were homeless for the first time; the other
half were randomly drawn from the city's public assistance case
load and had never been homeless. Every family was interviewed
twice, once in 1988 and again five years later.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers found that 80 percent of the homeless families who
were given a subsidized apartment were able to remain stable,
despite their problems. Their rate of success in remaining housed
matched that of the families who had never been homeless. One
reason for the homeless families' success, researchers concluded,
was that their rent was paid directly to a landlord.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not address what effect the acquisition of a
stable apartment had on helping the families resolve their personal
problems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``We're not saying that social services couldn't prove
advantageous to these families, or that substance abuse and mental
illness don't take tolls on families,'' said Beth Weitzman,
associate professor in NYU's Robert Wagner Graduate School of
Public Service and a co-author of the study. ``But those issues are
all separate and distinct from homelessness. Just because a family
has problems doesn't mean they can't remain housed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the homeless families who did not receive subsidized housing,
only 18 percent found permanent housing, mostly by moving in with a
relative or friend, the study found. Researchers linked their low
success rate in part to the fact that some families left the
shelter before they were deemed eligible for housing. Those who
left forfeited their spots on the waiting list. During the time of
the study, most families had to wait six to 18 months before
becoming eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Some veteran researchers of homelessness hailed the NYU study
for trying to refocus one of the oldest debates surrounding
homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study will inevitably be read by many people as
dismissing the importance of social services,'' said Jim Baumohl,
an associate professor of social welfare at Bryn Mawr College in
Pennsylvania. ``But what it's really saying is that if the goal is
still to reduce shelter utilization, then we to ought to consider a
strategy of rapid attachment to housing, rather than assuming
homeless families can't stay housed.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Wiviott, a spokeswoman for the city's Department of
Homeless Services, said she had not yet seen a copy of the study.
But she said the city shared the view that subsidized housing was
an effective way of helping the 4,700 homeless families now living
in the city's shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Giuliani administration took office, Ms. Wiviott said,
21,000 homeless families have moved out of shelters and into
subsidized housing. But she added that in the wake of the federal
government's recent decision to scale back national housing
subsidies, New York was ill equipped to foot the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alone, we can't afford to house everybody who needs subsidized
housing. Our hope is that Washington recognizes the need to
continue its contribution of Section 8 and other federal
subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   The NYU study was financed through a grant from the National
Institute of Mental Health.

THE ETHICAL WAY TO LOSE AN ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tom Volgy, the Democratic candidate from Arizona's 5th
Congressional District, held a press conference recently to
announce his decision to lose by a landslide to incumbent
Republican Rep. Jim Kolbe.
</P>
<P>
   Although, those weren't his exact words.
</P>
<P>
   What Volgy said was that he'd stopped accepting campaign
contributions because he'd reached his self-imposed limit of
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Kolbe camp had no immediate response to Volgy's action, or
at least none that could be heard over the laughter and pop, pop,
popping of champagne magnums.
</P>
<P>
   For Volgy, the decision to shut off the flow of campaign funds
and return any new donations is the final _ and perhaps most
successful _ stage of a meticulously crafted campaign strategy in
which an underfunded dark horse leads himself, step by step, to the
political glue factory.
</P>
<P>
   It all began months ago, when Volgy first outlined his game plan
for defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Although, those weren't his exact words.
</P>
<P>
   What Volgy said was that he would accept no donations from
political action committees. This is a wonderful thing to say. It's
exactly what voters want to hear. &QL; 
MCCAIN'S FURIOUS FIGHTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's popular U.S. Sen. John McCain, for example, has led a
very spirited movement to change campaign financing in America,
including the influence of PACs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wages a furious fight for reform each year in Congress,
and loses. Then he goes home, collects millions for his own
political war chest, including bucketfuls of dough from PACs, and
uses the money to produce slick election commercials highlighting
his commitment to campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   See how it works?
</P>
<P>
   Volgy doesn't seem to get it.
</P>
<P>
   While he put a $250,000 limit on his total campaign and refused
to take PAC money, his opponent, as of last month, already had
collected about $225,000 from PACs and another $300,000 from
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked Volgy about this, he said, ``I can't just say these
things. If the system is to change, as it must, I have to live
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Volgy was asked, is the great campaign reform
leader McCain endorsing you?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, politely. &QL; 
SLINGING NO MUD?
</P>
<P>
   What about the use of mudslinging campaign commercials?
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns all over the state are producing them, with Rep.
Foghorn Leghorn Hayworth using the loudest, longest, ugliest and
meanest against challenger Steve Owens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not doing attack ads,'' Volgy said.
</P>
<P>
   He disagrees with Rep. Kolbe, he said, but still respects him.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added, ``About 80 percent of our money has been spent
reaching out directly to voters through mailings and other efforts.
I've done about 180 coffees. The response has been tremendous. We
feel very good about what we've accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   Volgy is one of those politicians who assume voters are
intelligent, principled people who look for the same in their
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Which is close.
</P>
<P>
   Voters are intelligent, principled people who look for the
opposite in their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   This system has been in operation for over 200 years. Now, along
comes this guy Volgy who says stuff like, ``Our campaign is
dedicated to the simple proposition: Our forefathers created the
U.S. House of Representatives to be OUR house, to represent us.''
</P>
<P>
   As guileless as that makes him, the thing that upsets me most
about a man like Volgy isn't his naivete. It's his location.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson. Outside my district, where I can't vote for him. &QL;

BOBBY RAHAL TO END HIS CEREBRAL (AND SAFE) RACING CAREER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ohio, Ill.)  (jw) 
 By JOSEPH SIANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was always the line on Bobby Rahal: He didn't look like a
racing driver. In response, the balding, bespectacled, slightly
professorial Rahal would ask: What is a racing driver supposed to
look like?
</P>
<P>
   Good point. But maybe what people were really saying was that
Bobby Rahal didn't seem like the kind of person who should be a
racing driver. With a degree in history from Denison University in
Granville, Ohio, he was too smart; after a brief time at a Chicago
ad agency, he was too worldly; and the way he took to building
relationships with sponsors, he was too businesslike.
</P>
<P>
   He was auto racing's first yuppie, which helps explain why A.J.
Foyt never liked him. But after Rahal ends his driving career
Sunday afternoon at the California 500 in Fontana (at the unusually
young age of 45 _ talk about being too smart for this business!),
he can settle into his role as team owner and car dealer. And we
can all stand safely back and watch Indy-car racing's new
win-or-crash generation reduce it to total mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   It is just too bad. With Rahal around, there was at least one
helmet with something substantial going on inside it. Like one of
his favorite movies, ``Dr. Strangelove'' (he bears an uncanny
resemblance to Peter Sellers' President Merkin Muffley, come to
think of it), his skills and contributions to racing take a little
thought to fully appreciate. Rahal won 24 Indy car races from 1982
to 1992, dominating the series for a decade with a cerebral driving
style that was short on the flash factor, just as it was short on
the crash factor.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, when Debi Rahal showed up at Indy with a neck
brace following a fall while horseback riding, someone asked her
husband if he had ever thought about getting on a horse. ``Anything
that big, with a brain that small, is not to be trusted,'' he said.
What sounded like sarcasm was really common sense, from a man who
knew where he was most in control. At the risk of teasing the
racing gods, with 500 treacherous miles still to go today, let it
be noted that Rahal drove some of the world's fastest racing cars
for 17 years and has not suffered anything worse than a few broken
ribs.
</P>
<P>
   One of his few real flashes of aggression brought him his
greatest victory _ at the 1986 Indianapolis 500, when he pounced on
Kevin Cogan on a late-race restart, grabbing the lead and pulling
away to win for Jim Trueman, his car owner, who had only 11 more
days to live, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   There's another memory of Rahal at Indy _ one that he calls his
worst, but one that ought to be bronzed and shown to whiny punks
like Tony Stewart, who used an obscenity on television this year to
describe how rudely the Indy 500 has treated him by not letting him
win in any of his first three attempts.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1993, the year that Rahal decided to build his own car
along with Carl Hogan, his partner at the time. Rahal stuck with
this mongrel of a race car just long enough to miss qualifying for
the Indy 500. It was a terrible humiliation, but Rahal climbed from
the car, held on to his dignity and faced the microphones and tape
recorders. The next day, he was just as gracious in rehashing the
whole debacle with another reporter over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, when Roger Penske's powerhouse team failed to
qualify at Indy, Penske immediately rushed his drivers back to the
garage and slammed the door shut, taking about an hour to put on a
face for the news media. And the next day, the slick-in-victory
Penske public-relations machine wasn't returning phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   That decision to build his own car was one of a number of
ill-timed choices that sapped much of the competitiveness from the
last few years of Rahal's career. In 1994, he decided to let his
team be the guinea pig for Honda's new Indy-car engine. After the
engine performed poorly in its debut year, Rahal _ very likely
feeling sponsor pressure in the wake of the 1993 Indy debacle _
dropped Honda. Another mistake, as the engine now dominates
Indy-car racing and Honda is unlikely to take Rahal back. And in
1995, he went through an unfriendly split with Hogan.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, he has had David Letterman as a partner
and Bryan Herta _ a young American who recently rewarded Rahal's
patience with his first victory _ as a teammate. But Rahal knew
that his heart was no longer in a sport where his brain always was.
In his two most recent races, Rahal has done something unthinkable
a few years ago: crashing for no other reason than driver error.
Yes, it's time to go. But no one had to tell that to Bobby Rahal.
</P>
<P>
   Which should be no surprise. Ask people to recall an instance in
which Bobby Rahal lost his temper at the track; I came up with only
one _ after an exhibition race at Nazareth six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A cooler head _ in this case, a bald one with glasses _ has
indeed prevailed.

MARIJUANA THERAPY HAS RAZOR-THIN EDGE IN POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona voters _ by a razor-thin margin _ appear ready to give a
second endorsement to the use of marijuana and other illegal drugs
for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   A new ``Arizona Republic'' survey shows 43 percent support
reinstating Arizona's marijuana-for-medicine law, first approved by
voters 2-1 in 1996 but later gutted by state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found 40 percent back legislative efforts to block the
law. Seventeen percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The marijuana-for-medicine question will appear on Tuesday's
ballot as Proposition 300, one of this year's most confusing and
controversial measures. A ``no'' vote means ``yes'' to the medical
use of such drugs as marijuana, LSD, heroin and PCP.
</P>
<P>
   Other major findings:
</P>
<P>
   A solid majority, 62 percent, approve making cockfighting a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-nine percent support Gov. Jane Hull's plan to provide $20
million in state funds annually to buy or lease state trust lands
for open space but prohibit the state from requiring local
governments to adopt growth management ordinances.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three percent oppose the measure, Proposition 303, while
a large bloc of voters, 38 percent, remains undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Support for Proposition 200, which provides public financing for
campaigns, remains strong. Forty-nine percent support the campaign
finance reform plan, compared to 53 percent in a Republic poll
taken Oct. 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   Voters aren't ready to cash in the Arizona Lottery and its
prospector, Windfall Willy. Fifty-nine percent support extending
the Lottery's life until July 1, 2003.
</P>
<P>
   By a wide margin, 61 percent to 23 percent, Maricopa County
voters support a temporary one-fifth cent sales tax to build and
operate new jails.
</P>
<P>
   The statewide poll of 805 registered voters, taken Oct. 24-27
for ``The Republic'' by Precision Research Inc., has an error
margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the marijuana-for-medicine issue, the poll
suggests voters are being swayed by a massive advertising blitz
financed by the same interests behind the proposal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In an ``Arizona Republic'' poll taken Oct. 3-6, the results were
markedly different. That poll found most voters, 51 percent,
supported efforts to block marijuana for medicine, while 30 percent
wanted to reinstate the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always felt that people knew what they were doing'' when
they approved, 2-1, marijuana for medicine two years ago, said Sam
Vagenas, campaign consultant for The People Have Spoken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our public education was to make sure they understood to
preserve their vote from 1996 they need to vote `no,' '' Vagenas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Stan Barnes, chairman of Arizonans Against Heroin, pointed out
that the latest findings are within the poll's margin for error,
making the contest a statistical dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one side has almost $2 million and is spending more than
any other proposition in Arizona this year and the other side has a
few measly dollars, we should be thrilled with the apparent fact
that people are getting the message,'' Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana-for-medicine proponents have collected more than $1.6
million, mostly from three wealthy businessmen. Arizonans Against
Heroin has raised $44,000, according to the latest campaign finance
reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republic'' polls also suggests that heavy spending by the
business and corporate backers of Proposition 303 is paying off.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen and city and county officials rallied with Gov. Jane
Hull on Friday, admitting that the growth-management proposal is
not perfect. They called it a good first step off the path to
becoming another Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox, a former Phoenix
councilwoman, said Proposition 303 would provide a missing tool for
local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have tried our darnedest at both the city and county levels
to regulate growth,'' she said. ``The most important piece was
preserving open spaces. We need Proposition 303. If we don't get
it, open spaces are going to be gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Arlan Colton, preservation coordinator for the state Land
Department, noted that the referendum is part of a ``Growing
Smarter'' package passed by the Legislature in May. It aims to
reduce competition among cities for development, which can turn
pristine desert to a sea of red-tile roofs.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Bahr, conservation coordinator of the Grand Canyon Chapter
of the Sierra Club, said the poll results offer a glimmer of hope
for Proposition 303 opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've (pro-Proposition 303 forces) put almost $1 million
into the campaign already, and they're still only at 39 percent,''
she said. ``I think that shows people are evaluating whether or not
this is a good deal, despite all the `greenwashing' to make it
sound like a real conservation measure.'' &QL;

ZANARDI, RAHAL SAY GOODBYE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ Transition. It happens to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   A guy goes along his way season after season, year after year
and then one day _ one very special day _ everything changes.
Something old comes to an end; something new begins.
</P>
<P>
   Such days are the mileposts that lend our lives perspective. And
we look at them with mixed emotions: sadness for all that is
finished, excitement for all that lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Today is such a day for race stars Alex Zanardi and Bobby Rahal.
Today at California Speedway they will race for the last time in
the series that made each a star, a champion and a millionaire.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi's racing days will, of course, go on. The 32-year-old
Italian, who resurrected his career during a three-year CART run,
will return next season to Formula One, considered the ultimate
racing series by most European drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi bounced around as a part-time driver between a variety
of Formula One teams in the early 1990s. But he was without a ride
when he accepted an invitation to test with CART's Target Chip
Ganassi Racing team in early 1996. In the three years since, he has
become one of the world's racing stars, winning 14 of his 50 starts
and the 1997 and 1998 series championships.
</P>
<P>
   Zanardi said there won't be a lump in his throat as he begins
his final CART race today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be sad or nostalgic because I don't have
anything to be sad about,'' Zanardi said. ``I've had a fantastic
three years here. Maybe my feelings will change when I actually fly
off for the last time and when I say goodbye to all my friends
here, but I won't be thinking about those things before the race.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rahal, today is the end of a 17-year CART career, the last
ride. And he admitted it will be an emotional time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had trouble sleeping before a race, but I have a
feeling that Saturday night I will,'' Rahal said. ``It's going to
be obvious that isn't just another Saturday night before a race.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night was Rahal's 264th night before a race. On 24
occasions he won the following day, including the 1986 Indy 500.
Three times, in 1986, 1987 and 1992, Rahal won season titles.
</P>
<P>
   He would love to win one last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given up yet,'' said Rahal, 45, who last won a race
in 1992. ``I still have one shot. In a 500-mile race, I tell you,
anything can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has gone 101 races without a victory, Rahal is still
far more likely than most of the 28 CART regulars to visit Victory
Lane.
</P>
<P>
   He qualified fifth for today's race and is 10th in season
points. And despite a recent poor run (25th at Vancouver, 16th at
Laguna Seca, 23rd at Houston, 25th in Australia), he had third- and
fourth-place finishes earlier in the season and is still respected
by fellow drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Rahal said that is very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to go out while I was still competitive,'' Rahal
said. ``We've all seen athletes who hung on too long. They struggle
and they become angry and bitter. I love this sport too much to
ever want to come to the track hating it.''
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration, Rahal said, is his desire to spend more
time with his wife and four children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife and I celebrated our 18th wedding anniversary
recently,'' he said. ``We joked that it was really only our ninth
anniversary because I've been gone half the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal will also stay highly involved in racing. Owner of his
team since 1992, he will continue as such, campaigning cars driven
by Bryan Herta and Max Papis in 1999. Nonetheless, CART racing will
miss Rahal's stature as star and elder statesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a true champion both on and off the track,'' CART
president and CEO Andrew Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   The departures of Rahal and Zanardi will cost CART. Gone will be
two of the series' most recognizable faces, leaving casual race
fans far more familiar with NASCAR stars Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin
and Dale Earnhardt than they are most of the new young CART
drivers. With the careers of Michael Andretti and Al Unser Jr.
apparently on the wane, the series needs new young stars to step
forward to capture the public's attention.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it seemed Zanardi would be the one.
</P>
<P>
   With an at times reckless abandon, he stormed through his three
years of CART competition.
</P>
<P>
   At times he was an irritation to fellow drivers, as when he
deliberately left the track and drove on the dirt to pass Herta and
steal the 1996 Laguna Seca race.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no doubting the appeal of his aggressive style and
tenacity. He was a threat to win from any point in the race field,
as he proved early this season at the Long Beach Grand Prix when he
was a lap behind as late as halfway through the race yet sped back
to win.
</P>
<P>
   Despite several on-track run-ins with Zanardi, Herta said the
series will miss him.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past three years, Alex has been the yardstick by which
every driver and team has measured themself,'' Herta said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a little reckless at times,'' said Al Unser Jr.
``There's no denying that. But I think he's learned from it. He's
been a great driver on this series. I hope he comes back.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he will one day.
</P>
<P>
   But at the moment, neither he nor Rahal has quite yet left. And
until the checkered flag later today, both plan to make their
presence felt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep getting asked about my motivation now that I've won the
championship and decided to go to Formula One next year,'' Zanardi
said. ``But I'm just doing what I love. I want to win every race,
so motivation is never a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Rahal couldn't have said it better. And the skill and love for
the sport exhibited by both he and Zanardi are going to be missed.

PRUETT WINS POLE POSITION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ Scott Pruett has just one race left with the Patrick
Racing team.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he put himself in position to make it a memorable
one, winning the pole for today's season finale $1 million CART
Marlboro 500 at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth career pole for Pruett, who has signed to join
Arciero-Wells Racing next season after four seasons and two wins
with Patrick. He earned it with a 233.748-mph lap that _ thanks to
the presence of the speed-reducing Handford wing _ was well under
Mark Blundell's CART and track record time of last year, 240.942
mph.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Vasser, who is battling Adrian Fernandez and Dario
Franchitti for second in the final series standings, will start
next to Pruett. Michael Andretti will start third with Glendale
product Richie Hearn fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Rahal, starting the final race of his 17-year CART career,
will start fifth. Alex Zanardi, who already has the season points
title won, will start 18th, next to Valencia's Bryan Herta.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pole position is very exciting for me personally, being as
how it's my last race with Visteon and Patrick Racing,'' Pruett
said. ``Ever since the announcement of the move, my goal with my
guys has been to... end this season on a high note.''
</P>
<P>
   Of those racers who didn't qualify well, none was distraught. As
they each pointed out, 500 miles offer one plenty of time to make
up ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it is that much of a disadvantage,'' said
Pruett's teammate, Adrian Fernandez, who will start in the last
row. ``If you aren't on the pole or at least in the front row, it's
all pretty much the same.''
</P>
<P>
   And with the Handford Device in use, no one expects one driver
to run away from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The race also figures to be something of a race of attrition. To
win, one must first finish.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers with previous victories at 500 miles include Zanardi,
Rahal, Andretti, Al Unser Jr., Vasser, Pruett, Andre Ribeiro, Greg
Moore _ who won the tour's other 1998 500-mile race in Michigan _
and Mark Blundell, who won last year's inaugural Marlboro 500.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti said he will draw upon that 500-mile experience today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first goal is to be there at the end of the 500 miles,''
he said. ``If you're on the lead lap on the last lap, you'll
probably be a contender.''

CELEBRATING THE GENIUS BEHIND AN IDEA THAT DIDN'T WORK 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The grand ruinous experiment that he inspired, the
late Soviet Union, has collapsed upon itself. His statues have been
consigned, if not to the dustbin of history, then to countless
musty warehouses and scrap yards in what once was called the
Communist bloc. At least in this country, his opus is studied, if
at all, as a dusty relic of a time and circumstance long past.
</P>
<P>
   But Karl Marx, dead and buried for 115 years, can still fill a
hall.
</P>
<P>
   In a birthday party that was at once sentimental and
introspective, a crowd of admirers paid tribute this weekend to the
bushy-haired founder of scientific socialism, packing the grand
hall of Cooper Union to hear debates on leftist politics, dramatic
readings and poetry in celebration of the 150th anniversary of the
publication of the Communist Manifesto that Marx wrote with
Friedrich Engels.
</P>
<P>
   Their compact, biting and, yes, sometimes turgid, prophesy of
the inevitable overthrow of capitalism _ ``Workers of the world,
unite!'' it famously concludes _ still seemed to resonate with the
900 or so fervent union organizers, students, academics and graying
socialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans reject communism without knowing what it is or
reading the manifesto,'' said Charles Li, 17, a senior at the Bronx
High School of Science who received an award at Saturday's debates
from the Brecht Forum, the event's sponsor, for his essay about the
relevance of Marx today. ``You have to have a lot of faith, and we
have to unite in favor of the human race as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   That the manifesto retains the power to move people with its
confident prediction of capitalism's self-destruction may relate to
its unfulfilled promise more than to the political movements that
operate in its name. Or perhaps it is the poverty of political
discourse these days or the habit of judging a society's well-being
largely by the coughs and sneezes of its stock market.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the explanation may lie in something else
entirely, something so lyrical that it could still rouse hundreds
of people late on a Friday night to spring to attention and lustily
sing out by heart, ``Arise, you prisoners of starvation,'' the
marching song of the revolutionary proletariat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are celebrating the legacy of the struggle for social,
racial and gender equality that was started by the young Marx and
Engels in 1848,'' said Sam Anderson, director of the Brecht Forum,
the home of the New York Marxist School. ``This tiny document has
helped inspire and organize millions in the struggle for social
justice all over the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Marx is relevant to political movements in the United
States, however, was a question much discussed over the two-day
conference. There was general agreement that the manifesto
correctly anticipated the vagaries of globalization and that its
description of enslaved workers would fit the New York immigrants
who toil without protection in sweatshops. There was also general
acknowledgment that organized labor today behaves nothing like
Marx's notion of a revolutionary workers' movement and that reform
politics is divided along lines of race and gender rather than
along Marxist ideas of class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got time, though,'' Peter Kwong, who has written
extensively about the conditions of Chinese immigrant workers, said
during a panel discussion on the potential for revolutionary
politics. ``Capitalism isn't going anywhere.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And while the audience applauded when Tony Monteiro, a political
scientist with the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy, called for
``liquidation of the defense budget'' and attacks on what he called
this ``vicious bloodthirsty'' police state, it was less clear what
hopeful revolutionaries are to do.
</P>
<P>
   One proposal, from Daniel Singer, Paris correspondent of the
magazine The Nation, was to create ``a project, a vision of a new
society.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can't be holy scripture,'' he said, ``but a draft that the
movement will work on as it goes along.''
</P>
<P>
   To the diehard faithful, however, those words may sound like
heresy, especially at an event dedicated to a doctrine that has
been frozen on the page for 150 years.
</P>
<P>
   The playwright Tony Kushner suggested as much in a reading from
his plays ``Angels in America'' and ``Slavs!'' in which one
character belittles those who dare to presume that Marxist theory
is a spent force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it enough to reject the past, is it wise to move forward in
this blind fashion, without the cold brilliant light of theory to
guide the way?'' asked Kushner, reading from the lines of his
imaginary Marxist ideologue, Alesii Antedilluvianovich
Prelapsarionov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes we must change _ only show me the theory,'' Kushner's
disdainful old character declares to the would-be reformers talking
about free markets and capitalism. ``Pygmy children of a gigantic
race!'' he bellows. ``Show me the words that will reorder the world
or else keep silent.''

BUDROYALE WINS CAL CUP CLASSIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA _ A year ago, the California Cup, the annual showcase
for the state's breeding industry, inspired horse owner Jeffrey
Sengara to dream a little.
</P>
<P>
   That day at Santa Anita, the 29-year-old Vancouver lumber
executive met veteran trainer Ted West for the first time, their
handshake sealing a partnership recommended to Sengara by his late
father, himself a winning horse owner in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for West to claim horses for Sengara. The hope was
to find a potential stakes star on the scrap heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `Wouldn't it be great to have a horse
(racing) on such a wonderful day?''' Sengara said.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Cal Cup was held for the ninth time, and one of
those former claimers won the $250,000 Cal Cup Classic for Sengara
and West.
</P>
<P>
   Budroyale, ridden by Garrett Gomez, took a comfortable lead and
went on to beat Bagshot by a length to pay $4.20 to his backers
among 29,052 fans at the track. It was the second victory of the
afternoon for Sengara and West, who earlier won the Starter Sprint
Handicap with Slews Royal Son.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have been scripted any better,'' said Sengara, who
paid just $50,000 to claim Budroyale out of a February race at
Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   The Classic was the richest race of a card that offered more
than $1 million in purses for 10 races restricted to Cal-bred
horses.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights included Belle's Flag's sensational return from
injury in the Cal Cup Matron and Big Jag's explosive stretch run in
the Cal Cup Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Belle's Flag edged 2-5 Magical Allure to win the Matron for the
second time, showing she still has a nose for the wire after
breaking her nose in a Hollywood Park accident. The 5-year-old mare
hadn't raced since she stumbled and lost her rider at the start of
the May 30 Milady, ran off and banged into a gate before jogging
back to the barns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found her, she was at someone else's barn, and she was
bleeding profusely,'' trainer Darrell Vienna recalled. ``Other
people _ people I don't know to this day _ were helping her,
applying ice.... We were concerned she'd never come back (to
racing).''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint favorite Big Jag scored the day's most impressive
victory, accelerating out of traffic in the last 100 yards with
Jose Valdivia riding. It was the fourth consecutive win under
trainer Tim Pinfield for 5-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Defending Sprint champion Red finished last and was pulled up
right after the finish by jockey Corey Nakatani. The popular horse
might be retired.
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani, who won aboard Belle's Flag, had the biggest day of
any two-legged individual, also guiding 10-1 Bountiful Dreamer's
down-the-hill rally in the Distaff and Indiahoma's last-to-first
rally in the Mile.
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani's triple gave him 11 Cal Cup wins to tie Gary Stevens
for the lead in the nine-year-old event.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the results were mixed for Santa Anita and the Oak
Tree Racing Association.
</P>
<P>
   Overall wagering, more than $17.4 million, set an Oak Tree
record for a non-Breeders' Cup day. But pick-six wagering fell
short of the $2 million guarantee, forcing an unidentified
insurance company to make up a $494,089 difference.
</P>
<P>
   Four perfect pick-six tickets paid $296,818 after $23 Bountiful
Dreamer, $48 Sunday Stroll (in the Juvenile) and $11.80 Lacquaria
(in the Juvenile Fillies) tripped up most bettors.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Cavonnier's comeback is now planned for the Nov. 22 On
Trust Handicap at Hollywood Park. He was withdrawn from the Cal Cup
Classic after showing signs of a hind-leg problem Thursday....
Ladies Din is 9-5 and Dr Fong 2-1 in the Oak Tree Derby today....
Staying on message: The words ``California,'' ``Calif.'' and
``Cal'' appeared in Saturday's Santa Anita program 197 times.

IS THERE A LINK BETWEEN ADOPTION AND KIDS WHO KILL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Nevada courtroom last month, murderer Jeremy Strohmeyer
delivered a disturbing speech to explain his 1997 strangulation of
a 7-year-old girl at a casino on the California-Nevada state line.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of us who were adopted, not knowing whom or where we
came from can wreck our lives,'' he said. ``It can make us walking
time bombs, full of rage we don't consciously experience, full of
the false belief in a dark and evil nature that we may unwittingly
set out to prove the existence of.''
</P>
<P>
   Each time an adopted child is involved in violent crime, the
taboo question bubbles up from society's womb: Is there a hidden
link between adoption and kids who kill?
</P>
<P>
   Because adoptee behavior is an intensely emotional issue with
little hard data, that question has generated a hot debate among
families and professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts concede that adopted and foster children are more
likely to face problems with mental health, delinquency and
violence. The disagreement involves why that's true.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that anti-social behavior stems primarily from early
childhood trauma. A greater number of adoptees have suffered abuse,
neglect and exposure to drugs or alcohol than the general
population, so these ``special needs'' kids naturally have more
problems in life.
</P>
<P>
   It's not because of adoption, but because of what preceded it,
says Renee Garfinkle, a psychologist and president of the Adoption
Studies Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers say the trauma of being given up for adoption
by a birth mother and placed in another home leaves a gash on the
infant's psyche. If that child doesn't get help, argues
psychologist David Kirschner, the sense of abandonment and
rejection may one day erupt in a flash of blind rage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of the split self,'' said Kirschner. ``These
adoptees who kill, they have what's called a dissociative disorder.
They're on a pathological search for the birth mother. . . . Very
often, by the way, adoptive parents are the targets.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Kirschner carefully qualifies that analysis, noting: ``We are
not talking about most adoptees. We're talking about a subset who
are at risk. But the adoption is key and central.''
</P>
<P>
   But if that's the case, Garfinkle asks, why brand all adoptees
with the pathology of a few?
</P>
<P>
   The debate arises each time an adoptee makes the evening crime
report.
</P>
<P>
   It surfaced in Chandler five years ago when Kathryn and Tammie
Tomassoni, then 12 and 11, respectively, killed their adoptive
mother, took her money and went on a shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   It happened in the Son of Sam killings by David Berkowitz, and
the Hillside Strangler case of Kenneth Bianchi; both men were
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   And now it haunts the disappearance of Cookie Jacobson, a
49-year-old Tempe woman whose adopted children are homicide
suspects.
</P>
<P>
   As searchers dig through a landfill for the victim, police are
focusing on 16-year-old Aaron Jacobson and his younger sister,
Laura.
</P>
<P>
   The boy told detectives he found his mother dead, then he and
his sister put the corpse in a dumpster because they feared being
blamed. Both children were taken into custody but released pending
further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Many adoptive parents cringe at such cases. The world is full of
adoptees who don't commit violent crimes, who love their families,
who have succeeded in life. And there are thousands of killers who
were raised by their biological parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did anyone point to the Menendez brothers and say, `Look!
Another example of biological kids killing their parents?' '' asks
Garfinkle. &QL; 
SUCCESS STORIES
</P>
<P>
   There is no central adoption registry or official tally of
adoptions.Nor is there a comprehensive study on the violence
question.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, psychological theo ries are based on clinical
evaluations and anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are unanimous on one point: Informed couples should have
no qualms about adoption. Far and away, most nonbiological
children, raised with love and understanding, overcome the
so-called ``primal wound'' as well as special needs.
</P>
<P>
   But this is sensitive turf among adoptive families who,
justifiably, feel threatened and insecure.
</P>
<P>
   They may already worry about bonding, racial questions, the
possible sudden appearance of the birth mother, the acceptance of
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   When Chris and Bob Atherton of Phoenix read news reports about
Cookie Jacobson, they seethed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's prejudice _ the bad-seed prejudice,'' said Chris
Atherton. ``When you talk about this, you can hurt a lot of people.
Or you can make things better for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Athertons have a dozen adopted children, and are guardians
to a thirteenth. The kids are different colors and nationalities.
Six have heart defects and one an attention deficit/hyperactivity
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   The Athertons resent the stigma attached to adoptees who didn't
choose their fate, on birth mothers who cared enough to place their
babies in good families, or on adoptive parents who provide loving
homes.
</P>
<P>
   They point out, for example, that victims of parental abuse
would be far more likely to commit crimes if they were kept in
birth families, rather than adopted.
</P>
<P>
   When adopted kids are identified with violence, the Athertons
say, it's as bigoted as noting that a killer is Black, Methodist or
green-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the majority of people realize it's a bunch of crap,''
said Bob Atherton. ``It shouldn't have any bearing on the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacque Guzman, 31, was one of four adopted children in a Casa
Grande family of six kids. There were no distinctions in the home
or the town, she says, and no crises beyond the daily problems in
any home.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 years of marriage, Guzman and her husband, Leonard, are
in the midst of adopting their first child. She knows the
2-year-old has special needs, but figures life has no guarantees,
and biological kids can grow up to be sociopaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at everything, did a lot of research, and we
couldn't ask for a better child,'' Guzman added. ``I'm sitting here
looking at my little boy's picture, thinking, `I don't see him
doing that . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I worry about is that people are going to be
stand-offish about adoption.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police Sgt. Dennis Nebrich raised three adoptees and a
foster child _ plus two birth daughters.
</P>
<P>
   His message: ``Never be afraid to accept the challenges that an
adopted child might bring into your home, because the benefits
out-weigh them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebrich rejects distinctions between adopted and biological
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``True adoption means that you don't see that they're not your
birth kids. I look at them as my sons, period. They're family.
They're treated the same. We expect the same things. And we get the
same results.''
</P>
<P>
   When there are heartaches, he added, ``I look at it as a
heartache with my son, not with an adopted son. . . . Kids are
kids, and they all need a good home.'' &QL; 
WORST CASE SCENARIOS
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Sometimes a Fatal Quest,'' Kirschner talks about
kids who vent their rage in deadly ways.
</P>
<P>
   He calls it ``adopted child syndrome,'' and says it has become
``like an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner sees these adoptees he studied as victims, not just
killers. They act spontaneously, he says, following uncontrollable
impulses from childhood.
</P>
<P>
   He has testified for defendants in more than a dozen trials
involving adoptees who committed murder, and was scheduled as a
defense witness in the Strohmeyer case until a guilty plea was
lodged.
</P>
<P>
   Kirschner says the 19-year-old Californian is a case study of
adoption-related violence.
</P>
<P>
   Strohmeyer was born in a mental hospital. His mom was a drug
addict. His dad was in prison. After years as a good son and
student, he began searching for his past. He was denied information
about his biological mother. He was spurned by a girlfriend. He
resorted to drugs and booze.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this stuff kind of erupts,'' Kirschner said. ``And the
trigger mechanism is rejection.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics complain that such analysis only provides excuses
for coldblooded murder. Kirschner concedes that the ``adoption
establishment'' is outraged by his views.
</P>
<P>
   ``These killings are so horrendous that people lose sight of
understanding what's happening _ the dynamics of what caused
this,'' he says. ``Every one of them could have been prevented . .
.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the emotionality, the clinical issues become
political footballs. . . . Denying the problem will not make it go
away.'' &QL; 
High anxiety
</P>
<P>
   Researchers estimate that 2 percent of Americans _ 5 million
people _ are adopted. The National Council for Adoption says 1
million families are seeking kids. A study in 1992 counted 127,441
adoptions nationwide, about 42 percent involving stepparents or
other relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers represent a vast world of families steeped in
controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Experts are at odds over cross-racial matches, international
children and the merits of confidential placements versus open
adoptions that keep kids in contact with biological parents. And
each issue is clouded by a lack of raw data.
</P>
<P>
   Garfinkle says the so-called link between adoption and violence
is a misguided correlation, like blaming skin color for crime.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics and Blacks may be overrepresented in prisons, she
says, but that reflects socio-economic conditions _ not
pigmentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence gets headlines,'' Garfinkle said. ``But if you say,
`Here are these kids, and they might grow up to be violent,' there
are 9,000 other variables.''
</P>
<P>
   Garfinkle believes foster care, rather than adoption, is a
critical factor in violence. Historically, social workers tried to
salvage biological families at the expense of children _ taking
kids from abusive parents, bouncing them through the foster system,
preventing adoption until kids were too old or scarred to bond. &QL; 
`PRIMAL WOUNDS'
</P>
<P>
   Popular literature teems with reports on the prenatal bond of
fetus and mom. For nine months, infants identify with the
biological mother's voice, rhythm and personality.
</P>
<P>
   When that woman is replaced by someone else, says
psychotherapist Nancy Verrier, ``The baby senses that as being the
wrong mother. . . . Your whole system knows that. You may not
remember it. (But) that sets up a belief system on whether you can
or cannot trust people.''
</P>
<P>
   Verrier, who adopted a daughter, says children experience the
``primal wound'' even if they are taken from the biological mother
immediately after birth.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're angry about being abandoned,'' she said. ``They get
this uncontrollable rage. They want to strike out at somebody. You
talk to them later and they don't even know where it came from. And
a lot of times they take it out on their families. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Adoption isn't just about love. It's about growing up in a
family where you don't look like everybody, you don't talk like
everybody. You're not mirrored.''
</P>
<P>
   As kids build walls, adoptive parents struggle with their own
uncertainties. The parent-child bond flounders. And the adoptee's
crisis is magnified by guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that happens with adopted kids is they blame
themselves for their own abandonment,'' said Verrier. ``They have a
low opinion of themselves. Many feel they don't even have a right
to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Paula Pickle, executive director at the Attachment Center at
Evergreen, Colo., says this phenomenon begins with severence from
the birth mother. Some children wall off emotions to prevent more
pain, more loss. They may seem normal, even charming, but kids with
attachment disorder have closed hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are really hurting children inside,'' Pickle said.
``They don't have a clue how to love. . . . Many of the parents, by
the time they get here, are fearful of their children.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, most adoptions were closed. Records were sealed by
law. Kids could not find birth parents.
</P>
<P>
   Betty Jean Lifton, a psychologist who wrote ``Journey of the
Adopted Self,'' says she confronted that ``conspiracy of silence''
as an adopted child.
</P>
<P>
   Kids know they are different. They feel lost. But all the
questions go unanswered. And the sense of betrayal may lead to
alienation _ even from adoptive parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're living like you're in a blindfold, and some kids can't
tolerate that,'' says Lifton. ``There's a lot of anger and
aggression because they feel abandoned and rejected. When such a
person experiences loss, he can begin to unravel and,
unfortunately, become violent.'' &QL; 
LOVE'S NOT ENOUGH
</P>
<P>
   While views on violence may differ, experts unilaterally back
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of adoptees _ we're talking in the high 90s
as a percentile _ report that they are very happy with their life
situations,'' said Amy Thurston of the National Adoption
Information Clearing House in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the placements we do are like the Beaver Cleaver
family,'' agreed Sorrel Bowman-Rogers, president of Family Service
Agency in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kirschner recognizes adoption as the best alternative for
orphans or children who have been abused by birth parents. Like
many others, however, he advocates open placements with parents who
are prepared to help high-risk kids.
</P>
<P>
   Over and over, the experts warn that ``love's not enough.''
Couples need to investigate a child's medical and behavioral
background. They should evaluate their own capacity for patience,
and overcome naive notions of the perfect life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to think about, `What did happen with this child
before I took him into my family?' '' says Kathleen Moss, executive
director of the Association for Treatment and Training in the
Attachment of Children. ``Because you just can't wipe it all away
with love and good care.'' &QL;

LONGHORNS STRIKE AGAIN 'HUSKERS AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ Lightning, they say, never strikes twice in the
same place. But that does not mean it can't hit a moving target
more than once.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Longhorns proved that yesterday, pulling off their
second upset of Nebraska's defending national champs in as many
tries since joining the Big 12 Conference. This time, the 17-point
underdogs from Texas did not wrap up a league football championship
by ending the Cornhuskers' string of 47 consecutive home victories
at Memorial Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this 20-16 triumph merely kept Texas (6-2, 4-1) in the
thick of the South Division race. But it may have thrust the 1998
Heisman Trophy into the hands of tailback Ricky Williams, who
gained 150 yards and needs 294 in his remaining games to break Tony
Dorsett's NCAA career rushing record (6,082 yards).
</P>
<P>
   It definitely placed No. 7 Nebraska (7-2, 3-2) in danger of
missing out on its first trip to the Big 12 championship game since
the league was formed in 1996. It was during that inaugural title
game, played in St. Louis' Trans World Dome, when Texas first
stunned Nebraska, prevailing, 37-27, as 21-point underdogs.
</P>
<P>
   This victory, said a central figure in both victories, proved
even sweeter because it was accomplished in the Cornhuskers' own
backyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is bigger,'' said tight end Derek Lewis, who grabbed a
16-yard touchdown pass on Texas' first drive. ``We did it in a
hostile environment, when the chips were down, with a redshirt
freshman quarterback ... when absolutely no one thought we had a
chance. I'm really speechless. I'm flabbergasted right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how the Cornhuskers must feel. Two years ago, they
watched Lewis grab a game-clinching, 61-yard pass on
fourth-and-inches with 2:16 remaining. This time, they watched
quarterback Major Applewhite flip a 2-yard touchdown toss to Wane
McGarity on a broken play with 2:47 remaining to allow the
Longhorns to erase their second deficit of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there are no words to describe it,'' said Nebraska
kicker Kris Brown, a Carroll High School graduate. ``We are
disappointed. We are hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams inflicted most of the pain, rushing 37 times for 150
yards and helping Texas control the clock for 31:04. But the
critical plays belonged to Applewhite (14-of-26, 269 yards), who
threw for two touchdowns, and a Texas defense that limited Nebraska
to 4-of-15 third-down conversions and forced the game's biggest
turnover: a fumble at the Texas 4-yard line with 48 seconds
remaining in the third quarter and Nebraska in position to extend a
13-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, defensive end J.J. Kelly stripped the ball from
Nebraska quarterback Eric Crouch (17 carries, 108 yards, 1 TD) and
Donald McCowen recovered. Three plays later, Applewhite hit Bryan
White (two catches, 113 yards) for 76 yards behind fallen
cornerback Erwin Swiney to set up a tying field goal.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown's third field goal, a 42-yarder with 8:33 remaining,
gave the Cornhuskers a 16-13 lead, Applewhite found White for 37
yards on third-and-21 to keep alive the game-winning, 85-yard
touchdown march. On third-and-goal from the Nebraska 2, Applewhite
found a diving McGarity for the winning touchdown while scrambling
away from defensive end Mike Rucker.
</P>
<P>
   During a jubilant postgame celebration, Texas coach Mack Brown
pointed to Williams and said: ``I don't think there's any question
that guy just won the Heisman Trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. But the nation's leading rusher (1,634
yards, 204.3 per game), limited to 43 yards on 25 carries in a 48-7
loss to No. 4 Kansas State on Sept. 19, smiled when asked about his
performance against a rushing defense that had allowed just 106.5
yards per contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have said I don't run well against good defenses, and
today I showed that's not true,'' said Williams, who had 82 yards
on 13 carries in leading Texas to a 10-0 lead and a 146-15 edge in
total offense with 14:50 remaining in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly thereafter, Nebraska coaches benched quarterback Monte
Christo, who dropped two snaps and bobbled a third, and inserted
Crouch, who energized the Cornhuskers' offense. But it was Texas,
once again, that shocked Nebraska by becoming the first unranked
team in 20 years to win in Lincoln.
</P>
<P>
   ``People dismissed the '96 game as a fluke,'' said linebacker
Anthony Hicks, who had a team-high 13 tackles, including five for
losses. ``But to beat them here, when no one had one it since 1991,
that's really huge.''

Leader Singh makes his case
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coming into the final event of the official PGA Tour
season, the debate over Player of the Year revolved around two
players _ Mark O'Meara and David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh is trying his best to wedge his way into the
argument.
</P>
<P>
   While Singh's lead in the Tour Championship continued to shrink
Saturday, the bottom line is that it remains his tournament to lose
going into the final round today at East Lake Golf Club. Singh shot
even-par 70 on Saturday, and his 54-hole total of 7-under 203 was
good enough to keep him ahead of Hal Sutton and Jim Furyk by one
stroke. After the way he played, Singh said he feels lucky to have
any cushion left at all from the three-shot edge he enjoyed after
Day 1.
</P>
<P>
   But if he can make it last one more day, the rewards might be
even greater than the $720,000 winner's check from this $4 million
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A win would give Singh three victories in 1998, including a
major at the PGA Championship. He also won the Sprint
International, beating a tough field.
</P>
<P>
   The question would be whether Singh's ledger would stack up
against Duval's four victories (no majors) or O'Meara's two major
wins (the Masters and British Open). And, since the players vote on
the PGA Tour's Player of the Year, there's also the question of
whether Singh's style as kind of a loner on the tour might work
against him. He's not the most popular fellow among the polyester
set.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, a good day today would validate Singh as a Player
of the Year candidate, although O'Meara still appears to be the
favorite.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is sure for Singh: It's becoming painfully evident
that if anybody is going to catch him, they are going to have to do
just that _ catch him. He's not backing up. If he didn't on
Saturday, he said, he doesn't expect to today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was disappointed with the way I played (Saturday),'' Singh
said. ``But I was quite happy with the way I scored. I scored
really well to shoot even-par. I didn't play well enough to shoot
even-par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot go out there and struggle (again) and shoot par and
win. That's not the way I plan to play. I don't think I can win
doing that. I think the winning score isn't going to be 7 (under).
I think it's probably going to be 8 or 9. I'll have that in mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason for Singh's concern is that it's getting more crowded
at the top of the leader board. Sutton shot 2-under 68 on Saturday
and Furyk had a 69 as both crept within a shot. And Jesper Parnevik
played himself into contention with a 3-under 67 that left him four
shots behind Singh at 207. Justin Leonard is another stroke back
after a 68 Saturday. Nobody else is under par for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Any of the five could win today if things break right for them.
</P>
<P>
   There could have been another contender had Davis Love III not
played the final three holes in 4-over par. That sabotaged what was
a great round in the making. He had reached 3-under par after
eagling the par-5 15th before fading back to 1-over 211.
</P>
<P>
   Singh held onto the lead in spite of staggering to the finish
line Saturday. He had gotten to 8-under par with a 4-foot birdie
putt on the par-4 13th, but gave the shot back on No. 16 when he
had an unusual problem.
</P>
<P>
   He bunkered his tee shot, then hit a 3-iron into the rough near
the green. That's when the fun started because none of the marshals
could find Singh's ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw three of them looking for it and they couldn't find it,
so I figured it couldn't be very good,'' Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the marshals stepped on the ball, imbedding it.
Singh was granted a free drop, but his pitch shot left him a
10-footer for par, which he missed.
</P>
<P>
   Singh is attempting to be the first wire-to-wire winner in the
12-year history of the Tour Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton might be the biggest threat to him doing so. The winner
of the Westin Texas Open last month, Sutton has been playing well
for most of the second half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It's a far cry from the mid-'90s, when Sutton said his career
was on the verge of ending. He couldn't envision contending for the
tour's richest prize five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit rock-bottom like I hit rock-bottom, there's a lot
of steps you have to make before you can think about something like
the Tour Championship,'' Sutton said. ``I was 35 years old at that
time. I'm 40 now. You don't know what you can do. You don't know
what your body will allow you to do. I had a lot of flaws (in his
swing). You just don't play as badly and hit it as badly as I did
without having a lot of flaws.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, Sutton pulled out of the doldrums. Now, he's in
contention for what would be an astounding victory. He said he felt
like it would be difficult for anybody other than himself, Singh or
Furyk to win today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get too far away from the lead if you want
to win this tournament,'' Sutton said. ``If you're wondering about
someone coming way out of the pack with a 63 or something, I don't
see that happening because there just aren't that many birdie holes
out there.''

SANTA MONICA GRAPPLES WITH SLAYINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By   MICHAEL COIT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ This beach city was paradise for Louise
Gabriel when she married and moved from Detroit after World War II,
drawn by palm-lined streets and mountain vistas _ a safe place to
spend the rest of her life.
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, rumbling overhead was the unfamiliar sound of a
sheriff's helicopter disturbing the tranquillity of the oceanside
community.
</P>
<P>
   In the past three weeks, the sounds of police sirens and
helicopters have become all too frequent in a city that recorded
only one murder in 1997. With the murder of a German tourist in a
street holdup and four gang slayings, a wave of fear has swept the
city at a time when most communities in the Los Angeles area are
experiencing a sharp decline in crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought gangs and killings would happen here,''
Gabriel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a beautiful and very peaceful community. The
police are out there. It's reassuring in a way. You're not going to
find anything perfect. But as far as the climate and beauty, that
will never change.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, most Santa Monicans are taking it in stride and
accepting the reassurances of city officials.
</P>
<P>
   At Lincoln Park, Kellie Young was more concerned with 1-year-old
son Christopher negotiating around playground equipment than the
killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody knows about it, but they keep it on the
periphery,'' said Young, who moved to Santa Monica from
Massachusetts five years ago. ``There are those of us who live in a
bubble to a certain degree. There's always that denial. It's part
of survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica clearly has changed from the quiet, conservative,
noncommercial community founded in 1886 into a thriving city of
90,000 residents that draws more than 2 million tourists annually
and is a bustling hub of entertainment, shopping and trendy
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Parking on crowded streets and living alongside a sizable
homeless population were the few big-city problems accompanying
Santa Monica's development.
</P>
<P>
   Crime, including gang-related incidents, sank as the city
population soared this decade. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken a punch. It does give us a black eye, but we're
not going to lose this fight,'' said Mayor Bob Holbrook. ``We have
got to do the very best we can to solve these crimes and make the
city safe for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Of particular concern is the string of retaliatory slayings
between Santa Monica and Culver City gangs that shows no signs of
ending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our gang crimes are real low, so this is just totally out of
character for this community,'' said Lt. Gary Gallinot, spokesman
for the Santa Monica Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a truce. There's something more going on, and
we plan to find out what that is so that we can attack the fronts
to try and stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Police bolstered patrols by one-third beginning this past week,
leased a Pasadena police helicopter for weekend duty, and will call
on the Los Angeles sheriff's air unit as needed. Detectives and the
SMPD's special enforcement unit also are working with state parole,
county probation, and the Los Angeles and Culver City police
departments, Gallinot said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives and other officers are being deployed at junior and
senior high schools before and after school. On Halloween night,
the force was to be expanded from a normal contingent of about 50
to 176, Gallinot said.
</P>
<P>
   The overtime and helicopters together are costing the department
about $65,000 a day, but officials said it's a nominal price to
restore the peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have to go back to '91 to go into double digits (with
homicides), but one is too many,'' Gallinot said.
</P>
<P>
   The killing spree began in the 1900 block of Sixth Street on
Oct. 12, when Omar Sevilla, 22, a Culver City gang member, was
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Some two hours later, about 9:30 the same night, Horst Featz was
slain during a street holdup on Appian Way. He was to return to
Germany with his wife and another couple the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Five days later, Santa Monica gang member Juan Campos, 28, was
shot and killed inside a liquor store at 20th Street and Pico
Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 27, Michael, 27, and Anthony Juarez, 18, brothers from
San Luis Obispo County, were slain inside a Lincoln Boulevard
clothing store their cousin, who is a former Santa Monica gang
member, opened three weeks earlier. The owner and a customer were
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   There also was a gang shooting on Oct. 18 in the 1800 block of
17th Street. Javier Cruz, 25, a Santa Monica resident who was
getting into his car outside his home, was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Two Culver City teens were arrested for that incident. Marcos
Camarillo, 19, and Alex Acuna, 18, were pursued by a Santa Monica
officer who heard the shooting, and police recovered an assault
rifle, a machine pistol and a revolver. The two suspects have been
charged with attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no arrests in the gang slayings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL 2ND TAKE FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The stunning tragedy is that the individuals recently gunned
down were trying to transition away from the dangers of the gang
culture,'' said state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, a former
Santa Monica resident. ``If there is not a democratic public
commitment to ending economic and social barriers now, too many of
our youth will be unable to see beyond the bloodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica's lone gang, centered in the Pico neighborhood, has
battled three gangs from the Westside area of Los Angeles over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many of the young people on the streets, the only thing
they live for is their neighborhood,'' said Manny Lares, a Pico
neighborhood activist and representative for Santa Monica Barrios
Unidos.
</P>
<P>
   Lares, 26 and a third-generation Pico resident, contends gang
violence is a symptom of what he calls Santa Monica's most
neglected neighborhood, hard by the Santa Monica Freeway.
</P>
<P>
   A gang truce forged in 1992, which Lares said is one reason for
the city's drop in crime, ended with Sevilla's slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it coming. You can't have peace without any justice,''
he said. ``The violence is going to be solved the same way it was
before, once the young men on the streets say it's enough.''
</P>
<P>
   A founder of the local chapter of the national Barrios Unidos
movement three years ago, Lares has worked as an aide in Hayden's
office since February to help with gang and community intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time people want to do things about gangs is when it
affects them,'' Lares said. ``If the German tourist hadn't been
killed that same day as Omar Sevilla, I don't think there would be
the same attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrook, the mayor, also is a native of Santa Monica. The
56-year-old University of Southern California School of Pharmacy
instructor said community leaders are indeed concerned with
directing youths away from gangs to avert the very violence now
threatening the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their focus is to fight each other, but anytime anyone's hurt,
whether they're a gang member or not, it hurts everybody. It hurts
the community. It's a crime against all of us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Known for its historic pier, wide beach and boardwalk, the
Museum of Flying, and the Third Street Promenade and Main Street
shopping areas, Santa Monica now is drawing notice for the most
alarming of the nine homicides reported so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The attention might be unfair. There haven't been this many
murders since 1993. There was only one homicide last year. The
number of serious and violent crimes last year was the lowest in a
decade.
</P>
<P>
   But the attention nevertheless is a reminder that many imagine
Santa Monica as a safe haven from its metropolitan neighbor Los
Angeles and not ground zero for bloodshed on city streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we're concerned about the perception of Santa
Monica,'' said Dan Ehrler, executive vice president of the Santa
Monica Chamber of Commerce. ``There's a lot happening here, and
people want to be here. It's a great place to live.''
</P>
<P>
   Santa Monica's first four homicides this year went largely
unnoticed beyond the community. A woman was reported killed but her
body was never found, a teen-age girl was strangled, a body was
found in a home for sale, and a motorist was run over after a
road-rage quarrel.
</P>
<P>
   Then Featz was slain, prompting a citywide manhunt and drawing
international attention. Featz, his wife and another German couple
were approached by three men and a woman who demanded money in
front of the Loews Santa Monica Beach Hotel. The Germans apparently
didn't speak English, a struggle followed, and one of the men shot
Featz.
</P>
<P>
   Two suspects linked to the slaying were questioned and police
sought charges, but the Los Angeles County District Attorney's
Office declined to file a case citing a lack of physical evidence,
Gallinot said.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed by the German tourist's killing, Chamber of Commerce
President Jean McNeil-Wyner said it's a wake-up call that residents
and visitors alike must take precautions even in Santa Monica.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us are insulated anymore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Brentwood resident, McNeil-Wyner has worked at Santa
Monica-UCLA Medical Center the past 16 years. She said Santa Monica
is still like a small town when it comes to solving community
problems.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, she noted that business leaders and tourism
officials are meeting later this month to discuss ways to give
visitors safety tips about combing the sites and streets of Santa
Monica.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Barrios Unidos group will lead a procession along
a route where 17 youths were slain during gang shootings before the
truce. The route begins at St. Anne's Catholic Church at 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to celebrate life by remembering those who have
fallen before us,'' Lares said.

REAL ESTATE: THE PLUSES AND MINUSES OF REFINANCING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Remember when home buyers took out a mortgage and
kept it until they sold the house? Well, those days are gone.
</P>
<P>
   Now, mortgage-lending experts say, it is not unusual for even
average homeowners to refinance their mortgages one or more times
to try to get the lowest interest rate possible. But playing the
mortgage market can be tricky, and even risky, for the unwary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Refinancing can cost you thousands more than you expected,''
said Marc Eisenson, the owner of Good Advice Press, a financial
publishing company in Elizaville, N.Y. ``Before you scramble to
find a cheaper loan, you have to invest the time to weigh your
options carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisenson said that getting a new mortgage at a lower interest
rate does not always translate to real long-run savings. In fact,
Eisenson and his two co-authors, Gerri Detweiler and Nancy
Castleman, both debt counselors, devoted an entire chapter in their
book ``Invest In Yourself: Six Secrets to a Rich Life'' (Wiley,
1998) to money-saving strategies in trading in an old loan for a
new one.
</P>
<P>
   A common mistake homeowners make in refinancing a mortgage,
Eisenson said, is replacing a partly paid off 30-year mortgage with
a new mortgage for a new 30-year term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's one scenario,'' he said. ``You have 22 years left on a
30-year, $100,000 mortgage you took out eight years ago at 10
percent interest. You've made 96 monthly payments of $877.58 for a
total of $84,248 over the last eight years, but, believe it or not,
only $6,468 went to principal and a staggering $77,780 went into
your lender's pocket as interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, Eisenson said, a homeowner seeking to
refinance such a mortgage would need to borrow at least $93,532 to
pay off the balance on the existing mortgage, plus $3,000 to $5,000
for points and closing costs. And since most homeowners who
refinance to a lower rate believe they are saving a lot of money,
many will borrow a bit more than they need, to make repairs on the
house or pay other bills. As a result, Eisenson said, it is a
pretty good bet that the amount of the new mortgage will be at or
near the original amount of the old one _ $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if you refinance to another 30-year, $100,000 mortgage at
7.25 percent _ well under the traditional 2 percent rule of thumb
for refinancing _ your monthly payment will be reduced to $682,''
he said. ``But even with the lower payment, you could ultimately
end up paying more than if you had kept the original high-interest
loan in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   How?
</P>
<P>
   Eisenson explained that the total interest on the
10-percent-interest loan for the full 30-year term would be
$215,909. The interest paid on the 7.25 percent loan over a 30-year
period, of course, would be less _ $145,580. But to that amount, he
said, another $84,248 must be added to account for the interest
paid on the original loan for the first eight years. The result is
a total of $229,828 in interest payments, almost $14,000 more than
the interest that would have been paid on the original loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you stretch out the term of a loan, you dramatically
increase the interest you'll be paying,'' Eisenson said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that there are ways to avoid such a trap.
</P>
<P>
   ``One way is to shorten the term of the loan,'' he said, adding
that by refinancing the original 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan
at 7.25 percent, the monthly payment would be $912.87 -- slightly
more than the original. However, he said, the total interest on the
new loan would be only $64,314. When that is added to the $84,248
already paid on the original, the total interest costs amount to
$148,562 _ a net savings of $67,347.
</P>
<P>
   The other way to save on a refinancing, Eisenson said, is to
take out a new 30-year loan at a lower interest rate but then
continue making the same payments that were being made on the
original loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Continue to send in the same $878 each month that you were
required to send in on the original mortgage,'' Eisenson said,
``and your interest payments will amount to $69,905.'' That, when
added to the $84,248 paid on the original loan, results in a total
interest cost of $154,153, and a net savings of $61,756. In fact,
he said, by making such prepayments on a regular basis, a 30-year
mortgage will actually be paid off in just over 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   Eisenson said that both strategies ended up producing similar
savings. He prefers the latter, however, because it is typically
easier to qualify for a 30-year loan and, at the same time, a
homeowner who falls on hard times can always forgo the additional
payments if necessary. And in both cases, he said, some amount of
savings will result even if the loan is not kept for the full term.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Detweiler, one of Eisenson's co-authors, said that another
way to save money on a refinancing is to ``watch closing costs like
a hawk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing costs can boost the real cost of a loan
substantially,'' she said, explaining that since closing costs are
typically included in the amount of the refinancing, they are being
borrowed at the same rate and for the same time period as the
mortgage itself. For example, she said, $4,000 in closing costs can
end up costing a total of $9,820, including interest, if the loan
in the above example is paid to term.
</P>
<P>
   ``People can end up paying more in interest than they borrowed
in the first place,'' Ms. Detweiler said.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to cut closing costs, she said, is to negotiate as
ferociously as possible about items like points, application fees,
appraisal fees, legal fees and ``junk fees'' like commitment fees
and document processing charges.
</P>
<P>
   Oded Ben-Ami, senior loan officer for Sterling National
Mortgage, a mortgage banker based in Great Neck, N.Y., said that
contrary to the traditional notion that a refinancing doesn't make
sense unless there is at least a two-percentage-point drop in
rates, virtually any reduction in the interest rate being paid can
justify a new loan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The simple rule of thumb is that if the cost of the refinance
is going to be recovered by lower monthly payments, then the
refinance is worthwhile,'' Ben-Ami said. He added, however, that
the new mortgage must be held long enough for the savings produced
by the lower payments to fully cover the cost of the refinancing,
but not so long as to result in the problem described by Eisenson.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ben-Ami said, to address that issue, his company now
offers mortgages for whatever number of years are remaining on the
existing mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means you end up paying the lower interest rate without
extending the total term of your indebtedness,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a decision that almost every borrower faces at one
point or another is whether to lock in an interest rate before the
closing date.
</P>
<P>
   Keith T. Gumbinger, a vice president of HSH Associates, a
mortgage publishing company in Butler, N.J., explained that those
who choose to lock in their mortgage rate are betting that rates
are likely to rise, while those who choose not to are betting that
rates will fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is that trying to time the bottom of the market is
a fool's game,'' Gumbinger said, explaining that if the interest
rate being offered on a refinancing is low enough to ``make sense''
and will ultimately result in savings, it is usually prudent to
lock in the rate if possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can drive yourself crazy second-guessing the market,''
Gumbinger said. ``But if you can't afford to lose, you can't afford
to gamble.''

WEEKEND OF WORK FOR A ROUND-THE-WORLD VOYAGE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was an appropriately cold and drizzly weekend last
month for 30 would-be round-the-world sailors meeting on Thompson
Island, Mass., a 157-acre preserve in Boston Harbor. The gathering
was no picnic. Far from it.
</P>
<P>
   The three-day session of team-building exercises _ rope
swinging, tower vaulting, sailboat racing _ was being used to
decide who among them would qualify for a free berth on a
round-the-world sailboat. The event is the 2000-2001 BT Global
Challenge, a 30,000 nautical-mile race for paying clients.
</P>
<P>
   The round-trip entrance fee for this amateur race is $40,000 per
person. Being selected to sail in one of its seven legs, which the
Thompson Island foray would decide, was worth a sizable chunk of
change. But it was also worth a bite out of life, a month at sea
under potentially trying circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see it as a challenge,'' David Martin, a 42-year-old
architect from Austin, Texas, said about the prospect. ``My life so
far has been pretty much set by choice. I have done all the
politically correct things _ went to college, got married, had
kids. But this is something I want to do for myself. To be on a
sailboat in the middle of the ocean with a team like this is a
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the Thompson Island group, he had won a writing
contest sponsored by Sail magazine, a national boating publication
based in Boston. Of the 1,000 submissions Sail received, 30
individuals were chosen for their 250-word essays on why each
wanted to sail around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But writing skills were not enough to qualify. For a berth on
one of the competition's 15 identical 72-foot sailboats, an
applicant had to show a degree of tenacity, athleticism and a
strong willingness to go.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Chay Blyth, the British adventurer who organized the first
global race for amateurs in 1992-93, wanted a part in choosing the
five who would compete in his 2000-2001 race. ``At the end of the
day, there was no pass or fail,'' Blyth said Thursday in a
telephone interview from England. ``They can't all go. It's a fact
of life.''
</P>
<P>
   The steel yachts being built for their 18-man crews are designed
to be seaworthy. They have to be. The competition, which begins
Sept. 8, 2000, in Southampton, England, follows the world's oceans
from east to west, against the prevailing westerly winds. Blyth
followed the same course in 1970-71 when he became the first person
to sail nonstop alone around the world in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth interviews every race applicant, and people with money in
hand aren't guaranteed a berth unless they can pass muster with
Blyth. Many of the Sail magazine choices had some yachting
experience, but it wasn't a prerequisite. Still, nothing could
prepare the applicants for their Oct. 10-12 excursion at the
Thompson Island Outward Bound Education Center for inner city
adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all about team leadership and working together,'' said
Gary Rothman, a 38-year-old veterinarian from Jamesville, N.Y..
``Sailing had really nothing to do with it.'' In the end, Rothman
wasn't among the four men and one woman chosen. But he said the
weekend was worthwhile anyway because of the people he met.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was among the five Thompson Island candidates selected
for a free berth, as was James Wilkins Jr., a 39-year-old
physician's assistant from Panama City, Fla. He was surprised at
being chosen, given the short interview he had with Blyth in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He basically asked me if I was married, had children, and what
my wife thought about me wanting to play around with boats,''
Wilkins said. ``But I also noticed on the island that he kind of
walked around and watched.''
</P>
<P>
   Blyth filled up all the other available slots for the 2000-2001
race two years ago, and has a waiting list of more than 250 people.
But last month he announced another circumnavigation _ the New
World Challenge. The round-the-world competition will be the first
to start in the United States. Its San Francisco departure is
scheduled for the spring of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The 24,500-mile route, also an east-to-west passage, will
include stops in Japan, China, South Africa and Brazil. The fleet
consists of 10 identical 67-foot steel sailboats, each with a crew
of 14, including a professional skipper. A full-berth costs $44,850
for the 10-month voyage. Blyth said that 30 people have signed up
so far; 80 crew positions are left. To apply, phone the Challenge
office in Boston at (617) 723-7245.

No. 16 Notre Dame overwhelms Baylor 27-3
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DANNY ROBBINS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ Before they faced Notre Dame on Saturday, Baylor
players were treated to a pep talk from Mike Singletary, the former
Baylor linebacker who went on to make the Pro Football Hall of Fame
as a member of the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Singletary's presence guaranteed that Baylor would win the
battle of the alumni celebrities _ the best Notre Dame could do
Saturday was Regis Philbin _ and that the Bears would be inspired
when they took the field at Notre Dame Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really got me jumping, ready to play,'' free safety Nikia
Codie said. ``I wish he'd do that more often.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe next time Singletary will show the current generation
of Baylor players how he used to fight off blocks and wrap up
ball-carriers.
</P>
<P>
   With tailback Autry Denson cutting a wide swath through the
Baylor defense, Notre Dame whipped the Bears 27-3, scoring 24
unanswered points after the teams were tied 3-3 early in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The loss means Baylor (2-6) has lost three of the four games
coach Dave Roberts dubbed ``Bloody October,'' with fourth-ranked
Kansas State up next.
</P>
<P>
   Denson rushed for 189 yards, 169 coming in the first half. The
189-yard game was a career best for Denson, a senior from
Lauderhill, Fla., and ranks as the 11th best single-game total in
Notre Dame history.
</P>
<P>
   More telling than the numbers was the way Denson sprinted
virtually untouched into the Baylor secondary, a testimonial to how
Notre Dame's big, veteran offensive line dominated the Bears'
defensive front.
</P>
<P>
   ``It came down to our defensive linemen staying on their blocks
instead of getting off their blocks,'' Baylor linebacker Kenyada
Parker said. ``They (Notre Dame) have some pretty good offensive
linemen. They'd sustain their blocks. If you don't get off your
block, the hole is big. I mean, real big.''
</P>
<P>
   For 16th-ranked Notre Dame (6-1), the one low moment was a
floater of a halfback pass by Denson early in the second half. The
throw, intended for quarterback Jarious Jackson, was intercepted by
Baylor cornerback Gary Baxter and returned 59 yards, leading to the
Bears' only score _ Matt Bryant's 18-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Baylor offense, it opened the game with three
illegal-procedure penalties on its first series and went down from
there. The Bears netted a total of 33 yards rushing on 38 tries and
finished with 172 yards in total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you make those kinds of mistakes, you're in
trouble,'' Roberts said. ``We're not very good. A lot has to do
with the people we're playing. But we can't do that (make
mistakes). We don't overcome first-and-15 very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor's only real sign of a pulse came after Denson's two-yard
run had staked Notre Dame to a 10-3 lead with 4:47 left in the
first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears seemed to have found their legs when Jermaine Alfred,
throwing on second-and-five at the Baylor 47-yard line, connected
with Derrius Thompson on an apparent 25-yard gain, with Thompson
making a nice catch on the sideline at the Irish 28. But Thompson
was judged to have juggled the ball, making the pass incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, the Bears were forced to punt, and the Irish
quickly tacked on another score. First came two carries by Denson _
37 yards up the middle, seven off tackle. Then Jackson threw 24
yards to Malcolm Jackson for the touchdown that gave Notre Dame a
17-3 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although the call on Thompson's catch had Roberts barking at the
officials _ a Big 12 Conference crew _ in the final minutes of the
half, he declined to comment later except to say it represented ``a
14-point swing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Irish pushed their lead to 24-3 two plays into their first
possession of the second half when Jackson, his play-action fake
catching the Bears off balance, found Bobby Brown for a 66-yard
scoring play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our safety busted,'' Roberts said. ``Good call on their
part.''
</P>
<P>
   Denson set the tone for the game on his first carry, popping
into the middle of the Baylor defense and going 32 yards to the
Bears' 29. The Irish were stalled at that point only because
Denson, taking a pitch from Jackson, fumbled the ball away after a
hit from Baylor cornerback Robert Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe all the credit to the offensive line and my fullbacks,
for the way they blocked,'' Denson said. ``Those guys were getting
me into the secondary almost every time I ran the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said the previous two weeks _ losses to Texas A&AMP;M and
Texas _ had taken a toll on his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Texas game last week, we gave them (players) Monday
off, didn't even practice,'' he said. ``We said, `They're
emotionally spent.' We've played some pretty good football teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are spent. Not physically spent. They're emotionally
drained. We'll be better down the road because of this schedule,
playing these people week to week, but it's not happening right
now.''

MORGAN'S CHALLENGERS WANT LEAD ROLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They'll shoot it out for the championship of the
Pacific Bell Senior Classic today at Wilshire Country Club, hard by
the shadow of nearby Paramount Studios and with a lead cast bearing
a distinctively Hollywood flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Tied for first place is Joe Inman, the ebullient senior rookie
who cherishes family above golf, hopes only to retain his values
and seems a combination of the James Stewart character in ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' and, well, Gomer Pyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gollleeee, these greens are fast,'' said Inman, after
negotiating six of them for birdies Saturday during a round of
3-under-par 68 that left him 134, tied with two-time defending
champion Gil Morgan (also 68) for the lead.
</P>
<P>
   They'll join indomitable George Archer in today's final group,
Archer qualifying with a 66 that left him 136 and again underscored
the marvels of modern medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove the ball nicely and was patient,'' said Archer, whose
second reference may have been about his life as well as his game.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, the senior tour's equivalent of a cyborg, has steel rods
in his back, an artificial hip and a history of seven major
operations _ which also have affected his knee, shoulder and wrist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been cut on more than a piece of meat,'' said Archer, who
brings to mind the character from ``Little Big Man:'' an arm
missing in one scene, a peg leg evident in the next, an eye patch
after that...
</P>
<P>
   But Archer also did a nice job of carving up 6,575-yard, par-71
Wilshire in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   He rammed home five birdies without a bogey on quick, subtly
sloping greens that had most of the field muttering under its
collective breath _ or to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could that go straight,'' howled a frustrated Lee Trevino
after watching his birdie bid slide past the cup on No.18 and come
to rest less than a foot from the hole _ from where Trevino missed
again.
</P>
<P>
   So it went for most of a field that struggled regularly with the
fastest greens the tour has played this year _ as fast as Augusta
National, in the view of some.
</P>
<P>
   Only 22 players broke 70, but Morgan, Inman and Archer coped,
holding their own against the course and holding off some talented
pursuit. Hubert Green and Ed Dougherty shared fourth at 137, and
Bobby Stroble, Allen Doyle, Trevino and Brian Barnes were next at
138 and Raymond Floyd another stroke back in a four-way tied at
139.
</P>
<P>
   For Morgan, coped might be an understatement. Even on a day he
said he never felt comfortable with his game, he managed his eighth
consecutive round in the 60s at Wilshire.
</P>
<P>
   Senior tour officials do not keep records of consecutive rounds
in the 60s in the same tournament, but Trevino holds the tour
record for consecutive rounds in the 60s at 11, and that puts
Morgan's accomplishment in some perspective.
</P>
<P>
   But, ``I never had my ball in position to make a run at it,'' is
the way Morgan saw his situation on Saturday. ``I just seemed to be
sneaking up on it all day.''
</P>
<P>
   He sneaked himself into four birdies, including a 10-footer on
the final hole to grab a share of the lead when Inman made his
third bogey of an otherwise impeccable round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe played really well on the front side,'' Morgan said of
Inman, who entered this tournament needing a win to assure himself
of a full-time tour card next year. ``He's had a whole year to play
and now he's as good as he's going to get _ for this year, at
least.''
</P>
<P>
   Inman, who was out of competitive golf for several years before
joining the senior tour, went into this tournament $96,000 shy of
the current No.31 money spot needed to secure his 1999 tour card.
Then, he got a reality check from daughter Sally Anne when he
phoned her to wish her a happy 12th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   She told him that even if senior tour money leader Hale Irwin
had $2 million less than the $2.5 million he has earned this year,
Irwin would ``still have more than you, daddy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave it to your children to make sure you know where you
stand,'' said Inman. He seems secure in that knowledge and of where
he wants to remain, and it has nothing to do any game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a wonderful life outside of golf,'' he said. ``I have
wonderful children and am married to the greatest lady in the
world. This (tournament) is like icing on the cake for me.''

PRINCETON BEATS COLUMBIA, 20-0  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM N. WALLACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Princeton kept its share of first place in the Ivy
League with an easy 20-0 victory over Columbia Saturday at Wein
Stadium in Manhattan. The Tigers, Harvard and Pennsylvania remained
tied, each with a 3-1 league record and each with three games
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The next vital game is Penn at Princeton on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   For the Lions, who were playing on the 10th anniversary of a
home victory over Princeton that ended Columbia's infamous 44-game
losing streak, there was little to celebrate. Columbia lost for the
fifth time in seven games and for the fourth time in a row, and
failed to score for the second time in its last three games. Its
Ivy League record is 1-3.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton, 4-3 over all, has struggled for its successes and did
so again Saturday. The Tigers wrapped up the triumph with 17 points
in the second period, one of the two touchdowns coming from a
blocked punt.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Sierk kicked field goals of 36 and 26 yards, the second one
coming in the fourth quarter. Sierk is now two short of the Ivy
League career record for field goals of 38, set by Dartmouth's Dave
Regula last season.
</P>
<P>
   Led by linebackers Paul Roland and Kevin Wright, the Columbia
defense was admirable but overexposed, being on the field for 38
minutes. Roland had a notable performance with 11 tackles and 4
assists, and two of the five sacks of the Princeton quarterback,
John Burnham.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Tiger defenders were strong too in a contest
short on anticipation, anxiety or big plays. The shutout was
Princeton's third this season, the most for the Tigers since 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ``We counted on our defense again,'' said Steve Tosches, the
Princeton coach. ``We struggled on offense and penalties hurt us.
That's why there were only 20 points on the board.'' The Tigers
were penalized six times for 71 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The key play was the blocked punt by Rocky Fittizzi, the strong
safety who has seven in his Princeton career and notched his second
of the season. ``He's got a knack,'' Tosches said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time this season that Columbia's Ryan Kiernan
had a punt blocked. Kiernan set a school record by averaging 50
yards a kick against Yale last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Brian grabbed the bouncing ball at the 3-yard line and ran
to the end zone for the touchdown and, soon, a 14-0 lead. ``That
play got them reeling,'' Tosches said of the Lions.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia's quarterbacks, Ted Schroeder and, in the second half,
Paris Childress, were sacked six times. When those losses (45
yards) were accounted for, Columbia's net rushing yards came to
minus-2. The Tigers outgained the Lions over all, 397 yards to 105.
</P>
<P>
   Childress, the Lions' regular quarterback, returned after
missing three games with a foot fracture. He completed 6 of 17 pass
attempts after Schroeder was 3 for 13 in the first half. The two
were constantly harassed; the Lions have given up 23 sacks in the
last four games. &QL;

Texas ends Nebraska's home winning streak
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LINCOLN, Neb. _ After they were beaten soundly at UCLA in the
second game of the season, the Texas Longhorns appeared to be in
dire straits.
</P>
<P>
   Following a mauling at Kansas State the next week, they were all
but declared dead. The only life left for the team was its star
running back's hope of winning the Heisman Trophy, but even that
was in critical condition after the Wildcats held him to just 43
yards on 25 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Five games later, the Longhorns, their season and Ricky
Williams' Heisman bid are alive and well.
</P>
<P>
   All were thriving, in fact, after Texas stunned No. 7 Nebraska
for the second time in less than two years with a 20-16 win
Saturday before a red-clad sellout crowd of 76,434 at Memorial
Stadium. The loss snapped the Cornhuskers' 47-game home winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so much further ahead of where I thought we would be,''
UT coach Mack Brown said. ``I walked out at halftime at UCLA
wondering if we'd win a game. I'm serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am absolutely thrilled with this win. Words are hard to
express for your kids when you come into a place like Lincoln (and
win).''
</P>
<P>
   With its fifth consecutive win, Texas (6-2) became bowl-eligible
and remained in the chase for the Big 12 South Division title with
a 4-1 conference mark.
</P>
<P>
   Williams bolstered his Heisman chances with a 150-yard rushing
performance against a defense that came in allowing just 106.5
yards per game on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing that we did was come in here to win the
ballgame,'' Williams said. ``We didn't come to get a moral victory
or to play a good game. We came to win, and we believed that we
would win. That's the reason we beat them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fact that we won the game helps (the Heisman
campaign) more than anything else. I'm on a winning team, and that
makes my chances of winning the Heisman a little bit better. People
had said that I don't run well against good defenses, and I think
that I showed them today that that's not true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns showed a lot as a team, picking up a win over the
heavily favored Cornhuskers for the second straight time. In the
1996 Big 12 Championship Game, Texas ended the Cornhuskers' 31-game
winning streak in conference games with a 37-27 upset.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, it was Texas' swarming defense and a classic
15-play, 85-yard touchdown drive _ culminated by Wane McGarity's
two-yard catch with just under three minutes left _ that ended
Division I's fifth-longest home winning streak ever.
</P>
<P>
   Major Applewhite, Texas' freckled-faced redshirt freshman
quarterback, continued to play like a veteran, completing four
passes to account for 62 of the yards in the crucial drive. For the
day, Applewhite was 14-of-26 for 269 yards and two touchdowns, with
completions to six different receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite connected with Ryan Nunez on a quick look to the
right and with McGarity on a similar pattern to the left for a pair
of first downs that jump-started the game-winning trek.
</P>
<P>
   A sack and an incompletion left Texas facing third-and-21 from
its 35 before Applewhite hit Bryan White along the right sideline
for 37 yards to keep the drive going.
</P>
<P>
   White beat cornerback Erwin Swiney twice during the game for a
career-high 113 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Brown was flagged for a 15-yard facemask penalty trying to
stop Williams, moving Texas to the Nebraska 13. A pair of Williams
runs got the Longhorns within inches of a first down just outside
the three, and Applewhite's sneak set up first-and-goal.
</P>
<P>
   Williams gained two yards, then lost one, leaving Texas facing
third-and-goal.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite took over from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a choice of two plays, and (the coaches) asked me which
one I wanted to run, and I chose the rollout,'' Applewhite said.
``I was trying to go to Kwame (Cavil), but he couldn't get free
outside. I was going to throw it away and just settle for the field
goal to tie the game, but at the last second I saw Wane, and I knew
if I threw it quickly, he would either make a great catch or it
would fall incomplete.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity followed his cue, lunging for the soft flip pass that,
according to McGarity, ``hung in the air waaaaay too long. I just
knew it was going to be intercepted.''
</P>
<P>
   The 195-pound Applewhite never saw the catch since he was driven
into the turf by 6-6, 260-pound lineman Mike Rucker just after
releasing the ball. Applewhite suffered a concussion on the play.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger headache belonged to the Cornhuskers, who got a
22-yard run by Dan Alexander on first down of their next possession
to move to their 45.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Hicks broke through on a blitz to bring Alexander down
for a four-yard loss on the next play, and Shevin Wiggins followed
with an eight-yard reception. Consecutive incompletions turned the
ball over to the Longhorns on downs with 1:58 left.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks and fellow linebacker Dusty Renfro proved problematic for
the Cornhuskers all day, spending almost as much time in their
backfield as did the Nebraska running backs.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks was in on 13 tackles _ five for losses, including two
sacks. Renfro had 10 stops with a sack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't blitzing on every play, but it might have looked
like it,'' Hicks said. ``We just had some packages we wanted to
bring to stop the run and force them to throw. When we forced them
to throw, we wanted to put the pressure on.''
</P>
<P>
   The only Cornhusker able to gain any yards was quarterback Eric
Crouch, who replaced ineffective starter Monte Christo in the
second quarter and rushed for 129 yards on 17 carries.

Column: Williams, Applewhite leave sea of red pale
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. _ Saturday, the day of the dead, the Texas
Longhorns showed they are back from same. Leaving Nebraska's
Cornhuskers with a very hollow(ween) feeling, the 'Horns pulled off
their grandest victory since well, shucks, since the last time they
hooked the 'Huskers.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine. It's UT 2, NU 0 since December 1996 and, come to think
of it, it's also Texas 2, NU 0 in 1998 _ lest anyone dare forget
the Aggies' bewitching upset of the 'Huskers a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Naively confident, perhaps in no small part because of what the
Ags had done to Nebraska down College Station way, the Longhorns
strode into permanently sold-out Memorial Stadium, shrugged off the
temptation to go limp in the knees when confronted by such a vast
sea of red and instead screamed, as loud as they could, ``BOO!''
</P>
<P>
   The 'Huskers' reply? First, boo-boos, then ultimately boohoos.
</P>
<P>
   Spooky.
</P>
<P>
   Improbable 20-16 winners, the 16{-point under-Steers delivered
all the tricks on Tom Osborne Field this cold, gray day, and thus
they left with all the treats, too, not the least of which figures
to be a certain piece of shiny hardware for Ricky Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Williams ran for 150 difficult yards against one of college
football's storied programs, and he did it on regional TV. With
three weeks to go, the Heisman Trophy is now his to lose, and such
a loss seems impossible to fathom unless the folks who decide
suddenly become zombies.
</P>
<P>
   Did I say spooky? For all the hammering he did at the 'Huskers'
brutish defenders, the most important play Williams made might have
been a tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Major Applewhite, the unassuming quarterback who looks as though
he should be majoring in English lit, threw one truly bad pass
among the 26 he attempted. It was intercepted by Ralph Brown at the
Texas 29 and returned to the Longhorns' 12 before Ricky popped him
out of bounds, possibly saving a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The 'Huskers, leading 13-10 at the time and building momentum
with every snap, never did score there. Redshirt freshman
quarterback Eric Crouch, inserted into the game after Nebraska
concluded it couldn't count on Monte Christo to adequately sub for
injured starter Bobby Newcombe, fumbled away the ball at the
'Horns' 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Best back in the country,'' coach Mack Brown said of Williams,
who is indeed.
</P>
<P>
   And should he also be up for the Butkus Award?
</P>
<P>
   Before I forget, Applewhite earned a promotion. Stars for the
rosy-cheeked young man's epaulets. He will answer to General
Applewhite after he found a way to rally Texas from an early
fourth-quarter deficit and steal a game in an inhospitable place
where only the Big Red Machine had prevailed in 47 previous starts.
</P>
<P>
   First, Applewhite took Texas 93 yards to a tying field goal with
13:38 left. Then, after Nebraska had gone back in front with a
field goal, Applewhite dragged the 'Horns 85 yards, finishing that
junket himself with under three minutes remaining by flipping a
two-yard sprintout pass to Wane McGarity through a maze of
'Huskers.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in Nebraska scarlet expected Williams to get the
football there, and the 'Horns had set up Kwame Cavil to be the
hero. But Ricky went into motion left and the 'Huskers froze just
long enough to create a hole in the defense on the right side of
the end zone. Although they covered Kwame, McGarity deftly ferreted
out an opening.
</P>
<P>
   ``A great call by Greg,'' Brown said, extending kudos to his
offensive coordinator, Greg Davis. ``And a great play by Major.''
</P>
<P>
   General, Mack. General.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, for his trouble, suffered a minor concussion on the
play. Later, he had trainers on both arms helping him to the
dressing room, but he politely had refused to leave until the game
ended and he could be certain the 'Horns had won.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his addled state, Applewhite wanted to see it for
himself. Can't blame him. Folks don't beat Nebraska at Nebraska
often. It hadn't happened since Washington visited in September
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is, though, we kept waiting for the Longhorns to turn back
into the same pumpkins who lost to powerhouses UCLA and Kansas
State by a combined 97-38 score on consecutive September weekends.
The same pumpkins Brown feared ``wouldn't win a game all year''
when he staggered back out after halftime trailing the Bruins 35-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm amazed at how far we've come,'' Brown said. ``To be 6-2
and now bowl eligible it's really beyond my wildest expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the 'Huskers, Nebraska at 7-2 is in a catastrophic state,
relative to the usual level of expectations in these parts. Osborne
knew what he was doing when he retired after this past season's
undefeated run produced a share of the national championship.
</P>
<P>
   Seems Frank Solich's first team really isn't very good. It lacks
offensive punch _ Crouch was pretty much a one-man band, gaining
108 of the 'Huskers' 194 rushing yards _ and the defense is nothing
special, either, although it did bottle up Williams more
effectively than his final numbers would indicate.
</P>
<P>
   But don't bother harping on the 'Huskers' shortcomings to the
Longhorns. They think they did something important Saturday, and
who's to argue? When the 'Huskers' loyal legions are left looking
like they've all seen the same ghost, it's hard to quibble.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' Williams said, ``was probably the most fun I've ever
had playing a football game.''

A DAY OF UNCERTAINTIES FINDS SINGH STILL AHEAD  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was another unusual day at the Tour Championship,
the kind when nobody knew what would happen next.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, pulling a Halloween prank, wore an Afro wig to the
first tee, much to the gallery's delight. Vijay Singh ended the day
still leading the tournament, despite shooting even par for the
second consecutive day. Hal Sutton, who sank to 109th on the PGA
Tour money list two years ago, remained in position for what would
be an inspirational victory. And Jim Furyk, one of golf's most
consistent players, survived a wild round that featured six birdies
and five bogeys to remain in the hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into a final round that should be dramatic and
unpredictable, Singh was the leader at seven under par for the
tournament (203), one stroke ahead of Sutton and Furyk. Sutton shot
a solid 68 Saturday, while Furyk had a roller-coaster 69, taking
the lead briefly, then making three consecutive bogeys and then
regrouping.
</P>
<P>
   While Singh still held the lead, he was hardly comfortable.
There will be no comfort zone at East Lake Golf Club until somebody
safely holds the trophy and the $720,000 first-place check.
Momentum can shift quickly here, where the potential for a bogey is
never more than a hole away. All five players who remained under
par, including Jesper Parnevik in fourth place (three under) and
Justin Leonard in fifth (two under) had a chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot go out there and struggle and shoot even par and
win,'' said Singh, who had two birdies and two bogeys Saturday and
struggled with his driver, missing eight fairways. ``That's not the
way I plan to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday was a good round. Today was a struggle. I just hope
I go out there tomorrow and play a little better than I did today.
If I can do that, I think I have a good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the top five players on the leader board all had a chance,
including Parnevik and Leonard, who shot themselves back into the
hunt with impressive third rounds. Parnevik's 67 was the low round
of the day, while Leonard's 68 put him in a familiar position.
Within the past two years, Leonard has won the British Open, the
Kemper Open and the Players Championship in comeback fashion.
</P>
<P>
   For Sutton, a victory would be his biggest since winning the PGA
Championship in 1983. Back then, Sutton was a young star on the
tour carrying great expectations. Fifteen years later, he has
overcome difficult times to return as one of the tour's better
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped that one day I'd be able to play this way again,''
said Sutton, who had four birdies and two bogeys Saturday. ``When I
was at rock bottom, though, that seemed like an awful long way
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 40 years old now. You don't know what you can do, what
your body will allow you to do. But when when I won the Westin
Texas Open this year, that meant a lot to me, to realize that I
could feel the pressure and win a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone near the lead will feel the pressure Sunday, but Woods,
who started Saturday in last place, was in a playful mood. It was
Woods' best day of the tournament. He finally broke par (shooting
69), finally made a birdie and finally gave himself something to
smile about.
</P>
<P>
   It's Halloween,'' he said. ``You've got to have some fun with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday was not so relaxing for the leaders, who sometimes
found themselves in difficult spots. On No. 16, Singh's approach
shot landed in deep rough near the green, and a marshal
accidentally stepped on Singh's ball. Singh was awarded a free
drop, but he eventually bogeyed the hole. ``I saw them trying to
look for the ball, and I knew it couldn't be very good, because
three of them couldn't find it,'' Singh said.
</P>
<P>
   Furyk took a brief one-stroke lead after he birdied the ninth
hole, but he bogeyed the next three holes before regrouping to keep
Singh close.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday should bring even more excitement. And after winning
both the PGA Championship and the Sprint International this year,
Singh hoped he could add another title to his most successful year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there before,'' Singh said of handling Sunday
pressure. ``But anybody can shoot a good number tomorrow. I think
the winning score is going to be eight or nine under. I'll have
that in mind, and keep the leader board in sight.''

IN NEW CHALLENGE TO U.N., IRAQ HALTS ARMS MONITORING  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to refine, update, add U.S. reaction)   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In its most serious challenge to the United
Nations in more than a year of intermittent crises, Iraq said
Saturday that it was ending all cooperation with international arms
inspectors and would close their long-term monitoring operations
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The action, announced in Baghdad after a meeting of President
Saddam Hussein and his top advisers, goes beyond even the Iraqi ban
on spot inspections imposed since August and in effect bars almost
all surveillance of Iraq's weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's representative at the United Nations, Nizar Hamdoon,
added in an interview with reporters Saturday that Baghdad assumed
that the arms inspectors would now leave Iraq. There are more than
100 inspectors and scientific experts with their support staff in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll have to be pulled out,'' Hamdoon said. ``That's
implied in the statement.'' He said inspectors would have no
further access to any monitoring sites. Several U.N. officials and
diplomats said Iraq seemed to be trying to force inspectors to
leave on their own, stopping short of expelling them.
</P>
<P>
   The Security Council later unanimously condemned the Iraqi
decision, describing it as a ``flagrant violation'' of council
resolutions and the agreement on access reached in February with
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
   The council said in its statement that Iraq must rescind its
decision and ``resume immediate, complete and unconditional
cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, President Clinton called a meeting of the
National Security Council. Afterward, David C. Leavy, a spokesman
for the council, said security advisers were ``reviewing all
options with the president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq's action cannot be tolerated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the seriousness with which the administration views
the Iraqi action, Secretary of Defense William Cohen postponed a
tour of Asia on Saturday, announcing during a refueling stop on
Wake Island in the Pacific that he would return to Washington to
take part in deliberations instead of continuing to Japan, South
Korea and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Annan's special envoy to Iraq, Prakash Shah, was on his way back
to Baghdad Saturday night to assess the situation, diplomats said.
In New York, Charles Duelfer, deputy executive chairman of the
commission formed to disarm Iraq, said the inspectors would stay
where they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got our full complement of staff,'' Duelfer told
reporters. ``We're prepared to do the work that we would like to
finish there, and our people are in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the U.S. delegate, who takes over on Sunday as
the Security Council president for November, called the Iraqi move
``a very serious development'' as he and Britain's representative,
Sir Jeremy Greenstock, arrived for the hastily summoned council
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq said it had decided to stop all inspections in response to
a Security Council decision on Friday to reject its demands that a
proposed ``comprehensive review'' of its relations with the United
Nations should more or less automatically lead to a lifting of
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected more support in the Security Council,'' Hamdoon
said. He described as especially regrettable pre-emptive American
comments that the broad assessment of its position sought by Iraq
was not a route to ending the embargo, a step that could only come
later through a regular sanctions review.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's friends on the council have not been outspoken on
Baghdad's behalf. France, which has been supportive of Iraq, said
in Paris Saturday morning that it ``deeply deplores'' the decision
and called on Baghdad to resume cooperation immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was making excuses for Iraq today,'' a Western diplomat
said after the council meeting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The headquarters of the U.N. operations in Iraq is a
high-technology hub constructed in a former hotel school at the
edge of Baghdad. There, experts view film from remote video cameras
trained on Iraqi factories and other production and storage sites,
and scientists analyze a battery of air, water and soil sensors and
samplers.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring operations were set up in Iraq in the years after
the end of the Persian Gulf war in 1991 and were intended to remain
in place even after a lifting of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqi announcement Saturday indicated that those
surveillance tools would be rendered largely useless if inspectors
would not be able to maintain, service or, for the first time, even
operate them.
</P>
<P>
   The initial Iraqi announcement said that only the International
Atomic Energy Agency would be allowed to operate in Iraq, and only
in nonintrusive monitoring without spot inspections.
</P>
<P>
   In their announcement Saturday, the Iraqis renewed their demand
for the dismissal of Richard Butler, the Australian arms control
expert who is executive chairman of the U.N. Special Commission
charged with disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis also demanded that the commission, known as Unscom,
should not have access to information collected by the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The commission had routinely
combined the agency's data with its own in reports to the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The joint meeting decided to halt all kinds of dealing with
the Special Commission and its chief, and stop all their activities
in Iraq, including the monitoring, starting from today,'' the Iraqi
statement broadcast in Baghdad said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials have been threatening a boycott of the
commission since repeated crises over access for arms inspectors
began in the fall of 1997, when the expulsion of American
inspectors led to a withdrawal of all monitors for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi officials have also said in interviews that it takes a
crisis to attract the attention of Washington and the United
Nations to Iraq's complaints that eight years of sanctions have
destroyed its economy, caused civilians to suffer and produced no
proof of prohibited arms.
</P>
<P>
   Commission officials counter that while the phase of destruction
of arms stockpiles may be over, inspectors still have much
documentation to complete on the scale of past programs, so they
can be certain that everything has been accounted for.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Saddam has evidently been emboldened in his
resistance to inspections by two developments: the failure of the
United States to gain much support for another military
confrontation with Iraq and the visit of Annan to Baghdad in
February.
</P>
<P>
   That visit was followed by the opening of new diplomatic links
between his office and the Iraqi government that bypassed the
Security Council and reduced the arms commission's influence.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by Russia, France and to some degree China, as well as
some rotating council members, Saddam has pushed for a lifting of
sanctions, in particular the oil embargo.
</P>
<P>
   When the United States, backed by Britain, Japan and others,
proved capable of blocking those moves, Iraq reacted in August by
halting on-site inspections, and soon began interfering with
monitoring activities.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a unified Security Council decided, to Baghdad's
dismay, to end regular sanctions reviews, in effect keeping Iraq
under an embargo indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq then shifted to demands for a wide-ranging review of all
its relations with the United Nations, conducted by the
secretary-general, as another way of getting sanctions lifted. On
Friday, that move also failed when the Security Council, again
unanimously, said that it would supervise the review, but that
first inspections had to be operating normally. And there were no
promises about lifting sanctions.

FOR PRICE, LIFE ISN'T THE PITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA _ When Paul Tracy pulls his Team KOOL Green racer into
the pits during today's Marlboro 500 at California Speedway,
Northridge product Steve Price will be jumping over the wall to
change his left-front tire.
</P>
<P>
   Price, 35, a 1980 Monroe High School grad who now lives near
Indianapolis, is the second mechanic on Tracy's car. He got into
auto racing after spending the early days of his career as an
aerospace machinist at Rocketdyne in Canoga Park and Sheffield
Manufacturing in Simi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Price's first paying job in racing came in 1994 when he was
asked to be the mechanic for a Sports Car Club of America team that
went on to win an amateur championship. Soon after, he was on the
phone with A.J. Foyt, who contracted him to work on his CART team.
</P>
<P>
   He's been with one CART team or another ever since, coming to
Team KOOL Green this past season.
</P>
<P>
   Price said he has no regrets about his career choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, it seemed kind of odd to go from aerospace to race
cars,'' he said. ``I didn't honestly think I would go this far with
it. But now it's my life and I wouldn't trade it.''
</P>
<P>
   Price said he and the rest of the crew have developed a special
bond with Tracy.
</P>
<P>
   As a front wheel man, Price is already kneeled on the ground
ready to work when Tracy comes roaring toward him and stops just
short of hitting him.
</P>
<P>
   As a driver, Tracy depends on Price's skill to keep him safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never forget that some 29-year-old kid is going to climb in
this car, I'm going to strap him in and he's going to drive 240
mph,'' Price said. ``You have to believe in one another and that's
what makes this team so special.''
</P>
<P>
   Indy Lights: Pasadena's Mark Hotchkis won the Indy Lights race.
</P>
<P>
   Early on in the event, racers Oriol Servia and Sergio Paese
collided, Servia's racer going airborne over the top of Paese and
into the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Neither racer was hurt, but the two ended up sparring
NASCAR-style in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Driver Brian Cunningham was slightly hurt in the accident when
he was hit in the head by flying debris. The impact cracked his
driving helmet and Cunningham had to leave the race to be checked
by track medical officials. He was fine, but had a severe headache.
</P>
<P>
   Paese was fined $10,000 and suspended from the Indy Lights
series for a year as a result of the incident. The severity of the
punishment was required because Paese was already on probation for
earlier infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Etc: Grandstand tickets were still available Saturday night for
today's race.... For the second straight year, Valencia CART driver
Bryan Herta held the winning key in a contest among CART pole
winners. Herta won an E-430 Sport Mercedes Benz.... Four-time Indy
500 champ Rick Mears will be the grand marshal for today's race.
