<HEADLINE> French Soldier Wounded by Explosion in Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A French IFOR soldier was
wounded today in an explosion while patrolling on foot in the
Sarajevo suburb of Dobrinja.
</P>
<P>
Tanjug news agency quoted IFOR commander Tom Moyere as saying
the soldier was wounded in an ankle. It was still unclear if he
was hurt by a mine or an unexploded shell.
</P>
<P>
This was the fifth casualty suffered by the IFOR since it took
over the Bosnian peace mission from the United Nations two weeks
ago. Two Britons and an American have already been wounded by mine
explosions and an Italian has been shot in the arm by a deliberate
fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a building housing British contingent in Mrkonjic
Grad in western Bosnia was destroyed by a fire but no IFOR soldier
was injured.
</P>
<P>
IFOR spokesman Lt. Col. David Shaw said the cause of the fire
was not known yet.

<HEADLINE> Yemen, Eritrea Accept Ethiopia's Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said here today that both Yemen and Eritrea have
accepted Ethiopia's Proposal on the disputed Hanish Islands.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian minister made the announcement when he returned
home from Asmara, Eritrea, where he had discussions with Eritrean
leaders on solutions to the Hanish Islands crisis.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the proposal offered by the Ethiopian
government has enjoyed acceptance from both sides, adding that
Eritrea and Yemen are positively responding to the question of
troop withdrawal from the disputed Red Sea islands.
</P>
<P>
"Eritrea and yemen will declare their positions within the
coming three days after analysing the peace initiative proposed
by Ethiopia," the minister declared.
</P>
<P>
However, details have yet to be worked out on which country
should pull out first before a second phase of the mediation can
be introduced, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian minister flew to Eritrea on Thursday following a
similar mission to Yemen on Wednesday. This is the third time for
the Ethiopian foreign minister to visit the two countries since
the conflict broke out between them in mid-December last year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Syria-Israeli Negotiations Embark on New Phase (Part 2) (by Wang Genbao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the light of the new situation, U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher launched another Middle East shuttle diplomacy
in mid-December. At the end of the tour he announced the success
of his mission by obtaining commitments of Israel and Syria to
resume their deadlocked negotiations on December 27 in Maryland,
near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Following the second round of the Syrian-israeli talks in the
U.S., Christopher is to start his 15th Middle East trip on January
10 for an evaluation of the outcome of the Syrian-Israeli
negotiations and for talks with Syrian President al-Assad and
Israeli Prime Minister Peres on the subsequent steps for reaching
agreement on a formula to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that the current phase of Syrian-Israeli
negotiations differs from the previous ones. This time, there are
no pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
Everything is for discussion at the negotiation table. The
objective is to reach an integrated agreement incorporating the
four pillars of a Syrian-Israeli settlement, namely, withdrawal,
normalization of relations, security arrangements and a timetable
for implementation.
</P>
<P>
Political observers of Middle East affairs believe that despite
the prevailing atmosphere of cautioned optimism regarding the
prospects of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations, there still remain
certain essential differences between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding issues to be settled include the future of the
Golan Heights, the prospect of peace between the two countries
after three bloody wars and ways to make the border secure.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the two sides primarily differ on the size
of Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Syria demands a withdrawal to the lines before
June 4, 1967 war as a condition for the establishment of
comprehensive peace and normalization of bilateral relations,
adamantly rejecting any territorial compromise.
</P>
<P>
While Israel, on the other hand, upholds that the extent of
withdrawal is commensurate with the extent of peace.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns Wednesday said
"we expect many, many, many difficult discussions before an
agreement is reached, if an agreement is going to be reached."
</P>
<P>
He added that one of the tasks for the ongoing second round of
talks is to agree upon a procedural way to move those discussion
forward.
</P>
<P>
Political observers are of the view that the resumption of
negotiations represents a favorable beginning which augurs a
bright future, though there are strong indications that a
breakthrough is not imminent.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that what is important is the need to
translate the positive and encouraging signals into an agreement
on a just and comprehensive regional peace, in return for a
commitment to U.N. resolutions concerned and the land-for-peace
formula.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-israeli negotiations are actually undergoing a
decisive and important stage, observers here said. The positive
sign of the current Syrian-Israeli Washington talks meant an
opening of the door to the prospective establishment of a just
and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official daily Tishrin expressed hope Wednesday that
 1996 should be the year of peace on the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks though reiterating Syria's demand that Israel commit itself
to a complete and early withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department spokesman also said the ultimate goal
of the U.S. in 1996 is to try to help Syria and Israel reach a
comprehensive agreement between them that will resolve the
problems that have separated them since 1948.

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Israeli Peace Talks End With Productive  Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Syrian and Israeli
negotiators today concluded the second round of peace talks at the
Wye Conference Center on Maryland's Eastern Shore, and said their
discussions were productive.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Israeli, Syrian and American delegations, U.S.
special Middle East envoy Dennis Ross issued a statement, saying
"all three delegations believe that the discussions were fruitful,
constructive and practical."
</P>
<P>
"The discussions were conducted in a positive and open
atmosphere," the statement said, "a good start was made in
developing a general basis for progress on substance and on the
procedures for dealing with the main issues to be overcome."
</P>
<P>
However, the statement acknowledged that there is still a big
gap between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "while there is still a great deal of
work to be done and gaps to be bridged, these initial talks at the
Wye Conference Centers have been productive."
</P>
<P>
Syrian and Israeli negotiators hold the first round of the
three-day talks in six months last week in Maryland with American
mediators.
</P>
<P>
Last night U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher joined
the second round, which restarted on Wednesday, and had a meeting
with the Syrian and Israeli negotiating teams together.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at today's news
briefing that he thought Christopher last night "was struck by the
very positive tone and atmosphere of these negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The secretary will begin a tour of the Middle East on January
10 and report the results of the two rounds talks to Syrian
President Hafez Assad and Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Burns said, "We are very pleased by these six days of talks. We
are encouraged by these talks."
</P>
<P>
"Both on procedure and substance we feel that these talks
served their purpose," the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Natives of Disputed Islands to "Be alert against Aggression" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Iran has urged natives of the
disputed island of Abu Musa to "be alert against any aggression"
and "defend every inch of our territory."
</P>
<P>
The strongly-worded statement was made by Iranian First Vice-
President Hassan Habibi today in the disputed island of Abu Musa,
the highest ranking Iranian official ever set his foot on this
island, the most controversial dispute between Iran and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Addressing natives of the island, he said, "You, the people of
Abus Musa, are the representatives of 60 million Iranians. You are
the border guards of the Islamic Republic."
</P>
<P>
"We all have the duty to defend every inch of our country," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president warned the natives of Abu Musa of potential
foreign aggression against the island, saying that the United
States would not spare every effort to hatch plots against Iran.
</P>
<P>
During his tour to the island for development project, Habibi
also promised the local people more development projects on the
island.
</P>
<P>
According to Iranian television, Habibi, who is accompanied by
several officials including Minister of Roads and Transport Akbar
Torkan, is scheduled to travel to Bandar Abbas, Qeshm and Kish to
inaugurate several development projects.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Iran claimed that it has completed the defensive
projects on "all its strategically important islands in the
Persian Gulf."
</P>
<P>
Iran is to inaugurate an airport by February 10 on Abu Musa
island, the Persian language daily Salam reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The three islands of Abu Musa, Lesser and Greater Tonbs, which
are claimed by both Iran and the UAE and are now held by Iran, are
strategically located at the mouth of the Strait of Hormuz in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran took control of half of the Abu Musa island in 1971, when
it reached an agreement with the UAE on joint administration.
</P>
<P>
In september 1992, Iran declared it was the sole owner of the
island.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has said that it will take their dispute with Iran
before the International Court of Justice in the Hague. However,
Iran has rejected the demand.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Maintains Iraqi Sanctions at Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council, in its regular 60-day review of sanctions against Iraq,
on Friday decided to maintain the economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
Council President John Weston of Britain, told reporters
after a morning closed-door meeting that no agreement
was reached on lifting sanctions against Iraq, so the sanctions
would remain.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed against Iraq shortly after its
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Exports such as oil require
compliance with weapon provisions of the U.N. resolution ending
the Gulf War, in another word it has to get rid of its weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Since last August new revelations of past and perhaps present
arms programs previously concealed from the U.N. have come to
light.
</P>
<P>
Under this situation, the Council was reluctant to seriously
lifting or easing sanctions until the weapons demands are
fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
But at the meeting, France's Ambassador Alain Dejammet
suggested that U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
provide a new report on the humanitarian situation in Iraq, so
that the Council can have a clear picture of the situation over
there.
</P>
<P>
It has been reported malnutrition among children and other
health hazards because of the embargoes.
</P>
<P>
Council members want Iraq to accept a limited oil sales deal
under U.N. monitoring that would help alleviate the humanitarian
suffering. But so far Iraq has rejected it, saying that it
violates its sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Party Leader Assures West of Powerful Ally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Pro-Islamist Welfare
Party (RP) leader Necmettin Erbakan said today that the West has
nothing to fear from his party's coming to power because then
Turkey will be a powerful ally of the West.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said at a press conference that Turkey would "build
closer ties with the West," while denying reports that the RP is
an enemy of the West.
</P>
<P>
The RP leader explained that they will choose the most
discerning party as a coalition partner after negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he will insist on being the prime minister in a
possible coalition government, Erbakan said the people had already
chosen the prime minister when they elected the RP as the first
party.
</P>
<P>
The other four parties which entered the parliament by passing
the 10-percent national threshold said that they would not make
coalition with the RP as it is against the securism which Turkey
has been implementing since the country was founded as a republic
in 1923.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said the RP would not sacrifice Turkey's independence,
human rights or freedom of belief, while taking part in a
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He said that Turkey's foreign policy would be based on peace,
friendship and justice and that Turkey had been treated as an
enslaved country. Now the RP will be a respected and trusted
partner for the West and will recognize the ties between the RP
and the West based on mutual concern, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Turkey's recent customs union with the European Union (EU),
Erbakan said, "There are some particular articles in the customs
union treaty that are unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
The main aim of the customs union is liberalizing the economy
and removing tariffs, he said. "That is O.K.. But Turkey is not
taking part in the decision-making process, despite the fact that
it has to approve all European Union regulations. that is called
colonialism," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Besides, it restricts Turkey's trade with other countries,
including the 'Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,' Erbakan said,
adding, "I am deeply surprised how they could suggest such an
agreement."
</P>
<P>
The RP regards the customs union between Turkey and the EU as a
part of a Western plot to hold the Moslem world under its
economic domination.

<HEADLINE> US House Passes Bill to Recall Furloughed Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. House of
representatives Friday passed a bill by a 401-17 vote that would
temporarily return some 280,000 furloughed federal employees to
work but leave many government functions without pay.
</P>
<P>
A second part of the Republican plan would reopen the entire
government through January 26, but only if President Bill Clinton
proposed a balanced budget with estimates certified by the
Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole said he is hopeful his chamber
would pass the proposal today.
</P>
<P>
House Democrats had preferred an emergency spending bill to
reopen the entire government without preconditions. They said the
Republican plan would solve federal workers' financial problems,
but leave a crazy quilt of government openings and closures.
</P>
<P>
The White House said President Clinton would sign the
legislation. But Clinton called the plan ending the furloughs
"cruel and unusual punishment" because it would not restore all
services.
</P>
<P>
The republican plan would send 280,000 furloughed U.S.
employees back to work with pay through January 26 and reopen some
government facilities and programs immediately. About 480,000
other workers in unfunded agencies -- on the job but unpaid since
the partial closure began December 16 -- would also receive their
full salaries through January 26.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called the Republican proposal a "good first step," but
said, "we ought to go all the way" and reopen the government
completely.

<HEADLINE> Russian Presidential Spokesman Says FM's Removal  Does Not Mean Foreign Policy Changes  (By Zhang Tiegang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Andrei
Kozrev's resignation does not mean any radical changes in the
Kremlin's foreign policy, presidential spokesman Sergei Medvedev
said today.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on relieving
Kozyrev from the post of Foreign Minister after a telephone talk
between them earlier today.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the president's decision, Medvedev said, "The
president's actions were logical: Boris Yeltsin repeatedly and
sharply criticized the Foreign Ministry and its leader for
miscalculations and drawbacks connected with the conduct of
Russia's foreign policy and coordination of activities o various
ministries and departments operating abroad."
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman pointed out, "Russian and foreign
observers, politicians and journalists should not regard today's
decision by Boris Yeltsin as a threatening gesture aimed at a
radical change in the policy, above all with regard to the West."
</P>
<P>
Medvedev stressed that Russia will strengthen, in future too,
cooperation with foreign countries, based on mutual understanding
as well as on political and economic mutual advantage. The
president himself will be a guarantor of inviolability of the
pursued course, Medvedev added.
</P>
<P>
He cited Yeltsin as saying that foreign policy priorities are
the building up of Russia's ties with CIS (Commonwealth of
Independent States) members, of its partnership with Western
nations, China, Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
He also cited Yeltsin's focus on ensuring Russia's interests in
a comprehensive European security system which would preclude new
partition lines and give Russia an appropriate say in European
affairs.
</P>
<P>
In his words, Yeltsin now conducts consultations on a successor
of Kozyrev, since the Russian leader understands that the post of
Foreign Minister is one of the most important in the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Lukin, Chairman of the State Duma (the lower house of
the Russian Parliament) Committee for International Affairs and
one of the leaders of the Yabloko bloc, welcomed the resignation
of Kozyrev, who was elected to the new Duma last month and
declared his intention to concentrate on parliamentary activity.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Lukin said the president's decision accepting
Kozyrev's resignation was too late and "could have a negative
impact on the country's foreign policy, because too much will have
to be corrected".
</P>
<P>
"Many people, including myself, stressed as early as in 1992
that public opinion did not accept Kozyrev as the Foreign Minister
because of his Foreign Ministry's performance," Lukin said.
</P>
<P>
Kozyrev, 45, has headed the Foreign Ministry since October 11,
1990.
</P>
<P>
In the legislative elections held on December 17, 1995, Kozyrev
won a Duma seat in the Murmansk one-mandate constituency. The
operating legislation forbids to combine the Duma deputy's duties
with work at bodies of executive power.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the president's decision dismissing Kozyrev,
Medvedev noted that the time set by the Central Electoral
Commission for civil servants elected to the Duma expired today:
they had to decide whether to preserve their former posts or to
become legislators, since it is impossible to combine the two
duties.
</P>
<P>
Kozyrev was the second cabinet member relieved of his duties by
a presidential decree today. The first was Deputy Prime Minister
Sergei Shakhrai, who was elected to the new Duma, too, and offered
his resignation from the cabinet some ten days ago.
</P>
<P>
The presidential decree on releasing Shakhrai from his job
contains the wording "at his request," but the decree on Kozyrev
lacks it. This warrants a supposition that either the minister did
not tender a written request to the president about his
resignation or he worded it orally during today's telephone
conversation with Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The announcement on Kozyrev's dismissal from his post was
issued only one hour before the expiration of the deadline set by
the Central Election Commission for newly-elected deputies, who
were in civil service before their election to the lower Chamber.
</P>
<P>
Kozyrev was not at his office today, since he has been on his
annual leave at a health-building center in the Moscow region
already for several days. His first deputy Igor Ivanov is also on
leave. Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Krylov runs the ministry's
affairs during their absence.

<HEADLINE> Prison Riot in Istanbul Spreads across Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Calm returned today to the Uskudar
prison in Umraniye District of Istanbul after the bloody riots
left three prisoners dead on Thursday, but the unrest spread to
other prisons across the country.
</P>
<P>
In Uskudar prison, besides the three dead, 28 other inmates and
seven prison guards were wounded in the fighting on January 4
between the security forces and the political prisoners who
barricaded themselves up in a cell block.
</P>
<P>
Inmates in other prisons staged protest actions against the
heavy-handed suppression of the prison uprising.
</P>
<P>
In the Bayrampasa jail, the inmates held hostage the prison
director and 11 wardens.
</P>
<P>
In Buca prison near Izmir along the Aegean coast, the inmates
are reportedly holding 15 guards and three prison wardens as
hostages, and warning the authorities that no Uskudar-style
crackdown should take place at this prison.
</P>
<P>
The inmates in the Ankara prison, also housing former
parliamentians of the outlawed pro-Kurdish Democracy Party,
demonstrated in support of the Uskudar uprising, kept 10 guards
as hostage, but later released them.
</P>
<P>
In Yozgat prison housing primarily political prisoners, the
inmates demonstrated in solidarity with the Uskudar prison,
barricading the cell blocks and shouting slogans.
</P>
<P>
The unrest in the Uskudar prison started when lawyers from the
Human Rights Association demanded to speak with some of the
political prisoners Thursday morning, and contacted Director of
Prisons Administration Zeki Gungor but they were refused by prison
officials.
</P>
<P>
Gungor told the lawyers about a security operation being
carried out by gendarmerie and special police teams on orders
from the Ministry of Justice.
</P>
<P>
In Istanbul, families of prisoners held demonstrations in
Sultanahmet square and in the vicinity of the prison accusing
police and gendarmerie of trying to kill some inmates.

JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Central

declared that there are 676 candidates running for membership of

</P>

At a press conference in the West Bank town of Ramallah, Abbas

have registered for the PC elections due to take place on January
20. The voters registration process is still in progress.
</P>
<P>
Abbas added that the commission is facing several unsolved
problems, including how the Palestinian police and security
personnel will vote.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the individuals have to vote in the location
they registered in, but the police and security personnel are
deployed in various places. "So will the police and security
personnel elect persons that they do not know or will polling
boxes be transported to their bases?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Abbas also said that the Palestinian TV will give each PC
candidate one to two minutes with a certain price for their
election campaign, while the Voice of Palestine radio will give
the candidate two to three minutes free of charge.
</P>
<P>
The balloting itself will take place in 1,696 voting stations
throughout the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Syrian-Israeli Negotiations Embark on New Phase (Part 2) (by Wang Genbao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the light of the new situation, U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher launched another Middle East shuttle diplomacy
in mid-December. At the end of the tour he announced the success
of his mission by obtaining commitments of Israel and Syria to
resume their deadlocked negotiations on December 27 in Maryland,
near Washington.
</P>
<P>
Following the second round of the Syrian-israeli talks in the
U.S., Christopher is to start his 15th Middle East trip on January
10 for an evaluation of the outcome of the Syrian-Israeli
negotiations and for talks with Syrian President al-Assad and
Israeli Prime Minister Peres on the subsequent steps for reaching
agreement on a formula to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that the current phase of Syrian-Israeli
negotiations differs from the previous ones. This time, there are
no pre-conditions.
</P>
<P>
Everything is for discussion at the negotiation table. The
objective is to reach an integrated agreement incorporating the
four pillars of a Syrian-Israeli settlement, namely, withdrawal,
normalization of relations, security arrangements and a timetable
for implementation.
</P>
<P>
Political observers of Middle East affairs believe that despite
the prevailing atmosphere of cautioned optimism regarding the
prospects of the Syrian-Israeli negotiations, there still remain
certain essential differences between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding issues to be settled include the future of the
Golan Heights, the prospect of peace between the two countries
after three bloody wars and ways to make the border secure.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said the two sides primarily differ on the size
of Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, Syria demands a withdrawal to the lines before
June 4, 1967 war as a condition for the establishment of
comprehensive peace and normalization of bilateral relations,
adamantly rejecting any territorial compromise.
</P>
<P>
While Israel, on the other hand, upholds that the extent of
withdrawal is commensurate with the extent of peace.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns Wednesday said
"we expect many, many, many difficult discussions before an
agreement is reached, if an agreement is going to be reached."
</P>
<P>
He added that one of the tasks for the ongoing second round of
talks is to agree upon a procedural way to move those discussion
forward.
</P>
<P>
Political observers are of the view that the resumption of
negotiations represents a favorable beginning which augurs a
bright future, though there are strong indications that a
breakthrough is not imminent.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that what is important is the need to
translate the positive and encouraging signals into an agreement
on a just and comprehensive regional peace, in return for a
commitment to U.N. resolutions concerned and the land-for-peace
formula.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-israeli negotiations are actually undergoing a
decisive and important stage, observers here said. The positive
sign of the current Syrian-Israeli Washington talks meant an
opening of the door to the prospective establishment of a just
and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official daily Tishrin expressed hope Wednesday that
 1996 should be the year of peace on the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks though reiterating Syria's demand that Israel commit itself
to a complete and early withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department spokesman also said the ultimate goal
of the U.S. in 1996 is to try to help Syria and Israel reach a
comprehensive agreement between them that will resolve the
problems that have separated them since 1948.

Minister Tomiichi Murayama, the White House said here today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton looks forward to meeting with the
new japanese leader during a visit to Japan in April, the White
House said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Murayama announced his resignation today, but his resignation
does not take effect until the Diet convenes to elect a new prime

Murayama's contributions and cooperation in developing relations
between the two countries, including in the area of security
cooperation, the statement noted.

type of cooperation as the Japanese form a new government," White
House spokesman Mike McCurry said at a news briefing.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Denounces Killings in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein, political wing of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA), denounced today the series of
killings in Northern Ireland during the past month, saying that it
did not want to see anyone killed again, according to reports from
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
A group in Northern Ireland calling itself Direct Action
Against Drugs have claimed five murders since last December, and
police in the province believed this is the cover name used by the
IRA to have carried out these killings.
</P>
<P>
In the past few days, some Tory parliament members and Ulster
Unionist Party challenged Sinn Fein to condemn the murders.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the British government to suspend contact with
Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Irish officials in the capital of the
Irish Republic today, Sinn Fein's vice-president Pat Doherty
indicated that his party would try to work with various groups in
the Catholic community to ease the situation.
</P>
<P>
Doherty also said that his party hoped to talk to British and
Irish governments in the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British government indicated that it would
continue talks with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
UUP leader David Trimble said he could understand the British
government's reluctance to do what some would see as terminating
the peace process by ceasing contact with Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
But the government's policy on its relations with Sinn Fein
would become untenable if the current spate of murders in Ulster
continued, he added.
</P>
<P>
The series of killings also irritated the Irish government and
other parties in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring said the murders in Northern
Ireland could not be justified by anybody from whatever quarters.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the situation in Ulster was "worrying" and that
the opportunity for peace must not be "frittered away".
</P>
<P>
The Social Democratic and Labor Party, the largest Catholic
party in Ulster, and the Alliance Party, which keeps a neutral
position in the conflict, also condemned the killings, but they
maintained that dialogue with Sinn Fein must continue.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Condemns Violence in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Nations, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security council
on Friday strongly condemned recent violence in Burundi and
encouraged all states to prevent those persons responsible for the
violence from traveling abroad and receiving any kind of support.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official response of the council to a late
December letter by Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who
said there was a "real danger of the situation in Burundi
degenerating to the point where it might explode into ethnic
violence on a massive scale."
</P>
<P>
"The council shares the secretary-general's deep concern at the
situation in Burundi, which has been characterized by daily
killings, massacres, torture and arbitrary detention," said a
presidential statement of the council.
</P>
<P>
The council called upon all concerned in Burundi to exercise
maximum restraint and to refrain from all acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated that all those who commit or authorize the
commission of serious violations of international humanitarian law
are individually responsible for such violations and should be
held accountable.
</P>
<P>
The council also expressed grave concern at recent attacks on
personnel of international humanitarian organizations, which had
led to the suspension of essential assistance to refugees and
displaced persons and to the temporary withdrawal of international
personnel.
</P>
<P>
It underlined that the authorities in Burundi are responsible
for the security of personnel of international humanitarian
organizations and of the refugees and displaced persons there and
called upon the government of Burundi to provide adequate security
to food convoys and humanitarian personnel.
</P>
<P>
According to the letter of the secretary-general, the
deteriorating situation is underscored by recent decisions of the
international organizations including the International Committee
of the Red Cross, the World Food Programme and most
non-governmental organizations to curtail or suspend their
activities in Burundi following a spate of violent attacks against
their personnel and assets.

<HEADLINE> Christopher, Holbrooke to Visit Balkans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) - U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher plans to visit three Balkan capitals in February to
promote the fragile peace process in the region, the State
Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary is planning his own diplomatic mission to the
Balkans in early February where he'll be visiting Belgrade,
Zagreb, Sarajevo and possibly other capitals in the region to
assess the degree of compliance with the Dayton Accords and to
advance implementation of those accords," spokesman Nicholas Burns
told reporters at a regular press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came only one day after the White House said
that U.S. President Bill Clinton plans to visit Bosnia "in a
matter of days."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry toured Bosnia on Wednesday
to see the progress of the deployment of the U.S. peace
implementation force in the former Yugoslav republic. The 20,000
American ground troops are part of the planned 60,000-strong
NATO-led multinational force to enforce the U.S.-brokered Bosnian
peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Burns said that Christopher had also asked U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke to go to Belgrade, Zagreb and
Sarajevo early next week in advance of President Bill Clinton's
trip to that region.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke was widely believed to be the chief architect of the
Bosnian peace treaty as he carried out shuttle diplomacy for the
peaceful settlement of the Balkan war and chaired peace talks
among the leaders of the former three warring Balkan nations in
the past few months.

<HEADLINE> First US Troops Withdraw From Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A contingent of the U.S.
peacekeeping troops left Haiti today, becoming the first American
military group withdrawing from the island as the U.N.
peacekeeping mission winds down by the end of February, according
to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The 66 members of the U.S. Army's Fifth Special Forces group
boarded a chartered plane, carrying rifles, backpacks and Haitian
sculptures as souvenirs, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At its peak, the U.N. force which helped the island restore
democracy in 1994 numbered nearly 6,000 troops, of which 2,400
were American. The U.N. troops began to leave Haiti last November
and their number had reduced to about 5,700 by December.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. troops landed in Haiti in September to help restore
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power. In the following month,
the United Nations began its peacekeeping mission on the island.
</P>
<P>
Aristide, was toppled in a military coup in 1991 shortly after
his landslide victory in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. mission will help provide security for the
inauguration of Haiti's newly-elected President Rene Preval in
early February, but all the U.N. troops are planned to leave there
by the end of February.

<P>
MOSCOW, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister
Sergei Krylov will temporarily be the acting Foreign Minister,
Foreign Ministry spokesman Grigoy Karasin said today.
</P>
<P>
Such a decision was made before President Boris Yeltsin issued
a decree today relieving Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev of his
duties, the spokesman emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Kozyrev's First Deputy Igor Ivanov is on brief holidays and
will return from vacation early next week, Karasin said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it shoud become clear in the near future who
will be the acting Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that, as far as he knew, the president's
apparatus was currently considering possible candidates for the
new head of the Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin issued his decree dismissing Kozyrev soon after his
telephone conversation with the top Russian diplomat. Kozyrev was
elected to the State Duma, the lower house of the Russian
Parliament, in December. Operating legislation forbids to combine
the Duma deputy's duties with work at bodies of executive power.

<HEADLINE> West Accused Of Preventing Entry Of Malaysian Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said here today that some developed countries
were trying to prevent the entry of Malaysian goods into their
markets by accusing the country of dumping its products.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said his country cannot be regarded as dumping its
goods in other countries because of the low prices of its
products.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after opening an orphanage complex here, Mahathir
said: "It is normal for the same goods to be sold in the country
at a higher price as we impose tax and when they are exported no
tax is levied. This is normal practice."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a recent report which quoted European Community
(EC) countries as claiming that many countries including Malaysia
dumped their goods in EC countries, he said: "It is a matter of
interpretation whether to call it dumping or not. Sometimes they
want to prevent entry of our goods, they charge that we are
dumping.
</P>
<P>
"Before they impose any countervailing duty they must first
determine whether it is correct or not," Mahathir said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Offers Measure on Illegal Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai employers will be able to
legally hire illegal immigrants, if they register with the
Employment Department and put up a 5,000-baht (200 US dollars) for
each one.
</P>
<P>
Thai employers failing to abide by this would face up to three
years in jail or a fine up to 60,000 baht (2,400 dollars), Prasit
Chaithongphan, chief of the Employment Department, was quoted as
saying by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
The measure reportedly was targeted at improving the
government's control over the growing illegal immigrant population
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, some 500,000 illegal immigrants from
neighboring countries have penetrated into Thailand to make
fortunes as the country faces a labor shortage due to fast
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The authorities, which are concerned that the illegal
immigrants may pose a threat to national security and local
communities, previously tackled the issue by arrest, fine or
deportation. Yet these measures seemed less effective.

<HEADLINE> "China Threat Theory" Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A signed article in today's
issue of "China National Defense News" refutes the theory of
"China Threat".
</P>
<P>
The history of the development of the Chinese nation shows that
China has never waged any war against other nations or countries
as long as there was no large-scale outside invasion which would
threaten national existence and the country's security and unity,
the article says, adding that, on the contrary, China has been
subjected to the invasion and oppression of outside forces over
the past century or so.
</P>
<P>
"To struggle for and safeguard world peace and seek national
development and social progress are in the fundamental interests
of the Chinese people, who used to be plagued by imperialism,
colonialism and poverty," it says, explaining that the economic
development level of China is still very low in terms of both per
capita income and consumption level, and its economic structure is
also rather irrational.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, it notes, China will have to make
great efforts to increase the per capita national gross product
and it will take the relentless efforts of several generations of
Chinese to catch up with the economic level of moderately
developed countries, not to say that of the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The development of China requires a peaceful international
environment, and a prosperous and stable China will be more
conducive to world peace instead of posing any threat to any other
nation, the article points out.
</P>
<P>
"Essentially, the spread of the 'China Threat Theory' is aimed
at curbing China's growth," it says.
</P>
<P>
After the Cold War ended, the article says, the two-pole
framework disintegrated and the world is developing in the
direction of multi-polarity. But the Western forces represented by
the United States have not stopped their hegemonist behavior but

<HEADLINE> French Parliament Speaker Ends Visit to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 6 (Xinhua) -- President of the French National
Assembly Philippe Seguin left here this evening for Amman, winding
up a 24-hour visit in Lebanon during which he held talks with
Lebanese leaders.
</P>
<P>
At the Beirut International Airport, Seguin expressed his
belief that Lebanon will face "with all confidence" a crucial
future stage, when a just and comprehensive peace will spread
soon all over the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that his country is determined to make the maximum
efforts to help Lebanon reach its two main goals -- sovereignty
and independence.
</P>
<P>
He ruled out a French interference with the approaching
parliamentary elections in Lebanon, saying that a "renewal"
of the Lebanese Council of Deputies is an internal affair of
this country.
</P>
<P>
Seguin, who arrived here Friday night on the first leg of his
tour of the region, started his official activities this morning
by meeting with Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Hariri, he also met with Lebanese
parliament speaker Nabih Berri and President Elias hrawi.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Hariri, Seguin told reporters that
he discussed with the prime minister on bilateral relations and
the situation in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Seguin said that a Lebanese turn will come soon and it will be
"directly" invited to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the problems which the resolution 425 talks
about will be in the essence of the negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Seguin said that France will not only upholds its position
supporting Lebanon's sovereignty, but also make efforts to
contribute to an establishment of peace in Lebanon and in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said that France is "conscious and firm" in its foreign
policies, especially in respecting Lebanon's sovereignty and
independence.
</P>
<P>
Beirut is the first leg of Seguin's tour in the region,
which will also take him to Israel, the Palestinian self-rule
area, Egypt, Syria and Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Beilin Hopes Christopher Shuttle Can Bring Breakthrough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Minister Yossi Beilin
said today that he hopes next week's shuttle diplomacy between
Israel and Syria by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
can lead to a breakthrough in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted him as saying that the current talks
between Israel and Syria in Maryland have not led to a
substantive breakthrough, but the talks themselves have been very
important.
</P>
<P>
Beilin, Minister in the Prime Minister's Office, also
explained that the current discussions between the two sides have
helped both sides a lot to really talk for the first time.
</P>
<P>
He added that such openness could lead to peace between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The negotiators are to wrap up the current three-day talks
today. They held the first round of talks from December 27 to
December 29 at the same site.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Christopher joined the negotiators last night, and
was told by them that they have made progress in the
discussions. However, reports from the meeting indicated that
Syria has only given a partial answer to the Israeli question
about the nature of peace.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. administration official said Thursday that
Christopher's trip to the region starting on January 10 will
likely lead to further Israeli-Syrian negotiations at the end of
this month.
</P>
<P>
"I'm fairly confident Christopher will announce the resumption
of talks here, probably at the end of January," the official, who
remained anonymous, said.
</P>
<P>
Whether the talks will return to the Wye River site in eastern
Maryland will be determined during the trip, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. will issue a brief statement today on behalf of
Israel and Syria that will be "short on detail," but will note
the positive atmosphere during the six days of talks, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
During his shuttle, Christopher will also seek to nail down a
timetable for future negotiations, and will discuss whether and
when to move from the current core group of negotiators to
working groups involving experts on water, security and economic
issues, according to the official.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Two Muslim policemen were
seriously wounded Thursday night in the Bosnian city of Mostar
apparently by Croat gunfires as the latest sign of tension rising
between the two former foes.
</P>
<P>
The policemen were driving on the downtown Bulevar Street when
their car was hit by more than 10 rounds of small-arm firing from
the Croat side, local reports quoted Hans Koschnick, the EU
administrator of the city as saying.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred on the very separation line formed during
fierce fightings between Croats and Muslims in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The incident followed the New Year day killing of a Muslim
youth, shot by Bosnian Croat police when he failed to stop at a
checkpoint and stoning of Croatian-registered cars by Muslims
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
"Such incidents make the life difficult here and put the Dayton
accord stipulations at stake," Koschnick said, adding that "There
were people on both sides eager to destroy any signs of a healthy
atmosphere."

<HEADLINE> UK Universities Threaten to Cut Student Intake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's universities are
threatening to admit more foreign students and turn away British
undergraduates this year in protest against the government which
would squeeze higher education funding, reported the Times
newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
A growing number of vice-chancellors are rallying behind the
notion that would lead them to clash with the government and end
an era of higher education growth, in which university places have
increased by 50 percent since 1989.
</P>
<P>
Some vice-chancellors favor the more radical alternative of
charging all students direct "top-up" fees, depending on the cost
of their course.
</P>
<P>
The budget announced by the government last November imposed a
cut in higher education funding of seven percent in real terms in
the next academic year, after 25 percent reduction over the past
five years.
</P>
<P>
And capital funding was cut by 31 percent because the
government had to get extra money for primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
Universities are free to charge a market rate for non-European
Union students, who pay for themselves or are funded by their
governments.
</P>
<P>
Annual fees for British students are fixed by the government at
750 pounds (1,125 US dollars) for classroom-based subjects, 1,600
pounds (2,400 dollars) for laboratory or workshop-based courses.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Vice-Chancellors and Principals estimates that
the true cost of these courses as 6,000 (9,000 dollars), 8,000
(12,000 dollars) and 14,500 pounds (23,200 dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Times said the two notions put forth by vice-chancellors
will be debated at an emergency meeting on February 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) Board today approved the 10 billion dollars marriage of
Chemical Banking Corp. and Chase Manhattan Corp., the largest
banking merger in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
The Fed approval came after a closed meeting, a board
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
But it was just one of several steps before the two prominent
banks can combine. The deal needs approval from state banking
regulators in Delaware and New York, and the banks themselves say
they're not ready to combine until March 31.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the Justice Department cleared the merger without
conditions, saying it found no antitrust issues in the
combination, Chemical spokesman Ken Herz said.
</P>
<P>
The merger of Chemical and Chase will create an enormous bank
with 297 billion dollars in assets, and a leading position in
consumer banking, mortgages, credit cards, corporate lending and
other global services.
</P>
<P>
The combination also is expected to result in the elimination
of 12,000 jobs and 100 branch closings.

SANAA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh met here today with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa on bilateral ties and means of settling a dispute between
Yemen and Eritrea over three Red Sea islands.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, who arrived here earlier today for a brief visit to
Yemen, conveyed a message from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
Saleh for a peaceful solution to settling the Yemen-Eritrean
dispute.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Saleh said that his country would do its

with mediation efforts being made by Egypt and other friendly Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said his mission was aimed at halting the escalation of
the Yemeni-Eritrean dispute over the islands. The Greater Hanish
island is the largest of the three located in the southern part of
the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has sent envoys to the two countries in a bid to prevent
the tension from growing. After his visit to Yemen, Moussa will
fly to Eritrea in further efforts to facilitate dialogue between
the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Greek Orthodox to Bestow Peace Medal on Arafat. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Diodoros I, the Greek
Orthodox patriarch of Jerusalem, this evening will present PLO
Chairman Yasser Arafat with a golden peace medal in recognition of
his efforts for peace in the Middle East, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony will take place in Bethlehem this evening when
Arafat is scheduled to attend the Greek Orthodox midnight
Christmas service, which is due to be held at the Church of the
Nativity in this West Bank town.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, Diodoros I bestowed similar medals on
Jordan's King Hussein and Crown Prince Hassan, and on the late
Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and then Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
The Greek Orthodox Christmas, observed according to the Julian
calendar and marked tonight, is the second of three Christmas
celebrations observed in the Christian community here.
</P>
<P>
The traditional procession of the Greek Orthodox Patriarch set
out from east Jerusalem this afternoon and was greeted by the mass
of celebrants at the entrance of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
On December 25, Arafat, accompanied by his wife Suha, attended
the first Christmas midnight mass for the Roman Catholics in
Bethlehem, which was the city's first Christmas under Palestinian
rule after the Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The third Christmas, the Armenian, is marked on the night of
January 18, and Archbishop David Sahagian of the Armenian
Patriarchate said that he did not yet know if Arafat planned to
come to the Armenian celebration as well.
</P>
<P>
After 28 years of occupation, the Israeli army pulled out of
Bethlehem, where Jesus was born according to Christian tradition,
on December 21, in accordance with the Oslo 2 accord between
Israel and the Palestinians to expand the Palestinian autonomy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the Israeli army had concluded its
redeployments from the West Bank towns of Jenin, Tulkarm,
Karkilya, Nablus and Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Israel will also hand over Hebron, another West Bank town, to
the Palestinian National Authority in March this year.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian PM: Government Seeks to Double Economic Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Egyptian government will make
efforts to double the current economic growth rate so that it can
exceed that of the population growth, Prime Minister Kamal
el-Ganzouri said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, who was named as new prime minister immediately after
his predecessor Atef Sedki's cabinet resigned Tuesday, said
following the first cabinet meeting he presided over that
increasing the economic growth rate is one of the biggest
challenges the new government is facing.
</P>
<P>
Mohi Eddin El-Gharib, Minister of Finance in the new cabinet,
said Thursday that the new cabinet will work toward the goal of
increasing the annual economic growth rate from 3.5 percent to 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, however, the Central Bank of Egypt said the country's
economy grew 4.7 percent in the 1994-95 fiscal year, which ended
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri also said that the government will work to create job
opportunities for 500,000 people per year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has been one of the major social problems of Egypt
mainly because of the slow economic growth and overpopulation.
According to Egypt's latest official statistics, the unemployment
rate is 7 percent. But Western economists put it at 17-20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister added that the government will also try
to increase exports, which were worth 4 billion Egyptian pounds
(about 1.18 billion U.S. dollars) in 1995 according to figures
provided by the Egyptian Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri, a 63-year-old economist, stressed the importance of
the role of the private sector in speeding up the economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"The government encourages the Egyptian, Arab and international
private sectors to invest in Egypt," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, who also serves as planning minister, said
that the cabinet will meet in 10 days to discuss removing
obstacles hindering investment in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Bureaucracy and red-tape have been believed to be among the
main elements that discourage foreign investment in the country,
which boasts a population of nearly 60 million.
</P>
<P>
Ganzouri's cabinet, which includes seven new faces, is expected
to quicken the pace of the economic reform program which began in
1991 in a bid to push forward the economic development.
</P>
<P>
The three economic portfolios -- economy, finance and industry
-- changed hands, further indicating that the cabinet reshuffle is
aimed at achieving a more rapid economic development.
</P>
<P>
Economy Minister Nawal el-Tatawi has promised to press on with
privatization through new share issues on the stock exchange.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Gazans Attend Ayyash Funeral Procession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 100,000
Palestinians today participated in a mass procession in Gaza City
before the funeral of Hamas activist Yehia Ayyash, who was killed
Friday in an explosion in the Gaza strip, took place.
</P>
<P>
The coffin of Ayyash, known as "the Engineer," was damaged at
the start of the procession when many Hamas supporters tried to
carry the coffin. They chanted slogans, burned Israeli flags and
called for revenge on Israel. A gun salute accidentally wounded
two mourners.
</P>
<P>
Hamas leaders led the procession under Palestinian police
escort. Riot police were deployed in Gaza's main streets to
prevent possible disturbances.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the funeral were Palestinian Authority
officials and Ayyash's family members from the West Bank who have
 received permission to attend.
</P>
<P>
PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who paid condolences to Hamas
leader Mahamud Al-Zahhar Friday night, did not attend the funeral.
</P>
<P>
Parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip were paralyzed
today as a general strike was observed in mourning of Ayyash, who
Israel believes was the mastermind behind a series of suicide
bombing attacks which claimed lives of some 70 Israelis and
wounded some 300 others.
</P>
<P>
In Nablus, Hamas supporters held a mock funeral, carrying a
Palestinian flag-draped coffin. In Jericho, demonstrators burned
Israeli flags, while in Ramallah and Jenin, thousands took to the
street calling for revenge attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police have confirmed that Ayyash was killed
by a booby-trap mobile phone handed to him by a man on the
outskirts of the Jabalya refugee camp north of Gaza city.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has blamed the Israeli General Security Services (GSS)
for the "murder" and has threatened revenge attacks, but Israel
so far has declined to acknowledge any responsibility for the
incident.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Israeli security forces have been put on
high alert to face a possible new wave of Hamas attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian sources in Gaza today offered some
clues about the man who gave Ayyash the booby-trap telephone.
</P>
<P>
They named a Hamas activist, Usma Hamad, a member of the
family in whose home Ayyash was believed to have hidden. It is
unclear whether Hamad has disappeared or has been arrested, they
said.

<HEADLINE> Bank Chief Warns of Pay Rise Threat to Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England Governor
Eddie George warned Friday that escalating pay deals threatened
to push up inflation and jeopardize further interest rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the BBC Friday, George warned high-profile
companies against large wage settlements, particularly in January,
the traditionally crucial month for settling wage claims.
</P>
<P>
George's warning came a day after unions at Vauxhall voted to
reject a 4.5 percent pay rise. Unions at Ford, often seen as a
benchmark for the rest of the industry, are currently balloting on
a strike aimed at a 10 percent wage rise.
</P>
<P>
He noted that while some wage settlements may be justified in
the context of a particular company, they can be taken as a kind
of lead for others where they wouldn't be justified.
</P>
<P>
The governor's comments fuels suspicions in the City that the
Bank will resist further interest rate cuts until impact of
January's wage deals and other economic trends becomes clear.
</P>
<P>
Though the governor and the Chancellor presented a united front
over the recent interest rate reduction, George predicted that
there would be disagreements in the future, and reiterated that
the Chancellor had taken a "risky" move in rejecting the Bank's
request for a rate rise in the summer.

<HEADLINE> Indian Scientists Develops Software to Monitor Cancers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Exploiting recent advances in
computer science and medical research, Indian scientists have
designed an intelligent cancer detection system which helps screen
tumors of various organs on a mass scale, the Press Trust of India
reported today.
</P>
<P>
While a software for cervical cancer detection is ready,
another one that diagnoses breast cancer is presently undergoing
clinical validation.
</P>
<P>
The third, a mass scale detection kit for oral cancer is in the
advanced stage of development, Lazar Mathew, director of defense
bio-engineering and electro-medical laboratory (DEBEL), Bangalore,
said.
</P>
<P>
Cancers of cervix, mouth and breast were the most common form
of tumors found in India, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mathew said this advanced image analysis technology uses a
computer connected with a camera to monitor abnormal or malignant
growth in organs.
</P>
<P>
When a slide made up of blood sample was transferred to the
computer through the camera, the specially-designed software will
distinguish tumor cells from normal ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
While the technology is the same for detecting all tumors,
software changes from one cancer to another because of difference
in tissues present in various organs.
</P>
<P>
Presently many simple techniques like mammography were
available for the examination of malignant growth in the breast,
but the new kit will be particularly useful in post-surgery
monitoring of metastasis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Methods available for such monitoring today are very crude and
patient has to go through painful chemotherapy or radiotherapy to
preempt the possible spread, he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand's Tourism to Gain Momentum in New Year (by Xiong Ping ) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Thailand stands to win more
tourist arrivals this year as the country looks forward to
welcoming major jubilees and international conferences over which
well-prepared tourism promotion programs are in place.
</P>
<P>
The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) has set a target to
attract 7.2 million tourist arrivals in 1996 and reap 201.6
billion baht (about 8 billion US dollars) in tourism.
</P>
<P>
To achieve this target, the TAT has planned to launch a series
of promotion campaigns, especially on the 50 anniversary of King
Bhumibol Adulyadej's ascension to the throne.
</P>
<P>
King Bhumibol was ascended to the throne on June 9, in 1946.
The TAT and hoteliers will make special offers to tourists on the
day this year. Tourists born on June 9 will get a free room on
that day and many restaurants are also expected to give discounts.
</P>
<P>
The TAT, the Thai Hotels Association, the Thai Airways
International and other tourism related companies will join hands
this year to launch the 'home coming' package program to encourage
Thais living aboard to return to their homeland for the royal
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The 700 anniversary of the founding of Chiang Mai, one of the
oldest towns of Thailand and a famous tour attraction in the
country, will be another major event for Thai tourism business
this year.
</P>
<P>
Many large international conventions to be held in Thailand,
including the Asia-Europe Summit scheduled for March 1-2 in
Bangkok, are also expected give a boost to the country's tourism
and tourism-related businesses.
</P>
<P>
There are 49 large international conventions planned in
Thailand this year, involving at least 35,000 foreign delegates,
10,000 of them will be participants to rotatory annual
international meetings.
</P>
<P>
These conventions are expected to boost Thailand's revenues in
tourism as the participants' spending per head is three times that
of ordinary tourists.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been enjoying a boom in tourism over the past
years, with 5.1 million tourist arrivals in 1992, 5.8 million in
1993, and 6.2 million in 1994, most of them came from East Asia,
Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Tourist arrivals has exceeded 5 million during the first nine
months of 1995 and the TAT's projection for the whole year is
around 6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's promotion programs this year mainly target tourists
aged over 50, honeymoon couples, families with four members
staying in the same room. The authority has allocated at least 95
million baht (3.8 million dollars) for these programs.
</P>
<P>
The authorities are confident that Thailand will see rich
returns for tourism and related industries in 1996.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa and his accompanying delegation left here today heading for
the Yemeni capital of Sanaa for a one-day visit to Yemen and
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving, Moussa told reporters that he would convey two
messages from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to his Yemeni
counterpart Ali Abdullah Saleh and President Isayas Afreworki of
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
He said his mission was aimed at stopping the escalation of the
Yemeni-Eritrean dispute over the Greater Hanish island in the
southern part of the Red Sea.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Assistant Secretary General of the Yemeni People's
General Congress Party Abdul-Malek Mansour hailed the efforts made
by Egypt to contain the Yemeni-Eritrean row over the disputed
island.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the correspondent of the Voice of Arabs
radio of Egypt, the Yemeni official said Egypt has the ability of
drawing up a formula for settling the dispute.
</P>
<P>
As for the Ethiopian initiative, no progress has been made
towards resolving the crisis due to unacceptable conditions made
by Eritrea, Mansour pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He underlined his country's stand on the issue saying that the
situation in the Greater Hanish island must return to what it was
on December 15 before sitting around the negotiating table.

<HEADLINE> Report: Iran Has 266,000 Child Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- High inflation and low income
have forced 266,000 children aged between 10 and 14 to abandon
schooling and turn into laborers in Iran, a press report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Many of them are toiling in jobs in harsh working environments
that they can incurably scar a child's psyche forever, according
to the Persian daily Hamshahri.
</P>
<P>
The daily also carried pictures of two child laborers selling
candies and small coffee tables on the streets of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The labor law in Iran prohibits employers from hiring children
under 15 years old. But the reality is something else.
</P>
<P>
A shop owner on Laleh-Zar street told Xinhua that most shops
and workshops would prefer to hire child laborers.
</P>
<P>
"They are easy to hire, and easy to fire," he said.
</P>
<P>
Many of the child laborers are former farm boys from the
countryside. They flock to the capital, the center of commerce, in
order to support their large families back in their villages.
</P>
<P>
The daily also carried an interview with Aziz Jamshidi, a
child laborer who earns 30,000 Rials (10 dollars) a month by
working at a cobbler's shop in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
"I am 12 years old. Before coming to this shop, I used
to help my father at his farm with his cattle," Jamshidi
told the daily.
</P>
<P>
He said he is from Yush, a village in Iran's northern province
of Mazandaran. His father wants him back with his savings by
spring when his sister Golbahar is expected to get married.
</P>
<P>
"Father has said that I am supposed to save 200,000 Rials
(65 dollars) by spring. You know Golbahar is getting married,"
he told the daily.
</P>
<P>
According to Iran's tradition, a bride's family has to pay for
the appliances and household items in her new home. The tradition
has been a heavy burden on the poor who can hardly make ends meet,
let alone save money for the dowry.
</P>
<P>
"Mom is working to prepare the dowry. Father, too, is
working hard to come up with some money. I am happy to
help my sister," Jamshidi said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had saved 100,000 Rials (32 dollars) and
would save the rest in the coming month.
</P>
<P>
Jamshidi said that it was difficult for him to be away from his
family.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, sometimes I cry. But I know I have no choice," he
added.
</P>
<P>
It is a sad story not only for Jamshidi but also for many
ordinary working people, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
In Iran, workers and 90 percent of government employees earn
about 250,000 to 300,000 rials (less than 100 dollars) a month on
average, but each of them has to support three or four members in
the family.
</P>
<P>
As Iran has run into a serious economic crisis because of
drastic drop in oil revenues and high volume of foreign debts,
inflation becomes the biggest problem in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a poll conducted by the government-owned daily
Iran, over one third of Tehran's residents have said that they
view inflation and economic hardships as Number one problem in
the capital city.

<HEADLINE> One-Month Ban on Coast Shrimp Catches in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government imposed
a ban on deep sea shrimp catches during the high breeding season
from January 15 to February 15 to check gradual depletion of
mother shrimps.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be carried out by the Ministry of Fisheries
in cooperation with the newly formed coast guard, sources in the
ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
Indiscriminate fishing of mother shrimps in the high seas has
threatened the existence of shrimps in the Bay of Bengal.
</P>
<P>
The government took a decision to ban the coast shrimp catches
last year, but the ban was not implemented for the lack of proper
facilities to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
The order would now be enforced with the help of the Bangladesh
Coast Guard, which began its operations last month.

They told the president that Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia's
insistence on not resigning had created a stumbling-block in
resolving the present political impasse, further deepening the
crisis and pushing the country towards confrontation.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, you immediately ask the prime minister to step down
in the great interest of the nation and shortly after her
resignation you take necessary measures for formation of a neutral
non-party caretaker government," the AL leaders urged.

<HEADLINE> Indian Economy Shows Signs of Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Indian bankers and economists
believed that the country's economy has started emitting
unmistakable signals of an incipient recession, The Hindustan
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
They feared that if the trend were not checked now the
situation would bloom into a full-fledged recession in two or
three months and completely undermine the growth momentum of
previous years.
</P>
<P>
Every possible indicator of the economy is sending out loud and
clear signals of this incipient recession, they pointed out.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the inflation rate declined to 6.71 percent
during the week ending December 16 because the supply of funds to
industry and trade was choked by the Reserve Bank of India's
imprudent fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
Another factor that contributed to bringing down the inflation
rate to an all time low was the reduced inflow of funds from
abroad as foreign financial institutions decided to hold their
funds till the political uncertainty cleared up.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said no sizable investment is expected till the
elections are over.
</P>
<P>
The threat of recession is feared to undermine the growth rate
of the gross domestic product (GDP) in the current fiscal year
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
If the situation is not brought under control right now, the
GDP may fall below six percent compared to 6.2 percent achieved in
the financial year 1994-95, the bankers and economists warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (xinhua) -- About 50 people have been killed
in a cholera outbreak in Sabo area of Ibadan, capital of Oyo
state, southwest Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic started in the Hausawa community of the area on
December 15, 1995 and claimed lives of about 16 children and
grown ups within a week.
</P>
<P>
However, the community did not take cognisance of the outbreak
at the initial stage.
</P>
<P>
The head of Hausawa community Alhaji Ahmed d. Zugeru confirmed
that about 50 people have been certified dead while about 30 were
till being hospitalised at various hospitals in Ibadan
metropolis.
</P>

The head was quoted today by the local newspaper "Weekend
Third Eye" as saying that the situation came to his notice about
two weeks ago and he immediately informed the secretary of the
Oyo state government.
</P>
<P>
He added, "the outbreak of cholera in this area could easily
be traced to the dirtiness of our surrounding and lack of public
toilets which we have been seeking the assistance from the local
government."
</P>
<P>
Well water is commonly used in the area but they are not
sanitised by all people.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Agricultural Exports Up Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The value of Zimbabwe's
agricultural exports last year rose from previous year's 5.97
billion Zimbabwe dollars (more than 600 million US dollars) to
6.24 billion Zimbabwe dollars (650 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
This was achieved despite the reduced tonnages exported as a
result of the drought, said Minister of Agriculture of Zimbabwe
Denis Norman Friday.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the firm prices for most agricultural products
particularly tobacco, horticulture and cotton lint, helped the
country to marginally increase the value of the agricultural
exports.
</P>
<P>
The minister was optimistic that this year would result in
higher tonnages which will improve the export performance.
</P>
<P>
In his new year message to the agricultural industry, Norman
said the government remained committed to supporting the farming
sector through positive policies that will ensure continued
growth of the sector which is vital for the performance of the
whole economy.
</P>
<P>
he thanked all farmers and other participants in the
agricultural industry for their sterling performance during 1995
which he said was a difficult year indeed.
</P>
<P>
Norman said as 1996 has started on a bright note he hoped that
the current optimism will be supported by good rains throughout
the remaining months of the season.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to rebuild grain stocks this year in
order to retain a reasonable level of food security.
</P>
<P>
Besides the problems of the drought, farmers were constrained
by the prevailing high interest rates. To alleviate some of the
problems, the government introduced various schemes such as the
crop pack program for smallholder farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
A total 46,214 tons of seed and fertilizer valued at 164.7
million zimbabwe dollars (more than 17 million US dollars) had
been distributed by end of last month, he added.

<HEADLINE> Afghan High-Level Delegation to Visit Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government has
agreed to send a high-level delegation here in the next few days
to discuss the strained Pak-Afghan relations, said the local press
today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at talks between Abdur Rasool Sayaf,
a close ally of Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, and senior
Pakistani intelligence officials, at the border town of Torkham on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The delegation would visit Islamabad in "the next few days,"
sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The talks were the first official contact between Kabul and
Islamabad since the burning down of the Pakistani embassy in Kabul
on September 6 last year.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan evacuated its embassy staff from Kabul and expelled a
number of Afghan diplomats in retaliation for the attack.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a four-party alliance of the Supreme Coordination
Council, the main opposition in Afghanistan, rejected Iran's offer
for holding a grand moot in Tehran of all the warring factions.
</P>
<P>
The council decided not to take part in any meeting in other
countries unless the warring factions agreed to hold a meeting
inside Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban religious student movement has not yet responded to
the Iranian offer for such a conference, while the Afghan
government has given a positive response to the offer.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been engaged in a series of efforts to bring peace and
stability to the war-torn country in the last few months.

<HEADLINE> EU Has Fewer Cattle but More Beef </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) countries
raised a total of 86.5 million head of cattle in 1995, 300,000
fewer than in 1994, but beef output rose 2.5 percent over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics released by the European Statistics
Bureau show that the growth rate of beef output will slow down
this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the amount of beef cattle in the EU countries fell
while the number of breeding stock cattle and calves rose slightly
over 1994.
</P>
<P>
France, one of the main cattle producers, saw 170,000 fewer
cattle raised on farms. The number of cattle raised in The
Netherlands and Italy also dropped sharply.
</P>
<P>
There were 410,000 more young cows raised in EU states last
year, while the head of dairy cattle went down by 430,000.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest data of the Commission of the European
Union, 20.4 percent of the 28 million calves in the EU are kept
for meat each year. The total veal output in the EU was 807,000
tons, most of which are produced by France (266,000 tons), Italy
(194,000 tons) and The Netherlands (194,000 tons).
</P>
<P>
The commission said veal consumption fell from 2.8 kilograms
per capita in 1987 to 2.3 kilograms per capita in 1994. The
biggest veal consumer countries are France, Italy and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Gascoigne Facing Further Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Rangers' controversial midfielder
Paul Gascoigne will bwgin a two-match suspension later this month
after a stormy match with Aberdeen at Ibrox in November.
</P>
<P>
He was given a one-match suspension after escaping action by
the match referee and 12 disciplinary points went against his name
after a special hearing by the Scottish Football Association.
</P>
<P>
Now yellow cards in his last two matches have taken the 4.3
million pound (about seven million U.S. dollars) Rangers star
over the 16-point threshold for the second time since arriving
from Lazio last summer.
</P>
<P>
He will miss the premier division match against Hearts at Ibrox
on January 20 and the start of Rangers's Scottish Cup campaign a
week later.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne collected one point for last Saturday's controversial
booking by Troon referee Dougie Smith against Hibs, when he was
cautioned after pretending to book himself with the yellow card
dropped by the official.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's booking in the 0-0 draw with Old Firm rivals
Celtic, for a late tackle on Celtic's Tosh McKinlay, will take
Gascoigne to the SFA limit.
</P>
<P>
Gascoigne has already served two one-match suspension in
Scotland and was red-carded when Rangers met Borussia Dortmund in
the Champions' League in December.
