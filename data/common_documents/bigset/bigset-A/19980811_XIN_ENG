<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Contacts Going on, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators continued contacts by telephone Monday but a senior
Israeli official said significant progress could be at least a
couple of weeks away.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu, was quoted by Israel Radio as saying that the
negotiations on the second redeployment would not possibly
achieve important progress within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The reason, he said, was that the Palestinian National
Authority President Yasser Arafat would be on a visit to South
Africa this week and Netanyahu would take a week-long vacation
starting next Monday. Arafat left for South Africa earlier Monday,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Telephone contacts between Israeli and Palestinian negotiators
have been going on since the last face-to-face meeting broke up
without progress last Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected the latest Israeli proposal put
forward on that meeting, describing it as "very far from"
consistent with the U.S. initiative which calls on Israel to
withdraw from an additional 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has written at least two letters to the Clinton
administration in the last few days, urging it to make public its
initiative, which was accepted by the Palestinians but rejected by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have opposed the Israeli idea that 3 percent
of the 13.1 percent due to be handed over to them by Israel be
designated as a "nature reserve" where the Palestinians will only
have limited powers.
</P>
<P>
Although the Palestinians have not suspended the meeting as
threatened if the Israelis did not present new proposals
conforming with the U.S. initiative, the Israelis have failed to
manage person-to-person talks with the Palestinians since the last
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said some progress had been made in the telephone
contacts between the two sides, but it did not elaborate.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 10 (Xinhua) -- One member of the Israeli allied
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed Monday by a roadside bomb in
south Lebanon, the state-run National News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The militiaman was killed when a remote-controlled bomb went
off as his patrol passed in the Krum al-Arz area in the central
sector of the Israeli occupied south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed
responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
In response, two Israeli warplanes fired four rockets on hills
near the village of Mashghara, a Hezbollah stronghold in the
country's western province of Bekaa, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Sunday night, an Israeli soldier and an SLA member were
wounded during skirmishes with Hezbollah guerrillas in the
occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border attack by Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting against the Israeli
occupation.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Hold Int'l Conference on Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe will host an
international conference on land reform in September, Zimbabwean
Foreign Minister Stan Mudenge said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing members of the diplomatic corps in the country on the
land reform program, the foreign minister said that his
government would go "full blast" with the resettlement exercise
in September.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge also announced that the Zimbabwean government would
host the much-awaited International Pledging Conference on Land
from September 9 to 11.
</P>
<P>
He said the entire resettlement exercise would require at
least 1.9 billion U.S. Dollars over a five-year period and the
government was soliciting resources from the international
community to enable it to carry out the program.
</P>
<P>
"After the conference we will have an invigorated and enhanced
land resettlement program," Mudenge told about 25 diplomats
accredited to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would require about one million
hectares of land a year to resettle the land-hungry people over
the five years.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge assured the foreign envoys that the resettlement
program would be "absolutely" transparent.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Zimbabwe's traditional donors and other
organizations that have been invited to the pledging conference
had accepted that the land reform program must be carried out.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that the international community has seen the
justice of our case," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said even the British government supported the land
reform program but has expressed its comments on how this should
be done.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean minister said a policy document on the land
reform and resettlement program would be ready by the end of this
week and copies would be given to all diplomatic missions in
Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Promises to Help Ensure Iranians' Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Monday assured Iran
of its "fullest cooperation" in ensuring the safety of the
latter's diplomats trapped in northern Afghanistan during the
latest attack by the Islamic Taliban militia on the rival Northern
Alliance.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan will continue to extend full cooperation to the
Iranian government in securing the safety and safe return of all
Iranian nationals including their consulate staff at
Mazar-e-Sharif," said an official press release issued here Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
However, Pakistan refuted Iran's accusations that Pakistan was
supporting the Taliban in storming Mazar-e-Sharif, the
headquarters of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Pakistan will continue to extend all
possible assistance to the Iranian government in this matter but
it could not be held responsible for events taking place in
Afghanistan," the release said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came after nine Iranians stranded in
Afghanistan's northern province of Bamiyan were flown into
Islamabad aboard a U.N. special flight. However, it is not clear
whether these Iranian officials were members of the Iranian
consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Pakistan, as a gesture of goodwill and
friendship toward Iran, immediately agreed to facilitate the
arrival of these Iranian nationals regardless of whether some of
them might be traveling without documents," the release added.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi requested
Pakistan to help ascertain the whereabouts and ensure the welfare
of 11 of his country's consulate personnel in Mazar-e-Sharif,
around 300 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan recognizes the Taliban regime while Iran accepts the
Northern Alliance government led by former Afghan President
Burhannudin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
However, the two countries have recently joined hands in
seeking a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan. Analysts here
say the new offensive by the Taliban will undermine the fragile
mutual trust between the two neighboring countries on the
Afghanistan issue.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Mediators Head for G. Bissau </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A mediation team of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has left for Guinea
Bissau Sunday from Gambian capital Banjul, a report reaching here
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the ECOWAS team headed by Amara Essy, the
foreign minister of Cote d'Ivoire, would stay in Bissau for one
day.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Bissau, the ECOWAS held a talk with
mediators of the Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, who
had brokered a peace negotiations between the rival parties in
Guinea Bissau Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the ECOWAS mediators were told to
build on the ceasefire that has largely held since July 26 by
troops loyal to President Joao Bernado Vieira and the rebels led
by former Chief of Army Staff, General Ansumane Mane.
</P>
<P>
General Mane led the rebel in early June after he was sacked
by President Vieira for neglect of duties in connection with
serious smuggling involving the army. Serious fighting had been
going on in several parts of the country before a truce was
reached.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's talk was held on a Portuguese naval vessel
Corte-Real off Guinea.
</P>
<P>
The report said the rival parties made no breakthrough in the
talk but agreed to meet again on August 18 and 19 in nearby Cape
Verde.
</P>
<P>
Cape Verde Foreign Minister Jose Luise de Jesus, who is
coordinating the Portuguese-speaking countries' mediation
efforts, said that the talks made some progress but effort is
still needed to consolidate on the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Rebel spokesman Zamora Indunda was quoted as saying that
representatives of the rival parties talked face to face on the
naval vessel.
</P>
<P>
"We started late and were far from finishing the talks, that
is why we agree to hold another round of talks," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the rebels could not agree on the conditions for
opening the airport.
</P>
<P>
Essy, the foreign minister of Cote d'Ivoire said both
mediation missions of the ECOWAS and that of the Portuguese
speaking countries share a common goal, that is, "peace and
stability in Guinea Bissau."
</P>
<P>
But he said the rebels have resisted an ECOWAS role because
two of its members, Senegal and Guinea, had sent troops to help
President Vieira.
</P>
<P>
Essy also said the ECOWAS and Portuguese-speaking mediators
would meet before the next round of talks in Cape Verde to work
out a common strategy to solve the crisis in Guinea Bissau.
</P>
<P>
ECOWAS had earlier rejected the Portuguese-speaking
community's request, saying that it should stay away from the
crisis. It also threatened to embark on sanctions and embargoes
and even military interventions if dialog and negotiations fail
to end the crisis.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM Accepts Water Minister's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister
Abdul-Salam Majali Monday accepted the resignation of his water
minister caught in the recent polluted water incident.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Water and Irrigation Munther Haddadin presented his
resignation two days after King Hussein of Jordan criticized the
government as "being lax in carrying out its duties and
responsibilities," especially over the incident.
</P>
<P>
Foul-smelling and murky tap water appeared in western Amman on
July 5, leaving some people hospitalized after drinking the
water. Panic was caused in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Haddadin's ministry carried out its own investigation
immediately and brought the situation under control a few days
later. But it failed to provide details about how the pollution
happened and could not specify the pollution source.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the PM's acceptance of the resignation, Deputy
Prime Minister for Service Affairs and Minister of Information
Affairs Abdullah Ensour told reporters "We think the resignation
came in proper time." But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Agricultural and Water Committee under
the Lower House of Parliament, which was established to supervise
the government's work in the fields of agriculture and water,
demanded the resignation and trial of Haddadin and other
government officials for their role in "causing the problem."
</P>
<P>
A coalition of the kingdom's opposition parties, including the
powerful Islamic Action Front, on Friday even called on the whole
cabinet to resign over the water incident.
</P>
<P>
A special commission was established by the government on
Tuesday to find the pollution source and spot the persons
responsible for this incident. The results are expected on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Agricultural and Water Committee once concluded that the
pollution was caused by the extra quantity of algae and halogen
elements in the water from the Lake Tiberias and the Yarmouk
River, two water sources bordering Israel.
</P>
<P>
Haddadin was appointed as minister in March 1997 when Majali
established his cabinet. Haddadin was a main negotiator during the
talks between Jordan and Israel before a bilateral peace treaty
was signed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Jordan was allowed to store 50 million
cubic meters of its water in the Lake Tiberias each winter
and then reclaim it in summer.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Issue ECOMOG Memorial Stamps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Postal Service is to
issue a set of two-piece memorial stamps to commemorate the
eighth anniversary of the ECOMOG, which has been playing a major
role in peacekeeping in west Africa.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the development, Defense spokesman Colonel Godwin
Ugbo told Xinhua that the stamps will be issued publicly at a
ceremony to be presided by Head of State General Abdulsalam
Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony will be held in capital Abuja or Lagos at a date
yet to be decided, he said.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Ugbo said the stamps will be denominated at 30 and 40
Naira (one U.S. Dollar equals about 85 Naira), respectively.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG was formed in August 1990 following the breakout of
the Liberian civil war. Though vehemently resisted in the
beginning, especially by then warlord Charles Taylor, it
eventually succeeded in its mission, with Taylor himself elected
president of Liberia in 1997.
</P>
<P>
From May 1997 to March 1998, ECOMOG also helped restore the
power of the elected Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah,
who was ousted in a coup last May.
</P>
<P>
West African countries are now considering the possibility of
converting ECOMOG into a permanent sub-regional peacekeeping
force, with certain form of logistics support from the
international community.

<HEADLINE> UN Population Fund Asks Nigeria Not to Depend on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population
Fund (UNFPA) has asked Nigeria to be less dependent on donor
assistance in implementing its national population program.
</P>
<P>
"If well managed, Nigeria has enough resources to guarantee
its citizens' quality lives and therefore, should not over-rely
on donors for the execution of its various programs," said Bill
Musoke, UNFPA representative in the most populous African
country, at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's population was estimated by the U.N. at 121.8
million in June this year. It is expected to be 150.3 million by
the year 2010 and 203.4 million by 2025.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNFPA official, such total reliance could
severely affect programs that have been on course if donors
decide to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)
was formerly involved in the reproductive health and family
planning activities in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
USAID pulled out of the country in 1994, following the
political crisis created by the annulled presidential election in
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Musoke said that people who are at the center of population
and sustainable development must also play an active role in
bringing about the desired changes instead of leaving everything
in the hands of the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNFPA representative called on policy makers to
ensure a more effective management of resources and find answers
to the management problems as the world population heads for six
billion next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the increased level of awareness in population
activities in Nigera, he said that the annual growth rate of 2.8
percent was still too fast for its size and the level of the
management of available resources.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for Defusing Iraq-U.N. Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan on Monday urged all
concerned parties to help defuse the ongoing confrontation between
Iraq and the United Nations over the U.N. weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference here, Jordanian Deputy Prime
Minister for Service Affairs and Minister of Information Abdullah
Ensour warned that if the confrontation was not contained, it might
escalate and lead to military or non-military actions against Iraq
by the U.N. or the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said that any such actions would have serious consequence
not only on Iraq itself but also on the whole region. The Iraqi
people as well as the whole region would pay the price for such
actions.
</P>
<P>
So Jordan is against such actions on Iraq in this regard, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said last week that it would suspend cooperation with the
U.N. Special Commission for dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, or UNSCOM, after their talks broke down last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Iraq took the action in protest against what it called the
UNSCOM's attempt to deliberately prolong the U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq since its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last Thursday denounced the Iraqi
decision as "totally unacceptable."
</P>
<P>
A similar crisis between Iraq and the U.N. earlier this year
brought the sides to the brink of a military confrontation, as the
U.S. and Britain built up their military presence in the Persian
Gulf to force the Iraq to comply with the U.N. inspection.
</P>
<P>
The confrontation was only averted at the last moment by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who paid a visit to Baghdad to
reach a deal on continuing the weapons inspection.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, which has maintained relatively warm ties with Iraq,
has been calling for peaceful negotiations to solve all disputes.

<HEADLINE> 192 Dead in Nairobi Bomb Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Office of President of
Kenya said Monday evening that 192 people have been confirmed
dead in Friday's bombing in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Six Kenyans working for the U.S. embassy are still missing,
said Marsden Madoka, Minister of State Office of the President,
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 5,000 were injured, 24 of them in critical conditions
and 542 hospitalized, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The rescue effort at the site is still going on well without
any interruption," it said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli rescue expert Avi Gerev said Monday afternoon that the
round-the-clock survivor-searching work will come to an end by
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 20 bodies were found from the rubbles of the ruined
Ufundi Co-op House since Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Americans were killed and another 15 wounded during the
bomb blast in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Julian Bartley, the Consul General of the U.S. embassy in
Kenya, had the highest position among the dead, half of them
women.
</P>
<P>
Neither the U.S. embassy nor the Kenyan police revealed any
development of their investigation of the car bomb blast, the
worst one in the Kenyan history.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses claimed that they saw a covered van, three
Arab-looking men and heard several gunshots when a huge car bomb
blew up.
</P>
<P>
A wounded woman at the Nairobi Hospital said that just minutes
before the bombing, she, sitting in her car parking meters away
from Ufundi House, saw three Arab-looking men with a Mitsubishi
Canter van trying to enter the parking place between the U.S.
Embassy and the Co-op House.
</P>
<P>
The East African weekly newspaper reported Monday: "Both
Kenyan police and U.S. Embassy officials agreed that the vehicle
used in the bombing was a covered pick-up van and that at least
three 'Arab-looking men' were involved."
</P>
<P>
The report quoted some witnesses as saying that there was an
exchange of gunfire between the terrorists who jumped out of the
van and U.S. marines. Another man remained in the vehicle.
Shortly afterwards the bomb detonated.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said Sunday that the Kenyan
police were pursuing several clues on the blast but withheld
details.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of experts from the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) have arrived in Nairobi to probe into the
explosion.
</P>
<P>
U.S. embassy spokesman Bill Barr said earlier that the U.S.
administration will cooperate with Kenya in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
Following the bombing, the Kenyan government has taken
measures to boost security in all diplomatic areas, airports,
seaports and other entrances of the east African country.

AMMAN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Monday condemned as
"criminal and cowardly acts" the bombing attacks on the
U.S. embassies in the capitals of Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The condemnation was made by Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister

</P>
<P>
Ensour said that Jordan condemns any kind of violence,

Up to 200 people have been killed and about 4,000 others
injured in the two explosions, which occurred minutes apart in
Kenya's capital Nairobi and Tanzania's capital Dar es Salaam last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
No one has so far claimed responsibility for the bombings, but
the suspicions were directed at terrorists in the Middle East, who

<HEADLINE> Commonwealth to Hold CMAG Meeting on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The eight-nation Commonwealth
Action Group (CMAG) is expected to hold talks in London in
October, discussing how to deal with Nigeria, whose commonwealth
membership has been suspended for three years.
</P>
<P>
Commonwealth diplomats were quoted by Reuters as saying Monday
that the Action Group could invite a Nigerian delegation to the
London talks but made it clear the country would stay suspended
from the 53-nation grouping.
</P>
<P>
The CMAG, comprising Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Botswana,
Barbados, Malaysia, Zimbabwe and Ghana, last month welcomed new
Nigerian leader General Abdulsalam Abubakar's plan to restore
civilian rule by the end of next May and the release of some
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
A Commonwealth spokesman refused to give the specific date but
noted the CMAG meeting was likely to take place some time in
October.
</P>
<P>
"Waiting until October makes sense because it gives us more
time to see if Abubakar will live up to his promises," said a
Commonwealth diplomat.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Nigeria was suspended from the grouping of
mainly former British colonies in 1995 after it executed nine
minority activists.

<HEADLINE> Survey Indicates Gloomy Outlook for UK Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The outlook for Britain's economy
is gloomy with companies heading for a major slump in profits,
according to a survey of investment experts in London.
</P>
<P>
The poll suggested that prospects for the British economy have
worsened sharply in the past month and financial institutions are
selling shares, said local media reports.
</P>
<P>
The research conducted by Merrill Lynch, the merchant bank,
found that nine out of 10 fund managers in London's financial City
believe the outlook for British business is unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
Only 3 percent expect an upturn in the UK economy over the next
12 months. That is a record low, comparing to a figure of 90
percent in 1996, when the UK economy was booming.
</P>
<P>
A BBC report quoted Trevor Greetham, global equity strategist
at Merrill Lynch, as saying, "Fund managers are bracing themselves
for a possible recession and are sellers of UK equities."
</P>
<P>
Also, a quarter of the 66 UK institutions surveyed, which
together control funds worth 2.24 billion dollars, believe that a
slowdown in the world's economy will hit UK profits significantly,
as UK corporate earnings are expected to rise by only 5 percent in
1998 and 1999, well below recent estimates.
</P>
<P>
A balance of 17 percent of UK fund managers are sellers of
domestic equities, up from 11 percent from the July survey.
</P>
<P>
However, the report offered a ray of hope for UK shares, as the
balance of British company directors are buying their own shares,
at odds to fund managers views. This indicates they are confident
that their performance will improve.

CAIRO, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has ordered a 10 percent pay rise for army and police conscripts
following their complains about low wage, the Middle East News
Agency reported Monday.

<HEADLINE> Commercial Planes and Vessels Warned Against Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 10 (Xinhua) -- One of main militia leaders
in Mogadishu Monday warned all the commercial and humanitarian
ferries and flights against the use of the air and sea ports in
Somalia's capital city.
</P>
<P>
Muse Sudi Yalahow, the militia leader, told reporters in his
temporary based in north Mogadishu that they will not shoulder
the consequences of any damage on any plane or vessel which tries
to defy what he called their ultimate and decisive warning.
</P>
<P>
The stern warning came after militiamen loyal to Yalahow had
shelled a vessel trying to dock into Mogadishu's main sea port
early Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses at the sea port, three rounds from
the Russian-made B-10 anti-tank and M-30 artillery were fired
upon the vessel.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no report of damage inflicted by any
of the fires, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
Yalahow, who belongs to the north Mogadishu dominating clan of
Abgal, also warned other main clans of the capital, the Habar
Gidir and Murusadeh supporting Hussein Mohamed Aidid and Mohamed
Qanyare Afrah, not to take part in the creation of new militia
bases in north Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
"We'll fight with all our capabilities against any such
attempts," said Yalahow who together with Osman Ali Atto and
General Mohamed Sheikh Osman denied the formation of the
administration in Mogadishu announced last Monday.
</P>
<P>
This warning was precipitated by the announcement of thousands
of militia encampment by the three faction leaders in several
parts of the capital in support for the formation of what is
called a unified strong police force for Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a large meeting was held in Huriwa
district Monday by the 16 district commissioners in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the 16 commissioners vowed to support the
recently announced administration.
</P>
<P>
"We'll support whoever is bringing us peace and life," said
Mohamed Abdulle Guled, the district commissioner of Huriwa. "We
need no more fighting, but we'll be forced to fight against
anyone seen as a threat to the stability of the capital."

<HEADLINE> Massive Release of Mink Terrorizes British County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A massive mink hunt has been
going on in Hampshire of Britain after animal rights extremists
released up to 6,000 of the vicious killers from a local fur farm,
posing a wildlife disaster and endangering local ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
Neighbors of the farm awoke Saturday morning to find mink
swarming through their gardens, stables, ponds and even in
drainpipes.
</P>
<P>
As police warned people living around Ringwood, Hampshire, to
keep pets indoors, householders already reported attacks on cats
and dogs. Experts said that birds and small farm animals were also
at risk.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have organized mink hunts and teams of trappers
tried to contain the carnage. It was estimated that some 3,000
mink remained at large by this morning.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) has told the
BBC that members of the organization were responsible for
releasing the mink, saying that the animals rights group's actions
were justified as the mink on the farm were all going to be killed
for "fur coats that nobody needs."
</P>
<P>
However, animal welfare groups generally criticized the ALF
operation, calling it "a damaging own goal," for many of the mink,
which were bred in captivity for export to the United States,
Scandinavia and Russia, would die of starvation.
</P>
<P>
Farmers were told to shoot the mink, according to PC Rob Ellis,
a wildlife liaison officer for Hampshire police. "They'll eat
anything that moves, and if cornered, they're likely to have a go
at humans too," he said. "Environmentally, it's a potential
catastrophe."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's National Phone Firm to Offer Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian Telecommunications
Ltd. (NITEL) is going into Internet services in the next few
weeks, according to a NITEL official.
</P>
<P>
Tayo Ekundayo, deputy manager of the national telephone firm,
said at the weekend that NITEL has completed arrangements for the
start of its Internet Services.
</P>
<P>
NITEL, which has already completed its two megabits per second
gateway handled by the German firm Siemens, will revolutionize
the speed and real-time delivery of Internet Services in Nigeria,
the Guardian newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ekundayo denied that NITEL wanted to edge out other Internet
Services Providers (ISP) in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
NITEL management has earlier demanded that all ISPs should pay
10,000 Naira (about 120 U.S. Dollars) monthly for each receiving
line they have subscribed to for their internet services,
otherwise they will be disconnected.
</P>
<P>
NITEL's demand is based on the fact that the over 800
telephones lines acquired individually by ISPs, under originating
and receiving calls agreement, have been converted into
"dedicated lines," contrary to the terms of agreement in their
application letters.
</P>
<P>
NITEL management, therefore, insisted that "by simply
dedicating those lines as receiver only, there is already a
violation of our agreement because our exchanges are configured
to make and receive calls and not permanently on receiver only."
</P>
<P>
Internet operators, however, challenged that elsewhere in the
world, internet service providers are even given some discounts
by telephone companies as incentives for hooking on to their
system.
</P>
<P>
"This formed the basis of petition to the head of state
against NITEL," one operator said.
</P>
<P>
NITEL management, however, argued that it is not discouraging
internet development in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Ekundayo said internet operators charge 80,000 Naira (about
940 dollars) annually on its customers in addition to usage
charges, while they only pay NITEL 105 Naira (about 1.2 U.S.
Dollars) per month for each line.
</P>
<P>
What NITEL asks from the internet operators "who hijacked so
many digital telephone lines" is only 10,000 Naira to help
maintain the lines and exchanges, said the deputy manager.
</P>
<P>
On the allegation that NITEL rakes in a substantial revenue
from internet users, he said there are corporate bodies like
hotels, banks and oil companies who pay as much as two million
Naira (about 24,000 U.S. Dollars) a month per telephone line.
</P>
<P>
He further said that some internet operators have already
complied with NITEL's directive, so there is no reason why others
should decline.
</P>
<P>
However, Toyin Ogunseinde, the marketing manager of Ross
Claytom, one of the signatories to the series of petitions
against NITEL, said that the Nigeria Internet Group, an umbrella
body for the operators, is only responsible to the Nigerian
Communications Commission (NCC).
</P>
<P>
If NCC is alive to its duties, it should call NITEL to order,
Ogundeinde said, adding that "we did not obtain our licenses to
operate internet services from NITEL, so we know that there will
soon be a compromise one way or the other."

<P>
LAGOS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has given
approval to a census in the year of 2001, the official News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Colonel Chris Ugokwe, chairman of the National
Population Commission (NPC) announced this in Lagos at the
weekend, while receiving a 1.8 million U.S. Dollar printer
donated by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities
(UNFPA).
</P>
<P>
Ugokwe called on the aid agencies to help the NPC conduct the
national head count, saying that the Nigerian government alone
could not afford the cost.
</P>
<P>
NAN said that Nigeria's last census was conducted in 1991,
which put the population of Africa's most populous country at
88.5 million, with an annual growth rate of about 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations puts Nigeria's population at 121.8 million
in June this year. The figure is expected to rise to 150.3
million by 2010 and 203.4 million by 2025.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Says Young People Have Critical Role to Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF) Monday challenged international policy
makers to give young people a broad role in the decision-making
process.
</P>
<P>
"Inclusion of children and adolescents in decision making
should not be on merely a token basis," UNICEF Executive Director
Carol Bellamy said. "Young people are demanding to be heard and
their participation is essential for development from now on."
</P>
<P>
"Participation by young people in policy formation at all
levels is their right," Bellamy added."The world needs to move
rapidly from seeing young people as passive recipients of welfare
to understanding their key role as agents of positive change."
</P>
<P>
Bellamy's remarks came as 400 young representatives at the
World Youth Forum in Braga, Portugal, issued urgent
recommendations to the World Conference of Ministers Responsible
for Youth, now meeting in Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy urged the Lisbon meeting to revisit plans of action
that governments pledged to support during the various
U.N.-sponsored conferences in Beijing, Cairo, Copenhagen,
Stockholm and Oslo. "All these plans of action give young people a
prominent place in the global development agenda," said Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
The UNICEF chief also called for more youth involvement in
United Nations fora. "Despite the many U.N. resolutions on youth,
only four of the 185 U.N. member states now send young delegates
to General Assembly sessions. We look forward to the day when all
nations have youth delegates."

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Russia Monday
received from the World Bank 300 million U.S. dollars as the first
part of its stabilization credit to Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass news agency quoted Vice-Prime Minister Viktor
Khristenko as saying that the first sum of the World Bank's credit
which totals 1.5 billion U.S. dollar was entered to the Finance
Ministry's accounts in the Center Bank.
</P>
<P>
Kiriyenko told reporters that the money will be used to finance
military reform and fund power-wielding structures and fulfill the
government's obligations to coal miners.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank's credit of 1.5 billion U.S. dollar is a part of
the 22.6 billion U.S. dollar aid package promised by the World
Bank, the International Monetary Found (IMF) and Japan. Russia
began to receive the aid in July this year.
</P>
<P>
A government official was cited by the Itar-Tass as saying
Monday that the country will receive the remaining two tranches of
the loan in the amount of 500 million and 700 million U.S. dollars
respectively by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The terms of the World Bank loan at this time are less liberal
than before. The principal should be repaid within seven years
with a three-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate is standard for multicurrency loans in the
U.S. dollar. Previous loans were extended to Russia for 17 years
with a five-year deferment.
</P>
<P>
The official said there will be no other investment loans to
Russia from the World Bank this year, although there is a
possibility that the bank can provide deficit-finance facilities.

PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- France was hit by an
extraordinarily strong heat wave Monday with high temperatures
which were rare in the country.
</P>
<P>
Temperature in Paris reached 36 degrees centigrade, while those
in Strasbourg and west-central Loire region attained 34.2 and 36.9
degrees.
</P>
<P>
The French people, not used to this kind of high temperature,
all sought coolness as much as possible in swimming pools, sea
beaches and lake sides.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, air pollution in all major French cities attained
the level-2 alarming point for a second consecutive day because of
the heat wave and lack of wind.
</P>
<P>
Fire brigades in Paris said they received more emergency calls
from people falling sick because of the heat.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Algeria Monday condemned the
bomb attacks on the U.S. embassies in the capitals of Kenya and
Tanzania and expressed sympathy for the families of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Making the condemnation at a press conference, Spokesman of
Foreign Ministry Abdul-Aziz Sab'e said "the criminal bombings that
targeted the two U.S. embassies aroused strong denunciation and
indignation from the Algerian government."
</P>
<P>
The horrible terrorist attacks in the two African countries
require, more urgent than any other time, international
cooperation in combating terrorism, Sab'e said.
</P>
<P>
The raging terrorist acts are threatening peace, security and
stability in various places worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
Algeria, which is waging a relentless war against terrorism,
has repeatedly called for real and effective international
cooperation to eventually uproot terrorism, Sab'e said.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that up to 200 people have been killed and over
4,000 others injured in the two explosions, which occurred minutes
apart in Kenya's capital Nairobi and Tanzania's capital Dar es
Salaam last Friday.
</P>
<P>
No one has so far claimed responsibility for the incidents, but
suspensions were directed at terrorists in the Middle East, who
have made threats against the U.S. recently.

<HEADLINE> British Scientists Reveal New Mars Rock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- British scientists announced
Monday that a meteorite found in the Sahara desert did come from
Mars.
</P>
<P>
Professor Colin Pillinger, of the British Open University, made
the announcement after carrying out a geo-chemical version of "DNA
fingerprinting" about the rock involving oxygen isotopes, the BBC
reported.
</P>
<P>
The 2.2 kg meteorite, dubbed Lucky 13 and found by a desert
prospector, could provide the next breakthrough in the search for
evidence of life on the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
Further analysis could unlock the secrets of Martian climatic
history and provide evidence of conditions capable of supporting
life, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 20,000 extra-terrestrial rocks worldwide, Lucky 13 is
only the 13th ever confirmed as coming from the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few days, scientists at the Planetary Sciences
Research Institute, of the Open University, have been examining
tiny fragments taken from the rock, which is thought to be between
1 million and 4.5 billion years old.
</P>
<P>
Mars meteorites are thought to be knocked off from the planet
millions of years ago, probably by a glancing asteroid impact.
They then drifted in space before being pulled to Earth by
gravity.
</P>
<P>
Only by checking their ratios of isotopics, chemicals with the
same atomic constituents but different weights, can scientists
determine where they came from.

<HEADLINE> Mortality Rate of Iraqi Children on Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The mortality rate of Iraqi
children continued to rise alarmingly as a result of the
continued sanctions imposed by the United Nations, the Iraqi
Health Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The statistics released by the ministry showed that 32,973
children under the age of five died in the first six months of
1998 of such curable diseases as malnutrition, diarrhoea,
pneumonia and other sanctions-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
In the first half, the average monthly mortality rate of
children under five has increased to 5,465 from 593 in the same
period in 1989 before the sanctions were imposed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statistics also showed that 45,764 Iraqis over
the age of 50 died in the first half of this year of such diseases
as hypertension, diabetes and malignant neoplasm.
</P>
<P>
The monthly mortality rate of the elderly over 50 increased
to 7,627 from 1,685 in the same period of 1989.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the U.N. imposed comprehensive economic sanctions on
Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait, banning the free sale of
oil, the lifeline of Iraq's economy.
</P>
<P>
The eight year long crippling sanctions have inflicted
incredible suffering on Iraqi people, who are facing severe
shortage of food and medicine despite the U.N. special programs
arranged to provide such humanitary aid.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions cannot be lifted unless the U.N. Special
Commission for disarmament in Iraq, known as UNSCOM, verifies
that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Suffer Sharp Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Growing fears that the Asian
financial crisis will take a heavy toll on worldwide economic
growth led to a general sharp fall in European stock markets
Monday.
</P>
<P>
London shares suffered a bad day, as the FTSE 100 closed down
92.8 points at 5587.6, having recovered slightly from a low of
5,555.9 which it hit in mid-afternoon trading.
</P>
<P>
Asian markets fell heavily overnight, spreading gloom to London
amid existing fears that the bull market in the United States was
turning bearish after its successes of recent years.
</P>
<P>
There are growing worries about the Japanese economy, with the
yen continuing to weaken against the U.S. dollar, according to
market analysts.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government's economic reforms have disappointed
the world's markets and it may be forced to step up its action to
solve the bad debt crisis that has engulfed the country's banking
system, said a BBC market report.
</P>
<P>
The release of producer price figures made little impact on the
market, with all eyes on Wednesday's release of UK employment and
earnings data.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfort, German shares slumped to their lowest close since
May, knocked by a sharp fall in shares in early trading on Wall
Street and lingering concerns about Asia.
</P>
<P>
After a day of thin trading, the 30-share DAX index finished at
5,476.25, down 104.97 points or nearly 2 percent. In electronic
trading, which continues for an extra half hour after the close of
floor trade, the Xetra DAX index ended down 137.89 points at
5,460.43, or 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, after rebounding impressively Friday, French stocks
relapsed into mid-summer blues as investors continue to worry
about the outlook on Wall Street and the weak yen.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip CAC-40 index closed down 102.43 points, or 2.53
percent, at 3,939.45. Volume was a meager FF5.8bn.
</P>
<P>
"People can't make up their mind whether Asia's downtrend is
the prominent factor, or whether Europe's recovery is," BBC quoted
one broker as saying. "As long as people are unsure how immune the
Continental economies are, the market will remain volatile."

<HEADLINE> Bomb-hit US Embassy in Tanzania Resumes Temporary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 10 (Xinhua) - The bomb-hit embassy of
the United States in Dar es Salaam has resumed its operation at
the residence of an embassy staff, a senior official of the
embassy said Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be named, told a press
conference that the embassy was operating to deal with emergent
issues while the investigation by more than one hundred U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigation agents, bomb and forensic experts
was well under way.
</P>
<P>
But he made no comment on the reported arrest of a suspect by
the Tanzanian police.
</P>
<P>
"If any arrest is made, it's up to the Tanzanian authorities,"
said the U.S. diplomat.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that seven American staff in the embassy were
injured and none killed during the bomb attack which happened on
Friday morning at the entrance to the embassy premises.
</P>
<P>
However, the official said, seven Tanzanian workers in the
U.S. embassy, one driver, one cleaner, one gardener and four
security guards, as well as two bystanders at the reception room,
one Tanzanian and one Kenyan, were killed in the bombing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official said that the public has been invited to
provide any information concerning the perpetrators of the
bombing, especially by eyewitnesses, to the embassy at the
temporary office at No. 285, Tour Drive, in the seaward
Oysterbay, not far from the damaged premises.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that the video-monitoring system of the embassy
was working at the time when the bomb, believed to be hidden in a
water tanker belonging to the embassy, went off at around 10:45
a.m. Friday local time (0745GMT). But he declined to give any
details.
</P>
<P>
The bombing has claimed 10 lives and injured more than 70
Tanzanian civilians by Sunday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Albright Announces Reward for Information on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright Monday announced a reward of up to 2 million dollars for
information leading to the arrest and conviction of those who
bombed U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting of State Department employees, Albright
said the arrest of the culprits "will happen, for our nation's
memory is long and our reach is far."
</P>
<P>
She vowed that the United States "will not be intimidated" by
the blasts. "Although terror can turn buildings to rubble and
laughter to tears, it can never, will never, deter America from
its purpose or presence around the globe," she said.
</P>
<P>
She also said she would fly to Ramstein U.S. Air Base in
Germany to accompany home the bodies of Americans killed in the
explosions.
</P>
<P>
Officials said Albright would leave Washington Wednesday
morning. A ceremony marking the return of the bodies will be held
in the United States Thursday, they added.
</P>
<P>
More than 180 people, including 12 Americans, were killed and
5,000 injured in Nairobi, Kenya, while in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania,
10 people were killed -- none of them Americans -- and over 70
others injured.
</P>
<P>
Albright, dressed in black, said she and President Bill Clinton
were preparing a budget request to enable the State Department to
rebuild shattered embassy buildings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam
and bring more of the 280 U.S. missions and military installations
around the world to the highest security standards to protect
American diplomats and others.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press" Sunday, Albright
said the United states would retaliate if investigations show the
attacks were ordered by another country.
</P>
<P>
But she parried questions Monday from State Department
employees about possible retaliation for the bombings. "We are not
a nation that retaliates just in order to get vengeance; nor do we
forget our own legal system while searching for those who have
harmed us," she said.
</P>
<P>
State Department officials said investigators were assessing
claims of responsibility for the attacks, including from a group
signed the Army for the Liberation of Islamic Shrines.
</P>
<P>
One of the officials said the government of Tanzania had
detained three groups of suspects in the Dar-es-Salaam bombing.

<HEADLINE> UNITA Launches Attacks in Parts of Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The opposition movement National
Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) launched attacks
in some parts of the country, killing over 100 people, a local
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The vice governor of the northern Malange Province, Joaquim
Marta, announced that 100-strong UNITA soldiers at the weekend
took over Kunda-dia-base, 175 kilometers north of Malange City,
the provincial capital, killing 145 people including some foreign
citizens, the Angolan News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the UNITA troops also launched attacks against other
areas, occupying Cahombo City and Cambo Singingi Town. They laid
land mines in some places.
</P>
<P>
Marta revealed that the UNITA has occupied 13 districts
including five cities and eight towns in less than five months.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that on Saturday the UNITA troops shot three
people and wounded four others in the town of Catata in central
Huambo Province. They looted in the town and destroyed the
infrastructures there, forcing 65 teachers and more than 2,000
students to flee to the neighboring Caala City.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process stuck in stalemate in recent months
after Alioune Beye, the late United Nations special envoy to
Angola, died in a plane crash in Cote d'Ivoire on June 26.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on July 31 sent Lakhdar
Brahimi as his special representative on a one-week mission to
mediate between the Angolan government and the UNITA.
</P>
<P>
With the efforts of Brahimi, the Angolan government and the
UNITA resumed dialog on Friday after a break-off of negotiations
for two months.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Denies Sending Troops to Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
denied sending any troops into eastern part of the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) as a DRC minister had previously alleged.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the Ugandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs
said Monday that the allegations by DRC information minister that
two columns of Uganda's armored vehicles had entered DRC were not
true.
</P>
<P>
It refuted the allegation as utterly unfounded, saying that
the Congolese minister just intended to hoodwink and contradict
Uganda's principal policy of good neighborliness and
non-interference in the internal affairs of neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
Uganda shares the deep concern of the regional states on the
current conflict in the DRC and reiterates her commitment to find
a peaceful and lasting settlement to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government endorses her unequivocal support to the
decision adopted by the Harare regional summit two days ago to
set up a four-nation committee to work out modalities of a
ceasefire in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with U.S. Cable News Network (CNN), DRC
President Laurent Kabila said that the incident in eastern part
of the country is an aggression by the army of Rwanda who also
flatly refuted the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Question Urged to be Examined in Broad Context </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan hopes that the question of Kosovo will be examined not
in isolation but in a broad and regional context, taking into
account the principles of the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
His views are reflected by his latest report to the U.N.
Security Council which deliberates the matter on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report, dated August 5 and published today, covers the
developments in Kosovo in July.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the situation there is aggravated by the failure of
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and the Albanian Kosovars to
enter into serious negotiations on the future status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation or further escalation of this conflict has
dangerous implications for the stability of the region. Given the
responsibilities of the United Nations in the wider region and the
ethnic makeup in neighboring countries, I cannot but express may
alarm at this prospect," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A particularly dangerous element in the situation is the move
in certain quarters away from a willingness to search for
compromise on a basis of multi-ethnic communities," he went on to
say.
</P>
<P>
Increased heavy fighting between the Yugoslav security forces
and the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) raised the numbers
of civilian and military casualties to their highest point since
the outbreak of the conflict in February.
</P>
<P>
The unrelenting violence has led to a dramatic increase in
internally displace persons in Kosovo and with the approaching
winter, "kosovo has the potential of becoming a humanitarian
disaster", the report added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is intensifying its efforts to prevent a major
humanitarian and refugee crisis, but only 9.7 percent of
assistance requirements or 1.7 million U.S. dollars has been
pledged by donors as of July 14.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, with an area of over 10,000 square km and a population
of 2 million, is a province of the Serbian Republic in Yugoslavia.
Ethnic Albanians, making up 90 percent of the Kosovars, have
demanded independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Government stands against, holding that the
question should be resolved within the incumbent Constitution, by
providing equal rights to all its inhabitants.

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will cut short his three-day trip to the West Coast so that he
could return to Washington to meet with his foreign policy
advisers and discuss the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania,
the White House said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The president felt it was important to come back," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters aboard Air Force One. "He
was not really comfortable being out three days."
</P>
<P>
Clinton opened his trip in Louisville, Kentucky, with a
moment of silence for 12 Americans and about 200 Africans who
died in the embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
"We must be strong in dealing with this," Clinton said in a
speech. "There is no way out if we start running away from this
kind of conduct."
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. teams are now on the ground in Africa. "They are
tending to the wounded. They are providing security. They are
searching and finding evidence. We will do whatever we can to
bring the murderers to justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Clinton was expected to take part in a ceremony
on Thursday to mark the return of Americans killed in the
bombings.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Calls for Release of Detained Ethiopians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The Confederation of
Ethiopian Trade Union (CETU) Monday called upon the international
community to press the Eritrean government to release all
detained Ethiopians in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
In a written statement to all United Nations agencies,
diplomatic missions and international organizations, CETU said
that the International Labor Organization (ILO) has the
responsibility of ensuring the protection and respect for human
rights of Ethiopian nationals in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
"Since its invasion of the Ethiopian territories, the Eritrean
government has been committing atrocities against Ethiopians in
Eritrea and occupied territories including killings, kidnapings
and torture in clear violations of the international labor rights
conventions of the ILO and the United Nations Universal
Declaration of Human Rights," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said that thousands of Ethiopians who have been living in
Assab have been summarily dismissed and expelled from their
working places and evicted from their residences.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that in violation of the Convention of
Transit Trade of Land-locked States and Freedom of Transit of the
U.N. Convention of the Law of the Sea, the Eritrean government
has seized more than 135,000 tons of dry cargo and 47,000 tons of
wet cargo in the ports of Massawa and Assab.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian News Agency Monday quoted the
Ethiopians who returned here from Assab Saturday as saying that
up to seven Ethiopians die of hunger on average each day in the
port of Assab.
</P>
<P>
A total of 258 Ethiopians returned here from Assab via
Djibouti by boat Saturday, the report said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Says Tanzania Detains Bombing Suspects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The government of Tanzania
has detained three groups of suspects in the bombing of the U.S.
embassy in Dar-es-Salaam, a top U.S. State Department official
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We have just gotten word that the government of Tanzania has
announced that it has detained three groups of suspects," Susan
Rice, assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said.
</P>
<P>
The news came when a Tanzanian police chief in Dar-es-Salaam
said that "some suspects" have been arrested. But he did not
know how many or whether they were considered principal suspects.
</P>
<P>
Rice also said the United States did not know the precise
identity of those suspects or whether they will turn out to be
an important lead in the investigation into the bombing in
Dar-es-Salaam, where ten people were killed and over 70 others
injured on Friday's bombing.
</P>
<P>
Rice said Washington wants to "hear what comes out of the
suspects."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said at a meeting of
State Department employees that the United States would give a
reward of up to 2 million U.S. dollars to those that shed
information leading to the arrest and conviction of the culprits
responsible for the bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton will cut short his three-day trip
to the West Coast so that he could return to Washington to meet
his foreign policy advisers and discuss the embassy bombings.

WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Prudence Bushnell, U.S.
ambassador to Kenya, on Monday described how she and her staff
got out of the hell of a bombings that devastated the U.S.
embassy and killed more 180 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
She told ABC's "Good Morning America" that she had just
completed a news conference at a neighboring embassy building
when the bomb went off last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden I heard an explosion," she said. "That was
followed about 10 seconds later by another enormous explosion
and I found myself crouched with my hands over my head,
wondering whether this was it."
</P>
<P>
She said there was no panic following the bombing and
everyone worked together to get safely out of the badly damaged
building.
</P>
<P>
"Although there was blood all over the place, we were
bleeding all over one another, we were all together trying to
get out of this building," she told ABC.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador, who suffered minor cuts in the explosion,
hinted that structural damage likely will preclude rebuilding a
new embassy on the current site.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Executive to Take Measures to Help SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said here Tuesday
that he has devoted most of his time recently to the formulation
of measures to create an environment conducive to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
Meeting with representatives of the Chinese Manufacturers'
Association of Hong Kong, Tung exchanged views with them on ways
to provide facilitation for the SMEs in developing high
value-added activities which would create a substantial employment
base for the local work force in the future. They also discussed
short- and long-term measures to assist the SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Tung said a 2.5 billion HK dollar (320.5 million U.S. dollars)
loan facility for the SMEs is an emergency measure to ease the
credit squeeze brought about by the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He noted with pleasure that an authorized institution in the
banking sector has just signed up to participate in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
The government would review the scheme upon implementation with
a view to making it more user-friendly to both the authorized
institution and the SMEs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that the SMEs are facing several major challenges in
their long-term development. He listed the challenges as including
the need to enhance productivity through new technology, the need
for greater access to more timely market information and improved
use of such information through new technology and better trained
employees and the need to improve cost effectiveness.

<P>
GENEVA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Conference on Disarmament
decided here Tuesday to establish an ad hoc committee on the
prohibition of production of fissile material for nuclear
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the committee is to negotiate a
non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and
effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile
material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices,
said a statement issued by the 61-member disarmament conference.
</P>
<P>
Conference Chairman Mykola Maimeskul of Ukraine said that he
would continue to pursue intensive consultations and to seek the
views of the members on appropriate methods and approaches for
dealing with the issue on the cessation of the nuclear arms race
and nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc committee shall present a report to the Conference
on Disarmament on the progress of its work to launch fresh talks
on a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty before the conclusion of
1998. The conference will end its third and final part of the 1998
session on September 9.

<HEADLINE> Reporters Flock to Jiujiang to Cover Dike Breach Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- "OK, stand that way, we are
going to do a good story on you," says a television cameraman to
soldiers who are busying repairing a breach in the embankment of
the Yangtze River at Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
While thousands of soldiers are making strenuous efforts to
mend the gap in the dike embankment at this East China city,
journalists are also flocking to the scene.
</P>
<P>
"Many Chinese and overseas journalists have applied to report
from here, but some of them have been turned down for various
reasons," says Zhang Yanfang, a local official from the city
government's publicity department.
</P>
<P>
So far, 153 reporters from the local and overseas new media have
arrived in the city, according to Zhang. Meanwhile, more local and
overseas journalists are on their way to Jiujiang, he says.
</P>
<P>
"Journalists who want to stay in the city must get official
consent from the department," he says, "and they could violate
Chinese law if they move around here without official permission."
</P>
<P>
The city welcomes journalists to tell true stories about what
is going on here, he says. However, he fears too many reporters
moving about may hamper the repair efforts.
</P>
<P>
"It is good to let reporters cover the breach in the dike and
efforts to plug it," says Yang Lingling, a reporter from the
Jiangxi Television Station. "Otherwise, outsiders only have a
vague or wrong idea about what is happening here," she says.
</P>
<P>
Kou Yong, a local resident correspondent from the Beijing-based
Science and Technology Daily, says he plans to send a report in
the form of a diary to his headquarters about Jiujiang's struggle
to mend the breach.

HOHHOT, China -- Some 2,300 people have been stranded following
a breach in the dike of the Nenjiang River in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region at 10:30 this morning.
</P>
<P>
No casualties have been reported so far, according to the
regional flood control oficials.
</P>

The bust occurred at Dorbenxin in east Inner Mongolia's Jalaid
Banner (county) of Xinggan League (Prefecture). The breach is more
100 meters wide, flood water flowed over another 600-meter section
and a 1,800-meter long dike has been seriously collapsed.
</P>
<P>
The breach was caused by rampant floods on the Nenjiang River
and floodwaters coming from neighboring Heilongjiang Province,
where local dikes on the Zhuo'er River have also been breached.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 15,000 people also have been stranded Monday by
floodwaters along the Hulin River in the prefecture.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Approves Accord With Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has approved the Comprehensive Agreement on Respect for
Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law reached earlier
between the government and the leftist National Democratic Front
(NDF).
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Pasig City, Metro Manila,
Tuesday by Howard Dee, chief government negotiator with the NDF,
Dee said Estrada approved last weekend the peace agreement for
immediate implementation without reservations or preconditions.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the implementation of the agreement shall be
done in accordance with constitutional and legal processes.
</P>
<P>
Dee said the unequivocal and decisive approval of the peace
accord by Estrada is a welcome and happy development for the
Filipino people.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the government in signing the agreement is the
attainment of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace which is the
basic foundation for social solidarity, economic development and
national prosperity, Dee said.
</P>
<P>
He added that with the signing of the document, the government
and the NDF will soon reach a mutual cease-fire agreement while
peace talks are going on.
</P>
<P>
He said both negotiating panels will definitely resume their
formal talks in the first week of September this year but they
still have to determine the exact place.
</P>
<P>
Also during the press briefing, Dee said that more than 700
political detainees have already been released by the government
since the government-NDF negotiating panels met and tried to end
the more than three decades of pestering insurgency problem in
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Dee, the cases of other political detainees are
now under process and some of them will soon be released.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the signing of the peace agreement was
withheld until NDF negotiating panel chairman Luis Jalandoni was
officially informed by Dee Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The NDF, a leftist organization led by the Communist Party of
the Philippines, has been engaged in a guerrilla war against the
government since its creation in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
It began exploratory peace talks with the government five years
ago, but the two sides have so far failed to make any major
breakthrough.

<HEADLINE> British, U.S. Oil Giants Unveil Biggest Industrial Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- British Petroleum Plc (BP) and
U.S. Amoco Corp, two of world's oil giants, announced plans
Tuesday for the largest ever industrial merger which will create a
combined enterprise with a market capitalization of 110 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new oil colossus will be headquartered in London, with BP
holding 60 percent of the stock, to become Britain's biggest
company.
</P>
<P>
BP Amoco Plc, as the group will be called, will have oil, gas
and chemical operations spanning the globe. It will be headed by
BP Chief Executive Sir John Browne and the board will be
co-chaired by BP Chairman Peter Sutherland and Amoco Chairman
Larry Fuller.
</P>
<P>
The Reuters news agency quoted Browne as calling the merger "A
superb alliance of equals with complementary strategic and
geographical strength which effectively creates a new super major
that can better serve our millions of customers worldwide."
</P>
<P>
The merger will be effected by the issue of new BP shares in
the form of American Depositary Receipts, in exchange for Amoco
stock. Amoco shareholders will receive 3.97 BP ordinary shares
for each Amoco common share held.
</P>
<P>
The companies aimed to complete the merger by the end of 1998
and they did not see any regulatory hurdles, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
The merger is expected to propel the two companies into the
world's top trio of oil majors, along with Exxon and Royal
Dutch/Shell Group.
</P>
<P>
"International competition in the industry is already fierce
and will grow more acute as new players emerge," the partners said
in a statement. "In such a climate the best investment
opportunities will go increasingly to companies that have the size
and financial strength to take on those large-scale projects that
offer a truly distinctive return."
</P>
<P>
The new group, with a target of at least 2. billion U.S.
dollars extra in annual pre-tax earnings by the end of 2000, will
be the largest producer of oil and gas in the U.S and one of the
world's largest fuels marketers.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Raises Overnight Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines was on Tuesday forced to raise its overnight borrowing
rate by another three percentage points due to continuing
speculation against the Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
The borrowing rate will be higher at 18 percent from the
present 15 percent effective Wednesday, one day after the central
bank increased it to 15 percent from 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank assured that the lending rate of the bank
would be maintained at the present level.
</P>
<P>
Both Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson and President of the
Bankers Association Deogracias Vistan said the increase in
overnight rates is a temporary measure to curb speculation.
</P>
<P>
Singson reiterated that the central bank has raised its
overnight rates in order to quell speculation which continued to
be felt in the foreign exchange market Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Singson stressed that if the central bank did not raise its key
overnight rates anew, the exchange rate would have remained above
44 pesos to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But the raising of interest rates by the central bank Monday
immediately had the desired effect of siphoning off funds from the
foreign exchange market with the peso closing at 43.61 to the
greenback Tuesday, compared with Monday's closing rate of 44.18
pesos to a dollar.

NANCHANG, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The year's fourth flood crest
passed Jiujiang in Jiangxi Province of east China on Tuesday,
without any major incidents.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Jiujiang reached 22.80 meters at 3 pm on
Monday due to the flood peak, and fell to 22.77 meters at 8 pm
Tuesday. So far, the water levels at Jiujiang and Poyang Lake have
been higher than the record levels of 1954 for the past 18 days.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of local people, including soldiers, have been
working strenuously to repair a breach in the dike of the city
embankment during the past four days, and the situation was
brought under control with the completion of a 90-meter-long
cofferdam on Monday.
</P>
<P>
People are still working to further fortify the cofferdam,
according to the latest reports.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to repair the damage started shortly after a part of
the concrete embankment was breached around 12:30 pm on August 7,
four kilometers west of downtown.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang Zemin, who is also Chairman of the Central
Military Commission, ordered the army to rush to the site to help
dike-repairing efforts on the day of the breach.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji made a phone-call to city leaders on the
same day placing top priority on the lives of the local
people. Zhu visited the breach site on Sunday, and urged civilians
and soldiers working on the dike to plug the breach for the safety
of the Yangtze embankments and the people.

<P>
Vice Premier Wen Jiabao, who is also Head of the State Flood
Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, arrived in Jiujiang

<HEADLINE> Maize Production Declines in Southern Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Maize production in southern
African Development Community (SADC) countries is forecast at
about 16 million tons, a six percent decline from last season's
total harvest of 17 million tons.
</P>
<P>
According to the SADC's latest quarterly bulletin, Food
Security, released Tuesday in Harare, the production was below
SADC's five-year average production output of 17.66 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The low maize production is resulted from the fall in
production in the major maize-producing countries of southern
Africa like Zimbabwe. The low production is attributed to the
poorly distributed rains which were caused by el-nino weather
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
However, national level increases in maize production were
recorded in Angola, Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian President Stresses Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, August, 11 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Petar
Stoyanov said on Monday he hoped his Moscow tour later this month
would facilitate the growth of Bulgarian-Russian ties and the move
towards a more transparent and pragmatic relationship.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with a special working group making preparations
for his coming visit, Stoyanov said Bulgarian statesmen should
give priority to the development of relations with Moscow, Sofia's
closest ally in the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
The trip will be the first visit to Russia by a Bulgarian
president since the disintegration of the former Soviet Union in
1991.
</P>
<P>
High on Stoyanov's tour agenda is the aim to prompt prime
ministerial talks between the two countries, and to start the
operation of bilateral committees in economy and trade, science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov said the development of bilateral ties should be built
on mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and dignity, and
ways to best serve the interests of both sides.
</P>
<P>
The special working group, led by Antoaneta Primataro,
Bulgarian deputy minister of foreign affairs, and Vladimir
Filibov, secretary of foreign policy to the president, flew to
Moscow on Monday to discuss with Russia arrangements for the visit.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Bulgaria enjoyed close relations in politics,
economy and trade in the Soviet era. But Sofia has distanced
itself from Moscow in recent years as Russia was unhappy with
Bulgaria's bid for membership of the European Union and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's 1999 Budget to Be Expanded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Tuesday unveiled a draft budget of 86 trillion won (about 64.27
billion U.S. dollars) for fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
It is up 7.5 percent from this year, in a bid to increase
spending to boost the sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The budget deficit would widen next year to 24 trillion won (18
billion dollars), or six percent of the gross national product
(GNP), from 17.5 trillion won (13 billion dollars), or four
percent of the GNP, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 budget guideline, submitted to the cabinet by the
Planning and Budget Commission, calls for cutting wages of
government employees while maintaining the defense budget at this
year's level.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to issue state bonds worth 14
trillion won (10.4 billion dollars), up six trillion won (4.5
billion dollars) from this year's eight trillion won (six billion
dollars), to fill the gap between revenue and expenditure.
</P>
<P>
If an annual 12-percent interest rate is applied to the 14
trillion state bonds, the interests will amount to 1.68 trillion
won (1.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Korea Development Institute warned that widening budget
deficits would become chronic if the government depends too much
on bond sales.
</P>
<P>
In drawing up a plan for outlays, the commission said it will
focus on raising the effectiveness of expenditures through
restructuring and refraining from increasing investment.
</P>
<P>
The top budget agency said it will give high priority to
expenditure for the jobless and the poor, and to supporting
exporters and small and medium-size businesses and social
infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
However, budget requirements in other areas, including payroll,
defense, support for farmers and fishermen and education
investment, will be frozen or cut.
</P>
<P>
The commission said it will simplify wage restructuring while
strengthening incentive systems. Subsidies to state-run
departments will be reduced.
</P>
<P>
The scale of defense outlays will be determined, mostly under a
defense reform program which the Ministry of National Defense has
yet to work out, but the commission said that it plans to cut the
budget slightly.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's NGO to Help Make Poor Poverty-Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Proshika, Bangladesh's leading
non-governmental organization, has taken up a 30 billion-taka (638
million U.S. dollars) project to help 3.2 million poor people in
the country get rid of poverty in five years between 1999 and
2004.
</P>
<P>
The organization would contribute to about 20 percent reduction
of the overall poverty in Bangladesh and about 60 percent
reduction of poverty in Proshika's area development centers,
Proshika President Qazi Faruque Ahmed said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the organization's five-year plan at a discussion
on "Toward a Poverty-Free Society," Ahmed said Proshika would
expand its activities to 70 new thanas in addition to the existing
150 thanas in the country and during the plan period, it would
organize 220,000 groups in 24,000 villages and slums.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are nearly 60,000 villages under 490 thanas
in Bangladesh and Proshika works in 12,362 villages and slums
under 81,627 primary groups.
</P>
<P>
Of the total 30 billion taka, the organization would seek 20
percent of the total money from foreign donors while the rest 80
percent would come from its internal resources, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speakers at the discussion said the project is "courageous" as
the organization has prepared the plan on the basis of the
experiences it has gathered from the grassroots level during the
past two decades.
</P>
<P>
They said Proshika has made significant contributions to the
empowerment of women and the poor. In this connection, they noted
that 62 percent of the country's women are at present economically
active, which is a record in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Proshika, under its five-year plan, would emphasize
socio-economic activities, such as providing universal education,
human development training, building infrastructure for health
care service, employment and income generation, disaster
management and preparedness and natural resources and
environmental regeneration.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 50 percent of Bangladesh' 127 million people are living
in poverty, with about 80 percent of them in the countryside.

<HEADLINE> Nairobi Bomb Blast Toll Rises to 218, Probe Goes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Minister of State Office of the
Kenyan President, Marsden Madoka, said Tuesday 218 people have
been confirmed dead and more bodies are expected to be found in
the rubble of Friday's bombing in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
An official from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) said Tuesday they may issue some results from their
investigation later this week.
</P>
<P>
Madoka said the government has not worked out any explanations
on the cause of the bomb blast aimed at the U.S. embassy located
in a very busy commercial area of the Kenyan capital.
</P>
<P>
Five Kenyans working for the U.S. embassy are still missing,
said Madoka at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
A total of 4821 people were wounded, seven of them now in
critical conditions while another 244 still hospitalized. Others
have been treated and discharged.
</P>
<P>
The rescue effort at the bombing site is still on and expected
to end in the next 24 hours, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Americans were killed and another 15 wounded during the
bomb blast in Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government has set up the National
Disaster Fund for the bomb victims and he called on all Kenyans
to donate money or offer other assistance.
</P>
<P>
Madoka held talks Tuesday morning respectively with the
delegates from the European Union and the U.N. Development
Program to seek for help.
</P>
<P>
Both the Kenyan Criminal Investigation Department and the U.S.
FBI experts are intensifying their investigation of the bomb
raid. But it is believed that the probe will have to take months.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses have claimed that they saw a covered van,
three Arab-looking men and heard several gunshots when a huge car
bomb blew up.
</P>
<P>
Eye-witnesses said that just minutes before the bombing, they
saw several Arab-looking men with a canter van trying to enter
the parking place between the extensively-damaged U.S. embassy
and the totally destroyed Ufundi-Cooperative House.
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper said a seriously wounded
Kenyan guard working for the U.S. embassy has told its reporters
that local security men at the embassy confronted and fought off
five armed bombers moments before the blast went off.
</P>
<P>
Joash Okindo, a guard at the embassy said he and his
colleagues engaged the "Arab-looking men," in a brief argument
and physical confrontation that led to a shoot-out, shortly
before the powerful explosion.
</P>
<P>
He said during the confrontation, a U.S. marine approached the
Arab men, who were in the vehicle and a fire exchange ensued.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi said that the Kenyan
police were pursuing several clues on the blast but withheld
details.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Says Keen to Maintain Sudan's Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Meeting here with a leading
Sudanese opposition figure, Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Agriculture Youssef Wali said Tuesday that Cairo is
eager to maintain Sudan's unity.
</P>
<P>
Wali made the remarks following talks with John Garang, leader
of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA), who arrived here
Sunday to participate a meeting of all major Sudanese opposition
leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We discussed cooperations between the two countries within
Cairo's interest in Sudan's unity as well as Egypt's role in
relieving the sufferings of the war-wrecked south," Wali told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
"President Hosni Mubarak constantly follows up the relief
efforts in the famine-hit areas in Sudan. And this follow-up is
part of the time-honored links between Egypt and Sudan," he said.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has been fighting for autonomy of southern Sudan since
1983, and the civil war, combined with perennial famines, has
claimed more than 1.5 million lives in this african country.
</P>
<P>
Later Tuesday, Garang will meet with Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi, former
Sudanese Prime Minister and leader of the Ummah Party, and
Mohammed Osman Al-Merghani, the head of the National Democratic
Alliance, the umbrella group for northern and southern Sudanese
oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa will also meet on
Wednesday with Garang to discuss Egypt's efforts to close the gap
between Khartoum and the oppositions in a bid to end Sudan's
15-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
The meetings came after the peace talks between the Sudanese
government and the oppositions in the Ethiopian capital of Addis
Ababa ended Friday without any progress.
</P>
<P>
After four days of talks, differences remained over issues
including the cease-fire, border demarcation of southern Sudan,
the relationship between religion and state, and the referendum on
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt have long been at odds over a border dispute
and have traded accusations of harboring rebel militants and
oppositions, but a tentative thaw in relations has been emerging
between the two sides in recent months.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: China Pushing Forward Financial Reform By Xinhua Writers Pan Qing, Zhou Genliang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China announced today that
Shenzhen, a special economic zone adjacent to Hong Kong, has been
made the second city to allow foreign banks to handle Chinese
yuan-based business on a trial base.
</P>
<P>
Also, the number of foreign banks in Shanghai's Pudong New Area
to experimentally handle Chinese yuan-based business will be
increased and their business scope will be expanded, according to
the announcement.
</P>
<P>
Local financial experts speak highly of this move, calling it
an indication that China is further opening up its financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen was the first Chinese city to open an operational
foreign bank branch, since its local economy and financial sector
are linked more closely with the rest of the world, compared with
many other cities in China, according to Liu Mingkang, Deputy
Governor of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Branch of the PBOC is quite experienced in
financial supervision and management, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, China has relaxed control over
foreign banks' handling the yuan-based business for four reasons:
</P>
<P>
-- To increase the scale of its yuan business from 30 million
yuan per transaction to 100 million yuan per transaction, under
the condition that larger businesses must obtain approval from the
PBOC for each one;
</P>
<P>
-- To loosen control over these banks on interbank lending by
granting them the same treatment as their Chinese counterparts;
</P>
<P>
-- To allow these banks to handle larger transferable deposits
in Renminbi (RMB) yuan, when the proper time comes to do so;
</P>
<P>
-- To allow these banks to participate in bank consortia to
issue loans in RMB yuan.
</P>
<P>
It is an objective requirements of economic and financial
development in China to expand the business scope of foreign banks
in China, despite the current financial turmoil in the surrounding
countries, says Li Yang, director of the Finance Research
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
These moves indicate the determination and confidence of the
Chinese government to firmly open up the country's financial
sector, he said, noting this will be helpful to the in-flow of
foreign funds into China and to strengthening foreign businessmen's
confidence in the country's financial industry and the economy as
a whole.
</P>
<P>
The POBC's supervisory and managerial abilities have been
improved along with the opening up of the country's financial
sector.
</P>
<P>
Since December 1996, nine foreign banks have been allowed to
handle RMB yuan business on an experimental basis in the New
Pudong Area. These banks have been operating their RMB yuan
business well, and by the end of last June, their total RMB yuan
capital topped 1.16 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The latest measures taken by the Chinese government in opening
up the financial sector is "one of the best ways to increase the
competition and cooperation between Chinese and foreign financial
institutions," said Albert Keidel, a senior economist of the World
Bank Resident Mission in China.
</P>
<P>
It is helpful to compel Chinese financial institutions to
improve their business and service and it is "good news" and "a
step toward the right direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that by last June foreign financial
institutions have set up 178 operational bodies in China, with a
total capital of 37.4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The outstanding loans of these banks stood at 27.4 billion
U.S. dollars, accounting for one fourth of the country's total.

<HEADLINE> China's Major Power Plant Starts Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The first generator at the
Ertan Hydro-electric Power Station, the largest to be completed in
China this century, will start trial operation soon.
</P>
<P>
Liu Junfeng, general manager of the Ertan Hydro-power
Development Corporation, said today the station is the second
largest hydro-power project in China following that at the Three
Gorges of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Ertan station began on September 14, 1991.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Yalong River in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, Ertan will have 6 generating units each with a capacity
of 550,000 kilowatts, said Liu, adding that the project is
expected to be complete next year.
</P>
<P>
The Yalong River, a tributary in the upper reach of the Yangtze
River, originates in the Bayan Khara Mountains in northwestern
Qinghai Province. It flows mainly through Sichuan Province and
generators with a combined generating capacity of 24 million
kilowatts can be installed along the river.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the first generator at Ertan is so far the largest in
the country; and the second one, whose installation will be
finished in two days, will be put into operation in November.
</P>
<P>
Experts say Ertan will play an important role in boosting the
supply of electricity in western China and will aid the economic
growth of Sichuan Province, Chongqing Municipality, and other
areas in central and western China.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Opposition Denies Killing of Hekmatyar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's beleaguered
opposition denied a report Tuesday that former Afghan Prime
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has been killed in an attack in
northern Takhar province.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly deny the report, I have just talked to my boss and
he is all right," Ghairat Baheer, Hekmatyar's son-in-law and
Islamabad-based representative of Afghanistan's Hezb-e-Islami said
here.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, a foreign wire service quoted unnamed Taliban sources
as saying that three gunmen shot to death Hekmatyar, the
Hezb-e-Islami chief in Takhar amidst reports that the Taliban
militia have routed Northern Alliance troops in the provincial
capital of Taloqan.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Hekmatyar is healthy and in high spirits," Baheer said,
but declined to tell his whereabouts, only saying that "he is
inside Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar fled to Iran after the Taliban militia ousted his
government from Kabul in 1996, but he returned to help lead a
fractious coalition of anti-Taliban factions.
</P>
<P>
Ousted Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of another
anti-Taliban faction, had fought a bitter power struggle with
Hekmatyar before foes became allies to oust the Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Political Negotiations Key to Cross-straits Development: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Political negotiation is the key
to the settlement of cross-straits divergences and the development
of cross-straits relations, said Zhang Jincheng, secretary-general
of the Association for Relations Across Taiwan Straits (ARATS),
here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang, who is attending the 6th Cross-Straits Seminar on
Chinese Modernization, which ended today, made his remark in an
interview with Xinhua, adding that the conditions for political
negotiations have matured, and that those obstacles hindering
negotiations have been created by the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Some one hundred scholars, experts, and enterpreneurs from
across the straits attended the two-day seminar, discussing the
most effective means to exploit the vast and sparsely populated
western region of China.
</P>
<P>
During the seminar, more than 20 Taiwan enterpreneurs studied
the local investment situation, contacted with local economic
departments, and expressed their willingness to engage in further
negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Corn Output Seen to Decline in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' corn production
is projected to plunge further to 3.5 million metric tons in 1999
from this year's 3.8 million metric tons due to the spillover
effects of the El Nino and La Nina phenomena.
</P>
<P>
"In effect, we would have tight squeeze in domestic supply,"
Rolando Dy, economist of the Manila-based University of Asia and
the Pacific, told an agri-business forum held here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Dy said the estimate assumes a domestic demand of about 13,000
metric tons per day, which is mainly driven up by the needs of the
hog and poultry sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Agricultural Statistics earlier estimated a
12.4-percent drop in the country's corn output this year despite
the good production prospects for the second semester.
</P>
<P>
The government is currently studying the agriculture
department's proposal to import 300,000 metric tons of yellow corn
from China. The shipment will be levied a 35-percent preferential
tariff.
</P>
<P>
The corn imports are based on the projected demand for chicken,
pork and meat during the Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at a tight food supply situation at the end of
1998 and at the start of 1999," Dy said.
</P>
<P>
This is due to the severe effects of drought and floods on
major crops this year. The country's total food production is
expected to decline by about 20 percent in 1998, one of the
highest drops in history.

<HEADLINE> AL Calls for Anti-Terrorism World Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Cairo-based Arab League
Tuesday called for convening an international conference on
combating terrorism after Friday's twin bombings against American
embassies in two eastern African capitals.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the AL condemned the bombing
attacks against the U.S. embassies in Kenya's capital and
Tazania's capital Dar es Salaam, in which over 200 people were
killed and at least 5,000 others injured.
</P>
<P>
The statement expressed the AL's condolences to the victims'
families and the U.S., Kenyan and Tanzanian governments.
</P>
<P>
It said the AL supports holding an international conference
which will be devoted especially to fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The AL underlined the provisions of the Arab agreement on
fighting terrorism which was endorsed by the Arab Justice and
Interior Ministers Council in March.
</P>
<P>
The pact called for cementing international and regional
efforts to combat international terrorism which menaces the whole
world community.
</P>
<P>
So far no one has claimed responsibility for the two powerful
blasts that rocked two U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam
minutes apart Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. intelligence authorities have been conducting a
massive investigation into who was behind the two apparently
organized attacks.
</P>
<P>
The suspicions were directed at terrorists of Middle East
origins, who have issued threats against the U.S. recently.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has said that it might take a long time to
find the culprits, but promised "the appropriate action" if the
bombings were found to be state-sponsored.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the attacks, United Nations Secretary General
Kofi Annan said Tuesday the time was right for a world conference
against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is on a five-day visit to Portugal, said the
international community needed to respond to the bombings by
uniting against political terrorism.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia's blue chips went down by
10 to 15 percent Tuesday in mid-day trading in response to
downward trends on world markets, and pessimism over the country's
economy.
</P>
<P>
The RTS-Interfax Composite Index in rubles fell 9.44 percent to
a record low 27.91 points by 13:00 local time (09:00 GMT), the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The stock market was further aggravated by the government
securities market, where the annual yield shot up to 130 percent,
Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
Apprehension was also running high that the ruble would fall
against the U.S. dollar, despite government assertions that there
would be no devaluation of the national currency.
</P>
<P>
The Russian market is expected to continue slipping as no
events are in sight to push the market up.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, prices for Russian Ministry of
Finance, or OVVZ, bonds have fallen to record lows. Yields on the
third OVVZ tranche, which matures in mid-May 1999, shot up to more
than 50 percent while prices dropped by 15 percent Tuesday
compared to Monday, from 86 percent to 74 percent of face value.
</P>
<P>
Yields on Russian Eurobonds maturing in 2001 rose by a record
23.64 percent on Monday, after rising 350 basic points in the past
six days, Interfax said, quoting a report.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Gives Go-Ahead for British Telephone Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has granted a British
telecommunications giant a license for a 15-year telephone network
project worth 207 million U.S. dollars, furthering economic ties
with London.
</P>
<P>
The deal was secured during talks Monday between Tran Xuan Gia,
Vietnam's minister of planning and investment, and Brian Wilson,
British minister for trade, who arrived here Sunday for a three-
day visit.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, the Cable and Wireless company will install
250,000 telephone lines for Hanoi, Vietnam's capital city, in
cooperation with Vietnam's state-owned Post and Telecommunications
corporation.
</P>
<P>
The agreement helps lift British foreign direct investment in
in Vietnam from 13th into the top ten.
</P>
<P>
London and Hanoi have strenghtened economic links in recent
years. In July, British direct investment into Vietnam had risen
to more than 592 million dollars involving 27 projects, most of
them in the petroleum industry and in telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The two-way trade amounted to 553 million dollars last year,
with an export surplus for Vietnam of 393 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
A 14-member British economic and commercial delegation,
including business leaders from seven corporations and banks, came
with Wilson on the three-day tour, signaling London's bid to
strengthen the commercial and trade relationship with Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Genetics May Help Feed 8 Billion People in 2020: Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Gene-based agricultural
technology may help solve the problem of feeding a world
population of eight billion people in 2020, said scientists here
today at the ongoing 18th International Congress of Genetics.
</P>
<P>
The world population is expected to reach eight billion by
2020, and the annual demand for grain will increase by 50 percent,
said Gurdev S. Khush, a world renowned authority on rice
hybridization and breeding from the International Rice Research
Institute of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In the past, food production grew as a result of increased
yield potential of new crop varieties and an increases in
cultivated land, said Khush.
</P>
<P>
However, in the future, with a decrease of farmland, shortages
of water resources, and restrictions on the use of pesticide due to
concerns about their harmful effects on the environments and human
health, people will rely mainly on gene technology to breed new
crop varieties with high yields.
</P>
<P>
"I'm optimistic about the grain issue for 2020 from a
technological perspective," he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Famous Chinese geneticist Tan Jiazhen said yesterday during the
congress's opening ceremony that the answer is "yes" to the
question of whether or not the human species can ultimately
sustain itself on earth.
</P>
<P>
"Breeding and genetic improvement for new varieties of crop
plants with higher yields and better qualities is the most
effective way to assure food production keeps pace with population
growth," said Tan.
</P>
<P>
Khush said genetic engineering techniques are being applied to
increase the yield potential through modification of enzymatic
steps which lead to carbohydrate synthesis.
</P>
<P>
He added that novel genes resistant to disease and insects
have been isolated and are being introduced into crop species
through genetic engineering where they impart durable resistance.

<P>
BRUSSELS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Investment in the manufacturing
industry in the European Union is expected to increase strongly in
1998, according to a union-wide investment survey released on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the European Commission's

the increase rate at 9 percent over a year ago in real terms.
</P>
<P>
The growth of investment in the 11-country euro zone will grow
by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The result of the survey, published by the European Commission

The increase rates for France and Italy were at 8 percent and 5
percent respectively while the growth rates for last year were
both at minus 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Though slightly down, Britain also registered a high increase
of 13 percent. Its last year's investment expansion was a
percentage point higher.
</P>
<P>
The European Economy journal also said that the economic
sentiment indicator continued its positive trend in June and rose
slightly compared with a month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The economic sentiment indicator is the leading indicator for
the European communities.
</P>

JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Hoax bomb threats were to be
expected in the wake of last week's bomb blasts at United States
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, U.S. ambassador to Swaziland, Alan
MacKee said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy in Mbabane received a bomb threat by way of an
anonymous telephone call shortly after it opened Tuesday morning,
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The caller told the ambassador's secretary that a bomb was planted
in the multi-story Swaziland Central Bank. The embassy is on the first
floor.
</P>
<P>
The entire building was immediately evacuated and access roads
cordoned off.
</P>
<P>
Police bomb disposal experts with sniff dogs searched the
building and adjoining car park for over two hours but no bomb was
found.
</P>
<P>
MacKee said while such hoax calls could be expected after the
Kenyan and Tanzanian blasts, all threats had to be taken seriously.

Last week massive bomb blasts at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania killed over 200 people and injured nearly 5,000.

<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Liu Junfeng, general manager
of the Ertan Hydro-power Development Corporation, today said the
Ertan Hydro-electric Power Station has begun to block flooding on
the upper reach of the Yangtze River to help relieve the flood
pressure downstream.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Yalong River, a main tributary of the Yangtze, the
Ertan Hydro-electric Power Station has experienced three flood
crests this summer. At 2:00 am on Monday, a flood peak with a water
flow rate of 10,200 cubic meters per second passed Ertan, the
second largest peak this year.
</P>
<P>
Since May 1, the Ertan reservoir has stored 4 billion cubic
meters of water, effectively easing the water flow of the middle
and lower reaches of the Yangtze, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"Without Ertan, the Yangtze would face greater flood pressure
this year," he noted, adding that about 40 percent of the flood
water of the Yalong River has been blocked by the Ertan reservoir,
while the dam and flood-discharging facilities still under
construction have remained intact.
</P>
<P>
As China's second largest hydropower project, following that on
the Yangtze at Three Gorges, the Ertan Hydro-electric Power Station
is expected to be completed next year

<HEADLINE> Family Demands IRNA Reporter's Release by Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Family members of Mahmoud Saremi,
the correspondent of Iran's official news agency IRNA, rallied in
front of the Pakistani embassy here Tuesday morning to demand his
immediate release from the hands of Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
During the protest, a letter to the Pakistani ambassador in
Tehran Jawid Husain, was handed over to the Pakistani press
attache by Saremi's six-year-old son Sina, IRNA reported. The
letter was first read out by Saremi's brother, Hojat.
</P>
<P>
Iran said Saremi, along with 11 Iranian diplomats, were
captured Saturday after the Taliban forces conquered the northern
Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif, the main stronghold of the
opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, a student militia reportedly backed by Islamabad,
has won control over most of Afghanistan and imposed a strict
Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Saremi's family members said in the letter that the recent
statements by Pakistani officials on the latest developments in
Afghanistan prove that Islamabad plays an effective role in the
policies and actions of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that Husain, as ambassador of a neighboring
Muslim country, is responsible for Saremi's security and his safe
return home.
</P>
<P>
However, the Pakistani press attache in reply read a press
release of the embassy that the government of Pakistan "can not be
held responsible for developments in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan has nothing whatsoever to do with the internal
developments in Afghanistan and Pakistan is not concerned with
the military successes or failures of any of the Afghan parties,"
the release said.
</P>
<P>
It said that Islamabad attaches utmost importance to the
security and safety of the Iranian citizens in Afghanistan and to
their treatment in accordance with the recognized norms and
principles of international behavior.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan would continue to extend all possible assistance to
the brotherly government of Iran, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted sources inside Afghanistan as saying that the
Iranians have been transferred to Qandahar, Taliban's headquarters
in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban forces claimed that they have not taken
any Iranians captive and that the Iranians have deserted their
Consulate in Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban forces arrived.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry has rejected Taliban's claim and
urged the United Nations and the International Committee of the
Red Cross to help release the Iranians held by Taliban.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Some sub-units of Russian and
Tajik troops were put on high alert Tuesday along the Tajik border
with Afghanistan amid reports that some Taliban fighters were
sighted near the border.
</P>
<P>
According to Valentin Orlov, commander of the 201st Russian
motorized division based in Tajikistan, the decision was made to
ensure security of the southern borders of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS), the Itar-Tass news reported in a
dispatch from Dushanbe, the Tajik capital.
</P>
<P>
The Russian troops were in Tajikistan as part of a collective
peacekeeping force of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Itar-Tass reported that some Taliban
detachments were spotted on the Afghan side of the border with
Tajikistan, opposite the Tajik village of Aivadzh and the first
post of the Russian Pyandzh border detachment.
</P>
<P>
Reserves from other border detachments were dispatched to
reinforce the section of the Pyandzh frontier, though no military
operations by the Taliban fighters were sighted.
</P>
<P>
Tajik President Emamoli Rakhmonov plans to discuss the
situation in Afghanistan later Tuesday afternoon with his
military advisors. Representatives from the command of the
Russian border troops and the CIS collective force are also
expected to attend the meeting, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
The recent flare-up of fighting in Northern Afghanistan has
worried Russia and the central republics bordering Afghanistan,
especially Tajikistan, which has the longest border with the
Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
In Uzbekistan, restrictions have been re-imposed on the
frontier garrison town of Termez and outsiders could not fly there
without special permission.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban fighters have reportedly captured the northern city
of Mazar-e-Sharif following their weekend offensive.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Says to Change Stance on U.S. Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has promised the U.S. a change in the Likud stance
towards the American proposal for a 13 percent Israeli pullback,
said a senior aide to the Egyptian president.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, the presidential political advisor, said Monday
night that Netanyahu's promise was made to U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright during a recent contact, the Middle East News
Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But the Egyptian official cautioned that the Israeli government
could "accept the U.S. proposal, reject it, or accept it without
genuinely implementing it."
</P>
<P>
"Israel believes that Palestinians have to take what the
Israeli government offers them, and this is a misconception," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. peace plan, calling on Israel to withdraw from 13.1
percent more of the West Bank, represents the "minimum level" of
Palestinian rights, he said. Nevertheless, Israel rejects it on
the basis of false claims that it wants to live in peace, he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to "shortcoming" of the Oslo agreement, which he
said lies in that it has deferred the thorny issues to the final
stage negotiations, namely, the issues of Jerusalem, settlements,
water and the borders of the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Senior direct talks between the Palestinian and Israeli sides
were resumed on July 19 after a lapse of months. The Israeli side
has been insisting on making changes in the U.S. initiative, which
was rejected by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel proposed to hand over 10 percent, and turn the other 3
percent into a "nature reserve" to limit Palestinian control. The
Palestinian side demanded Israel accept the U.S. initiative in its
totality.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, the Palestinian side said they will not continue
such direct talks with Israel because it has nothing to offer.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Reportedly Capture Afghan Opposition Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's Islamic Taliban
militia on Tuesday captured the key northeastern Afghan town of
Taloqan, a key base of ousted Kabul government strongman Ahmad
Masood, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The fall of Taloqan, capital of Afghanistan's Takhar province,
would be another setback for the beleaguered anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance. Masood, the former Afghan military chief, is the top gun
of the anti-Taliban alliance which groups forces of Masood,
Uzbek-ethnic warlord Rashid Dostum and Shiite Hezb-e-Wadhat.
</P>
<P>
However, further details are still awaited.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, the alliance denied a report that former
Afghan Prime Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar was killed in an attack
in the Takhar province.
</P>
<P>
"I strongly deny the report, I have just talked to my boss and
he is all right," Ghairat Baheer, Hekmatyar's son-in-law and
Islamabad-based representative of Hezb-e-Islami Afghanistan told
the official Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A foreign wire service quoted unnamed Taliban sources as saying
 three gunmen shot to death the Hezb-e-Islami chief in Takhar
amidst reports that Afghan government troops have routed Northern
Alliance forces in Taloqan.
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Hekmatyar is healthy and in high spirits," Baheer said.
But he declined to tell the whereabouts of his leader, saying
only, "He is inside Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
In their latest attempt to take over the alliance-controlled
northern Afghanistan, the purist Taliban militia overran
Mazar-e-Sharif, de facto capital of the opposition alliance last
weekend. Now the hard-line militia are marching on to the
northeastern provinces defended by forces loyal to Masood.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar fled to Iran after the Taliban ousted his government
in Kabul in 1996, but he returned to help lead a fractious
coalition of anti-Taliban factions. An ally said recently that he
was in Badakshan province in far-northeastern Afghanistan,
bordering Takhar province.
</P>
<P>
Ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani, leader of another
anti-Taliban faction, had fought a bitter power struggle with
Hekmatyar, leader of the southern-based Hezb-e-Islami, before they
became allies to oust the Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Badly Hit on Singapore Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Share Prices recorded a sharp
drop to a new low on Singapore Stock Market Tuesday as traders
fret over the fresh plunge in regional currencies led by the
Japanese yen and equity.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index (STII) lost 31.34
points to close at 1007.93 points as disappointment over the
continued weakness in regional currencies haunted the Singapore
Stock Market and rattled investors.
</P>
<P>
The STII once fell through the 1000-point support-level in the
day but it managed to claw up to end above the support level.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the collapse of the yen to a fresh eight-year low
against U.S. dollar dragged down other regional currencies as
regional stock market continued their rapid decent.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's government-announced outlook that the Singapore
economy will remain weak is expected to add another complicating
factor to the stock market
</P>
<P>
The total turnover was 136.15 million shares worth 232.03
million Singapore dollars (about 133.35 million U.S. dollars).
Losers outstripped gainers by 303 to 23 while 262 counters
remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
EnerSave remained the most active stock of the day with a
turnover of 8.02 million units. It was followed by DBS Land that
had 6.92 million stocks traded. TAC 200 was next with 5.96 million
counters changing hands.
</P>
<P>
Paramt was the top gainer of the day as it edged up six cents
to close at 0.24 Singapore dollars. CWT, Natelec, Prima, SingTel
and GeorKen inched up two cents respectively. Their prices at
close were 0.34 Singapore dollars for CWT, 3.34 Singapore dollars
for NatElec, 2.57 Singapore dollars for Prima, 2.64 Singapore
dollars for SingTel, and 0.155 Singapore dollars for GeorKen.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, MISC F was the biggest loser of the day as it
dropped by 1.28 Singapore dollars to close at 1.35 Singapore
dollars. Genting 200 slipped by 1.12 Singapore dollars to finish
at 2.90 Singapore dollars. SIA F ebbed by 70 cents to end at 7.55
Singapore dollars.

<HEADLINE> Germany Bank Eyes Takeover of Major U.S. Stock Broker House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Dresdner Bank, one of Germany's
biggest commercial banks, is planning to take over a major
U.S. stock broker house, Paine Webber Group Inc., in a bid to
expand its business presence in the United States, a German
business daily reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Informal negotiations between the two major financial
institutions had been proceeding for weeks in New York, a report
in the German business daily Handelsblatt quoted sources close to
the talks as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both Dresdner Bank and Paine Webber have declined to comment on
the possible takeover. The Handelsblatt, however, viewed the
latest talks as a concrete sign of Dresdner Bank's intention to
seek greater expansion in the U.S. market, which was indicated by
Dresdner chief executive Bernhard Walter several times over the
past weeks.
</P>
<P>
With about 2.5 million customers, the New York-based Paine
Webber is regarded as one of the biggest broker houses in the
United States. It is also active in investment banking, insurance
and capital market business.
</P>
<P>
The Handelsblatt estimated that to acquire a 100 percent stake
in Paine Webber, Dresdner Bank might had to pay about nine to 10
billion U.S. dollars, which would require the bank to dig deep
into its pocket.
</P>
<P>
Under current circumstances, it might be plausible for Dresdner
Bank to also involve its big shareholder, Germany's biggest
insurance company, Allianz, in the takeover bid, the newspaper
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Expert on Universal Declaration of Human Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The international community
should use the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the adoption of
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) to sum up the
experience gained and lessons learned in the field of human rights
in the second half of the 20th century, said a Chinese human
rights expert here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an ongoing meeting of a sub-commission of the
United Nations Human Rights Committee, Zhong Shukong said that it
is time for the whole world to equitably furthering the lofty
cause of human rights in all their dimensions in the 21st century
when the UDHR enters its 50th anniversary on December 10, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Born after the tragic catastrophe and unprecedented massive
violation of human rights brought about by the Second World War
unleashed by the fascists, the UDHR represents the ardent
aspirations of the people of the whole world to protect and
promote human rights," Zhong said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the basic contents of the declaration has been
enriched with the emergence of the 100 plus developing countries
which used to be colonies or semi-colonies.
</P>
<P>
To support his point of view, Zhong outlined two aspects
particularly worth noting.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, a number of declarations including the International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Declaration
on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, and the
Declaration on the Right to Development have been adopted to
address the right to development.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the lofty cause of human rights has been so
shockingly distorted by the Cold War and the "Cold War mentality"
that human rights issues have been turned into pretexts and even
"profitable business" for exerting political pressure, for
applying double-standards, and for interfering in the internal
affairs of other countries, particularly of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Zhong said, Issues of so-called political rights
of individuals have dominated the agenda, to the neglect, and even
negation, of economic, social and cultural rights, the right to
subsistence and the right to development.
</P>
<P>
"Facts have proved over and over again that peace and
development are the two top priorities of our contemporary world,"
he said, "And they will remain the two top priorities in the 21st
century."
</P>
<P>
Looking into the future, Zhong suggested that all members of
the United Nations should promote cooperation in good faith for
the realization of the right to development according to relevant
articles of the Charter of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"The sooner these and other related stipulations are translated
into deeds by all state members of the U.N., in a spirit of 'new
global partnership,' the better will our world be in the new
century," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Brokers Deal in Lesotho Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki has helped broker a deal between Lesotho
authorities and opposition parties after holding six-hour talks
with the two sides Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho government and opposition parties agreed to the
appointment of a regional committee to investigate opposition
allegations of electoral fraud, the South African media reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki, who was accompanied by Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo and
Defense Minister Joe Modise, said the agreement called for a team
of experts from South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe to probe
opposition allegations of wrong-doing in the May 23 election.
</P>
<P>
The team would have two weeks to report its findings.
</P>
<P>
Their report would be given to the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), the Organization of African Unity,
the Commonwealth and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Both Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili and the
opposition leaders had pledged to abide by the findings, said
Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister of Lesotho and concerned parties have
agreed to abide by the outcome of the investigation, and the
opposition alliance have agreed to address their followers on
that matter," Mbeki told reporters after talks.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Foreign Minister Tom Thabane also said all parties
would be bound by the outcome of the investigations by the
regional team.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister has pledged that if the elections are
proved to be fraudulent, his government will advise the king to
dissolve parliament," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the SADC chose South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe to
intervene in a political crisis in Lesotho. "that mandate has not
been withdrawn," said Thabane.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of opposition supporters had camped in front of King
Letsie III's palace since last Tuesday, demanding an overturn of
the electoral results.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) won 79 of 80
seats in parliament. But opposition parties claimed the election
was rigged in favor of the LCD.
</P>
<P>
At least one person was reportedly killed and two others were
shot and wounded in Maseru, capital of Lesotho, Monday as the
political impasse turned violent.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen other people were reportedly injured and admitted to
hospital.
</P>
<P>
A national strike called by opposition parties was successful
Monday in Maseru, where government offices and businesses stayed
closed. Those who defied the call had their vehicles taken away.
Tires were burned in the streets and roadblocks were set up.

three-month intervention rate again by another 50-basis points to
10.00 percent.

<P>
With a weaker ringgit which closed Tuesday at 4.2500/2600 to
the U.S. dollar against Monday's close at 4.2170/2370, the stock
market was left with little buying support in line with declining
corporate performance, they said.

<P>
On a sectoral basis, consumer products accounted for 5.873
million shares traded on the main board, industrial products 9.154
million shares, construction 8.519 million shares,
trading/services 40.363 million shares, infrastructure 844,000
shares, finance 22.446 million shares, hotels 478,000 shares,
properties 12.772 million shares, plantation 4.125 million shares,

<HEADLINE> El Nino's Opposite May Cause More Typhoons In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, Chao Jiping, says that La Nina could cause more
typhoons in China and affect economic activities in coastal area
and put pressure on flood-relief efforts in the Yangtze River
valley.
</P>
<P>
Chao told a meeting of academics that the La Nina phenomenon,
the opposite of El Nino, meaning colder-than-normal surface
temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, has arrived, and that
historical records show more typhoons during La Nina.
</P>
<P>
This year, La Nina took only one month to appear in the Pacific
Ocean, while last year's strong El Nino took eight months. Typhoon
activity has been quite unusual this year, with three appearing to
date. But there are an average of 28 typhoons every year, with as
many as 9 coming to China, experts say.
</P>
<P>
China may have frequent typhoons for the next several months,
Chao said, warning related departments to pay close attention to
the possible focal points and to be prepared.
</P>
<P>
China has 11 provinces and large cities that could be directly
threatened by typhoons, most of which are developed areas that are
densely populated.
</P>
<P>
China has a 5,700-km sea wall and coastal regions have spent
nearly one billion yuan this year on 1,700 km of sea wall,
building 600-some reservoirs, and some 450 water gates to deal
with typhoons.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed

The currency finished the local session in Sydney at 59.53 U.S.
cents from 59.68 U.S. cents previously.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar had touched two-month lows on the day,
trading between 59.40 U.S. cents and 59.85 U.S. cents.

<P>
The Japanese yen weakened against the U.S. dollar dramatically
late in the session as the U.S. dollar/Japanese yen exchange rate
trading to an eight-year record highs.
</P>

The Japanese currency was further undermined by a report from
the country's economic planning agency.

<P>
In its monthly report to Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
the agency said the country's slump in economic activity was
prolonged and the economy continued to be in an extremely severe

MACAO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Macao is to issue a new coin this
year, which will be put into use in the last quarter of 1998, the

</P>
<P>
A total of 3.50 million pieces of the new coins will be minted,
with a face value of two patacas (about 0.25 U.S. dollars). The
octagonal coin will have the sketch of a well-known temple and a

Portuguese languages on one side, and the picture of a bat
(implying "happiness" in Chinese tradition) and the word "Macao"
in Chinese and Portuguese on the other side.

The report said that the new coins will be put into
circulation in the last quarter of this year. It is the first time
the two-pataca coins put into circulation since 1991.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Needs $10B to Tackle Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will need 10 billion U.S.
Dollars to address the computer problem known as the Millennium
Bug, a senior government official has said.
</P>
<P>
Olu Bajowa, the permanent secretary to the Federal Ministry of
Science and Technology, made the disclosure Monday in Abuja while
briefing the media on a national workshop on the issue expected
to open Tuesday in the federal capital.
</P>
<P>
The cost will be for the upgrading and replacing of the
estimated 500,000 computer units now in use in Nigeria, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called Millennium Bug issue arises from the fact that
most of the computers now in use in the world recognize any given
year by the last two digits, so when the year 2000 comes, the
computer will reset its calendar to 1900, thus causing system
error that may entail huge losses on its user.
</P>
<P>
Bajowa urged the private sector to complement the effort of
government in averting the disaster which is now barely 17 months
away.
</P>
<P>
"The millennium bug problem is real and both the public and
private sectors should be well prepared to cope with the
consequences of the millennium calendar change-over," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bajowa urged the public to henceforth buy computers that are
year 2000-compliant.
</P>
<P>
He urged the public to resist the biggest threat of dumping
non-compliant computers by "unscrupulous importers."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong New Airport Opens up Tourism Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The July opening of the new
Hong Kong International Airport has made the adjacent North Lantau
Corridor an excellent location for the development of new tourism
attractions, according to the Hong Kong Tourism Association
(HKTA).
</P>
<P>
The HKTA has suggested developing five major tourism areas
along the north coast of Lantau Island, and the related study is
progressing well, Stanley Yip, HKTA's general manager for research
and development, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mass Transit Railway Corporation has been appointed by the
government to spearhead a cable car project linking the airport
with one of the world's biggest buddhas, the Giant Buddha at Ngong
Ping.
</P>
<P>
Other projects being explored for the North Lantau area
included film city and theme parks, aquatic center, heritage
attractions in Tung Chung new town and Tai O fishing village.
</P>
<P>
Yip was updating the media on the latest development of various
projects recommended in the HKTA-initiated Visitor and Tourism
Study for Hong Kong (VISTOUR), which was completed in late 1995.
The program provided a blueprint for medium- and long-term tourism
development so as to secure Hong Kong's role as Asia's premier
tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
On enhancement of existing tourist attractions, which was also
included in the program, Yip said that Central and Western
District on Hong Kong Island has been chosen as a pilot project.
</P>
<P>
"The overall objective is to strengthen and highlight the
district's unique and appealing character," said Yip, adding that
the enhancement plans, covering both marketing and physical
improvements, will be extended to other existing tourist
attractions across Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Yip told reporters that the HKTA will join hands with the
Agriculture and Fisheries Department in compiling the first
comprehensive Green Hong Kong Guide to provide the public and
visitors with information about the diverse ecology of Hong Kong
and its environmental resources.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the year 1998 will be a difficult year for the
tourism industry, with tourist arrivals absorbing the impact of
the regional financial crisis to shrink about 6 percent.

<P>
HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong stocks Tuesday
plunged to a five-year low amid concerns about the sliding
Japanese yen and disappointing mid-year corporate earnings
reports.
</P>
<P>
The key Hang Seng Index fell sharply by 254.67 points, or 3.62
percent, to end the day at 6,779.95, the lowest since July 22,
1993, when the market closed at 6,760.02 points.
</P>
<P>
Market sources said that the Japanese currency hit an
eight-year low Tuesday by breaking the level of 147 yen to one
U.S. dollar, putting pressure on stock markets in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong stock market was clouded by disappointment in poor
corporate earnings announced last week by blue-chip companies.
</P>
<P>
The 33-blue chip index dived below the 7,000-point
psychological barrier shortly after opening on Tuesday, wiping out
Monday's small rebound. The losing momentum continued in the
afternoon to push the market to the day's lowest of 6,725.59
points.
</P>
<P>
Turnover increased to 5.019 billion HK dollars (643 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sectoral stocks experienced an all-round retreat Tuesday.
Utility shares were hit hardest, slumping 420.87 points or 4.39
percent, while banking and property counters both fell about 3.8

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Open Affected by Economic Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 11(Xinhua)-- One of the world elite badminton
championships Indonesian Open fell victim to the country's
current economic crisis and is struggling to find its way.
</P>
<P>
The previous jackpot of 15,000 U.S. dollars has been cut by
20% to 12,000 dollars for the lack of sponsorship and the
tournament's five-star status is at stake.
</P>
<P>
Hit by the country's worst financial crisis in decades, the
Indonesian Open came on the verge of being canceled out this year
since the Badminton Association of Indonesia (PBSI) didn't have
enough money.
</P>
<P>
PBSI has decided to fish out a total of 500 million rupiah
(about 40,000 U.S. dollars) from its own pocket to cover the
operation expenses while the bonus will be from sponsors.
</P>
<P>
The tournament, held in July every year, was therefore
postponed to from October 25 to November 1.
</P>
<P>
PBST has sent invitations to over 30 Badminton Associations in
the world and only Britain failed to answer because the schedule
collides with the Commonwealth Games which is to be held in Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia.

<HEADLINE> hke081152 -Bangladesh's Cereal Production Projected at 18.9m Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The net cereal production in the
current fiscal year (July 1998-June 1999) has been projected at
18.9 million tons, The Financial Express daily reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The total cereal production in the fiscal year has been
projected at 21 million tons, and after deducting 10 percent of
the production as seed, feed and waste, the net production would
stand around 18.9 million tons, the report quoted an Agriculture
Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Cereal demand in the country with a population of 127 million
for the fiscal year has been estimated at 21.02 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Considering the net production, foodgrain deficit would stand
at round 2.12 million tons, and this deficit would have to be met
through imports or procurements from external sources, he stated.
</P>
<P>
This was a primary food budget situation which would undergo
review from time to time, he added.
</P>
<P>
He, however, warned that the cereal production projection was
subject to climatic behavior.
</P>
<P>
The gross cereal production of Bangladesh stood at 20.3 million
and 20.5 million tons of cereal in the last two fiscal years
respectively, due to the successes of agricultural policies
pursued by the government, according to the annual budget report
presented in the parliament by finance minister on June 11, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Somali Town Calm Following Clergymen's Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The situation was calm, but
tense Tuesday morning after a well-known Islamic clergyman was
shot dead Monday afternoon in the central Somali town of
Beletuein, 300 km north of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
Many people grieved for the death of the clergyman, Sheikh
Abdurahman Sayid Sheikh Hassan, who was well known for his
justice when handling civil cases in the Islamic court.
</P>
<P>
According to an eyewitness in the town, Sheikh Hassan was shot
dead by unidentified gunmen near the school of Ahmed Warsame.
</P>
<P>
The eyewitness also said that Sheikh Hassan, one of the main
advocates and lawyers of the Islamic court of Beletuein, was
killed along with one of his bodyguards on his way home from his
office.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the killing is not known. However, an
investigation made by leading figures of the court indicated that
the killings were carried out by militiamen from the Hawadle clan
dominating the eastern side of Beletuein.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the clansmen of the deceased clergyman said
the killings are most likely related to an earlier clan rivalry
between the Hawadle clansmen and those of late Sheikh Hassan.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, two clansmen earlier fought over land ownership over
Abaley village near the border with Ethiopia where several people
were killed and more than 200 heads of cattle were looted.
</P>
<P>
Sources from Beletuein said the killings followed the deadlock
of peace talks between the two sides in the town where serious
argument broke out over the value of the looted cattle and the
compensation of the dead during the clashes between the two sides
some three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the armed skirmishes began between the two sides,
the security of the late clergyman was overseen by Hawadle
militiamen since the Rer Aw-Hassan people are less armed in the
town.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Hits Eight-Year High in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar surpassed this
year's high of 146.75 yen, hitting an eight-year high of 147.64
yen in Tokyo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 147.40-42 yen at 5 p.m. (local time),
up from 146.46-48 yen at 9 a.m. in Tokyo, and from 146.25-35 yen
late Monday in New York.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency sagged to 146.00 yen during the day, with
most deals centering on 146.90 yen. Just before 3 p.m., it surged
above 147 yen to the level last seen in Tokyo in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Market players aggressively pushed the dollar above the 147 yen
line after seeing the key Nikkei index of Tokyo stock prices sag
to levels last logged in June.
</P>
<P>
The key Nikkei average fell for the seventh straight session
Tuesday, ending 219.43 points lower at 15,406.99, with banking
issues being hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
"The continued selling of bank shares is really hurting the
yen," a trader said.
</P>
<P>
Market players saw little reason to hold on to the yen with yet
another dismal report on the economy released during the day.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Economic Planning Agency (EPA) on Tuesday termed the
Japanese economy as "slumping" in its August report, breaking from
the description of "stagnant" it used in previous monthly reports.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the dollar's sharp rise, Japanese top government
Hiromu Nonaka said that the Japanese government is "strongly
concerned" about the yen's sharp decline.
</P>
<P>
"I think the excessive weakness of the yen is unfavorable for
the Japanese economy and for the Asian and world economies,"
Nonaka told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would "carefully watch the development
of the exchange rate and cope with it appropriately at the right
time."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Host Seminar on Water Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is scheduled to hold an
international seminar on water next month in a bid to set an
agenda for water resources management in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The seminar scheduled for September 16 will incorporate
discussions on Nigerian inland water ways with a view to offering
thorough understanding of their unique place in the overall water
resources master plan for the country.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, according to press reports here, will discuss
harrowing water shortages, the health implications for developing
nations, commercialization of water supply.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition of "Water '98" will be held when the seminar
takes place in this west African country.
</P>
<P>
Experts in water resources management from home and abroad are
expected to present papers while water engineering firms,
manufacturers and stockists of water equipment and facilities are
also expected to feature in the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is sponsored by a non-governmental organization of
Century 21 System Ltd. based in Lagos in cooperation with
Construction Digest Journal.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, which is a follow-up to last month's
international conference on water and sustainable development
held in Nigeria, is to be held amidst reports of mounting
scarcity of the water resources throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Findings show that although water covers about 70 percent of
the surface of the earth, 98 percent of it has been found to be
salty while 60 percent of the remaining fresh water is
concentrated in a few countries, thus making the scarcity of
water supply a problem in most countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Firm Wins Australian Defense Radar Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- American aerospace company
Lockheed Martin has won contracts worth 125 million Australian
dollars (75 million U.S. dollars) for four new air defense radar
systems for the Australian Defense Force (ADF), or the nation's
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said Tuesday the new
radars would replace the older systems operated by the Australian
air force at Williamtown in the state of New South Wales, and the
port city of Darwin, capital of the Northern Territory in northern
Australia.
</P>
<P>
He said Lockheed Martin teamed up with Australian company Tenix
Defense Systems and RLM Systems, a joint venture between Lockheed
and Tenix, to offer the new TPS-117 tactically mobile long range
air defense radar systems.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Lockheed will supply the radars and support
them for an initial five-year period.
</P>
<P>
"The new radar systems will contribute to the overall
surveillance and control of Australian air space," McLachlan said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"The enhanced performance of the TPS-117 radars will provide
improved detection of aircraft even in adverse weather conditions.
They can relocated by air, rail, sea or road, including tactical
cross-country deployments by all wheel drive vehicles," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new radars will be assembled at Tenix in Melbourne using
some Australian-made sub-systems.
</P>
<P>
McLachlan said the first radar was expected to be delivered to
the Australian armed forces for evaluation by December 2000.

<HEADLINE> New Microelectronics Research Program Launched in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
launched a new research program targeting most challenging
technological problems the semiconductor industry faces in the
future.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) announced
Monday that the Focus Center Research Program, jointly created by
the U.S. semiconductor industry and the federal government, is
negotiating with university consortia over multimillion-dollar
research and development contracts that will study new
methodologies in designing, testing and connecting microchip
components.
</P>
<P>
The university consortia are led by University of California at
Berkeley and Georgia Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the first two centers in UC-Berkeley and the
Georgia institute, SIA said, the industry plans to establish four
new focus centers nationwide, which will lead the research efforts
of a multi-university network.
</P>
<P>
The program is the most ambitious research project the U.S.
semiconductor industry has undertaken since 1987, when it formed
SEMATECH, a consortium of U.S. chip manufacturers created to
establish U.S. leadership in manufacturing and process technology,
SIA said.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the focus centers and participating universities will
provide salaries for students and faculty, along with equipment
and upgraded facilities, SIA said.
</P>
<P>
The six centers will eventually receive 60 million U.S. dollars
a year. Funding for the future awards will come from SIA,
SEMI/SEMATECH and the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The driving force in the semiconductor industry has been the
theorem known as Moore's Law. First posited by Intel co-founder
Gordon Moore in the 1960s, Moore's Law states that the number of
transistors that fit on a chip will double every 18 months. Chips
run not only computers, but also all sorts of devices, ranging
from cars to clocks.
</P>
<P>
Moore's Law has held true so far, with Intel's Pentium cramming
eight million transistors on a tiny silver of silicon. The
industry is confident that it can do even better, such as fixing
100 million transistors on a chip. But to make it, more research
is needed, into the way chips are designed, the materials that are
used to make them and the way the finished chips are tested.

<HEADLINE> WHO Calls for Fight Against Child Killer Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Director-General of the World
Health Organization (WHO) Gro Harlem Brundtland has called on
paediatricians worldwide to do their best to reduce the deaths of
children under age five.
</P>
<P>
In her first major policy address since taking office on July
21, the WHO chief said that paediatricians have a special role to
play in developing health systems and health care so as to nurture
and protect humanity's future.
</P>
<P>
"Paediatricians are more than just doctors prescribing
treatments," Brundtland said Tuesday in addressing the 22nd
International Congress of Paediatrics in Amsterdam, the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
"you are the people we turn to and trust for advice on the
healthy growth and development of our children," she said. "This
trust makes you a very special kind of community leader. You are a
powerful voice for children who have very little voice in far too
many countries."
</P>
<P>
Acute respiratory infection, diarrhoea, measles, malaria and
malnutrition kill about 70 percent of the 11 million children who
die annually worldwide before reaching their fifth birthday,
according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
The poor are five times more likely to die before the age of
five and, in some African countries, one child in five still dies
before reaching age five, while 75 per 1,000 live-born children
die before reaching one month of age.
</P>
<P>
In the developing world, one-sixth of all children are born
underweight, and, globally, malnutrition underlies more than 50
percent of all childhood deaths.
</P>
<P>
Brundtland stressed that breastfeeding is critically important
in preventing both malnutrition and susceptibility to contracting
infectious diseases, and warned of aggressive marketing of
breast-milk substitutes that undermine breastfeeding.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing's Ethnic Groups Rising Out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Residents of the Qianjiang
Development Zone of southwest China's Chongqing Municipality are
expected to meet the state's poverty-eradication standards and be
fully lifted out of poverty in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The state poverty-eradication standards for rural areas in
China set the per capita grain availability at 400 kilograms and
per capita income at 500 yuan (based on the constant price
of 1990).
</P>
<P>
Local sources said that the per capita grain availability in
the Qianjiang Development Zone is about 600 kilograms, exceeding
the state standard.
</P>
<P>
Qianjiang is situated deep in the Wuling Mountains. It has a
population of 2.84 million, 73.5 percent of whom are ethnic
minority people such as Tujia and Miao people.
</P>
<P>
The region abounds in natural resources, but has been slow in
economic development because of backward infrastructure in such
areas as transportation. Ten years ago, 80 percent of the
development zone's people were living below the state poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the Qianjiang Development Zone, with five
counties, generated a gross domestic product (GDP) of 6.1 billion
yuan in 1997, up 207.9 percent over 1988 when Qianjiang become a
prefecture, or an annual average growth rate of 12.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The per capita grain share and per capita income of local
residents were 599 kilograms and 1,200 yuan in 1997, respectively,
both showing marked increases. And the impoverished population was
reduced to 650,000 in 1997 from 1.9 million in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure has been greatly improved in the development
zone, with a national highway running through the region, an
adequate power supply, and operation of a computer-controlled
telephone service and mobile phone service. The Qianjiang
Development Zone will be connected with the unified Chongqing
Municipal Telecommunications Network in October.
</P>
<P>
Local officials pledged to work harder to expand five major
industries: tobacco, animal husbandry, forestry, tourism and
mining.

<HEADLINE> Australian Tourism Hard Hit by Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Australia's tourism industry
was hard hit by the ongoing Asian financial crisis and the rise of
Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party with visitors from some Asian
countries falling significantly.
</P>
<P>
International arrivals had dipped slightly for the first time
this decade, and most of the loss was from Asia, Australia's
largest market, the Australian Associated Press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Asian visitors dropped almost 9 percent to 1.18 million in the
year to April, while numbers from the Americas and Europe grew by
around 10 percent offsetting to some extent the falls in the
number of visitors from Asia.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures, for May, show that the number of Asian
visitors went down by 23 percent from the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
Asian countries or regions most affected in the year to April
were Thailand (down 41 percent) to 51,000; South Korea (down 34
percent to 159,000); Indonesia (down 18 percent to 131,000) and
Hong Kong (down 8 percent to 143,000).
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors from Japan, one of Australia's leading
sources of tourists, was down almost 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Singapore, one of the biggest single sources of tourists from
Asia, provided brighter news with a 12 percent increase to
250,000.
</P>
<P>
Tourism bodies credited the increase in the number of visitors
from the Americas and Europe to the devalued Australian dollar, as
the exchange rate made Australia more attractive to travelers from
the United States, Britain and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The tourism industry contributes 9.6 billion U.S. dollars to
Australia's economy.
</P>
<P>
John Schaap, chairman of Tourism Council of Australia, said it
was "undoubtedly" true that the Australian image abroad had been
changed by negative perceptions about what One Nation Party
represented.

PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
 in leading French newspapers on Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The heat wave which has been ruling France for three days
triggered on Monday the alarms of pollution at level 2 in about 15
big cities. Overwhelmed by the great hotness, the inhabitants of
cities were subjected to the ozone pollution the most.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States has resorted to an old Far West way to seek
criminals by offering a 2 million dollar reward for providing
information on the double attack on the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania. This also gave a sign of the difficulty in investigating
the attack.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The tone is rising between Teheran and Kabul as the Taliban
force Monday took total control of the opposition stronghold
Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan, after a series of fighting
in the last pockets of resistance by the forces of Massud. The
commander of the Republican Guard, General Rahim Yahya Safavi, has
threatened to counter-attack any aggression and "attempt of
insecurity" on the Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
-- The house rents have risen in Paris by 2.5 percent and in the
Paris region by 8.9 percent over the past seven months this year,
which was the first rise of rents after years of uninterrupted
dropping of the rents. The rents for studios have risen the most in
Paris.

Financial Times:

would not allow the British Airways-American Airlines alliance to
sell take-off and landing slots at London airports.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- A big increase in the price of a drug given routinely to
prevent women haemorrhaging after they give birth could cost the
National Health Service nearly 1 million pounds and has raised the
spectre of more maternal deaths if health authorities start to
ration its use.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall for 7th Straight Day in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell for the seventh
consecutive day in Tokyo Tuesday as financial shares were heavily
sold off, triggered by the yen's slide and a fall in Asian stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange tumbled 219.43 points, or 1.40
percent, from Monday's close to end at 15,406.99, the lowest in
seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, lost 20.21 points or 1.67 percent to
1,186.88.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went sharply up to an estimated
460 million shares up from 363.88 million shares Monday.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan was the day's most heavily
traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Shares encountered mild losses in the morning as investors
bought back shares when the key 225-issue Nikkei sank to near
15,500.
</P>
<P>
While many had seen 15,500 as a psychological support line,
that mind-set vanished in the afternoon when Hong Kong's benchmark
Hang Seng stock index dipped below 7,000.
</P>
<P>
Firms with a big presence in Asia dropped fast as the Nikkei
slid as low as 15,310.59, below the seven-week closing low of
15,365.73 recorded on June 29.
</P>
<P>
All but one of Japan's top 19 banks ended lower as traders
acknowledged the strong fears gripping investors over the
industry's ongoing struggle with problem loans.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,335 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outnumbered gainers 952 to 189, with 131 issues remaining
unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Cautions Media Over Offensive Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba has advised media organizations to desist from importing
offensive programs that compromise morals of the youths.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba made the remarks when he launched Trinity Broadcasting
Network (TBN), the first Christian television in the country, in
Lusaka on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Such programs are an affront to Zambian values and
Christianity, he was quoted by Tuesday's Times of Zambia as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that society, especially the young should not be
exposed to inappropriate messages under the guise of modernity.
</P>
<P>
"A free service should not be synonymous with decadence. With
modern television technology, offensive messages can be
sanitized, all that is required is hard work and an appropriate
understanding of societal values," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba added that the nations's fiber and fabric will weaken
and that the Christian society being built in Zambia will end up
crumbling if children get confused and contaminated with bad
pictures and messages.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba urged the Christian community to work together and
fight those who are trying to spoil what the nation is building,
which he described as a "friendly but serious" warning against
those who import wholesale programs that are an affront to
Zambian values.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, all television programs on Zambia Television
Station are being supplied from the United States, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian leader also said the launch of TBN Zambia is a
symbol of the success of his government which promised to open
the media, including the air waves to private participants.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Shares Plunge By 3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Stockholm's OMX index of the
largest publically traded stocks plunged by 3 percent on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The share prices have fallen partly because of fears that the
Asian recession will hurt business corporations more than
previously expected.
</P>
<P>
Developments in Stockholm are extremely similar to the pattern
of share fluctuations exactly one year ago, when Asian economic
tremors first started to shake European markets. In 1997, as in
1998, share prices climbed steadily during the first eight months.
</P>
<P>
Since Stockholm reached its all-time-high three weeks ago, the
Swedish exchange has fallen by over 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
One of the big losers was Ericsson, the world's third largest
maker of mobile telephone. Ericsson has lost 19.7 percent of its
value since it said on July 27 that phone sales stagnated in the
second quarter.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Reaffirms Three Options for Forming Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen, whose Cambodian People's Party (CPP) has won the
multi-party election, said Tuesday that his party has three
alternatives to form a new government and get out of the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the remarks when meeting the ambassadors of
Myanmar and Laos separatively.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said he hoped Prince Norodom Ranariddh's FUNCINPEC
party could cooperate again with the CPP in forming a new
coalition government, according to Prak Sokhon, Hun Sen's foreign
affairs adviser.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the Sam Rainsy Party (SRP) can be in opposition as
its leader "Sam Rainsy was trained to be in opposition."
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution, a coalition has to be formed if no
party wins the required two-thirds majority, with the largest
party naming the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
In the July 26 election, the CPP won 41.4 percent of the total
votes, followed by FUNCINPEC with 31.7 percent and SRP with 14
percent.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen believed that the CPP and FUNCINPEC can form a
coalition and share power, with the CPP taking 60 percent and
FUNCINPEC 40 percent of the cabinet posts. Hun Sen also said
FUNCINPEC was considering the plan, although FUNCINPEC was not
happy with the outcome of the election.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh has earlier ruled out the possibility of joining a
coalition with Hun Sen. He said he himself would never work as
deputy premier or whatsoever in a government led by Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
Sokhon quoted Hun Sen as saying that if Ranariddh rejected his
proposal, the two opposition parties must agree to amend the
Constitution to allow the CPP to form a government alone with a
simple majority.
</P>
<P>
"If the impasse continues," Hun Sen said, "I will not dissolve
the present government. The government will continue without a new
Assembly until the new government is established."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen predicted there would be some difficulties to implement
the third option, but it would be better than a nation without a
government.

<HEADLINE> More than 3,200 Palestinians Jailed in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli prisons are "home" to
more than 3,000 Palestinians who have been tried and found guilty
of security offenses, the Israeli Ha'aretz daily reported on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This figure does not include administrative detainees and
Palestinians jailed in facilities run by the Israeli Defense
Forces, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accuse Israel of sending large number of their
compatriots to prison without a trial. But the figure in this
regard is not available.
</P>
<P>
Of the 3,228 Palestinian prisoners on the record, 1,400 are
sentenced to life imprisonment and the others are serving terms
ranging from seven to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Following last week's reports that Israel is considering
freeing 100 Palestinians as a gesture to the Palestinian National
Authority, families of prisoners called for immediate release of
200 sick prisoners, regardless of the outcome of the peace talks
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Some of the prisoners on the list have been imprisoned in
Israel for about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
But Israel seems backtracking on the idea. Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has said that prisoner release depends
on the PNA's crackdown on terrorism.

BELGRADE, August 10 (Xinhua) -- China is opposed to any
military actions or threat to use force against Yugoslavia in
dealing with the Kosovo crisis, a senior Chinese parliament
official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic here,
Peng Peiyun, a vice chairwoman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, said that the Kosovo issue was an internal
affair of Yugoslavia and Yugoslavia's sovereignty and territorial
integrity should be respected.
</P>
<P>
China backs the conflicting parties to solve the Kosovo issue
through political dialogue and does not support independence of
Kosovo from Yugoslavia, she said.
</P>
<P>
The measures the international community, including the United
Nations, takes on the Kosovo issue should be conducive to
stability in the region, she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that China opposes any foreign country taking military
actions against Yugoslavia or threatening to use force against it.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic said Yugoslavia appreciates the valuable support
China has extended to it at a time when some countries have been
trying to impose something on Yugoslavia in the name of democracy.
</P>
<P>
Peng and Milosevic also discussed relations between China and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
They expressed satisfaction over the development of the
bilateral relations in recent years, especially after the signing
of a statement on friendship and cooperation between the two
countries during Milosevic's visit to China last year.
</P>
<P>
Peng said that the Chinese people appreciate Yugoslavia's
support on the issues of Taiwan, human rights and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Milomir Minic, chairman of the Citizens Chamber of Federal
Assembly and Zivarad Jovanovic, Yugoslav foreign minister, also
met Peng on Monday.

<P>
SHENZHEN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- "The Shenzhen Special Economic
Zone has a great potential," said Zhong Xiaojian, a local resident
who started from scratch here. "It will take five years to turn
this dynamic area into another Singapore."
</P>
<P>
Zhong, chairman of the Xincheng Investment Co., started a
securities and investment company in Shenzhen six years ago which
he says achieved a great success.
</P>
<P>
"I love the city because it provides me a golden opportunity
for pioneering a great cause," he said. "A more important reason
is that the city has strong capability in self-development."
</P>
<P>
As a local resident, Zhong appreciates the government's
management of urban engineering, communications, public health and
the environment.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his satisfaction with the quality of
government departments. "The ability, efficiency and quality of
civil servants here are excellent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yu Liang, deputy general manager of Wanke Company, the first
listed real estate firm in China, said he admires the
fair-competition system in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
Yu came to Shenzhen after graduating from Beijing
University. In just four years Yu turned from a staff member to a
high-ranking official of the company.
</P>
<P>
"This is Shenzhen; so long as you are capable and diligent,
there are always a lot of changes for you," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Min, director of the general office of the Shenzhen
People's Congress, left Beijing for Shenzhen in 1987 when the city
was still a vast construction site.
</P>
<P>
In his view, Shenzhen is a constructive and creative city. The
pioneering spirit of Shenzhen residents makes the city the cradle
of new things.
</P>
<P>
None of my friends moving to Shenzhen has expressed regret over
their decisions, Wang said.

<HEADLINE> China's First Mobile Toilets In Northern City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Some mobile toilets on tricycles
can now be found in the city of Taiyuan, the capital of north
China's Shanxi Province, where they have proven popular,
especially in crowded places like the railway station or public
squares.
</P>
<P>
Their designer, Xue Mingyuan, said that the toilets are
convenient for pedestrians and the floating population of migrant
workers, who have difficulty finding a toilet in large cities.
</P>
<P>
The toilets cost approximately 7,000 yuan (850 U.S. dollars)
each, while a traditional free-standing toilet costs at least
100,000 yuan (12,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
In fact, Taiyuan already came up with the idea of a mobile
toilet several years ago, but they were built on motor vehicles
and proved unpopular because they were large and took up too much
space.
</P>
<P>
So, earlier this year, Xue, who is a former peasant farmer from
Wanrong County, got the idea about the need and designed a toilet
loaded on a tricycle to replace the larger ungainly ones. He set
up a company to provide the service and most of his employees, who
peddle the tricycles around town, are often people who were laid
off their jobs at state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Ready to Intervene in Congo Conflict: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will be ready
to intervene in the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) if called up to do so, President Nelson Mandela's spokesman
Parks Mankahlana has said.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said Mandela, who was resting in Maputo,
Mozambique, had been fully informed about the situation in the
DRC where government troops had been engaged in fighting with
rebel forces, Sowetan newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mankahlana said the setting up of a task team by southern
African leaders during a regional summit at Victoria Falls,
Zimbabwe over the weekend did not mean South Africa would not
continue with bilateral interaction with DRC President Laurent
Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks against a background that
southern African leaders, led by Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, seemed to have snubbed South Africa by excluding it in
efforts directed at addressing the DRC and Angolan conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"The Victoria Falls meeting was no snub to us," the spokesman
said, adding: "it was their initiative and we fully support and
respect it."
</P>
<P>
It was reported Monday that mediators from the Organization of
African Unity had arrived in Kinshasa to seek a peaceful
settlement to the week-old rebellion in the DRC, which was
previously called Zaire.

<HEADLINE> Busy Day At Southern Chinese Border Checkpoint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The day at the border checkpoint
at Gongbei between Macao and the city of Zhuhai, Guangdong
Province, begins at 6 o'clock in the morning, with about 100
trucks loaded with poultry, vegetables, and fruit waiting outside.
</P>
<P>
Gongbei is China's second largest border crossing, after
Shenzhen, next to Hong Kong, and handles more than 60,000
travelers and 7,000 trucks every day.
</P>
<P>
Fresh foods that Macao needs are supplied mainly from the
mainland, and in order to see that Macao residents get their food
while fresh, the checkpoint has simplied procedures and gives
priority to those goods.
</P>
<P>
Liang Huixiong, of the Zhuhai Food Import and Export Company,
says he goes with 3 or 4 trucks of fish to Macao every day,
arriving at the market in Macao by 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
Gongbei handles 16,000 tons of import goods and 80,000 tons
of exports every month. In recent years, the proportion of
exported goods has increased, according to He Shouhuang, who has
worked here for decades.
</P>
<P>
Raw materials like cloth and fur, and electronics spare parts
go to the Pearl River Delta from Macao, and finished products are
transported to Macao and abroad. Gongbei handles more than 60
million U.S. dollars worth of processed and trade goods every
month.
</P>
<P>
Because of the increase in the number of people passing through
Gongbei since the 1980s, the checkpoint has had to shorten the
amount of time it takes from half an hour to just several minutes.
</P>
<P>
Some Macao residents have bought houses in Zhuhai because of
the lower price and cross Gongbei customs going to work in Macao
every day. At least 3,000 Macao people who live in Zhuhai pass
through Gongbei every day.

<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Commonwealth ministers are
expected to meet in London in October to discuss the best
approach to take on Nigeria, following recent development in this
west African country.
</P>
<P>
A Nigerian delegation is likely to be invited to the London
talks by the eight-nation Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group
(CMAG), the Daily Times reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
CMAG, set up three years ago to monitor human rights situation
in member states including Nigeria, last month welcomed the plan
of Nigeria's new head of state General Abdulsalam Abubakar to
restore civil rule by May 29 next year and the release of some
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The London talks, originally set for July, has been
rescheduled for October 8 and 9, the newspaper said, quoting
diplomatic sources.
</P>
<P>
"Waiting until October makes sense because it gives us more
time to see if General Abubakar will live up to his promises," a
Commonwealth diplomat was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended from the grouping of mainly former
British colonies in 1995 after it executed nine minority human
rights activists.
</P>
<P>
CMAG comprises Britain, Canada, New Zealand, Botswana,
Barbados, Malaysia, Zimbabwe and Ghana.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Shuts Down Four Insurance Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, August 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korea announced on Tuesday
the closure of four ailing insurance companies as a first step to
clean up the insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
The four companies -- Kukjie, Taeyang, BYC and Coryo -- will
suspend their operation for three months in preparation for being
merged with other well-managing insurance firms, said the
Financial Supervisory Commission Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The liquidation of the four life insurance companies is
inevitable as they have been in dire financial crunch, with their
payable ratio, the minimum capital insurance should have, falling
below negative 30 percent, and their restructuring plans short of
feasibility, said the commission.
</P>
<P>
Samsung, Hungkuk, Kyobo and First Life will respectively take
over Kukje, BYC, Taeyang and Coryo.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the four companies will bring no harm to the
insured as their business will be taken over by the four stronger
ones. But some 2,100 employees of the four are expected to lose
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
In charge of restructuring tasks in economic field, the
Financial Supervisory Commission, which evaluated 18 ailing life
insurance companies and four non-life insurance firms, has decided
against an immediate liquidation of two out of the four non-life
insurance companies to reduce financial shock and burden.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the commission ordered seven other insurance
companies -- Dong-Ah, Doowon, Han Duk, Hankuk, Josun, Kookmin,
Pacific -- to show detailed and realistic plans to improve their
financial operation as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The commission, which has shut down 14 merchant banks and five
commercial banks since the nation started suffering a financial
crisis late last year, is expected to restructure security houses,
leasing firms and other non-banking institutions.

MANILA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine National Police chief
Roberto Lastimoso ordered Tuesday his men to beef up security
contingents within the premises of the U.S. Embassy in Manila,
following requests from American diplomats to avert any terrorist
attacks against them.

Police sources here said that Lastimoso's action came after
terrorists, who bombed U.S. embassies in Kenyan and Tanzanian
capitals three days ago, threatened to continue similar strikes at
American targets around the world.

Lastimoso said that more uniformed policemen, motorcycle
patrols, and secret agents will help secure the vicinity of the
U.S. embassy premises in Manila around the clock.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Growth Slows in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial sector grew
by 7.6 percent in July, 0.3 percent lower than in June, according
to the State Statistics Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
During July, the industrial sector's added value was 155.3
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In the January-July period, the incremental added value of the
sector reached 1.1 trillion yuan, up 7.8 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau attributed the slowdown in growth to widespread
flooding, which forced some factories to close. The Asian
financial crisis also is believed to have affected the country's
exports of manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
By the beginning of August, floods on the Yangtze, Yellow and
Nenjiang rivers had affected 240 million people in 28 provinces
across the country.
</P>
<P>
In July, state-owned firms grew more rapidly than in June,
while the collectively owned and foreign-funded ones grew at a
slower pace.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in July the state-owned firms registered a
5.1 percent of growth rate, 2.4 percent higher than in June.

WELLINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government is
to begin consultations on a proposal to improve consumer
confidence in the safety of food through the establishment of a
single food safety agency.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here Tuesday, N.Z. Agriculture Minister
Lockwood Smith and Associate Health Minister Tuariki John Delamere
said that currently, responsibility for food safety is spread
around different parts of the government.
</P>
<P>
"Business finds it difficult and expensive to implement food
safety programs because of the overlap in responsibilities," they
said in the statement, adding that the overlap also creates
confusion over who's accountable.
</P>
<P>
The two officials noted that there should be one agency that
would be based in the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and
tasked with "protecting public health, better integrating food
administration and regulation, and improving the facilitation of
access to international markets for food products."

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's resident
population was estimated at 3,792,200 on June 30 this year,
according to a media release issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This represented an increase of 31,100 or 0.8 percent over the
figure on June 30 1997, and this growth rate was slower than the
average annual growth rate of 1.4 percent for the previous five
years, Deputy Government Statistician Dianne Macaskill said in the
release.
</P>
<P>
A substantial drop in net immigration was the principal element
 in this smaller population increase. Net permanent and long-term
immigration (excess of arrivals over departures) for the year
ending June 1998 was 500, compared with 16,800 for the previous
year. Over the same period there was a small rise in natural
increase (excess of births over deaths), from 30,200 to 30,600,
the release said.
</P>
<P>
According to the release, the average age of New Zealand
residents at June 30 this year was 35.2 years, up from 34.9 years
a year ago. The population aged 65 years and over made up 11.7
percent of all New Zealand residents, compared with 11.6 percent
in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks to Be Approved for RMB Business in Shenzhen (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
announced here today that it has authorized the Shenzhen Special
Economic Zone as the second city, following Shanghai, to
experiment with business by foreign banks in renminbi (RMB),
China's currency.
</P>
<P>
More foreign banks also will be licensed for RMB business in
the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, where nine banks have already
been approved for experimental RMB business, said Liu Mingkang,
the bank's deputy governor, at a news conference this morning.
</P>
<P>
"Granting more foreign banks access to RMB business is
necessary for the economic and financial development of China and
also signals the strong commitment of the Chinese government to
further opening up the nation's financial industry to the outside
world," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that foreign financial institutions
had opened 178 operational establishments in China by June,
including 146 bank branches and 13 locally registered banks (six
solely foreign-owned and seven joint-venture banks).
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, total assets of foreign banks amounted to
37.39 billion U.S. dollars, accounting for 2.58 percent of the
total financial assets and 16.4 percent of the foreign exchange
assets of all the domestic financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Since China first authorized Pudong to be the first site for
experimental RMB business by foreign banks in March of 1997, nine
foreign banks have been granted access to such business. By June,
the nine branches reported 1.16 billion yuan in RMB assets, with
the total outstanding deposits and loans standing at 603 million
yuan and 763 million yuan, respectively.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia Giving Economy Help Through Road Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Government officials of north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region say they will increase
spending on road construction in 1998 by 500 million yuan (60.2
million US dollars) over 1997, bringing the total to 1.9 billion
yuan (230 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
This will speed up work on 14 construction projects and help
start another 16 over the next five months. The increased
infrastructure spending will add 273 million yuan (33 million US
dollars) to the region's GDP this year, the region's Vice-Chairman
Shen Shuji said. This will bring the region's total roads to 9,000
km by the end of this year, and is expected to add another 7,000
km in the next 5 years.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region had a GDP of 39 billion yuan (4.7 billion
US dollars) in the first half of the year, up 5.9 percent from the
same period of last year, but this was a drop of 2.4 percentage
points in growth.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee better results in investment in fixed assets, the
local government has decided to shift development emphasis from
coal and power industries to more promising industries like
transportation, housing, infrastructure and animal by-product
processing.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, the local government will allocate 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) for highway projects, Shen
said.

<P>
Hailing the experiment in Pudong as a great success, Liu said,
"allowing foreign banks to be engaged in RMB business has provided
the banks a new opportunity to explore market potential and
promote business development, the practice has also facilitated
the development of domestic financial institutions."
</P>
<P>
Liu also explained that there are good reasons for the central
bank to choose Shenzhen as the second experimental site of RMB
business by foreign banks, since Shenzhen is a financially open
city and the local branch of the People's Bank of China has gained
experience in supervising and regulating foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
There are 25 foreign bank branches in Shenzhen at present.
</P>
<P>
Regulations governing the experimental RMB business by foreign
banks in Pudong and Shenzhen will also be improved, according to
Liu.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, foreign banks with an RMB business license
may apply for a maximum RMB working capital of 100 million yuan.
The foreign banks with RMB business licenses used to be required
to have at least 30 million yuan in RMB working capital.
</P>
<P>
Other revisions will include an ease of control on interbank
borrowing by foreign banks, which will be granted national
treatment in the national interbank market.
</P>
<P>
The new regulations will also authorize foreign banks to issue
negotiable Certificates of Deposit (CDs) and open up more channels
of funding sources to encourage them to increase RMB loans in
China. Foreign banks will also be allowed to join Chinese banks to
launch RMB syndicated loans, according to the deputy central bank
governor.
</P>
<P>
"All these measures are conducive to attracting foreign
investment, encouraging competition in the banking sector, and
creating better financial products," said Liu.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's exports and
imports declined by 11.5 percent and 21.7 percent respectively in
terms of U.S. dollars in July, the first month of new fiscal year,
as compared to the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official figures Pakistan's exports
during July touched 586 million dollars as compared to 662 million
dollars in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports in July also came down to 704 million
dollars as compared to 899 million dollars in the corresponding
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of the Commerce Ministry Iqbal Farid told the media
Tuesday that the situation arose after the nuclear tests changed
the scene of Pakistan's trade, "although there is no impact of the
sanctions on trade."
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and other G-8 countries imposed
economic sanctions on Pakistan after it conducted nuclear tests at
the end of May following the similar tests by India earlier in the
month.
</P>
<P>
Farid said that the government's new trade policy would put
very healthy effect on Pakistan's economy. He believed that after
September Pakistan's exports would be improving.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government is expected to save more than
three billion dollars during the current fiscal year (July 1 to
June 30) "by cutting unnecessary imports."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, Laos Agree to Increase Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Laos Tuesday
agreed to increase bilateral trade through the means of barter
trading.
</P>
<P>
The consensus was reached between Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and his Laotian counterpart Sisavath Keobounphanh
during their talks here, Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad
Badawi told reporters after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said barter trade was one of the ways to increase
trade volume between the two countries, both members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
To increase the bilateral trade, Malaysia and Laos also agreed
to further discuss the mechanism of using currencies of Malaysia
and Laos, he said, adding the mechanism was being implemented
among some ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
For barter trade, Abdullah said the ministers concerned of the
two countries would discuss and decide the scope and areas.
</P>
<P>
As an outcome of the talks, Malaysia and Laos Tuesday signed
here a bilateral Agreement on Trade which provides the status of
the Most Favored Nation to each other.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, bilateral trade between Malaysia and Laos has
been increasing with the trade volume in 1997 amounting to 6.49
million ringgit (1.67 million U.S. dollars), an increase of 27.3
percent over that in 1996, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade for the first five months of this year amounted
to 3.4 million ringgit (0.9 million U.S. dollars), the latest
figures show.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Malaysia also agreed to help Laos in its nation-
building efforts as the two countries have similar objectives in
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is willing to share its development experience,
especially in rural development, with Laos, and officials from
Laos are welcomed to come to Malaysia to learn, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Malaysia and Laos also signed an Agreement on
Cooperation in Tourism.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia and Laos have already signed a number of agreements

<P>
KIEV, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
has submitted three accords regarding the former Soviet Black Sea
Fleet for parliament ratification, said the presidential press
office on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma's move is to create a better atmosphere for him and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin to meet in Kharkov on September
18-19.
</P>
<P>
The accords, signed by the Ukrainian and Russian prime
ministers on May 28, 1997, set the terms for basing Russian ships
in Ukraine's Sevastopol port for 20 years. Under the accords,
Russia should pay Ukraine 100 million U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed the Treaty of Friendship,
Cooperation and Partnership during Yeltsin's visit to Ukraine last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament approved the treaty without mentioning
the Black Sea Fleet accords on January 14.
</P>
<P>
In Russia, some State Duma members insisted that the accords
and the treaty should be discussed together, and they asked the
Ukrainian parliament ratify the accords first.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian parliament is now on summer vacation and it will
resume business at the beginning of September.
</P>
<P>
It is still to be seen whether the parliaments of the two
countries can ratify the accords before Kuchma and Yeltsin's
formal meeting in September.

<HEADLINE> Gore Warns of Worsening Global Warming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
warned Monday that the record hot month of July and the
consecutive seven months of record high temperatures reflects a
dangerous trend certain to get worse unless steps are taken to
stop global warming.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, the average global temperature last month was 61.7
degrees Fahrenheit (16 degrees Celsius) higher than the long-term
average for July and higher than the previous record for the month
set last year.
</P>
<P>
"This was the hottest July in the history of the world since
modern records have been kept," Gore said in releasing the data at
the White House.
</P>
<P>
"July wasn't just the hottest July on record, it was the
hottest month on record. The hottest month since we began to keep
reliable records more than 118 years ago," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
Gore said that the heat waves, droughts, powerful storms and
flooding that have struck parts of the United States and the world
this year will get worse unless greenhouse gas emissions are
controlled.
</P>
<P>
Gore said, "we will suffer even more of these natural disasters
in the future because there is growing evidence that we are
dangerously warming our planet."
</P>
<P>
"Now when you break the record every single month, seven months
in a row, it is really hard to ignore the fact that something is
going on, and what that something is is global warming," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
The vice president urged the U.S. Congress to back moves to
stop global warming.
</P>
<P>
"The good news is we can stop that from happening," he said.
"We can take steps to control the pollution that's causing this."
</P>
<P>
"If we don't do something about it, then what we've
been experiencing this summer... is going to get to be a lot more
common and it will get worse."
</P>
<P>
The Kyoto pact signed last December calls for industrial
nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an average of five
percent below 1990 levels by the year 2010. But U.S. opponents say
the treaty would hurt the U.S. economy and favors developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
Gore urged Congress to take other actions and he announced
Monday that the nation was creating eight federal research centers
dedicated solely to studying the environmental threats to
children.

BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of China's
central bank today warned both international and domestic
speculators not to attack the Renminbi yuan.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to advise the speculators that China is a big
player. Don't miscalculate," Liu Mingkang, Deputy Governor of the
People's Bank of China, said at a press conference here this

</P>
<P>
Liu explained that China has a huge reserve of foreign
exchanges and has enjoyed a trade surplus for the past years as a
result of sustained high economic growth, which provide a sound
basis for the yuan stability.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China's trade surplus totaled 22
billion U.S. dollars in the first six months this year and its
foreign exchange reserve stands at 140.5 billion U.S. dollars at
present.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, China still keeps tight control over capital flows
under the capital account. That brings us a lot of good," he said.
</P>
<P>
He once again ruled out the possibility of any devaluation in
Renminbi yuan, stressing that "there is no need for the yuan to
devalue and it will not devalue."

<HEADLINE> Demand for Warehouse Capacity Shrinks in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Sharply reduced demands in
various sectors have resulted in a 75 percent plunge in major
warehouse companies in Thailand during the first seven months of
this year compared to the same period last year, The Nation
newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sub Sri Thai Warehouse, the largest of four major warehouse
firms in Thailand, said that construction materials, steel and
chemicals are among the worst affected by the credit crunch and
sharp fall in demand for industrial goods.
</P>
<P>
The firm reported a 2.14 million baht (53,500 U.S. dollar)
profit for the first quarter of this year, a nose-dive from the
20.97 million baht (524,250 dollar) profit in the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The firm is planning to enter new markets, including the
automobiles foreclosed by finance companies and agricultural
products, to increase revenue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Krungthep Sophon plc, another listed operator, said
the economic problem had resulted in a net loss of 18.65 million
baht (466,250 dollar) in the first six months of this year
compared to a net profit of 2.71 million baht (67,750 dollars) in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
United Standard Terminal plc also turned red with a loss of
30,000 baht (750 dollars) for the first quarter of 1998, compared

last year.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Direct Investment In Sri Lanka Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)
in Sri Lanka has increased by 30 percent to 85 million U.S.
dollars during the first six months of this year compared to the
same period last year, according to Board of Investment sources
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The sources said the growth in FDI in the first six months of
this year is indicated by a 26 percent growth in imports of
capital goods and a 20 percent growth in new projects that have
commenced construction.
</P>
<P>
They said that part of the reason for this dramatic growth was
the increase in the types of incentives available under the Board
of Investment Law announced in the last Budget.
</P>
<P>
Among the big investments were several large projects in the
property development sector such as construction of several high
buildings and medium-to-low-cost housing projects.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, 28 manufacturing projects
with foreign investment commenced construction, of which the
largest ones are projects by companies engaged in rubber based
manufacturing, manufacturing zippers and printed circuit Boards,
the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Duff &AMP; Phelps Credit Rating Company Lowers India's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A U.S.-based international
credit rating agency, Duff and Phelps Credit Rating Company (DCR),
has downgraded the foreign currency rating of India to BB+ from
BBB- and the local currency rating to BBB from BBB+ in light of
significant fiscal slippage and the potential for balance of
payment deterioration in the coming years, 'The Observer of
Business and Politics' reported here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
DCR is the third major credit rating agency after Moodys and
Standard and Poors to have downgraded India's rating since this
year.
</P>
<P>
DCR said that fiscal pressures intensified in India in 1997-98
(April 1 1997-March 31 1998) leading to a deficit of 6.1 percent
of GDP against the government's target of 4.5 percent. The 1997-98
out-turn and the 1998-99 budget and its 5.6 percent of GDP deficit
target -- recently released by the BJP-led government -- are
inconsistent with DCR's previous expectation of gradually
narrowing fiscal imbalances.
</P>
<P>
Measures designed to stimulate the lackluster performance of
the domestic industry, such as an import levy of 4 percent,
reflect the new government's more protectionist approach towards
the economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Persistent high fiscal deficits are likely to postpone
reduction in the Central government debt (at 61 percent of GDP in
1997-98) and the government's very high interest burden (at 47
percent of government revenues in 1997-98), DCR said.
</P>
<P>
DCR also expressed concern over the pace of economic reforms
under India's coalition governments. Previous coalition
governments have been restrained in making bold and much needed
economic reforms. Differing priorities within the present
coalition could constrain the government's ability to undertake
critical reforms in the areas of fiscal consolidation,
privatization, infrastructure development and export promotion.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The situation at the border between
Peru and Ecuador remained "peacefully tense," a Peruvian
information officer said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation is normal, there is no problem, Peruvian
soldiers are keeping a positive attitude," said Colonel Carlos
Zumaeta, head of the border information office.
</P>
<P>
The border disputes between the two countries flared up again
last week with Peru accusing Ecuadoran troops of infiltrating into
its territory.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian special contingents were reported to have stayed
alert at the border areas.
</P>
<P>
The border disputes developed into three armed clashes in more
than half a century. The two Andean countries have tried many
times to negotiate a lasting solution to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Both countries have called for a continuation of bilateral
talks on the disputes.
</P>
<P>
Martha Chavez, a parliamentary member of the ruling party, said
recently that Peru should try all peaceful ways to end the border
disputes with Ecuador.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar NGO to Promote Public Anti-drug Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A workshop, sponsored by a
non-governmental Myanmar anti-narcotic drug association, is being
held here to work out a project for promotion of public
participation in eradication of drug abuse and control of AIDS in
the country.
</P>
<P>
The five-day workshop, which began Monday, is supported by the
government and assisted by the United Nations Drug Control
Program.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper New Light of Myanmar quoted Deputy
Minister of Home Affairs Brigadier-General Myint Maung as saying
that Myanmar is laying down a project for prevention of HIV/AIDS
through promotion of reproductive health and conducting of
life-long courses for housewives.
</P>
<P>
There were 17,846 HIV positives and 2,337 AIDS cases reported
in Myanmar as of the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister disclosed that the project for total
elimination of narcotic drugs within 15 years, already laid down
by the government, will be initiated in 48 townships in the
country's Shan, Kachin, Kayah and Chin states following the
successful transformation of eastern Shan state's Mongla region
into an opium-free zone in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
The country promulgated the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic
Substances Law in 1993, followed by the formation of the Central
Committee for Drug Abuse Control, undertaking the implementation
of drug control projects aimed at uplifting the living standard of
border region inhabitants and eradicating poppy cultivation.
</P>
<P>
These objectives are being carried out through three strategies
-- production eradication, demand reduction and law enforcement --
in accordance with the policy of the country to change the mind of
poppy farmers, drug producers and addicts, and to bring about
smooth transportation between the hills and the mainland and
uplift socio-economic life of the ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, in the first six months of
this year, Myanmar seized a total of 4,927 kilograms (kg) of
narcotics including 219 kg heroin and 4,471 kg opium, and 2.38
million tablets of stimulant drugs, destroying 15 heroin
refineries and over 8,000 hectares of poppy plantations and taking
action against 2,300 people in drug-related cases.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks to Have Access to RMB Business in Shenzhen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The People's Bank of China
announced here today that it has authorized Shenzhen in Guangdong
Province as the second city, following Shanghai, to experiment
with the RMB business by foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more foreign banks will obtain the license of RMB
business in the Pudong New Area in Shanghai, where nine foreign
banks have obtained approval to experiment with RMB business, Liu
Mingkang, deputy central bank governor, told a press conference
this morning.
</P>
<P>
Regulations governing the experiment of RMB business by foreign
banks will also be improved with the aim to attract more foreign
investment and provide better financial products, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
China first authorized Pudong as the first area for experiment
with RMB business by foreign banks in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Granting more foreign banks the access to RMB business is
necessary for China's economic and financial development and also
signals the strong commitment of the Chinese government to further
opening the nation's financial sector to the outside world," said
Liu.
</P>
<P>
Liu also explained that the central bank has a good reason to
choose Shenzhen as the second experiment site for RMB business by
foreign banks, because Shenzhen is a financially open city and the
local branch of the People's Bank of China has become quite
experienced in supervising and regulating foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen currently has 25 foreign bank branches.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, August 11 (Xinhua)-- The autonomous regional
government has started a literacy and education drive to teach
farmers new agricultural management techniques, which is
considered as Project Hope for anti-poverty by local farmers,
China Daily said today.
</P>
<P>
In Ningxia, inhabited by the Hui ethnic minority people in
Northwest China, farmers' education and the region's economy have
long lagged behind other parts of the country. In 1990, 22.06
percent of its 5.6 million people were illiterate.
</P>
<P>
Started eight years ago, Project 231, as it is called, aims to
help local farmers learn to read and use new agricultural and
management techniques to improve their crops and help ease
poverty, said a local official in charge of education and culture.
</P>
<P>
She said that by the end of 1997, the region's illiterate
population fell to 18 percent. And 90.5 percent of young and
middle-aged farmers can read and write, up 20 percent from eight
years ago.
</P>
<P>
The autonomous region also established 59 model township for
scientific and technological development, 877 model villages for
techniques and education and 56,778 midel families for farming
technology which have played a leading role in agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Project 231 was honored by the UNESCO for its success
in educating farmers.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Sets Up 17 Industrial Zones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has set up 17 industrial
zones across the country in an effort to promote the development
of its industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
These zones include those in Yangon, Mandalay, Bago, Hinthada,
Myaungmya, Myeik, Yenangyaung, Pyay, Mingyan and Meiktila.
</P>
<P>
Industrial zones in Yangon and Mandalay are reportedly gaining
momentum to certain extent.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the zones is aimed at manufacturing import
substitute goods and promoting export, ensuring regional
development and creating more job opportunities for local people,
according to the country's Industrial Development Committee,
formed with a number of ministers in July 1995 to give greater
impetus to the industrialization process.
</P>
<P>
In striving for industrial development, Myanmar has called for
extensive participation of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
So far, there emerged more than 51,000 private industries along
with 1,600 state-owned and 637 cooperative-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A state-private operated Industrial Development Bank was also
set up in February 1996, disbursing loans to industrialists as a
support to them for the engagement.
</P>
<P>
The government has laid down some five objectives for
developing the industrial sector which include development of
agro-based industries, raising of the quality and quantity of
industrial products and production of machinery and spare parts as
well as new industrial items.
</P>
<P>
Besides encouraging local citizens to engage in establishing
the industrial zones, Myanmar has also induced foreign investment
in the infrastructural development of the zones with companies
from Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand building up three
zones out of five in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
According to an annual official report of Myanmar's economic
condition, the country's industrial sector grew by 5.3 percent in
its output value in 1997-98 fiscal year which ended in March,
sharing 9.2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) and
standing as the second largest contributor to the GDP after
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the sector amounted to 1.43 billion U.S.
dollars in 113 projects at the end of the fiscal year, also taking
up the second position after oil and gas sectors out of the total
foreign investment of 7 billion dollars.

<P>
KUNMING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The government of Kunming City,
capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, has decided to ban
household sewage and industrial waste water dumpings from entering
into Dianchi Lake, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Dianchi, known as the "pearl" of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau,
was seriously polluted by sewage flowing into it from Kunming City.
</P>
<P>
Kunming City which borders the lake used to discharge 185
million cubic meters of waste water annually into the lake.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Kunming government said that the city
invested more than 2 billion yuan (241 million U.S. dollars) to
find a way to stop polluting the lake with four sewage treatment
plants being set up.
</P>
<P>
The plants now handled two-thirds of the city's waste water,
which help improve the water quality of Dianchi in line with
national and international standards.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, China has decided to allocate huge
funds for tackling the pollution problems in three lakes and three
rivers including Dianchi Lake, Taihu Lake, Chaohu Lake as well as
the Huaihe, Haihe and Liaohe rivers.

SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Colombian Foreign
Minister Guillermo Fernandez Monday denied that the possibility of
a conflict exists between his country and the United States over
differing views in the battle against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
On the anti-drug memorandum presented by the U.S. government to
the Colombian government in June, 1998, Fernandez said the time
the two countries had established to evaluate the previous
anti-drug war program had expired.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, the United States demanded Colombia carry
out a full anti-drug policy, enforce more strict punishment on the
drug lords, extradite drug traffickers in custody, and strengthen
the fight against corruption related to drug trafficking.

The minister said the program was based on cooperation between

<HEADLINE> NBA to Offer Refunds to Season Ticket Holders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The NBA authority said
Monday that it will offer refunds plus interest to season ticket
holders for all teams if any games in the 1998-99 season are
cancelled.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came four days a collective bargaining
session between NBA owners and locked-out players broke up on an
acrimonious note, with the sides far apart and firmly entrenched
in their positions. The NBA is the only major pro sports league
that never has lost a game to a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, after last week's negotiating session there
seems to be a greater likelihood that the season may not start on
time," NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Season ticket holders make substantial financial commitments
to our teams and we think they should be treated fairly in the
unfortunate event that games are missed," Granik added. "A refund
policy that includes interest is the right thing to do in this
circumstance."
</P>
<P>
People holding individual game tickets for cancelled games
will receive cash refunds or a check by the teams.
</P>
<P>
The 1998-99 season starts November 3 with 10 games. Although
that is more than two months away, Thursday's session has
indicated the season most likely will not start on time.
</P>
<P>
The NBA called the tone of the union's new proposal
"insulting" and walked out of the meeting, which players called
"a slap in the face."
</P>
<P>
NBA owners voted 27-2 in March to re-open the agreement and
locked out players on July 1. The NBA Players Association filed a
grievance, requesting quaranteed contracts of players be paid
during the lockout.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Unilateral Efforts In Fishing Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Inspections will be conducted on
the Yellow and East China seas to ensure offshore fishing
moratoriums are upheld, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The continued unilateral moratorium practiced by China
indicates the nation's strong commitment to promoting sustainable
development of the fishery, said Yang Jian, deputy director of the
Fishery Bureau of the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"We hope neighboring countries, Japan, the Republic of Korea,
and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, will join our
efforts and require their fishermen to stop fishing in area where
a moratorium has been place," he said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
This year, fishing with trawlnets and other "hazardous fishing
gear" has been suspended until August 31 on the Yellow Sea north
of the 35-degree boundary, previously not included in the
moratoriums.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming inspections will focus on a "boundary line" -- 35
degrees north latitude.
</P>
<P>
There are another half month to go for the termination of the
moratorium on south of the line, which will require a double
effort to maintain order, according to Zhang Jianfan, division
director of the Yellow and Bohai Seas Fishery Bureau.
</P>
<P>
So far, six fishing boats in Zhejiang, an east China province,
have reportedly violated the ban on July 3, and each was fined
50,000 yuan, and the boats will not be returned to the fishermen
before the moratorium ends, said official with the East China Sea
Fishing Supervision and Management Bureau.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Alex Corretja of Spain
survived a protracted first rounder by winning the decisive
tiebreaker to advance in the ATP tennis championship in Mason,
Ohio on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Corretja needed three sets and more than two and a half hours
to nudge over Alex O'Brien 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 7-6 (9-7) in his first
hardcourt match since March.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to make a comeback after like 20 days off," said
Corretja who returned from a three-week vacation in Barcelona,
"it was my first match, so I was hungry to be on the court and
hungry to play tennis."
</P>
<P>
Corretja was ranked 12th in the ATP Tour rankings released
Monday and O'Brien, who had never ranked higher than 30th, was
happy enough to press Corretja to a third-set tiebreaker.
</P>
<P>
"I did a lot of positive things. I thought it was a good day
because I put a lot of pressure on him," O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the Mercedes Super 9 tournaments, the 2.45 million
dollars ATP Championship has a spectacular field. Of the top 10
players on tour, only sixth-ranked Greg Rusedski, sidelined by an
injury, is absent.

</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old Courier was defeated by 20-year-old Tommy Haas

JAKARTA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Flash floods in Indonesia's East
Kalimantan Province which have covered thousands of houses and
other buildings have also devastated almost 2,000 hectares of rice
growing land, local press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At least 1,800 hectares of rice fields failed to be harvested
in Hulusungai Utara regency in the province following the rain
that hit the region last week.
</P>
<P>
In anticipation of a food shortage in the region, head of
Hulusungai Utara Agricultural Service Supomo said his office has
planted a fast growing rice variety on 4,000 hectares of land.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency Monday
predicted that rain in Jakarta, the northern areas of West Java,
Yogyakarta in Central Java and large parts of East Java, Sumatra,
Central and South Kalimantan and Sulawesi will continue to fall in
above normal frequencies for the remainder of the month.
</P>
<P>
Last month, large parts of Sumatra, Java, Kalimantan and
Sulawesi also enjoyed more rain than usual.
</P>
<P>
Agency head Sri Diharto told reporters here Monday that the
rainy season in Jakarta was predicted to come earlier than usual,
possibly later this month or in September. Normally, the rainy
season starts in Jakarta around October.
</P>
<P>
The agency thus warned Jakartans to prepare themselves against
the possibility of massive flooding.

<HEADLINE> World Scientists to Study New Zealand Seabed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- One of the biggest
international science ventures undertaken in New Zealand waters
will begin later this month with the arrival of an advanced French
research ship to carry out a program of deep sea drilling.
</P>
<P>
A Wellington-based newspaper Tuesday reported that scientists
from 11 countries, including New Zealand, France, Australia and
Britain, are due to join the flagship Joides Resolution as it has
drilled seven holes along the eastern coast of New Zealand to
retrieve sediment and rock for analysis.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion quoted New Zealand scientist Lionel Carter, one of
the researchers who will be on board, as saying that the project
is part of a global initiative to determine how the oceans tick
and influence climate.
</P>
<P>
The Ocean Drilling Program, set up in 1985 by 22 member
countries, has led 78 expeditions and overseen drilling at more
than 1,300 sites around the world.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand visit, dubbed "Leg 181" and hoping to uncover
the history of the South Pacific Ocean in the past 32 million
years, will last two months. The bill for the New Zealand leg has
been estimated at six million U.S. dollars, funded mainly by the
United States' National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
While conventional drilling ships typically work in water
depths of less than 200 meters, the Joides Resolution can work in
waters eight kilometers deep and then drill to one kilometer or
more below the seabed.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Carter said this is truly a remarkable capability
considering the ship will be bobbing in the ocean with 4 km of
rotating drill pipe snaking through current-swept waters to the
seabed and penetrating several hundred meters below to obtain the
core material.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand's eastern coast has been chosen because of its
position across the great current systems of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand is the visible part of a vast submarine continent,
half the size of Australia, that projects deep into the pathways
of the currents, Dr. Carter said.

PARIS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Drugs were detected in laboratory
tests from the substances seized from the TVM cycling team during
the Tour de France, officials from Reims said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There was caffeine found but also doping products," revealed
Reims' deputy public prosecutor Philippe Laumosne.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Cees Priem and Jan Moors, TVM's team director and
masseur, were released from custody on Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
But both men must remain in France and can not return to the
Netherlands under terms of their bail. Priem has been detained
for 18 days with Moors eight days.
</P>
<P>
Solicitor Joost van Mierlo said "this is a complete surprise,
but a good one. They are allowed go anywhere in France but
cannot leave the country. They must remain available until the
investigation is complete."
</P>
<P>
Both Priem and Moors face charges of contravening the 1989
French drugs act.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- A federal judge in Little
Rock, Arkansas, on Monday ruled that U.S. President Bill Clinton's
lawyer could view a videotape of Clinton's deposition in Paula
Jones' sexual-harassment lawsuit against the president, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's private lawyer David Kendall wants to see the tape
before Clinton's appearance before the grand jury investigating
allegations the president had an affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky and tried to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
The tape was made at the White House on January 17. On the
tape, sources have said, Clinton denies a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky testified before a grand jury last week and Clinton
will give a live deposition via closed-circuit television to the
same panel.
</P>
<P>
Judge Susan Webber Wright said Kendall would be subject to the
gag order she imposed in Jones' case last October and that he
would not be able to make a copy of the video.
</P>
<P>
Jones had objected to Kendall's watching the videotape at all
unless one of her lawyers also was present.
</P>
<P>
Wright dismissed Jones' suit on April 1, saying that Jones
could not prove her case and had no chance to win at trial. Jones
has appealed.

<HEADLINE> German Parties Get Ready for Fierce Election Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of German political parties
emerged from several weeks of Summer holidays and settled down to
business on Monday to prepare for the national elections just 48
days away.
</P>
<P>
After a strategic meeting of his ruling Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) party, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told reporters in
Bonn that the chance of another election victory for his party had
been increasing from day to day though the CDU was still trailing
its arch-rival Social Democratic Party (SPD) in opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Kohl again ruled out the much-speculated possibility that his
party would form a so-called grand coalition with the SPD after
the elections, saying that none of CDU leaders wanted that
coalition.
</P>
<P>
The SPD, meanwhile, also voiced optimism on Monday about its
own victory.
</P>
<P>
After a leadership meeting of his own party in Bonn, SPD
Chairman Oskar Lafontaine said he believed that the old tactics
used by Kohl's ruling coalition would not help this time because
the public mood for a political change in Bonn was too strong.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming general elections of Germany will put Kohl, the
veteran German chancellor since 1982, against a new face from the
SPD, Gerhard Schroeder, who is premier of the western German Lower
Saxony state.
</P>
<P>
The latest opinion poll released by the German Emnid polling
institute on Monday showed that Kohl was narrowing the strong lead
enjoyed by Schroeder over the past few months with the election
day approaching.
</P>
<P>
The Emnid survey put the current support rate for the leftist
SPD at 41 percent compared with 38 percent for Kohl's
conservatives. About one fourth of German voters had not yet made
up their mind which party they would vote for, the institute said.

LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- More tourists than ever before
visited some of England's best-known landmarks last year,
according to figures released Monday by the English Tourist Board
(ETB).
</P>
<P>
A record 71 million tourists flocked to England's historic
sites including the Tower of London and Canterbury Cathedral. The
number has risen for the third consecutive year and is two percent
up from the year 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Tower of London was the top draw with more than two and a
half million visitors, the ETB said.
</P>
<P>
"Investment in new facilities, refurbishment and
interpretations are encouraging even more people to visit
England's wealth of historic properties." David Quarmby, chairman
of the ETB, said about the leaps in tourists numbers.
</P>
<P>
"Imaginative marketing and longer opening hours are also paying
dividends." David Quarmby said.
</P>
<P>
English tourists in 1998 will show even better figures,
especially with the addition of some new attractions.

<HEADLINE> Annan Sends Envoy to Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan sent his special representative in Baghdad Prakash Shah
back with his message on Monday, trying to persuade Iraq to comply
with U.N. requirements in arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
U.N. spokesman Juan Carlos Brandt confirmed that Shah was on
his way back to Baghdad after meeting with Annan over the weekend
in Lisbon where Annan is attending the World Youth Forum.
</P>
<P>
Brandt declined to go into details of Annan's message to the
Iraqi government, except to say that it is not very different with
Annan's latest public statements before he left for Lisbon on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Annan has issued an invitation to Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz to come to New York for talks on the arms
inspection issue, Brandt said Annan had put the idea to the
Security Council and it is for the Council to decide.
</P>
<P>
Iraq last Wednesday decided to suspend cooperation with U.N.
arms inspectors until the U.N. Special Commission for disarmament
in Iraq, or UNSCOM is "reformed", complaining that UNSCOM is
pro-U.S. and attempting to prolong the arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Calling the Iraqi decision as "unacceptable", Annan urged the
Council to engage Iraq more closely in finding the way to resolve
the differences as he judged that Iraq's position is not a closed
one.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Iraq to Comply with Arms Inspection Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 10 (Xinhua)-- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan, who is paying a five-day visit to Portugal, said today
that he was pressing Baghdad to avoid a showdown over arms
inspection and seriously carry out the agreement on the inspection
he signed with the Iraqi leaders in Baghdad in February.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the remarks to reporters after he spoke
with his special representative in Baghdad Prakash Shah, according
to reports reaching here from Lisbon.
</P>
<P>
Shah went to Lisbon to report to Annan on his efforts to
persuade Baghdad not to carry out the announcement on suspension
of cooperation with the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge
of scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad made the announcement after the talks on further arms
inspection between UNSCOM chairman Richard Butler and Iraqi
officials broke down Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council said later last week that the Iraq's
decision was "totally unacceptable", and urged it to resume its
cooperation with the UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been calling for an earlier lifting of the eight-year
U.N. sanction, but the Security Council could not make the
decision before the UNSCOM's certification that Iraq is free of
all prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that his envoy would "go back with a strong firm
message urging the Iraqis to change their position."
</P>
<P>
"I hope they will listen and I hope we will be able to find a
way out," said Annan, who avoided a U.S. and British military
strike against Iraq by signing the peaceful agreement in February.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said that until the latest impasse, Iraq
had been cooperating well with the U.N. arms inspection teams.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Test Milk Amid Bacteria Fear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 10 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
ordered a nationwide survey into milk quality amid fears that a
bacteria affecting cattle could be causing diseases in humans.
</P>
<P>
The survey will include all main types of milk, with over 1,000
samples being examined, the British Ministry of Agriculture,
Fisheries and Food (MAFF) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The work, to be carried out by Queen's University, Belfast and
the Agriculture Development Advisory Service, will cost 200,000
pounds (327,000 U.S. dollars) and take 18 months to complete.
</P>
<P>
The samples will be assessed for a range of bacteria including
mycobacterium paratuberculosis, which is thought to be linked to
Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammation affecting the intestine in
humans.
</P>
<P>
Mycobacterium paratuberculosis is the cause of Johne's disease,
a disorder affecting cattle across the world, and is one of
several factors suggested as a possible cause of Crohn's disease.
</P>
<P>
Early results from a small number of samples have shown the
bacteria may be present in pasteurised milk, although to a lesser
extent than in raw milk.
</P>
<P>
But the MAFF said in a statement that "The findings are
unconfirmed and the survey has been adapted to investigate this in
more depth."

BONN, August 10 (Xinhua) -- German customs authorities
announced Monday that they had seized a large number of illegally
copied computer programs worth about 108 million German marks (60
million U.S. dollars) near the German-Dutch border.

The illegal copies, with computer programs of the U.S. software
giant Microsoft as the main target, were seized in a truck coming

A 38-year-old U.S. citizen, who lives in the Netherlands and
