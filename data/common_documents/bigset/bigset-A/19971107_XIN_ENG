<HEADLINE> France Welcomes Iran's Chemical Weapons Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- France today welcomed the
ratification by Iran of the convention banning the production and
ownership of chemical weapons, describing the move as "a positive
and appreciable development."
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
France received, with satisfaction, news of the ratification which
"makes up an important step toward the universalization of the
convention."
</P>
<P>
"In a general way, we encourage all states which have not yet
made the decision to ratify the convention, notably in the Middle
East, and to rally themselves to this dynamic," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Israel, Egypt, Syria and Iraq are among the major Middle East
countries which have not yet ratified the Convention on
Interdiction of Chemical Arms.
</P>
<P>
Signatories must destroy their chemical weapons and production
plants within 10 years, and provide detailed information about the
production and exports of listed chemicals which could be used to
make such weapons.
</P>
<P>
They are also obliged to open their chemical plants to the
Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons for routine
and short-notice inspections.

year's International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) Pro Tour Grand
Finals from December 18-21 at the Elizabeth Stadium, the Hong Kong
Table Tennis Association said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As only the top 16 players on the Pro Tour rankings are
eligible for the event, it is impossible to predict now the final
field for the four-day event. There are still four events
remaining on this year's Pro Tour -- the Yugoslavian Open and
Austrian Open later this month and the French Openand the Swedish
Open in December.
</P>
<P>
The ITTF, the sport's world governing body, will work out the
final Pro Tour rankings after the final four tournaments thus,
which will then decide who are eligible for the Hong Kong
tournament.
</P>
<P>
China now has four players amid the top ten in the men's
singles rankings, namely Kong Linghui, Yan Sen, Ma Lin and Wang
Liqin.
</P>
<P>
Also in the top ten are Belgian Jean-Michael Saive, Croatia's
Zoran Primorac, Johnny Huang of Canada, Kim Taek Soo from South
Korea, Jan Ove Waldner of Sweden ad Frenchman Christophe Legout.
</P>
<P>
And among the top ten are six Chinese including Olympic and
world champion Deng Yaping, Ni Xia Lian, a former menber of the
Chinese national team who now plays for Luxenbourg, two from South
Korea, and one from Chinese Taipei.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's ace Chai Po Wa is now ranked eleventh, which makes
her one of the possible entrants for the Hong Kong Grand Finals.
</P>
<P>
Set on the program for the Hong Kong event are men's and
women's singles preliminaries on December 18, the singles and
doubles quarter-finals on December 19, the singles and doubles
semifinals on December 20 and singles and doubles finals on
December 21.  Endite

<HEADLINE> Agreement Elusive on European Employment Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Two weeks prior to the
European Union (EU) job summit, ministers in the European Council
still seem far from agreeing on how to iron out their differences.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers spent a long Wednesday airing their sometimes
poles-apart views while discussing the guidelines for member
states employment policies in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's discussions concluded without an expected press
conference, and the discussion continued today for what looked
likely to be another prolonged working day for the ministers.
</P>
<P>
Today's meeting was said to be held with consensus that the
problem of unemployment has to be solved through entrepreneurship,
employability, adaptability and equal opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The ministers agreed that they have to move toward concrete and
quantifiable commitments for the guidelines which will be
delivered to the job summit. The summit later this month will be
in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
At stake will be how much each member state has to pay to
create a combined total of 25 million more jobs, if the union is
to solve the biting issue of unemployment which now runs at an
average high of 10.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is as high as 19.2 percent in Spain, 12.6 percent
in both Finland and France and 10.7 percent in Ireland. Though
the journal of European Report said that unemployment in Germany
was at 9.6 percent, the country itself announced its fifth
post-war record high of 11.7 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
The EU is already paying 200 billion ECU (229 billion
U.S. dollars) each year in unemployment allowances.
</P>
<P>
One EU spokesperson said the union was not calling for extra
expenditure on unemployment allowances. It was calling for
priorities to be offered in youth employment and long-term
employment.
</P>
<P>
European Commissioner Padraig Flynn, in charge of employment
and social affairs, said earlier this week that the shared task of
the ministers was to ensure that the EU did not remain the zone of
high unemployment as it had been for much of the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The EU is dedicating the present week as employment week, and
discussions and meetings are focused on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But observers here were left with the impression that before
the job summit, the questions of how much to pay in unemployment
allowances and in creating more jobs might still remain "a hard
nut to crack."

<HEADLINE> Canada Expected to Raise Interest Rates Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Economists and currency traders
are expecting the Bank of Canada to announce a rise of interest
rates as early as today or tomorrow, a report in the Financial
Post newspaper said today.
</P>
<P>
"There is a definite feeling that the bank is going to raise
rates any day," Steve Butler, a senior manager of foreign exchange
trading at Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia, said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe if the bank does not raise rates soon, it may
pay the price in further weakness in the Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
Coming under fire in the past two weeks as part of global
market volatility, the Canadian dollar closed at 71.39 U.S. cents
on yesterday's market.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Canada spent more than one billion dollars last
month to prop up the sagging currency in financial markets.
</P>
<P>
It has since stabilized partly because of the bank's defense
and partly because of the belief by then that the bank is poised
to raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The expected rate hike would be the third one since June. On
October 1, the central bank raised its overnight lending rate by
0.25 percentage points to 3.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the October hike, Gordon Thiessen, the central bank's
governor, indicated more hikes are in store.

LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England on Thursday
raised interest rates by 0.25 percent to 7.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Bank's Monetary Policy Committee said the rise was
necessary to meet an inflation target of 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank, which had left interest rates on hold for the
last two months, is expected to keep rates steady this month,
especially in the light of recent turmoil on world financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
Sterling immediately jumped on the news of the new interest
rates, rising to 2.9079/80 marks from 2.8933 just before the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
The stock market reacted negatively, with the dTSE 100 index of
leading British shares down around 32 points after the
announcement.

AMMAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan left here
today with Queen Noor for the United States to receive regular
medical checkup, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
This was the third time that 61-year-old Hussein went to the
Mayo Clinic for medical examination in Rochester, Minnesota, this

<P>
The king's health is good, a Jordanian official said on
condition of anonymity. The visit to the Mayo Clinic was a regular

Earlier in August 1992, Hussein underwent a successful cancer
surgery at the Mayo Clinic.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines Ready for El Nino: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has been well
prepared for the El Nino weather phenomenon which has already
begun to affect parts of the country, Environmental and Natural
Resources Secretary Victo Ramos said today.
</P>
<P>
In his speech to a forum on El Nino which opened here today,
Ramos said the Philippines is now in a better position to fight El
Nino after it took a series of measures to guarantee enough
supplies of water, food and power in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Ramos, the government has allocated millions of
pesos for water conservation projects and irrigation systems this
year.
</P>
<P>
The government planned to import a significant amount of corn
and rice early next year to prevent any food shortage caused by
dry spells as a result of El Nino, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government has already set aside a number of thermoelectric
equipment which can be used in case of a power shortage in
Mindanao, where 80 percent of power is hydropower.
</P>
<P>
During the one-day forum, experts and officials from various
government agencies discussed possible effects of the El Nino on
the country and ways to mitigate them.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino weather phenomenon is caused by the warming of
Pacific waters off South America, and is widely blamed for such
abnormal climatic activities as prolonged dry spells, warm winters
and heavy flooding.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, which occurs in the Pacific basin every two to nine
years, is predicted by weathermen to strike the Philippines and
other Southeast Asian countries late this year and will last until
the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Some El Nino-related phenomena, including delayed onset of
rainy season and weak monsoon activity, have been recorded in the
Philippines.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today signed a ratification on the international convention
banning the development, production, stocking and use of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Under Russian federal law, it is within the limits of the
president's authority to decide on the fundamental principles for
the reduction of chemical weapons, and on the security measures
and deadlines for the destruction of these weapons, the Itar-Tass
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The president, however, should guarantee the ability of Russia
to prevent other countries from developing, producing, stocking
and using chemical weapons, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Russia was among 165 countries that signed the ban in Paris in
1993. Yeltsin had long supported the ban and at his urging, the
State Duma (parliament's lower house) approved it last week. The
Federation Council (upper house) ratified it unanimously
Wednesday.

ABU DHABI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Algerian President Liamine
Zeroual today ended a two-day visit to Oman after discussing
with Omani leaders the latest developments in the Middle East
region, the United Arab Emirates' (UAE) Wam news agency said.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued shortly before Zeroual's departure
for home today, the two sides deplored the deadlock in the Middle
East peace process, saying it did not serve the realization of a
comprehensive, permanent and just peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
They also urged Israel to change its hardline policies and
return occupied lands to Arabs, Wam said.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said that the Algerian president also
discuss with Oman's leaders the upcoming fourth Middle East and
North Africa economic conference which was reportedly boycotted by
some Arab countries due to Israel's participation.
</P>
<P>
The controversial conference due in the Qatari capital of Doha
on November 16-18 has divided the Arab world. Algeria and Oman
have not yet voiced their stand.
</P>
<P>
Zeroual arrived in Oman Wednesday after attending the G-15
meeting held in Malaysia. He paid a visit to the UAE earlier
this month before heading for the meeting.

Last month, the State Duma, unsatisfied with the government's

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Government to Formulate Telecom Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
formulating a forward looking national telecommunications policy,
the national news agency BSS reported here today.
</P>
<P>
This was made by Bangladeshi Minister of Post and
Telecommunications Mohammad Nasim while presenting a keynote paper
on "Developing Telecommunication Infrastructure" at an investors
forum here today.
</P>
<P>
The policy, which is to be formulated, would be aimed at
developing an efficient and dynamic telecommunication
infrastructure to support a fast growing economy and welfare of
the country by providing telecommunication facilities on demand,
the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The strategic vision of the government is to facilitate
universal telephone service throughout the country, the minister
stated, and to achieve this objective, the government's role as a
service provider will diminish as the private sector's role
increases.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that the government is fully committed to
market-oriented economy, and has been pursuing policies through
which the private sector would play the dominant role in the
country's development efforts.
</P>
<P>
He assured the prospective foreign investors that government's
role would be to create a favorable environment to support this
new strategy.
</P>
<P>
The communications in Bangladesh has been characterized by low
tell-density, he stated, telephone density per 100 person is only
0.4 in 1997 compared to 0.22 in 1991, and density in rural area is
even lower -- 0.04 (1996 figure).
</P>
<P>
The minister said the target of expansion of telephone
penetration is fixed at 1.3 million line units including
associated inland and overseas transmission links and facilities
by the year 2000 in order to substantially eliminate the unserved
demand and increase the tele-density from 0.4 telephone to 1.0
telephone for every 100 persons.

<HEADLINE> Kathmandu Has 100 Child Prostitutes: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Out of some 5,000 prostitutes
in this capital city of Nepal, 100 are children who live a
wretched life, Nepal's official RSS news agency today quoted a
survey as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the child prostitutes are street children who took to
the flesh trade after being raped by other street children or
other people, and they are encouraged by their parents to make
ends meet, said the survey conducted by Childwatch, a
non-governmental organization.
</P>
<P>
The survey based on contacts with 50 child prostitutes shows
that their clients include schoolboys, police and army men,
porters, drivers, rickshaw men and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Though a child prostitute charges only five rupees (about 9
U.S. cents) to 100 rupees (about 1.7 U.S. dollars) each time, many
clients including policemen refuse to pay or even beat up her and
loot the money, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
These child prostitutes are unaware of AIDS and their clients
use no condoms, the survey added.

LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) - Kazakhstan has chosen China over
a raft of U.S. companies to develop its third largest oil field.
</P>
<P>
China will spend billions of dollars investing in pipelines
linking the oil-rich fields of Kazakhstan to China, according to
the latest issue of Petroleum Economist.
</P>
<P>
It was this commitment to Kazakhstan that helped the China

Amoco, Unocal, and Texaco for the prized onshore Uzen oil field,
east of the Caspian Sea, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Uzen has an estimated 207 million tons of recoverable reserves,
and is Kazakhstan's third largest oil field.

In return for exclusive rights to redevelop Uzen at a cost of
some 400 million U.S. dollars, China has agreed to invest in two
major pipelines, with a combined length of 3000 km in Kazakhstan.

NEW DELHI, November 6 (Xinhua) -- United Front (UF) spokesman

The present multi-party coalition government headed by Gujral

through the support of the Congress party from outside.
</P>

On press criticism of Gujral and cartoons lampooning his
foreign travels, Reddy further said, "I don't think the image of
any prime minister is determined by cartoons or headlines though
they are important in themselves. In recent weeks, his image as a
decent gentleman, as a conscientious prime minister, has been
strengthened, not weakened."

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Police Ask Drivers to Exercise Vigilance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan police Wednesday
asked operators of van hire services to be cautious of doping
activities conducted by criminals against them, police sources
said today.
</P>
<P>
This followed the arrest of eight men believed to be members of
a gang of vehicle thieves who went on bogus hires and later
hijacked vehicles after doping the drivers, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Police said the criminals pretended to befriend their driver.
Later the driver was invited to partake of some refreshments which
were spiked with sleep inducing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Once the driver lost consciousness he was moved to some
desolate place by the gang who took control of the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
In their latest operation, the gang hired a vehicle from the
Colombo Airport and ditched the driver in a suburb of the capital.
The vehicle worth 800,000 Rupees (13,560 U.S. dollars) was later
sold for 60,000 Rupees (1,000 dollars) after changing number
plates.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Australian sharemarket
rose today on a positive reaction to statements by Reserve Bank of
Australia (RBA) governor Ian Macfarlane.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index lifted 25.2 points, or nearly one
percent, to 2571.0.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said the market read confidence into Macfarlane's
comments, which were interpreted as meaning interest rates would
be stable in the near-term.
</P>
<P>
"I tend to believe there was some confidence taken from what
Macfarlane said," one Brisbane broker said.
</P>
<P>
"It does not look like interest rates are going to be cut and
they're unlikely to rise, so people are getting into the market
and looking principally for yield," he said.
</P>
<P>
Giving testimony to a Federal Parliamentary committee,
Macfarlane said monetary policy was now in an expansionary setting
and the RBA would maintain its present stance on the policy.
</P>
<P>
He said underlying inflation was likely to edge up over two
percent over the coming 18 months, and that figure was likely to
be between two and three percent by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In other economic news today, the October labor force figures
showed an unemployment rate of 8.4 percent, but brokers said the
one-month figure did not impact the market.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose 37.3 points to 4317.2.
</P>
<P>
Among the banks, National Australia Bank rose 23.5 cents to
21.45 Australian dollars. Other banks also improved, with
Commonwealth up 31.7 cents, ANZ 11 higher and Westpac six better.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index rose 16.1 points to 1187.2.
</P>
<P>
National turnover exceeded 330 million shares at a value of
more than 803 million Australian dollars (554.07 million US
dollars) with rises outnumbering falls 572 to 482.

<HEADLINE> Iranian FM's South African Visit Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi returned home today from his three-day visit to South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi said that he held "good and practical talks" with
ranking South African officials and signed two agreements and a
letter of intent.
</P>
<P>
The agreements dealt with avoiding double taxation and
encouraging and supporting reciprocal investments, and the letter
of intent envisaged granting banking credits to finance joint
projects.
</P>
<P>
However, local observers believed that Iran benefited more
politically than economically from Kharrazi's South African trip,
which they termed as an important step of President Mohammad
Khatami's government to break the U.S.-imposed isolation.
</P>
<P>
On the sidelines of the third Irano-South African Joint
Commission, Kharrazi spared no effort to introduce foreign
policies of Iran's new government by delivering speeches at the
South African Institute of International Affairs and the Foreign
Relations Committee of South Africa's Parliament.
</P>
<P>
In all his speeches and talks with senior South African
officials, Kharrazi pointed out that Iran was not a threat to
world and regional security and stability; on the contrary it
favors peaceful coexistence with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Pretoria and Tehran have close ties and cooperation. President
Nelson Mandela has repeatedly rejected the call of the United
States to stop cooperation with Iran, a stance highly praised by
Tehran.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will become chairman of the Non-Aligned Movement
(NAM) next year while Iran itself will lead the Organization of
the Islamic Conference (OIC) after the OIC summit here in December.
</P>
<P>
This provides "a rare opportunity for Iran and South Africa to
cultivate a fresh impetus for multinational cooperation based on
mutual interest and respect," as a local newspaper commented.

<HEADLINE> Four Rhinos Airlifted to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has imported
four black rhinoceros from South Africa for a game reserve, the
Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Mkomazi Game Reserve used to have a number of rhinos, but
greedy poachers killed them and Tanzania has to buy the animal
from outside, said a wildlife protection official.
</P>
<P>
Official figures put the cost of one rhino at 60,000 dollars
and air freight charges from South Africa to Dar es Salaam at
50,000 dollars per head.
</P>
<P>
Brigadier General Hashim Mbita, chairman of the Tanzania
Wildlife Preservation Trust Fund, urged residents around the
Mkomazi Game Reserve sanctuary to cooperate with wildlife
conservators in protecting rhinos.
</P>
<P>
The official warned that greedy individuals, who are prepared
to sell the national heritage at minimal prices through poaching,
can render game reserves barren.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has up to 25 black rhinos left, which calls for great
concern and care over the surviving ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
The four rhinos which arrived on Tuesday are the first
shipment of a total of 10 to be transferred from South Africa to
Tanzania in the coming six months.
</P>
<P>
The six-year-old rhinos are offsprings of seven members of the
east African black rhinos captured on the border between Tanzania
and Kenya which were shipped to South Africa in 1961. They have
bred up to 40, conservators said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan will very soon
become full-dialogue partner of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN), which will help increase economic cooperation and

According to official sources, Sharif also expressed his hope
on the occasion that the results of the meeting would be
beneficial to Pakistan as well as for the ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
While Pakistan is already a sectoral-partner of ASEAN, the
meeting would further strengthen the existing ties between
Pakistan and the ASEAN, Sharif said.
</P>
<P>
Datu Ajit Singh, who arrived here Tuesday, has said that the
meeting will help "evolve concrete and practical measures for
future collaboration between the two sides."
</P>
<P>
During today's meeting, a mechanism of future cooperation was
discussed in detail, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
It has been decided that a Pakistan-ASEAN business council, a
committee for ASEAN-Islamabad ambassadors and a committee for
sectoral cooperation will be set-up, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Pakistan and ASEAN had agreed to
establish a Sectoral Dialogue Partnership in areas including
trade, industry, investment, environment and science and
technology.

<P>
RIYADH, November 6 (Xinhua) -- China tied Saudi Arabia 1-1 at
half time in a World Cup Asian Group A qualifier in Riyadh, Saudi
Arabia, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China, who collected seven points from six games with two wins,
one draw and three losses, lost a golden chance to score in the
43rd minute when goal keeper M.A. Al-Daye saved a penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, who lost to China in the first leg 1-0, but
positions second in the group with 10 points, needs a victory to
keep alive its hopes to qualify.
</P>
<P>
The Arabians surged ahead three minutes after the whistle
through captain Khalid Al-Mowalad, who seized a loose ball one
meter from the goalmouth and put the home team in front.
</P>
<P>
China, whose dream of qualifying has virtually died unless it
beat Saudi Arabia and Kuwait with big wins, equalised the score in
the 12th minute when midfielder Hao Haitong headed a right cross
from Xie Feng.
</P>
<P>
The Arabians dominated the first five minutes and launched
offensive waves after waves, but Chinese found their rhythms after
then, and threatened the goal several times. The first half saw
referee flashed three yellow cards to the Chinese side.
</P>
<P>
Iran is the group leader with 12 points, but no one is yet to
qualify from this group.

in a thrilling packed game in a World Cup Asian Group A qualifier
in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Thursday.
</P>

With the draw, China, who only collected eight points from

if China wins the last battle against Kuwait, it is still an
also-run in the group.

Saudi Arabia, who has gained 11 points and ranks one point
drift from leader Iran, still need to win its last game to put

second if they win over their rivals in the last battles.
</P>

In today's game, a live-or-die matter for China, both sides
went all out and the Chinese team got six yellow cards to Saudi's
one.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Telecom Company to Sell Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Telecommunications
Company (JTC), an operator of Jordan's public telecommunications
network, is to sell 40 percent of its shares to foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In an advertisement in major local newspapers, the company said
its shares will be offered through a tender.
</P>
<P>
The proposed sale will make Jordan the first Arab state to
allow private foreign ownership of its telecommunications
network. This is Jordan's another major privatization move aside
from a long-planned sell-off of a 33 percent stake in the
state-owned Jordan Cement Factories.
</P>
<P>
The JTC tender is open to telecommunications operators who had
either services revenues of at least 3.5 billion U.S. dollars
equivalent in 1996, or at least 3.5 million access lines in
service by December 31, 1996, according to the advertisement.
</P>
<P>
The stake to be offered to foreign investors was originally set
at 26 percent of the total shares. Later in October, the
government endorsed a recommendation from a privatization body and
decided to raise it to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
JTC is expected to have exclusive authorization until December
31, 2002 to operate international, domestic long distance and
local basic voice telecommunications services in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The company will also be authorized to operate the second
cellular network in the country starting from November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Its assets are estimated at between 800 million Jordanian
dinars (about 1.1 billion U.S. dollars) to 1.5 billion dinars
(about 2.12 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Parliament, Attorney-General Amos Wako said

<HEADLINE> Russia Ready to Invest in ASEAN Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia is ready to invest in its
cooperation with the ASEAN, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady
Tarasov said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov told a press briefing that Russia can offer resources
and technologies in the cooperation with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations(ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
Recalling the status of an equal "partner in dialogue with the
ASEAN" obtained by Russia in July, 1995, Tarasov said the fund
adds an important constituent to the emerging infrastructure of
Russia-ASEAN cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Its main task is the advancement of Russian economic interests
in this dynamically developing region of the world, the pooling of
efforts of business circles and official organizations in that
direction."
</P>
<P>
The National Russia-ASEAN Cooperation Fund was unveiled on
Tuesday in Moscow during the first meeting of the Moscow ASEAN
committee.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin said at the opening
ceremony that deepening the relation with the ASEAN is as
important to Russia as building up the cooperation with China,
Japan and India.
</P>
<P>
The Fund is reportedly an indication of Russia's interest in
opportunities of economic cooperation with states of the
Asia-Pacific region.

LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The south runway at London's
Heathrow airport, which was closed on Wednesday night after an
emergency landing by a Virgin Atlantic Airbus, was reopened at
midday today.
</P>
<P>
The airport, the world's busiest international airport, was
returning to normal today as the plane was removed from the runway
after experts worked throughout the night to jack it up, according
to a BBC television report.
</P>
<P>
Its pilot was forced into an emergency landing when one set of
wheels failed to drop into position.
</P>
<P>
However, only six of the 114 people on board were taken to
hospital but none was seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
The incident led to the cancellation of several flights and is
still causing serious delays, British Airways Plc said.
</P>

ATHENS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Greece's cost of living index in
October reduced to 4.7 percent from 4.9 percent in September this

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Concerns over Liberia's Self Re-arming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's determination to
re-organize its army by its own efforts has aroused concern of the
west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, which is mandated by leaders
of the sub-region to be involved in the process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement today, ECOMOG Force Commander Victor Malu said
the Liberian government's re-arming of people had created a
situation that could preach such armed groups against his forces.
</P>
<P>
He said problems could arise if those rearmed used the weapons to
commit crimes that could be blamed on ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
Malu cited the case of the official weapons issued to a command of
special security services to one place in Liberia which were used to
an armed robbery attempt two months ago.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the security of Liberia was the major concern to
ECOMOG, saying "if anything happens to Liberia now, it is ECOMOG that
would be blamed."
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, which helped to bring peace to Liberia, is ordered by the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to be in charge of
Liberia's security during its six-month stay in Liberia after the
elected government was put in place in August this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a peace agreement to end the country's seven-year
civil war, ECOMOG should also help re-build and train the Liberian
armed force.
</P>
<P>
However, Liberian President Charles Taylor announced last month his
government would single-handedly re-organize an armed force of 1,000.
</P>
<P>
This seems to be a contravention to the ECOWAS peace plan signed in
August last year in Abuja, capital of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
In his first reaction to Taylor's announcement, Malu said: "ECOMOG
will be prepared to leave Liberia in December this year, if it is no
longer needed in the restructuring of the armed forces of Liberia."
</P>
<P>
"We would be more than willing to leave then if the government
demands it," Malu said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liberian Defense Minister Daniel Chea said, "The Abuja
peace agreement which calls the ECOMOG involvement in the formation of
the new Liberian army has ceased to exit with the coming into power of
the Charles Taylor-led government."

<HEADLINE> Dick Spring Resigns As Irish Labor Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Ireland's former deputy prime
minister and foreign minister Dick Spring announced in Dublin
today that he would step down as leader of the country's third
largest political Labor party.
</P>
<P>
Spring, who has been the leader of the Irish Labor Party for 15
years, told a meeting of Labor parliamentarians that he would
tender his resignation, according to press reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
"I have to advise the parliamentary party, with regret, that I
have decided to resign as leader of the Party," Spring said,
adding the best memories of his time in office centered on
mediating the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Spring, one of the longest serving political leaders in Europe,
gained international recognition during Ireland's six-month
European Union (EU) presidency by acting as chairman of the EU
Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party suffered a crashing defeat at the country's
general election last June and Spring had since been under
increasing pressure to stand down.

<HEADLINE> Irish Exporters Suffer from French Truckers Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The Irish Exporters' Association
(IEA) announced in Dublin today that about 10 million Irish pounds
(about 15 million U.S. dollars) of exports per day were severely
affected by the wide-spread French drivers' blockade.
</P>
<P>
IEA chief Colum MacDonnell was quoted by reports from Dublin as
urging for a radical shakeup of European transport to avoid such
incidents.
</P>
<P>
MacDonnell noted that perishable exports such as meat, fish and
dairy products, which accounted for an estimated 1.5 million Irish
pounds per day (about 2.3 million dollars), would be lost for
good.
</P>
<P>
"That is lost definitively. What they do not eat today they are
not going to eat tomorrow," he said. "If it goes on for a week
there will be 70 million pounds (about 105 million dollars)
postponed or distorted."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ireland's pharmaceutical, chemical and
computer companies, many of which are simply assembly plants that
rely on the delivery of components, had been hard hit by the
blockade in France.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Increase for Fourth Consecutive Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. factory orders for
chemical and metal products in September increased for the fourth
consecutive month, the Commerce Department reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Orders rose a moderate 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted
336.5 billion U.S. dollars after a large 1.2 percent advance in
August, according to the department.
</P>
<P>
The month's orders for durable goods -- big-ticket items such
as autos and computers -- inched up just 0.1 percent. Still, that
was considerably better than an earlier estimate of a 0.6 percent
decline.
</P>
<P>
Orders for non-durable goods jumped 0.8 percent, led by
chemicals and chemical products. All non-durable goods industries
reported increases except for petroleum and coal products and
food.
</P>
<P>
Durable goods orders were strongest for primary metals such as
steel, up 4.2 percent. Stone, clay and glass product orders rose 4
percent; instruments such as medical, measuring and navigation
devices and cameras, 3.6 percent; fabricated metals products, 2.7
percent, and industrial machinery, 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, orders for electronic equipment declined by 7.6
percent, after soaring 29.4 percent in August. Transportation
equipment orders fell 1.2 percent, pulled down by drops in
aircraft and autos.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of factory goods, a measure of current production,
rose 1.6 percent in September to a seasonally adjusted 335.3
billion dollars following a 0.8 percent drop in August, mainly
blamed to the United Parcel Service strike.
</P>
<P>
Despite the shipment increase, the backlog of unfilled orders
rose a modest 0.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted 528.2 billion
dollars following a 0.9 percent increase in August. Too rapid a
rise in unfilled orders is an inflation warning signal because it
implies factories are having problems keeping up with demand.
</P>
<P>
Factory inventories, up for the ninth consecutive month, also
rose 0.2 percent, to a seasonally adjusted 449.1 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Increase Overseas Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain today pledged a steady
increase in foreign aid spending from 1999.
</P>
<P>
In a policy White Paper which puts new emphasis on sustainable
development and elimination of poverty, International Development
Secretary Clare Short said the move reflected both a moral duty to
reach out to the poor and enlightened self-interest.
</P>
<P>
Britain's current 2.3 billion pound (3.9 billion U.S. dollars)
aid budget represents just 0.27 percent of national income,
compared with the official United Nations target for developed
countries of 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper said the government was "committed to reversing
the decline in the British development assistance budget" and to
the U.N. target.
</P>
<P>
It also reaffirmed Britain's commitment to halving the number
of people living in extreme poverty and achieving universal
primary education by 2015.
</P>
<P>
"The problems of international development can only be resolved
if there is the political will to address them in both poorer and
richer countries," the White Paper said.

<HEADLINE> Auto Giants Beef up Presence in Southeast Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 5 (Xinhua) -- Despite currency crisis in
Southeast Asia, automakers of the United States and Japan did not
lose heart in the region, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor is going to open its new factory in Vietnam on
Thursday and is expected to open more new assembly plants in other
parts of Southeast Asia, along with General Motors, the New York
Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
None of U.S. and Japanese automakers have closed a factory or
canceled expansion plans, the paper said, with a graphic showing
that even in Thailand, where the currency storm originated, G.M.
and Chrysler are to open their plants in the next 18 months.
</P>
<P>
G.M., which has opened 23 factories in East Asia and Southeast
Asia since 1992, aims at catching a market share of ten percent in
Asia Pacific by 2005, while Ford has projected to gain the same
size of market share within ten years.
</P>
<P>
Though some analysts see the move as unreasonable in view of
the impact of the currency crisis, the automakers think that the
impact is a short-term one.
</P>
<P>
"When the currencies settle down, as they will, I think they
may have a greater competitive advantage," Ford chairman and chief
executive Alexander J. Trotman was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Latin American Financial Services Poised for Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Despite market-related turmoil
in Latin America, a leading U.S. consulting firm said today that
there is still the potential for substantial growth in financial
services investment in the region.
</P>
<P>
Price Waterhouse, which provides audit services to 25 percent
of the 500 largest companies headquartered in Latin America,
considers the region's financial services market as one of the
most attractive in the world for investment.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a conference on Latin American financial services
here today, Price Waterhouse official Richard Silvagni said there
are several factors supporting his company's conclusions:
</P>
<P>
-- Foreign banks are competing for low-cost entry into
commercial and retail banking by acquiring local institutions.
</P>
<P>
-- Competition for lending to Latin American companies and
governments is intensifying.
</P>
<P>
-- Spending for infrastructure from all sources over the next
15 years could reach 150 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- Latin America has become the fastest-growing U.S. export
market, with U.S. Commerce Department expecting it to surpass
Europe as a U.S. customer by 2000 and Europe and Japan combined
by 2010.
</P>
<P>
-- Flight capital has returned, fueling the demand for
sophisticated consumer-oriented financial services.
</P>
<P>
Silvagni, who is managing partner of Price Waterhouse's Latin
American Business Center based in New York, said Latin America is
a region with 400 million people and a gross domestic product of
1.5 trillion U,S. dollars and 400 billion dollars in external trade
annually.
</P>
<P>
"While the environment is complex and sometimes volatile, the
opportunities are great," he said.

development, and will create a good climate for new investments
and for the development of trade with Australian partners.
</P>

The Australian guest welcomed the signing of the Russia-NATO
founding act, Moscow's support for the treaty on the
non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the Russian and U.S. efforts

into effect in last December and allows Iraq to sell 2 billion
dollars of oil within six months to buy food and other
humanitarian materials. The deal was renewed in last June.
</P>
<P>
Al Khashab, whose company runs the Egyptian Trade Center in
Iraq, said the newly-concluded contract brings to 46.5 million
dollars the total volume of contracts signed between Iraq and the
Egyptian public and private companies under the present stage of
the oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Holding Company for Food Industries has signed
contracts to export to Iraq foodstuffs worth 41.4 million dollars
within the second phase of the deal.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Egypt has also reached contracts to export medicines to
four African states for the first time. The medicines, worth 6
million dollars, will be shipped to Malawi, Zambia, Namibia and
Botswana from now to the end of the year, Ghorab said.
</P>
<P>
The company is currently negotiating to export medicines to the
Ethiopian markets, he added.

<HEADLINE> German Court Okeys Dismissal of Musician Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A Berlin court today confirmed the
legality of a Berlin opera's dismissal of one of its musician who
had signed a hotel bill in Israel with "Adolf Hitler" in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
The 54-year-old musician, Gerd Reinke, was dismissed by the
Deutsche Opera Berlin immediately after the incident was made
public and triggered strong protests in Israel in May.
</P>
<P>
Reinke later filed a lawsuit against his opera's decision,
citing reasons that he was drunken at the moment when he signed
the hotel bill and the move was only meant as a joke.
</P>
<P>
But the Berlin court rejected his complaint today, saying that
the opera had no alternative but to dismiss him. Otherwise, the
reputation of the opera and that of the city of Berlin would be
risked.

<HEADLINE> China Urges UN to Take Further Steps Against New Racism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
should shoulder important historical responsibilities and take
further actions to fight against new forms of racism, Chinese
delegate Xie Bohua stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assembly, Xie Bohua
said that since the inception of the United Nations, the struggle
against racism and racial discrimination had achieved great
results with historic significance.
</P>
<P>
But, Xie said, there were new forms of racism existing in some
Western countries in particular. There had been widespread
prejudice, discrimination, persecution, xenophobia and Neo-Nazism
bred by the differences in race, color, religion and belief.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the situation had asserted the struggle against new
forms of racism was calling for cross-century actions by the
international community. In this connection, he called on the
United Nations to take further actions.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese delegate said the United Nations should continue
to give priority attention to all forms of racism and racial
discrimination, particularly new forms of racism, which were
gross violations of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the United Nations should strengthen activities under
the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, and
actively support the work of the relevant UN mechanisms including
that of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination,
and provide necessary resources so that they would be in a better
position to play a greater role.
</P>
<P>
He added relevant countries should be urged to take political,
legal, economic and educational measures to effectively do away
with the causes for new forms of racism and racial discrimination
and earnestly address all problems facing them.

<HEADLINE> Quebec to Have Strong Growth Next Year, Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Quebec's economic growth in 1998
will be the strongest since 1988, with GDP expected to climb from
2.6 percent in 1997 to 3.8 percent in 1998, the Bank of Montreal
said today.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for Quebec's manufacturing pillars, including
forest products, aerospace and pharmaceuticals,is "generally
bright" and merchandise exports should remain robust through 1998,
the bank said in the 1998 Economic Outlook.
</P>
<P>
Tangible employment gains are forecast for a second year in a
row, with over 82,000 new jobs expected in 1998, bringing the
two-year total to just under 168,000.
</P>
<P>
"This represents the biggest two-year spurt since 1987-88 and
should help make a dent in the province's unemployment rate," said
Tim O'Neil, the bank's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
He expects the jobless rate in the Canadian province will fall
to 10.5 percent next year from 11.4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
"The main roadblock to stronger growth in Quebec will continue
to be cutbacks in the public sector," the economist noted.
</P>
<P>
Yet in the next two years, the negative impact on the economy
"should be less severe than this past year, as spending and staff
reductions moderate," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The international
community must safeguard the inherent meaning of the principle of
self-determination, a Chinese delegate stressed here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 52nd session of the General Assembly, Chinese
delegate Xie Bohua said that in accordance with the Charter of the
United Nations, UN Resolution 1514, the Vienna Declaration and
Program of Action and other international human rights
instruments, the right to self-determination was in essence the
right to maintain national independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Xie said it was also the right to struggle against foreign
aggression, interference and control, as well as the right to
determine a country's political future, social system and the road
to development by its own people.
</P>
<P>
Xie said the principle of self-determination should not be
treated as a premise on which ethnic questions within a state were
addressed and settled, still less should it be used as an excuse
to support or encourage activities aimed at splitting a country,
or violating its territorial integrity, sovereignty and
independence.
</P>
<P>
He said any acts, under the name of the right to
self-determination, designed to undermine the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of a state would only sow discord, lead to
national conflict and social turmoil or even pose threat to the
world peace and security.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Ontario Government to End Hydro's Monopoly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Ontario government said today it
will strip Ontario Hydro of its monopoly on the Canadian
province's electricity within two years.
</P>
<P>
The move will mean lower energy prices for consumers, create
new jobs and increase investment, the government said in a
discussion paper.
</P>
<P>
"Today we are flipping the switch on a more competitive and
responsive electricity system," said Energy Minister Jim Wilson of
Ontario, the most populous province of Canada.
</P>
<P>
"We are proposing to move away from a monopoly in generation
and retail to a new era of competition," Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
With the move, the monopoly enjoyed by North America's biggest
power utility will be ended by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The utility would be split into three separate companies -- one
that would generate electricity, another would transmit it to
customers and the third would manage the province's electricity
business.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern has voiced concern over a reported split of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA), which may threaten the Northern Ireland
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Independent newspaper reported that some 20 key IRA
figures had decided to leave the outlawed guerillas group in a row
over the Northern Ireland peace process.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the newspaper report, Prime Minister Ahern was
quoted by press reports from Dublin as saying today, "I am bound
to be concerned about any difficulties that could jeopardize the
peace process."
</P>
<P>
However, Ahern tried to play down the significance of the
report by saying, "I certainly do not want to overstate them. I
think it would be incorrect to do so. We are talking about a
relatively small number of people."
</P>
<P>
Political commentators said that the reported friction among
IRA guerillas would cast a long shadow over the IRA cease-fire and
the multi-party peace talks on the future of Northern Ireland.

<P>
OTTAWA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Canada will lead all G-7
countries in economic growth in 1998, the Bank of Montreal
predicted today in its annual Economic Outlook.
</P>
<P>
The bank is forecasting Canada's GDP to rise 3.8 percent this
year and 4.3 percent in 1998, and the country's jobless rate to
fall to 8.25 percent in 1998 and 8 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of growth and employment, 1997 and 1998 should be the
best back-to-back years since the late 1980s," said Tim O'Neil,
chief economist of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Led by strong consumer spending and business investment,
Canada's domestic demand has surpassed exports as the driving
force behind its economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government will come close to balancing its budget
this year with growing surpluses projected for the coming years,
the bank said.

<HEADLINE> Senate Committee Delays Vote on Civil Rights Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Senate Judiciary
Committee postponed action Thursday on President Bill Clinton's
nomination of Bill Lann Lee for Justice Department's civil rights
division.
</P>
<P>
Lee has been attacked for his support of affirmative action --
effort for increased employment and school admission opportunities
for women and ethnic minorities to overcome past discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the committee's top Democrat,
called for the delay, saying, "There has been nothing but
misstatements of his positions." Democrats want to give Lee
another chance to testify and respond to Republican objections.
</P>
<P>
The committee chairman, Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, agreed
to the delay and said he would reschedule the vote on the
nomination. Congressional leaders hope to recess for the year by
the end of this week but may extend their work into next week.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was keeping close track on the nomination from Texas
where he attended the dedication of the George Bush presidential
library, said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
Lee's supporters in the hearing room included members of the
Congressional Black Caucus, NAACP President Kweisi Mfume and the
Reverend Jesse Jackson.
</P>
<P>
Republican Senator Mitch McConnell said he expressed intention
to block the Senate from considering the nomination even if it
cleared the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
McConnell said Lee was unfit to be assistant attorney general
for civil rights because he has shown an "alarming allegiance to
racial preferences and a disturbing disregard for the
Constitution."
</P>
<P>
Any senator can block action on a bill or nomination so long as
the majority leader honors that "hold."
</P>
<P>
Lee, a Los Angeles civil rights attorney, supports affirmative
action, while McConnell and Hatch have sponsored legislation to
end affirmative action programs administered by the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General Janet Reno, who has been appealing for
approving Lee's nomination, said she and Eric Holder, her deputy,
had been telephoning Judiciary Committee members to lobby for
support. Ten votes would move the nomination to the Senate floor.
Lee was believed to have the votes of the panel's eight Democrats
and one of 10 Republicans on the committee.
</P>
<P>
Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy, described the situation as
"deplorable," and called Lee's nomination the year's "No. 1 civil
rights issue."

DAR ES SALAAM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of investment
promotion centers in Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda will gather later this
month in Kenyan capital of Nairobi to work out strategies for a common
East African investment area.
</P>
<P>
Executive Chairman of the Kenyan Investment Promotion Center,
Joseph arap Ng'ok, told a press conference here Wednesday that
the investment authorities will have a chance to exchange
experiences at the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Arap Ng'ok, who is on a tour of east African countries to
contact investment authorities and businessmen on the Nairobi meeting
scheduled for November 21-22, also said government investment policies
will be discussed for harmonization with investment activities.
</P>
<P>
Business organizations, including Confederation of Tanzanian
Industries, Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture, will
attend the meeting, according to a report in the Guardian.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kenya Investment Promotion Center has problems
similar to those in Tanzania. However, with more private investment
in the sector, the problems will soon become a thing in the past.
</P>
<P>
He also said Kenya, which is comparatively more developed than its
neighboring countries, could get more supplies of electricity from
Uganda and Tanzania, especially after the completion of the gas
project in Songosongo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tanzanian Investment Center will soon launch
courses across the country to equip businessmen with techniques of
negotiations in doing international business.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) today denied that its embassy in Baghdad was
being used as a repository for hiding Iraqi secret documents on
its buildup of unconventional weapons.
</P>
<P>
Azzam al-Ahmad, a PNA official in charge of Iraqi affairs,
noted that it was ridiculous to suppose that the Iraqis hided
documents at the Palestinian embassy, saying "(Iraqi President)
Saddam Hussein does not need Palestinian offices to hide
documents."
</P>
<P>
The official made the remark in reaction to the Iraqi
opposition sources' claim Wednesday that Saddam used the
Palestinian embassy in Baghdad to keep Iraqi secret documents
beyond the reach of the United Nations' weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that the hidden documents relate to the
purchase of raw materials required for Iraq's manufacture and
deployment of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat's political adviser Nabil Amr
today also rejected the charge, saying that he had "no idea
about this information."
</P>
<P>
The PNA embassy in Baghdad is situated in a private residence
of Arafat, which has "extraterritorial status", a report of
today's Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
The report disclosed that Iraq is ready to export oil
to the Palestinian self-rule area through Jordan in addition to
providing financial assistance as a compensation for the hiding
the documents.

"It is anticipated that this process will take approximatedly
three months and that a cabinet decision is to be expected towards

<HEADLINE> Washington Mideast Talks Ends with Some "Progress" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators said on Thursday that they made some progress in their
three-day talks near Washington, although no final agreement on
how to resume their peace talks suspended eight months ago.
</P>
<P>
Both Palestinian chief negotiator Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy made the above comment after they met
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at the State Department
at the end of their talks, which was aimed at breaking the impasse
in their peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good beginning," Abbas told reporters. "We did not
reach an agreement but we found a good deal of understanding and
common ground on each other's needs."
</P>
<P>
Levy also struck an optimistic note by saying that they had
made "good progress" and that trust had been restored between the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that they still have much work to do, "but we
will do it together."
</P>
<P>
Both sides have agreed to continue their discussion next week
with U.S. mediators present, but the venue would be shifted to the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
It was said the next week's talks will deal with so-called
"interim issues" left over from previous accords, such as creating
a Palestinian port and an airport and a safe passage between the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether they would pursue other issues, which
Albright had hoped to be on the agenda. they were: security
cooperations, further withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West
Bank, a freeze on Jewish settlement constructions and ways of
moving to "final status" negotiations.
</P>
<P>
These issues were said to have been discussed during three
days of talks near Washington, but sources said work on these
issues went very slowly without reaching any agreement.

the United Nations today authorized extension of the mandate of
the Inter-African Mission to Monitor the Implementation of the
Bangui Agreement (MISAB) for three months.
</P>
<P>
In its resolution which was unanimously adopted, the Security
Council approved the continued conduct by member states
participating in the MISAB of the operation in a neutral and

JOHANNESBURG, November 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa has been
accepted as a special member of the African, Caribbean and
Pacific (ACP) trade and economic group, South African Press
Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The special membership implies that South Africa would not
benefit directly from the group's preferential trade and
development aid offered by the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"South Africa does not need European Union trade protection
because its economy is bigger than other ACP countries," said ACP
Secretary-General Peter Magande.
</P>
<P>
Its membership is more of a solidarity or friendship nature.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will have separate trade and aid protocols with
the EU and will pay an annual subscription of 7.32 million
Belgian Francs (about 200,000 U.S. Dollars) to the ACP.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the biggest contributor to the ACP budget," said
Magande.
</P>
<P>
He said South Africa could make special trade arrangements
with the EU, with full support from its ACP counterparts.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki attended an ACP-EU
summit in Libreville, Gabon.
</P>
<P>
The summit was aimed at seeking a continuation of the Lome
Convention, which provides for EU aid to ACP countries and
preferential market entry of ACP products.
The Lome Convention expires in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Ghana's Air Traffic Controllers Still on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The air traffic controllers' strike
for better pay has entered the fifth day and no progress has been made
in the negotiation to settle it.
</P>
<P>
Planes are still flying into the capital Accra which the government
has used the military and others to take over air traffic control.
</P>
<P>
However, there have been fears that the strike could affect other
areas because Ghana is the nerve center of the major air traffic
system covering the west African sub-region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the action of the strikers is causing a friction amongst
other employees for the civil aviation authority, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The workers of other departments in the Ghana Civial Aviation
Authority (GCAA) are threatening to put down their tools if the
authority compromises with the striking air traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
They said the 1,400 dollar per month being demanded by the air
traffic controllers is not reasonable and they do not support their
action.
</P>
<P>
"If the management offers them more money, they have to offer
everyone else more money too," a spokesman for the workers said.
</P>
<P>
GACC has taken on nine air traffic controllers from other west
African countries, including Nigeria, to beef up the contingent of
crew.
</P>
<P>
They are joining those from the air force and from among the
air control management staff who were used as a stop-gap measure
when the airspace was closed by strikers Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Accra flight information region which is controlled from the
Accra tower also has responsibility over neighboring Togo and Benin as
well as 600 nautical miles of airspace over the Atlantic Ocean up to
the Angola marine frontier.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 aircraft use the Accra flight information region
everyday, taking off, landing or flying on route to other
destinations.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Drop on Weak Dow, UK Rate Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
all ended in the negative grounds Thursday, undermined by a
surprise UK interest rate rise and early losses on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The shock announcement of a base rate hike by the Bank of
England today took the City by surprise and kept the FTSE 100
index in London under pressure in afternoon trade.
</P>
<P>
Few experts in the City had been predicting a rate hike until
at least December, largely due to the volatility of equity
markets.
</P>
<P>
Weakness on Wall Street ahead of key US payroll figures added
to the negative tone, with the index ending the day 44.5 points
down at 4,863.8.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt ended 1.11 percent down, with the
DAX-30 index dropping by 42.77 points to 3,823.91 after a day of
thin trading.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank produced no surprises at its fortnightly council
meeting by leaving key interest rates on hold.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that a drop in September German industry orders
and quarter-point rate hike in the UK had little impact on the
market.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, shares also ended lower, with the CAC-40 index down
40.60 points at 2,781.82 by the close of the session as the market
consolidated after Wednesday's 1.7 percent advance.

LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- British police said today they
had smashed a fraud ring involving 800 million dollars in U.S.
treasury bonds and arrested three people.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said the fraud ring was smashed by the City

The operation apparently involved the deposit of fraudulent
U.S. government bonds with a face value of 800 million dollars
into a bank in the City of London.
</P>
<P>
Those arrested, including an American and a Taiwanese
businessman, were being questioned at the Bishopsgate police
station in the City.
</P>
<P>
Police said they recovered fraudulent documents circulating on
the markets.
</P>
<P>
"This has been an extremely successful operation," Detective
Inspector Ken Stewart of the City of London police said.
</P>
<P>
"It is an excellent example of the value of partnerships forged
with law enforcement agencies around the world which assist in
preventing international fraud," Stewart added in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Bush Library Dedicated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Thousands gathered at a
ceremony Thursday to dedicate the George Bush Presidential Library
at Texas A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
Former President George Bush opened his library containing
millions of documents by inviting historians to begin judging
whether he and his administration "got things right or could have
done some things better."
</P>
<P>
"History can make that determination," news reports quoted the
former president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Bush was joined on the occasion by President Clinton and their
predecessors, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford. Former first lady
Nancy Reagan brought wishes on behalf of her husband Ronald, who
is suffering from Alzheimer's Disease.
</P>
<P>
As part of the ceremony, Bush's military career was saluted by
12 Army parachuters, bearing U.S. and Texas flags, who descended
from the sky with a trail of red smoke.
</P>
<P>
The Bush library, with 38 million pages of documents and 1
million photos, is the most heavily computerized of any
presidential library. It took five years to build and was in the
planning stage before Bush left office.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Mercedes-Benz Comes to Egyptian Doorstep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- As common Cairenes struggle
through daily traffic jams, the well-offs can now have their
shining Mercedes barely rolling off the local assembly line.
</P>
<P>
Even at lower prices.
</P>
<P>
This is just one of the many pleasures the wealthy few rush to
enjoy in the industrial zone of October 6 City, 40 kilometers
southwest of Cairo, where a joint venture of German car giant
Daimler-Benz AG and Egyptian National Automobile Trading Co. is
completed.
</P>
<P>
EGA, or the Egyptian German Automotive Co, is officially opened
today. It is one of Egypt's flagship joint ventures with direct
investment from a leading car manufacturer in the world.
</P>
<P>
With a designed annual production capacity of 5,000 cars, the
joint venture, in its initial stage, plans to churn out 2,500
E-200 Mercedes in the first 12 months, Mahkous Schaefel, EGA
marketing manager, told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
As he spoke, a glittering stream of Mercedes were filing out of
the clean workshop into the factory boulevard.
</P>
<P>
A basic model in the new Mercedes-Benz E-class that hit the
road in June 1995, the E-200 took to the fast lane throughout
Europe and soon became an Egyptian favorite.
</P>
<P>
The four-cylinder saloon now accounts for 80 percent of the
1,000 or so Mercedes cars Egypt imports every year.
</P>
<P>
"It is exactly the same German car ... except that it is about
30 percent cheaper," said the German manager. About 60 percent of
the parts are shipped from Daimler-Benz and the rest made in EGA's
60,000-square-meter compound.
</P>
<P>
An E-200 limousine costs 65,000 Deutsch Mark (about 37,830
dollars) in Germany, and 430,000 Egyptian pounds (some 126,000
dollars) if imported. But EGA has whittled down the bill to
290,000 pounds (about 85,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The home-made Mercedes is still costly compared with a
Japanese cars in the local market, but it is getting an amazing
reception here," said Shaefel.
</P>
<P>
Orders have being piling up. In a country where 80 percent of
the 62-million people earn less than 600 U.S. dollars every year,
EGA seems keeping its finger on the pulse of its customers.
</P>
<P>
With investment mounting to 180 million Egyptian pounds (about
53 million dollars), Germans hold 26 percent of the shares of the
joint venture while Egyptians control the rest.
</P>
<P>
It is the second direct investment Daimler-Benz made in the
African continent. The first was a joint venture in South Africa
15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
For the elite few in Egypt, EGA is more than a shot-in-the-arm
to local car industry. Buyers are entitled to a guided tour of the
factory and a close look at cars being manufactured before driving
away in their own brand new, "factory fresh" Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
"If You can afford it, sure you will enjoy it," said a
20-something Egyptian monitoring the paint sector, which boasts
the most modern spray facility for Mercedes cars outside Germany.
</P>
<P>
The government, bent on an economic reform drive since the
early 1980s, apparently made no effort to hide its happiness over
the successful cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Egyptian officials hailed the new
project as a reflection of "the strong commitment and long term
confidence of Daimler-Benz in the dynamic and stable economy of
Egypt."

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Chief Cancels Trip to Freetown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Major-General Victor Malu,
commander of the west African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG), said
today he had to cancel his planned trip to Freetown, Sierra
Leone, on Friday for talks with the military junta.
</P>
<P>
Malu said he had received a message from the junta that they
could not go to the ECOMOG-controlled Lungi area in the suburbs of
Freetown for the meeting for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, scheduled for Friday, is designed to negotiate
over the modalities for the implementation of a peace plan signed
in Conakry, Guinea, under which the junta pledges to hand over
power to the legitimate government it overthrew in the May 25
coup.
</P>
<P>
The junta also informed Malu that they wanted the meeting to
be held in Freetown's city hall next Wednesday, the British
Broadcasting Corporation reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Malu as warning that if the meeting fails,
ECOMOG will consider to resume its air raids against the junta as
a means to force it to go back to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
West African countries have decided a combination of three
measures -- dialogue, sanction and use of force to resolve the
crisis in Sierra Leone following the coup.
</P>
<P>
Economic sanction has been going on and has been beefed up by
a United Nations sanction which was announced by the Security
Council early last month.
</P>
<P>
There has been different opinion among west African leaders
over the use of force to oust the junta although Malu warned his
forces might try the measure.

<HEADLINE> Heathrow Airport Back to Normal After Crash Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Heathrow airport in London was
returning to normal today after an airbus's emergency landing
Wednesday caused lengthy delays.
</P>
<P>
"There will be disruption until early tomorrow morning but
delays will be absolutely minimal," said a spokeswoman for BAA
Plc, the operator of the airport.
</P>
<P>
Heathrow's southern runway, which was closed Wednesday night as
a result of the emergency landing, was blocked until midday.
</P>
<P>
Virgin Atlantic Airbus A340 was forced to an emergency landing
at Heathrow airport after the plane's landing gear failed to
extend. But the crash landing caused no serious injuries to
passengers and only six of the 114 passengers, without much hurt,
were taken to hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
British Airways Plc said it had canceled around 20 flights,
mainly short-haul to other British cities and continental Europe,
because crews and aircraft were in the wrong place. Some cargo
movements were also affected, the airline's cargo division said.
</P>
<P>
Experts from Airbus Industrie and the Anglo-French company
Messier-Dowty, which makes the A340 landing gear, were examining
the equipment, as part of the official accident investigation led
by Britain's Civil Aviation Authority, the source said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright will meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in "the very near future,"
the State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said the time and venue
had not been finalized. But some sources said Albright would meet
with Netanyahu in London and then with Arafat in a site to be
determined on her way to an economic conference in Doha, Qatar,
scheduled late in November.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the aim of the meetings would be to follow up on
work by Israeli and Palestinian negotiators who have just ended
their talks near Washington
</P>
<P>
The three-day Washington talks ended today and both sides
expressed some optimism as there is some progress being made in
so-called "understanding." But they have reached no agreement on
how to end the eight-month stalemate in their peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albright wanted to "divine more clearly what is
necessary to reach agreement on all the issues, particularly those
outlined in the four-part agenda."
</P>
<P>
The four-part agenda, laid down by Albright at the offset of
the Washington talks, include: security cooperation, further
withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West Bank, a freeze on
Jewish settlement constructions and ways of moving to "final
status" negotiations on Palestinian statehood.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: U.S. Still Undecided on Bosnia Beyond Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen today said the U.S. has not made any decision on the
form of an international presence in Bosnia after the current
military mission ends next June.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a breakfast with a group of reporters, Cohen said
there was only a consensus between President Bill Clinton and
Congressional leaders that "some form of international presence
will be required" beyond the deadline.
</P>
<P>
But he added: "There has been no decision made, no consensus
established in terms of what form that international presence
should take, whether the United States would participate and in
what form, be it intelligence, logistics, support or military."
</P>
<P>
His cautious remarks contrasted with a statement by Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright on Wednesday that a consensus was
emerging among U.S. leaders to keep American troops in Bosnia past
the deadline.
</P>
<P>
She said that "a consensus is developing that there will be or
should be some form of U.S. military presence post-SFOR," the
NATO-led Stabilization Force now in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, there is a consensus that we need to do whatever is
necessary to make it work," she added.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it is important for the Europeans to stay and to
continue also in some kind of a military presence, and strengthen
also the police functions there," she stressed.
</P>
<P>
Clinton met his national security advisers and congressional
leaders on Tuesday over what need to be done after the
Stablization Force (SFOR) pulls out of Bosnia next June.
</P>
<P>
Cohen called the meeting "a first step to see whether a
consensus can be developed that will allow some form of
participation by the United States."
</P>
<P>
"There was no consensus reached that evening and I would expect
it would take some time to develop...if it can be developed,"
Cohen stressed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has some 8,000 troops in Bosnia with the SFOR. Early
this year, Clinton vowed to withdraw them by next June.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Reiterates Determination to Defend HK-U.S. Dollar Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), Tung Chee Hwa,
reiterated his determination tonight to defend the link system
between the Hong Kong currency and the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Presentation Ceremony of the 1997 Hong Kong
Awards for Industry, Tung said that Hong Kong has "very sound
economic fundamentals and the outlook is favorable." The SAR's
"economy will continue to benefit from strong growth in the
motherland," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Talking about Hong Kong being an international financial
center," the Chief Executive noted, "I would like to take this
opportunity to reiterate the (SAR) government's tremendous
determination in defending the Hong Kong dollar and maintaining
the Hong Kong-U.S. dollar link."
</P>
<P>
In the opinion of a great number of the SAR officials and
businessmen, the 14-year-old regime of linking the exchange rate
between the two currencies has served Hong Kong well.
</P>
<P>
"We have full ability to do so, given our vast fiscal and
foreign exchange reserves," Tung said, adding: "We can and we will
maintain the link." "I wish to emphasize once again that this is
the fundamental policy and this will not change," he stated.
</P>
<P>
Tung's remarks came amid concerns over whether the SAR
government will give up the currency link system in the face of
the continued fluctuations in the stock market following the
recent financial turmoil here.

<P>
OTTAWA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Hibernia oil megaproject off
Canada's east coast will pump 33 percent more oil a day than
previous thought, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Mobil Oil Canada Ltd., lead partner of the project has revealed
that the oil field's amount of recoverable reserves is much larger
than expected.
</P>
<P>
The Hibernia project is scheduled to produce its first barrel
of oil within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Calgary-based Mobil surprised industry analysts by
announcing that the project will produce 180,000 barrels a day at
its peak, compared with an earlier forecast of 135,000 b/d, the
Globe and Mail newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The company said scientific studies indicate that the Hibernia
field contains at least 750 million barrels of recoverable crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
That's 22 percent higher than its four-year-old estimate of 615
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
Production is expected to average 600,000 b/d next year, hit
135,000 b/d by early 1999 and climb to 180,000 b/d by late 2000.

<HEADLINE> Second Leg of Whitbread To Start on Saturday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The nine yachts still in
the Whitbread Round the World Race have been trimmed and all are
in shipshape condition for Saturday's second leg, starting in Cape
Town, organisers said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ten vessels started the 31,600-mile Whitbread race, which has
attracted some of the best yachtsmen in the world, from Cowes,
England, on September 21.
</P>
<P>
Paul Cayard's Swedish yacht EF Language won the 7,350 mile
first leg in a time of 30 days, 16 hours, 54 minutes and 26
seconds on October 21.
</P>
<P>
Monaco yacht Merit Cup and Norwegian vessel Innovation Kvaerner
came behinD with a time of 31:12:20.00 and 31:14:09.00
respectively.
</P>
<P>
America's Challenge, a US entry which was lying seventh,
withdrew from the race soon after arriving in Cape Town because of
financial problems.
</P>
<P>
From the start in Table Bay, the fleet will head down the
coast, passing the Cape of Good Hope and then dive deep into the
Southern Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The 4,600-mile leg is the toughest of the nine, traversing the
most inhospitable stretch of ocean in the world as they head for
Freemantle, Western Australia.
</P>
<P>
After Australia and New Zealand, the entrants head home via
Cape Horn, Brazil, the east coast of the United States and across
the Atlantic to Brittany.
</P>
<P>
The race will only finish next May with a final sprint -- a
mere 450 miles from La Rochelle back to Southampton.

<HEADLINE> Britain Develops Easy Diagnosis for Heart Failure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have
developed a simple, inexpensive blood test to give early warning
of heart failure in patients with minor symptoms.
</P>
<P>
The medical journal, The Lancet, reported that the test
isolates hormones known as natriuretic peptides which help to
reduce fluid retention which occurs when the heart when it fails.
</P>
<P>
During heart failure, the hormones cause the kidney to filter
out salt, and blood vessels to dilate.
</P>
<P>
At its onset, heart failure can be hard to distinguish from
common illnesses such as lung diseases, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the National Heart and Lung Institute at
Hillingdon Hospital in London carried out examinations on 122
patients who were diagnosed by other doctors as heart failure
cases.
</P>
<P>
They found only 35 were suffering from heart failure. Blood
tests on them showed that they had an unusually high concentration
of the peptide.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Ease Amid Large Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices fell
slightly in sales across three states this week, holding up well
despite the large quantity of bales on offer, industry analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark eastern market indicator fell seven Australian
cents to 706 Australian cents (492 US cents) a kilogram, compared
with last week's close.
</P>
<P>
In its wool market review, the Australian Council of Wool
Exporters (ACWE) said a total of 105,892 bales were offered at
sales in Adelaide, Sydney and Fremantle.
</P>
<P>
"With the market remaining firm on the last day of selling
after falls earlier in the week, exporters felt that it held up as
well as could be expected, given the relatively large quantity on
offer and similarity of types in the Adelaide section," ACWE said.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian dollar, though somewhat volatile as has to be
expected in the current global circumstances, remains a positive
element in what continues to be a fairly fragile market," it said.
</P>
<P>
Wesfarmers Dalgety said the outlook remained firm despite this
week's fall in prices.
</P>
<P>
The lower dollar and the large quantity of wool for sale
beginning to dwindle towards the end of the month should influence
sales, Wesfarmers Dalgety said in its Wool Weekly newsletter.
</P>
<P>
"A combination of these factors may place some buyers in a
supply squeeze situation and support the expected outlook for
prices to remain firm next week," the newsletter said.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Confirms Einstein's Theory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A bizarre distortion of space
and time predicted by Albert Einstein's theory of relativity has
been proved after 80 years, The Times reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Observations from a satellite launched in 1995 have shown that
rotating black holes drag space and time around with them as they
spin, like a tornado picking up debris in their paths.
</P>
<P>
Two teams reported the discovery of "frame-dragging", as the
process is called, at a meeting of the American Astronomical
Society in Estes Park, Colorado, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The results are a further confirmation that Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity, published in 1915, made an accurate
prediction about how nature behaves.
</P>
<P>
According to the theory, all rotating bodies generate a new
kind of gravitational force, the gravitomagnetic force, by virtue
of their rotation.
</P>
<P>
Detecting the effect for bodies such as the Earth, which is
neither very massive nor rotates very fast, is difficult. Black
holes or neutron stars pack a huge amount of mass into a
comparatively tiny space and rotate very fast, making them the
perfect places to look for frame-dragging.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, an Italian team reported success after
looking at neutron stars, and an American team confirmed it by
looking at black holes. Both used instruments on board the Rossi
X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE), a satellite launched by the
U.S. space agency NASA.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Lift Ban on Cooked Chicken Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Australia would lift its ban
on imports of cooked chicken meat after international experts
found no health risks were involved, Primary Industries Minister
John Anderson said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service (AQIS) would also
permit imports of uncooked pork from Denmark, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
He said while cooked chicken would be permitted from Denmark
and the United States, and further assessments were being made of
an application by Thailand, substantial imports were unlikely.
</P>
<P>
Chicken growers welcomed tougher controls on imports, but the
pork industry slammed the announcement, saying Denmark's
successful application would pave the way for the United States to
enter the local market.
</P>
<P>
Anderson said under more stringent cooking requirements, meat
must be cooked at a minimum of 70 degrees Celsius for 143 minutes,
with international experts finding little disease risk as a
result.
</P>
<P>
Australia had to open its markets in order to gain reciprocal
entry overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government would set up a seven million US dollar industry
adjustment package for the pork industry out of recognition of the
challenges it faced, Anderson said.

<P>
CANBERRA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar remained
depressed today, weighed down by concerns that Australia could be
swept up in the economic turmoil engulfing Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar drifted lower throughout the local
session before pulling up slightly to close at 69.79 US cents,
steady with yesterday's close but down from 69.84 at the open.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the market was still digesting Reserve Bank of
Australia Governor Ian Macfarlane's semi-annual testimony to a
parliamentary committee here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Macquarie Bank foreign exchange manager Mark O'Leary said while
Macfarlane highlighted some positives for the Australian economy
to come out of the Asia crisis, the downside remained.
</P>
<P>
"The Asian fallout is going to hurt a lot of people," O'Leary
said.
</P>
<P>
Macfarlane told the committee yesterday that in contrast to the
Southeast Asian economic turmoil, Australia could be an attractive
place to do business.
</P>

Against the yen, the local unit ended at 86.35, from 85.70
previously, and at 1.2001 marks, from 1.1989.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng Stresses Importance of Resettlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YICHANG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
urged governments at all levels to continue to attach importance
to the resettlement of the people in Three Gorges area starting
1998.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting on resettlement, which opened here today,
the premier described the resettlement as an important task for
the construction of the mammoth Three Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
"The general task for the second-phase resettlement is to
ensure that the Three Gorges reservoir reach a water level of 135
m by 2003," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that some 95,000 people have been displaced in the
reservoir area since 1993, he said that the second phase is
expected to involve the relocation of 400,000 people, averaging
close to 80,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing the importance of resettlement work, the premier
pointed out, the central authorities have promulgated a series of
policies and measures.
</P>
<P>
The policies and measures include launching
development-oriented resettlement programs, keeping the pace of
resettlement in tandem with that of construction of the project,
establishing Chongqing Municipality to enhance leadership over
resettlement; granting preferential policies to reservoir areas;
and relocating people within the area of their original counties,
or villages if possible.
</P>
<P>
"The key to the success of the Three Gorges project lies in
resettlement, and the key of resettlement lies in leadership," the
premier emphasized, adding that the relation between the state,
local authorities and displaced people, as well as that between
resettlement and development, must be tackled properly.
</P>
<P>
He called for efforts to enhance management of relocation
programs, especially that of fund to "stop it from being drained
on, diverted to other use, or squandered", as well as enhanced
education of cadres and supervision and management over use of
funds by discipline inspection and auditing departments at all
levels.
</P>
<P>
"The builders and officials of the reservoir area at all levels
must always bear in mind that the funds for the construction of
the Three Gorges project come from the whole nation, and
squandering of the fund is under no circumstances permitted," the
premier said.
</P>
<P>
However, he called on departments at the central level, as well
as provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions to continue to
render support to resettlement work.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng also addressed other issues including the development
of environment-friendly farming geared to the market and supported
by science and technology, environment protection in the reservoir
area and preservation of cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
On tomorrow's blocking of the Yangtze river, he cited it as an
exciting event to show to the whole world the great achievements
of China and the capability of its people to construct the largest
hydropower project.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was attended by Ding Guangen, Luo Gan, Zou
Jiahua, Chen Junsheng as well as officials from Hubei and
Sichuan provinces and Chongqing Municipality and other parts of
the country.

<HEADLINE> DNA Tests Unravel Mummy's Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have diagnosed the
disease suffered by an ancient mummy by DNA for the first time,
The Times reported here today.
</P>
<P>
An Egyptian nobleman who died more than 3,000 years ago was
found to have suffered from tuberculosis, the DNA tests revealed.
</P>
<P>
Though accurate examination was hampered by problems posed by
contamination of ancient tissue, the DNA tests found tuberculosis
was present in the left lung.
</P>
<P>
The earliest proven trace of the disease before this was in a
Peruvian mummy dating from between AD 1000 and 1300, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The mummy tested this time was found in the tombs of the nobles
at Thebes-West in Upper Egypt by the German Institute of
Archeology in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
"A carefully controlled analysis of ancient Egyptian mummies
may provide insights into infectious diseases of ancient
individuals and populations," researchers said.

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi
said here today his team is satisfied with the atmosphere during
the discussions in Iraq, but apparently short of obtaining a
Baghdad assurance to comply with U.N. mandates.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Ibrahimi said the discussion
between his team and Iraqi officials were conducted in "good
atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
He said his team will convey a letter from the Iraqi leadership
to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan immediately back in New York
and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz will go to the Security
Council in the coming days to voice Iraqi concerns and grievances.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoys shied away from making comments on the results
of the U.N. team's talks with Iraqi officials but said it has
clearly carried out the mission entrusted by the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, the U.N. envoys, under the
instruction of the secretary general, held four rounds of
discussions with the Iraqi side and conveyed "what the reaction of
the Security Council members to Iraqi decision on October 29."
</P>
<P>
They delivered a letter from the secretary general asking
Baghdad to go back to the status quo before October 29 and revoke
its decision to expel U.S. weapon inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided to ban U.S. weapon inspectors from joining
U.N. inspection, in reaction to a U.N. threat with further
sanctions if Baghdad continued to tamper with weapon inspection
missions.
</P>
<P>
The three-men U.N. delegation listened to Iraqi concerns and
grievances with "respect, patience and interest," and will report
Iraqi requests to the Security Council, according to Ibrahimi.
</P>
<P>
And Iraq has agreed to suspend the execution of its decision to
expel the U.S. personnel with the U.N. inspection mission.

<HEADLINE> Bank Seat Overshadows Anglo-French Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair and French President Jacques Chirac will discuss the single
European currency and other shared concerns at the annual
Anglo-French summit to be held here today.
</P>
<P>
However, French opposition to the proposal to reserve a seat
for London at the future European Central Bank has cast a shadow
over the summit.
</P>
<P>
At a pre-summit working dinner with Chirac and French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin Thursday, Blair reportedly inquired about
the possibility of getting a seat on the central bank's executive
board even though Britain has ruled out its first-wave membership
of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
French government sources were quoted by the Financial Times
newspaper as saying that Chirac and Jospin seemed reluctant to
accept the proposal.
</P>
<P>
French Finance Minister Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is
accompanying Chirac, said the French government believed it hard
to imagine giving seats on the European Central Bank to countries
that had not joined the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
The two sides are expected to discuss the French truckers'
strike, which is blocking millions of pounds worth of British
exports to Continental countries.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Freight Transport Association complained that the
strike was costing the British transport industry an estimated one
million pounds (about 1.7 million U.S. dollars) each day.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also due to sign an agreement on
strengthening cooperation between their armed forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada's jobless rate in October
rose 0.1 percentage points to 9.1 percent, Statistics Canada
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's employment was virtually unchanged while
unemployment rose by an estimated 24,000, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The number of working youths edged down slightly in the
month. The youth unemployment rate fell slightly to 16.3 percent
as a result of a drop in the number of young people out seeking
jobs.
</P>
<P>
In October, an increase in part-time employment offset a drop
in full-time work, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
It added that despite recent fluctuations, both full and
part-time employment grew by about 2 percent since February.
</P>
<P>
In October, employment in the goods-producing sector rose by
7,000, while employment in mining, forestry and fishing fell by
15,000.
</P>
<P>
There was little change in the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
In the service sector, employment fell 31,000 in health and
social services while there were small increases in trade,
business and personal services.

<HEADLINE> 25 Entrepreneurs Honored for Poverty-Relief Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Association for the
Promotion of the Glorious Cause, a non-governmental anti-poverty
organization, today presented medals to 25 people who have made
outstanding contributions to the country's efforts to help the
poor.
</P>
<P>
The 25 are entrepreneurs from the private economic sector and
from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao regions. They actively
participated in alleviating poverty through investing and
establishing factories in central and western areas of China since
the association began operation in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, met here
today with the association's representatives and extended his
congratulations to the medal winners.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also chairman of the National Committee of Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, said the report of the
Party's 15th National Congress stressed the importance of the
non-public economy as a component of China's socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
"This means non-public ownership will not only exist but will
keep developing steadily and soundly as long as China is in the
primary stage of socialism," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging some people to get rich first is a way to common
prosperity, he said. "If we didn't allow some people to get rich
first, the result would have only been shared poverty."
</P>
<P>
Li said it is impossible to make everyone rich in a short
time. Therefore, people who have become rich should use their
talents and resources to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
"The glorious cause is an effective way for the rich to help
the poor. It is the continuation of traditional Chinese virtues of
helping the poor and needy," Li said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that more people from the private sector
would participate in the glorious cause and encouraged government
support at all levels.
</P>
<P>
Over the last three years, about 3,200 people from China's
inland areas and Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao region have donated
386 million yuan and invested 5.16 billion yuan in more than 2,700
projects which have helped lift 540,000 people out of poverty,
according to association sources.

<HEADLINE> Russia Keen to Strengthen Ties With China: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today said that his scheduled visit to China on Sunday is mainly
aimed at strengthening the bilateral relationship and exploring
new fields of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the remark during a joint interview with China's
Xinhua news agency and People's Daily, one of China's most
influential newspapers.
</P>
<P>
He said the notion that China and Russia share a
21st-century-oriented strategic partnership of equality and mutual
respect reflects not only the current situation, but also
prospects of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
To develop good-neighborly cooperation with China is one of the
priorities of Russia's foreign policy, and that is a long-term
strategic policy which will not be changed under changing
political factors, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the governments of China and Russia face
the same task of carrying out reform and bringing a powerful and
prosperous economy into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Recalling the development of bilateral friendship over the past
five years, Yeltsin said the border shared by the two countries is
now a border of peace and cooperation, and the regular meeting
mechanism between deputy prime ministers of the two countries
enjoys smooth operation.
</P>
<P>
As for trade and economic cooperation, Yeltsin said there still
exists potential waiting to be brought into full play. Weak
economic ties cannot adapt to the two countries' close political
relations, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He urged a transition of trade cooperation from simple
commodity exchanges to mutual investment.
</P>
<P>
Infrastructure designed to help promote economic cooperation,
such as commercial information systems and mechanisms to solve
business disputes, should be established as soon as possible,
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the two countries join efforts to
complete some large-scaled projects in the energy, power and
transportation industries.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China-Russia trade should be operated under the
market principle, Yeltsin also pointed out that the two
governments have responsibilities to create favorable conditions
for more business contacts.
</P>
<P>
In another interview with the Itar-Tass news agency, Yeltsin
said a major statement on the demarcation along both the eastern
and the western sectors of the border shared by the two countries
was to be declared during his China tour.
</P>
<P>
Peace along border was crucial not only for the development of
bilateral friendship but also for safeguarding regional peace.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said he was looking forward to every meeting with
Jiang.

<HEADLINE> French Truckers Split Over Compromise Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- French unions are divided over a
compromise package presented Thursday by employers of the trucking
industry, although the biggest union of the striking lorry
drivers, Confederation Francaise Democratique du Travail (CFDT),
has accepted the compromise.
</P>
<P>
In marathon negotiations which lasted from Wednesday until
early today, the biggest organization of trucking industry
employers, the Union of Federations of Transport (UFT), agreed to
raise the monthly salary for 200 working hours to 10,000 francs
(1,666 U.S. dollars) by the year 2,000, and to guarantee minimum
monthly wages for truckers.
</P>
<P>
The CFDT said today that the offer of UFT read well because it
responded to two principal demands by the unions.
</P>
<P>
Some militants of CFDT, which represents 80 percent of the
striking lorry drivers, began to lift highway barriers erected
since Monday, while militants of other unions, including the Force
Ouvriere (FO) and Confederation Generale du Travail (CGT), refused
to lift their blockades.
</P>
<P>
A major blockade which jammed 300 lorries since Thursday night
south of Lyon, was lifted this morning by CFDT militants, after
three lorries were sabotaged by non-striking truckers.
</P>
<P>
Members of CFDT also lifted barriers on the highway linking
Paris with the northern city of Lille, and CFDT strikers in
Bas-Rhin at the Franco-German border and those in Besancon also
voted to accept the UFT compromise offer.
</P>
<P>
But the national highway information center (CNIR) said this
morning that there were still about 150 barriers on highways
across France.
</P>
<P>
FO militants again blocked an oil storage center in Frontignau,
as Roger Poletti, the FO representative who participated in talks
at the Ministry of Transport, said he could not accept the UFT
protocol because it failed to meet the expectation of workers. He
asked militants to keep the barriers.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of two other unions, the independent FNCR and
the Confederation Francaise des Travailleurs Chretiens (CFTC),
also said they would not sign the offer.
</P>
<P>
In Haute-Normandie, 32 barriers remained on the highways this
morning and about 500 trucks were stranded there as CFDT leaders
consulted their strikers about the UFT offer, which was open for
signing this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Militants of the FO and CGT in the Bouches-du-Rhone region,
where the southern cosmopolitan of Marseille is located, voted
against the protocol this morning, while two oil storage centers
in Toulouse remained blocked by truckers of the CFDT, FO and CGT.

<HEADLINE> Terrorist Gang Network Dismantled in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian police said
it had finally dismantled a tightly-knit network of terrorists
that had been operating in selected areas of the country and
rounded up both leaders and collaborators.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Ethiopian Herald, a statement issued by
the Ethiopian police said the well-armed terrorists frequented
recreation and resort areas in urban centers and also ventured
elsewhere to create panic among peaceful civilian people.
</P>
<P>
This group, it said, was responsible for throwing
hand-grenades at Belaineh Hotel in Harar, Tigray Hotel and Blue
Tops Restaurant in Addis Ababa as well as the death and injury of
a number of innocent people.
</P>
<P>
The statement named three terrorists as Rabi Husien Yosuf, the
leader, and Gadissa Abera and Ashenafi Biru, members of a special
unit that was deployed in towns to lead and coordinate terrorist
operations.
</P>
<P>
The statement pointed out that these terrorists used to be
members of the outlined Oromo Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian police in cooperation with other law
enforcement organs have been able to run down the ring leaders of
the terrorist group along with their accomplices and
collaborators," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On February 10 of this year, a hand-grenade explosion at
Belaineh Hotel in Harar, a border town near Somalia, killed two
persons and injured nine others. On April 12 of this year, two
hand-grenade blasts broke out almost simultaneously in the
evening at Tigray Hotel and Blue Tops Restaurant in Addis Ababa,
killing one people and injuring 42 others.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Against Resuming U-2 Flights Over Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has expressed regret for
the insistence of Richard Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special
Commission, on ordering the American U-2 spy plane to overfly
Iraqi territory again.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi news agency today quotes a message of Iraqi
government to the Commission chairman as saying that Iraq will
hold Butler responsible of the consequences of his order to resume
U-2 flights in Iraqi air space in the present circumstances when
the U.S. is planning a military aggression against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Commission chairman informed the Iraqi mission
to the U.N. on November 5 of the resumption of U-2 flights next
week without fixing any dates for such flights.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iraqi message, Butler has communicated to the
Iraqi U.N. mission that the U-2 aircraft will resume overflying
Iraqi territory, at a time when dialogue is under way between Iraq
and the U.N. Secretary General's team in Baghdad, and despite
Secretary General Kofi Annan's request for self restraint.
</P>
<P>
Iraq had earlier called upon the Commission to replace the
American U-2 spy aircraft with an Iraqi plane that would be placed
at the Commission's disposal or with another aircraft from any
neutral country should the need for such aircraft still existed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz, addressing a news
conference here today, accused the U.S. of using the U-2 aircraft for
spying rather than serving the purposes of the U.N. Special
Commission. He also said that the U.S. had used the pictures taken
by this aircraft in hitting Iraq targets in 1993 and in 1996.

<HEADLINE> San Francisco Clean Sweep by a "Great Sweep" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
officials and ordinary residents in San Francisco are expected to
make a thoroughly "clean sweep" of the city this Saturday in
response to their mayor's call.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Willie Brown has invited his 778,000 constituents to come
out and help sweep every block of the city.
</P>
<P>
In his state of the city speech last month, Brown told his
audience: "The city doesn't get dirty itself. This stuff (rubbish)
doesn't get legs. It doesn't get out there itself."
</P>
<P>
He said the "Great Sweep" may pick up and cart off 300 tons of
loose trash and people may get into the habit of feeling
responsible for their streets.
</P>
<P>
In planning for the mayor's first Great Sweep, which he wants
to make into a semiannual event, the city has been divided into 10
districts and then subdivided into 88 staging areas. Volunteers
are expected to sweep every block of every street in the
city. Parks, school yards and public housing areas will also be
swept.
</P>
<P>
Top city officials, including department heads, elected city
officials and members of the Board of Supervisors, are expected to
take the lead. They will wield brooms and dustpans along with
ordinary residents.
</P>
<P>
Specific plans for the cleanup have been made by the city's
public works department.
</P>
<P>
Those who volunteer to take part in the activity will get free
trash bags, brooms and other cleaning tools. They will be told to
sweep the sidewalks in front of their homes, or join in cleaning
tough spots.

<HEADLINE> Former Australian PMs Repudiate Hanson's Views on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Australia's former prime
ministers Bob Hawke, Paul Keating and Gough Whitlam today urged
Australians to join them in their fight against racism in order to
safeguard their future economic and social well-being.
</P>
<P>
In a public letter issued today, the three former leaders
compared independent MP Pauline Hanson's views on Aborigines to
Nazi Germany's depiction of Jews as a sub-human species, and
described fast-growing Asia as vital to the future of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Whitlam had been prime minister during 1972 and 1975. Hawke
served as prime minister during 1983 and 1991, and his successor
Keating held the position until 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Hanson's allegations of Aboriginal cannibalism carried an awful
resonance of the depiction in Nazi Germany of Jews as sub-human
species," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"Let us put the moral position first and unequivocally: In the
eyes of the Gods of the world's great religions there is no
prejudice of color or race nor should there be in the eyes of men
or women. No person on this earth is intrinsically of greater or
lesser merit because of their color or race," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
After her election as an MP last March, Hanson once described
the Australian Aboriginal people as cannibal and declared the
underprivileged Aborigines of 300,000 deserve no government
assistance.
</P>
<P>
The letter sought to remind Australians of the significance of
Asia to the future of Australia and called Hanson's position on
Asians "morally repugnant and directly against the interests of
this and succeeding generations of Australians."
</P>
<P>
"More than 60 percent of our exports go there (Asia). Our
tourism industry offers greater opportunities for employment
growth than any other. Asians have been the most rapidly growing
component and now comprise more than 50 percent of overseas
visitors. Income from the education of Asian students in Australia
has become a significant factor in our earnings of foreign
exchange," the letter said.

TIRANA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will
provide 17 million ECU (20 million U.S. dollars) to help Albania
complete its first expressway, the Voice of the People newspaper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The money will help build 34 kilometers of the highway running
from the capital of Tirana to the western coastal city of
Durres. Five kilometers of the highway have been built.
</P>
<P>
The EU has planned to provide Albania with 57 million ECU in
1997, 70 percent to be used in building infrastructure of the
country including the expressway.
</P>
<P>
The expressway could go into operation by the end of 1999 but
the completion time depends on the work tenders, a report quoted
an EU official as saying.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Internet Opens up New Realm in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Africa, a continent which is
often seen as the last frontier for information technology, is
now forging ahead by getting itself wired up on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
For Africa, a continent with the least developed telecom
infrastructure, Internet service has undoubtedly offered a
"jump-start" opportunity to narrow its gap with the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Currently 47 of the 54 countries in Africa have developed some
form of Internet access -- either a local dial-up store and
forward E-mail service with a gateway to the Internet, or a full
leased line service, according to Michael Jensen, "father of
Internet in Africa" who has been engaged in this field in 29
African countries over the last 11 years.
</P>
<P>
Of these, he added, 42 countries and territories have achieved
live Internet public access service in their capital cities.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it is no longer surprising to see name cards or
newspaper advertisements being added with E-mail addresses to the
time-honored postal and physical addresses.
</P>
<P>
This telecommunications marvel has just started to infiltrate
into various sectors of the African economy.
</P>
<P>
Since Tanzania has placed its tourism attractions on the
Internet, the Sukuma Museum in the country has become the first
museum in east Africa, and probably in the entire sub-Saharan
region to offer visitors virtual tours via the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, manufacturers seeking to export to the Common Market
for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) member countries may
soon benefit from a new computer service by making use of an
E-mail system that functions via the local area network.
</P>
<P>
In Namibia, the Ministry of Environment and Tourism has
invested in an on-line booking system, which will enable customer
queries and reservations to be processed in minutes.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, the "technology-hungry country" with the most
advanced telecommunications network on the continent, is even
providing services like Internet banking in the country, which is
well ahead of the information-rich United States, according to
Amolo Ng'weno, an executive from AfricaOnline, a multi-national
Internet provider headquartered in S. Africa.

BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li Lanqing
said today that Russian President Boris Yeltsin's third
forthcoming visit to China is a "very important one" and China
attaches great importance to the visit.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in an interview here today with Russian
correspondents based in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Li said that frequent contacts between leaders of China and
Russia, two big neighbors and both permanent members of the UN
Security Council, are of very important significance to the
enhancement of bilateral ties and the healthy growth of
international relations.
</P>
<P>
China is satisfied with the smooth development of Sino-Russian
ties in various fields, the vice-premier told the Russian
reporters.
</P>
<P>
China and Russia are economically complementary and there
exists tremendous potential for bilateral cooperation, Li said,
adding that China hopes to boost the mutually beneficial
cooperation in the areas of economy, trade, energy, science and
technology through the joint efforts of both sides.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the forthcoming summit between
President Jiang Zemin and President Yeltsin, the fifth between the
two heads of state, would help promote the all-round development
of Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership and bring the
bilateral economic and trade cooperation to a new stage.
</P>
<P>
Li also answered the reporters' questions about the
Sino-Russian relations and the economic and trade cooperation
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Kharrazi Starts First Trip to Arab Neighbors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi left here today for Damascus to begin a visit to Syria
and six Gulf kingdoms in a bid to improve relations with them.
</P>
<P>
This is Kharrazi's visit trip in the Gulf region in the current
capacity which is regarded here as a very important step taken by
the new government of President Mohammad Khatami to break the
decade-old isolation and counter U.S. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Kharrazi said the priority of Iran's foreign
policies is to expand relations with its neighbors, particularly
the Persian Gulf states, according to Tehran Radio.
</P>
<P>
The visit is expected to focus on strengthening trust and
confidence between Iran and the six Gulf states - Oman, Qatar,
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi hoped it will create new conditions for Iran to
promote relations and explore ways for economic cooperation with
the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also expected the visit will exert positive effect on
peace and stability in the region. With increased trust and
confidence among regional countries, there would be no need for
the presence of foreign forces in the region, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Kharrazi would deliver messages of Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami to the rulers of those Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
He will also try to persuade the those leaders to attend the
forthcoming summit in Tehran of the Organization of Islamic
Conference (OIC), and explain Iran's foreign policies,
particularly on regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Iran and most of the Gulf Arab states cooled
down after Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979 and the coming to
power of hardline clergymen. Some Arab countries regard Iran as a
threat to regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Tehran has since repeated its willingness to seek close
friendly relations and cooperation with neighboring countries,
particularly the Gulf states.

NAIROBI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Ng'weno, who is based in
Nairobi, Kenya, said there are 150 to 200 Internet service
providers in Africa, of which 70 are stationed in S. Africa.
</P>
<P>
AfricaOnline, the premier Internet company in Kenya founded in
1994, now has approximately 6,000 subscribers, 95 percent of
which are small and medium-sized businesses in the country. In
Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania and Zimbabwe, the company has
another 6,000 users to its services. And the number is still
increasing by 10 percent a month.
</P>
<P>
"The nice things about the service," said Ng'weno, "are that
businesses see an immediate return both in reduced communication
cost and in finding things they need. It's very exciting to see
people interacting internationally and easily."
</P>
<P>
The picture in South Africa is much brighter than in the rest
of the continent. It is estimated that the number of South
Africans on line was about 500,000 in September, and could reach
one million by the end of this year. The country now ranks 14th
in the world concerning domain names, leaving behind some
developed countries such as New Zealand, Denmark and Austria.
</P>
<P>
A recent study by International Data Corporation shows that 71
percent of South Africa's top 200 organizations have set up a web
server or are planning to do so.
</P>
<P>
What is more, on-line advertising is the largest component of
Internet electronic commerce. By the end of the century, the
South African Internet site development and advertising market
could be worth one billion Rand (222 million U.S. dollars) with
more than two million Rand (about 444,000 US dollars) of on-line
transactions a year, noted Robin Parker, a Web publisher.
</P>
<P>
No wonder studies by the Geneva-based International
Telecommunications Union (ITU) and the World Bank indicate a
direct link between efficient telecommunications and economic
growth.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Starts Monitoring El Nino-Related Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
directed hospitals nationwide to start monitoring possible
increase of El Nino phenomenon-related diseases, such as diarrhea,
the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Health Secretary Carmencita Reodica also ordered the
country's health offices to allot funds in anticipation of the
increase of any diseases due to the El Nino phenomenon which is
expected to hit the country at the end of this year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The health chief asked the public to observe proper
environmental sanitation and food preparations and to ensure
safety of their drinking water amid possible scarcity of water.
</P>
<P>
She warned earlier that El Nino can trigger many diseases,
including diarrhea, skin infections and other illness related to
water scarcity.
</P>
<P>
Particularly vulnerable to these diseases are the very young
and the elderly, specifically those in the crowded urban slum
areas, she stressed.
</P>
<P>
"With or without the El Nino phenomenon, we have cases of these
diseases, but the monitoring will tell us its health effect, the
extent, the particular sites and for prompt actions," she said.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino phenomenon is a warm ocean current that appears
every three to six years in Eastern Pacific ocean and affects
climate and weather patterns over wide areas of the globe.
</P>
<P>
It is characterized by extreme climatic conditions such as
extreme temperature rise, little rainfall and at the opposite
extreme, unusual heavy rainfall.

NAIROBI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- However, on-line advertising
has only a minimal impact in Africa, with a possible total of no
more than 20,000 dollars a month on popular web sites, said
Arthur Goldstuck, an expert on Internet business, adding that 90
percent of this spending is probably taking place in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Commercial transactions, which now focus mainly on travel,
books &AMP; magazines, records &AMP; CDs, cars and property &AMP; real
estates, still need a long time to take off.
</P>
<P>
Internet, which takes a phone line and a computer unit for a
user to cruise down the world information superhighway, has
confronted some major obstacles in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Africa still has the slowest growth in the number of telephone
lines per 100 people compared with the rest of the world.
Sub-Saharan Africa has an average of 0.48 telephone lines per 100
people. Yet the number of people waiting for a phone line is
reported to be growing at 7 percent annually.
</P>
<P>
With 12 percent of the world's population, Africa has only two
percent of the world's telephones, while Latin America has six
percent of the lines and eight percent of the world's population
and Asia, 13 percent of the lines with 57 percent of the world's
population.
</P>
<P>
The ITU estimated that it would cost over 28 billion U.S.
dollars to increase sub-Saharan teledensity levels to one line
per 100 people by the year 2000. Since individual nations can not
meet the cost, it is suggested that the example of Ivory Coast
and Ghana be followed, which is to inject private capital
combined with a relaxation of regulatory environments.
</P>
<P>
It is encouraging to note that some African countries have
made telecommunications a priority and are installing digital
switches with fiber optic inter-city backbones and newest
cellular and mobile technology.
</P>
<P>
These would consequently give a great impetus to net service
on the continent.
</P>
<P>
"Internet business is nothing now (in Africa), but it's
growing quickly," said Ng'weno, adding that "It's a business that
can only grow."

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Commemorates October Revolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam today commemorated the
80th anniversary of the Russian October Revolution, calling it
"the biggest event of the 20th century", and vowing to continue
gaining inspiration from the revolution in building socialism.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV) newspaper, Nhan Dan, run
an editorial saying the success of the revolution shook the whole
world and the rule of imperialism. It paved the way for the
world's revolutionary and national liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the October Revolution opened the way for
the success of a series of revolutions across the world. The
Soviet Union and China were major forces contributing to defeating
fascism and militarism and suffered the greatest losses.
</P>
<P>
"Though having committed many mistakes, the socialist system
was a global power for many decades, the bulwark of the world
revolution movement, and a force to restrain imperialism's
ambition to dominate the world," the editorial added.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Nguyen Duc Binh, member of the Political Bureau of
the CPV, gave a report at a seminar marking the October Revolution.
</P>
<P>
The revolution gave birth to a new style of state and a new
society that existed for half of a century with resounding
victories and achievements, he said.
</P>
<P>
Binh said: "The great Russian October Revolution would always
light the way for Vietnam's revolution."
</P>
<P>
"To celebrate the 80th anniversary of the revolution, the
entire party and people are advancing towards the 21st century
with firm confidence in Marxism-Leninism and Ho Chi Minh's
thought," he said.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Prepared for El Nino: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos today

onslaught of the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Addressing participants of the ongoing Asia-Pacific Clean Up

Palace, Ramos said the government has put in place various
mechanisms to soften the adverse impacts of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
"We are now in what is expected to be the critical months,
November and December, when some of our provinces will not have
enough rainfall." he said.

He said the government will do its best to ensure the long-term
and short-term action agendas drawn up during the meetings be
fully implemented.

<HEADLINE> Lancang River to be Temporarily Dammed on Nov. 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Lancang River, or the upper
reaches of Mekong River, will be temporarily cut off to make way
for construction of a hydropower station on the morning of
November 10.
</P>
<P>
Information from the construction headquarters of the
Dachaoshan Hydro-Electric Power Station on the Lancang River
confirmed that all preparatory work is finished for the damming of
the river.
</P>
<P>
By November 6, the main gap between the cofferdams had been
narrowed to below 50 meters. Starting from today, construction
workers will stop work for two days, then resume on November 9 and
block the river the next day.
</P>
<P>
Dachaoshan Station is the second hydro-electric power station
on the middle reaches of the Lancang River. The first, the Manwan
Hydro-Electric Power Station, is located at the upstream area of
the Dachaoshan Reservoir.
</P>
<P>
As the Manwan Station at the upstream controls the water, the
water flow near the cofferdams for Dachaoshan Station is
comparatively stable, which allows construction workers to
continue their work according to schedule.
</P>
<P>
However, an official in charge of the damming work said that it
was quite possible that the water in the upper reaches will rise
in the forthcoming days, so technicians have been closely watching
this situation and necessary preparations have been made to
counteract any possible changes.
</P>
<P>
Dachaoshan Hydro-Electric Power Station will have an installed
generating capacity of 1.35 million kw and will cost about 8.87
billion yuan. It will be able to generate more than 5.9 billion
kwh of electricity when completed.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong flows through China, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar,
Vietnam and Thailand, with more than 1,000 km running in Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government has planned to construct 14
hydro-electric power stations on the upper reaches, or Lancang of
the Mekong, and the total installed capacity will exceed 20
million kw.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Dachaoshan Hydro-Electric Power Station
will help alleviate power shortages in southwest China in the next
century and advance the development of the remaining 12
hydro-electric power stations.

JOHANNESBURG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- There was a possibility
that the bank rate could be reduced again before the budget in
March next year, South African Press Association quoted Reserve
Bank Governor Chris Stals as saying today.
</P>
<P>
Recent market developments would help curb bank credit
extension, making it easier to bring interest rate down, Stals
told journalists.
</P>
<P>
He said he was happy with the current exchange rate of the
Rand as compared with the basket of other currencies. He did not
have a view on the Rand's performance against the U.S. dollar,
which he said was fluctuating against other currencies.

<HEADLINE> International Bamboo-Rattan Trade Group Founded in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The first China-based
international inter-governmental organization -- the International
Network for Bamboo and Rattan (INBAR) -- was established here
today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing today's ceremony, Vice Premier Jiang Chunyun said
the Chinese government will provide full support to the new
organization to ensure its smooth operation.
</P>
<P>
Gordon S. Smith from Canada will be the first chairman of the
INBAR board. Jiang Zehui, president of the China Academy of
Forestry Science, will be co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
"INBAR is a non-profit, independent international
research-and-development institution with a full legal status,"
Jiang said after the official opening.
</P>
<P>
According to Vice-Premier Jiang, the network is designed to
maintain the sustained use of bamboo and rattan, conduct relevant
research and protect the interests of both the producers and
consumers.
</P>
<P>
"Making greater use of bamboo and rattan will not only
contribute to the world's poverty relief work, but also benefit
the protection of forests and ecological environment," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said the founding of the network was significant in terms
of economic development and environmental improvements.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the economic potential of these two resources
has not been fully recognized by society though the value of
bamboo and rattan products in the world had reached 15 billion
U.S. dollars, and two thirds of the world's population
uses bamboo and rattan products regularly.
</P>
<P>
Some representatives from the nine member countries --
Bangladesh, Canada, China, Indonesia, Myanmar, Nepal, the
Philippines, Peru and Tanzania -- and other relevant countries, as
well as international organizations, attended today's ceremony.

ROME, November 7 (Xinhua) -- State prosecutor Maurizio
Passarini began summing up of the case against Formula One team
Frank Williams and five other men in Imola, Italy on Friday, as
the trial continued over the death of Brazilian Ayrton Senna.

<P>
All the six are charged of negligence, over the car and the
circuit respectively, and will face a maximum sentence of five
years in jail. A verdict is expected around mid-December.
</P>
<P>
Passarini claims that Senna's steering column failed as he
approached the high-speed Tamburello bend, causing him to crash
into a concrete wall. He has indicted race officials over alleged
failings in the track.

<HEADLINE> Water Supply, Sanitation Conference Ends in Manila </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A five-day Water Supply and
Sanitation Collaborative Council meeting ended here today with a
call for more efforts to achieve adequate water and proper
sanitation in developing countries in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of the meeting here,
Richard Jolly, chairman of the Water Supply and Sanitation
Collaborative Council, said that in the world today about 1.1
billion people lack access to safe drinking water and 2.9 billion
people are without hygienic sanitation.
</P>
<P>
The problem is more serious in Asia, where 630 million people
lack clean drinking water, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that three quarters of the people who lack
hygienic sanitation globally are in Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to Jolly, the international community must invest at
least 10 billion U.S. dollars annually in the next 10 years to
solve the water shortage and sanitation problems.
</P>
<P>
"The 21st century will and must achieve adequate water and
proper sanitation for all. In order to reach this challenging
goal, various actions will have to be implemented in a growing
water scarcity globally," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Low cost water and sanitation strategies as well as
conservation of water are becoming indispensable tools in order to
re-distribute water to all using the available financial resources
for the water and sanitation community," he said.
</P>
<P>
About 250 experts from 50 countries attended the 4th Water
Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council Global Forum, which is
sponsored by the Asian Development Bank and the Philippine
government.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the participants discussed regional action
programs to improve water and sanitation service, especially for
the poor.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed key issues such as the need for a greater
degree of collaboration in sanitation service, safer water for the
urban poor, and more involvement of communities in decision-making
process.
</P>
<P>
Formed in 1991, the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative
Council seeks to pool expertise, maximize use of limited resources
and foster cooperation in the pursuit of improved and sustainable
water and sanitation services for the poor.

<HEADLINE> Hirano Charged With Tax Evasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Nagoya Grampus Eight
international midfielder Takashi Hirano, along with his teammate
Go Oiwa and professional cyclist Misao Hagiwara were charged with
income tax evasion at a district court on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors said Hirano evaded taxes totalling 65 million
yen, Oiwa 2.95 million yen and Hagiwara 800,000 yen.
</P>
<P>
No criminal charges have been filed against them because the
amount of taxes they evaded was small.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Grampus Eight and the Japanese Football
Association said the players would not be penalized.
</P>
<P>
Hirano will play for Japan in a World Cup Asian Zone Group B
qualifier against Kazakhstan on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I'll never do again. I'll just try to play my best, because my
job is to reach the World Cup finals." Hairano said.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Draws Worldwide Attention (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 7 (Xinhua) -- A number of
executives from multinational companies arrived in Yichang today,
to attend tomorrow's grand ceremony for the damming of the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, approximately 1,000 domestic and overseas reporters
will gather at the project site for coverage of the biggest,
monumental project China has undertaken since the Great Wall
built some 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Also, two weeks later, the chairman and secretary general of
the International Committee of Large Dams (ICOLD) are also
expected to lead a delegation of more than 400 first-rate dam
engineering experts in the world to the worksite, where they will
hold group discussions and consultations for the numerous
technical problems in erecting the 185-m Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
However, this epitomizes the in-coming of groups of noted
figures and personages from overseas at the worksite, according to
Xu Keda, the director for international cooperation with the China
Yangtze Three Gorges Project Development Corporation (CYTGPDC).
</P>
<P>
Still a common county town five years ago, the dam site
has been flocked by some 5,000 overseas visitors from nearly 40
countries and regions over the past five years, including
government officials, statesmen, businessmen and world-renowned
water conservation experts, said Xu.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,800 overseas reporters have come to the worksite
to cover the project by October, according to Xu.

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Draws Worldwide Attention (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Although there are still some doubts related to the project's
resettlement program and the impact on environment, more and more
people from the international community have become aware that the
Three Gorges Project is a great endeavor of the mankind to improve
its living conditions," said the company director for
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Just as a French writer has pointed out out, the Three Gorges
Project represents a restored national pride of the Chinese people
as a result of the considerable economic growth, and this world's
biggest dam will surely amaze the whole world.
</P>
<P>
"The Three Gorges Project, upon completion in 2009, will be a
symbol that China has victoriously marched into the 21st century,"
said an English journalist.
</P>
<P>
The 25-billion-US-dollar project is expected to chalk up more
than 20 world records in the water conservation field. Meanwhile,
it is also confronted with numerous complex technical problems
involving the damming of deep-water river, development of
large-scale ship lift, and so on.
</P>
<P>
"Solutions to these complex technical problems will advance the
world development of water conservation technologies to a new era,
that's why scientist worldwide have shown growing interest in the
project. They all feel honored to take part in the project, and
still more to do some field research at the dam site," said a
Chinese water conservation expert.
</P>
<P>
As an indication, a hydro-power company in the Republic of
Korea sends their hydro-electric engineers to the Three Gorges
Project site for training, while a company in Japan also conducts
technological exchanges with the CYTGPDC on a regular basis.

"The Three Gorges Project is a great magnet for the water
conservation engineers worldwide, since it not only helps to
enrich their personal experiences, but to enhance the competitive
edge of the hydro-power companies in the international market,"
said an official with a Japanese hydro-power company.
</P>
<P>
An even more important reason behind the growing world
attention to the project is the huge market it has created for the
world businesses.
</P>
<P>
Since one fourth of the project's total investment of 25
billion US dollars is to be used to purchase of construction
equipment, including three billion US dollars for importing
equipment.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than half of the equipment in use at the dam site
are imported. And the most lucrative contract of the project also
went to two European consortia in August, valued at 740 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The damming of Yangtze will give rise to more opportunities for
world manufacturers of transformers, high-voltage equipment to be
used in power plant, since the CYTGPDC is to hold another round of
international bidding for the purchase of such equipment next year.
</P>
<P>
"Participation in the Three Gorges Project is the most
effective advertisement for world businesses," said the president
of an European machinery company.
</P>
<P>
In response to the increasing world attention, the project
developer is also determined to adopt a more open mind, as the
general manager of the CYTGPDC Lu Youmei has put it, "As a
super-large project, the TGP demands the most sophisticated
technologies in the world, the most advanced management expertise,
the best equipment, and favorable government financial support."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Fundamentals Sound, Economic Prospects Favorable: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- "The underlying
fundamentals" in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
are "sound" and its "economic prospects" are "favorable," the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) said in a statement circulated
here today.
</P>
<P>
In its 14-point statement, the IMF also praised the SAR
government for its successful operation since Hong Kong returned
to the motherland on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The IMF issued the "concluding statement" after its delegation
visited Hong Kong from October 28 to November 5. During the visit,
members of the delegation held a series of talks with SAR
government officials and business people.
</P>
<P>
In its statement, the IMF said economic prospects and the
policy environment in the Hong Kong SAR have been overshadowed
recently by the disruptions in many of the Southeast Asian
economies, as well as by volatility within local financial
markets.
</P>
<P>
"Despite these events," the world's largest monetary
organization continued, "we continue to be of the view that the
underlying fundamentals in Hong Kong SAR are sound."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the resumption of sovereignty by the People's
Republic of China was accomplished smoothly, it added.
</P>
<P>
Based on recent data, the IMF said that the SAR's economy
continues to recover from the growth slowdown of 1994-95.
</P>
<P>
"Real GDP (Gross Domestic Product) growth accelerated further
to an annual rate of 6.25 percent during the first six months of
1997, from 5 percent in 1996. This reflected a pickup in
consumption, which seems to have been boosted by strengthened
confidence, as well as higher investment spending," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Given the strength in the first half, growth (in Hong Kong) is
expected to average 5.25-5.5 percent for the year as a whole," the
IMF predicted.
</P>
<P>
Describing the SAR's "medium-term economic prospects" as
"favorable," the IMF said: "Productivity is high, particularly
within the tradable goods and services sectors, and Hong Kong is
in a unique position to benefit from the growing demand by the
mainland for financial, business and trade-related services."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it noted, "The continued flexibility of goods and
labor markets gives confidence that the necessary adjustments will
be made as needed to changing economic circumstances."

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Decline on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
decline in thin trading on the Singapore market as the benchmark
Straits Times Industrials Index fell by another 19.28 points to
close at 1671.25 points today.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the fall in Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index, the
poor outlook for stock markets across the region and caution ahead
of new economic data in the United States due later Friday pushed
investors onto the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
In addition, declining property stocks and fears of another
selldown in regional currencies also helped drive prices lower,
they noted.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank further to 115.7 million units,
valued at 274.79 million Singapore dollars (about 176.15 million
U.S. dollars). Declines overwhelmed advances by 287 to 73, while
251 other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
RHB Capital Warrant99 was the most actively traded counter as
it registered a turnover of 5.008 million units. It was followed
by STIC which had 4.89 million shares traded. The Hong Kong Land
was next with 4.09 million shares changed hands.
</P>
<P>
Local computer sound card maker Creative 50 led the gainers of
the day as it rose by 1.1 dollars to finish at 44.3 Singapore
dollars. ASEAN Fund gained 70 cents to end at 10.8 U.S. dollars,
while Malaya Banking 200 increased by 55 cents to close at 6.7
Singapore dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, NBT was the biggest loser as it declined by
one dollar to end at 23.5 Singapore dollars. First Capital fell by
90 cents to close at 2.86 Singapore dollars. The Development Bank
of Singapore (DBS) Foreign lost 80 cents to finish at 15 Singapore
dollars.

<HEADLINE> HK to Require License for Optical Discs Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A trade official of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) has proposed to introduce
licensing requirements for the optical discs (including compact
discs) manufacturing equipment imported into or exported from Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Trade and Industry Bureau (TIB) said that
the proposed licensing requirement was one of the measures taken
by the government to prevent Hong Kong from becoming a haven for
the manufacture of pirated optical discs.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, made by Director General of Trade Alan Lai Nin,
was published in the SAR government gazette today and will be
tabled at the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) next week for
negative vetting.
</P>
<P>
Subject to the approval of the PLC, the proposal, Amendment
Order to the Import and Export (General) Regulation, will come
into force on December 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
It would enable Customs officers to better trace the origin and
destination of legally imported equipment and facilitate the
gathering of intelligence on suspected copyright piracy
activities.
</P>
<P>
The proposed Amendment Order stipulates that any person who
imports into or exports from Hong Kong optical disc manufacturing
equipment without a valid licence commits an offense and is liable
to a maximum fine of two million HK dollars (256,410 U.S. dollars)
and imprisonment of seven years.
</P>
<P>
"We are conscious of the need to be business-friendly, and the
licensing requirements will be simple and straight-forward. There
will be no charge for application of such a license," the
spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Promises Amnesty for Prince Ranariddh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Cambodian Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said here today that he is working with King
Norodom Sihanouk to grant a royal amnesty to ousted First Prime
Minister Prince Norodom Ranariddh to enable him to run in the
general election next May.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto,
Hun Sen said he has agreed with the King that Prince Ranariddh should
have a chance to take part in politics again, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian leader told Hashimoto that with his direction and
the king's authority, Prince Ranariddh, who has been in exile since
being ousted from power in a military conflict in July, could engage
again in politics in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who arrived here on Wednesday for a six-day unofficial
visit to Japan, said that Cambodia's National Assembly has
endorsed part of a necessary election law to establish an
independent election commission whose members do not belong to
political parties.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto welcomed Hun Sen's assurances, saying that Japan would do
its utmost to help Cambodia hold the election successfully.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Cambodia has restored security to a level better than
before the July conflict, Hun Sen expressed the hope for the recovery
of investment and tourism from Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto replied that Japan will maintain its friendly ties with
Cambodia and will continuously support its efforts to rebuild the
economy.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: HK Tourism Industry Tries To Find Way Out By Wang Qun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's top foreign
exchange earner, the tourism industry, is doing its upmost to tide
over the difficulties brought on by the recent financial turmoil
in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a difficult time," admitted Amy Chan Cheung
Yi-yim, executive director of the Hong Kong Tourism Association
(HKTA), when talking about the slump in the industry over the past
few months.
</P>
<P>
Figures speak for themselves. Tourist arrivals plunged a
massive 35 percent in July, 24 percent in August and 22 percent in
September, compared with the same months in 1996.
</P>
<P>
For the whole of 1997, Chan expected the number of tourists to
drop at least 4 percent from 1996, the year when the industry
saw an unprecedented boom.
</P>
<P>
In Hong Kong's largest overseas market of Japan, visitor
figures have nose-dived for months.
</P>
<P>
"The weakening of the Japanese yen was beyond our expectations,
and caused a sharp drop in the number of Japanese tourists," Mrs.
Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese tourist arrivals plummeted 61 percent in July, 52
percent in August and 61 percent in September. Having visited Hong
Kong in large numbers last year, Japanese visitors won't come back
until the place turns much more inexpensive, a travel agent
predicted recently.
</P>
<P>
For Hong Kong's another traditional short-haul market,
Southeast Asia, people's travel plans were obviously disrupted by
the recent financial turmoil which swept their currency and stock
markets.
</P>
<P>
The other side of the story is that the turmoil led to tourists
deserting Hong Kong for cheaper Southeast Asian destinations.
People would not choose Hong Kong when they can go to Thailand or
Indonesia where their money is worth much more, the travel agent
said.
</P>
<P>
It is true that the local tourism industry has not anticipated
such a terrible drop-off. To make things worse, hotel prices
soared in the first half of the year, scaring away potential
visitors and sending a wrong message that Hong Kong was booked
out.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone in the industry a year ago thought it would be
booming. Even I did," said Howard Young, the Provisional
Legislative Council's tourism spokesman. "A lot of people in the
industry recognized the problem too late."
</P>
<P>
To reverse the downturn, the government-backed tourism
promotion body HKTA and the linked industries, such as the hotels
and the airlines, are making concerted efforts.
</P>
<P>
The HKTA has put on an intensive advertising campaign targeting
the short-haul markets. In October HKTA staff accompanied Chief
Executive of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa
on his visit to Japan for a winter promotion.
</P>
<P>
It also invited a lot of travel agents and travel media from
around the world to visit Hong Kong in the last few months, and
will invite major wholesalers and operators in December, so they
can see what Hong Kong is like after its handover to China and
tell their people.
</P>
<P>
To help keep Hong Kong in the world traveler's eyes, Tung
announced in his maiden policy address that the SAR government
will loan 100 million HK dollars (12.6 million U.S. dollars) to
the HKTA to start up an International Events Fund, designed to
bring together private-sector partnerships to stage 50 major
international events here over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Vistour, a visitor and tourism strategy report, maps out the
HKTA's vision for the longer term development of the local
industry, to be specific, the Spotlight Hong Kong program, which
aims at developing and publicizing ongoing and future events which
keep Hong Kong in the world view in the run up to the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
The culmination of this theme is for Hong Kong to host an grand
international exposition in 2001, with the West Kowloon
reclamation area developed into the exposition site.
</P>
<P>
New projects such as a film city, a virtual realty theme park
and a new cruise terminal are also being studied by the HKTA.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure development needed to cater for the rising
number of tourists in future in on hand. Over 40 hotel projects
have been submitted to the Building Department which will yield
16,000 rooms on top of the existing 33,000.
</P>
<P>
When the new airport at Chek Lap Kok opens next April, an
increase in the passenger capacity is also a blessing to the local
tourism industry.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- George Komakech Omona, a
field commander of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), has died of
AIDS, "The New Vision" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The self-styled Brigadier died Wednesday in a military
hospital in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, Ugandan military
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The information about the death of the commander is

<P>
Joseph Kony, the leader of LRA, acknowledged in 1994 that most

</P>
<P>
The latest boost to the government's morale came with a
report that Kony and 300 of his fighters were trapped in a
remote and desolate part of the country.

LRA is a rebel group of Christian fundamentalists operating in
northern Uganda with 700-1,000 members, a recent official
estimate said.
</P>
<P>
The failure of numerous attempts by the Ugandan army to keep
the LRA from terrorizing the towns and villages of the Gulu and
Kitgum districts has led to Ugandans talks about a possible
escalation of fighting against the rebels backed by Sudan.

<HEADLINE> Round-Up: HK Leadership Backs Currency Link System by Zhang Tiegang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The leadership of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China stands firm in
maintaining the Hong Kong dollar's exchange rate regime pegged with
the U.S. currency, amid continuing ups and downs in the local
stock market.
</P>
<P>
Ordinary people would suffer, if the economy of the SAR became
unstable with the cancelment of the 14-year-old peg system, warned
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the SAR, Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the SAR government was determined to defend
the link, despite the fact that measures taken to that end had led
to successive interest rate rises.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange rate link is very important to the economic
development and stability of Hong Kong," Tung said Thursday
morning when asked whether Hong Kong people should continue to
bear the cost of keeping the peg.
</P>
<P>
"If our economy becomes unstable, it will affect every single
citizen. It is thus very important for us to maintain the link,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that there had been some degree of interest
rate volatility, noting that the one-to-three-month interest rate
rose Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued, the government has the absolute total
ability to maintain the linked exchange rate, because the SAR's
economic fundamentals are "really very good and very sound," Tung
said.
</P>
<P>
In opinion of the SAR monetary authorities, the policy of
linking the Hong Kong dollar to the U.S. dollar at an exchange
rate of 7.8 to 1 within a narrow range has served Hong Kong well
for the past 14 years.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on today's statement by the International Monetary
Fund (IMF), Financial Secretary for the SAR Donald Tsang said that
the recent mission of the IMF gave a very positive assessment of
Hong Kong's economic fundamentals and a firm and clear endorsement
of the SAR's economic policy framework.
</P>
<P>
The assessment was made in a concluding statement by an IMF
Staff Mission following a visit to Hong Kong from October 28 to
November 5. It noted in the statement that the "underlying
fundamentals of the Hong Kong economy are sound." "This is
underscored by its strong fiscal position, huge foreign exchange
reserves and healthy balance of payments," it added.
</P>
<P>
The IMF noted that the existing policy framework, including the
linked exchange rate system, prudent fiscal policy, careful
supervision of the financial sector and non-interventionist
approach in the factor market, has proved to be effective and
resilient in withstanding external pressure on the Hong Kong
market.
</P>
<P>
"The IMF's endorsement of our linked exchanged rate system
further strengthens our commitment to maintain the system," Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, Joseph
Yam, said: "The visit by the IMF Mission is timely and important.
I am glad that the IMF, having seen how our system was put to test
and how we responded, has given a firm endorsement of the linked
exchange rate system and top rating to our monetary management."
</P>
<P>
Their determination to defend the currency link system is being
backed by a lot of local businessmen and bankers, who maintain
that the economy of the SAR is very strong and healthy despite the
recent fluctuations in the stock market.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Industrial Policy, Technology Transfer held in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) - With the new century and
millennium approaching, it is necessary for the Asia-Pacific
region to develop high-tech and high value added industry for a
continuous and sustained economic development, a leading Chinese
scientist said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao, president of the China Association for Science
and Technology, said that the region, which has been closely
watched by the whole world for its rapid economic stride, needs to
do so to keep up with this momentum in the next century.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was addressing as a special guest at the opening ceremony
of a one-day seminar titled "Forum on Industrial Policy and
Technology Transfer -- An Asia Pacific Perspective" here today.
</P>
<P>
China has set a goal of realizing modernization at the mid-21st
century, when she celebrates the 100th anniversary of the founding
of the People's Republic, Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
To attain this goal, reforms are underway in China on the
economic structure including the ownership system and policies of
promoting sciences and technologies to speed up technological
reforms are encouraged for a continued economic development.
</P>
<P>
The return of Hong Kong to China earlier this year has made
even more favorable conditions for Hong Kong to increase
exchanges and co-operation with the science and technology
community in the mainland, he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's comments were echoed by Zhau Wai-yin, deputy president
of the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. "Problems facing many
companies and firms today are increasingly smaller profit margins,
faster changes in technology and rapid product changes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Various technology foresight programs had been launched to
assess the impact of various scientific and technological
developments on industrial competitiveness, wealth creation and
quality of life, he recalled.
</P>
<P>
But more needs to be done, he said.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the seminar is to provide a platform for
industrialists, business leaders, policy makers and academics to
discuss strategies which developed and developing countries
should pursue to sustain their industrial development, especially
on the role of the government in promoting technology transfer in
Hong Kong so as to speed up the transformation of local industry
to a high technology and high value added one.
</P>
<P>
The opening session this morning featured four keynote speeches
by experts from Japan, South Korea, Singapore and China's
mainland.

<HEADLINE> IMF Endorses HK's Linked Exchange Rate System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A mission of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) has strongly endorsed the
continued commitment of the government of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) to its exchange rate system pegged
with the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The system has proven its ability as an anchor for economic
stability since 1983 and it can continue to successfully play this
 role, the IMF mission said in a concluding statement following an
 annual consultation discussions with the business people and
government officials of Hong Kong from October 28 to November 5.
</P>
<P>
The statement was published by the Government Information
Service (GIS) of Hong Kong today.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission pointed out that the link also plays a critical
role in maintaining confidence in Hong Kong's role as an
international financial center because it demonstrates the
continued commitment to free-market policies and monetary autonomy
under the "one country, two systems" approach.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have taken forceful action during the past two
weeks to tighten significantly monetary conditions, and have
successfully demonstrated their ability and commitment to defend
the link, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Recent events demonstrate that the system is working exactly as
intended, and there are encouraging signs that speculative
pressures are easing, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF mission said that it is confident that the authorities
will be cautious and avoid a premature loosening of monetary
conditions, despite the short-term pain brought by high interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
The mission also endorses the SAR government's commitment to
prudent fiscal policies, including the commitment under the Basic
Law to avoid fiscal deficits.
</P>
<P>
The authorities' commitment to a non-interventionist approach
based on the rules would enhance the economy's ability to
withstand the recent regional and financial market turmoil, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In our view, the existing policy framework, which includes the
linked exchange rate system, a prudent fiscal policy, the careful
supervision of the financial sector, and a non-interventionist
approach, has been extremely successful in fostering strong and
sustainable growth in the past," the mission said.

<HEADLINE> Activists Quit Sinn Fein over Peace Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 7 (Xinhua) -- As many as 12 members resigned
from the IRA's political wing Sinn Fein after a row erupted over
its Northern Ireland peace strategy, local report said today.
</P>
<P>
These members, including some veteran political activists,
walked out of a meeting in Dundalk in the Irish Republic late
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Fra Brown, a former municipal councillor and long-serving Sinn
Fein member in the Irish border county of Louth, was among those
who left the party, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Branch chairman Oven Hanratty, who led the walk-out, said it
was prompted by the party's acceptance of the "Mitchell
Principles," a code of non-violence which it adopted as its ticket
to Anglo-Irish sponsored peace talks in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The Mitchell Principles bind parties to a disavowal of violence
and to guerrilla disarmament. The Irish Republic Army (IRA) has
said it will not scrap its weapons before a political settlement
of the Northern Ireland conflict.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the split among the party, the Sinn Fein
leadership was still in control and the ceasefire, called in July,
was not under pressure.
</P>
<P>
Those resigned represented only a minority, BBC quoted Sinn
Fein chairman Mitachell Mclaughlin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report added that a member of the party's county committee
had also said the party still firmly supported Sinn Fein president
Gerry Adams's strategy on the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Deficit Eats Into Yearly Revenue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's deficit has climbed up
to almost 3.2 trillion Lebanese pounds (about 2 billion
U.S. dollars) in the first nine months of this year, yielding a
deficit to expenditure ratio of 53.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
An analysis article published in today's Lebanese newspaper
Beirut Times said that although government revenues registered a
yearly increase of 10.5 percent to top 2.7 trillion pounds (about
1.7 billion dollars), they fell 11.5 percent below budget.
</P>
<P>
Spending, on the other hand, recorded a yearly growth of 7
percent to reach nearly 5.9 trillion pounds (about 3.7 billion
dollars), exceeding projections by as high as 22.6 percent,
producing the large gap between the budgeted and actual deficit to
expenditure ratios.
</P>
<P>
The article said the public revenues have significantly
increased from 10.8 percent in terms of GDP in 1992 to around 17
percent currently; and a further increase will necessitate a more
efficient tax collection system.
</P>
<P>
Actually, up to 44 percent of total revenues are derived from
tariffs on trade and international exchange, while tax on income,
profits and capital contribute for a minimal share of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
In other words, the bulk of public revenues comes from
indirect taxes, including tariffs, taxes on goods and services
and fees, which are notoriously known for their potential
inflationary pressures on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Public spending in terms of GDP has also increased at a quicker
pace than anticipated, reaching 36 percent in 1997, up from 25
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The article said that the budget deficit is currently the main
concern of most government officials as this year's fiscal results
have so far been disappointing. An improvement in this area is
urgently needed, and unless next year's public spending and
revenues are in line with the budget, the Lebanese economy will be
in serious trouble.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Regrets Tokyo's Repeated Claim Over Islets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
deeply regretted Japan's claim of sovereignty over the Tokdo
islets, known as Takeshima in Japanese, said South Korean foreign
ministry spokesman Lee Kyu-hyung today.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Muraoka Kanezo said Thursday
that the islets, located in the south of the Sea of Japan, was
under Japanese sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In the same day, Japanese deputy foreign minister Yanai
Shunji called on South Korean Ambassador to Japan Kim Tae-zhee
to deliver his government's protest over Seoul's construction of a
pier on the islets and urged its demolition.
</P>
<P>
Tokdo islets are an "inseparable part of the territory of South
Korea based on authoritative historical evidence, geography and
international law as ambassador Kim told (Yanai Shunji)," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the construction of the pier on Tokdo islets is
nothing more than an exercise of the South Korean government's
sovereignty and jurisdiction over the territory," and urged Japan
not to raise an issue on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korean deputy foreign minister for political
affairs Song Young-shik summoned in Japanese charge d'affaires ad
interim Odano Nobutake at the embassy here to deliver Seoul's
regret over Japan's repeated claims over the Tokdo islets.
</P>
<P>
Japan's territorial claim came just after South Korea held a
ceremony to mark the completion of the pier, which was started a
couple of years ago.
</P>
<P>
The quay, with the ability to accommodate a 500-ton ship, is
built to help facilitate berthing at the islets, which cover a
total land area of 250 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Tokdo has been a major hurdle in revising a fishing agreement
signed in 1965 between the two countries and defining the
200-nautical-mile exclusive economic zones under the United
Nations convention on the law of the sea.

PARIS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Six years after the death of French folksinger Yves Montand, a
court of appeal in Paris ordered on Thursday the exhumation of his
body at Cemetery Pere Lachaise. A sample of his DNA will be compared
with that of Anrore Drossard, who said that she was his daughter. In
an interview with Liberation, Jean-Pierre Changeux, president of the
Ethic Commission, said that the ``moral testament'' of the dead, who
refused the test during his lifetime, is not respected by the court
decision.
</P>
<P>
-- Russia today celebrated the 80th anniversary of the October
Revolution. The Communist Party of Russia was to organize a march
from the October Square in Moscow, while some other leftwing parties
would also mark the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- France's biggest organization of owners of trucking companies,
the Union of Federations of Transport (UFT), presented Thursday
night a project of protocol to put an end to the labor conflict
which has left many highways in France blocked by striking lorry
drivers since Monday. After the marathon talks which lasted from
Wednesday morning until Thursday night, the perspective of a rapid
solution to the trucking labor conflict still looks remote. The
unions of Force Ouvriere and Confederation Generale du Travail said
they would not sign the protocol, while two other unions, the CFDT
and CFTC, said they were satisfied.
</P>
<P>
-- With the moral of enterprise managers, trade transaction
volumes and demand for manufactured products all on the rise, the
French Ministry of Economy and Finance confirmed on Thursday that a
2.3 percent growth of GDP in 1997 will be realized in France.

<HEADLINE> Washington Talks "Great progress": Israeli FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEl AVIV, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Despite the negative
assessment by the Palestinian side, Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy insisted today the just-concluded Israeli-Palestinian talks
in Washington made "great progress" in advancing the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon arrival at Ben Gurion airport
from the United States, Levy said the trilateral meeting with
Palestinian National Authority deputy Mahmoud Abbas and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, which concluded Thursday,
would undoubtedly advance the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Progress was made toward the resolution of the remaining
issues on the agenda, and the working procedures were
determined...all sides agreed that we would not continue working
in an atmosphere of crisis," he said.
</P>
<P>
Levy disclosed that Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are
to resume talks on Sunday, and within ten days heads of
Interim Agreement Committees from both sides will meet with the
participation of Levy and Abbas.
</P>
<P>
But he conceded that major differences remain between the
two sides, especially on the time-out of settlements and Israeli
further troop redeployments in the West Bank. Palestinian
officials have blamed Israel for the failure of the Washington
talks because of Israel's refusal to make concessions on the
two central issues.
</P>
<P>
"We did not solve all the problems, and it was not
expected that we would finish all the issues at the meeting,
but (we) got the peace process back on the track of
cooperation and dialogue in a proper atmosphere," said Levy.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister believed he had achieved his goal for
the meeting as both sides agreed to settle the dispute on
the basis of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli officials counter-charged the Palestinian
side for the lack of tangible progress made in the Washington
talks. Israel Radio quoted a government official as accusing the
Palestinian negotiators of trying to create a crisis atmosphere
to derail the upcoming Middle East and Norther Africa Economic
Conference to be held in Qatar so to exert pressure on Israel.
</P>
<P>
Levy added that he met Albright several times in Washington
and relations between Israel and the U.S. had been improved
"immeasurably". Before leaving Washington Thursday, Levy said
Albright and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet
next week, possibly in London.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Middle East and North Africa Economic
Conference to be held in Doha next week, Levy said Israel will send
a delegation to the meeting. But he added that he was unsure
whether he himself would head the Israeli delegation.

<HEADLINE> Iraq not Want Crisis With UN, Iraqi Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz said today that Iraq is not seeking a crisis with the
United Nations, or the Security Council, but demands its legitimate
rights be protected.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference here at the end of a mission by
U.N. envoys to Baghdad, Aziz accused that it is the United States
which makes crisis whenever it needs.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the standoff between the U.N. and Iraq
after Baghdad decided on October 29 to expel U.S. members in the
U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Aziz conspicuously drew a distinction between the objective and
conduct of the U.N. and those of the U.S. and denounced the
U.S. of mixing its ulterior motives with U.N. mission in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on disarming Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction and verification has been used as a
cover by the U.S. against Iraq, Aziz said, citing U.S. officers'
dominance in the U.N. inspections teams.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. delegation was in Baghdad to convey a letter of the
Secretary General Kofi Annan to the Iraqi leadership asking for a
full implementation of relevant U.N. resolutions and revocation of
its decision to bar U.S. personnel from inspection sites.
</P>
<P>
Aziz defended Iraqi decision by saying that the U.S. members in
leading posts of the inspection teams with decision-making power
have been deliberately trying to prolong the crippling sanctions
against Iraq imposed since 1990.
</P>
<P>
He asserted that the U.N. commission should have finished its
mission in Iraq after six and half years of work under
U.N. mandate unless it does not want to complete its job on
unacceptable excuses in the U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
He said that the UNSCOM mission in Iraq could be an endless
game under U.S. control as the U.S. administration has publicly
stated that it would not agree to lift the sanctions until Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein is toppled.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N. should intervene to protect Iraqi
legitimate rights as Iraq is a member of the international body.
</P>
<P>
He stated that as far as the U.N. resolutions are concerned,
Iraq has fully implemented them and already destroyed all weapons
banned by the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On the contrary, however, the U.N. Security Council has not
done its commitment to lift its sanctions on Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the U.N. to establish a real and impartial inspection
system and study the facts about the implementation by Iraq of the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Aziz told reporters that he has shown to the U.N. envoys
documents and video about the UNSCOM conducts in Iraq which has
nothing to do with U.N. objectives but the U.S. interests.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Iraq is against the flights by
U.S. reconnaissance plane U-2 in Iraqi air space as it would
garner information for anticipated U.S. military strikes on Iraqi
targets as it did several times before.
</P>
<P>
He asked the U.N. envoys to deliver Iraqi demands to Annan and he
would go the Security Council to explain Iraqi concerns and
grievances.
</P>
<P>
The three-member U.N. team left here today for New York to
submit a report to the U.N. chief on the two-day talks with Iraqi
officials.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese-Russian Relationship Witnesses Constant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 7 (Xinhua) -- At the invitation of President
Jiang Zemin of the People's Republic of China, President Boris
Yeltsin of the Russian Federation will pay a third state visit to
China on November 9-11 to hold the fifth summit between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the Chinese-Russian relationship has
attained a rapid and healthy development. Along with frequent
high-level visits between their leaders, China-Russia economic and
trade cooperation has been expanded and cultural exchanges
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The development of relationship between China and Russia has in
the past years undergone three steps.
</P>
<P>
First, it was put on the right track of developing
good-neighborliness. In December 1992, President Yeltsin paid his
first visit to China. During this visit, leaders of the two
countries issued a joint declaration on the establishment of
good-neighborly relationship, putting the bilateral ties on the
track of cooperation with mutual benefits. China and Russia shared
the view that the improvement of bilateral relationship conformed
to the basic interests of their peoples, and would benefit peace
and stability in Asia and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
The second step was the establishment of a constructive
partnership oriented toward the 21st century. In September 1994,
President Jiang Zemin paid a formal visit to Russia. There,
leaders of China and Russia issued a second joint declaration on
a constructive partnership toward the 21st century, a partnership
built on the five principles of peaceful coexistence and
characterized by complete equality, good neighborliness, mutual
benefits, non-alignment and commitment not to target at a third
country. Also, they pledged not to first use nuclear weapons, nor
to aim strategic nuclear weapons at each other.
</P>
<P>
The third step was the establishment of a strategic partnership
toward the 21st century. In April 1996, President Yeltsin visited
China again to sign a third joint declaration. Announcing the
development of a strategic partnership of equality, mutual
confidence and coordination towards the 21st century, leaders of
both sides agreed to enhance cooperation in areas where they
shared common or similar ground, and seek mutual understanding
where they held different views. At the same time, they also
committed to conducting active dialogues on such issues as
strategic stability, the new political and economic world order as
well as the security and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region,
through building a mechanism for regular contacts.

<HEADLINE> Songs of Sino-Russian Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- "The song 'My Moscow' remains
as charming as it was over 40 years ago," said Chen Haosu as he
recalled his last visit to Russia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that workers at Moscow's ZEL Auto Plant entertained
a Chinese delegation headed by him in the plant's small theater,
and noted that Chinese President Jiang Zemin worked at ZEL for
further training in 1955.
</P>
<P>
"This was simply another example proving the deep friendship
and close contacts between the two peoples," said Chen,
vice-president of the Chinese People's Association for Friendship
with Foreign Countries (CPAFFC) and vice-president of the
China-Russia Friendship Association.
</P>
<P>
Chen noted that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will visit
Beijing next week and will present medals to four Chinese people
including a musician and a translator of Russian songs, for their
contributions to cultural exchanges between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
"Friendship between the two peoples provides a solid foundation
for the Sino-Russian strategic cooperative partnership initiated
due to the wisdom and vision of the leaders of the two countries,"
said Chen.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mutual trust and common will of the two
peoples enabled the two large countries to promptly discard Cold
War concepts and adopt a new form of relations in the post-Cold
War Era.
</P>
<P>
"Economic and trade cooperation have emerged as an increasingly
outstanding feature of people-to-people contacts between the two
countries," according to Chen.
</P>
<P>
Chen has led delegations of Chinese entrepreneurs and local
government officials to the China-Russia Forum on Trade, Economy,
Science and Technology since the annual event was introduced in
1995.
</P>
<P>
A delegation from small- to medium-sized enterprises in Russia
will visit Beijing later this month to attend the third
China-Russia Forum, an event co-sponsored by friendship
associations in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Books and photo albums have been published to facilitate mutual
understanding in culture. Chen also noted that 50-odd Chinese and
Russian cities have established sister city relations, with the
first meeting of their representatives held in Russia last May.
</P>
<P>
Chen said the Sino-Russian Friendship Committee for Peace and
Development will hold its first meeting in Beijing during
President Yeltsin's forthcoming visit. The committee, which
consists of nongovernmental units involving Sino-Russian contacts,
was inaugurated by Jiang and Yeltsin during their Moscow Summit in
April. Chen noted that the organization will become an important
communications channel linking the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"Friendly Sino-Russian relations can be compared to a
harmonious chorus, said Chen, adding that we will introduce more
new voices to the chorus to ensure the sounds of friendship
continue to grow louder."

JERUSALEM, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)
rounded up 168 Palestinians late Wedensday night in Hebron in an
action aimed at deterring further firebomb and pipebomb attacks on
IDF troops there, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted IDF source as saying that the roundup was in response
to an increasing number of assaults on IDF soldiers in the
area. The Palestinians were photographed so they could be
identified in the event any were involved in a future attack or
clash.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians maintained that as many as 300 people
were detailed in a two-hour action launched by the IDF just before
midnight.
</P>
<P>
Concerned with a possible time-out on contruction in
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Jewish settlers
announced on Thursday that another 300 housing units will be
constructed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Housing Ministry published a tender for the
construction of an additional 72 government-fund housing units.
</P>
<P>
Local council head Shlomo katan told the Israel Radio that the
units, which received governmental approval three weeks ago, had
been frozen under the former government.
</P>
<P>
During its just concluded Washington talks, the Palestinians
and Israelis failed to reach an agreement on the Jewsish
settlement issue, for which the United States wanted them to have
a definition of "time-out."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese-Russian Relationship Witnesses Constant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last April, President Jiang Zemin visited Russia again for the
forth summit with President Yeltsin. By reaching a joint statement
on international relations with Yeltsin, this visit added a new
chapter to the history of Chinese-Russian relationship.
</P>
<P>
As it develops in depth, issues concerning the Chinese-Russian
boundary left over from history are also tackled gradually.
</P>
<P>
On 16 May 1991, China and the former USSR signed an agreement
on the eastern section of the boundary. And in September of 1994,
when President Jiang Zemin was visiting the Russia Federation, the
two countries signed a similar agreement on the western section.
</P>
<P>
Now the two sides are surveying the boundary and erecting
landmarks, with most of the stretch already completed.
</P>
<P>
Sharing over 4,300 kilometers, China and Russia will enjoy a
boundary of friendship and promote trade and cultural exchanges in
their border regions by peacefully solving the boundary issues.
</P>
<P>
The mutual trust in the Chinese-Russian border areas has also
been strengthened. In April 1996, presidents of China, Russia,
Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan signed an agreement on
confidence building in the military field in border areas in
Shanghai. And last April, the five presidents signed another
agreement in Moscow on reduction of military forces in border
areas.
</P>
<P>
China shares more than 7,000 kilometers with Russia and the
other three countries. The conclusion of the agreements would
surely contribute to confidence building in their border areas and
offer a security mold different to that of the Cold War to
safeguard peace, security and stability in the Asia-Pacific region
and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
President Yeltsin is expected to be in China soon. His visit
will accelerate the development of Chinese-Russian strategic
partnership and raise their friendship and cooperation to a new
stage.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese
Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua today urged builders of the gigantic Three
Gorges Project to carry out its second- and third-phase construction
with still higher standards and better quality.
</P>
<P>
Zou, in an exclusive interview with Xinhua at the project site
here, said the builders should make good and conscientious
preparations for the second phase, which is soon to start after
tomorrow's river damming, signaling the completion of the first
phase.
</P>
<P>
"The second phase is the most difficult stage with arduous
tasks during the course of construction, which is a key program in
China's efforts to harness the Yangtze, the country's largest
river," the vice-premier noted. He called for attention to be
attached to the quality of the project and improving management
system so as to enable the project to reach the first-rate
standards.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he added, doing a good job in the massive
resettlement is vital to the success of the project.
</P>
<P>
He stressed on appropriate use of the resettlement fund,
including compensation to local people to be displaced, and
development of environment-friendly farming with high efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier required other regions in China and the
relevant government departments, taking the interests of the whole
into account, to continue contributing to the resettlement program
and businesses in relocation areas for the economic development of
the Three Gorges Project area.

<HEADLINE> Mad Cow Ground for Feed in Belgium by Mistake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The discovery of the first
case of mad cow disease in Belgium took a surprising turn as local
press today reported that its carcass had not been
destroyed at all.
</P>
<P>
Instead, it was used to fabricate animal feed by
mistake even though Belgian Agriculture Minister Karel Pinxten
said last week that the mad cow had been slaughtered and burned in
accordance with the European Union law.
</P>
<P>
Local television and newspaper reports quoted an agriculture
ministry spokesman as saying that the mistake was caused by a
veterinarian who took the case for a rabies prior to the final
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Pinxten as saying that the mistakenly
fabricated animal feed would not contaminate further in that the
feed fabrication procedure was a "secure" one.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Belgium had to destroy a herd of 34 cattle raised
together with the one found with the mad cow disease in a farm in
the province of Namur.
</P>
<P>
The positive diagnosis of the first case of mad cow was
announced late last week after several rounds of laboratory
analyses and the discovery made Belgium the eighth country in
Europe that has reported cases of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Mad cow disease is suspected of provoking in human beings a new
form of the fatal disease known as Creutzfeldt-Jacob that has
already claimed 21 lives in Britain.
</P>
<P>
So far, 261 cases among cattle were reported
in Switzerland, 210 cases in Ireland, 70 cases in Portugal, 28
cases in France, five cases in Germany, two cases in the
Netherlands and 170,000 cases in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Optimal Utilization of Water Resources Urged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Planning for optimal
utilization of scarce water resources must be at the core of
SADC's plan for regional integration and socio-economic
development, a Zambian minister has said.
</P>
<P>
Energy and Water Development Minister Suresh Desai made the
remarks here while opening a two-day workshop Tuesday on
preparation of the "Zambia water sector country situation report
(SCR)" for the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
round table conference scheduled for next year.
</P>
<P>
Desai was concerned that so much water is running off to the
sea every year, and a lot more is being lost through siltation of
rivers, and dams while very little is being done to harness,
store and conserve the water.
</P>
<P>
"Given the vulnerability of SADC member states to water
related shocks, planning for optimal utilization of scarce water
resources must be at the core of SADC's plans for regional
integration and socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
"There is potentially much to be gained from greater regional
cooperation in this respect. However, such cooperation must
proceed from a clear understanding of available water resources
and its future requirements for power production, human
consumption, the environment, agriculture, mining, and industrial
production," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
CSR coordinator Patrick Chipungu said at the workshop that the
Southern African region is experiencing wide variations and
fluctuations in distribution of rainfall with many areas
suffering periodic droughts.
</P>
<P>
Chipungu said CSR is going to analize quantitative aspects of
water resources in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The CSR is a SADC assignment, and each member state is
required to produce a report on its water sector.
</P>
<P>
The reports will form the base for a regional strategy to be
presented to the donor community at the round table conference to
solicit financial support.

<HEADLINE> GM Senior Official Fully Confident in China Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Rudy Schlais, president of
General Motors (GM) China Operations, has announced that GM's
investment in China will increase to three billion US dollars
before the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
He made the announcement yesterday just after his return to
Beijing from the United States, where he played host to Jiang
Zemin when the Chinese president toured the Hughes Aircraft
Corporation, a subordinate of GM, during his recent state visit to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Rudy Schlais, who is also global vice-president of GM, told
Xinhua and China Daily correspondents that now he is more
confident in GM's operation in China.
</P>
<P>
GM's investment in China is expected to hit two billion US
dollars in 1998, and the figure might rocket up to three billion
yuan in 1999, which would make GM one of the largest US investors
in China, Schlais said.
</P>
<P>
"GM aims to become China's largest supplier of automotive parts
and components and one of the top three complete vehicle
manufacturers in the country by the year 2005," he said.
</P>
<P>
GM has so far set up 16 projects in China, of which three are
solely-funded, according to Schlais. He also disclosed that
several new projects are now under negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Schlais was named global vice-president of GM and the president
of GM China Operations in 1994. His efforts contributed to the
successful founding in June this year of the Shanghai-GM
Automobile Co., Ltd., a joint venture between Shanghai Automobile
Industry (Group) Corp. and General Motors.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that new Buick cars with stroke volume as high as
2.98 liters are to be put into production in the second half of
1998. The company has mapped out plans to manufacture new Buicks
with more than 50 percent of the parts and components made
domestically, 10 percentage points higher than the requirement set
in China's automotive industrial policy.
</P>
<P>
Work for seeking international loans is progressing smoothly,
Schlais said, adding that money raised will be pumped into the
Buick project.
</P>
<P>
Schlais described the Shanghai project as a "tremendous
success." Its products will mainly be marketed in China, when the
first phase project is accomplished; and only six percent of its
products will be exported, he said.
</P>
<P>
Authoritative sources here said that the project is likely to
change the situation of China's reliance on import of medium- and
high-quality cars.
</P>
<P>
Schlais encouraged overseas business people to actively
participate in the investment in China, saying that China, which
maintains smooth economic growth without high inflation, is one of
the "bright spots" in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
By utilizing his influence in the United States, Schlais has
made unremitting efforts to lobby US administration and Congress
to grant permanent Most-Favored-Nation trade status to
China. "This will benefit both countries," he stressed.

</P>
<P>
Various areas in Shanxi have suffered from disasters throughout
1997, including serious drought and plant diseases which damaged
crops and led to a sharp reduction in agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has provided funds, fertilizer and
grain to help disaster victims resume agricultural production and
a normal life.
</P>
<P>
Special attention has also been paid to families facing
financial difficulties, as well as the families of military
personnel, martyrs, and injured or disabled soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The province enjoys social stability and farmers are currently
cultivating winter crops.
</P>
<P>
The city of Datong has increased efforts to expand its

<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 7 (Xinhua) -- No "apparent
changes" have been found in the environment of the Three Gorges
dam and reservoir area, a government official told a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
This should be attributed to the extensive environment
protection measures taken in the the building of the mammoth
project, said Guo Shuyan, deputy director of the Three Gorges
Project Construction Commission under the State Council.
</P>
<P>
Since construction of the project was launched in December
1994, he noted, more green space has been created and sewage water
and residue properly treated.
</P>
<P>
Guo added that displaced farmers are required to build
high-standard terraced fields and develop environment-friendly
farming in their resettled regions, and heavily pollutive
industrial enterprises are forbidden to move to new places.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest challenging invironmental issue for the reservoir
area is the treatment of waste sewage,"he noted, "China's
environment protection authorities plan to set up ten-plus sewage
treatment plants in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze,
five of which located in Chongqing municipality."
</P>
<P>
As an important part of China's efforts to harness the Yangtze
valley in a comprehensive way, the state is increasing funding for
planting forest-shelter belts in the river's upper reaches, Guo
said.

<HEADLINE> Weather Not to Affect Tomorrow's Damming: Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 7 (Xinhua) -- It will be
cloudy to overcast with possible intermittent drizzles tomorrow,
and the weather will not affect the blocking of the Yangtze,
according to experts here at the site of the Three Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
Nor will the hydrologic situation then be unfavorable for the
damming, predicted Zheng Shouren, chief engineer of the Yangtze
River Water Conservation Committee in charge of designing
techniques for the damming process, which marks the completion of
the first phase of the massive Three Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
Based on historical data on the Yangtze's hydrologic conditions
and present hydrologic forecasts, he explained, no major change is
expected to occur tomorrow in view of the different factors that
will influence the blocking, including the discharge, flow speed
and drop in water surface.
</P>
<P>
Hydrologic forecast by the committee for tomorrow indicated
that the discharge will be about 8,500 cu m per second, a flow
speed of 2.3 m per second, less than the designed 4.22 m per
second.
</P>
<P>
Zheng went on to note that the committee has prepared four
damming plans to ensure its success.
</P>
<P>
The main factors to affect the hydrological conditions here
include precipitation in the area around Chongqing and eastern
Sichuan upstream, and one of the four plans is able to deal with
record-hit precipitation.
</P>
<P>
Liang Yuli, deputy chief in charge of the damming process, said
that it had rained on the days when the damming was in its key
stages, including the field exercise on October 14, the most
difficult stage when the gap between the two sections of the
upstream cofferdam was closed from 130 m down to 40 m from October
26-27.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Liang expressed his full confidence that the
river-blockage will be a great success even if it rains.

<HEADLINE> 136 Suspected Drug Traffickers Netted in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's Drug Enforcement
Commission (DEC) last month arrested 136 suspects in connection
with trafficking of narcotics and psychotropic substances with a
street value of 432 million Kwacha (about 332,000 U.S. Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Times of Zambia today quoted DEC spokesman Mukutulu Sinyani as
saying here Thursday that the drugs seized included opium,
hashish and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
Among those arrested, 130 are Zambians, three Danes, two
Tanzanians and one from the Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
One notable operation in the Southern Province involved the
arrest of three villagers who had about 1.3 tons of marijuana
harvested and ready for smuggling to neighboring countries.
</P>

<HEADLINE> UN Envoys Short of Obtaining Iraqi Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy Lakhdar Ibrahimi
said here today his team is satisfied with the atmosphere during
the discussions in Iraq, but apparently short of obtaining a
Baghdad assurance to comply with U.N. mandates.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Ibrahimi said the discussion
between his team and Iraqi officials were conducted in "good
atmosphere."
</P>
<P>
He said his team will convey a letter from the Iraqi leadership
to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan immediately back in New York
and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz will go to the Security
Council in the coming days to voice Iraqi concerns and grievances.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoys shied away from making comments on the results
of the U.N. team's talks with Iraqi officials but said it has
clearly carried out the mission entrusted by the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, the U.N. envoys, under the
instruction of the secretary general, held four rounds of
discussions with the Iraqi side and conveyed "what the reaction of
the Security Council members to Iraqi decision on October 29."
</P>
<P>
They delivered a letter from the secretary general asking
Baghdad to go back to the status quo before October 29 and revoke
its decision to expel U.S. weapon inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided to ban U.S. weapon inspectors from joining
U.N. inspection, in reaction to a U.N. threat with further
sanctions if Baghdad continued to tamper with weapon inspection
missions.
</P>
<P>
The three-men U.N. delegation listened to Iraqi concerns and
grievances with "respect, patience and interest," and will report
Iraqi requests to the Security Council, according to Ibrahimi.
</P>
<P>
And Iraq has agreed to suspend the execution of its decision to
expel the U.S. personnel with the U.N. inspection mission.

<HEADLINE> Gold Asia '97 Exhibition Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Gold Asia '97
exhibition opened here today, displaying the world's best jewelry
and other gold products.
</P>
<P>
The three-day exhibition has attracted 100 leading
manufacturers from 14 countries and regions, and 30,000 pieces of
carefully-selected, high quality jewelry and other gold products
are on display.
</P>
<P>
At the exhibition, Kerr Cruikshanks, regional chief executive
for the Far East of the World Gold Council, said the exhibition
would introduce a variety of unique gold products for extensive
distribution throughout the entire Far East region.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will also provide an opportunity for members of
the trade to get to know the latest market trends, innovations and
developments, he said.
</P>
<P>
Opening the exhibition, Malaysian Deputy Finance Minister Wong
See Wah said Malaysia is now one of the important production
centers for gold jewelry in the Far East, next only to Indonesia
and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government has since 1987 lifted the control on
gold trade and the licensing requirements. It has also abolished a
5 percent import duty on non-monetary gold in 1984.
</P>
<P>
To promote local manufacturing of high value-added jewelry,
Wong said the government has accorded pioneer status to such
industry under the Investment Promotion Act in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Wong called on all local gold jewelry players to put up efforts
to further improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the
industry in order to sustain continued growth.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysia jewelry industry has gained recognition for its
price competitiveness and quality and this is one of the reasons
behind the export penetration of the Malaysian jewelry into
Singapore, Hong Kong, China and Middle East markets, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia could therefore play an active role as one of the
trading centers to meet the huge demand of gold in Asia, which in
1995 was about 2,000 tons or 58 percent of the world's output,
according to Wong.
</P>
<P>
Only about 33-45 percent of Asia's demand is met by major
bullion markets in the region, while the rest of the demand is
sourced from the European and Australian markets, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Inflation Down by 2.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LAGOS, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's inflation dropped by
2.4 percent between July and August this year, with the annual
inflation standing at 13.7 percent in one year ending August#,a
latest report of the Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) said.
</P>
<P>
The FOS figure however showed a difference of 1.7 percent
from that of the Central Bank of Nigeira, which announced earlier
a 12 percent drop in inflation in August from 15 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
FOS attributed the decline in inflation to the recent harvest
season which led to high supply of farm produce to both urban and
rural centers.
</P>
<P>
However, it stated that "the level of prices is still very
high with retail prices of consumer goods and services still
experiencing increase."
</P>
<P>
In the 12 months to August this year, the average consumer
price level advanced by 3.6 percent, FOS said, adding that it
however was lower than 7.5 percent recorded in July.

Hungary can make itself more secure and latent dangers can be
averted if it joins NATO. The idea that Hungary should remain
neutral in international affairs is unrealistic, because it cannot
bear the cost of remaining neutral. Even if Hungary announces its

<HEADLINE> China to Build Grain Production Bases in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- China will invest 10 billion
yuan (1.25 billion US dollars) to build grain production bases in
the Ili River Valleys, the Ertix River Valleys and the Tacheng
Basin in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
These bases are expected to provide 5 billion kilograms of
grain annually.
</P>
<P>
Zahan Emaer, a senior official of the Yili Kazak Autonomous
Prefecture, made these remarks during an interview with Xinhua
today.
</P>
<P>
Zahan said that the project, now being built, will open up 5
billion cubic meters of water resources and expand arable land by
600,000 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Yili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture, located in the far northwest,
boasts rich water, land, solar energy and heating resources. The
prefecture has more than 1.7 million hectares of land suitable for
farming, with only 980,000 hectares having been cultivated so far.
</P>
<P>
Annual surface water runoff in the area stands at over 36
billion cubic meters, and natural grassland exceeds 20 million
hectares.
</P>
<P>
Zahan told Xinhua that the prefecture's grain output this year
is expected to reach 1.9 million tons, an increase of 60,000 tons
over 1996; cotton output is to reach 55,000 tons, up by 7,000 tons
over last year.
</P>
<P>
Similar increases are also expected in other farm produce and
domestic animal breeding, Zahan said.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income for local farmers and herdsmen is expected to
rise to 1,650 yuan (about 221 US dollars) from 1,475 yuan (about
184 US dollars) in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Junggar Increases Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Karamay, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Shixi Oil Field in west
China's Junggar Basin has increased its daily crude oil output to
over 3,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Shixi has thus emerged as one of the basin's major oil fields
with annual output exceeding one million tons, second only to the
the Cainan Oil Field.
</P>
<P>
The Shixi Oil Field, located in the Gurbantunggut Desert in the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, entered operations in 1996. The
field is expected to use advanced drilling, oil extraction and
automated production technology to increase its annual production
capacity to 1.1 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The Karamay Oil Field, China's first major oil project, was
discovered in the Junggar Basin in the 1950s, with a number of oil
and natural gas fields having since been developed in the region.
</P>
<P>
The 16 oil fields in operation produced 8.3 million tons of
crude oil in 1996, thereby leading the region's three major
basins in output.
</P>
<P>
The Shinan region, in the heart of the Junggar Basin Desert, is
home to proven oil reserves of some 93.73 million tons. Experts
note that the basin will most likely become the next focus of the
country's oil development program.

to promote a Cyprus settlement.
</P>
<P>
He said the great international interest in a Cyprus
solution is evidenced by the appointment of a large number of
envoys monitoring developments in the Cyprus problem, who express
support to the U.N. Secretary-General's efforts.
</P>
<P>
"We also have an indication that the U.S. are now entering the
process with Presidential Emissary Richard Holbrooke leading the
way," the President added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the U.S. is the only country which can
exert pressure on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton's Emissary for Cyprus will arrive on Monday
in Cyprus for talks with President Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles, Clerides
said the reason for the purchase of the missiles expected to
be deployed in Cyprus in mid 1998 was that the Cyprus' land
forces needed adequate air cover.
</P>
<P>
Clerides repeated that the missile issue can be discussed
within the framework of an agreement for the reduction of
armaments and the withdrawal of foreign troops, eventually leading
to demilitarization of the island.

<HEADLINE> China Holds Campaign to Stop Radio Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide check on
radio-paging stations should minimize radio interference with
China's airline communications navigation system, according to
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"Though the development of the country's radio-paging systems
is sound on the whole, some paging companies violated State radio
management regulations by establishing high-power transmitters, or
concentrated their transmitters on high hill tops, especially near
those for air communications," Li Deji, an official of the State
Radio Regulatory Commission, said.
</P>
<P>
The current campaign, which began in May, is focusing on the
huge number of paging systems already set up on mountains,
rectifying those arbitrarily using high-power transmitters.
</P>
<P>
On June 28, the 14 paging transmitters on Beijing's West Hill,
which posed a threat to the nearby Beijing airport, were removed.
</P>
<P>
Since radio-paging services began in China in 1985, more than
2,800 radio-paging enterprises have sprung up, serving 40 million
subscribers.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Investment in Fixed Assets Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, invested 79.62 billion yuan in fixed assets in
the first eight months of this year, 6.7 percent more than in the
same period last year, local sources announced here today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, 2,759 projects were under construction,
163 fewer than the number in the same period of last
year. However, the overall investment in new projects increased by
20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Large projects included a US-funded auto venture with
construction costs of 12.6 billion yuan to build, a
one-million-yuan subway line, and a power plant at a cost of 6.5
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
More investment was allocated for the state-owned firms than
for the non-public sector. The amount of investment in service
trades was higher than that in industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Pudong New Area was still a target for investment. In the first
eight months of the year, a total of 20.9 billion yuan, or a 46
percent rise compared with the same period a year ago, was
invested in fixed assets.

MAPUTO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique and Kuwait Fund
signed a 10 million U.S. Dollars loan agreement on Thursday,
under which Xinavane Cane Sugar Factory in Maputo Province will
be funded for its rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
According to local paper "Noticias" today, a total of 49
million U.S. Dollars is needed to rehabilitate Xinavane Cane
Sugar Factory which was damaged in Mozambique's 16-year-old civil
war.
</P>
<P>
Besides Kuwait Fund, OPEC Fund, the Bank of African Economic
Development of Arab and South Africa's Ned Bank/CCIC are also
involved into the rehabilitation project, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation will start in the fist half of 1998 and
will take three years. Then the annual production of the factory
will be increased to 47,000 tons of sugar from 10,000 tons at
present.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Minister of Planning and Finance Tomas Salomao said
at the signing ceremony that the agreement with Kuwait Fund is
part of efforts of the Mozambican government to revive its

<HEADLINE> Use of Hot Springs in Full Swing in Eastern China County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Wuyi County's profits from
fishery in hot spring water is expected to reach 300,000 yuan this
year as a result of the county's efforts to make full use
of its renowned hot springs.
</P>
<P>
Wuyi, located in east China's Zhejiang Province, is one of the
leading production bases of hot spring water in the country. Its
three major springs produce a total of 4,000 tons of hot water
each day. They are able to regenerate, and are refilled after
gushing.
</P>
<P>
Benefiting from the rich and stable local reserve of hot
spring water, the Aquatic Species Farm of Wuyi has opened ten mu
(about 0.7 hectare) of fish farms to raise tropical fish.
</P>
<P>
The farm produced 15,000 kilograms of fish last year, said Zou
Jianyi, who is in charge of the farm, and the fish have a lower
cost, a higher survival rate and are healthier than those raised
in ordinary farms.
</P>
<P>
The water in an ordinary fish farm is heated by boilers since
tropical fish cannot live in waters with a temperature under five
degrees centigrade. The water has a relatively unsteady
temperature.
</P>
<P>
The 1.2 million fries in the species farm accounted for half of
the total in Zhejiang, which is known as a "land of fish and rice"
in China, according to Zou.
</P>
<P>
Apart from fishery, tourism based at the hot spring resources
is on the working agenda of the county government because the
clear, tasteless and odorless hot water has a curative effect on
arthritis, skin diseases and cardiovascular diseases.
</P>
<P>
The county government has worked out a plan to build a spa able
to accommodate one million people annually.
</P>
<P>
Hot spring tourism of Wuyi has broad prospects, said Jiang
Yangjin, secretary-general of the county committee of the
Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
He added that his confidence comes from Wuyi's location in the
populous east China region which has a relatively developed
economy, and on the Jinhua-Wenzhou railway as the first major stop
from Jinhua.

<HEADLINE> China to Put City Planning Atop Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Governments at all levels in
China should put urban planning on the top of their development
agendas to avoid the waste of valuable land resources, today's
China Daily cited a government official as saying.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Riliang, an official with the Ministry of Construction,
said in an interview on Wednesday that the current priority is to
implement fully the State Council's 1996 circular on strengthening
urban planning.
</P>
<P>
For this purpose, the ministry has tightened the urban land-use
approval procedures, especially the planning and design check on
the land occupied, transferred or leased by various development
zones.
</P>
<P>
The emphasis of development and construction should be shifted
to further tapping the existing land potentials and exploring
non-arable land, according to the ministry's document issued
in October.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, for
example, will not approve new land to be used for real estate
purposes for the next five years, according to the document.
</P>
<P>
"Departments at various levels should provide help to, and
cooperate with, the urban planners and designers to fulfill their
obligations to design and manage the use of land in cities," said
Zhou, who is also a senior urban planner of the ministry's Urban
Planning and Design Department.
</P>
<P>
He said that in recent years, some localities, driven by their
own interests, have overstepped their authority to arbitrarily
approve or lease land to developers.
</P>
<P>
As a result, a considerable number of urban land plots were
kept idle or just barely developed, further deteriorating the
shortage of land for key construction projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, losses resulted from the dismantling of illegal
buildings amounted to 15 billion yuan a year, sources from the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou alone demolished illegal buildings totaling 250,000
square meters last year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ministry launched a nationwide drive to address
the problems.
</P>
<P>
Beihai City in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region
redistributed 13 square kilometers of otherwise idle urban land
and canceled a batch of development zones to extend the planning
and management on 433 additional hectares in the city.
</P>
<P>
In the island province of Hainan, the redistributed idle land
totaled 13,178 hectares in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The deliberate design of the precious land resources does not
conflict with construction development," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, high-efficiency use of land and redistribution of the
idle land have satisfied the land needs of the development of key
urban construction projects."
</P>
<P>
Since China's Urban Planning and Design Law was promulgated in
1989, planners and designers have contributed to the sustainable
development of urban areas.

<HEADLINE> Historical Monument to Be Erected with Damming of Yangtze (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 7 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow will
be a great day for the Three Gorges Project, since China is to
dam the Yangtze, the world's third largest river after the Amazon
and Nile.
</P>
<P>
This is hailed as the most exciting moment for the Chinese
People, and is expected to draw world-wide attention since the
project -- the world's largest hydro-power project -- demonstrates
that the feat performed by human power to conquer the Nature.
</P>
<P>
The river-damming will signal the end of the first phase
construction of the Three Gorges Project, and the start of the
second phase, when the gigantic Three Gorges Dam and power
stations will be constructed in a 630,000-sq-m lot on Yangtze,
formed by the two cofferdams.
</P>
<P>
The count-down to the exciting moment has begun, with the
dam builders busy making the final preparations for the
river-blocking.
</P>
<P>
At the damming site, the four dike-heads have already extended
into the mid of the Yangtze, leaving a 40 meter-gap in the
upstream cofferdam. Vessels are sailing smoothly across the
man-made diversion canal, where most of the river water is flowing
swiftly.
</P>
<P>
The imminent damming of the Yangtze will be the most difficult
one in the world, since the projected water flow rate and maximum
sectional water-depth during the damming process are 1.75 times
and 1.3 times that of the current world records.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, smooth navigation after the mainstream is cut off, and
successful implementation of the resettlement program for the
project are indispensable for the successful damming of the
Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
A 3,726-m-long man-made diversion canal was then dug and opened
to navigation a month ago, while the construction of the temporary
shiplock is also well under-way and expected to be put to use
before next May.

<TEXT>
<P>
Construction of an approach channel linking the temporary
shiplock to the main course of Yangtze also went ahead of
schedule, and is expected to go into operation next April.
</P>
<P>
The massive resettlement of displaced residents in the
reservoir area for the first-phase project posed as a bigger
challenge than the damming of Yangtze, since more than 30,000
residents have to be relocated and 116 factories moved before the
high-water season sets in next year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the resettlement work of the first wave of residents
have drawn to its end, with more than 90,000 of them already moved
out of their native places.
</P>
<P>
Successful completion of all these preparatory work are
giving a green-light to the final damming of the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
As a vital stage for the Three Gorges Project, the damming of
Yangtze signals the beginning for the profit-generating of the
whole project, since it will enable the power stations to be built
in the lot formed by the cofferdams on Yangtze. The project's
first hydro-power generating unit is expected to produce
electricity there in 2003.
</P>
<P>
But the comprehensive benefits of the whole project are beyond
the 84.7 billion kwh of electricity annually, protection of a
15-million-population and 2 million hectares of cropland from
floods, a boost to the economy in central and western China, and the
improved navigation conditions on Yangtze, since the impact the
project will have on the nation's economic and social development
is expected to be "far-reaching and immeasurable".
</P>
<P>
With the success of the Yangtze-blocking, the contractors of
the dam project are still expecting more difficulties and
hardships in the future.
</P>
<P>
But as a dam builder said, "there are no unconquerable
difficulties in the world and we are fully confident that the
Three Gorges Project will be completed in 2009 as a success of the
whole nation."

<HEADLINE> British Fibre Giant Plans to Set Up Plant in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 7 (Xinhua) -- British chemicals, paints and
fibre giant Courtaulds Plc. has selected India as the location for
its third "tencel" fibre plant, along with Indonesia, Singapore
and South Korea, a local newspaper "Business Standard" said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The British company plans to invest over 200 million U.S.
dollars to set up a unit with a minimum capacity of 60,000 tones
to manufacture the "wonder" fibre, the first new manmade fibre for
the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
The British company, which has set up two other tencel plants
in the United States and Europe, is likely to use a plant in India
as a base for supplying the fibre to the entire region.
</P>
<P>
"India is surely a key country in the running for our third
tencel plant in the world. But a final decision is to be taken
within a year's time," the paper quoted Courtaulds Director Peter
Rogers as saying.
</P>
<P>
Courtaulds had quit India over a decade ago after breaking off
from its Shalimar paints venture. It re-entered India through a
100 percent subsidiary color coating company two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Courtaulds has also shortlisted India for investments in other
fields like plastic packaging tubes, mostly used for health and
beauty care products, and acetate-based chemicals.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The political situation still
remains the major impediment to foreign direct investment in
Bangladesh, and this is the common view of the speakers who
delivered speeches at the on-going two-day investors' conference
in Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
If the political stability could not be maintained and the
impediments to the investment were not removed, the prospects of
investment in Bangladesh would gradually fade away, the speakers
noted, though the country had enormous prospects existed for
investment in the field of oil and gas exploration.
</P>
<P>
They emphasised the need for maintaining political stability,
improved law and order situation and removing the administrative
and regulatory bottlenecks that stood in the way of foreign
investment.
</P>
<P>
Being upbeat about the prospects of Bangladesh's economy, all
the speakers agreed that Bangladesh would be one of the most
potential and attractive place in the South Asia region for
foreign investment.

"Political instability, coupled with illegal toll collections,
has posed as the major impediment to great inflow of foreign
direct investment (in Bangladesh)," said Mieko Nishimizu,
vice-president of the World Bank (WB).
</P>
<P>
The WB deputy chief identified six other impediments that
blocked the country to be an attractive destination for large
foreign investment such as corruption, harassment of businessmen,
lack of a legal environment, over-expenditure by the government,
lack of adequate infrastructure and macro-economic situation.
</P>
<P>
Her view was fully supported by Francis Narayan, an
officer-in-charge of the Asian Development Bank. He said some
aspects made Bangladesh an attractive country for foreign
investment in medium to long-term view.
</P>
<P>
Narayan said the country also had some constraints to foreign
investment. "The economy has not been able to attract significant
amounts of private foreign investment despite serious efforts by
the government," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Besides political stability, he noted, there was a need of
sound economic policies, modern legal system, disciplined labor
force, and adequate infrastructure facilities especially energy,
transportation and communications.
</P>
<P>
"Political stability needs to be strengthened as frequent
agitation and political fractions can tarnish the image of the
country and make foreign investors apprehensive, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
A stable political system is a must for any investment, said
Syed Manzur, a renowned local entrepreneur. He stated that the
country, which has no ethnic, religious or caste problems, had
experienced a spate of hartals during 1995-1996 period, but "all
politicians are slowly realizing that this is suicidal".
</P>
<P>
The two-day investors' conference is scheduled to conclude
today.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Hopes ASEM Includes More Asian Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- More Asian countries should be
admitted to the Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) to balance the group,
Thai Foreign Minister Prachuab Chaiyasarn said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand will use its role as the Asian side's coordinator with
Europe to push for the admittance of more Asian nations into ASEM,
said Prachuab, who begins to serve as caretaking foreign minister
today after Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh officially
resigned at midnight Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Prachuab also expressed hopes that his successor will press
ahead on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The ASEM currently comprises 25 participating countries, 10
from Asia and 15 from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Australia, New Zealand, India and Pakistan reportedly are
seeking membership of the ASEM.
</P>
<P>
Senior Asian and European officials last week failed to set a
criteria for new members and agreed to leave the matter to their
leaders to decide at the ASEM summit in April next year.

<HEADLINE> President Kim Young-sam Withdraws From Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim
Young-sam will leave the ruling New Korea Party (NKP) today to
manage the presidential election in a "fair and stern manner,"
Presidential Spokesman Shin Woo-jae announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who founded the party in 1995, is presently the "honorary"
chairman of the party. He shifted the post to party presidential
candidate Lee Hoi-chang on September 30. He will present a letter
of departure to the ruling party later today.
</P>
<P>
"President Kim decided to depart the NKP Friday to fairly and
stringently manage the 15th presidential election and devote
himself entirely to administering state affairs," the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that President Kim will deliver a special
announcement to the nation on Saturday, December 18, the day of
the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Ruling party candidate Lee Hoi-chang had demanded the President
leave the party last month, but the president refused, saying he
can fairly manage the presidential election even staying in the
party.
</P>
<P>
The president's decision came among suspicions that he and his
aides support former Kyonggi Provincial Governor Rhee In-je, who
is also running in the presidential race. But they have flatly
 denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
After Rhee inaugurated the New Party by the People (NPP) to
help his presidential bid Tuesday, the ruling party and main
opposition National Congress for New Politics (NCNP) said the
president was not keeping his promise on neutrality, but
supportive of Rhee.
</P>
<P>
Rhee, who left the ruling party to run the presidential
election on his own after being defeated by Lee Hoi-chang in the
party's nomination race, is a former associate of the president.
</P>
<P>
Although the president and Rhee denied the charges, political
observers say it will be difficult for Rhee to escape from the
allegations given that Rhee's supporters are mainly followers of
the president.
</P>
<P>
The latest survey indicated that Rhee is rapidly closing the
gap of about 5 percent with opposition NCNP leader Kim Dae-jung,
the most popular presidential candidate, with an approval rating
standing at more than 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the poll, ruling party candidate Lee Hoi-chang took a
distant third place with less than 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> No Alternatives to U.N. Reform, Annan Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said today that there are no alternatives to reform within
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and
Caribbean in the Chilean capital, Annan said the world body should
adapt itself to the changing world instead of shying away from it.
</P>
<P>
He believes that after intensive discussions on various reform
programs in the current General Assembly, U.N. reform will be
conducted in a comprehensive way next year.
</P>
<P>
There is no doubt, he said, that the U.N. Security Council
needs reform, and the world community has reached consensus on it,
which in itself represents an achievement.
</P>
<P>
Any reform of the United Nations should be aimed at raising its
level of efficiency and representativeness, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of finance, Annan acknowledged that it is a hard
nut to crack, and that he is trying to persuade the member states
to honor their commitments unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
On human rights, he said we should base our societies on the
concept that basic human rights will be protected, which include
the right of development and the right to eat, to have clothing
and to receive medicare.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief arrived in Chile Wednesday on a two-day
visit. He will travel to Margarita Island, a resort off
Venezuela's Caribbean coast, to attend the Seventh Ibero-American
Summit.

UNITED NATIONS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today urged the Iraqi government to change its attitude
and cooperate with U.N. weapons inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in a statement issued here by the spokesman's office

no choice but to terminate the intervention initiated with the
dispatch of the mission and the matter would revert to the
Security Council," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Annan decided to send the mission to Iraq after Baghdad barred

HAVANA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Cuba plans to increase the use
of natural gas to save other fuels, a weekly newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban Oil Company (Cupet), which is trying to set a new

million cubic meters of gas this year.
</P>
<P>
Cupet President Tomas Benitez said that by the end of this
year, the extraction of natural gas must reach 50 million cubic
meters, which will save more than 50,000 tons of other fuels.

Cuba expects to boost production up to 200 million cubic meters
in order to save 20 million dollars in fuel.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Rebel Group Loses 4,358 Members Since 1994 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE) has lost 4,358 members since August 1994 when the
People's Alliance government assumed office, Deputy Defense
Minister Anurudha Ratwatte told the Sri Lankan parliament
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Local press today quoted Ratwatte as saying the figure was
released by the LTTE through its London office.
</P>
<P>
The casualties could be much higher as the LTTE seldom
discloses true figures, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister pledged to bring the government troops'
Operation Jayasikuru (Certain Victory) to a successful end. The
major military operation which began on May 13 aims to obtain a
70-kilometer-long transporting route running to the north.
</P>
<P>
The road is of vital strategic importance to the government.
Due to constant rebel assaults on land transport lines to the
Jaffna Peninsula in the north, the government has to rely heavily
on marine and airborne transportation which are quite costly.
</P>
<P>
The military said early this month that the troops had cleared
about two thirds of the road as the operation entered its final
phase.
</P>
<P>
The rebels of the LTTE have been fighting a bloody ethnic war
for a separate state of their own in the north and east of the
country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria's Foreign Trade Drops Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The last few years have seen a
sharp drop in Bulgarian foreign trade and the government must
come up with a national strategy for trade promotion, a senior
industrial source said here today.
</P>
<P>
Krustyo Stanilov, the President of the non-governmental Union
of Bulgarian Industry (UBI), said that UBI figures showed that
export and import of the whole country totalled only 9.96 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996, compared to 26.87 billion in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The downward trend remained unchanged in the first half of this
year, when foreign trade totalled 4.58 billion, much less than the
figure of the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The contraction of trade was attributed by Stanilov to the loss
of traditional trading partners. The country's trade with Central
and East European countries shrank sharply in recent years.

COLOMBO, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Over 3,000 families have been
rendered homeless by the fortnight-long thundershowers that have
inundated several parts of Southern Sri Lanka, a local Sinhalese
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Social Service Department, the worst affected
areas are Ratnapura, Puttlam, Kurunegala, Galle, Monaragala,
Gampaha and Hambantota districts.

<P>
While several low-lying areas have gone under water, many roads
have become impassable and telecommunications has been badly
disrupted.

The floods also caused extensive damage to rice and other
crops.

<P>
The Kelani river has risen nearly one meter over the spill
level, posing a threat to the suburbs of Colombo where several
houses have already gone under water.

<HEADLINE> Hungarian President Reaffirms Decision to Join NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Hungary has no choice but to
join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), President
Goncz Arpad said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hungary can make itself more secure and latent dangers can be
averted if it joins NATO, he said during a governmental workshop
on the country's decision to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
The idea that Hungary should remain neutral in international
affairs is unrealistic, because it cannot bear the cost of
remaining neutral, the president said. Even if Hungary announces
its neutrality, it has no way to defend its own boundaries, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that all political parties in the parliament support
the decision of Hungary to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Hungarian National Assembly passed a resolution amendment
last Tuesday, which decided to hold the referendum on the
countries' entry into NATO on November 16.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, together with Poland and the Czech Republic, was
invited to join NATO in the first wave in the Madrid Summit held
in July 8-9, this year.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Proves Soccer "Game for Green Grass" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea returned to the lush turf
from snow field to clinch a gasping 7-1 drubbing over Norwegian
Tromso Thursday and claimed a berth in the European Cup Winners'
Cup quarter-finals 9-4 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
The rampant hosts, who were stunned 3-2 in a snow-filled away
match when coach Ruud Gullit complained soccer as "a game for
green grass", started the spree with a 13th-minute header from
Romanian Dan Petrescu.
</P>
<P>
Gianluca Vialli repeated penchant in the first leg when he
scored a pair, found the net three times to give his side a
brilliant match to account.
</P>
<P>
A spectacular free-kick from Gianfranco Zola and a penalty by
Frank Leboeuf, alongside Petrescu's second, completed the one-way
goals to make a revenge for their first leg 3-2 defeat. Bjorn
Johansen scored the only goal for the visitors to make a brief
scare in the 39th minute.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, Germinal Ekeren of Belgium steered back from 0-2 to
take an astonishing 4-2 victory over VfB Stuttgart, but not enough
to make amends for a first-leg four-goal deficit.
</P>
<P>
The German side had Murat Yakin sent off just before the break,
joining Chelsea in the last eight winning 6-4 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Italy's Vicenza also progressed with goals by Pasquale Luiso
and Fabio Viviani to win 5-2 on aggregate after downed 3-1
Shakhtyor Donetsk of Ukraine in the first leg.
</P>
<P>
Real Betis of Spain held a 1-1 draw with FC Copenhagen of
Denmark through Juan Urena's header to ensure a 3-1 aggregate win
to advance.
</P>
<P>
The other four places in quarterfinals were booked by Slavia
Prague of the Czech Republic, Dutch side Roda JC Kerkrade,
Lokomotiv Moscow of Russia and AEK Athens as they beat their
opponents in Thursday's other matches.
</P>
<P>
The competition now takes a break until March.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Delay Gas Purchases due to Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic crisis has
taken its toll on the energy sector, forcing the country to delay
two major natural gas procurement projects.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had decided to delay plans to purchase liquefied
natural gas (LNG) from Oman by four years to 2007 from 2003. The
planned purchase of natural gas from Indonesia would also be
delayed.
</P>
<P>
The move was caused by lower-than-expected demand for energy
due to the severe economic downturn, caretaker Industry Minister
Korn Dabbaransi was quoted today by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Petroleum Authority of Thailand forecast that the demand
for natural gas, used mostly for electricity generation, would
drop by 15 percent from earlier predictions to three billion cubic
feet per day in 2003-2004.
</P>
<P>
Thai authorities see the country's gross domestic product for
1997 easing well below the 2.5 percent forecast earlier.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SANDOUPING (Three Gorges), November 7 (Xinhua) -- If Zhongbao
Isle resembles a big warship anchored in the yellowish water of
the Yangtze, the two cofferdams look like two giant hands about to
be joined up -- that is a panoramic view of the damming site from
a helicopter hovering overhead.
</P>
<P>
Overlooking from a helicopter 150 meters in the air, the
Yangtze mainstream to-be-dammed looks like a huge, imposing pool,
though streams are still bypassing through two gaps in the two
cofferdams.
</P>
<P>
Even before it reaches the cofferdam on the upstream, the river
water is diverted from the main course into a man-made diversion
channel off the southern bank.
</P>
<P>
As the roaring helicopter swept over the downstream cofferdam,
the reporters aboard saw an orange-colored belt in distance
running across the Yangtze, which is the newly-built Xiling
Bridge, the biggest suspension cable bridge in Asia.
</P>
<P>
At the northern bank, the Tanziling is erected as a solitary
ridge top that has been cut off vertically from its slopes, which
have been turned into ravines.
</P>
<P>
The southern ravine is where the temporary ship lock is to be
located, while the one to the north with five stages is expected
to be built into the biggest two-way and five-stage permanent
shiplock in the world upon completion in 2003.
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the buzzing worksite on the northern bank,
the scene at the opposite bank appears serene and peaceful.
Vessels are slowly sailing across the water diversion canal,
leaving long bubbled waves with spindrift behind them, against the
backdrop of eight eye-catching Chinese characters propped up with
steel plate framework behind, which read "Building the Three
Gorges Project and Developing the Yangtze" on the deep-green
mountainsides.

This scene will last till 2003, when the channel will, too, be

</P>
<P>
On the Zhongbao Isle in the shape of a warship stands a
concrete wall, which is expected to extend northward into a
185-m-high gravity concrete Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
The dense fog obscures the undulated and towering peaks further
away upstream, showing the might and benevolence of the Mother
Nature. On the dam site, a line of self-tipping trucks and other
heavily-loaded vehicles are shuttling back and forth, dumping
rocks and gravel on the river bank, while other heavy-duty trucks
and bulldozers were at some vacant lots, ready for use for the
final damming process.
</P>
<P>
The dam site is alive with a mood of festivity. A gigantic
five-star red flag spreads out as the backdrop of the review
stand, hemmed in by a sea of fresh flowers and potted plants.
Colorful balloons carrying long streamers with slogans to hail the
damming of the Yangtze are suspended in mid air all around the
Three Gorges construction site.
</P>
<P>
Leaving the site, the helicopter ascends at a fast speed to the
height of hundreds of meters from the ground, and the cofferdams
begin to dwindle into a shape of "V", as if a token bestowed for the
successful damming of the Yangtze on November 8.

which opened this week in China's capital city of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Located in Beijing Worker's Stadium, Blue Zoo Beijing covers an
area equivallent to a football field and houses some 5,000 ocean
creatures brought from all over the world including sharks, rays,
eels, piranha, coral reef fish, seahorses, sea-horses, starfish
and other invertebrates.
</P>
<P>
Blue Zoo Beijing is unique in that it has an education center
with a full-time teaching staff to tell children of marine life
knowledge as they tour the underwater world, said Graeme Osborne,
General-Manager of Blue Zoo.
</P>
<P>
Visitors can also enjoy lively shows of divers feeding fish and
sharks in a 110-meter transparent acrylic tunnel, the longest in

In addition, a moving walkway has been installed in the
underwater tunnel, which provides an effortless motion through the
"ocean," especially for senior citizens and the disabled.
</P>
<P>
According to Osborne, the aquarium is a joint venture project,
commenced in October 1996, between Beijing Workers' Sports Service
Center and New Zealand's Richina Underwater World Ltd. It also is
one of the largest New Zealand-funded projects in China.

<HEADLINE> Manila Allows Foreign Majority Ownership in Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has finally
agreed to open up majority ownership of local banks, investment
houses and insurance companies to foreign investors as part of its
commitment to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government's offer will be presented to the top
level financial services agreement negotiations under the WTO in
Geneva on November 10, local newspaper Manila Standard reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Under the package, foreigners will be allowed to take up to 60
percent of local banks' ownership by year 2002 but foreign equity
in investment and insurance companies will be limited to 51
percent.
</P>
<P>
The 60 percent ceiling on foreign ownership of banks will be
implemented on a staggered basis, with the current 49 percent
equity cap to be raised to 51 percent by 1998, and to 60 percent
by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has been more conservative in placing
commitments on investment houses and insurance firms as the
51-percent agreed ceiling was below those allowed by existing
laws, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At present, foreigners can own up to 60 percent of investment
companies according to a new law on investment houses signed by
President Fidel Ramos last month.
</P>
<P>
The report said the government wanted to preserve some
flexibility, and did not want to commit everything under current
laws of the WTO since it would be easier to amend domestic laws
than to withdraw WTO commitments.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank, for its part, is confident enough safeguards
are in place in the law liberalizing the entry of foreign banks.
One of them is the provision requiring banks to reserve 20 percent
of the banking system's aggregate resources to Filipinos.

BEIJING, November 7 (Xinhua) -- This autumn, like so many
before, people are flocking to west Beijing's Fragrant Hills to
enjoy the glorious red leaves. But to their disappointment, they
find the leaves are blighted with black and yellow spots.
</P>
<P>
The 100,000 red smoketrees which are growing on the hills,
luring 600,000 visitors each fall, have been hit by a plant
disease called verticillium wilt, experts said.
</P>
<P>
"It's difficult to find a single unaffected leaf," reported the
local Beijing Evening News.
</P>
<P>
"The trees have suffered from the disease for more than ten
years, but this year has been the most serious," said Feng
Guangsu, a worker at Fragrant Hills, adding that most of the trees
are more than 80 years old and vulnerable to disease.
</P>
<P>
The park has cut down the sick trees and treated the soil with
chemicals to control the spread of the disease. About 4,000 new
trees are planted every year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, experts have suggested that the park plant other
species of trees with red leaves.
</P>
<P>
To console the disheartened visitors, many pedlars are selling
plastic cards containing red-dyed leaves from a different type of
tree.

SANDOUPING (THREE GORGES), November 6 (Xinhua) -- China has
concluded its five-year payment of the 27-billion-yuan
construction costs for the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The figure is four billion yuan less than the budgeted.

<P>
All major work for the first phase, including
construction of roads, a canal, a temporary ship lock and
cofferdams, have met the set goals. Project quality has met
design requirements, while both static and actual investment,
which takes inflation into account, are strictly kept under
control.
</P>
<P>
Great changes have taken place in the Three Gorges Dam area,
which covers 15.28 sq km. The transportation infrastructure has
been completed, including a 28-km-long quasi-expressway, and the
canal is now navigable.
</P>
<P>
A temporary ship lock and a water diversion project at the
lower reaches of the Three Gorges Reservoir will soon be finished
and put into service. Large-scale digging for construction of the
permanent ship lock is moving along swiftly.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Peace and stability are vital
to the progress and prosperity in South Asia, Datu Ajit Singh,
secretary general of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN), said here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to the local media prior to his departure at the
Islamabad International Airport, Singh underlined the solution of
all regional disputes through mutual understanding and peacefully
for the benefit of the people of the region.
</P>
<P>
On the Kashmir issue, Singh, who arrived here Tuesday for the
inaugural meeting of ASEAN-Pakistan Joint Sectoral Cooperation
Committee (APJSCC), said that this issue should be resolved
bilaterally.
</P>
<P>
For peace and stability, he said, trust and confidence are very
important because through them "we are able to resolve whatever
issues we have in a very friendly way."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We have evolved a very peculiar or a particular ASEAN
way of doing things in which we are concentrated on seeking
consensus respecting each other's sensitivities and respecting
each other's independence."
</P>
<P>
Regarding the expansion of the ASEAN, he said that the
organization now has nine member countries and Cambodia will soon
join ASEAN, completing the family of ten.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the APJSCC meeting, Singh said that it was a
productive meeting. The meeting decided to establish the
ASEAN-Pakistan joint sectoral cooperation committee and this will
be the overall committee which will coordinate various issues
identified in trade, investment, industries, environment, science
and technology, tourism, drugs and narcotics control and human
resources development.
</P>
<P>
"We have also established an ASEAN-Islamabad Committee which
will consist of ambassadors of ASEAN countries based in Islamabad.
They will be our contact point with Pakistan and assist us in
maintaining contacts with the authorities here in Pakistan," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the third body they have established at the
meeting was the ASEAN-Pakistan Business Council which will be "a
very important body" for enhancing business and trade contacts
between ASEAN and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN and Pakistan attached high importance to trade and
economic issues, he said, adding "If we want to made any headway
or progress in this area we cannot do it without the cooperation
and the active involvement of the private sector."
</P>
<P>
He called for peace and stability in the region to enable the
members countries to concentrate their energies on development.

<HEADLINE> US Foreign Direct Investment Remains Stable: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. foreign direct investment
(FDI) flows remained stable in 1996 after a sharp increase of 80
percent in 1995, according to a study report.
</P>
<P>
The one-half percent growth in 1996 could be seen as a "healthy
correction" over the unsustainable expansion rate a year earlier,
said the New York-based Deloitte &AMP; Touche Consulting Group in its
annual study released here today.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, U.S. FDI into the manufacturing sector declined by 14
billion U.S. dollars while FDI into financial services grew by
17.5 billion dollars, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Asia Pacific was the only region that attracted more U.S.
manufacturing investment in 1996 than in 1995, the study said,
adding that Europe declined by 30 percent and Latin America
declined by 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The study also revealed that multinationals were increasing
their financial commitment to specific countries in the Asia
Pacific region, with Malaysia, Singapore and China being
recipients of more than 2 billion dollars in U.S. manufacturing
FDI in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Analyzing the investment trends, the study said that in face of
the currency turmoil in Southeast Asia, companies do feel some
turbulence but they are there to stay for a long term, with some
of them even taking advantage of the situation by acquiring
distressed local companies.

<HEADLINE> US Postpones Nimitz's Port Call </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it was postponing a scheduled port call by the aircraft
carrier Nimitz in the United Arab Emirates due to a rising tension
in the Gulf because of a crisis triggered by Iraq's barring of
Americans in the U.N. arms inspection teams from entering the
country.
</P>
<P>
Marine Corps Gen. Anthony Zinni, head of the U.S. Central
Command, decided to delay the call by the Nimitz, which carried
more than 50 jet fighters "in light of the current situation,"
Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"It was scheduled this weekend... it has been delayed," Bacon
said. "He didn'y think it was appropriate at this time for the
Nimitz to make a port call."
</P>
<P>
Bacon said there were some 17 U.S. warships including the
Nimitz, several capable of firing cruise missiles, and about 205
U.S. warplanes now in the region.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we are trying to send any signal to Saddam
Hussein right now except that `you ought to comply with the U.N.
mandates'" to scrap programs to develop weapons of mass
destruction, Bacon said.

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Drops Against Pound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 6 (Xinhua) -- A surprising rise in British
interest rates today made pound more attractive and weakened the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The dollar tumbled to a nearly four-month low against the pound
but was higher against the mark after Germany's central bank left
rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The dollar ended flat against the yen.
</P>
<P>
After the Bank of England raised interest rates for the fifth
time since May, traders bought sterling against a range of
currencies, pushing the pound to a five-year high against the yen.
</P>
<P>
The pound also strengthened against the mark as traders flocked
toward the higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
In New York, the pound settled at 1.6895 U.S. dollars, up from
1.6827 U.S. dollars late Wednesday, to reach the dollar's lowest
point against sterling since July 14.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also was quoted at 1.7234 marks, up from 1.7165, and
123.03 yen, compared with a six-month high of 123.07 yen Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4125 Swiss francs, up from 1.4032; 5.7715 French
francs, up from 5.7544; 1,688 Italian lire, up from 1,680; and
1.3975 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4002.

CANBERRA, November 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Governor General William Deane made an emotional
attempt yesterday to save reconciliation between indigenous and
white Australians from collapse, saying he would "weep for our
country" if the process failed.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Ian Macfarlane, governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia,
yesterday advocated lower wages growth and cuts to unemployment
benefits after a "search period" was completed as part of a
package of measures to solve Australia's chronically high jobless
rate.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- The jobless rate in the state of Victoria has fallen to 8.1
percent from 9.3 percent to be at its lowest level since December
1990, due to a surge in full-time jobs for men.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The Reserve Bank of Australia, the country's central bank,
is confident the Asian currency crisis will not weaken the
Australian economy enough to require another stimulatory cut in
interest rates.

<HEADLINE> US Gov't Warns Consumers of Dangerous Diet Supplement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration warned consumers today that some products being
sold as substitutes for recently banned diet drugs may be
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
The administration has informed a Pennsylvania company this
week that its products violate federal law and may be seized as
illegal drugs. Similar action against other companies were also
under consideration, officials from the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The diet drugs fenfluramine -- the "fen" in the popular
fen-phen diet combination -- and its close cousin Redux were
banned in September after doctors discovered tX damage dieters'
heart valves.
</P>
<P>
However, desperate dieters have flocked to blends of dietary
supplements that bear such names as Herbal Phen-Fen and Herbal
Phen Fuel. The FDA said that there was no evidence that the
dietary supplements contained in such remedies are effective for
weight loss.
</P>
<P>
Ephedrine can cause dangerous side effects that range from high
blood pressure and insomnia to seizures, heart attacks and stroke,
the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The FDA warned that companies are violating federal law by
advertising the dietary supplements as weight-loss products -- or
implying such a benefit by mimicking the prescription drug names.

<HEADLINE> Cohen: Iraq to Face Economic, Military Responses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William
Cohen warned Iraq on Thursday that it would face further economic
sanctions or military actions if it continues to bar U.N. arms
inspection teams from their work in the country.
</P>
<P>
"There is sufficient time to consider a whole panoply of
responses that could be considered by the United Nations. They
could include further economic measures. They could include
military as well," Cohen told reporters at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said it was imperative that "Iraq comply with U.N.
mandates," as it was not a "negotiable item."
</P>
<P>
"In the event that (compliance) does not take place, then
obviously the United Nations has a series of things it could
recommend.
</P>
<P>
Cohen also said the United States was awaiting a U.N. mission
to return and issue a report on the results of their talks with
Iraqi officials over Iraq's refusal of allowing Americans in three
U.N. weapons inspection teams to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq would not be allowed to carry out its intention of
removing Americans from the U.N. weapons inspections teams,
stressing that "the United Nations is united on this."
</P>
<P>
At the White House, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
after a Cabinet meeting that she had been discussing the three-man
U.N. team's mission in Baghdad with U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
"I've just been i touch with the secretary-general of the
United Nations getting a report on the delegation," she said.
"They are there delivering a tough message, and it's very
important for Saddam Hussein to understand that the international
community is behind the Security Council's very strong voice, that
he has to abide by the Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Vice President Al Gore said the United States would
not let the recent crisis be used by Saddam Hussein to violate the
U.N. Security Council's resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"We will make sure that he complies," Gore told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Saddam "must know that he has to comply with the will of the
international community, as expressed in these resolutions and
enforced by those, including us, who are undertaking to ensure
that he complies," he added.

<HEADLINE> Simitis: Positive Foreign Policy is Bearing  Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 6 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today spoke highly of his government's policy of active
initiatives in foreign relations, saying that such policy was not
only in tune with the demands of the times, but was also bearing
fruit.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of actived initiatives which we apply is already
bearing fruit in our relations with the European Union (EU). It is
bearing fruit in the Balkans, and it will bear even more fruit in
the sum total of the country's international relations," he said
while addressing Parliament's priority debate on foreign policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
He said that the new era demanded overcoming the traumas of the
past, it demanded new perceptions and ways of approaching the
major political issues, adjustment to the messages of the new
international reality, and initiatives in order to determine
themselves their new identity and developments in the area.
</P>
<P>
There were no ready roads to peace, they were carved out
through initiatives, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As for his meeting with Turkish Premier on Crete this week, he
said that their talks were "necessary, useful and positive."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey could talk without the mediation of third
parties, whose good offices may prove useful, but Greece ought to
render them unnecessary, he said, adding that they would therefore
pursue a continuation of contacts through the most appropriate
means."

<HEADLINE> Bonn Makes New Efforts to Reduce Greenhouse Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 6 (Xinhua) -- The German government today
approved an action program aimed at further reducing the country's
emissions of greenhouse gases.
</P>
<P>
German Environment Minister Angela Merkel said that the action
program would enable the Bonn government to come closer to its
announced goal of reducing the country's CO2-emissions by 25
percent from the 1990 level by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Included in the action program are stricter regulations for
energy saving and measures to promote the development of renewable
energy.
</P>
<P>
Without these additional measures, Germany might only be able
to cut its CO2 emissions by 15 to 17 percent by 2005, Merkel said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the new action program as "an important signal to
the world community," she also noted that Germany saw itself as a
world frontrunner in climate protection and would press for the
highest possible emission reduction target at the climate
conference in Kyoto, Japan, in December this year.
