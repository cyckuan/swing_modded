<HEADLINE> Albania Ready to Serve NATO's Logistics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Albania is ready to offer logistics
services with flight and landing facilities for NATO's display of
strength against Yugoslavia over the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Albania is ready to put its logistics at the disposal of NATO
and offers flight and landing facilities to its warplanes, as it
happened today," Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said Monday in
talks with Swedish Defense Minister Bjorn Fon Sydov, who arrived
for a one-day visit to Tirana.
</P>
<P>
NATO warplanes began air exercises over the southern Balkans on
Monday, designed to show that western diplomacy aimed at stopping
bloodshed in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo is backed by
military force.
</P>
<P>
The wargames came as fighting continued in Kosovo over the
weekend and Yugoslavian President Slobodan Milosevic prepared to
hold talks in Moscow with Russian President Boris Yeltsin aimed at
averting military intervention in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nano also hoped the bloc would reinforce its military presence
in Albania, which borders Kosovo where ethnic Albanians clashed
with Serbian authorities over independence from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's support for Albania's integration into the 15-state
European Union would help reduce tensions in the region, said
Nano, referring to the conflict which the international community
fears could spread through the southern Balkans.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish Defense Minister said NATO and other international
organizations would continue to follow the situation closely and
respect the deadlines given to Belgrade to withdraw troops from
Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARDIFF, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) finance
ministers Monday urged Japan to carry out further reforms in an
effort to restore consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
During the on-going EU summit which was opened early Monday in
Welsh capital of Cardiff, finance ministers from all the 15-nation
bloc said in a written statement that they discussed the latest
economic situation in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We noted the data published in Japan on Friday which showed
GDP falling by 1.3 percent in the first quarter of this year. The
economic impact of the recently announced fiscal stimulus has
still to come through," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The EU ministers stressed that it was necessary for Japan to
implement "further necessary structural reforms and measures to
strengthen the financial system to restore business and consumer
confidence.
</P>
<P>
On the latest developments in Indonesia, the ministers welcomed
Indonesia's statements committing itself to economic and political
reform and stressed the importance of both transparency and its
continuing "good cooperation" with international financial
institutions.

<P>
"We recognized the economic hardship faced by the people of
Indonesia and welcomed the humanitarian assistance being provided
by the European Community and member states individually," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The European ministers also voiced support for the Russian
government's economic reforms, in particular the reforms to
strengthen the tax administration and improve tax collection.
</P>

"We are ready to consider further conditional support for
Russia as necessary and appropriate," the statement said, adding

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Probe Alleged Torture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is working
out modalities for the establishment of an independent inquiry to
probe alleged torture of the detainees involved in the October 28
failed coup, Home Affairs Minister Peter Machungwa said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said here that the government has not abandoned the idea of
setting up the independent inquiry commission at an appropriate
time.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation to set up an independent commission of
inquiry into allegations of torture of the coup suspects by
police was made by the permanent human rights commission of the
country early this year.
</P>
<P>
Legal Affairs Minister Vincent Malambo also assured the donors
attending the Paris Club consultative meeting in May that an
independent inquiry would be conducted.
</P>
<P>
The police service was identified as the root cause of human
rights abuses and as such a vigorous restructuring and retaining
program will be devised for presentation at the next donors
meeting late this year.
</P>
<P>
At the Paris meeting the donors pledged Zambia 530 million
U.S. Dollars and additional funding once some governance and
human rights issues are resolved.
</P>
<P>
In another development, trial of 79 treason suspects of the
coup was adjourned for the second time Monday because one of the
soldiers is still recovering in hospital from an operation.
</P>
<P>
High Court Judge Japhet Banda adjourned the case to next
Monday, an application made by leader of the defense group for an
adjournment to allow Frazer Jere to recover from a surgical
operation carried out last Friday.

</P>
<P>
Under the terms of agreement, Bay Networks shareholders will

</P>
<P>
As a result, Nortel expects to issue about 134 million common

This represents a price of 38.21 per share of Bay Networks and
9.1 billion U.S. dollars for the entire transaction, according to
a statement issued by Nortel.
</P>
<P>
Bay Networks shareholders will own 21 percent of Nortel when

PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Despite the troubles England hooligans
caused at Marseille, FIFA official insisted that there was no danger
of England being kicked out of the World Cup finals.

England hooligans clashed with Tunisian supporters and French

Cooper also insisted that the hooliganism would not affect
England's chances of staging the 2006 World Cup finals:"I don't

<HEADLINE> SADC Energy Ministers Convene in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The energy ministers of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) Monday began their
23rd meeting in Harare on regional power policies.
</P>
<P>
The week-long meeting, being attended by ministers responsible
for energy from 14 SADC member countries, would map out how
investment can be maximized in this sector to boost economic
development.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy
Minister Enos Chikowore called on governments in the region to
come up with innovative financing infrastructures to ensure their
power utilities and the new entrants are able to satisfy the
every increasing demand for electricity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 percent of the regions population has access to
electricity.
</P>
<P>
"Due to low tariffs and poor performance of the utilities,
self-financing is generally weak... the foreign debt burdens
facing most developing countries and the fact that the
corporations themselves are heavily indebted makes this route
untenable," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that governments in the region should open up to allow
private sector participation and commercialization of their
respective power utilities.
</P>
<P>
Chikowore said it was pleasing to note that some governments
in the SADC region have started re-looking at their policies and
reviewing the structures of their utilities with the aim of
improving their performance and mobilizing needed financial
resources for development.
</P>
<P>
At the same meeting, Chief Executive Officer of Zimbabwe
Electricity Supply Authority Simbarashe Mangwengwende said that
demand for electricity was on the increase with the region
expected to use over 307,000 megawatts of electricity by the year
2020 up from the current 26,000 megawatts, most of which is being
consumed by the South African utility, ESKOM.
</P>
<P>
"We, however, need major investments in power generation in
the region and it is also important that decisions be made as
quickly as possible by our respective governments in this area to
ensure we get maximum returns," said Mangwengwende.

<HEADLINE> Britain not Invited to Zimbabwe's Land Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain and Germany said Monday
they have not received invitations to participate in the donor
conference on Zimbabwe's land set for June 23 to 25 although they
would be willing to attend.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which is to be a platform for Zimbabwe to
reassure donors that it will conduct its land reform in a
transparent manner, is sponsored by the European Union, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the British High Commission in Harare said his
country was "definitely willing" to attend the conference but had
not received any invitation from the Zimbabwean government.
</P>
<P>
"Once we are invited we will definitely be happy to attend. It
is important for the conference to succeed and our support will
come if land is used for the elimination of poverty," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, so far Britain had not yet seen the
Zimbabwean government's proposals on the land reform exercise.
</P>
<P>
At the German embassy in Harare, a spokeswoman said they had
also not received an invitation to the conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference takes place when the Zimbabwean government
having listed over 1,400 farms for acquisition for which
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said the government will only
compensate for improvements and not for the land.
</P>
<P>
Donors have, however, maintained that Zimbabwe's land reform
should be transparent and uphold the rule of law and should
benefit the poor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Burkina Faso last week, Micheal Camdessus,
managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said
the IMF would support Zimbabwe's land reform if the Zimbabwean
government put in place a system agreeable to all partners.
</P>
<P>
Promises to have resettlement started by June have also fallen
short due to lack of funds for the exercise.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece Coordinate on EU Bid: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus held "very intense
coordination" with Greece on its bid to join the European Union
(EU), a government spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Christos Stylianides made the statement at his daily press
briefing here while commenting on the EU summit which opened
Monday in Cardiff, the Welsh capital in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman declined to divulge any details of the
coordination, only saying that the two sides would iron out any
negative development following the recent statements on its EU bid
made by France, which is holding the EU rotatory presidency.
</P>
<P>
A French spokeswoman said last week that a divided Cyprus could
not enter the EU, suggesting the island's accession negotiations
with the EU be postponed.
</P>
<P>
The French statement indicated that France might raise
objections at the Cardiff summit to the continuation of the talks
with Cyprus because the Turkish Cypriots are not participating in
these talks.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides said the Cypriot government has taken necessary
steps following the French statement, and is waiting for the
conclusions of the EU summit before making any assessment.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, however, said Cyprus does not have any
information on the possibility of introducing amendments to the
text of matters relating to Cyprus' accession course.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus started its accession talks with the EU in last March
in accordance with a EU summit decision made in December 1997. But
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, who opposed Cyprus' EU
entry, has turned down an invitation from Cypriot President
Glafcos Clerides to nominate representatives to participate in the
accession talks as full-fledged members.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

CARDIFF, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) leaders
attending the Cardiff EU summit Monday afternoon issued a special
declaration on Kosovo, condemning the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia's (FRY) use of force against ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The European leaders said in the statement that the worsening
crisis in Kosovo "constitutes a serious threat to regional
stability and requires a strong and united international
response."
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders urged the Yugoslav government to stop all
operations by the security forces in Kosovo, enable "effective and
continuous international monitoring in Kosovo", facilitate the
full return of refugees to their homes and make rapid progress in
the political dialogue with Kosovo Albanian leadership.
</P>
<P>
On the meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic in Moscow on Tuesday, the
leaders urged President Milosevic to take advantage of the
opportunity to announce progress on the above measures.
</P>
<P>
"Unless these four steps are taken without delay, a much
stronger response, of a qualitatively different order, will be
required from the international community to deal with the
increased threat to regional peace and stability," the statement
added.

LUANDA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Britain has granted a total of 86
million U.S. Dollars to Angola through the European Union since

<HEADLINE> No-confidence Vote against PNA Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) agreed in Ramallah Monday on a 10-day delay for
holding its first no-confidence vote against the Palestinian
self-rule government led by Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The PLC decided to accept Arafat's request for the 10-day delay
"in order to give more time to Arafat to restructure the cabinet,"
the East Jerusalem-based Palestinian news service Jerusalem Media
and Communication Center reported.
</P>
<P>
Arafat on Saturday sent a letter to PLC Speaker Ahmed Queria
(Abu Ala), requesting the legislature to delay the vote pending
reshuffle of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) cabinet. The
reshuffle is to be completed by Friday.
</P>
<P>
On May 31, the PLC demanded the PNA further reallocate
the 1998 budget and resubmit it to the legislative body for
approval, or it will face a no-confidence vote in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Arafat promised broad political consultations
with all opposition parties on the reshuffle. He said he was
totally convinced that the cabinet change is part of the necessary
comprehensive administrative improvement of his government.
</P>
<P>
The four-day consultations are expected to start on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers have expressed growing dissatisfaction with the
performance of the PNA leadership, charging that it has not
carried out the long-promised reforms despite widespread criticism
of its high-level corruption and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has had promised to reshuffle his cabinet and remove
corrupt ministers, but no real actions have been taken before the
legislators threatened to table the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian legislature, formed in January 1996, has a
total of 88 members.

<P>
MASERILLE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- England head coach Glenn Hoddle was
delighted to see his team's performance in the match against Tunisia
which they won 2-0 here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Captain Alan Shearer scored in the first half while Paul Scholes
added one in the second half to give England their victory.
</P>
<P>
"That was a great start for us," said Hoddle, "It was a bit
anxious having to wait for our first match, but I felt we could have
had three or four and really taken them to the cleaners. But
overall it was a fantastic performance."
</P>
<P>
"I'm a great admirer of Paul, that is why I brought him into the
team so quickly once I'd taken over." Hoddle said.
</P>
<P>
Hoddle said:"A lot of good things came from England today and
Scholes was behind them."
</P>
<P>
Hoddle praised the England supporters inside the stadium:"The
support we got out here today was magnificent. There was no trouble
in the ground."
</P>
<P>
But during the match, clash broke out between England and
Tunisian fans on the beach of Mariselle.

<HEADLINE> "Cobra" Ilie Makes Deadly Bite for Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- "Cobra" Adrian Ilie made a deadly bite
here on Monday when his first half goal gave Romania a 1-0 win over
Colombia in Group G of the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Romania, quarterfinalists at the last World Cup in the United
States, clinched the victory through the Valencia striker in the
injury time of the first half.
</P>
<P>
Romania, who defeated the same opponent 3-1 in the United States
four years ago, gave the Colombians scare repeatly in the first 30
minutes with blasts mostly coming from Ilie and midfielder Dorinel
Munteanu of German side Cologne.
</P>
<P>
Ilie, who played as forward in the Spanish club up from his
midfielder position in former side Steauna Bucharest, finally found
the net a dozen minutes later, beating two Colombian defenders before
lobbing a ball home near the far post over goalkeeper Farid Mondragon.
</P>
<P>
The Romanians dominated most of the game but Colombia almost
equalized 15 minutes into the second half when striker Freddy Rincon
blasted a 20-meter shot that slided past the left pole.
</P>
<P>
Munteanu and teammates Dan Petrescu and Iulian Filipescu were
warned with yellow cards by Mauritus referee Lim Kee Chong.
</P>
<P>
Jose Santa of Colombia was also cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Romania will face England in their next game on June 22.

<HEADLINE> Give Chance to Peace: Ethiopian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said Monday that ''Ethiopia is committed to giving
a chance to efforts to peacefully resolve the crisis, even when
the chances are slim.''
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing Monday afternoon at his ministry, Seyoum
said, "however, Ethiopia reserves the right to take all measures
that it deems appropriate to defend its sovereignty and dignity,
including air strikes which will never target civilians or
civilian institutions."
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, an Ethiopian government spokeswoman
announced here that Ethiopia has agreed with the U.S. government
to temporarily halt air strikes. "We have agreed to an air cease-
fire but if our sovereignty is put under threat we will continue
to defend it," the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton Sunday appealed to Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi to halt air-raids with a view to giving a
chance for peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said at the news briefing that ''in accepting the
proposal by friends to suspend further use of air strikes,
Ethiopia has only demonstrated its wish to give the diplomatic
means a chance to deal with the dispute."
</P>
<P>
But, he stressed that "when Ethiopia is convinced that the
peace process has come to an end, it will immediately stop
observing the moratorium on air strikes."
</P>
<P>
Seyoum stressed that Eritrea must immediately and
unconditionally withdraw its forces from occupied areas. He
called for the implementation of the peace proposals submitted by
the U.S. and Rwandan facilitators, saying the peace proposals
"have received the widest possible support of the international
community."
</P>
<P>
Seyoum accused the Eritrean government of unleashing "a
campaign of terror against peaceful Ethiopian civilians residing
in Eritrea."
</P>
<P>
"About 600 are known to the Ethiopian government as having
been imprisoned, tortured and suffering the most inhuman
treatment," he charged, adding, "all over Eritrea, the
authorities have been herding thousands of Ethiopians in camps,
confiscated their property and personal belongings and dumped
them at the border."
</P>
<P>
In his replies to questions, Seyoum said Ethiopian Premier
Meles met and discussed with visiting Italian State Minister of
Foreign Affairs Rino Serri Sunday here on the crisis between
Ethiopia and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the discussion was on whether it is possible for
Ethiopia and Eritrea to declare a moratorium on air strikes, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Israel to Drop Hardline Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordan, one of the two Arab
countries that have reached peace treaty with Israel, urged the
Jewish state to stop its hardline policy so that peace talks will
be resumed.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister for Development Affairs and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad Anani made the remarks here
Monday after meeting the visiting Australian Parliament Speaker
Ian Sinclair.
</P>
<P>
He said the long-stalled Middle East peace negotiations should
be resumed on all the tracks in accordance with the
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with the delegation that arrived here on
Saturday on a three-day official visit, Anani also said Jordan
does not buy Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's excuses
to evade responsibility for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian-Israeli track of the peace process, Israel
should stop its hardline policy and soon resume talks with the
Palestinians after a 15-month hiatus, Anani told reporters.
</P>
<P>
As to the peace negotiations between Lebanon and Israel,
Jordan supports the Lebanese position and insists that Israel
withdraw from south Lebanon unconditionally in accordance with the
United Nations resolutions 425 and 426, said Anani.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, the Israeli government accepted the resolution 425,
but demanding security guarantees from Lebanese as condition.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks have remained deadlocked
since March 1997 due to Jewish settlements expansion in Arab East
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were stalled in February 1996,
as Netanyahu's government dropped the former government's promise
to return the Golan Heights Israel seized in the 1967 Mideast
War.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Leaders Agree to Seek Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the Burundi
government and all the opposition factions agreed here Monday
afternoon to begin sincere and peaceful talks in a bid to achieve
national reconciliation and end years of bloody conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya told the opening session
that his government likes to hold talks with all the opposition
factions and hopes this meeting, the first of its kind since he
took power nearly two years ago, will lead to a beginning for
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate and welcome the support by the neighboring
countries and the international community," he said at the Arusha
International Conference Center.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from Burundi's major oppositions and parliament also
made their statements, saying they have been tired of endless
bloody conflicts, and hope all the factions should shoulder the
interests of the nation and the people and seek lasting solutions
through sincere and serious talks.
</P>
<P>
Julius Nyerere, the international facilitator and former
Tanzanian president, expressed his thanks for the support from
Burundi, countries in the Great Lakes region as well as the
international community for his mediation.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere's mediation started in late 1996 after seven east and
central African countries imposed economic sanctions on Bujumbura
in August just a few days following a military coup by Major
Buyoya to topple a civilian government led by President S.
Ntibantunganya on July 25.
</P>
<P>
"I hope all the main actors in Burundi will forget the past
and greet a bright future," said the 76-old Nyerere.
</P>
<P>
Benjamin Mkapa, president of Tanzania which is the main
sponsor of the sanctions, told the Burundi leaders that despite
the suffering they brought to the Burundi people, the sanctions
will not be lifted until a genuine national reconciliation is
achieved in the tiny central African country.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni, Rwandan President Pasteur
Bizimungu, Zambian Vice President Christon Tembo and Kenyan
Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana all briefed the session which were
attended by some 300 Burundi delegates from various factions,
foreign envoys and representatives of the international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The leaders from countries which are for the sanctions urged
the Burundians to abandon the out-dated military coup and bloody
conflicts and to settle their differences in favor of the nation
and the people.
</P>
<P>
"From our experience, we know that nobody will win in ethnic
genocides and conflicts," President Bizimungu cautioned in his
speech.
</P>
<P>
Messages from the Organization of African Unity Secretary
General Salim Ahmed Salim and the U.N. Chief Kofi Annan were also
presented respectively at the session. The two secretaries
general said in their messages that they were inspired by the
gathering of the Burundi leaders and pledged support to a real
national reconciliation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi leaders immediately began their talks, mediated by
Nyerere, when the session concluded late in the afternoon while
Buyoya, Museveni, Bizimungu and others left for home.
</P>
<P>
Late last month, Nyerere met separately in Dar es Salaam with
all leaders of the Burundi factions including Leonce
Ngendakumana, the speaker of the National Assembly, Jean-Baptiste
Bagaza and S. Ntibantunganya, Burundi's former presidents, Jean
Minani, the chairman of the Front pour la Democratie an Burundi
(FRODEBU), and Leonard Nyangoma, the chairman of the National
Council for Defense and Democracy (CNDD), as well as Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the preparations to make the Arusha talks a
success which may lead to an early lifting of the economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture to answer the calls by the sanction imposers and
to ease internal tension, Buyoya, an ethnic Tutsi, signed last
week a new transitional constitution and named two vice
presidents including an ethnic Hutu leader from the main
opposition party to replace the Premier.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have died in
bloody conflicts between the ethnic Hutu majority and the ruling
Tutsi minority since the assassination of Melchior Ndadaye, the
first president elected under a multi-party system in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams Attempts to Prolong Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Monday accused the United
States and Britain of attempting to prolong sanctions on Iraq by
pressuring the U.N. Security Council to adopt a new resolution on
the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry spokesman was quoted by the Iraqi News
Agency as saying that Washington and London have ignored "the fact
that the oil-for-food program was an exceptional and provisional
deal" between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Under a 1996 deal with the U.N., Iraq was allowed to sell 2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food, medicine and other
humanitarian supplies every six months. The figure was raised
earlier this year to 5.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on reports that the U.S. is
pushing for indefinitely continuing the program as long as the
economic sanctions, imposed in 1990 after Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait, remain in place.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the U.N. Resolution 687 on the program, in
its third introductory paragraph, emphasizes that the program was
drawn up as a provisional measure, not a permanent one.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S.-British attempt to turn the oil-for-food
program into a permanent one could only be interpreted as their
intention to perpetuate the sufferings of Iraqi people by blocking
the lifting of the trade embargo on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Attacking the U.S. and Britain for pressing other members of
the U.N. Security Council to pass a new resolution on the program,
the spokesman stressed that Iraq holds that "any justification by
the council to pass new resolution is no longer valid."
</P>
<P>
He said the oil-for-food program has obviously failed to ease
the sufferings of Iraqi people as some hoped it would, adding that
it is high time for the U.N. to lift the sanctions since Iraq has
fulfilled all its obligations under the Resolution 687.
</P>
<P>
He urged "all fair and serious-minded members" of the
U.N. Security Council not to succumb to the U.S. and British
pressure and not to allow the draft resolution to be passed.

<HEADLINE> Blair Calls British Soccer Hooliganism "Total Disgrace" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Monday that the hooliganism of British soccer fans in
France was a "total disgrace" to the country.
</P>
<P>
At least 36 were injured when hundreds of soccer fans fought
pitched battles with Tunisian youths and police on Sunday night.
The violence erupted again on Monday during England's match
against Tunisia, and more than 60 people have been arrested --
most of them English -- since Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Fans watching the game on a giant screen on the Marseille
beachfront hurled bottles at one another and at least 15 Tunisians
had been injured by the time the game ended with a 2-0 victory for
England.
</P>
<P>
"The activities of those fans are a total disgrace. They have
nothing whatever to do with the best interests of English football
or our country," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"I think the whole of the country will unite in condemning
them."
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw also said on Monday the entire nation
had been punished by a "mindless, criminal, drunken minority."
</P>
<P>
Straw told the parliament he had telephoned his French
counterpart Jean-Pierre Chevenement to apologize for the
"disgraceful behavior" of England fans.
</P>
<P>
"I emphasised again our full support for the French police in
dealing swiftly and vigorously with those who cause such
disorder," Straw said.
</P>
<P>
Police and politicians had been hoping for a hooligan-free
World Cup as far as England was concerned after making strenuous
efforts to crack down on soccer-related violence at home and
placing travel restrictions on known trouble-makers.

LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- London travellers are facing
serious travel problems on Monday after a walkout by more than
6,000 London Underground train workers.
</P>
<P>
The strike on the "Tube", called by the Rail Maritime and
Transport (RMT) union over job security dispute, began on Sunday
evening and will run until late on Tuesday afternoon.

<P>
"About 57 percent of trains are running but that varies line by

The Tube criss-crosses the capital, incorporating about a dozen
lines and ferrying hundreds of thousands of people to and from
work every day.
</P>
<P>
"We would be surprised if London Underground would be able to
operate more than a 50 percent service," an RMT spokesman said.

Long delays on the trains forced many people to take to the

<HEADLINE> U.N. Envoy to Meet Angolan Govt, Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Blondin Beye, United Nations
special envoy in Angola, will meet with Angolan President Eduardo
dos Santos late Monday on the latter's plan for the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Beye will also leave for Andulo city in central Angola this
week to meet with Jonas Savimbi, chairman of the opposition
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), on
the same purpose, Francisco Noguera, an official with the U.N.
observer mission in Angola told the press here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Returning from the U.N. Security Council meeting on Angola,
Beye had called on Angolan government and UNITA, signatories of
the Lusaka Peace Accord in 1994, to redouble efforts to safeguard
peace and security in the country.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution last Friday
imposing new sanctions on the former rebel UNITA movement, which
include freezing UNITA's foreign bank accounts, restricting its
diamond export and limiting UNITA leaders' contacts with any
foreign officials other than the Angolan government and the U.N.
observer mission.
</P>
<P>
The resolution will enter into effect on June 23 if the UNITA
leadership refuses to implement the Lusaka peace deal till then.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Peace Process went into crisis when the UNITA
failed to hand over to the government the four "sensitive areas"
it has occupied in the central part of the country.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the Joint Committee on Angolan Peace Process
Monday on the current crisis confirmed that armed UNITA forces
are mobilizing in a large scale around the country, especially in
the north. The committee was "very worried" over the situation,
said Noguera.

<HEADLINE> French Troops Arrest Bosnian Serb War Crime Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- French troops serving in the NATO
Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia arrested on Monday morning a
Serb war crime suspect, Milorad Krnojelac, in Foca, southeast
Bosnia, in collaboration with German troops.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted French diplomatic sources in
the NATO headquarters in Brussels as saying that 40 French
commandos took Krnojelac by surprise in the operation carried out
in a zone under the control of French troops serving in the SFOR.
</P>
<P>
Krnojelac, accused of war crimes by the Hague-based
International Tribunal in charge of trying war crime suspects in
former Yugoslavia, was flown to the Netherlands where the tribunal
and a detention center for the war crime suspects are located,
said AFP.
</P>
<P>
The arrest coincided with the opening in Rome of an
international conference on establishing a permanent international
tribunal to judge people accused of genocide, war crimes and crime
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Over the past one year, France was accused by both the
International Tribunal in the Hague and the United States of
refusing to cooperate in arresting Bosnian Serb war crime
suspects.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Kazakhstan Tighten Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Kazakhstan have stepped
up their efforts to boost the trade between them, planning to
triple the volume in a decade's time.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev stated here on
Monday that he has ordered to outline such a project to increase
the trade with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev, who arrived here Sunday evening for a five-day state
visit, made the remark after talks with his Turkish counterpart
Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume between the two countries stood at 267 million
U.S. dollars in 1997 with over 300 Turkish firms operating in the
Central Asian state.
</P>
<P>
Turkish construction firms have undertaken projects worth
nearly 2 billion U.S. dollars and the two parties agreed on
continuing their efforts to encourage Turkish investments in
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Demirel said that "In the past six years (after
Kazakhstan gained independence), relations between our two
countries have reached such a level that normally could have only
been reached in 30 years."
</P>
<P>
"It is our primary objective to contribute to the
reconstruction and welfare of Kazakhstan," added the Turkish
president.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Turkish banks to show more interest in
operations in Kazakhstan, saying that a new 300-million-dollar
loan of the Eximbank will be allocated for the country.
</P>
<P>
The two parties also agreed to intensify cooperation in the
fields of oil and natural gas production.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president is scheduled to meet with Turkish Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Diamond Mining in Namibia Set to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Namibia could produce 2.25
million carats of diamond a year by the year 2000 should offshore
expansion plans of producers be successful, South African Press
Association quoted the Bank of Namibia as saying.
</P>
<P>
In its annual report for 1997 released Monday, the bank said
offshore diamond mining accounted for 44 percent of Namibia's
overall diamond production, compared to only four percent in
1990.
</P>
<P>
It said the next two years will be crucial in determining the
future of offshore diamond mining.
</P>
<P>
The country's onshore deposits of diamonds could be depleted
within 10 or 20 years, the report said. Growing offshore diamond
production, however, was expected to offset that decline, and
surpass onshore production.
</P>
<P>
It said that over the next few years Namibia would face the
challenges of Angola and Russia in the international diamond
market.
</P>
<P>
However, Namibia was uniquely placed in that it produced high
quality diamonds. Last year's average price for Namibian diamonds
was 315 U.S. Dollars per carat, compared to an average of 230
Dollars for Angolan diamonds, 140 Dollars for Russian gems and
105 Dollars for South African and Botswana diamonds.

<HEADLINE> 18 Suspects of Illegal Rally Freed in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Administrator of Lagos State in
southern Nigeria, Colonel Mohammed Marwa Monday ordered the
release of 18 suspects involved in last Friday's rally organized
by opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
Among the suspects are noted lawyer and opposition leader Gani
Fawehinmi and Dupe Onitiri-Abiola, wife of detained politician
Moshood Abiola.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Marwa announced at a press conference Monday that he
had ordered the dropping of the charges against the suspects,
arrested by police last Friday.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by the official News Agency of Nigeria as saying
that the rally is illegal because the organizer did not seek for
police permission.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he had decided to drop the charges against
the suspects in the spirit of national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the opposition groups in the country to give up
rallies and demonstrations and embrace the new head of state,
General Abdulsalam Abubakar's call for true reconciliation to
move the nation forward.
</P>
<P>
The rally last Friday was organized by the Joint Action
Committee of Nigeria (JACON) in commemorating the fifth
anniversary of the annulled June 12, 1993 election, in which
Moshood Abiola was widely believed to be the winner.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, numbering a few hundreds, were demanding
the release of Abiola and the end of military rule in Nigeria.
They were dispersed by the police using tear gas.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic arrived here on Monday for a working visit at the
invitation of his Russian counterpart Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic is expected to meet with Yeltsin on Tuesday morning
to discuss the situation around Kosovo, the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leader will insist on the necessity for
constructive dialogue between Belgrade and the Albanians living in
Kosovo and on the inadmissibility of using force, including NATO
troops, in resolving the conflict, said a Russian diplomat on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the diplomat, Moscow hopes "to persuade Milosevic
to seek steps that would prevent the settlement process from going
beyond political measures."
</P>
<P>
More than 250 people have died since the military conflict
occurred between government forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army
in February.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been voicing against any military settlement by NATO
to the crisis in the Kosovo region. To protest against the
alliance's military exercise in the vicinity of Kosovo, Russia
recalled its military envoy to NATO on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Uncovers Missile Launchers on Maltese Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Customs officials Monday
found seven mobile missile launchers suspected as parts of the
Russian-made S-300 missiles for Cyprus on board a Maltese
registered ship they stopped for checking.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency said the ship, named
Natasha-1, was intercepted in the Dardanelles Straits and received
an inspection of its cargo.
</P>
<P>
The Officials uncovered the missile launchers which were not
registered on the list of declaration during the inspection. A
Russian sailor was also found on board.
</P>
<P>
Ships carrying military equipment were required to inform
Turkish authorities of their intention to pass through the
Straits 24 hours before their passage, but no such application
was made by the ship, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said that a careful investigation had to be made to
confirm whether these missile launchers are parts of the S-300
missiles that Russia would deliver to Cyprus under their deal.
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Russian official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, reportedly said in Moscow that these missile launchers
had nothing to do with the S-300 missile deal. "The shipment of
the S-300 missiles has not started yet," he said, declining to
give details.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus clinched a deal with Russia in January 1997 to buy S-300
missiles worth 400 million U.S. dollars in order to increase its
defense capacity.
</P>
<P>
The deal, however, angered Turkey and Turkish Cypriots living
in the northern part of the divided island, who vowed to take all
possible means to prevent the deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since Turkey landed its troops and
took over the northern third in 1974 in the wake of an abortive
coup on the island seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from the United States and other Western
countries, the Cypriot government has announced that the S-300
missiles will not be deployed until October or November.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong opposition from Ankara, Russia has said that it
will go ahead with the missile deal with Cyprus because this is a
normal arms transaction.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Adviser Criticizes Starr Contacts with Reporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Whitewater Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr was again attacked by the White House after he
admitted in a magazine interview that his office anonymously
provided information to reporters in the Monica Lewinsky probe.
</P>
<P>
White House adviser Rahm Emanuel said the disclosure "goes
right to the heart of the legitimacy" of Starr's work and leaves a
cloud hanging over his office.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published this weekend, Starr admitted he
occasionally, and his deputy frequently, briefed reporters on a
not-for-attribution basis during the five-month investigation.
</P>
<P>
He said neither he nor the deputy, Jackie Bennett, leaked any
improper information, but left open the possibility they may have
provided detail about information they obtained from witnesses
outside the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Federal law prohibits prosecutors from disclosing information
gathered by the grand jury. The magazine Starr spoke to, Brill's
Content, went on to lash him for "leaking the most damaging
details of the investigation to a willing, eager press corps."
</P>
<P>
Starr said in self-defense Sunday, "We are living up to our
professional responsibilities."
</P>
<P>
The White House has repeatedly accused Starr's office of
leaking sensitive information to the press during the
investigation into whether Clinton had an affair with Ms.
Lewinsky, a former White House intern, and then tried to cover it
up. The president has denied any sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
The president's lawyer has asked a judge to sanction Starr for
alleged leaks. Presidential aides immediately seized on the
article.
</P>
<P>
"These charges are so serious and they go right to the heart of
the legitimacy of the office," Emanuel said Sunday on NBC's "Meet
the Press."
</P>
<P>
At issue for Starr is whether it is also illegal to disclose
what witnesses say outside the room -- such as in interviews with
the FBI or prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
Starr also acknowledged he and his deputy talked to reporters
from The New York Times just before they reported details of what
presidential secretary Betty Currie had told investigators.

<HEADLINE> 10 Percent Families Own 53 Percent Wealth in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ten percent of French families own
more than half of the private wealth nationwide, said the official
Council of Taxes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The council said that the concentration of wealth in a
relatively small number of rich families is an undeniable fact in
France.
</P>
<P>
Private wealth in France in 1996 was estimated at 24,500
billion francs (4,900 billion U.S. dollars), double that in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Half of private wealth are in the hands of those who are
engaged in financial business, it said.
</P>
<P>
Aged people, those who practise independent professions, senior
officials, and people with big incomes are the wealthiest in
France, said the council.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France is also among the nations which collect the
heaviest income and wealth tax, it added.

<HEADLINE> S. African Chemical, Germ Weapons Destroyed: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa said Monday its
chemical and biological weapons program had been terminated and
that all material which could have been used for offensive
purposes destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Material produced under the program had been destroyed in
cooperation with countries that had the necessary expertise and
in terms of international conventions, South African government
communications information services spokesman Joel Netshitenzhe
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The South African government was responding to last week's
revelations at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC)'s
hearings into the chemical and biological weapons program
initiated during the apartheid years.
</P>
<P>
The TRC is a special court authorized by the Government of
National Unity headed by President Nelson Mandela to investigate
all activities against human rights in apartheid era.
</P>
<P>
Netshitenzhe said the South African government practized a
foreign policy based on "friendly, humane and peaceful
engagement" with other nations and had no interest in developing
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"The government is also committed to ensuring that the
knowledge and expertise gathered in this area should, under no
circumstance, become available to any other country, individual
or companies," he said.
</P>
<P>
During last week's TRC hearings, evidence emerged of the
development of an array of toxic substances that could have been
used in offensive weapons. These included devices that appeared
to have been designed to dispense deadly poisons as a means of
carrying out assassinations.
</P>
<P>
There was also evidence of the generation of diseases such as
cholera and anthrax and the manufacture of large quantities of
illegal drugs such as Mandrax and ecstasy.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Angola and
Zambia Monday signed a letter of intent, restoring the
implementation of a bilateral agreement signed in 1989 to enhance
political and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Foreign Minister Keli Walubita revealed this at a
press conference after concluding a three-day visit to Angola.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the letter of intent is conducive to the
long-term peace and stability along their 1,650 km common border,
he said, adding that the Angolan government will make continuous
efforts to maintain mutual understanding and respect among the
two peoples.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, Zambia feels obliged to the
Lusaka Peace Accord signed between Angola's warring sides in
1994. The Zambian government will work as always to ensure the
complete implementation of the agreement and observe the
sanctions of the U.N. Security Council on the opposition UNITA
movement.
</P>
<P>
On the economic front, Walubita said the top priority is to
restore the railway between Benguela Province in central Angola
and Zambia, which is the shortest and most economic outlet to the
sea for his country.
</P>
<P>
Walubita arrived in Luanda Saturday for an official visit in
the country. The visit is believed to have eliminated
misunderstanding between the two sides and will help restore
bilateral relations.

<HEADLINE> Botha's Case Postponed to August 17 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president P. W. Botha's trial for snubbing the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was adjourned Monday until August
17 in the George regional court in Western Cape province.
</P>
<P>
Judgement is likely to be given the following day. If
convicted, Botha could face a jail sentence of up to two years or
a maximum fine of 20,000 Rand (3,770 U.S. Dollars), South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In his closing argument, public prosecutor Bruce Morrison, who
is Western Cape deputy attorney-general, claimed that Botha had
no legal excuse for ignoring a TRC subpoena.
</P>
<P>
Botha, 82, was brought to court after he had repeatedly
rejected the subpoena for hearings on the activities of the
former state security council, which he chaired in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Any objections Botha had to being subpoenaed by the TRC should
have been raised with the TRC itself, Morrison said, adding that
he could have alternatively applied to the high court to set
aside the subpoena or to review the TRC's actions.
</P>
<P>
"He has deliberately done neither. Subpoenas cannot simply be
flouted; they must be set aside by a court on review."
</P>
<P>
Morrison rejected argument by Botha's lawyers that the
subpoena issued against their client was technically invalid.
There was also no truth to the suggestion that there was an
agreement between Botha and TRC chairman Desmond Tutu, which
stated that the former president would not have to testify before
the TRC, he said.
</P>
<P>
Botha made an 1,800-page written submission to the TRC.
</P>
<P>
In their argument, Botha's advocates called for all charges
against Botha to be dropped.
</P>
<P>
They insisted that the subpoena served against Botha was
flawed and the TRC acted in bad faith.

<P>
BAGHDAD, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Trade Minister Ahmed
Gowaili arrived here Monday evening on a two-day visit aimed at
boosting economic and trade cooperation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit to Iraq by an Egyptian trade minister
since the 1991 Gulf War, which was triggered by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival, Gowaili told reporters that he would hold
talks with Iraqi officials on ways to promote bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Gowaili and his Iraqi counterpart Mohammed Mehdi Saleh will
meet Tuesday before inaugurating an Egyptian Economic and

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Militia Ready for Resuming Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the Taliban Interim
Council Sheikh Mullah Mohammad Rabbani said here Monday that he is
not against resuming the peace talks with rival forces that broke
off in May.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon his arrival here, Rabbani blamed
Taliban militia's rival, the Northern Alliance, for the failure of
the recent talks held in Islamabad, capital of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He accused the alliance, supported by some foreign countries as
he claimed, of offering conditions that were not in the interest
of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the Northern Alliance held their first
face-to-face peace talks in later April, but the talks were
suspended early May due to the sharp differences over the
ceasefire and prisoner swap.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani said the Taliban has no objection to the resumption of
the Afghan peace talks, adding the ball is on the other side's
court. "We left the matter for them to decide on. If they like to
negotiate, we will attend," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani rejected the accusations against the Taliban for
halting the Islamabad talks in order to launch an all-out attack
on the Northern Alliance's military positions. He said that the
Taliban movement supports the peace talks and has showed great
flexibility during the talks.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the Taliban, which is controlling 80 percent of
the country, has created preconditions on the number of the
alliance's representatives to the peace talks in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He also denied that the Islamabad talks were held under a
U.S. mediation. "The Americans have no role in the talks despite
the fact that a U.S. delegation visited Afghanistan during the
talks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bill Richardson, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations,
visited Afghanistan last April and reportedly sought to mediate
the peace talks aimed at restoring peace in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani pointed out that the peace talks were sponsored by
Pakistan, in which the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia
and the Organization of Islamic Conference all played a role.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani arrived here Monday on a four-day visit to UAE. He is
scheduled to hold talks with senior UAE officials on the latest
developments in Afghanistan and the ways of strengthening the
relations between the Taliban and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
The UAE recognized the Islamic regime of Taliban last year
after Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.

<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Romanian coach Anghel Iordanescu said his
team deserved the 1-0 win over Colombia in a group G game here on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I am very pleased with how we played, especially as so many of our

Iordanescu.

He added, "We had very many chances in the frist and were tired in

secure the win."
</P>
<P>
The team's star midfielder Georghe Hagi said he was happy despite
his failure to score.
</P>
<P>
"The important thing is that we won," Hagi said. "Nothing else
matters. We showed that when we needed to be, we are just as good on
defence as on attack."
</P>

Hagi said it was his last World Cup finals and he would do his best
to leave a good impression.

<HEADLINE> 2 Major Banks in S. Africa Increase Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Nedcor and Standard Bank
Monday joined other leading South African commercial banks in
raising their lending rates by two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Absa, Nbs Boland and First National Bank announced last week
that they were hiking their lending rates after the South African
Reserve Bank increased the repo rate.
</P>
<P>
The reserve bank made the move after its intervention on the
exchange market failed to shore up the Rand, which nose-dived to
record lows in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
It had been widely hoped that interest rates could be cut by
two or three percentage points to spur the economy.

KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Hajji Nasser Sebaggala, mayor of
Kampala City in Uganda, has been detained in New York city for
involvement in financial connections, Radio Uganda reported
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
The report said Ugandan Embassy in Washington, United States,

</P>
<P>
Local reports said Sebaggala was held by the U.S. Customs when

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has expressed his satisfaction that all the Burundi factions have
come together in the peace talks which opened Monday in Arusha,
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here after returning from the
all-inclusive peace talks on Burundi, the first of its kind since
a coup that toppled the legitimate government in Burundi in July
1996.
</P>
<P>
In his brief statement, Museveni also challenged all the
Burundi leaders gathered in Arusha to choose a correct turning
point in the political history of their country.
</P>
<P>
Museveni advised the Burundi leaders to consider cleaning the
ideology and the political process in Burundi and take the road
of empowering the Burundians democratically while guaranteeing
security for all.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi leaders should expunge notions of sectarianism and
replace them with notions of Burundism while bearing in mind that
Burundi is among the most ancient countries in Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
All factions involved in Burundi conflicts were represented at
the opening session which was chaired by former Tanzanian
president Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, who is also the facilitator of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Museveni left for the meeting Sunday, accompanied by Ruhakana
Rugunda, the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs in charge of
regional cooperation.

<P>
PARIS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Dutch coach Guus Hiddink said in Monaco
on Monday that he had written to international soccer body FIFA on the
matter concerning the send-off of Patrick Kluivert.
</P>
<P>
In the letter Hiddink explained the circumstances surrounding
Kluivert's dismissal in their Saturday game against Belgium, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the coach added that the squad must accept the striker's two

</P>
<P>
"He's been suspended for two games. It's at least one too many as
there were special circumstances," he said from the team's training
ground in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
FIFA's disciplinary committee said on Sunday that Kluivert, who
received a red card for elbowing Belgian Lorenzo Staelens, would be
banned for two games.
</P>
<P>
Kluivert had said Staelens had provoked him with some abusive

<HEADLINE> Alleged Palestinian Bomber Remains in Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian, alleged to be
responsible for a 1982 bombing of an American airliner, was
ordered by a federal judge Monday to remain in jail pending trial.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Attorney Ronald Walutes argued against bail in front of
U.S. District Court Judge Aubrey Robinson on the ground that
Mohammed Rashid, the accused bomber, was dangerous and skilled in
eluding law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
"He has no ties to this country" and would likely flee overseas
if released, Walutes said.
</P>
<P>
He said Rashid was the second-ranking officer in the
Palestinian group known as the 15th of May organization, which was
active in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Rashid, 51, was whisked out of Egypt earlier this month and
brought to Washington to face charges. On June 3, he pleaded
innocent in the bombing of a Pan Am airliner in August 1982, which
killed a Japanese boy and injured 15 other passengers.
</P>
<P>
Rashid has been in jail since his arrival in the United States,
and Robinson ordered him to remain in jail until a trial on nine
charges, including the bombing.

WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation Monday released the 12th edition of its annual
Emerging Stock Markets Factbook, covering markets for 75
developing countries and countries in transition.
</P>
<P>
The factbook tracks the rise and spread of the "Asian
contagion," which was the seminal event for emerging markets in
1997.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, emerging markets had 19,800 listed
companies, representing nearly half of world stock exchange
listings. Their combined market value of 2.3 trillion U.S. dollars
was equivalent to 9 percent of world market capitalization. Six of
the world's 20 largest stock markets were in emerging economies.
More than 2.7 trillion worth of trades were conducted in emerging
markets in 1997, about 14 percent of all world stock trades.
</P>
<P>
The factbook 1998, covering 1997 and earlier years, including
340 pages with chapters on basic economic data and key trends in
capital flows and stock prices, world stock market series,
detailed profiles on individual markets as well as IFC Index
features and results. There is a particular focus on the 52
markets covered in these IFC global, regional and industry indexes
and investable index of stocks available for foreign purchase.

MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia favors settling the Kosovo
conflict by peaceful means instead of methods which could worsen
the crisis, the Russian Foreign Ministry stated on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin said that it was
necessary to keep from "unilateral, provocative steps that could
push the conflict to escalation."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the international community unanimously agreed the
conflict should be resolved by political methods.
</P>
<P>
Moscow's approach to the Kosovo issue was consistent with its
attitude to the settlement of regional conflicts in the world,
Rakhmanin said.
</P>
<P>
Political measures were required to resolve regional conflicts
that considerably endangered the security and solidarity of the
international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday met with visiting
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to discuss the Kosovo
situation.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said that Milosevic had agreed to negotiate with ethnic

should be spread nationwide among young people to eliminate
illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will strenuously develop vocational education,
build several universities into first-level ones in the world and
form the basic framework for a new higher-education management
structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should guarantee that the increase of
financial input into science and education will be bigger than
that of financial income, and part of the extra-budget income
should also be put into science and education, Li stressed.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Calls on European Nations to Curb Hooliganism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- International soccer body FIFA called
for concerted efforts from the European countries to prevent the
spilling of hooliganism into the World Cup finals here.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA is not a police organization, we don't control frontiers, but
we would like to see measures taken to prevent troublemakers from
leaving their country at the time of important football competitions
elsewhere," FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "The hooligan problem in England is largely contained.
Problems occur when the English team are playing in another country
and that's why we would like to see the British government and the
European authorities take measures or strengthen existing laws."
</P>
<P>
Three English fans have been jailed for their role in riots at
Marseille before Monday's World Cup game between England and Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
However, Cooper said the English Football Association could be held
responsible for the behavior of English fans.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA has always been very satisfied with cooperation with the
English F.A. and there is no discussion of England being expelled from
this tournament or not being able to enter the 2002 World Cup."
</P>
<P>
CFO president Michel Platini, also commentng on the Marseille
violence, said he felt there would no longer be problems at England's
next matches against Romania on June 22 and against Colombia on June
26.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Governor of the State Bank of
Pakistan (SBP) Muhammad Yaqub has announced austerity measures in
the Central Bank in accordance with the Prime Minister's
directive, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A meeting held in Karachi Monday was attended by the chief

</P>
<P>

staff colony of the Bank shortly.
</P>
<P>
Yaqub has already surrendered one of the two cars officially
provided to him. He and his family have for over a year been using
only one car.
</P>
<P>
Under the new measures, sanctioning limits of Directors and
Chief Managers of the bank have been reduced drastically. No new
construction or alteration activity shall be undertaken, and all
purchase of items of furniture and fixtures have been halted.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU Environment Ministers Near Water Quality Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Environment ministers from
European Union countries on Tuesday unveiled an ambitious plan to
upgrade the water quality within the European Union in a timespan
of 34 years.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, who were able to reach a considerable degree of
consensus that will enable them to finalize a common position,
aimed at drafting a community-wide action plan for the protection
of surface water and groundwater in the 15-nation union.
</P>
<P>
But the environment ministers are still waiting for an opinion
from the European Parliament concerning the water quality issue.
</P>
<P>
All measures to achieve the environmental objectives for a
sustainable protection and use of water will be coordinated and
their effect overseen and monitored within river basins, the
ministers claimed, thus ensuring a coherent and rational way of
water application.
</P>
<P>
The water quality improvement plan in the making was expected
to be designed to provide an overall framework within which the
European Union, national and regional authorities can develop
integrated and coherent water policies and provide measures that
help to identify water issues that are not adequately addressed at
present.
</P>
<P>
But the water quality improvement plan has to cope with river
basin management, actions to combat accidental pollution and a
procedure for the development of coordinated strategies for
dealing with pollution by individual pollutants or groups of
pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The environment ministers admitted that to bring back to good
status the waters of the European Union after generations of
reckless pollution, a gradual step-by-step approach is needed for
inland surface water, transitional waters, coastal waters and
groundwater to be covered.
</P>
<P>
Though the ministers set a five-phase timetable of 34 years for
the implementation and completion of their water quality
improvement plan, some ministers argued that a pollution even
after having the pollution sources under control may take 50 years

<HEADLINE> Singapore, Malaysia to Conduct Joint Air Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Singapore and Malaysia will
conduct a joint air defense exercise (ADEX) in the airspace over
Peninsular Malaysia and Singapore from June 17 to 18, the
Singapore Ministry of Defense (MiD) announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
MiD said the exercise, codenamed MINOR ADEX 98-3, is to be held
within the framework of the Five Power Defense Arrangements (FPDA)
which comprises Australia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Headquarters Integrated Air Defense System (HQ IADS),
located at the Royal Malaysia Air Force (RMAF) base in
Butterworth, will serve as the coordination center for the
exercises and Air Vice-Marshal R. B. Treloar, commander of the HQ
IADS, will be the exercise director.
</P>
<P>
MINOR ADEX 98-3 is designed to increase the capability of the
air defense forces of the two FPDA member nations to preserve the
integrity of the Malaysian and Singapore airspace against a
simulated external air threat, MiD said.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, the aircraft and air defense
units assigned to take part in the two-day exercise include the

<HEADLINE> Experts Suggest Overall Arrangement on Rural Market Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A group of experts who have just
concluded their rural investigation urged the government to make
comprehensive arrangement from the macro point of view on the
development of rural market, which the experts found to have great
potentials.
</P>
<P>
In late May 12 investigation teams were dispatched by the State
Administration of Internal Trade to study the rural market in
different provinces and autonomous regions. Based on their
investigation, experts from these teams held that rational
development of natural, economic and social resources is the key
to developing rural economy and raising rural residents' payable
incomes.
</P>
<P>
They suggest that governments at various levels increase input
in agriculture, scientific and technological development service,
information service and water-conservancy infrastructure, actively
develop high-quality and high-efficiency agriculture, support the
development of enterprises that integrate trade, industry and
agriculture, and expand deep processing of agricultural and the
by-products.
</P>
<P>
The investigation found that the sources of rural residents'
income are increasingly diversified, the income from farming
constitutes only a small part of their total income, and over the
past two years the growth rate of farmers' income was sharply down.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in comparatively developed areas are spending more on
housing, cultural and entertainment activities, means of
communications, education, health-keeping and other aspects, while
farmers in backward areas spend most of their money on necessary
production and living materials.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that rural areas do not have sufficient
infrastructure, which restricts the access of modern consuming
goods to rural market. Efforts should be made to develop rural
public utilities and small towns in a bid to stimulate potential
purchasing power in rural areas.

<HEADLINE> China Bank Promises 850 Million US Dollars of Support to Local Airline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China is expected to
provide 850 million US dollars in financial support to the Xiamen
Airline Co. Ltd in the coming two years.
</P>
<P>
Under a cooperative agreement signed today by the two sides,
the Bank of China will provide all-round financial services and
loan support to the airline company in the next two years, with a
total value of 850 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1984, the Xiamen Airline is the first local
airline company in China. It now boasts 15 Boeing-737s and
Boeing-757s, operates 95 air routes with a total length of more
than 80,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Between 1995 and 1997, the Xiamen Airline reported an average
annual growth of 36.48 percent in profits and scored an average
annual profit of 224 million yuan. Its total assets has also
expanded from the original 20 million yuan to the preset 1.14
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Officials with the Bank of China hailed the agreement as
another important step the bank has taken to help jerk up the
national economy to realize an annual growth of eight percent.
</P>
<P>
In another two efforts to improve lending efficiency through
supporting large and profitable enterprises, the Bank of China has
signed similar agreements with the leading TV-maker the Konka
Group and top PC-maker the Legend Group this year, promising them
loan support worth 4.2 billion yuan and one billion yuan,
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Egypt, Belarus Agree to Enhance Economic Links </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Belarus and Egypt agreed Tuesday to
set up a joint committee on economic and trade cooperation to
enhance ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
This was reached by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, who is here on a
two-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the two presidents also reached consensus
on giving preferential treatment to each other's companies to
encourage them to launch projects in both countries.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said Mubarak decided to allow some Belarussian
products to be manufactured in Egypt, which would serve as a
springboard for marketing these items in Africa and the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Belarus can help in promoting Egyptian exports to the
Commonwealth of Independent States, such as Russia, Ukraine and
Kazakhstan, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko said major Belarussian firms have keen interests in
participating in a giant project being undertaken in Toshka of
Upper Egypt to reclaim thousands of acres of land, as well as in
the Technology Valley project in the Sinai peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"These projects will play a major role in promoting the
competitiveness of Egyptian economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Belarussian president singled out certain areas, such as
oil refining, pharmaceuticals, electronics, auto industry and
machinery, as the priorities for both countries to enhance trade
and launch joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
To encourage bilateral trade and joint investment, Egypt and
Belarus also signed Tuesday an agreement on operating a regular
air route between Cairo and Belarussian capital Minsk.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko arrived in Cairo Monday on a two-day visit, his
first since the two countries established diplomatic ties in
1994. He was accompanied by a large delegation of ministers and
leading businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Belarus is having a major surplus in its trade with Egypt,
which stood at 54 million U.S. dollars last year.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Gov't Not to Step in Airline's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Tuesday that it will not intervene in a massive retrenchment
program of the debt-ridden and strike-bound Philippine Airlines
(PAL) which will affect some 5,000 employees Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We can not just interfere in the internal affairs of that
private corporation although the government is a minority
stockholder there," Executive Secretary Alexander Aguirre told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Aguirre justified the PAL decision to fire the 5,000
employees, about 40 percent of its 13,700-strong workforce, saying
it is better to see the unemployment of 5,000 than that of 15,000.
</P>
<P>
PAL announced Monday that it has started to retrench 5,000
employees as part of a survival plan after an 11-day pilots'
strike brought the flag carrier to its knees.
</P>
<P>
PAL, which already issued walking papers to some 100 employees
Monday, said the retrenchment was covered by its collective
bargaining agreement (CBA) with its employees.
</P>
<P>
The retrenchment was triggered off by the ongoing crippling
strike by its 620 pilots who accused the management of invoking a
forced retirement policy in the CBA.
</P>
<P>
PAL, whose long-term debts alone amounted to nearly 10 billion
pesos (244 million U.S. dollars) as of March this year, fired all
the striking pilots and blamed the pilots' strike for plunging
into a deeper hole.
</P>
<P>
The airline said the cutbacks would allow it to recover
financially and to turn the airline into a more efficient
operation.
</P>
<P>
The airline said it has lost over 2 billion pesos (48 million
dollars) since the 620-strong pilots' union walked out on June 5.

<HEADLINE> GCC Oil Ministers Begin Talks on Output Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Oil ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) started their 21st session Tuesday
afternoon in Saudi capital Riyadh to unify stance on helping push
up oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are discussing production cuts and the situation
on the world oil market, the Kuwait News Agency quoted sources
close to the meeting as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are on their way to determine the reduction of
their shares, the sources said. But he did not give further
details.
</P>
<P>
The GCC ministerial meeting came amid moves by members and
non-members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
(OPEC) to further slash their output in an effort to shore up oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
The world oil prices slumped to nine-year lows in March due to
oversupply and the sagging demand, especially in southeast Asia
because of the financial turmoil there.
</P>
<P>
Major oil producers trimmed their output in April, trying to
boost oil prices. But their move has so far apparently failed to
help the oil market out.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico clinched a deal on
June 4 to decide to reduce their output by 450,000 barrels per day,
kicking off a fresh round of production cut.
</P>
<P>
The GCC groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, whose economy depends heavily on oil
earnings.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the GCC ministerial meeting will also
tackle a string of joint projects, including a natural gas network
in the region, and explore ways to boost gas trade with European
Union member states.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A Hong Kong leader Tuesday urged
Japan and the United States to take quick actions to stabilize the
yen, which has recently plunged to an 8-year low of 146 to one
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
In a media session after the Executive Council meeting, acting
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
Donald Tsang said here that the great volatility in the yen and
the U.S. dollar exchange rate has affected the economic
performance across the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
"We must urge the leading economies, particularly Japan and
America, to come forward to stabilize the situation. It is not
doing anybody any good at all," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The weakening of the Japanese yen has put pressure on the Hong
Kong dollar, pushing up interbank interest rates in Hong Kong over
the last few days.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said: "Continued volatility in the yen exchange rate
means that interest rates are likely to be higher than normal in
Hong Kong, and we still have to be very alert to what is happening
around us."
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed the government's commitment to the linked
exchange rate system, under which the Hong Kong currency is pegged
to the greenback at 7.8 HK dollars to one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
"It (the peg) is not going to change," he said, adding "in
fact moving the linked exchange rate now will create immediate
chaos and will bring havoc to the economy."

BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Cisco Systems, one of the leading
US suppliers of computer and communications networks and related
products, announced an investment plan involving 100 million US
dollars here last week, to accelerate its technology transfer,
senior managerial staff recruiting and cooperation with
communications service providers in China.
</P>
<P>
John Chambers, president and chief executive officer of Cisco,
said that the plan will also help the company to launch
partnerships with Chinese manufacturers and build more
laboratories and representative offices across the country.
</P>
<P>
Under this ambitious investment plan, Cisco will recruit 200
local employees this year to strengthen its operations in major
Chinese cities, including Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai and
Chengdu. Cisco is expected to double its China business by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Cisco will invest five million dollars in a
solely-owned networking technology company in Beijing, and one
million dollars in a network laboratory specializing in
demonstrating the latest networking technologies and applications.
</P>
<P>
According to Chambers, Cisco's China business revenues
increased by 200 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Chinese industrial analysts point out that the Cisco investment
plan should be taken as another signal that underscores the
increasing interest of foreign information technology industries
in China, in the wake of the onset of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese, US Scientists to Cooperate on Frontiers of Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China and the US will jointly
sponsor a "symposium on sciences at the frontier" in the US in
August to promote the cooperation between the two countries' young
scientists, said Xu Zhihong, vice-president of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences (CAS) here today.
</P>
<P>
CAS will select 60 outstanding young scientists from all over
the country to attend the symposium and discuss with their US
counterparts some hot scientific issues, such as using space
technology in geoscience, reducing natural disasters, protecting
water resources and analyzing the global climate.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that there is a harmonious atmosphere for cooperation
among scientists in some Western countries, where debates and
competitions are also encouraged. But such a good atmosphere for
scientific development has not yet been formed in China.
</P>
<P>
"The exchange and cooperation in sciences at the frontier with
American scientists may help Chinese young scientists learn
advanced experience in scientific development, such as
trans-subject cooperation and reform their traditional working
style," he said.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, the first of its kind for the two countries,
will be held once a year alternatively in China and in the United
States in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The exchanges and cooperation between the two countries have
developed rapidly since an agreement on scientific and
technological cooperation was signed in 1979, Xu said, adding that
CAS has participated in projects concerning high-energy physics,
and studies in basic science and global greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
He said such cooperation has improved the training of
high-tech personnel, especially young scientists in China. CAS has
sent 10,000 people to the United States to work and study, making
up one quarter of the total number of people sent abroad.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. National Academy of Sciences is to devote most of the
financial resources used for its international exchanges to
sponsor programs that bring together the most outstanding young
scientists of the two countries, who represent the future leaders
in science and technology in China and the United States,
according to Dr. Bruce Alberts, president of the academy.
</P>
<P>
"We view this as an important investment for the future of
science as well as for the future of a friendly and cooperative
relationship between our two countries," he explained.

<HEADLINE> Manila Maybe Understate External Debt: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has called the attention of the Philippines' monetary
authorities for "understating" its external liabilities, the
Central Bank of the Philippines said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF, in a report following its recent review of the
country's balance of payments and external debt statistics, noted
the need for the central bank to further expand its monitoring
system to include other loan transactions and other external
obligations which are not registered with the central bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the IMF, the non-inclusion of such external debts
results in an understatement of the country's true external debt
situation.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said the published external debt statistics appear to
be understated by 6 billion U.S. dollars. The central bank has
reported that as of end-1997, the country's external obligations
amounts to 45.5 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the central bank, in a statement issued Tuesday, tried to
downplay the IMF's observation.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said there was some slight difference in the
central bank's figures compared to those of the Bank for
International Settlements (BIS) and the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD).
</P>
<P>
The central bank explained that slightly higher BIS figures for
the country's short-term debt was admitted to be attributable to
differences in classification of certain accounts under the BIS
and Philippine systems.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines had been previously criticized by the
international community during the Marcos administration in the
early 1980s when former central bank governor Jaime Laya
sanctioned an understatement of the country's foreign debt.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Continuous heavy rain that has
battered central and northern Hunan Province since Monday has
disrupted traffic on the Zhicheng-Liuzhou railway. Two sections of
the Beijing-Guangzhou railway in the province have imposed speed
limits.
</P>
<P>
The torrential rain began on Monday evening and triggered off
mountain torrents which damaged the northern part of the
Zhicheng-Liuzhou railway line and forced it to close at 3
a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
Trains traveling on the Beijing-Guangzhou railway had to reduce
their speed to 45 kph due to some damages to the line.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government is busy with rescue work, and the
local transportation department has sent workers to repair the
damaged roads and railways.
</P>
<P>
According to local weather forecast, the heavy rain will
continue through June 19, and after a respite for one or two days,
the province is expected to have another wet spell.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The police station at the Chek
Lap Kok new airport is operating in full strength three weeks
before the airport opens for business.
</P>
<P>
A Hong Kong Police spokesman said here Tuesday the Chek Lap Kok
police station is now running at full capacity with all its 397
members in position, including 335 police officers and 62 civilian
staff. The station had only 88 policemen when it came into
operation in September last year.
</P>
<P>
Officers newly deployed to the station will familiarize
themselves with the 1,248-ha Chek Lap Kok platform by patrolling
the area, and visit various institutions and companies there,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, training on aviation security legislation,
overall airport operations, aircraft accident drills and counter
terrorist action will be strengthened," he said.
</P>
<P>
For the next three weeks, the Chek Lap Kok police station will
be fully operational in parallel with the Kai Tak police station,
which will be closed on July 6.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that police are confident to maintain
effective policing and public order at the new airport as they do
at Kai Tak.

<HEADLINE> Exhibition Highlights Chinese Lawyers (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China, the world's most populous
country, now has 100,000 lawyers, compared with only 212 when it
began its reform and opening-up in the lawyers system 19 years ago.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the statistics revealed at an exhibition which
opened here today. The exhibition, titled "Chinese Lawyers in the
Tide of Reform and Opening-Up", is the first of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
According to the exhibition, the total number of law firms in
China is now more than 8,300, from only 79 two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
"Lawyers and the lawyers system are not part of the Chinese
judicial tradition; they did not emerge in China until less than a
century ago," said Wang Li, a senior local lawyer.
</P>
<P>
However, she said, "the reform and opening-up has brought
springtime for Chinese lawyers.
</P>
<P>
"You may not know how many lawyers there are among the crowds
rushing to their offices in the morning, but the role played by
lawyers is now increasing dramatically," she said.
</P>
<P>
More than 11,000 Chinese families or individual citizens have
hired private lawyers so far, according to the exhibition -- and
the figure is expected to be doubled very soon.
</P>
<P>
"In the near future most Chinese will find that lawyers are
important in their lives, not only because they can help them win
court cases, but also because lawyers can help them avoid disputes
and help them earn more money," an expert from the All China
Lawyers Association said.
</P>
<P>
High-speed economic growth in China in recent years has
involved not only a number of large- and medium-scale construction
projects but also more and more foreign-related economic
activities. This is another area in which Chinese lawyers have
made great contributions.
</P>
<P>
According to the exhibition, in the largest Chinese industrial
city of Shanghai, lawyers have participated in more than 250
large- and medium-scale construction projects since 1993,
contributing much to the smooth operation of the bidding,
financing and contract negotiation of these projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1997 Chinese lawyers handled more than 25,000
foreign-related economic cases, provided consultancy services to
more than 1,200 overseas-invested projects.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing lawyers handled more than 100 financial cases last
year, involving over 10 billion yuan (about 1.25 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, according to experts, the lack of high-quality lawyers
who can deal properly with cases in some areas of speciality like
finance, securities and real estate is still a problem.
</P>
<P>
At present, only some 1,600 lawyers nationwide can handle cases
involving securities. These lawyers are concentrated in about 300
law firms.
</P>
<P>
According to the exhibition, about 11,000 government
departments and 118,000 enterprises have hired lawyers.
</P>
<P>
To suit the needs of those who can not afford the charges for
various reasons, China has so far set up 170 legal aid centers
which have handled more than 70,000 cases gratis or at reduced
fees.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Little Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
little changed Tuesday, at one point touching a new 12-year low of
58 U.S. cents before soaring as high as 59.05 U.S. cents as it was
dragged into the wake of a volatile Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
However, the currency closed the local session only marginally
stronger at 58.68 U.S. cents, from 58.59 U.S. cents in Sydney late
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rothschild Australia Treasury Manager Paul Macarounas said it
had been a "wild day" with most of the action in the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
"But the Australian dollar is basically back into neutral
ground," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese unit was pushed and pulled Tuesday as market
participants assessed the likelihood of the Bank of Japan (BOJ)
rushing to the rescue of its ailing currency.
</P>
<P>
Macarounas said Tuesday's solid end result for the Australian
dollar was likely to be only temporary as the bad news prevailed.
</P>
<P>
"All the negative factors are still in the market and the
Aussie (dollar) will continue to struggle," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will more likely see it test the record post-float low of
0.5710 U.S. dollar sometime in the near future," he said.
</P>
<P>
The currency reached that low on July 28, 1986.
</P>
<P>
Westpac Banking Corp. General Manager Bill Evans said the
Australian dollar was likely to push down toward the 0.5500 U.S.
dollar level before making any sustainable recovery.
</P>
<P>
Evans said there might be some temporary consolidation towards
the 0.5900 U.S. dollar level, but there was little relief in sight
on the Asian and commodity price woes that have seen the
Australian dollar lose 4.3 U.S. cents over the past month and 7.2
U.S. cents since the end of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the cross rates, the Australian dollar was also
buying 85.52 Japanese yen from 85.41 yen at Monday's close and
1.0588 German marks from 1.0614 marks.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Police Chief Says Will Not Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine National Police (PNP)
Director General Santiago Alino said on Tuesday that he would not
submit any courtesy resignation as head of the national police
force to president-elect and Vice President Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Alino was quoted by the official Philippine News Agency as
saying that although Estrada had the prerogative to designate a
new PNP chief, he would not submit a courtesy resignation, unless
he is ordered officially to do so by the incoming new
administration.
</P>
<P>
Estrada, the main opposition candidate who won the May 11
presidential poll, will be sworn in as the next president on June
30 to replace outgoing President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Under the related law, the position of the PNP chief has a
maximum term of four years and a compulsory retirement age of 56.
</P>
<P>
Alino, whose retirement age is yet in 2000, explained that it
would be the prerogative of the new president to replace him with
his choice.
</P>
<P>
"It's too early to submit a courtesy resignation. I have to
wait first for the decision of the newly elected president," Alino
said.
</P>
<P>
Alino said that in case he would submit a courtesy resignation,
he would still remain active in the police service.
</P>
<P>
The position of the PNP chief is not co-terminus with the
tenure of the president.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Say Expanding Education Can Solve Unemployment Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese sociologists have urged
that education be expanded to help solve the problem of
unemployment, which is acute in the country.
</P>
<P>
A report issued by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences says
that if the number of students enrolled by colleges and secondary
professional schools would be increased by 50 percent, and that if
the policy would be adhered to for three to four years, the
timetable for several million young people to enter the labor
market will be effectively postponed.
</P>
<P>
And the increase of the number of students means more job
opportunities, the report says, explaining that the lack of
skilled workers is a major factor to trigger unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chinese state-owned enterprises witnessed more than
six million laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
There are 25 college graduates in 10,000 people on average in
China, and the rate is very low compared with developed countries
and many developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The report says that the current policy of rejuvenating China
through science and education requires the development of colleges
and other schools.
</P>
<P>
It adds that in industrialized countries educational and
scientific sectors have become key industries to attract new
labors.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, the expenditure in education has taken a big
proportion in Chinese citizens' consumption structure, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
The major problem is that the underdeveloped education can not
satisfy people's demands of entering schools, the report points
out. It urges the government to reform the educational mechanism
established under a planned economy and to set up more schools
through various means, including private channels.
</P>
<P>
But the report doesn't say how to help college students find a
job. Statistics from the Education Ministry show that some 20
percent of college graduates this year are still waiting for jobs.
</P>
<P>
And more experts have said that education will not be
effectively developed if the overall economy can not become strong
enough.

<HEADLINE> China Vows to Strengthen Securities Market Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China will make continued efforts
to enhance supervision over its fledging securities market to
ensure stability and reduce risks, a senior securities industry
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We will further strengthen our supervision over securities
institutions in areas such as assets, trading practices,
personnel, venues and equipment, to protect the interests of the
investors," Geng Liang, vice-chairman of the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC), said at a meeting sponsored by the
Securities Association of China.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a unified supervisory system has been
established, as the People's Bank of China, the central bank, has
transferred its functions and responsibilities relating to the
securities market to the CSRC, the industry watchdog.
</P>
<P>
While the majority of Chinese securities institutions have over
the years scored considerable successes in business
standardization and expansion, some of them have accumulated a
large amount of bad assets due to poor management, with still
others having violated rules and engaging in speculation, Geng
said.
</P>
<P>
Official figures indicate that China currently has 327
securities institutions, which have a total of 2,440 operations
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee effective market supervision, the authorities will
combine on-the-spot supervision with other types of supervision,
with the focus on securities institutions with poor-quality assets
and great risk exposure, Geng said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the securities institutions to exercise
self-discipline, which is of special significance for the
high-risk securities industry.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 representatives from securities institutions
across China are participating in the two-day meeting.

MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government may post
a 40-billion-peso (976 million U.S. dollars) loss in revenue in
1998 following the renewed fall of the Philippine peso against the
green back, Finance Secretary Salvador Enriquez said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Enriquez said the outgoing
Ramos administration will likely leave the next government with a
cash budget deficit of close to 15 billion pesos (365 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
As of end-May, Enriquez said, the cash budget position of the
government continued to register a deficit of 15.5 billion pesos
(378 million dollars), much higher than the programmed deficit for
the five-month period of only 75 million pesos (1.8 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The government led by President Fidel Ramos has promised to
leave 1 billion pesos (24 million dollars) in budget surplus by
June 30 when it hands over the reins of government to
president-elect Joseph Estrada.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez said that the renewed currency turmoil fueled by the
sharp fall of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar has further
eroded revenue sources such as those collected by the Bureau of
Customs and to some extent by the Bureau of External Revenue.
</P>
<P>
On Monday when the yen plunged against the dollar, the peso
depreciated by more than 5 percent to a low of 42.45 to one
dollar. The peso was traded at an average of 41.77 to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez said the International Monetary Fund is aware of the
government's position and is not likely to take it against the
country in completing the review of the Philippines' economic
performance under a new loan program.

<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Vice President Taha Yassin
Ramadan left here Tuesday for Sanaa to pay a visit to Yemen as
special envoy of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan told the Iraqi News Agency before departure that during
his visit, he would deliver a letter from Saddam to Yemeni
President Ali Abdullah Saleh.
</P>
<P>
The letter centers on bilateral relations and Iraq's ties with
the United Nations Security Council and the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) charged with overseeing the elimination of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
It also touchs on Iraqi people's sufferings and its cause - the
eight-year-old harsh international economic sanctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq says it has carried out all the relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions and calls for lifting of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Only when the UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has destroyed all the
banned weapons will the U.N. Security Council lift the sanctions
imposed on the country in 1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ramadan said he would also discuss with Yemeni officials the
situation in the Arab world and issues of common interest.

<HEADLINE> 14,200 African Refugees Living in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 14,200 refugees from
other African countries are staying in Angola, dependent on
government relief and assistance, a senior Angolan official said
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Assistance and Social Reintegration
Eufrazina Maiato made the remarks at a press conference marking
the Day of African Refugees whcih falls on June 20.
</P>
<P>
Maiato said that of the 14,000 refugees staying in Angola,
11,800 are from the Democratic Republic of Congo, 2,320 from
Rwanda and 150 from Burundi. They fled to Angola from civil war
in their own countries.
</P>
<P>
Maiato said that the Angolan government is seeking every
possible ways to help these refugees, though the prolonged civil
war in Angola also created a large number of internal refugees
who are in urgent need for relief.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the Angolan government has worked with the
Office of the Representative of United Nations High Commissioner
for Refugees in offering relief in time to the refugees from the
three African countries to help them to survive the hardest
times.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the repatriation of the Angolan refugees staying
in other countries, she said that her ministry is working
actively in a bid to help the 300,000 refugees to return within
this year.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Assistance and Social Reintegration is
focusing on removing the land mines in the areas where the
refugees are to be rehabilitated, setting up reception centers
for returning refugees, reconstructing the infrastructures in the
refugee communities and rebuilding roads leading to the original
living places of the refugees, the deputy minister said.
</P>
<P>
During the nearly 20 years of civil war, a total number of
three million Angolan became refugees, 700,000 of whom fled
abroad.
</P>
<P>
So far, only 100,000 Angolan refugees have returned home.

<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter gave his
support to an African bid for the 2006 World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
It served as a blow to England's chances of World Cup bid
campaign, especially after two day violence caused mainly by England

"An African country would have a very strong chance of
winning the right to hold 2006," Blatter said.
</P>
<P>
Blatter said that as long as the country met the standards set
down by FIFA, then the sport's world governing body would favor an
African host for the 2006 World Cup finals.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Pharmaceuticals Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's pharmaceuticals
supervision authority has vowed to keep a close eye on the
nation's massive drug market in a bid to ensure the safe use of
medicines.
</P>
<P>
The newly-established State Bureau of Pharmaceuticals
Supervision and Management announced today that it will "enhance
technological supervision and administration of the research,
production, marketing and use of drugs".
</P>
<P>
The authority has the responsibility to draft rules related to
drugs administration, publish official drugs standards and decide
the catalogue of national essential drugs.
</P>
<P>
Registration of new drugs, generic drugs, imported drugs and
traditional Chinese medicines are also to be undertaken by the
bureau. In addition, it will conduct clinical research into drugs
and monitor adverse reactions.
</P>
<P>
Control of pharmaceuticals advertising, narcotics, toxic
drugs, psychotropic drugs, radio-pharmaceuticals and some special
medical instruments will be tightened.
</P>
<P>
A national report on examinations of medicine quality will be
published regularly, the bureau said, while pledging to crack down
upon production and sales of fake and shoddy products.
</P>
<P>
The authority plans to introduce a system of OTC (over the
counter) drugs across the country, as well as a certification
scheme for pharmacists.
</P>
<P>
The bureau and its workers must work under a "scientific, fair,
efficient, honest and clean" system in order to ensure that the
1.2 billion Chinese people use safe medicines, said Zheng Xiaoyu,
director of the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The bureau was established early this year as a result of the
Chinese government's efforts to streamline redundant governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
It replaced the former State Pharmaceuticals Administration, the
State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine and a
pharmaceuticals administration department under the Ministry of
Health.

JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Search and
Rescue Agency Tuesday warned the country's provinces against the
threats of abnormal weather phenomenon "La Nina," which may bring
heavy rains with high precipitation in November or December.
</P>
<P>
"Each province and regency should anticipate the impact of high
precipitation from now on, including possible floods in the next
six months," chief of the agency Harianto was quoted by Antara
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although the Meteorological and Geophysical Agency has yet to
issue information on the dangers of high precipitation, all areas
should take measures to deal with it, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should learn from the impact of last year's El Nino. As a
consequence of the prolonged drought, the condition of our forests
and farmlands became a cause for major concern," he added.

<P>
WASHINGTON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Stock markets plummeted in the United States and around the
world Monday as Asia's economic troubles deepened, prompting
urgent international calls for Japan to shore up its economy and
stave off a possible global financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
-- The roars of high-flying fighter jets rolled over the
mountains of Albania Monday as the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) staged a five-hour show of force aimed at
ending Serbia's military crackdown in the province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Two studies found that despite the U.S. economy's robust
growth, low-income families continued to face record-level
problems in the most basic of economic transactions: paying the
rent.
</P>
<P>
-- The Nuclear Regulatory Commission said safety conditions had
sufficiently improved at the Millstone nuclear power plant in
Connecticut for it to be restarted.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- China joined the U.S. and Western Europe in pressing Japan
to reform its economy and boost its currency, but Tokyo showed no
sign of taking action. Meanwhile, the yen dropped further.
</P>
<P>
-- Microsoft and Compaq invested 212.5 million dollars apiece
in the Road Runner service of Time Warner and MediaOne. Each will
take a ten percent stake, betting on the cable industry's ability

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Continue to Fall on Singapore Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to fall
on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) shed 3.88 points to close at 1,048.96 points on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, share prices recovered from sharp early losses to
close slightly lower.
</P>
<P>
Brokers said market sentiment was weak under pressure from
volatile currencies and rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Heavy selling of property counters, seen most vulnerable to
rising rates, pulled the property index down to a new year-low
before it rebounded slightly.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume increased to 148.48 million units,
valued at 270.34 million Singapore dollars (about 155.37 million
U.S. dollars). There were 81 rises against 232 falls while 275
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
DBS Land was the most actively traded stock as it registered a
turnover of 15.12 million units. It was followed by OUB F which
had 8.38 million shares traded. Informat was next with 6.44
million shares changing hands.
</P>
<P>
F&AMP;N, KepCorp and SingTel 100 were the top three on the gainers
list of the day as they rose by 0.06 cents respectively. F&AMP;N
finished at 4.20 Singapore dollars. KepCorp ended at 2.49
Singapore dollars while SingTel 100 closed at 2.19 Singapore
dollars.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Creative 50 was the biggest loser as it fell
by 2.90 Singapore dollars to end at 18.60 Singapore dollars.
CityDev w98 lost 77 cents and closed at 1.01 Singapore dollars.
Bukit Sem was next which shed 40 cents to finish at 8.00 Singapore

<HEADLINE> COMESA Moves to Expand Capital Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern and
Southern Africa (COMESA) has started to expand the capital base
of its PTA Bank to facilitate the economic reforms currently
conducted by most member countries.
</P>
<P>
PTA Bank President Martin Ogang said here Tuesday that the
capital base will be expanded from the current 400 million U.S.
Dollars to more than five billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the African Development Bank, the PTA Bank will focus
on making the private sector an engine for economic development in
Africa, said Ogang.
</P>
<P>
The bank president said that the bank's lending capacity to
the member states will be raised when the expansion process is
completed by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
After the expansion process, the bank will be able to lend up
to 300 million U.S. Dollars annually to the members, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank has lent over 100 million U.S. Dollars to Zambia for
various development projects.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Urges Japan to Prop up Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Finance Secretary
Salvador Enriquez Tuesday urged Japan to help prop up the Asian
economy by buying more exports of its regional neighbors which are
being affected by the new round of currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez made this appeal as the Philippine peso, which
followed the weakening Japanese yen to fall against the U.S.
dollar Monday, continued to remain weak against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
At the Philippine Dealing System, the peso regained strength
against the dollar Tuesday as the yen managed to appreciate. The
peso, which once fell to a low of 42.58 pesos to one dollar, was
traded at an average of 41.77 pesos to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign exchange traders said the market was still
jittery due to the unstable yen.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez said the "vulnerable" yen is the new "stimulus" to the
new round of Asian currency turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Japanese authorities to revise their economic
orientation by opening up their market to exports from its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Enriquez said that Japan has always protected its own economy
and not tried to take the lead in ensuring the economic strength
of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
This time around, he said, Japan should help revive the economy
of the region by purchasing more exports of its neighbors, thus
propping up their economies.

<HEADLINE> Hyundai Group Founder Enters DPRK on Foot by Crossing MDL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 16 (Xinhua) -- South Korean business tycoon Chung
Ju-Yung Tuesday morning entered the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) by crossing the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) on
foot at the truce village of Panmunjon.
</P>
<P>
"I am so happy to visit my hometown. I am so happy to go to my
birthplace in my car," said the 83-year-old founder of Hyundai
Group, who was born in what is now the DPRK's Tongchon, before he
crossed the MDL with his donation of 500 head of cattle loaded on
50 Hyundai trucks.
</P>
<P>
He had offered to donate a total of 1,000 head of cattle and
50,000 tons of maize to the DPRK. The rest of the donation will be
delivered after consultations on the route and schedule between
the Red Cross organizations of the two sides complete.
</P>
<P>
Supported by his sons, Chung went into one of the small blue
huts straddling the MDL at 10 a.m. (local time), and set foot on
DPRK soil, where a line of females in their Sunday-best welcomed
him with bouquets.
</P>
<P>
When Chung crossed middle line of the hut into the DPRK, a DPRK
official was heard saying, "You are really very welcome."
</P>
<P>
Outside, both U.S. and South Korean troops lining on the
southern side of the huts and DPRK soldiers on the northern side
witnessed the historic event.
</P>
<P>
Chung is the first South Korean businessman to have entered the
DPRK via Panmunjon, the place of tension and confrontation, a half
century after the division of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Before this event, Panmunjon had never been used as a route for
the intra-Korean private visits and transportation of commodities.
</P>
<P>
Chung, who had made another trip to the DPRK in 1989, said his
current visit was aimed at exploring tourism resources at Mountain
Kumkang and economic cooperation prospects.
</P>
<P>
In a commentary on the event issued Tuesday, the South Korean
Ministry of Unification said Chung's visit and donation are of
great significance as the use of Panmunjon, as a channel of
private visits and commodity transportation, will bring about an
atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation and an opportunity
for confidence building.
</P>
<P>
"The Republic of Korea government hopes the intra-Korean
exchange through Panmunjon will grow, " said the ministry.

ISLAMABAD, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Japan is determined to pursue
its initiative to push for a Pakistan-India meeting in Tokyo for a
solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute though it has been
rejected by India, said Japanese Ambassador Minoru Kubota here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kubota made the remarks when he called on Pakistani Foreign

and are convinced that the root cause of the tensions in South
Asia must be addressed as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his meeting with Japanese business leaders,
he urged them to not only continue but to increase their
investment in and trade with Pakistan.

Gohar appreciated the Japanese concern about the peace and
security situation in South Asia and stressed the need for finding

PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Marseille Jean-Claude
Gaudin said on Tuesday that all the English football hooligans who
rampaged through his city Sunday and Monday came down by cars.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the daily France Soir, Gaudin said that
for all the 10,000 English fans who came by trains, everything
went on peacefully and well.
</P>
<P>
"All the evil, as I told Prince Andrew yesterday at the

there was not incident at the screen in the northern district and
it was at the Prado beach which police said was easier to
control," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is a miracle that the northern district, where
live a great North African community, had not been put in flame.
</P>
<P>
Gaudin said that he regretted that after the primary incidents
took place on Sunday night, Marseille did not give a image as a
"city under siege."
</P>
<P>
"I told Dominique Baudis (mayor of Toulouse) and the
Toulousians who will host the next match of English: You should
criss-cross the town and take initiatives," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that he would ask the British government to
compensate for the loss inflicted upon Marseille by the
hooligans.

NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee and his Bangladesh counterpart, Sheikh Hasina,
held wide-ranging talks here Tuesday on matters of mutual interest
for boosting the ties between their two countries, official
sources said here.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee held one-to-one talks with Hasina, who arrived here
Tuesday morning on a one-day visit to India, followed by
delegation-level discussions on issues covering trade, investment,
tariff concessions and cooperation in various fields, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
Hasina is the first chief of government to visit India after it
conducted five underground nuclear tests on May 11 and 13 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after her arrival, Hasina had a meeting with India's
former Prime Minister I. K. Gujral, who established good
neighborly relations with India's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the Indian Foreign Office said here Monday that
Hasina's visit had nothing to do with Indo-Pakistan relations and
it was purely a bilateral event. India is opposed to any third
party mediation in Indo-Pak matters.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Nets $660,000 from Tobacco Sales </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has netted over 660,000
U.S. Dollars this year from tobacco sales but prices are lower
than expected, according to Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
The Tobacco Association of Zambia officials said that about
half a million kilograms of Virginia tobacco have been sold at
the Lusaka auction floor at the total value of about 636,000
Dollars at an average price of 1.2 dollars per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
As much as 24,000 kilograms of Barley tobacco were sold with a
value of 27,000 Dollars at an average price of 1.13 Dollars per
kilogram.
</P>
<P>
However, the country tobacco farmers expected this year's
tobacco prices to be 10 percent higher than last year and fear
that the low prices may tempt the emerging farmers who have since
diversified into tobacco growing to either cut back on output or
abandon the venture altogether, the weekly newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the farmers said production cost of tobacco now at one
Dollar per kilogram gives them negligible profit margins at
current tobacco sales and only hoped that prices do increase to
avoid a likely reduction in tobacco production in the 1998/99
season.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zimbabwe, the third largest tobacco exporter after
Brazil and the United States, initially recorded low tobacco
prices but its prices have now risen to 1.58 Dollars per kilogram
as at last Thursday, 0.29 Dollars less than expected 1.87
Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Albania Congratulates NATO Air Exercises Near Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Albania Monday congratulated the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on its air exercises
conducted in Albanian air space near Kosovo Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday evening, the Albanian government
said NATO's air exercises indicated the common aspiration of the
international community, in particular NATO member countries, not
to allow Kosovo becoming a second Bosnia-Herzegovina, according to
local media Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said if diplomatic efforts turn out to be
unsuccessful, NATO should use its good offices to resolve the
Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Swedish Defense Minister Bjorn Von Sydov Monday
evening, Albanian Prime Minister Fatos Nano said that Albania was
ready to make all logistics facilities available to the NATO
exercises.
</P>
<P>
Over 80 warplanes from 13 of the 16 NATO countries Monday
morning took part in the air exercises in Albanian and Macedonian
air spaces adjacent to Kosovo, aimed at exerting pressure on the
Yugoslav government to halt the violence in kosovo, a Yugoslavian
province with an ethnic Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have been killed and some 65,000 people
become refugees since the Serb-led government of the Yugoslav
federation began "a military crackdown" on ethnic Albanians'
independence movement in Kosovo early this year.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Mortality Remains High in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Despite the efforts being made to
fight HIV/AIDS in Africa, the mortality and morbidity rates of
the pandemic remain high in the continent, the World Health
Organization (WHO) has said.
</P>
<P>
Regional WHO Director for Africa Ephraim Samba was quoted by
Times of Zambia as saying here Monday that Africa with only 10
percent of the world population currently has 70 percent of the
20.8 million global cases of the HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"Every country on the continent has to a lesser or larger
degree reported cases of HIV/AIDS which every day infects 7,500
Africans out of the global total of 16,000 daily infections," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Samba said by the end of 1997 about nine million adults and
1.5 million children have developed AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Of these about seven million children and adults were said to
have already died.
</P>
<P>
He said the most vulnerable groups have been from Africa's
most active and productive people aged between 15 to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
"The results have been a weakening productive base, a growing
orphan population, further strains on already under-staffed and
under-funded health service across the continent and the adverse
consequences of all these on the quality of life of Africans,"
Samba said.
</P>
<P>
Factors accounting for this grim situation include the wide
practice of unprotected sex, high fertility, high incidence of
sexually transmitted diseases and poor access to care and
information, said Samba.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Official Warns of Harms of Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The computer's year 2000 problem
poses a real challenge as only 18 months are left to deal with it
before the immutable deadline, a Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) official warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The year 2000 problem can lead to potentially disastrous
results if not properly addressed," Deputy Secretary for
Information Technology and Broadcasting Jessie Ting said. "In a
worst case scenario, it could cause a complete shutdown of all the
operations. So don't leave anything to chance."
</P>
<P>
"The sooner you get started with your year 2000 project, the
sooner potential problems can be identified and actions taken to
avert them. The key is: act now," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ting was speaking at a seminar on the year 2000 problem and its
implications for buildings, facilities and security systems
organized by Hongkong Institute of Engineers and International
Facility Management Association (Hong Kong Chapter) here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The seminar provides a useful forum for experts of different
disciplines to discuss with buildings and facilities managers how
the year 2000 problem should be tackled in a holistic manner, she
said. "It drives home the message that the year 2000 problem is
not just a technical problem which can be left to the technicians
to resolve."
</P>
<P>
Safeguarding operational continuity is the prime driving force
behind the SAR government's comprehensive year 2000 compliance
program, which aims to avoid any disruption in the delivery of
public services when the new millennium arrives, Ting said.
</P>
<P>
And a high-level inter-departmental steering committee on the
issue has been set up and it has drawn up a three-pronged approach
to tackle the problem.
</P>
<P>
Ever since late 1996, year 2000 compliance requirement has been
included in all the new procurement of IT systems and equipment of
the government, Ting noted.
</P>
<P>
For all those systems and equipment which were put in place or
acquired before late 1996, a comprehensive rectification and
replacement program has been embarked to ensure year 2000
compliance. Every department has now developed a year 2000
rectification plan and action timetable, with progress being
closely monitored by the steering committee, according to Ting.
</P>
<P>
At present, she said, over 50 percent of the government's
existing systems and equipment are already year 2000 compliant and
the remainder are expected to achieve compliance well within 1999.
</P>
<P>
A series of publicity programs have been worked out to promote
awareness and encourage businesses in the private sector to take
early action.
</P>
<P>
The world faces an extremely tight time frame for dealing with
the year 2000 implications for embedded systems, which are the
core concern of buildings and facilities managers, she said. "We
have to work closely with the suppliers or manufacturers both in
assessing and fixing the problem."

<HEADLINE> Big Companies Hesitant to Commit to Public Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A new study shows that big
companies are still hesitant to commit to public Internet because
of concerns about its reliability and security.
</P>
<P>
Without a common set of specifications, technologies and
products which guarantee a level of security and reliability
businesses require, the Internet may simply become an interesting
public access network, International Data Corp.(IDC) said in a
report released on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The information technology market researcher surveyed an
unidentified number of multinational corporations, including those
in retail, financial services, telecommunications, computer
equipment and mail-order industries. Each of them employed more
than 19,000 workers, with average annual revenues of 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the study, there has been a tremendous return on
investment for companies that have developed intranets, in-house
Web sites that serve the employees of the enterprises, and
extranet, Web sites for existing customers rather than the general
public, to reduce costs and increase productivity. Meanwhile, new
revenues have been realized by companies pioneering Internet
commerce.
</P>
<P>
But the findings also indicate that the phenomenal business
growth in the Internet may plateau because of the failure of
technology standards to meet business requirements, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
There is a danger that the Internet will not complete its
promise as a business infrastructure opening up new markets and
encouraging new ways of doing business, IDC said.

<HEADLINE> Europe Stops E. African Fish Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 16 (Xinhua)-- The European Union (EU) has
decided to ban importation of fish products from east Africa from
July 1, which is likely to cripple the region's booming fishing
industry.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's New Vision reported that the ban is to affect the
local fishing industry which has yet to come to terms with the
effects of last December's ban of fresh fish and frozen fish
import.
</P>
<P>
The ban is implemented due to worries over the alleged
contamination by cholera and other bio-chemical substances, it
added.
</P>
<P>
The EU has sent an official note to the countries that export
fish products to them. And Uganda has acknowledged that it has
received the note.
</P>
<P>
"Yes it is true we have received the letter. We have nothing
to comment on the issue," an official in charge of fisheries in
the ministry of agriculture was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Fish is a big foreign exchange earner for Uganda. It earned 75
million U.S. Dollars for the country in 1997. The EU is
traditionally the main export market for east Afirca's fish. It
has in the recent part put in strict regulations over the
processing of food for human consumption.
</P>
<P>
Previously, it put a ban on fish imports from Uganda because
of Ugandan factories and products not meeting the new EU
standards on food and a scare that Uganda had the intention to
spray chemicals on the Lake Victoria to fight the water hyacinth.

<HEADLINE> Military Reshuffle: A Result of Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has sent army Chief of Staff Brig. James Kazini to temporarily
replace Col. Charles Angina as Commander of the second division
fighting the rebels in the west.
</P>
<P>
This decision was made by Museveni, also the
commander-in-chief of the armed forces, in response to a loud
outcry against the army's tactics in the June 8 massacre in which
over 80 students were burnt to death by Allied Democratic Forces
(ADF) rebels in a pre-dawn inferno.
</P>
<P>
A Tuesday Monitor report said Deputy Army Commander, Brig.
Joram Mugume, will serve in Kazini's former position as acting
Chief of Staff.
</P>
<P>
Mugume was quoted by Tuesday's New Vision daily as saying that
Angina is to go for studies. But he did not reveal the fate of
Angina's deputy, who he said was also replaced in this shakeup.
</P>
<P>
On the early morning of June 8, some 200 ADF rebels mounted a
surprise attack on the Kichwamba Technical Institute in western
Kabarole District. They burnt three student dormitories and
abducted over 100 students.
</P>
<P>
The government army protecting the college was reported to
have fled for their life without staging any resistance.
</P>
<P>
This massacre quickly gripped the attention of the whole
country and the government has been blamed by the locals and the
bereaved families.
</P>
<P>
Following the massacre, hundreds of residents of the districts
of Kasese, Kabarole and Bundibugyo started deserting their homes
on June 10 for sake of safety.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, parents of Mitandi Adventist College in Kabarole
have withdrawn their children fearing a similar blood bath.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Nasur Kibirige, the second division spokesman, said :"
there is panic in the three districts that something horrific
might happen again."
</P>
<P>
He attributed the rebel attack to the mounting pressure
exerted on them by the government army and their defeat in the
battle.
</P>
<P>
An officer in Bombo said this reshuffle is meant to inject
more vigor in the war against the ADF rebels.

<HEADLINE> FM Spokesman on Sino-U.S. Trade Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China called the U.S. government
to remove such berriers as high-tech export limitation and
enhance the competitive edge of U.S firms in China so as to
find a solution to the deficit problem in Sino-U.S. trade.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao made the remarks here
today in the routine press briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The deficits between the two countries are not as big as what
the U.S. side calculated," he said, adding that experts in the
two countries are working to find out a more acceptable
statistical method.
</P>
<P>
China places importance to Sino-U.S. trade ties and encourages
Chinese enterprises to increase import from the U.S., according to
Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he urged the U.S. side to remove its barriers, such
as trade sanctions against China and high-tech export
limitations. "American financial institutions should grant more
favorable credit terms for U.S. firms in China so as to
hone their competitive edge," he added.
</P>
<P>
Zhu indicated that the sustained development of Sino-U.S. trade
has played a positive role for the economic growth of the two
countries. For the U.S. side alone, the export to China created more
than 300,000 job opportunities while the bilateral trade generated
more than one million jobs for the American industrial and service
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The export volume from the U.S. to China witnessed remarkable
growth over the past two decades from 1.86 billion U.S. dollars in
1979 to 16.3 billion dollars in 1997, according to Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Also, the U.S. consumers gained benefits from the low-priced
China-made commodities, which are also beneficial to ensuring a
low inflation rate in the United State, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"It is with great potential for the two countries to further
the economic and trade ties, which are beneficial to the two
countries," he pointed out.

<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Six German football fans were
detained Tuesday morning by French police for making troubles
outside the Parc des Princes Stadium in Paris during the match
between Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Two of them threw stones and other objects at police in a brief
incident which took place before the match began. One of them
damaged vehicles belonging to the government.
</P>
<P>
Two others attacked a German journalist who sued the attackers
but refused medical treatment. Another of them was accused to
attacking a tourist.
</P>
<P>
Police said all these accidents were minor and no formal clash
had taken place between them and the fans during the match.
</P>
<P>
The Paris police department said that several hundred German
fans considered to be potentially dangerous and a group of other
German fans without tickets showed up outside the stadium
unexpectedly before the match began.
</P>
<P>
In order to contain the wave of fans, 1,500 policemen were
deployed around the stadium, said the police department.
</P>
<P>
They questioned whoever dared to break the police control line
or damage vehicles, it said.

<HEADLINE> Macao Airport to Cut Night Landing Fee by Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Macao International Airport
Company (CAM) announced Tuesday that from June 20 this year,
all landing charges at the airport between 11:00 p.m. and 7:00
a.m. will be cut by half.
</P>
<P>
The CAM said in a press release that the new charges, recently
approved by the Macao government, will apply to both scheduled and
non-scheduled operations of passenger and all-cargo airlines at
the airport, which is open 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
The night landing fee for a 395-ton Boeing 747, for instance,
will drop from 20,656 patacas (about 2,582 U.S. dollars) to 10,328
patacas (about 1,291 dollars) from the coming Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the airport will waive the passenger departure
charge for all air travelers who are to continue their journey
from the airport within 24 hours of arrival. That would mean a
saving of between 80 patacas (about 10 dollars) and 130 patacas
(about 16.25 dollars) per adult passenger, depending on their
destination.
</P>
<P>
The release said the moves are designed to stimulate additional
traffic at the airport, which has felt the pressure as the Hong
Kong new airport is to be inaugurated very soon.
</P>
<P>
The airport, which started operation in November 1995, has so
far handled more than 4 million passengers and over 90,000 tons of
 air cargo. Compared with the first four months of last year, the
passenger flow grew 14 percent and cargo flow, 40 percent in the
same period this year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 14 regular airlines are now using the Macao airport,
which has weekly flights of 440 to 28 destinations worldwide.

<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- French police unions Tuesday blamed
the govenrment for leaving loopholes in measures to prevent
violence during the match between England and Tunisia in
Marseille on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Violent clashes took place from Sunday till Monday in Marseille
between English and Tunisian fans, during which 48 people were
injured and 50 arrested, most of them English fans.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Boyer, the secretary general of the Alliance police
union told Agence France Presse that among the 2,000 policemen
mobilized in the field to control the hooligans, only 600 are
specialized in maintaining public order, all the latter being the
elite CRS or gendarmery military police.
</P>
<P>
"There is a hesitation to intervene rapidly, when the primary
incidents took place, which was also the case" during the
incidents at Champs Elysee in Paris last Friday, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another national police union the SNPT said that the incidents
in Marseille were not inevitable or hazardous.
</P>
<P>
"The misbehavior and exactions of the hooligans being
sufficiently known beforehand, the preventive measures and
protection could have been made efficiently," it said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the national police were in the field to protect
persons and properties, instead of waging urban guerrilla
warfare.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Will Bangladeshi PM Help Ease Tension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina left here for New Delhi Tuesday morning for a one-day visit
aimed at defusing the tension in South Asia in the aftermath of
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan last month.
</P>
<P>
This is the first trip of Hasina to India since the new Indian
government led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee from the
Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in March this year.
</P>
<P>
She is also scheduled to visit Pakistan on June 24 on a similar
one-day trip.
</P>
<P>
"This... visit is to discuss... bilateral issues" and would
fully concentrate on bilateral issues, Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad said Monday, denying speculation that the prime
minister would play the role of a mediator between India and
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here, however, said the Bangladeshi prime
minister would certainly discuss with Vajpayee issues such as
nuclear non-proliferation and stability in South Asia during her
current visit and with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in a
visit later this month.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Hasina expressed the hope to visit New Delhi
and Islamabad "as soon as possible" to discuss with her Indian and
Pakistani counterparts the situation arising from the nuclear
explosions by India and Pakistan. This showed her desire to play a
part in easing the tension in the region, according to the
analysts.
</P>
<P>
In separate letters to Vajpayee and Sharif, Hasina said an arms
race involving nuclear weapons and missile technology would be
detrimental to development and cooperation and affect the
atmosphere of cooperation and friendship in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has so far made no direct comments
on the nuclear tests by both India and Pakistan and has been
accused by opposition parties of being "weak" in dealing with such
an issue as nuclear tests which would seriously affect regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh should conspicuously express its objection to the
tests, the opposition said, as they had caused serious concerns
among the public in the country.
</P>
<P>
Hasina's visit was also partially aimed at improving her image,
the analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
As Bangladesh is heavily dependent on India economically, any
deterioration of bilateral relations would be disastrous and the
implementation of the Ganges water sharing treaty and the
Chittagong Hill Tracts peace accord would become impossible
without India's cooperation, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Awami League government regards the 30-year water sharing
treaty the country signed with India in December 1996 and the
peace treaty the government concluded with the hill tribals in
December last year as two of its major achievements.
</P>
<P>
That was why the Bangladeshi prime minister said in her letters
to Vajpayee and Sharif that "every country will decide its own
security perceptions and take measures accordingly," they said.
</P>
<P>
And on the nuclear tests, the most direct comment of Hasina was
that "nuclear weapons did not enhance a country's security in the
post-Cold War (era) and indeed, could diminish it." She apparently
tried to avoid annoying either of Bangladesh's two neighbors, the
analysts noted.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, the prime minister had to focus on
bilateral issues during her visits to India and Pakistan, with an
eye to gaining political support at home, they added.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka said on Monday, "We
(the United States) hope her efforts will contribute to lessening
of tension in the region." German and Japanese envoys also
expressed similar hopes.
</P>
<P>
But the analysts doubted whether the Bangladeshi prime minister
could really play a role in mediating between India and Pakistan
and thus help ease the tension in the region.

<HEADLINE> Asia's First Wine, Spirits Expo Held in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- V&AMP;S, the first international
wine and spirits exhibition for the Asia-Pacific region, opened
Tuesday in Hong Kong, one of Asia's leading import and re-export
centers for wine and spirits.
</P>
<P>
More than 700 direct and indirect exhibitors from 31 countries
displayed their products at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center, with half of the exhibition area taken by
France.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of spirits and wine has grown steadily in the
region over the past decade, acting Hong Kong Chief Executive
Donald Tsang told the opening ceremony of the expo which will last
until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Asian spirits market grew about 44 percent by value while
the wine market increased by about 14 percent from 1992 to 1996,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In Hong Kong we have no doubt helped that trend along by
reducing duties on alcoholic beverages," Tsang said, whose 1997
budget put in place a one-third reduction in wine duty.
</P>
<P>
The event was organized by VINEXPO, an international wine and
spirits expo staged in France biannually. The promising figures in
Asia prompted VINEXPO to create a specific exhibition for the
region, said Robert Beynat, chief executive of VINEXPO and V&AMP;S.
</P>
<P>
An attendance of 6,000 professionals from the region is
expected, including importers, wholesalers, commercial agents and
retail chain buyers.
</P>
<P>
To help trade visitors increase their knowledge of products and
discover the many facets of the continually developing sector, a
"university" program will be presented during the expo featuring
about 50 lectures and tastings.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia, New Zealand Sign Open Skies Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and New Zealand
signed Tuesday an "open skies" agreement to allow their airlines
to operate between and beyond the two countries without
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed here by Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim and his New Zealand counterpart, Winston
Peters.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Transport Minister Ling Liong Sik said in a statement
in conjunction with the agreement that it will facilitate the
future development of trade, investment, tourism and
people-to-people contacts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The 'open skies' will also afford various opportunities for
the designated airlines of Malaysia and New Zealand to develop and
enhance their air services and also to effect cooperative
agreements and smart partnership," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ling said that although aviation ties between the two countries
started only eight years ago in 1989, he is pleased that both
countries have adopted a liberal and positive approach to the
development of such links.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, New Zealand Transport Minister Maurice Williamson
said efficient international air transport links are vital to his
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
"The new air service agreement is consistent with this
objective and a signal of our commitment to liberalizing trade and
investment," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the accord offers significant opportunities for
airlines to provide efficient and competitive services to benefit
the business communities and wider traveling public from both
countries.
</P>
<P>
Peters, who arrived here Monday night for a four-day visit,
called on Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad and his
deputy Anwar here Tuesday and had an hour-long discussion with
Mahathir.

HARARE, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Access to electricity in Zimbabwe,
with a population of about 12.5 million people, still remains low
with more than 70 percent of the population still living under
conditions without electricity, a senior government official said
Tuesday.

Director of energy within the Ministry of Transport and Energy

<HEADLINE> Bottled Water No Better than Tap Water: HK Consumer Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Bottled water is not that much
better than tap water, according to a report on a recent test of
30 brands on sale on the Hong Kong market, which was carried out
by Hong Kong's Consumer Council.
</P>
<P>
The report said that most bottled water did not possess any
greater health properties and might even contain more impurities.
</P>
<P>
Some samples of bottled water contained higher levels of
undesirable chemicals such as arsenic and lead, than samples of
tap water taken from various sources in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Harmful chemicals were found in 23 samples, although the levels
complied with Hong Kong's Food Adulteration (Metallic
Contamination) Regulations.
</P>
<P>
Some samples were found to be slightly too acidic (less than pH
6) and might worsen the health of people suffering from kidney
disease. Such patients might be more susceptible to kidney
stones, caused by an increase of urea in the body fluids.
</P>
<P>
"If a consumer is looking for mineral content, they can
definitely consume tap water instead of paying for bottled water,"
Lo Chi-kin, publicity and community relations committee
chairperson, was quoted by English-language newspaper Hong Kong
Standard as saying.
</P>
<P>
But it was their choice if the consumer was after style, image
or labels. The best approach to absorb minerals was through a
balanced diet, Lo added.

TOKYO, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices futher slide in Tokyo
Tuesday as the U.S. dollar's surge to the upper 146 yen level gave
investors reason to sell shares.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 104.79 points, or 0.71
percent, from Monday's close to end at 14,720.38.

<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 10.74 points or 0.92 percent to

Turnover on the major section went up to an estimated 430 million
shares from Monday's 313 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan was the day's most heavily traded
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo stock market opened lower on the more than 200 point
decline of the Dow Jones Industrial Average overnight on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Negativity in the market was further fueled by the dollar's surge
to a high of 146.75 yen, traders said.
</P>
<P>
However, sentiment gradually improved to send stock prices into the
positive column after the Japanese currency rebounded by more than 4
yen against the dollar around noon to a high of 142.40 yen.
</P>
<P>
But Slight gains generated by the yen's rebound were wiped out by
late selling from foreign investors on lingering concerns over Japan's
economy and the yen's declining to the 145 level against the dollar,
traders said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,336 issues listed on the First Section, losers outnumbered

<HEADLINE> China Urges Efforts to Curb Devaluation of Japanese Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today
expressed concern over the downward Japanese yen in the foreign
exchange market and urged relevant countries, Japan in particular,
to take effective measures to curb the further devaluation of its
currency.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bangzao, spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, made the remarks today in the routine press briefing.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, the fall of the yen in the monetary market
triggered a new round of unrest in the financial market in
Southeast Asia. Taking into consideration the impact of the
Japanese economy and Japanese yen on the economies of East and
Southeast Asia, "the further devaluation of yen is detrimental to
the recovery of the regional financial market and the economic
adjustment in the region," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He urged relevant countries, especially Japan, to face up with
the reality with "courage and wisdom," and enhance cooperation in
stabilizing the yen so as to create favorable conditions for the
regional economic recovery. "The move is also in the interest of
Japan," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the rumor of the devaluation of Chinese renminbi, Zhu said
that China has made great contributions and paid a price in
stabilizing the Asian financial turmoil. "The rumor is totally
groundless," he said, adding that the stance of the Chinese
leaders and the People's Bank of China over the issue is
"consistent and firm."
</P>
<P>
"The international balance of payments in China is in good
shape and renminbi will remain stable," he noted.

Tung said extending electronic visas to HKSAR passport holders
would facilitate exchange between Australia and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>

country," the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Premier Kennett, Tung was briefed on
the development and application of information technology (IT) in
Victoria, the leading business and manufacturing center in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the state's experience in IT gave him an insight into
how to develop IT in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive also paid particular attention to the
state's electronic delivery of government services to taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
Early Tuesday, the chief executive made a keynote speech at the
Australia Summit held in Melbourne, capital of Victoria State,
focusing on the successful implementation of the "One Country, Two
Systems" concept in Hong Kong, how Hong Kong's has been affected
by the Asian financial turmoil and how Hong Kong is coping with
it.

<HEADLINE> China Concerned Over Australian Party's Anti-Asia Racism Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- China's Foregin Ministry spokesman
Zhu Bangzao today expresses his concern over the Australian One
Nation Party's anti-Asia and national racism policy.
</P>
<P>
The One Nation Party reportedly secured 23 percent of the
vote in conservative Queensland State Saturday. Although election
of the state is a domestic affair of Australia, China is still
deeply concerned with the recent anti-Asia racism remarks
made by the party, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Australia is a multi-cultural society where
overseas Chinese and immigrants from other Asian countries or
regions have made great contributions to its economic development
and social progress.
</P>
<P>
At a time when ethnic equality has become the current global
trend, the One Nation Party's anti-Asia and national racism
policy will not only be unpopular but will also run against
historical trends, he added.

<HEADLINE>   Scientists Link Constipation to Colon Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 15 (Xinhua) -- American scientists found that
people who frequently felt constipated were more associated with colon
cancer than those who did not complain of constipation, according to a
report in the July issue of the journal Epidemiology.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Eric J. Jacobs from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and
Dr. Emily White from the University of Washington, both in Seattle,
studied 424 men and women with colon cancer and 414 people without the
disease, and found that the former were more than four times as likely
to develop colon cancer as the latter.
</P>
<P>
They speculate that constipation may increase the risk of colon
cancer because "the longer transit time associated with constipation
may result in greater colonic absorption of water and fiber
metabolites, leading to lower-weight, harder stools with higher
concentrations of carcinogens."
</P>
<P>
They recommended a way of preventing common forms of constipation:
adoption of a higher-vegetable, low-red meat diet and a regular
exercise regimen.
</P>
<P>
"Such a lifestyle may reduce the risk of colon cancer as well as
the risk of several other chronic diseases," they wrote in the journal
Epidemiology.

MOSCOW, June 16 (Xinhua) -- During a telephone conversation on
Monday with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin stressed the need to avoid military action in Kosovo, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the phone call made one day before meeting with his Yugoslav

the statement issued by the foreign ministers of the Group of
Eight industrial countries in London.
</P>
<P>
The ministers said in the statement that the G-8 supported
Russia's efforts in seeking a peaceful settlement of the conflict,
including the upcoming talks between Russian and Yugoslav
presidents.
</P>
<P>
During the telephone call, Yeltsin once again voiced Russia's
opposition to using force in Kosovo and called for a negotiated
settlement for the region, Itar-Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, on his part, expressed the hope that the talks between
Yeltsin and Milosevic, who arrived in Moscow Monday evening for a
one-day visit, will be a success and lay the foundation for a
speedy settlement of the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
The Russian and U.S. presidents shared the view that an early
start of talks between Belgrade and Kosovo Albanians will
facilitate peace in the Balkans, the reports said.

In the conversation, special attention was also paid to
Russia's ratification of the START II nuclear disarmament treaty.
Both presidents confirmed their adherence to speeding up the
ratification process, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister Supports Suit Against Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Health Minister Yehoshua
Matza has expressed his support for a health insurance
organization in its initiative on filing a suit against a tobacco
company, the Jerusalem Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued Monday by the Health Ministry, Matza
"congratulated" Maccabi Health Insurance Scheme on the suit of
1.75 billion shekels (about 480 million U.S. dollars) it filed
earlier in the day in the Tel Aviv District Court against the
Dubek tobacco company.
</P>
<P>
Following a worldwide trend that began with successful action
against a number of U.S. and European cigarette manufacturers,
Maccabi is arguing that the defendant is responsible for damages
connected to its expenditures on smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Maccabi is demanding 250 million shekels (about 68.6 million
dollars) from Dubek for each year since 1991, the last year before
a law limiting tobacco selling was publicized.
</P>
<P>
The suit is separate from the other filed last fall by dozens
of former smokers, or families of deceased smokers. The plaintiffs
claimed that they were not aware of nicotine being "added to make
cigarettes more addictive and the health dangers posed by smoking,
which were not mentioned for decades in Dubek's advertising."
</P>
<P>
Ran Rahav, spokesman for the government-recognized monopoly
that sells most of the cigarettes smoked by Israelis, said Dubek
"had not yet received" the documents concerning Maccabi's
suit. "When we receive them, we will comment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another health fund, Kupat Holim Clalit, is now seriously
considering the possibility of joining the suit, according to the
newspaper.

<HEADLINE> Mangrove Forest: Wonderful View in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Tourists, who travel in south
China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, will be fascinated by a
wonderful view of thick submarine forest -- mangrove.
</P>
<P>
A particular kind of tropical and semitropical plant, the
mangrove benefits the coastal residents. It roots deeply in
the seabed to fix the sands, and stretches its luxuriant branches
and leaves on the surface of the water, building a seawall to
resist attacking tides.
</P>
<P>
The mangrove is good for the ocean's ecosystem. Its leaves and
flowers serve as food for fish, its roots are homes for crabs and
eels, and shellfishes are often found to stay on its trunks.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has 5,654 hectares of mangrove forests, the country's
largest, accounting for one-third of the nation's total. Since the
1990s, the region has invested more than six million yuan to
establish two mangrove forest natural reserves, and plant about
3,440 hectares of such trees.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, the state approved to set up the Shankou Mangrove
Forest Natural Reserve, where mangrove trees are under good
protection and have become a tourism attraction as well a place
for scientific research.
</P>
<P>
The province's marine management department has established
cooperative contacts with a research institute of the United
States, and exchanged investigation groups with Malaysia,
Hongkong over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The unusual beautiful scenery of mangrove forests can also be
seen in Guangdong, Hainan, Taiwan and Fujian provinces.

</P>
<P>
The infrastructural projects, mainly in transportation and
energy sectors, are aimed at giving a strong impetus to Turkey's

</P>
<P>
An oil pipeline from Baku, capital of Azerbaijan, to southern
Turkish city of Ceyhan will be the largest project in the field of
energy in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The segment of the pipeline in Turkey will cost about 2 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will also spend another 2.5 billion dollars to build a
nuclear power plant in the next years. After being completed, the
power plant can generate an annual 10 billion kilowatt-hours of
electricity.

<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- German coach Berti Vogts was not fully
satisfied with his European champion team's performance in their 2-0
win here over the United States in the World Cup finals on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Germany scored one goal in the each half to clinch the victory in
Group F but Vogts said the overall performance from the European
champion was not good enough.
</P>
<P>
"It was important to get the three points, of course, and we did
start well," Vogts said. "But then we lost our way."
</P>
<P>
He added, "A 2-0 win is a reasonable result. But we lost our shape
and gave thenm a sniff of getting something out of the game by giving
them a few chances. Andrea Kopke was excellent in goal, thank
goodness, to ensure we kept a clean sheet."
</P>
<P>
Vogts added, "We need to find a better rhythm and close our
opponents down more," Vogts said. "A lot of passes went astray, and
you will get punished for that at this level. We have a tough game
against Yugoslavia coming up, and we have to pull our socks up for
that one."
</P>
<P>
German will meet Yugoslavia in Lens on June 21.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Real Estate Developers Facing Flat Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Due to the difficult economic
situation and overpricing of the properties in Lebanon, Lebanese
real estate developers are facing a stagnant market, the Daily
Star newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a report released for 1997 by the Lebanese
government as saying that property transactions in 1997 changed
little in comparison with 1996 with 47,373 properties sold
in Lebanon for 2.25 billion U.S. dollars against 48,141
properties in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that more than 250,000 apartments and office
blocks in Lebanon remain vacant.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 3,310 properties in the capital of Beirut where
nearly a third of the country's population live were sold for
565.3 million dollars, representing 25.11 percent of the total
real estate value and 6.99 percent of the volumes of sale in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the average price of an apartment in Beirut
stood at 171,000 dollars against 47,000 dollars outside the
capital.
</P>
<P>
Michal Morkos, a statistician who helped prepare the report,
said that the demand for new apartments in Beirut since 1995 had
dropped by 20 to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
"But we can't really say that we've reached a serious state
because the Lebanese sooner or later will buy properties to
settle down with their families," Morkos said.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the slowdown in the property market it was
still performing more successfully than other sectors of the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We must admit that although there was no significant rise in
property sales over the last three years, the Lebanese still view
lands and apartments as solid investments," Morkos added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Lebanese expatriates represented around 40
percent of property buyers in 1996-97.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Welcomes Deferment of Oil Price Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President-Elect Joseph
Estrada Tuesday welcomed the deferment of an oil price increase
which would affect three socially-sensitive petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The deferment was announced by the Energy Regulatory Board
after Estrada appealed to it to shelve the price rise, saying the
masses would bear a heavy burden if the prices of liquefied
petroleum gas, kerosene and regular gas were raised.
</P>
<P>
Estrada expressed apprehension that the country might be in
tough times had the hike been imposed, citing the effects of the
currency turmoil hitting the country and the ongoing recession in
Japan which could hurt the entire region.
</P>
<P>
The recession in Japan caused a significant drop in the value
of the yen, dragging the peso to a four-month low of 42.58 a U.S.
dollar Monday.
</P>
<P>
To prevent future increases in the cost of oil, Estrada
reiterated that he would ask the congress to review the
implementation of the oil deregulation law when he assumes office
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need for the congress to give the government
enough time to adopt measures encouraging new players into the oil
industry to create the competition needed to stabilize the prices.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Forex Inflows Still Weak, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exchange inflows into the
Bank of Zambia continues to remain weak and the banking system's
transactions totaled only 392 million U.S. Dollars in the last
four months.
</P>
<P>
The latest Citibank treasury letter issued here states that
the central bank recorded no foreign exchange inflows in the
first two weeks of May while total payments, on the other hand,
for the same period amounted to 8.5 million Dollars, Times of
Zambia reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The total foreign exchange transacted through the banking
system during the four months to April totaled 392 million
Dollars compared to the 469 million Dollars during the same
period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This represented a drop of 77 million Dollars or 16 percent
showing a further decline in foreign exchange supply to the
market this year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the tightness in the supply of foreign exchange
in relation to demand, the Zambian Kwacha has remained under
pressure. In May, the Kwacha depreciated by approximately five
percent in the inter-bank.
</P>
<P>
On a year date basis, the Kwacha has depreciated by 33 percent
in the formal market but it is expected that the rate of
depreciation will decline following the success of the Paris Club
meeting held early last month at which Zambia managed to get
530-million Dollars pledged aid, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In June, it is projected that the Kwacha will depreciate by
between 2.5 to three percent with the outright rate projected at
1930 to a Dollar by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) copper
production, which used to generate over 90 percent of the
country's foreign exchange, dropped by six percent to 17,780
tonnes for April and 11 percent below the March level partly due
to non-availability of supplies into the production process.
</P>
<P>
This will translate into lower foreign exchange inflows thus
exerting pressure on the already fragile foreign exchange supply,
said the report.

<HEADLINE> Former State Head Released in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State, General
Abdulsalam Abubakar Tuesday ordered the immediate release of nine
political detainees, including former Head of State, General
Olusegun Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued in Abuja by David Attah, the Chief Press
Secretary to the head of state, said the move is to "facilitate
the process of national reconciliation, reconstruction and
successful completion of the social-political transition
program."
</P>
<P>
Abubakar in the statement urged the released persons to
co-operate with the government in the efforts at nation building.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the international community to appreciate
the efforts at solving the country's problems by showing greater
understanding and sensitivity in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
General Obasanjo, the head of Nigeria's military government
from 1976 to 1979, was arrested on March 13, 1995 for alleged
involvement in a failed coup against the military government of
General Sani Abacha, who died a sudden death last Monday.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo is now serving a 15-year jail term in a prison in
Yola, capital Adamawa State in eastern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Other persons released Tuesday include Alhaji Dasuki, the
Sultan of Sokoto; Chief Bola Ige, former governor of Oyo State;
Chief Frank Kokori, former Secretary-General of the National
Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers; Chief Milton Dabbi,
former president of the Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff
Association; Chris Anyanwu, publisher of a weekly magazine.
</P>
<P>
Others are Beko Ransome-Kuti, chairman of the Committee for
the Defense of Human Rights; Chief Olabiyi Durojaiye, a chieftain
of the National Democratic Coalition; Uwen Udoh.
</P>
<P>
Also Tuesday, the Lagos State government ordered the release
of 18 persons arrested last Friday at an illegal mass rally.
Among them is Chief Gani Fawehinmi, a lawyer and leader of the
opposition group, the Joint Action Committee of Nigeria.

<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Italy prepare to face their second
group opponents Cameroon on Wednesday saying they know little about
the Cameroon team.
</P>
<P>
Just one day before the Group B match in Montpellier, Italian
head coach Cesare Maldini still keeps his game plan a secret.
</P>
<P>
Even Italian captain Paolo Maldini, son of the head coach, said
he had no idea whether his father will stick with the two-man attack
used in their match against Chile or throw on an extra striker in an
all-out bid for victory.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know who will play or what the formation will
be," said Paolo Maldini, "My dad has changed the team around before,
but I honestly don't know what his plan is this time."
</P>
<P>
Christian Veri agreed with Paolo:"I don't know what the coach
will decide or who will play against Cameroon. We've practised with
three strikers in training over the past few days and I think it's
worked okay."
</P>
<P>
The Italians are conscious of the strength of the Indomitable
Lions who failed to win three points against Austria due to bad luck.
</P>
<P>
"Physically they're a very strong team," said Cesare Maldini
said. "And I think they have improved a lot technically under Le Roy."

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Copper Mines Needs Urgent Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Consolidated Cooper Mines
(ZCCM) faces a very bleak future without an urgent injection of
investment and various experts have called for a quick decision
to salvage the mines and avoid serious economic repercussions,
according to Financial Mail.
</P>
<P>
The weekly newspaper reported that during the monthly meeting
of the Economic Association of Zambia the experts scoffed at the
country's negotiating team for ZCCM privatization for attaching
too much importance to the price consideration instead of seeking
a future investment.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and
Industry Chairman of the Committee on Mines, Theo Bull, as saying
recently that there is too much focus on the price instead of
looking at it from the immediate need of investment.
</P>
<P>
Selani Mwenachenya, a mining expert, also said the fundamental
problem of ZCCM is not cash but rather re-investments.
</P>
<P>
He said Zambia faces a problem because it is not negotiating
from a point of strength.
</P>
<P>
He said that right now "we are at greater risk given that ZCCM
is running and the mines cannot be covered or closed."
</P>
<P>
Mwenachenya said ZCCM might not exist much longer unless
something is done to make it viable.
</P>
<P>
Recently negotiations on the sale of some ZCCM assets between
Zambia and some big international mining companies broke due to
disagreement over the prices of the assets.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown has delayed the privatization process of ZCCM,
the biggest foreign exchange earner of the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Rebounds in May (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
M1, or circulating capital and deposits in banks and companies,
dropped by 15.5 percent on an annual basis by the end of May, with
growth in M2 represented by a 10.8 percent rise in currency in
circulation and 10.1 percent rise in current deposits.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade volume for May reached 26.22 billion
U.S. dollars, down 2.5 percent on the 1997 period. The export
volume of 14.93 billion dollars represented a 1.5 percent decline
on the figure for the previous year. The decline also brought an
end to 22 consecutive months of rising exports. The import volume
fell by 3.8 percent to 11.29 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report showed a 1.5 percent decline in retail prices
and 1.4 percent fall in consumer prices, with the drops
underscoring the emergence of deflation resulting from sluggish
markets and low efficiency of the industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
SSB officials noted that the May index for macroeconomic
operations indicated a rebound in economic growth resulting from
effective central government's policies which stimulated domestic
demand. Despite the fact that the growth rate was far from
equalling past records, it nonetheless signaled the excellent
potential for achieving sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
"However, healthy economic growth must rely on quality and
steady growth in the domestic market, rather than on increased
quantity," according to SSB sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The per-capita consumption of
nonstaple food in east China's Anhui province has outstripped the
world average.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, each of the residents in the province consumed 226 kg
of vegetables, 45 kg of meat, 13.9 kg of egg and 21.3 kg of
aquatic products, according to the Agriuculture Department of the
province.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, Anhui has spent six billion yuan in
constructing 206 Shopping Basket Projects, where
vegetables, pigs, ducks, beef cattle, chickens, and fish are
grown, according to an Agriculture Department official.
</P>
<P>
The Shopping Basket Projects produce more than five million
tons of quality vegetables a year, which are shipped to supply
residents in the province and also sold to many areas outside
Anhui as well.
</P>
<P>
The province produced 14 million tons of vegetables, 2.77
million tons of meat, 880,000 tons of eggs, 29,700 tons of milk,
1.3 million tons of aquatic products and 650,000 tons of fruits in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Figures, Features of China-U.S. Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The following figures and
characteristics of trade between China and the United States are
contributed by China's General Administration of Customs.
</P>
<P>
1. The United States ranked as China's third largest trade
partner from 1992 until 1995, following Japan and Hong Kong. In
1996, it replaced Hong Kong as the second largest partner before
resuming the third place in 1997.
</P>
<P>
2. Trade between China and the United States increased
continuously during the 1990s. The trade volume between the two
countries went from 11.77 billion U.S. dollars in 1990 to 48.99
billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
3. The U.S. share in China's foreign trade kept growing during
the 1990s. In 1997, it reached 15.1 percent, with 18 percent in
exports and 12 percent in imports.
</P>
<P>
4. In China-U.S. trade, China was in a deficit until 1992 and
moved to a surplus in 1993. Since then, the size of China's
surplus has kept growing. It is mainly linked to the added value
from re-exports by Hong Kong, exports by joint ventures in China
as well as U.S. restrictions on exports of its high-tech products
to China.
</P>
<P>
5. Nearly 40 percent of the trade between China and the United
States is achieved by entrepot trade in Hong Kong. In 1997, 43
percent of China's exports to the United States and 27 percent of
its imports from the same country were implemented by transit
through Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
6. In 1997, exports to the United States from the bases set up
by China for processing and assembling, or processing with
imported material occupied 58 percent of the total trade volume
between the two countries. Developed neighboring countries and
regions prefer shifting their manufacturing bases for
labor-intensive products to China. They import local raw materials
and sell finished products to markets in the United States or
European countries. China's export of processed products to the
United States goes far beyond its imports.
</P>
<P>
7. Mechanical and electrical products as well as
labor-intensive products are China's major exports and the major
imports are natural products and technology-intensive products.

<HEADLINE> French Press Highly Cover English Football Hooligans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 16 (Xinhua) -- All French newspapers carried
front-page pictures of English football fans clashing with
Tunisian fans and French police in Marseille on Monday, when the
English football team was playing Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
Most papers did not hide their dislike of the English fans and
their disgust of the hooligans who they said had not only tarred
the football sport, but also shown disrespect to France.
</P>
<P>
The daily Echo Republicain said that one wants to say: How good
it would be that England be eliminated! But the paper said that
the French should not go too far in their anger because the
British government has given "carte blanch" to France to act
against the hooligans.
</P>
<P>
The daily France Soir said in its front-page story accompanied
with a big photo of English hooligans:"It's all predictable."
</P>
<P>
It accused the English of "transforming Marseille into a battle
field and dragging into their wake the youths of the Northern
district of the city" where live a large North African community.
</P>
<P>
The Communist daily Humanity used two whole pages to report
Monday's event in Marseille. Under the headline "Warm Beer and
Blood in the Cup," the daily said that some English fans shouted
racist slogans and gave Nazi salute during their rampage.
</P>
<P>
The daily Liberation published a picture showing a beer
drinking skinhead English hooligan burning a Tunisian national
flag in the old port district of Marseille.
</P>
<P>
"A band of little Nazis drunken with beer should be corrected,
as well as the French followers of the National Front," said the
paper.
</P>
<P>
It also accused the organizers of only wanting to make money
and allowing all kinds of hooligans come to watch the match on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The daily Marseillaise said that since the tragedy of Heysel in
Belgium, one has understood that suppression of individuals is not
enough to eliminate the phenomenon of football hooliganism, which
was born in England during the rule of Prime Ministre Marguerite
Thatcher.
</P>
<P>
It said that England in the "black years" under Thatcher is
marked by an explosion of unemployment, destruction of social
welfare in Britain and exclusion of the poor in great scale.
</P>
<P>
"The dramatic weekend tells us: the football and the World Cup
are not isolated islands of the crisis of our society," it said.

ANKARA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Turkish newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning)
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish police on Monday uncovered seven missile launchers
suspected as parts of the Russian-made S-300 missile systems for
Cyprus on a Maltese ship sailing through the Dardanelles Straits.
</P>
<P>
But the Russian Defense Ministry has said that the shipment
has nothing to do with the S-300 missile deal reached between
Russia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom)

U.S. President Bill Clinton called on Turkey to show flexibility
toward Cyprus' S-300 missile plan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Bank Not to Intervene in Peso Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the Philippines
would not intervene in the fresh round of depreciation that the
peso is facing due to the sharp fall of the Japanese yen, a senior
bank official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Alberto Reyes, deputy governor of the central bank, said the
bank would allow the peso to seek its own level and let the market
forces decide the current market situation.
</P>
<P>
In case the currency situation worsens, what the central bank
will do is only to moderate the impacts of the peso depreciation,
he said, adding that the central bank would not use some of its
dollar reserves to replenish the foreign exchange shortage in the
market.
</P>
<P>
What the central bank is doing right now is just to wait and
see, especially when the prevailing economic recession is going on
in Japan, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Amid fears that the fall of the yen would spur another round of
financial crisis, the peso fell by 5.5 percent to 42.58 a dollar
on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Progress in Sino-U.S. Military Exchanges (1) (by Correspondent Zhang Rongdian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) will accept the invitation of the U.S. Army and will
for the first time send representatives to observe two
multinational military exercises scheduled for this summer.
</P>
<P>
The plan that the PLA will observe two exercises -- "Rim Pac"
Naval Exercises in the east Pacific, and "Cope Thunder" Air Force
Exercises in Alaska -- constitutes a major segment of the
"substantial progress" in the Sino-U.S. military exchanges and
cooperation over the past few years, according to a PLA official.
</P>
<P>
Such progress has resulted from frequent exchange of visits
by high-level officers from the two armies. The visits have helped
open channels for dialog related to relationships between the two
nations and two armies, as well as on global and regional security
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources report that Zhang Wannian, vice-Chairman of
China's Central Military Commission (CMC), will pay an
official visit to the United States in the near future.
</P>
<P>
In the past year and more, CMC Vice-Chairman and Defense
Minister Chi Haotian, Chief of PLA General Staff Fu Quanyou, and a
number of other senior PLA officers have visited the U.S. A number
of senior U.S. military officers have paid return visits to China,
including U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen and General John
Shalikashivili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
During last October's historic U.S. visit, Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and President Bill Clinton reached a consensus on
building a constructive Sino-U.S. strategic partnership geared to
the 21st century and on expanding exchanges between the two armed
forces. The visit provided a precious opportunity for the
development of bilateral military ties.
</P>
<P>
The consensus reached between the two leaders resulted in last
December's establishment of a regular vice ministerial level
defense consulting system between defense departments in the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Progress in Sino-U.S. Military Exchanges (2) (by Correspondent Zhang Rongdian) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cohen visited China last January and the two sides signed an
agreement on establishing a consultation mechanism for
strengthening maritime military safety, and avoiding accidents,
misunderstandings and wrongful judgements between the naval and
air forces of the two countries. The first annual meeting on
implementation of the agreement will be held in Beijing next month.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two sides conducted fruitful exchanges in many
professional areas, including military training and logistics, as
well as military law and science.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also reached an agreement on matters
concerning U.S. military vessels and aircraft visiting Hong Kong
following China's resumption of sovereignty over the region on
July 1, 1997. Some 50 U.S. warships belonging to 36 naval groups
and 65 sorties of military aircraft manned by 25,500 servicemen
have since visited Hong Kong for either logistical supply missions
or rest and recuperation visits. The two sides also agreed to
exchange information on matters related to humanitarian assistance
and disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
Friendly exchanges between the armed forces of China and the
United States fully demonstrate that both sides attach great
importance to the development of bilateral military relations, and
signify that related relations are an important part of
Sino-U.S. ties.
</P>
<P>
The increase in bilateral military exchanges has not only
contributed greatly to the development of overall
Sino-U.S. relations, but also to the maintenance of peace and
stability in the Asia-Pacific Region and the world as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Observers in Beijing believe the upcoming state visit to China
by President Clinton will greatly enhance mutual understanding and
trust, while at the same time adding vigor to the development of
bilateral relations and cementing friendly contacts between their
armed forces.
</P>
<P>
However, such exchanges and cooperation do not mean that China
and the U.S. will form a military alliance. China believes that
under the new historical condition, the only practical way to
ensure peace and security is to conduct dialog and cooperation to
increase mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
The most sensitive and key problem remaining in
Sino-U.S. relations centers on the Taiwan issue, according to an
unnamed official from the Foreign Affairs Office under China's
National Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that proper handling of the Taiwan issue in line
with the principles in the three joint Sino-U.S. communiques will
lead to the healthy and smooth development of relations between the
two countries and their armed forces.
</P>
<P>
China is fully prepared to work with the United States to
maintain the momentum of growth in Sino-U.S. military ties featuring
"more stable, pragmatic and active" attitudes in terms of
exchanges and cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economy Rebounds in May (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Hope for a rebound in the Chinese
economy was finally realized in May this year, with most indices
for the national economy showing positive changes after several
months of sluggish performance, according to a report
released today by State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
China's industrial sectors achieved a May value-added of 168.1
billion yuan, up eight percent on the 1997 period, with the
year-on-year margin of increase rising 0.8 percentage points on
the April level.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report showed that the state-owned sector contributed
76 billion yuan to the industrial added value, a rise of 2.5
percent on an annual basis, while the collective sector generated
43.6 billion yuan, up 7.6 percent. The added value for
stockholding (corporations) companies, foreign-funded firms and
other economic sectors rose by 10.8 percent to 48.5 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The industrial value-added for the first five months of the
year grew by 7.9 percent on the previous year's period to end at
776.8 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China's state-owned sector invested 400.6 billion yuan in fixed
assets, up 12.7 percent on an annual basis, with the year-on-year
margin growing by 0.5 percentage points on the January-April
period and by 2.4 percentage points on the overall average for the
first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the domestic market failed to see any hopeful
signs of a revival, with the country's May retail sales standing
at 226.5 billion yuan, up 6.8 percent the 1997 period. Rural areas
contributed 86.5 billion yuan to total retail sales, up 5.8
percent, with cities generating 140 billion yuan, up 7.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Deposits in China's financial institutions grew by
172.1 billion yuan in May, or 97.8 billion yuan growth on the
figure for the 1997 period.

LHASA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Lhasa, capital of the Tibet
Autonomous Region, has reeled under unseasonably high temperatures
for several consecutive days, with a record of 29.9 degrees
Centigrade reported on June 15.
</P>
<P>
The regional meteorological bureau attributed the high
temperatures to the impact of El Nino which has blocked the normal
arrival of the rainy season which usually begins in Lhasa at the
end of May.
</P>
<P>
While the highest daily temperature for last June hit 25
degrees C., the city has recorded 22 consecutive days of
temperatures above 25 degrees C. since May 19 this year.
</P>
<P>
The bureau noted that high temperatures which are expected to
continue for at least a few more days will not only harm the
growth of corps and grass, but will also threaten the health and
well-being of local residents.

<HEADLINE> New Survey: American Men Neglect Health More Than Women </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, June 15 (Xinhua) -- A new survey released Monday
said that American men are more likely to neglect their health
than women.
</P>
<P>
The telephone survey of 1,017 adults, conducted by Opinion
Research International Corporation between April 23-26, found that
just 60 percent of American men have had the basic health check
more than one time within the last 12 months, compared with 76
percent of women.
</P>
<P>
While 60 percent of men said they are concerned about their
risk for prostate cancer, but just 35 percent said they had ever
been tested for that disease. Only 48 percent of men aged 55 to 64
had undergone a prostate exam, even though risks for prostate
cancer, the number two cancer among American men, rises with
increasing age.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, 57 percent of American women aged 45 to 54 said
they had been examined for breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
"We have a large number of men who haven't even had a basic
health check since the Reagan administration," said Mike Lafavore,
editor-in-chief of Men's Health magazine, one of the co-sponsors
of the survey.
</P>
<P>
The results of the survey show that nearly 7 million men have
gone without a medical check-up for over 10 years, and more than
14 million men have not had a check-up in the past 5 years.
</P>
<P>
Younger men seemed to have a more laissez-faire attitude
towards their health compared with older men.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that just 62 percent of American men aged 18
to 34 said they recognized the value of a healthy diet, compared
with 71 percent of men aged 35 to 50, and 85 percent of men over
age 50. Younger men are also much more likely to smoke or skip
medical check-ups than their older brothers.
</P>
<P>
The survey cited the gap of attitudes towards personal health
as one of the reasons.
</P>
<P>
Just 26 of American men believe "health and fitness is the one
aspect of their life they would like to personally improve,"
according to the survey, compared with 36 percent of American
women. Similarly, only 50 percent of American men said they
recognized the importance of regular medical check-ups, compared
with 68 percent of American women.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Train Egyptian Technicians on F-16 Jets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has agreed to help train
Egyptian technicians on Turkish-made F-16 fighter planes in an
effort to enhance their defense cooperation, the Daily News
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper quoted reliable military sources
as saying that the agreement was reached when a high-level Turkish
military delegation visited Egypt two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Turkey's Tusas Aerospace Industries will
provide Egyptian technicians with necessary technical trainings on
F-16 jets.
</P>
<P>
However, it remains unsettled when Turkey will begin to
receive the Egyptian trainees and how many of them will be
involved initially.
</P>
<P>
So far, Turkey has sold 48 F-16 fighter planes to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that this is part of the efforts by Ankara to
further strengthen its military ties with Egypt, the most
influential country in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
They said that the training program might be aimed at
appeasing Cairo which has complained about the quickly expanding
Turkish-Israeli military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Turkey have signed a series of military and defense
accords under which they share airspace and bases for training
purposes.
</P>
<P>
Turkish-Israeli military cooperation has prompted serious
concern among Arab countries who fear it would change the region's
balance of power.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly stated that its military ties with Israel
are of bilateral nature and not directed at any third country.

He Zuoxiu, a physicist who participated in China's nuclear bomb
development program in the 1960s, said that President Clinton's
readjusted China policy which advocates the establishment of a
Sino-U.S. strategic partnership has helped change the views of
Chinese towards the United States.

President Clinton will arrive in China on June 25, following a

<HEADLINE> British Media Attack Hooligans in Marseille Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Celebration of England's opening
victory in the World Cup finals was overshadowed on Britain's
front pages Tuesday as the media attacked the soccer hooligans.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Monday condemned the
violence, which began on Saturday night but has gradually
escalated to rioting before and during Monday's England-Tunisia
match in Marseille.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 people were injured. Police detained nearly 80
Englishman, Tunisians and Frenchmen, and two of the Englishmen
were sentenced to three months in prison.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian on Tuesday quoted the commander of Britain's
police operations at the World Cup as saying authorities expect
more trouble as the soccer tournament progresses and that known
hooligans are either already in France or on their way to
orchestrate more violence.
</P>
<P>
The Times said that city authorities in Marseille, where
England defeated Tunisia 2-0 on Monday, were demanding
compensation from the British government for the damage caused by
English hooligans and that the city's deputy mayor has called for
England to be expelled from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Independent newspaper said in an editorial: "The only way
to stop the thugs - and the only appropriate way of saying sorry
to the people of Marseille - is for the team to pack its bags and
catch the first flight home."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also argued that the violence lends weight to
Britain's campaign to host the World Cup in 2006.

<HEADLINE> Rhino Numbers Swell in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The number of rhinos at central
Kenya's Lake Nakuru National Park has increased tremendously
since 1987.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) established a rhino sanctuary
at the park in 1987, when 21 rhinos were taken there. Now the
figure hits 71,, the Daily Nation newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A KWS official was quoted as saying that 27 of the rhinos at
the Lake Nakuru sanctuary are white and the rest black.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, South Africa donated 20 white rhinos to Kenya, ten of
which were taken to the Nakuru sanctuary and the others to Trans
Mara in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
Kenya launched the countrywide Save the Rhino Project in 1984
to stem the spate of poaching which slashed the national herd
from 20,000 in 1970 to only 400 in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi subsequently accorded the
black rhino special protective status.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the rhinos, the Nakuru park, which is famous for
the resident flamingos, has more than 2,000 buffalos and great
numbers of water bucks, gazelles, warthogs, baboons, leopards,
Rothschild giraffes and lions.

<HEADLINE> Barclays Bank of Kenya Cuts Base Rate on Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Barclays Bank of Kenya, a leading
bank in the east African state, has reduced its base lending rate
while other commercial banks are expected to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The Barclays Bank of Kenya's base rate on loans fell from 26
percent to 25 percent with effective from July 1, the bank's
managing director, Gareth George, was quoted Tuesday by meida
here as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move followed last week's budget reading in which the
Kenyan government said it will reduce its borrowing through
short-term Treasury bills.
</P>
<P>
George said the one percentage point reduction of the base
rate is significant in the current hard economic times.
</P>
<P>
There may be a further drop in the base rate in the future, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The governor (of the Central Bank of Kenya) was happy with
our decision and we expect that our customers will be excited
too," he claimed.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft budget is encouraging to banks and, if
adhered to, borrowing customers would be encouraged by lower
interest rates to go for loans.
</P>
<P>
"Last week's budget signals that the government's investment
in Treasury bills will reduce, hence will reduce pressure on
interest rates," said George.
</P>
<P>
The banker said his bank is now focusing on specific customers
in its efforts to improve customer relations.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking forward to classifying our corporate customers
and business customers so that we can be more focused," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current high interest rates in Kenya started the upward
trend in July last year after the lapse of the
multi-million-Dollar loan packages by the International Monetary
Fund.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Official Warns of Global Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior World Bank executive has
warned of global recession if the Asian economic crisis cannot be
properly managed, calling on Japan to stabilize its weak currency.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Michel Severino, World Bank Group vice-president for East
Asia and the Pacific, said the region was unlikely to emerge from
the deep recession until at least the second half of 1999, the
Australian Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
His opinion was backed by Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi who warned of dire worldwide consequences if
the Japanese currency could not be stabilized.
</P>
<P>
The yen has continued to slide, falling below 145 Monday to the
U.S. dollar, its lowest level since 1990, and has been blamed for
slumps last week in other Asian financial markets.
</P>
<P>
"If the yen dropped with no bottom a second Asian crisis would
take place," Supachai told reporters in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
"That in turn could lead to a world recession."
</P>
<P>
"The whole world should pay more attention to the Japanese
problem."
</P>
<P>
Severino, who with Supachai addressed the Australia Summit
conference on trade and investment, said it was a critical time
for the management of the Asian economic crisis with the outcome
delicately balanced.
</P>
<P>
"We have one crisis behind us and we have entered a period of
deep and probably long-lasting depression (in East Asia),"
Severino said.
</P>
<P>
"Growth rates for the region in 1998 will be in the range of
minus-two to minus-15 percent and the prospects for 1999 are
gloomy as well."
</P>
<P>
About 700 delegates from Asia, Australia and the United States
attended the three-day conference, which began Monday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A well-known Chinese proverb
reads: "The eyes of enemies coming face-to-face blaze with hatred."
</P>
<P>
However, when Han Decai met Harold Fischer in October, 1997,
all former hatred arising from a war over a little over four
decades ago had faded.
</P>
<P>
"Welcome to China and you can invest here," said Han, a
lieutenant general of China's Air Force. Fischer, a real estate
businessman, served as a fighter pilot in the U.S. Air Force
during the Korean War (1950-1953), the only direct wartime
engagement between the Chinese and the U.S. armies.
</P>
<P>
Han downed Fischer's fighter in an air battle on the Korean
Peninsula in 1953. Now, however, their talks shifted to
cooperation, investment and the future.
</P>
<P>
Han, 66, quoted Confucius as saying: "Reproof is useless in
terms of the past, but the future will be provided for."
</P>
<P>
Fischer plans to revisit China at Han's invitation during
U.S. President Bill Clinton's upcoming nine-day state visit.
</P>
<P>
The transition from enemies to business partners and even
friends is an experience not only shared by Han and Fischer, but
also by the United States, the world's most developed country, and
China, the largest developing nation.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the Beijing-based Horizon Market
Survey Company indicated that 74 percent of Chinese sampled regard
the U.S. as "either a friend or partner of China". The U.S. is
also the favorite destination for Chinese planning to either
travel or study.
</P>
<P>
However, the combination of distance and time have made the
U.S. "a remote and strange nation" for most Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Who is Clinton?" asked Liu Wencai, a farmer from Guang'an
County in southwest China's Sichuan Province, the hometown of late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. Liu was in Beijing with four other
villagers as tourists.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) held military exercises Monday code named
"Operation Determined Falcon" to pressure Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 85 warplanes from 13 NATO countries took off on
Monday morning from 15 airbases in five countries including
Italy's Aviano base.
</P>
<P>
They flew over Albania, Macedonia and border areas of
Yugoslavia in a show of force that was intended to end
Yugoslavia's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
General Michael C. Short, commander of the U.S. Air Force in
NATO's southern command, said the exercises were to demonstrate
NATO's will to make peace in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
NATO is demonstrating its ability to move very quickly and
project power, he added.
</P>
<P>
NATO Chief Javier Solana said on Monday the maneuver was very
successful and had achieved its objectives.
</P>
<P>
The allies fear the growing violence in Serbia's Kosovo
province, which is part of Yugoslavia, will spill over into
neighboring Albania and Macedonia, where ethnic Albanians also
live.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 people have died since Violence erupted in the
province where more than 90 percent of the population is composed
of ethnic Albanians.

However, increasing contacts and media coverage are helping
Chinese to learn more about the far distant country on the other
side of the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese agree that expanding contacts between the two

the U.S. and their memories of the landmark 1972 handshake between
late Chairman Mao Zedong and former U.S. President Richard Nixon

According to statistics from the Ministry of Education, a total

Winning over young consumers like Zhou Yan has to the great
success MacDonald's enjoys in China. The American fast-food giant
has opened 48 restaurants in Beijing alone, including one in
downtown Beijing near Tian'anmen Square.

Apart from a MacDonald's Big Mac, most Chinese who will quite
likely have no opportunity to travel abroad are enjoying the

English courses which quite often refer to Boeing aircraft, Nike
sneakers and Monsanto cotton seeds.

NAIROBI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Nairobi, the Kenyan capital, is
the 18th most-expensive city in the world, a survey released by
an international real estate firm says.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Daily Nation newspaper Tuesday quoted the survey by

</P>
<P>
The U.S. company bases its assessment of cities on the sale
price of the most expensive two-bedroom apartments.
</P>
<P>
The survey says that a two-bedroom apartment in Nairobi, with
an average size of 1,600 square feet, costs 2.5 million Shillings
or 400,000 U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The survey ranks London as the most expensive city, with a
two-bedroom apartment costing 1.4 million Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Economic Foundations Strongest in 25 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Australia's macro-economic
foundations were the strongest they had been for 25 years,
Australian Prime Minister John Howard said Tuesday in Melbourne.
</P>
<P>
In an address to the Australia Summit, an international meeting
on the financial crisis in Asia, the prime minister talked about
the economic achievements made by his government since it took
power two years ago: low inflation and interest rates, high
economic growth, lower debt and a projected budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
"From being a persistent high inflation economy, Australia now
has an inflation record virtually second to none (1.5 percent) and
the lowest interest rates since 1970s," he told 700 delegates from
Asia and the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Small business interest rates were now at 7.7 percent and home
loan rates at 6.7 percent, compared with 17.25 percent and 15.5
percent in 1986, respectively, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar devalued by about 20 percent against the
U.S. dollar during the past year under pressure from the Asian
financial crisis, reaching record lows not seen since 1986.
</P>
<P>
However, he stressed the differences between economic
fundamentals in 1986 and now.
</P>
<P>
In 1985-1986 fiscal year the budget was in deficit by 4.8
billion Australian dollars, representing 2 percent of the gross
domestic product (GDP), and the nation's budget in 1998-1999
fiscal year would be in surplus by 2.7 billion Australian dollars
(1.6 billion U.S. dollars), or 0.5 percent of GDP, the prime
minister said.
</P>
<P>
"The underlying inflation was 9.6 percent in the year to
September 1986, underlying inflation is now at 1.5 percent".
</P>
<P>
He also said Australia's debt servicing ratio was cut from 15.3
percent of GDP in 1986 to current 10.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Australia's net debt on current projections would be reduced
from around 20 percent in 1995-1996 fiscal year to 1.5 percent by
2001-2002, a level not seen in the nation for 20 years, Howard
said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian economy grew by 4.9 percent in the year to
March, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the problems in Asia, our budget still forecasts 3
percent growth in 1998-1999, a strong performance by international
standards."
</P>
<P>
"The OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development) predicts that over the two years 1998 and 1999
Australia will grow faster than any of the G7 countries and the
OECD average."
</P>
<P>
"Australia is being affected by the problems in (Asian)
regional economies. But we are in far better shape to weather this
crisis than would have been the case had not put our house in
order", referring to the massive cuts made by his government in
budget deficits during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted that the economic downturn in Asia was a matter
for concern given that 57 percent of Australia's merchandise
exports went to East Asia in 1997.

NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina, who will come here for one-day visit to India, is likely
to offer her country's capital Dhaka as a "neutral venue" for the
possible resumption of India-Pakistan dialogue, The Times of India
said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Though an Indian External Affairs Ministry spokesman on Monday
described Hasina's visit as strictly a bilateral event, offering a
neutral place need not be construed as mediation. "The idea is to
provide an environment that is conducive to meaningful talks and
not adversely affected by angry noises in India and Pakistan about
each other," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Differences over modalities on mainly how to discuss the
Kashmir issue, the major dispute issue between India and Pakistan,
at the foreign secretary level talks had created a stalemate last
Friday with Islamabad rejecting New Delhi's proposal for resuming
dialogue here on June 22 and instead inviting Indian foreign
secretary to Pakistan for the dialogue on June 20.

HANOI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is suffering a slowdown in
economic growth this year as its exports face fierce competition
on a narrower international market, Tuesday's edition of Vietnam
News quoted Prime Minister Phan Van Khai as saying.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) for the
first five months of this year dropped to 6.8 percent from 9.1

The prime minister was speaking in Hue city on Monday at a
mid-term review by the Donor Consultative Group, a mix of the
World Bank, Asian Development Bank, donor countries and
non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
Citing export difficulties as a major cause for the slowdown,
Khai warned that "these negative factors have affected the
nation's macro-economic balance and would do so for years to come".
</P>
<P>
He urged international donors to continue financial support for
Vietnam, while promising that his government would speed up the
renovation process, despite hardships, and seek to improve the
investment and business environment for foreign and domestic
enterprises.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Should Grant China Permanent MFN, Says Daley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States should grant
China a permanent Most-Favored-Nation trade status, a normal trade
relations arrangement between countries in the world, U.S.
Commerce Secretary William Daley said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are very much in favor of getting rid of this year-by-year
sort of review," Daley said at a forum when referring to the
current debate in Congress on China's MFN status.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the TransAmerica Public Policy Forum on China, Daley
said the annual debate "is not helpful to strengthening relations"
between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
At the forum, Daley and other speakers including Republican
Senator Dick Lugar, expressed their confidence that both the
Senate and House of Congress will approve the decision by
President Bill Clinton to grant China MFN status.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who will pay a historical visit to China on June 25,
made the decision early this month to extend China's MFN status
for another year. Congress have a right to debate and vote on the
decision within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Some lawmakers, accusing the administration of transferring
high-technologies to China, and China of human rights violations,
oppose the decision.
</P>
<P>
"But... it's the same, normal treatment we grant virtually all
our trading partners. It's the same policy that has enjoyed the
support of four presidents for every single one of the last 17
years," Daley said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the basic economic reasons: China is the fifth largest
trading partner; its transition to market economy is unleashing
billions of dollars in consumer demand; already about 170,000
American jobs depend on exports to China; China will be the
largest economy by 2030.
</P>
<P>
Noting that to expand exports to China is in the security
interests of the United States, Daley supports selling high-tech
products to China.
</P>
<P>
"It's just not the case anymore that strict American export
regulation alone will keep technology out of the hands of people
who want it," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the U.S.-China relationship is "the most
challenging, complex, and important bilateral relationship in the
world," Daley said, "A policy of engagement between the two is the
only option in the modern world. A policy of estrangement between
the two is unthinkable."
</P>
<P>
Daley's remarks were echoed by Bill Richardson, U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador told the forum that China, as one permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council, has played and is playing its
leadership role "very effectively and constructively" and the
United States needs its cooperation on a broad range of issues.
</P>
<P>
China and the United States have had good cooperation on a
number of issues ranging from the security in South Asia to
lessening the impact of the financial crisis in South East Asia,
said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about China's participation of the
G-8, which groups Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan,
the United States and Russia, Richardson said the issue is a "fact
of life" and "something should be considered."
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that China and the United States expand their
cooperation and exchange in culture, education and even sports.
</P>
<P>
The one-day forum was sponsored by the TransAmerica life
Companies, a group which comprises several insurance companys.
Guest speakers also include Chinese Ambassador Li Zhaoxing.
</P>
<P>
The discussion is one of a series of warm-up events just prior
to Clinton's trip, the first by a U.S. president in a decade. It's
a reciprocal visit to the one paid by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin to the United States last year.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Meat, Fish Sector Expands by 6.4 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar's meat and fish sector
increased by 6.4 percent in its output value in 1997-98 fiscal
year ended March, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The rise was due to increases in the production of livestock
and fishery, said a report on the country's financial, economic
and social conditions issued by the Ministry of National Planning
and Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
The production of meat increased to 283,294 tons from 268,135
tons, fresh water fish to 239,773 tons from 229,178 tons, marine
fish to 644,502 tons from 602,937 tons, and prawn to 31,459 tons
from 29,340 tons.
</P>
<P>
Total production of fish and prawn increased by 6.3 percent and
7.2 percent respectively over the previous year, the report said,
adding that per capita fish consumption was 17 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
The meat and fish sector is the third largest contributor
towards the gross domestic product (GDP) after agriculture and
manufacturing, sharing 7.3 percent of the GDP in the 1997-98
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Export earnings of the sector in the fiscal year with fish and
prawn as its major export items reached 167 million U.S. dollars,
surpassing the target of 145 million dollars, another official
report said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, with a long coastline of 2,832 kilometers and
extensive river systems, is rich in both marine and fresh water
fishery resources.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Myanmar has formed more than five joint ventures in
the production of fish and prawn and cultured pearl with companies
from Bangladesh, China, Germany, Japan and Thailand and the
finished products are exported to Australia, China, Japan,
Malaysia, Singapore, the United States, European Market and Middle
East countries.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the meat and fish sector reached about
270 million dollars in 17 related projects at the end of February
this year, according to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> British Entrepreneurs to Build Container Port in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Some British entrepreneurs have
formed a consortium to build a private container port in
Bangladesh, according to the latest issue of Economic Times weekly
reaching here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed container port will be built at Patenga Point on
the Bay of Bengal, 80 kilometers southeast of the port city of
Chittagong.
</P>
<P>
The British Department of Trade and Industry (BDTI) was
actively supporting the 290 million U.S. dollar project, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The British government was backing the initiators to implement
the project as it thought Bangladesh had bright prospect for
investment from British-based companies, BDTI's export promoter
David J. Burton was quoted in Dhaka as saying recently.
</P>
<P>
The British export promoter hoped that the container port would
be operative by the year 2002, saying that he was expecting
cooperation from the International Finance Corporation and the
World Bank to implement the project.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are two sea ports -- Chittagong and Mongla,
which can not meet an ever increasing demand for container
handling due to shortage of modern facilities and limited storage
areas.

The News:

<HEADLINE> Capital Flow Remains Tight in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Quoting figures released by the central bank Monday, the
newspaper said the country's foreign reserves stood at 27.5
billion U.S. dollars as of May 29, a drop of 400 million dollars
from May 15, despite continued surpluses in the current account.
</P>
<P>
The decline was attributed to the central bank's settlement of
500 million dollars in forward swap obligations, 300 million with
onshore counterparts and the remainder offshore.
</P>
<P>
Total net forward obligations as of May 29 were 13.4 billion
dollars, among which 11.6 billion with onshore institutions and
the remainder with offshore counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the central bank must reduce its forward obligations to 9 billion
dollars by the end of the year, with no offshore obligations
remaining.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves also declined due to limited dollar sales by
local commercial banks, the newspaper quoted a central bank
official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The baht depreciation and the foreign reserves fall implied
that capital flow over the last two weeks of May were not
favorable, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The central bank increased net lending to financial
institutions by 35.1 billion baht (816 million dollars) to 88.5
billion baht (2.06 billion dollars) in the last two weeks of May.
</P>
<P>
The increase stemmed from mounting demand for funds by
corporations for tax payments, as well as demand by local
institutions to meet liquidity reserve requirements.

<HEADLINE> Australia Confident About Asia's Prospects: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Tuesday his government was confident about Asia's
prospects, saying it would emerge strengthened from the current
downturn.
</P>
<P>
"I genuinely believe our region can learn from the present
crisis and emerge from it equipped for the next century,
economically stronger and politically more stable," the prime
minister said in Melbourne in an address to the Australia Summit,
an international meeting on the financial crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The speed and durability of Asia's recovery from its economic
crisis would depend on not turning backwards and inwards but
persisting with reforms that make economies more open and
competitive, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Building solid economic foundations is essential, as are
reformed financial markets and increasing transparency and
accountability in government and corporate decision-making,"
Howard said.
</P>
<P>
"The solutions to the region's current problems lie in knowing
how to use the benefits of globalization -- such as open markets
and foreign investment -- to our advantage," he told the meeting,
which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Some in our communities are tempted to blame outside
influences for the problems. They see globalization, especially
global capital flows, as the culprit," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But globalization has brought the capital, technology and
markets that have fueled the growth of regional economies," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Trying to close off our economies from the outside world will
cost us jobs and deny our populations the prospects of improved
living standards," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Chief Executive Tung
Chee Hwa, Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and
Singapore's Minister for Trade and Industry Lee Yock Suan are
among the speakers to 700 delegates at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Also participating at the meeting are international economists,
officials from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and
the Asian Development Bank, high ranking officials from Japan and
Vietnam, and the ambassadors of India, Indonesia and the United
States in Australia.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Proposes Solving Land Dispute with Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Croatia proposed Monday to set up a
mixed commission with Yugoslavia for negotiation on the definition
of a land border on the disputed Prevlaka Peninsula between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The draft agreement on a lasting solution to the issue of
Prevlaka was handed over to Yugoslav Ambassador to Croatia Veljko
Knezevic on Monday by Croatia Foreign Minister Mate Granic.
</P>
<P>
Since the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia in 1991, both
Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have sought the
ownership of the strategic peninsula which had a large naval
base. The pending territorial dispute has been the major irritant
in the normalization of ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Foreign Ministry said Croatia put forward the
draft in line with the United Nations Security Council Resolution
1147 which called on Croatia and Yugoslavia to resolve the land
dispute through bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian draft called for the normalization of relations
between the two countries, and quoted principles from the
U.N. Charter and other international documents on the
inviolability of internationally recognized borders, and the
peaceful solution to disputes.
</P>
<P>
The draft also offered full security in the Dubrovnik region of
southern Croatia and the adjacent Yugoslav region of Boka Kotorska
Bay, by means of mutual demilitarization and respect for the
territorial integrity and sovereignty of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
A sea border between the two countries would be determined
according to international conventions, and with the assurance of
a passage to Boka Kotorska Bay, it added.
</P>
<P>
Granic noted that the resolution of the Prevlaka issue, an
obligation of the two countries, would contribute to regional
stability.

The newspaper said the Labor Ministry has been asked to help
find Thai workers to replace the foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, millers are complaining that because of the
government's policy to repatriate foreign workers starting from
May 1, all rice mills in the country would have to cut their
production capacity by more than 50 percent, or to operate only
eight hours a day.
</P>
<P>
If the Labor Ministry fails to find Thai replacements for more
than 10,000 foreigners whose work permits are due to expire in
November, the industry could suffer a loss of up to about 700
million baht (16.28 million U.S. dollars) per day, Thai Rice Mills
Association Chairman Bamrung Kritphakorn said Monday.
</P>
<P>
At a subcommittee meeting on seeking substitutes for foreign
workers, Bamrung said the association and the Employment

province on Wednesday and another in central Saraburi province on

Thailand faces mounting pressure of unemployment due to the

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Invites Bids for Gems Extraction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 16 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar mines authorities is
inviting more bids from the local private sector to mine gems in
northern Kachin state of the country, official The New Light of
Myanmar newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A 7,800-carat ruby, once discovered in the Khappaya area of the
state, is being exhibited at the gems museum here.
</P>
<P>
The Myanmar Gems Central Supervisory Committee will allow its
nationals and private companies and organizations to extract gems
at plots in the area, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, rich in precious stones such as gems, jade and diamond
along with other mineral resources, needs capital investment and
technical know-how for the exploitation and utilization to
accelerate its economic development.
</P>
<P>
After the promulgation of Myanmar's new Gemstone Law in
September 1995, local entrepreneurs are allowed to produce,
transport and sell finished gemstones and manufactured jewelry at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Since Myanmar's gems and jade are well known in the world, the
country holds gems emporiums annually.
</P>
<P>
In addition to allowing local private sector to mine gems in
the country, Myanmar has also set up joint ventures with companies
from Thailand and Malaysia for the activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest official statistics, the output value
of Myanmar's mining sector, which includes gems and jade, rose 1.5
percent in 1997-98 fiscal year ended March and the production of
gems and jade in the fiscal year went to 24.7 million carats and
2.7 kilos respectively.
</P>
<P>
The export of gems amounted to 25 million dollars in the
previous 1996-97, the statistics added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expert Calls for End to U.S. Sanctions on China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. senior fellow Nicholas
R. Lardy from the Brookings Institute call on Monday for an end to
U.S. economic sanctions on China.
</P>
<P>
China has played a very important and constructive role in
dealing with the Asian financial crisis and "has contributed
substantial amounts of money, both multilaterally and even
bilaterally," Lardy said at a press briefing with two other
experts on China at the Brookings Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, it has contributed by affirming that it will
maintain the stability of its exchange rate. This is a country
that has not devalued its currency and currently has the fastest
growing economy by a substantial margin in the Asian region,"
Lardy said.
</P>
<P>
"China's contribution to Asia and its recovery doesn't come
simply through maintaining the stability of its exchange rate, but
sustaining the stability of its economy -- indeed, the forward
growth momentum of the economy," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Because of China's rapid economic growth, it absorbs a lot of
imports from the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"So it's really in our interest not just to applaud China's
ability to maintain the stability of its exchange rate, but we
really ought to be doing something or thinking about various ways
in which we can contribute to this kind of accelerated economic
transition that has become apparent since Zhu Rongji became
premier at a meeting earlier this year."
</P>
<P>
He said the Unite States has acknowledged the important role
China is playing by maintaining the stability of its exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Lardy said the United States should talk about ways in which it
can step up technical assistance in a variety of areas relating to
China's banking reforms, mortgage market, housing privatization,
the development of a social safety net, and a social security
system.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the United States is the only developed
country, the only advanced industrial economy in the world, that
does not have a technical and economic assistance program for
China.
</P>
<P>
Lardy criticized the delay of China's accession to the World
Trade Organization and the difficulty for permanent U.S. Most
Favored Nation (MFN) status.
</P>
<P>
"China already has permanent MFN from every country in the
world except the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is not even clear that we will be able to deliver permanent
MFN, should China become a member. So the gains to China are
fairly modest and the demands that are being placed on China are
quite substantial."
</P>
<P>
What really needs to be done is to recalibrate the U.S.
position with respect to China's accession, particularly in the
area of financial services, he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting the Asian financial crisis, Lardy said, the Chinese are
moving rapidly to try to address some of the problems in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"To try to get them to sign an agreement that would liberalize
their financial services sector overnight is pushing them off the
cliff," he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the trade relationship between the United States and China,
Lardy said, the relationship is highly beneficial to both
countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States now purchases almost a third of China's
exports. Exports from China are obviously a small percentage of
total U.S. exports. But China is now among the top 10 largest
U.S. export markets, and the fastest-growing U.S. export market.
</P>
<P>
"We are benefiting in terms of jobs that are being
created. Almost all of these jobs are in high-wage sectors," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
What the United States is importing from China is primarily
labor-intensive commodities, he said, adding that American
consumers are benefiting from lower-priced footwear, garments, and
toys.
</P>
<P>
"Although there is a deficit in our trade with China, it is
vastly overstated by the U.S. Department of Commerce. But more
importantly, we are not losing a lot of jobs domestically, because
most of what we are importing from China we used to buy from Hong
Kong or Taiwan or in other places," he said.
</P>
<P>
"So I think the bilateral economic relationship benefits both
countries," Lardy said. "It should be promoted."
</P>
<P>
However, Lardy noted that he was disappointed that the
U.S. economic sanctions against China since 1989 were still there.
</P>
<P>
"It looks like we will get through two summits and we will
still have in place the economic sanctions that were imposed on
China in 1989," he said.
</P>
<P>
Every other advanced industrial economy took those sanctions
off on the economic side in 1992, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's disappointing that after two summits the
administration has not figured out a way to get rid of the last
remaining economic sanctions," Lardy concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE BOGOTA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Colombian police captured
two major drug dealers in the capital city of Santafe Bogota on
Sunday, the national radio reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jose Carmen Galeano and his younger brother Melecio, accused of
being leading members of the East Colombia drug group, had been
wanted by police since November 1996.
</P>
<P>
The police said Jose Carmen was responsible for providing
chemical material used in processing cocaine in Meta and Vichada,
while Melecio oversaw the manufacture of the drug and its sale,
mainly to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The well-organized drug group was formed as the government
concentrated its strength on cracking Medelin and Cali drug groups.
</P>
<P>
With the arrest of the Galeano brothers, Colombian police have
seized more than 40 leaders of drug groups and about 9,000 drug
dealers in the country.

<HEADLINE> Marovic Re-elected as Montenegro Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 15 (Xinhua) - Svetozar Marovic, speaker of last
Montenegro parliament, has been re-elected by the first meeting of
the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
Forty parliamentary members of The Coalition for Better Life
led by Montenegro president Milo Djukanovic voted him in, while 26
parliamentarians of the Socialist People's Party, led by Prime
Minister Momir Bulatovic of Yugoslavia voted against him.
</P>
<P>
After being elected, Marovic expressed hope for extensive
co-operation between various political parties in Montenegro and
Yugoslavia. He said there was hope for this if everyone learned
how to understand each other and make compromises.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition for Better Life won the parliamentary election on
May 31, gaining 42 seats of the 78-seat parliament. The Socialist
People's Party, its main rival, won 29 seats.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed the United States-favored Djukanovic
victory, and the consolidation of his power over the pro-Belgrade
Bulatovic will have a far-reaching influence on the political
situation of both Montenegro and Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts Support Better U.S.-China Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. experts said on Monday
that U.S.-China relations have been improved in the past years
which have benefited both countries and should be further improved
by the upcoming U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
"The strategic dimension of the U.S.-China relationship is
important and growing," said Richard N. Haass, director of Foreign
Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, at a joint press
briefing together with Nicholas R. Lardy, senior fellow at the
Institution and Bates Gill, director and research professor, East
Asia Non-proliferation Project at the Monterey Institute of
International studies.
</P>
<P>
There is the old problem, but there are the new strategic
issues, or issues of greater strategic prominence stemming from
South Asia, where China is clearly a major influence and a major
factor, and the Korean peninsula, where the United States still
has its military presence in the post-Cold War world, Haass said,
"All these and other areas, the strategic dimension of U.S.-China
relations, what we can work out with one another, is obviously of
paramount importance."
</P>
<P>
The uncoming summit between President Clinton and the Chinese
leaders "is to institutionalize even more this relationship
between two countries whose ability to get along, for better or
worse, will obviously have far-reaching implications as we move
into the new century," said Haass.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the leaders of the two countries will
have the chance to stress their cooperation in much larger areas
from economic stability to regional security.
</P>
<P>
At the briefing, Gill said that the trend is very good in terms
of improving U.S.-China relationships and understandings in the
fields of proliferation and the military-to-military relationships.
</P>
<P>
In the upcoming summit, he said, the U.S. Department of Defense
expects to build upon "a relatively consistent policy of moving
forward, step by step, in strengthening the military-to-military
relationship between the two countries."
</P>
<P>
It will focus on opportunities to gain a greater insight or
transparency, through confidence building, into the doctrinal and
strategic understandings of the Chinese, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gill said, it was expected that at the summit, the two
militaries will reach an agreement to take further steps in
building their relationship in terms of cooperating humanitarian
relief.
</P>
<P>
It was also expected that at least a statement will be issued
that the two sides will be moving forward in reaching a memorandum
of understanding for the two militaries to address environmental
issues, Gill said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, he said, the two sides are close to reaching an
agreement for an exchange of observers, he said. With an
agreement, the two sides will be able to view each other's
exercises.
</P>
<P>
Gill supports a policy of engagement with China and is against
a policy of isolation. He said the meetings between leaders of the
two countries will contribute to a greater dialogue in the United
States and its relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
"One of the greatest problems we face, of course, is that it's
a country we do not understand very well," Gill said. The only way
to change that is "to devote greater resources, a greater amount
of time, greater amount of our efforts to understanding China."
That can only be done through a policy of engagement, added Gill.

<P>
BANDAR SERI BEGAWAN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the
People's Republic of China Xie Fei left here Tuesday for home
after a three-day official goodwill visit to Brunei.
</P>
<P>
During the visit at the invitation by the Brunei government,
Xie Fei had separate meetings with Brunei's Sultan and Supreme
Head of State Haji Hassanal Bolkiah and Brunei Foreign Minister
Mohammed Bolkiah.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting between Xie and the Sultan, the two sides shared
the view that further strengthening good neighborly friendship
between the two countries conforms to the fundamental interests of
the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Xie Fei said China would continue to adhere to the policy of
good neighborliness and friendship and would actively promote the
mutually beneficial cooperation with neighboring countries
including Brunei.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperation, Xie said that there exist great
potentials for cooperation between China and Brunei and both sides
could learn from each other for common development in many fields.
</P>
<P>
The Brunei Sultan described various policies being pursued by
China as correct and expressed his belief that under the
leadership of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, China will be
successful in achieving its objective of modernization.
</P>
<P>
The Sultan said bilateral relations between Brunei and China
are very good and there exist no obstacles in the development of
cooperation between the two countries, and he pledged that Brunei
will work towards further strengthening the bilateral cooperation
between the two countries especially in the economic and trade
field.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Brunei foreign minister, during his meeting with
Xie, spoke highly of the achievements made in the development of
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Xie informed the Brunei foreign minister of China's efforts in
promoting peace and development in the region and stressed that
nations, big or small, are equal.

</P>
<P>
Eleven counties in eastern and northern Romania suffered most,
where the rainfall reached 115 liter per square meter.
</P>
<P>
In Bacau County alone, more than 1,000 cattle were drowned. The
storms also cut traffic and power supply in many towns and
villages.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Indonesia May Drop 50 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Tourist arrivals in Indonesia may
drop 50 percent if the current political and social situation
persists, The Jakarta Post Tuesday quoted an official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Many tours, including some for much later this year, have been
canceled because people are still not confident about security
here," the Indonesian Tourism Promotion Board chairman Pontjo
Sutowo said in a written report for the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists dropped by 16.1 percent between January
and April from the same period last year. Riots from May 14 to 17
in the country caused a further drastic slump, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It predicts tourist arrivals in the country may drop 50 percent
from the 5.2 million visitors reported in 1997. Last year,
revenues generated through tourism reached 6.6 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pontjo said that occupancy rates in Jakarta's four and
five-star hotels sunk to an average of around 10 percent, and many
conferences and conventions had also been canceled.
</P>
<P>
Even in Bali, the country's most popular tourist destination,
occupancy rates did not exceed 30 percent currently.
</P>
<P>
Pontjo said that political instability remained the biggest
worry for tourists considering a visit to the country.

<HEADLINE> Central Chinese City Battles Yellow River Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Puyang, a city in central China's
Henan Province which was long been plagued by flooding, has found
a new way to ensure safety.
</P>
<P>
The city is located in the middle and lower reaches of the
Yellow River, China's second longest following the Yangtze. More
than 300,000 Puyang residents living in the surrounding flood
plain face the dangers of flooding.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers have employed every possible means to survive
flooding, with the most effective method involving the
construction of elevated platforms which provide families with a
safe place during floods.
</P>
<P>
The city government recognized the effectiveness of the method
and in 1996 initiated a project to reinforce the system by
providing each village with a single platform in order to improve
safety and save land.
</P>
<P>
Puyang allocated 50 million yuan for the construction of
platforms by end of April, with the new system providing enhanced
safety for over 230,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Local riverbeds have long been subject to silting, with
flooding in 1996 leaving 126,000 people homeless and some 238,000
local residents in poverty. The flood also resulted in direct
economic losses of over two billion yuan, or more than the total
local GNP for the previous 12 years combined.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Meet Martin Luther King Jr.'s Family </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
will meet with the family of Martin Luther King Jr. but is
reserving judgment on whether there should be a new investigation
into the civil rights leader's assassination, White House
spokesman Mike McCurry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will meet at the White House Tuesday with King's widow,
Coretta Scott King, and three of their children to hear the
family's concerns, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting is a follow-up to a telephone call Clinton
had with the family earlier this year, and an April meeting
between Coretta and Attorney General Janet Reno. That meeting was
scheduled after she asked to see the president regarding new
information on her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
The King family, along with other civil rights leaders, have
requested that Clinton form a federal commission to look into
King's assassination.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton asked Reno to pursue the family's request
"as a matter of courtesy and out of respect for the legacy of Dr.
King," but would withhold any decisions on their demand for a
commission until the Justice Department finishes its review.
</P>
<P>
King was gunned down on April 4, 1968, while standing on the
balcony of a Memphis, Tennessee, hotel. James Earl Ray confessed
to shooting King, pleaded guilty and was given a 99-year prison
sentence in 1969.
</P>
<P>
Ray recanted three days after his sentencing and sought to go
to trial. He never got that trial, and died of liver failure in
April at age 70. An investigation by the House of Representatives
concluded in 1978 that Ray shot King but that others also may have
been involved.
</P>
<P>
King's son, Dexter, met with Ray in March 1997 and said he
believed Ray was innocent.

BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey shows that the

"personal love affairs" in terms of privacy, a sharp contrast to
western women who place priority on age.
</P>

The survey of 750 women between the ages of 18-65 revealed
that 64.3 percent of respondents agreed that "personal love
affairs" ranked first in terms of privacy.
</P>
<P>
Some 6-9 percent of respondents listed "diaries", "income" and
"past experiences" as private matters.
</P>
<P>
The survey also reflected that the fact that Chinese women
between the ages of 21-30, college graduates, high income earners
and professionals accounted for the majority of respondents who
listed "personal love affairs" as the top priority.

<HEADLINE> NATO Pressures Yugoslavia With Air Power Exercise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- NATO conducted a four-hour air
exercise in Albania and Macedonia on Monday; both countries share
borders with Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported that 80 U.S. jet
fighters and 12 planes from other NATO countries took part in the
maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
Reports from other agencies said that the maneuvers, dubbed
Operation Determined Falcon, were a demonstration of NATO
muscle-flexing that could be a prelude to armed intervention in
Kosovo, a troubled province of the Yugoslav Republic of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
The planes took off from air bases in countries that included
Italy, Greece, France, Germany, Britain, the Netherlands and from
NATO ships anchored in the Adriatic Sea, Tanjug added.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the air exercise as a complete success, NATO
Secretary-General Javier Solana said in London on Monday that NATO
would use force to help end the Kosovo crisis if necessary.
</P>
<P>
On whether air strikes could proceed without U.N. Security
Council approval, Solana said,"We would prefer to act with
security council resolution ... but a relevant legal basis may be
wider."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said in Warsaw that NATO's
display of air power over the Balkans on Monday demonstrated its
resolve to end the fighting in Kosovo and its ability to rapidly
mobilize lethal air power.
</P>
<P>
Cohen hoped that Russian President Boris Yeltsin would succeed
in persuading Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, who was on a
visit to Russia, to end the Serbian military suppression over the
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo are seeking independence
from Serbia. Washington has said that it would not support an
independent Kosovo, but insist more autonomy should be given to
the ethnic Albanians, who comprise 90 percent of Kosovo's
population.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the Kosovo crisis as an internal affair of
Yugoslavia, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Lilic said Friday
that if NATO forces intervened militarily, Yugoslav troops would
take all necessary means to resist the enemy.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States might enter
the world basketball championship without its 12 NBA players,
according to a report reaching here Monday.
</P>
<P>
In response to a threatened player boycott of the world
championship, starting on July 29 in Athens, Greece, U.S.
basketball authorities are likely to drop their NBA players
already chosen.
</P>
<P>
The deadline for submitting 24-man rosters to FIBA was set on
Friday, so a decision must be made within four days.
</P>
<P>
Options include entering the 12-man Goodwill Games team, made
up of college players, or Americans playing overseas.
</P>
<P>
The NBA players decided they would not commit to playing as
long as a lockout seems likely July 1 when the NBA's labor
agreement expires.
</P>
<P>
"I think we'll just have to send another team," said NBA deputy
commissioner Russ Granik, who also serves as president of USA
Basketball."That will be my recommendation."
</P>
<P>
The 12 NBA players chosen for the U.S.team are: Tim Duncan, Tim
Hardway, Vin Baker, Gary Payton, Terrell Brandon, Kevin Garnett,
Tom Gugliotta, Grant Hill, Allan Houston, Christian Laettner, Glen
Rice and Chris Webber.
</P>
<P>
The world championship will be held in Athens, Greece, from
July 29 to August 9. This will be the fourth U.S. national team to
use NBA players. Rudy Tomjanovich of the Houston Rockets will
coach the team.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, June 15 (Xinhua) -- NATO-led Multinational
Stabilization Force (SFOR) Monday arrested Milorad Krnojelac, a
Serbian war criminal suspect.
</P>
<P>
Krnojelac was wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for
Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
</P>
<P>
French and German troops in the force conducted the move with
French special troops playing a coordinating role, the Tanjug news
agency quoted the French Defense Ministry's press bulletin as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, a former warden of a Foca prison in Bosnia and
Herzegovina, was then sent to The Hague, in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The French Defense Ministry called the move an act under the
United Nations 1088 resolution and the Dayton Accord.
</P>
<P>
This was the first case in which French troops in the SFOR have
caught a Yugoslav war criminal suspect in their controlled area.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ms. Louise Arbur, chief prosecutor of the ICTY,
accused the French section of the SFOR of passiveness in catching
war criminals.
</P>
<P>
In April, a Washington Post release said that during his
service in Bosnia and Herzegovina, a French officer had leaked to
Radovan Karadzic, a leading war criminal suspect wanted by the
ICTY, details of a plan to arrest him.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Police Foil Attempt to Smuggle Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian police have intercepted
the attempted smuggling of three five-year-old children to
neighboring Turkey, the Interior Ministry's press office said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The children were found hidden in a special compartment near
the engine of a bus belonging to the Turkish Avar company
servicing the Sofia-Istanbul route during a routine check of
vehicles by police at a parking lot in Haskovo, southern Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
A woman on the bus claimed to be the mother of one of the
children. She said the four were bound for Edirne, Turkey, where
they were expected by family members.
</P>
<P>
The police said the two bus drivers, identified as Djamal Kuklu
and Djaik Cubukcu, of Istanbul, tried to bribe the officers with
6,000 Deutsche marks (3,300 U.S. dollars) when the hidden children
were found.
</P>
<P>
They later said the money was what they got for promising to
take the children to Edirne.
</P>
<P>
The two drivers have been arrested and an investigation is
underway, police said.

<HEADLINE> China's Biggest Shipyard Under Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Pudong New Area of Shanghai will
be the home of the biggest shipyard in China by the year of 2001,
today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The Waigaoqiao Shipyard, which is now under tense construction,
will have an area of 14.5 hectares where buildings with a combined
floor space of 25,859 sq m will be constructed.
</P>
<P>
The project is estimated to cost 4.7 billion yuan, the
newspaper quoted an official responsible for the construction as
saying.
</P>
<P>
China's shipbuilding industry reached 2.2 million tons in
output last year, accounting for five percent of the world's
total.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted that ship demand worldwide will hit 37 million
tons by 2005.
</P>
<P>
The official said that large-tonnage ships would have a ready
market since ship owners try to reduce transport costs by shipping
more cargo per boat.
</P>
<P>
"However, China currently has no ability to compete in this
area due to a lack of a large shipyard," said the official.
"Waigaoqiao Shipyard will further improve China's ability to build
large-tonnage vessels."
</P>
<P>
Waigaoqiao Shipyard will be able to produce 11 ships a year,
each with more than 100,000 dead weight tonnages (DWT). The
biggest boats will be 500,000 DWTs.
</P>
<P>
The shipyard will use the world's latest equipment and
computer monitoring system to ensure efficient technology and
production management.
</P>
<P>
Orders have already started to flow in from the United States
and Hong Kong, according to information from Shanghai-based
Jiangnan Shipbuilding Group, the owner of Waigaoqiao Shipyard.

<HEADLINE> Border City Exports Vegetables to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Dongning County located on the
border separating China and Russia is serving as a major vegetable
supplier for eight million residents living in the easternmost
regions of Russia.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 trucks carrying fresh vegetables, fruit
and light industrial goods depart the Dongning frontier station
each morning bound for Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
The port opened to the outside world in 1989 and has since
handled over 1.2 million tons of export goods with a total foreign
trade value of one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The county, which is blessed with a mild climate and fertile
land, grows vegetable on over 4,000 ha and fruits on some 8,000
hectares. Dongning recorded a 1997 business turnover of 150
million yuan on exported of over 68,000 tons of fruits and
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Dongning has attempted to expand its market share by
constructing a wholesale center and Chinese goods market in
Russia. The facility, which covers 150,000 sq.m. and employs over
10,000 Chinese citizens, has an annual trade value of 1.5 billion
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Lays Off 5,000 Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 16 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) has
decided to retrench about 5,000 workers in the hope of saving the
airline from total collapse.
</P>
<P>
In a notice published Tuesday in major Manila newspapers, PAL
said it had to lay off 37 percent of its work force in order to
survive, blaming the 11-day strike by some 620 PAL pilots for the
"irreparable damage" done to the already financially troubled
airline.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal came in the wake of a decision by the Department
of Labor and Employment upholding the management's decision to
retire the 620 pilots who have struck since June 5.
</P>
<P>
The pilots struck in discontent with the management's plan that
they must retire after serving in the company for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Before the walkout, PAL had already been groaning allegedly
from ruinous competition and short of funds as the result of the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"We have no other recourse but to downsize; the life of the
company is at stake," said a PAL official who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He added that the latest strike damaged the company's cash
flow, exacerbating an already cash-strapped position and putting a
squeeze on the airline's ability to service its maturing loans.

<HEADLINE> Guangzhou Sets New Goals for Auto Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, June 16 (Xinhua) -- This capital of south China's
Guangdong Province expects to raise the sales of its automobile
industry to 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) in three
years, from 1.28 billion yuan in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The city, which completed major restructuring of its auto
industry recently, is also pledging to eradicate losses in this
sector within three years.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on the local automobile industry held here today,
Zhang Guangning, Guangzhou's deputy mayor, said that the city will
spare no efforts to develop its auto industry into a new economic
growth focus and a pillar industry.
</P>
<P>
The sector has undergone twists and turns in its 40 years of
development. A major setback was the cooperation with French car
giant Peugeot which incurred two billion yuan of debts for the
Guangzhou Automobile Group, the Chinese partner. As a major step
in the restructuring, Peugeot was replaced by Japan's Honda
Automobile Company.
</P>
<P>
As part of a new development plan, the city will focus on
building four automobile bases.
</P>
<P>
The first will be a sedan-production base, mainly involving
the Guangzhou Honda Car Company.
</P>
<P>
The second will be a bus-production center composed of three
old enterprises now under the Guangzhou Automobile Group, and a
foreign partner, which is still being sought.
</P>
<P>
The third will be a light-duty vehicle base and the fourth, an
auto parts and components base.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will also be made to improve the work of the
Automobile Research and Development Center in the South China
University of Science and Engineering.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Extends Mandate to U.N. Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
adopted a resolution Monday, giving another year of mandate to the
U.N. Mission in Bosnia-Herzegovina (UNMIBH) until June 21, 1999 to
do more work for the stability in the Balkan nation.
</P>
<P>
The UNMIBH, with its current mandate expiring on June 21,
comprises a 2,1011 member police unit contributed by 42 countries,
and aims at training and advising the newly established local
police forces.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, U.N.
Secretary-general Kofi Annan said the last three months have seen
an increase in Bosnia in violent incidents aimed at returning
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The UNMIBH "will do everything in its power to further advance
the restructuring of the local police forces in order to help
create confidence for returning minorities," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"However, it would be overly optimistic to expect a decisive
change before the nationwide elections scheduled for 13
September 1998," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, some 20,000 refugees have
returned to Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
The UNMIBH was established in February 1996 to help parties
concerned with the implementation of peace accords, local elections
and low enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Taking the floor at the council's consultations, Chinese
Permanent Representative to the U.N. Qin Huasun said that China
still believes that the multinational stabilization force in
Bosnia-Herzegovina (SFOR) must not misuse force in implementing
its mandate.
</P>
<P>
The invocation of Chapter VII of the U.N. Charter is not
applicable to the provisions concerning the UNMIBH and the IPTF
(International Police Task Force), he said.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the actions authorized by the council
resolutions, the Stabilization Force (SFOR) must accept the
political guidance of the council and report to it on time on the
implementation of its tasks, he added.
</P>
<P>
He then voted in favor of the draft resolution put forward by
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Portugal, Russia, Slovenia, Sweden,
Britain and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Crude Plunges to 12-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil futures Monday plunged
to a 12-year low on the New York Mercantile Exchange after a
United Nations official suggested economic sanctions against Iraq
could end soon, indicating increased oil output.
</P>
<P>
Heating oil and unleaded gasoline futures also fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
Crude for July delivery fell 1.03 cents, or 8.2 percent, to
11.56 U.S. dollars a barrel, after earlier hitting a low of 11.42
U.S. dollars a barrel. July heating oil fell 1.42 cents to 36.70
cents a gallon; July unleaded gasoline fell 1.36 cents to 44.94
cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
Crude fell to its lowest level since August 1986 after the head
of a United Nations team searching for Iraqi chemical and
biological weapons said that Iraq could be allowed to return to
the world oil market in about two months.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices have tumbled 49 percent since October as supplies
continue to build in the United States and elsewhere because world
oil producers are flooding those markets to compensate for
extremely weak demand from Asia.

<HEADLINE> China, Ghana Sign Aid Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ACCRA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- China and Ghana Monday signed an
agreement on the free economic aid rendered by the Chinese
government.
</P>
<P>
The accord was inked between visiting Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan and his Ghanaian counterpart Victor Gbeho after an
exchange of views on bilateral trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also exchanged views on international and
regional issues of common interest, a Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting later, President Jerry Rawlings of Ghana
expressed satisfaction with the development of the relationship
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Rawlings, African countries have been
increasingly aware that the continent should not only improve but
also enhance cooperation with China in various aspects.
</P>
<P>
In the same vein, Ghana is to devote itself to expanding and
deepening its relations with China, said Rawlings, who also
expressed thanks to China for its disinterested assistance to
Ghana.
</P>
<P>
Responding, Minister Tang said, China and Ghana boast their
friendly relations and that the friendship, established and
cultivated by leaders of the old generation of the two countries,
is deeply rooted.
</P>
<P>
As developing countries, he said, both countries are facing
the same task of safeguarding national stability, developing
economy and maintaining friendly relations with neighboring
countries.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are also working together to the
establishment of a new, just and fair international political and
economic order, said Tang, who arrived here Sunday for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang, China and Ghana have attained encouraging
achievements in their trade and economic cooperation on the basis
of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Several projects built in Ghana by the Chinese side have
contributed to the social and economic development of the west
African country.
</P>
<P>
As the two economies are highly complementary, there is great
potential for further cooperation in the future, said Tang, who
became China's foreign minister three months ago.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the two sides have agreed to work
together to explore new ways and methods to step up trade and
economic cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit in order to
make the cooperation an example of South-South cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to increase visits by senior leaders
of both countries to promote the further development of bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministries of the two countries will hold
consultations in various forms to promote understanding and
cooperation between the two sides in bilateral and multilateral
fields.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday morning, Tang also met with Ghana's Deputy
Speaker Ken Dzirasah.
</P>
<P>
Ghana is the third stop of Tang's five-nation west African
tour. The Chinese minister already visited Guinea and Cote
d'Ivoire and is to leave Tuesday for Togo and Benin.

<HEADLINE> Five Chinese Kidnap Victims Freed by Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- Five kidnapped Chinese were freed
Monday morning after a joint operation between London police and
their Chinese counterparts, a Metropolitan police spokesman said
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
They were released and over 50 suspects were arrested in early
Monday morning raids on seven houses in London, Kent and Essex,
and more than 200 police officers were involved in the operation,
said Jeffrey Rees, detective chief superintendant in the New
Scotland Yard.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men, aged between 20 to 35, all recently arrived in
Britain illegally from China's southern province Fujian. They were
held up and asked to pay 250,000 Chinese currency yuan by their
family members back in China.
</P>
<P>
Another suspect was arrested in China involved in the kidnap
case, Rees told reporters in his office.
</P>
<P>
All five hostages were beaten and threatened to be killed
during their eight-day ordeal, which began on June 7. Rees said he
believed the kidnapping is the largest in Britain.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The Dow industrials plunged more
than 200 points Monday, hitting a three-month low, as pessimism
grew over the market for a recovery of the Japanese economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average sank 207.01 points to
8,627.93. The 2.4 percent loss represents the fifth largest
point-drop ever. This is also its biggest point loss since early
January and the lowest finish since March 13.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators also tumbled as nervous currency
traders sent the Japanese yen down to an eight-year low against
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Monday's loss cut the Dow's gain for 1998 to 9 percent, down
from a peak of 16.5 percent at the May 13 record close of
9,211.84.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 21.83 to 1,077.01, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 29.31 to 1,715.75.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outnumbered advancers by a more than a 3-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange, where NYSE volume totaled 582.90
million shares, down from 631.64 Friday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 11.78 to 554.89, and the American

</P>
<P>
The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 7.73 to 433.86.

The dollar's rise and the flight from stocks pushed the bond
market higher, where long-term interest rates sank to another

<HEADLINE> Kosovo, High Concern for NATO: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The developments in Kosovo are a
matter of high concern for NATO, and the North Atlantic Alliance
seeks solutions to the conflict and militates in favor of a
peaceful way of dialogue, NATO Deputy Secretary General
Klaus-Peter Klaiber said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Alliance pays much attention to this problem
as it is more than desirable to avoid what happened in Bosnia not
very long ago, said Klaiber in his meeting with Romanian Prime
Minister Radu Vasile. NATO is set to prevent any possible way to
extend in the region the conflict in Kosovo, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Klaiber welcomed Romania's part in the regional cooperation and
described it as "a significant contribution to the area
stability." "Romania is NATO's important political and strategic
partner that makes an active contribution to the joint efforts for
keeping peace and stability in Europe," he added.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Klaiber also held talks with Romanian Foreign
Minister Andrei Plesu.
</P>
<P>
As it was reported, Plesu said last week that Romania could not
fail to honor the commitments it made at meetings with the Contact
Group, if NATO declared war to Yugoslavia. "But the Romanians hope
from the bottom of their heart that military solutions would be
shunned and political dialogue would have the last word," he
added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Continues Moving Higher Against Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar Monday charged
toward yet another eight-year high against the yen as slumping
Japanese and other Asian markets forced more traders to surrender
their yen stock.
</P>
<P>
The dollar rose to 146.15 yen at the closing in New York, up
from 144.72 yen Friday.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was changing hands at 1.8105 marks, up from 1.8056
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The yen has been weakening since early this year, and it is now
hovering at its third eight-year low in a week.
</P>
<P>
Traders have fled the yen on continuing bad news about the
Japanese economy. Government figures released Friday showed that
Japan is in the midst of its deepest recession in more than 50
years.
</P>
<P>
Traders said the yen's early fall Monday caused most other Asian
markets to decline as well. Key stock indexes in both Hong Kong and
Bangkok, Thailand, tumbled nearly 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday:
1.5065 Swiss francs, up from 1.4984; 6.0725 French francs, up from
6.0545; 1,786.98 Italian lire, up from 1,779.00; and 1.4728
Canadian dollars, up from 1.4693.

<HEADLINE> Some 30 European Countries to Sign Environment Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, June 15 (Xinhua) -- About 30 European countries are
expected to sign a new "environmental rights" treaty currently
under negotiation in Geneva by the 55 members of the U.N. Economic
Commission for Europe (ECE), but two of its members from North
America might not sign it.
</P>
<P>
The Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation
in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters
is meant to ensure that the public has a say in decisions relating
to water, soil and air pollution as well as biological diversity
issues such as genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
The convention is a "radical step" not only for eastern
European countries but also some of their Western counterparts,
Kaj Baerlund, director of the ECE Environment and Human
Settlements Division, said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the convention would "change legislation and management
cultures" across Europe "to provide a broad range of easily
accessible environmental information."
</P>
<P>
"The final decisions, of course, will still be made by
politicians.... But there should be less conflict after the
decision-making," said Baerlund, a former Finnish environment
minister.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, diplomats and U.N. sources say Canada and the United
States have not taken part in the latest talks ahead of the
three-day ministerial signing conference opening on June 23 in
Aarhus, Denmark, an indication that they do not intend to sign.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Israel Sends Wrong Signal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Monday
that Israel's demolition of Arab houses in East Jerusalem had sent
"the wrong signal" and called on the Jewish state to refrain from
such "provocative acts."
</P>
<P>
"At the time when we are trying to bring the parties (Israelis
and Palestinians) together, these house demolitions send the wrong
signal," State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, Israeli authorities demolished three
Palestinian homes that they said were built without permits in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"At this delicate moment in the talks, where we are still
hopeful that we can reestablish the peace process... we renew our
call on both sides to refrain from provocative acts, which only
make the task of reaching agreement more difficult," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said there had been some progress made in recent weeks in
its efforts to restart stalled Israeli-Palestinian peace talks,
although differences still remained between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"There has been progress in recent weeks or we wouldn't be
still at this," Rubin said. "But in the Middle East peace process,
an inch is as good as a mile when it comes to an agreement. And we
have not reached an agreement."
</P>
<P>
The United States is seeking an Israeli troop withdrawal from a
further 13 percent of the West Bank, while the Palestinian
Authority strengthens its measures for security. After that the
United States said the two parties would enter into final status
talks. But the U.S. proposal was rejected by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rubin reaffirmed previous U.S. statement that if agreement
looked impossible, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright would
call a halt to the current mediation effort. But he indicated that
there was still something to hope for.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue working with the parties as long as they are
constructive and as long as we believe there is a possibility to
reach an agreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Yeltsin Discuss Kosovo Over Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 15 (Xinhua) - U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Russian President Boris Yeltsin discussed ways Monday to end
ethnic violence in Kosovo without force by phone, the White House
said.
</P>
<P>
"They explored in detail the prospects for getting an outcome
here that would not require getting an `all necessary means
resolution,' but I think it's very clear and certainly the Russian
government knows that we intend to proceed with that type of a
resolution if necessary," White House spokesman Mike McCurry told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Washington would pursue a U.N. resolution authorizing "all
necessary means" if needed, stressed McCurry following the
40-minute talks between the two presidents.
</P>
<P>
"The two presidents were in agreement that it's important to
work together to find the right diplomatic approaches that can
convince (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic and his regime to
do the right thing," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is expected to meet Milosevic Tuesday in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its allies want Moscow to persuade Milosevic to
agree to a series of demands, including an end to all action by
Serbian security forces against civilians and the withdrawal of
repressive units from the province.
</P>
<P>
Russia differs with its Western partners in the Contact Group
on former Yugoslavia on how the crisis should be resolved and
opposes the use of outside force.
</P>
<P>
"President Yeltsin indicated that he was going to do everything
he could to convince Mr. Milosevic of the precariousness of
Serbia's position," McCurry added.
</P>
<P>
"We believe and we understand the Russian president intends to
deliver a tough message to Milosevic, and we hope that the Serbian
leader is finally wise enough to take advantage of this
opportunity," State Department spokesman James Rubin told another
a briefing.

Being one goal behind, the American team geared up and played
more aggressively in a bid to get an equaliser. The German team
took the chance to launch some quick counter-attacks but most of
their shots were blocked by the American defence line.

<P>
The second half was more balance than the first one as the
American team controlled the midfield and outshot their German
counterparts. But their poor finishing let down all their efforts.
</P>
<P>
The German team, once being forced to defence, had a
counter-attack at the 64th minute. Oliver Bierhoff sent a long
over-head pass to Klinsmann while the latter chested down the ball
and beat the American goalie with a volley.

Bierhoff, who help the German team win the European Championship
in 1996, put up a disappointing performance. He squandered several
chances and seemed have difficulty with the American tight defence.
