TOP GIULIANI AIDE LEAVING T BECOME A LAW PARTNER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Randy Mastro deputy mayor who for the last five
years has served as both aggressor and peacemaker for Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, will resign next month to become a partner in the New
York office of a Los Angeles law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Mastro, 41, denied this weekend that internal politics or an
interest in elective office had played a role in his decision to
step down. He said he wants to spend more time with his wife, Dr.
Jonine Bernstein, and their 2-year-old daughter, Arianna, and to
rejoin his former law firm, Gibson, Dunn &AMP; Crutcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first love is the practice of law,'' he said. ``And now is
the right time to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, Dunn, with about 100 lawyers in its Park Avenue office,
is one of Manhattan's largest law firms. The Los Angeles-based firm
has a total of more than 600 lawyers, including 230 partners.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani will announce Mastro's resignation soon, perhaps as
early as Monday. ``The mayor enjoys a very close personal
friendship with Randy Mastro and understands that he's leaving for
family reasons,'' said Colleen Roche, the mayor's spokeswoman, who
recently announced that she, too, would soon leave the
administration. ``His departure creates a very big void which will
be difficult to fill.''
</P>
<P>
   In public, Mastro has often been the voice of the
administration, whether shouting over budget matters in televised
debates or standing in his office, baseball bat in hand, to explain
to reporters the details of the city's assault on the sex industry.
He was so identified with the city's mission to crush organized
crime _ in the Fulton Fish Market, at the San Gennaro Festival, and
in the private carting industry _ that for many months, he and his
family were accompanied by police bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   In private, he has been a key strategist, entrusted to negotiate
with elected officials, curry favor among unions and other special
interests, and persuade members of the Democrat-controlled City
Council to see things the mayor's way. A registered Democrat in a
Republican administration, he engendered suspicion among some
colleagues and loyalty among others.
</P>
<P>
   He has no clear successor as the deputy mayor for Operations,
responsible for day-to-day management of government and for
negotiating the city budget.
</P>
<P>
   Mastro began working for Giuliani more than a decade ago, as an
assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, where
he specialized in organized crime. After several years in private
practice, he provided legal advice to Giuliani's campaign in 1993,
and then worked on the mayor-elect's transition team. When Giuliani
took office, he chose Mastro to be his chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor's close friend, Peter Powers, resigned as first
deputy mayor in 1996, Giuliani made Mastro a deputy mayor _
although not first deputy mayor _ because, according to widespread
speculation, Mastro did not have the necessary political skills.
</P>
<P>
   Several people now say that assessment was way off mark. Fred
Jacobs, the chief counsel for Sheldon Silver, the Democratic
speaker of the State Assembly, said that he and Mastro had
negotiated several political compromises, even though their bosses
have a frosty relationship. ``Our closest moments have been when
our bosses have been firing the biggest missiles at each other,''
Jacobs said.

THOUSANDS TURN OUT FOR FESTIVE EXPRESSION OF GAY PRIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MELISSA SCHMITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES -- Teen-agers across the San Fernando Valley are
scrambling to get their driver's permits before Wednesday, the day
California will dramatically change a rite of passage teens live
for -- obtaining a driver's license.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joining 21 other states across the country, California is
toughening teen driving laws in an attempt to cut roadway
fatalities caused by exuberant young drivers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Motor Vehicles, motorists 15 to
19 years old make up only 4 percent of California's drivers. But
that 4 percent was involved in 8.8 percent of all fatal collisions
in the state in 1996 and 9.9 percent of all injury collisions.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to slash the number of teen-agers dying due to
avoidable traffic collisions, the state is putting into effect a
new licensing program that will extend from 30 days to six months
the amount of time a 16- or 17-year-old driver will have to hold a
permit before obtaining a full-fledged license.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen and 17-year-olds who obtained their permits before
Wednesday are not affected by the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who fall under the new law will have to get in 50 hours of
supervised driving time, including 10 hours at night.
</P>
<P>
   For the first year they hold a driver's license, minor drivers
will have to be accompanied by a parent or guardian when driving
between midnight and 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most painful to the teen-ager, the law says teen
drivers cannot transport passengers under 20 years of age for the
first six months, unless supervised.
</P>
<P>
   That's a major bummer in the eyes of most teens, who see the
driver's license as their personal emancipation proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Koscielny, 16, of Saugus High School in suburban Santa
Clarita, is one of those not greeting the new laws with open arms,
even though she received her learner's permit in the 11th hour of
the July 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good that we have a little more time,'' Koscielny
said, referring to the 50 hours of training and the extended
learner's permit. As for the law prohibiting teens from driving
their friends around: ``I don't like that part,'' she said. ``I
don't think that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sally Reed, director of the California Department of Motor
Vehicles, said the restrictions are in place to keep young people
like Koscielny, and others driving on the road with them, safe
until they get their bearings behind the wheel of a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are common-sense restrictions that affect the times and
situations when teens are in the most danger,'' Reed said. ``They
make good sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western Insurance Information Service, a nonprofit consumer
education organization, said a similar program in Canada proves
they make good sense. That program has been credited with a 55
percent reduction in fatalities involving 16-year-olds, a Western
Insurance spokesman said. The other 21 programs in the United
States are too new to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Umeck of Santa Clarita is friends with Koscielny's mother.
And Umeck, like her friend, has worried for months about the safety
of her daughter on the road. The two women, like many others they
know, have their own rules for their driving daughters.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the alarming statistics of crashes and collisions
involving teen-age drivers are much more than numbers to mothers of
16-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Umeck's daughter has lost friends at the rate of one per year
for the last three years to traffic crashes, numbers that simply
hit too close to home.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three fatal crashes would have been directly
prevented by the new restrictions governing teen drivers. They
didn't occur during the restricted hours or with other young people
in the car. Nevertheless, to Umeck and her 16-year-old daughter,
they are a painful symbol of why restrictions are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they're doing something,'' said Umeck, who is on
staff at Providence High School in Burbank. ``It's fine to have
more restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us have already implemented that anyway. My daughter
isn't allowed to take more than one friend at a time. When I see
five or six kids in a car with a teen driver at one time, it scares
me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Umeck's daughter Erin, 16, agrees with her mother _ to some
extent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it's good,'' said Erin, who also got her license
just under the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people go out partying, but say you're coming home from a
party or the movies, and you're going straight home instead of out
cruising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of my getting my license was so I could run
errands for my parents,'' she said. ``I'm a baby-sitter. And I take
this little girl to Magic Mountain. The new laws would be just like
having a permit instead of having a license.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have my license, it doesn't affect me,'' she said.
``I knew and that's why I took my classes over spring break.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to beat Wednesday's deadline, Erin also took her
driver's education through the DMV instead of school, where the
program takes place over the summer. ``When I finished I had just
turned 16. I practiced every chance I had,'' she said, explaining
the sense of urgency she felt.
</P>
<P>
   But the teen said she understands the need for the laws, as
frustrating as they are.
</P>
<P>
   When young people like her classmates die, it's a tragedy Erin
said she could live without. More so than living without the
privilege of driving her friends around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I feel I kind of agree with them. I do think we
all need to understand the responsibility, and we shouldn't be
abusing it,'' Erin said. ``Accidents can happen.''

THAT'S THE TICKET _ A FREE HOUR WITH MAGIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As tough as it was to get a seat at the Forum when
Magic Johnson played, the converse is true for scoring passes to
``The Magic Hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of tickets to TV show tapings are given out all the
time to shoppers at Farmer's Market, next to the CBS' Television
City at 3rd Street and Fairfax in Hollywood. But one of the
toughest to !ital!get rid of on this particular day last week was
the big yellow admission cards to Magic Johnson's weeknight talk
show, taped up the street at the Paramount Studios.
</P>
<P>
   A typical sales pitch from the guy paid to hand these out went
like this:
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``Want a free ticket to a TV show?''
</P>
<P>
   Customer: ``Uh, OK, which one.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``How about The Magic Hour?''
</P>
<P>
   Customer: ``What else do you have?''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``Howie Mandel... ''
</P>
<P>
   Customer: ``Jerry Springer?''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``No, he doesn't tape his shows here.''
</P>
<P>
   Customer: (Walking away) ``No, I guess not.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``Not even Magic Johnson?''
</P>
<P>
   Customer: ``Well... do I have to use the pass today?''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``It's good !ital!every day!''
</P>
<P>
   Customer: ``Can I have more to take some friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``You can take as many people as you like _ on this one
pass!''
</P>
<P>
   Customer: ``And it's free?''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``I'm giving them out! Complementary!''
</P>
<P>
   Customer: ``Can I get Magic's autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   Guy: ``Like I said, the tickets are (begin ital)free(end
ital)!''

METS BEAT YANKEES, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It took everything the Mets could muster to salvage
one game of their three-game series with the Yankees. And even
then, they needed an umpire to reverse a call to win.
</P>
<P>
   In the most bizarre moment of this weekend, pinch-hitter Luis
Lopez's fly ball to medium right field off Yankee reliever Ramiro
Mendoza with one out in the bottom of the ninth gave the Mets a 2-1
victory at Shea Stadium on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   But for a moment it appeared that the Mets might have to go to
extra innings. When Paul O'Neill ran down Lopez's ball with runners
on first and third, making an over-the-shoulder catch, even he
thought the game was over. Carlos Baerga could have walked home
from third base with the winning run and O'Neill would have had no
chance. So O'Neill disgustedly responded with a no-look throw back
to the infield.
</P>
<P>
   But when Derek Jeter gathered in O'Neill's throw to the right of
second base, the Mets' Brian McRae _ who had been on first _ was
already past Jeter and almost on second base. Jeter turned and
quickly threw to first baseman Tino Martinez, who fumbled the ball
as he stumbled over first base, but then appeared to touch first
base with his bare hand, having possibly doubled McRae off with the
final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Dreckman, the first base umpire, immediately ruled McRae
out. Mets Manager Bobby Valentine then rushed to the umpire to
argue. So did Baerga, all while the Yankees rushed off the field,
thinking they were headed for the 10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Dreckman conferred with the home plate umpire, Frank
Pulli, who apparently ruled that Baerga had crossed home plate
before Martinez made the tag at first, something confirmed by the
video replays. The Mets celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   The final play overshadowed an incredibly taut pitching duel
between Orlando Hernandez and Masato Yoshii, each of whom pitched
hitless ball for the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez allowed two hits in eight innings _ and only a
third-strike wild pitch prevented him from taking a no-hitter into
the seventh. Yoshii, meanwhile allowed two hits in seven innings
and struck out a career-high 10 batters before Dennis Cook pitched
two perfect innings to pick up the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga started the winning rally by chopping a second-pitch
single over a leaping Martinez at first for a lead-off double.
Butch Huskey then sacrificed Baerga to third, before Mendoza
intentionally walked McRae. On a 1-2 count, Lopez sent the fly to
right that ended the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost the series, but they salvaged something
nonetheless amid the strange ending on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   After a relatively quiet Saturday afternoon, the electricity was
back in force at Shea on Sunday night as Yoshii and Hernandez threw
hitless ball through the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   But both struggled with their control early.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who walked four in three and two-thirds innings
against the Braves last Tuesday night, walked Edgardo Alfonzo and
Bernard Gilkey to open the game. Still, Hernandez was able to
strike out Mike Piazza on a 3-2 pitch and, with the runners in
motion, Yankee catcher Jorge Posada easily nailed Alfonzo at third
for the second out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez walked John Olerud to give the Mets runners on first
and second. But Baerga meekly tapped up the first base line to
Hernandez, who kept right on going to record the third out at first
base.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii had made easy work of the Yankees in the top of the
first. But after retiring Darryl Strawberry on a routine fly to
left to open the second, Yoshii walked Martinez and Posada before
striking out Chad Curtis and Scott Brosius to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   After Hernandez walked McRae with one out in the bottom of the
second and saw him erased when Posada threw him out on an attempt
at a delayed steal of second, both pitchers settled down.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the fourth, O'Neill rifled a hard smash to Alfonzo's
right at third base. Alfonzo tried a backhanded stab at the ball,
but could not come up with it, and O'Neill reached first on the
error. While Strawberry struck out swinging on a 1-2 pitch, O'Neill
stole second. But Yoshii had enough poise to strike out Martinez on
three pitches, the last one looking. And, after issuing an
intentional walk to Posada, Yoshii was able to coax Curtis to hit a
two-hop bounder to Alfonzo, who stepped on the bag at third for the
final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in the fifth, someone recorded a hit. With two out and
Chuck Knoblauch on first after a four-pitch walk, Jeter lined
Yoshii's first pitch to him to right for a single.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the pressure was on Hernandez. The Mets finally got to him
in the sixth. The Cuban right-hander struck out Piazza, but the
ball skipped past Posada, and Piazza hustled to first before the
catcher could even throw, safe on the wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Up stepped Olerud, who responded with one of the best at-bats of
the game. Ahead 3-1 in the count, the struggling first baseman
fouled four consecutive pitches off before lining the ball to right
field. O'Neill tried a shoestring catch, but the ball short-hopped
his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's no-hitter was gone. Five pitches later, so was his
shutout when Baerga lined a 2-2 pitch past the pitcher's extended
glove and into center field for a single. Curtis's throw was cut
off, and Piazza scurried home without a slide. The Mets led, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   And the Yankees turned around and tied the game in the seventh
on Brosius' eighth homer of the season, which landed deep in the
visiting bullpen in left.

RUELAS NOW TRAINS WITH RIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Twice, they've engaged in dramatically intense
battles.
</P>
<P>
   The first time was in Mexico City, when Gabriel Ruelas narrowly
lost a decision and a chance to win the WBC super featherweight
title against legendary Azumah Nelson in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The second time was in Indio, two years later, when Nelson
scored a brutally easy knockout over a Ruelas, who wasn't himself
shortly after he delivered the blows that killed Jimmy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's interesting how things evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's long-time trainer was killed in a car accident last
year, and he had to find someone else to work with. Who does he
choose? Joe Goossen _ Ruelas' trainer.
</P>
<P>
   The rivals now train together in Goossen's Van Nuys gym and
ultimately will spar with one another.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas, who beat James Leija to win the WBC title but lost it to
Nelson in their second meeting, admits it's a strange arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he was comfortable with it, he shot a glance over
at Nelson as the Ghanan was preparing to spar, as if he was
checking to see whether he was imagining all this.
</P>
<P>
   However, he can appreciate the situation after thinking about
it: He has the unusual opportunity to work with one of the greatest
fighters of his time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably a little weird,'' said Ruelas, who exchanged
friendly words with Nelson when they saw each other last week.
``Obviously, it's a positive thing if I learn something from him in
the ring. Especially now that I don't fight that often.
</P>
<P>
   ``...I'm sure that when we start sparring every day, I'll get
used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, who lost his title to Genaro Hernandez last year, got to
know the close-knit Goossen family _ including promoter Dan
Goossen, Joe's brother _ as a result of the two fights with Ruelas.
</P>
<P>
   And he liked what he saw. He considers the Goossens and Ruelas
his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have something important. They have love,'' said Nelson,
who is listed as 39 but might be older. ``And those who have love,
have a fear of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about working with Ruelas?
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Nelson, who started fighting professionally in 1979,
has seen it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't understand the boxing game,'' he said. ``We
fought each other, yes. But it's a business. You don't have to
think bad about anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``...For everyone in this game, I have friendship. These are my
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas and Nelson are in the same position: Former champions
positioning themselves for another title shot.
</P>
<P>
   They fight separate opponents on an America Presents card in San
Antonio on July 11, featuring eight former champions. Ruelas, who
has moved up to the lightweight division, fights tough but limited
Troy Dorsey. Nelson takes on Leija, with whom he has a 1-1-1
record.
</P>
<P>
   Both are favored and, assuming they win, they could fight for
titles soon afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Said Nelson, ``After I knock out Leija, bring on anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Ruelas will fight anyone, but he likes the prospect
of facing rising star and fellow L.A.-area resident Shane Mosley,
the IBF lightweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   That would be a daunting challenge: Mosley, who is unbeaten,
looks almost unbeatable at the moment. But Ruelas has a little
something extra now; he has Nelson there to help him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I have a legend as a sparring partner and I don't even
have to pay him. That's a good deal,'' Ruelas said with a chuckle,
obviously tickled over his good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Good news: The fact Felix Trinidad has signed an eight-fight
contract with Main Events and HBO could pump life into a
talent-laden, but stagnant welterweight division.
</P>
<P>
   HBO now has under contract the three champions in the division:
Trinidad (IBF), Oscar De La Hoya (WBC) and Ike Quartey (WBA).
</P>
<P>
   Trinidad, apparently free from the grip of Don King, is expected
to face Quartey in November. Seth Abraham, president of
Time-Warner/HBO Sports, said Trinidad could finally step into the
ring with De La Hoya between May and September of 1999 _ assuming
Trinidad beats Quartey.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya has been under tremendous media pressure to fight
Trinidad, Quartey or Jose Luis Lopez _ possibly the best of the
bunch _ and in turn reportedly has pushed his promoter, Bob Arum,
to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   Quartey has a mandatory defense against Andrei Pestriaev before
the Trinidad fight.
</P>
<P>
   Changing times: De La Hoya is 25 and has fought no Hall of
Fame-level fighter in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sugar Ray Leonard was 25, he had fought Wilfredo
Benitez, Roberto Duran (twice) and Thomas Hearns.
</P>
<P>
   Times sure have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like it was back in the '70s and early '80s, when
champions fought champions,'' Leonard said. ``...It's more about
business now. I'm not saying that's wrong, to get top dollar. But
you also have to prove your worth fighting top fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You owe it to the public to accept challenges from anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Leonard doesn't blame De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Oscar is afraid of any fighter. I think it's his
promoter protecting him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Mosley, who destroyed Wilfrido Ruiz on Saturday
in Philadelphia, is rapidly becoming one of the top pound-for-pound
fighters in the world.

HOMER IN NINTH SINKS MARINERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Jamie Moyer is a cruel example that things even out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner left-hander won 17 games last season and probably
should have lost more than five. But this season he doesn't win
games he should win, and the list of should-haves keeps getting
longer.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer pitched seven solid innings Sunday against the expansion
Arizona Diamondbacks, departed for a pinch-hitter in the eighth
when the Mariners tied the game and wound up with a no-decision in
a 3-2 Seattle loss before 47,965 at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., slugged his 32nd homer of the season, but just
like 12 of his past 13 home runs, it came in a loss.
</P>
<P>
   The latest loss, Seattle's 19th in the past 27 games, came
suddenly.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Bobby Alaya, who tossed a quick and perfect eighth
inning, fed Diamondback left fielder Yamil Benitez a first-pitch
fastball leading off the ninth, and the ball landed in the picnic
area above the 413-foot sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moyer had gotten me out with changeups early in the game, but
against (Ayala), I was looking for a fastball,'' Benitez said.
</P>
<P>
   While it was the first time the Diamondbacks have won a game on
the final pitch, it's not a new experience for the Mariner bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the lack of offense in games Moyer pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was the exact antithesis of this year,'' said
shortstop Alex Rodriguez, comparing Moyer's back-to-back seasons.
</P>
<P>
   In Moyer's 30 starts a year ago, the M's scored fewer than three
runs for him only once. He won by scores of 9-0, 9-7, 13-4, 8-2,
15-4, 12-9, 8-1, 11-1, 10-6, 10-0 and 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is this season. In 18 starts, Moyer has lost games
5-0, 2-0, 6-0 and 5-2. Add no-decisions in the six games he has
surrendered three or fewer runs, and you know why the veteran is
5-6 despite having a better earned run average this year (3.53)
than a year ago (3.86).
</P>
<P>
   But he isn't banging his head against the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been shut out three or four times, but sometimes the
luck of the draw comes into play,'' he said. ``All you can do is
try to control what you can control. For me to sit here and
complain about the offense not scoring runs is ludicrous. My job is
to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   He actually had two jobs Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With the three-game series being played in a National League
ballpark, eliminating the designated hitter, Moyer had a chance to
help himself with a bat in the fifth inning, when he stepped into
the batter's box with runners on first and second, two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Left-handed starter Brian Anderson retired Moyer on a force out
at second.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had gotten a basehit there and got us to the top of the
batting order and put the pressure on the Diamondbacks,'' Moyer
said. ``It would have been nice to get a hit somehow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you know why I didn't like the National League.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, trailing 2-1, were looking for a come-from-behind
win when Dan Wilson singled to lead off the eighth and
pinch-hitting David Segui reached base on shortstop Jay Bell's
error. Joey Cora's sacrifice bunt advanced both runners into
scoring position, but the best Seattle could do was get a
run-producing infield out from Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The M's had another shot to go ahead in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez led off with a single, but Jay Buhner, attempting
to sacrifice pinch-runner Jeff Huson to second, popped out.
Left-handed reliever Alan Embree then picked Huson off base before
a full-count delivery to Glenallen Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't execute, that's for sure,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ``Jay is a pretty reliable bunter, and I've used him (to
sacrifice) before. He just popped that one up.''
</P>
<P>
   Huson's ensuing overanxiousness cleared the bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's basically a hit-and-run situation, and the only thing
you have to concern yourself with is getting picked off,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Huson, ``I read him (Embree's pickoff move) right the first
time and wrong the second time. I was running on the pitch and
wanted to make sure I didn't get thrown out at second (if Hill
struck out). I guess I probably should have waited a little
longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill walked on the next pitch, but Russ Davis flied out to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The game's next pitch, thrown by Ayala, was the final one of the
game and ended a terrific pitching duel.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer scattered seven hits. Anderson checked the Mariners on
five.
</P>
<P>
   Embree got the win. Ayala took the loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to get beat, it's going to be with my best
pitch,'' Ayala told Rodriguez, who walked side-by-side with the
pitcher in the visiting clubhouse, offering encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw the ball well,'' Rodriguez said. ``There's not much
you can say about a guy hitting a first-pitch, 92-mile-an-hour
fastball out. Can't do anything but tip your hat to the hitter.''

CLINTON, AT BEIJING UNIVERSITY, PRESSES CALL FOR LIBERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton proclaimed personal freedom the
``mandate of the new century'' in a broad defense of human and
economic liberty on Monday in a speech at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   In his last public appearance in the Chinese capital, the
president said the United States did not seek to impose its vision
of society on China or any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are convinced that certain rights are universal,'' the
president said, ``the right to be treated with dignity, the right
to give voice to their opinions, to choose their own leaders, to
associate with whom they wish, to worship or not freely, however
one chooses.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials called Monday's speech, which was
carried live on Chinese television, a philosophical discourse
addressed directly to the Chinese people, after a weekend that
featured a remarkable series of public and private discussions with
President Jiang Zemin, and a visit to Beijing's largest Protestant
church.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to several hundred students and faculty members in a
freshly painted auditorium at China's most prestigious university,
Clinton sought to broaden his audience from the Chinese leadership
to a new generation that will shape the future of the most populous
country on earth. Beijing University, which is celebrating its
centennial this year, has been the nurturing ground of successive
movements for political change in China.
</P>
<P>
   He said liberty was not a luxury to be enjoyed only by wealthy
nations, but a necessary element of human and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging China's centuries-old fear of internal
disintegration, he said all societies craved stability.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, personal freedom strengthens a nation's security,
rather than undermining it, as the Communist government has
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, and our experience demonstrates, that freedom
strengthens stability and helps nations to change,'' Clinton said.
``China's greatest source of strength resides in the minds and
hearts of its citizens. It is profoundly in your interest _ and the
world's _ that young Chinese minds be free to reach the fullness of
their potential.''
</P>
<P>
   He hailed the rapid economic growth that has swept across China
in the last decade, as the government has loosened controls on
private entrepreneurship and begun to close down its inefficient
state-owned enterprises. He said growing incomes brought more
options to the Chinese people: foreign travel, access to cable
television and the Internet, new career opportunities, a higher
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``But true freedom includes more than economic freedom,'' the
president said. ``In America, we believe it is indivisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke for 30 minutes, then took questions for another
half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the United States sought to isolate China through
security agreements with Japan and arms sales to Taiwan, he
answered: ``It is not fair to say that either Japan or the United
States have a security relationship that is designed to contain
China,'' and added that American policy posed no obstacle to the
peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Another student followed up with a challenging question about
whether the president, despite his smile, intended to pursue a
policy of containment of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is no,'' Clinton said. ``I'm not hiding another
design behind the smile. That's what I really believe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing University speech offered a coda to a series of
weekend meetings with Jiang and other top government leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, Clinton and Jiang continued their dialogue at
a private dinner, exploring in greater depth the growth of the
United States-China relationship and possible paths of China's
future.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was the last meeting of the two presidents on
Clinton's nine-day, five-city visit to China, which has seen a
significant step forward in relations both between the two nations
and between their leaders. Aides called the evening ``very casual
and very lively.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday began with a service at Chongwenmen Church and ended with
the dinner, attended by the presidents' wives and a few top
advisers. The day also included an afternoon of touristic
diversions to the Forbidden City and the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, in the Zhongnanhai compound for Beijing's political
elite, included discussion of the Asian financial crisis,
development of an independent judiciary in China and American
movies. Jiang recalled enjoying ``Gone with the Wind'' several
years ago in Shanghai, according to an American official who
attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went way beyond what people thought were the
possibilities of having this kind of discussion,'' Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said of the two days of meetings between
the two presidents. ``We have moved the relationship into a
qualitatively and quantitatively different direction.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Albright and other American officials were still clearly elated
by the news conference on Saturday in which Clinton and Jiang
engaged in an animated debate on topics that for years were not the
subject of public discussion _ religious freedom, Tibet and the
role of the individual and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press conference was a truly remarkable event and one that
is going to have long-term repercussions _ positive ones,''
Albright said in a session with reporters at the Diaoyutai state
guest compound here. But in a reminder that not everything has
changed in China, American security officials had posted a notice
on the wall of the room where Albright spoke, reading, ``The walls
have ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright and two other American officials _ Sandy Berger, the
national security adviser, and James Sasser, the ambassador to
China _ said on Sunday that 600 million Chinese had seen the news
conference, carried live on China Central Television, the state
network.
</P>
<P>
   That number seemed a significant exaggeration, given that there
are an estimated 300 million television sets in China and there was
no advance notice that the news conference would be carried live.
It was difficult to find Chinese who had seen the live broadcast,
and state television rebroadcast only selected portions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Sunday, the president and his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, attended services at Chongwenmen Church, the largest
officially sanctioned Protestant church in Beijing, with more than
2,000 members. The congregation gave Clinton a bilingual Bible and
asked him to speak to the overflow crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate with you the growth of the practice of our faith
in China,'' Clinton said in remarks that lasted less than five
minutes. ``I believe our faith calls upon us to seek unity with
people across the world with different backgrounds and races and
creeds.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I believe Chinese and Americans are brothers and
sisters as children of God. We come here in that spirit today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea, spent Sunday afternoon
touring the Forbidden City and the section of the Great Wall at
Mutianyu. The authorities cleared the Forbidden City complex for
the Clintons, only the third time they have done so, American
officials said. The previous times were for a tour by President
Richard Nixon and for the making of the film ``The Last Emperor.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the wall ``quite unbelievable.''

FATHER (AND SON) KNOWS BEST FOR INVESTMENT SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE -- Their office is on a quaint, residential
road, not Wall Street. They work out of a charming home overlooking
the Angeles National Forest, not a sleek building in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   But while they may be far from the nation's financial capital,
the father-son team of Robert and Reed Bender are making their own
waves in this suburb northeast of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Their money management firm, Robert Bender &AMP; Associates, has
outperformed the majority of its peers. Since the firm opened in
1972, it has garnered an average annual return of 22 percent among
its managed accounts, beating the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, a
benchmark of the U.S. stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Bender &AMP; Associates currently manages $173 million from 330
clients -- minimum to join is $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, they were tapped by the Santa Barbara Group of
Mutual Funds in Los Angeles to manage the Bender Growth Fund, a $10
million mid-cap fund. Though its fees are higher than the average
fund, its no-load shares have returned a respectable 41.5 percent
since 1996; good, but not quite the S&AMP;P 500's 51 percent return.
</P>
<P>
   Their portfolios perform in part because they're aggressive
managers, unafraid to take greater risks with investments, said
Peter Walker, publisher of Money Manager Review, a San Francisco
publication that tracks manager performance.
</P>
<P>
   Money Manager ranks the company first among balanced (stocks and
bonds) managers with a 59.64 percent return for the 12 months ended
March 31, and third among equity managers with a 76.51 percent
return over the same period.
</P>
<P>
   Their success stems from Robert Bender's nit-picky investment
strategy. Only a handful of stocks a year pass enough muster to be
added to their portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find investments,'' said the 61-year-old former
aerospace executive. ``We're extremely particular.''
</P>
<P>
   They are so picky that they only have 34 stocks in their mutual
fund and 22 among their individually managed accounts. Almost half
of the Bender fund is invested in tech stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike managers who chase the latest trends, the Benders like to
pick stocks they hope will perform in the long-term regardless of
stock market swings. For instance, while financial services stocks
are currently popular because of the mergers within the industry,
the Benders won't buy any that don't meet their investment model.
</P>
<P>
   They are strictly fundamental analysts, judging companies on
market factors as well as company performance and management.
Technical analysis, on the other hand, looks at a stock's volume,
momentum and other quantifiable factors before making a buy or sell
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most money managers, they also have a remarkably low 10
percent turnover, meaning that only one-tenth of their holdings on
the average are bought or sold each year. Fewer trades means less
capital gains, resulting in less taxes to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Most mutual fund managers change their holdings more frequently,
some with a 100 percent turnover or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``You buy good companies, you stick with them,'' said co-manager
Reed Bender, 30. ``They can't do it every quarter but they can do
it in the long-term.''
</P>
<P>
   Their strategy is to hold stocks for five to seven years _
almost an eternity among fund managers. They're not concerned with
the vicissitudes of the market at any given moment, since they
believe they've picked good companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the No. 1s and No. 2s in the industry, not the 10s and
12s,'' said the senior Bender.
</P>
<P>
   They start with a close examination of the economy's growth to
identify promising industries in which to invest, such as computer
networking. They then identify the companies they consider to be
top players in that market.
</P>
<P>
   The Benders prefer firms in ``pure play,'' or those that derive
about 90 percent of their business from growth within the industry
they're studying. As the market grows, so will the firm, they
reason.
</P>
<P>
   They only buy companies that are profitable, with at least a 20
percent growth in earnings per share. Profit growth should come
with revenue increases from the core business, to make sure that
bottom-line boosts are a result of operations, not from
cost-cutting or acquisitions. The company also can't be saddled
with too much debt and must be a leader in its industry.
</P>
<P>
   Their painstaking research includes not only analyzing company
operations and marketability of products, but chats with key
executives, customers and visits to headquarters and stores. They
take analysts' reports with a grain of salt, since most analysts
work for companies that have investment banking divisions, which
can have a financial stake in a company.
</P>
<P>
   However, profit increases still are key.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks go up on earnings growth. That's the bottom line,''
said Reed Bender, relaxing in his den office. ``I don't care what
the market does.''

LA CANADA FLINTRIDGE, Calif.: the market does.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Such thinking led them to Cisco, now a high-flier in the
computer networking field, which they first bought in 1990 for 80
cents a share, adjusted for splits. The company closed at $89~ on
Friday. Cisco is the best maker of routers, and Lucent and Nortel
are chasing it, the younger Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   They also bought Microsoft for as low as $3 a share and Home
Depot for $4, adding to their positions as the companies grew.
</P>
<P>
   The Benders do buy companies in slower-growing industries such
as retail. But their strategy is to buy the best-managed ones.
</P>
<P>
   However, they don't like cyclical industries, such as
semiconductors where firms can be dependent on product
introductions. Intel is one such company. Even if it has most of
the world's personal computer chip market, it's languishing now
because of problems with its new chip. Years ago, it rose high with
the Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a boom and bust cycle,'' Reed Bender said.
</P>
<P>
   They sell if they feel the firm can't meet their stringent
criteria anymore, such as Wal-Mart. Robert Bender identified
Wal-Mart as a good stock in 1980 and it performed well for them
over the years. But they dumped the stock in 1994 when growth
started slowing down. This year they sold Sun Microsystems, the
developer of the Java computer language, because the company's
growth is expected to slow.
</P>
<P>
   But they're holding onto Microsoft, despite its antitrust
problems. There's no threat to its operating system dominance and
it's well-positioned in the Internet marketplace as well, Reed
Bender said. Netscape, whose browser is Microsoft's chief
competitor in the Internet marketplace, is bound to be overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't (buy) companies that compete with Microsoft,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   They also steer clear of many Internet companies, such as search
engine makers, since many aren't profitable. Most foreign stocks
are a no-no as well, because there are too many factors a money
manager has to watch for, such as currency risks, political
stability and adequate regulatory oversight.
</P>
<P>
   They prefer companies that supply infrastructure to a growing
industry. One such favorite is Quintiles Transnational, a contract
research company.
</P>
<P>
   The Benders don't like biotechnology stocks, since they are
dependent on FDA approvals. But they favor a company like
Quintiles, which provides FDA testing and application support for
biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Whether or not a company
receives FDA approval, Quintiles still gets the business.
</P>
<P>
   But they've bought into some dogs as well. One loser was
Versatility, a company whose systems help customer service
representatives identify products purchased, computers used and
details of the last service call when a customer phones in. But
business did not develop as they had hoped. They bought the stock
several times at an average price of $10 and bailed out at $6 a
share.
</P>
<P>
   As for future plans, Robert Bender does not intend to open more
offices than the one he has at home in La Canada Flintridge and a
marketing office in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more peaceful and I don't want to waste time traveling,''
he said.

IT'S A SUMMER SMASH 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ My 10-year-old son, Sam, isn't much of a newspaper
reader yet, but finally he has something to check every morning
when the Globe is plopped on our walkway.
</P>
<P>
   Did McGwire hit another one? How many is that?
</P>
<P>
   If you are a baseball fan, it is the first thing you look for
when the morning paper arrives. And it is often the lead story of
the day when ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' loops back at the top of the
hour.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it's going to go for the rest of the baseball
season, right up until some time in September when _ barring
injuries, of course _ Mark McGwire hits home run No. 62, shattering
Roger Maris's record set in the asterisk summer of 1961.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, 1961. As it was then, it is today ...
</P>
<P>
   ... John Glenn is preparing for a space flight, there's a young
singer named Dylan making noise, the Green Bay Packers are the most
feared team in the NFL, there's a Democrat in the White House who
vacations on the Cape and Islands ... and someone's on pace to set
the major league single-season home run record.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals played their 80th game Sunday and are off Monday.
They reach their official midseason Tuesday night at home against
the Kansas City Royals. McGwire already has 36 homers, which means
he'll project to at least 72 when the St. Louis halftime whistle
blows.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lurking not far behind we have Chicago Cub Sammy Sosa
with 32 home runs, including a big-league-record 19 (and counting)
in the month of June. And then there's Ken Griffey, who Sunday hit
his 32d for the Seattle Mariners in their 82d game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, Sosa, Griffey. Three guys with a legitimate shot to
beat Maris. There have been threats in the past, but never this
many this far into the season, with these kinds of numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It's incredible when one realizes that Maris's record has stood
longer than Ruth's. The Babe hit 60 in the summer of 1927 and it
was 34 years later that Maris hit No. 61. The much-maligned Maris
never again reached those heights, never made the Hall of Fame, and
died of cancer, but his record has lasted 38 years, four more than
the Babe's.
</P>
<P>
   Back in '61, the Red Sox were part of homer history because it
was a Boston rookie righty, Tracy Stallard, who served up the final
meatball in the Yankees' 162d game of the season (Tom Zachary
surrendered No. 60 to Ruth in '27). All good New Yorkers know that
the Maris homer ball was caught by Sal Durante, a truck-driving
teenager from Coney Island. Durante collected a $5,000 reward put
up by a Sacramento restaurateur and happily gave the ball to Maris.
When Cal Ripken homered in his 2,131st consecutive game in 1995,
the fan who caught the ball wanted more money than Bill Gates has.
</P>
<P>
   Stallard lives in Virginia and will need an unlisted phone
number when McGwire gets near 60. The Red Sox this time will be a
safe distance from history: Boston finishes with Seattle in August
and the Sox don't play the Cardinals or Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Babe's widow was interviewed regularly during Maris's '61
chase and told reporters that she didn't want Maris to hit 60. She
said it was the record her husband loved best. Maris was forever
haunted by the chase, and by the charges that his record was
tainted because he did it in a 162-game season, as opposed to
Ruth's 154-game slate.
</P>
<P>
   Maris in '61 played 10 more games than Ruth in '27, but came to
the plate only six more times. Like McGwire this year, Maris had
the advantage of hitting in an expansion season against plenty of
pitchers who would have been in Triple A or retired if not for the
addition of two new rosters.
</P>
<P>
   We are reminded that Reggie Jackson had 37 homers at the
All-Star break in 1969 and wound up with ``only'' 47. The second
half is harder.
</P>
<P>
   But this time it's really going to happen. One or two of the
above sluggers could be stopped by injury or slump, but it's highly
doubtful that all three will come up short. McGwire hit 58 last
year. Griffey was on a pace to smash the mark when the strike hit
in '94.
</P>
<P>
   This is the year Maris's record falls. Just ask Sam.

RED SOX HIT LOW SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Red Sox pitcher Derek Lowe wasted a splendid opportunity
to lift whatever curse is dogging him during this season of no
wins.
</P>
<P>
   Here, in the one American city that has more in common with the
Caribbean than the Corn Belt, your neighbors don't look twice if
you sacrifice pigs, chickens, goats, or the nearest household pet
as an appeal to the gods for relief from ill fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe passed on the voodoo, however, and elected to shoulder the
burden for Sunday's 5-1 loss to the Florida Marlins, which dropped
his record to 0-7 and threatens to leave the 6-foot-6-inch
righthander with a permanent stoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is killing me,'' Lowe said after once again pitching just
well enough to lose, this time to Ryan Dempster, a 21-year-old
rookie who was making just his sixth start and hadn't won yet,
either, until holding the Red Sox to four hits and a run in seven
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems like every time I go out there somebody with an 0-3
record and a 9.00 ERA goes out there and throws by far his best
game,'' Lowe said. ``I don't know if it's bad luck, or whatever.
It's a strange game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the last game of an odd bit of scheduling in which the
Red Sox endured a 19-game stretch in which they were home for two
short sets totaling five games while playing 14 on the road. They
actually survived quite well, winning 12 of the 19, batting .294,
and compiling a staff ERA of 4.07.
</P>
<P>
   After an off-day Monday, they go into the All-Star break with
six games at home, beginning Tuesday with a three-game set against
Montreal, but it will be a short respite. After the break, they
play 12 of their next 14 and 24 of their next 30 on the road before
unpacking their suitcases for any length of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day off will probably be good for us,'' manager Jimy
Williams said. ``We've got a few guys banged up.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are starting to show signs of attrition. With Mo
Vaughn down with a strained hamstring and Reggie Jefferson
recovering from a beaning, Williams started an infield that
featured four guys who have all played shortstop, including Mike
Benjamin, who was at first base, the firmest sign yet that the Red
Sox fancy newcomer Billy Ashley as a DH and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   The regular shortstop, Nomar Garciaparra, batted cleanup and
doubled and scored in the second inning on Benjamin's single. The
hit extended Garciaparra's streak to 20 games, matching Larry
Walker for longest streak in the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know him from Adam,'' Marlins manager Jim Leyland said
of Garciaparra, who had seven hits and was on base nine times in
three games against Floirida, ``but he's a real ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks to me like he's lived before. Does Jimy (Williams)
room together with m? They ought to. You don't let that guy get
away. He's a trophy bass.''
</P>
<P>
   But that second-inning uprising was the best the Red Sox could
muster Sunday. Rookie Lou Merloni struck out with runners on the
corners in the sixth. Pinch hitter Damon Buford and Darren Lewis
were retired with a runner on third in the seventh. Darren Bragg,
facing reliever Antonio Alfonseca, struck out with the bases loaded
in the eighth, an inning in which Garciaparra also whiffed against
the Marlins' six-fingered man, who is called ``El Pulpo'' (The
Octopus).
</P>
<P>
   Lowe put himself in a 2-0 hole in the first inning, when he gave
up a single, a walk, and Cliff Floyd's two-run triple. He fell
behind, 3-1, in the third when his wild pitch allowed Edgar
Renteria, who had doubled, to walk home from third. He was gone in
the fifth, when he loaded the bases after two were out with a
single and two walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hurt myself by walking (Todd) Zeile after I had him down 1
and 2,'' Lowe said. ``It could have been a very easy inning. I got
two quick outs on five pitches, and then turned it into a
marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins seemed intent on sparing Lowe some agony when Mark
Kotsay, the runner on first, broke for second after he saw Edgar
Renteria, the runner already occupying that base, make a move
toward third. But Renteria was merely bluffing, which should have
made Kotsay a pigeon for catcher Scott Hatteberg.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatteberg, after taking a few steps toward second, threw to
second baseman Merloni, allowing Kotsay free passage back to first.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was terrible,'' Hatteberg said. ``All my fault. I ran out
there but I should have kept running toward first. Lou didn't have
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally screwed up. It was totally my fault that Derek
didn't get to stay in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Lowe has any evidence to suggest the outcome would have
been any different had he lingered on the scene. He has allowed
three runs or fewer in each of his last five starts, of which this
was the briefest, and nothing to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm going out there thinking I have to throw a
shutout every time, but in the back of my mind I don't want to give
up too many runs, so I'm trying to make the perfect pitch and it's
backfiring,'' Lowe said. ``I'm getting into too many high pitch
counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know what else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And on he went to the plane. Too late to stop at the chicken
coop.

STEWART GOES DISTANCE IN N.E. 200 
</HEADLINE>
 ENGLAND 200-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Eighteen laps remained in Sunday's Indy Racing
League event at New Hampshire International Speedway when Tony
Stewart said he began his countdown. It was, after all, only two
years ago in the inaugural IRL race at NHIS that Stewart was in the
midst of a runaway victory _ he led for 165 laps and was five
seconds from putting the field three laps down _ when his engine
quit 18 laps from the finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an electronic crank trigger,'' Stewart recalled. ``It's
right in the heart of the engine and when it quit, it just shut the
motor off.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart experienced no such problems Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was difficult for him not to keep a keen ear on his
engine as he counted off the final 18 laps en route to victory in
the New England 200 at NHIS before a crowd estimated by track
officials to be 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he experienced any false alarms in his final 18-lap
tour of the 1-mile oval at NHIS, Stewart said, ``No, but I heard
every little thing that happened. I could tell you every time a
valve closed, I could hear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chimed in car owner John Menard, ``I could hear it in the
pits.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Larry (Curry, team manager for Team Menard) in the last
five laps I probably created more noises in my head that probably
weren't happening,'' said Stewart, who led twice for 93 laps and
inherited the lead for good from teammate Robbie Buhl, last year's
winner, on Lap 163. ``I was counting laps. From 18 down, I was
counting 'em. I had my spotter and Larry both tell me how many laps
we had. They both said 20, so two laps later I started counting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even act like we won the race until I knew we could
coast across without getting passed,'' he added. ``I didn't want to
even think that, coming off of (Turn) 4, we had it won, because I
didn't know if I could coast that far and still win. So, until we
got there, I wasn't counting anything in the bag yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In recording his second IRL triumph of the season, and second in
a row at NHIS for Team Menard, Stewart finished ahead of a pair of
Great Scotts _ runner-up Scott Goodyear and third-place finisher
Scott Sharp, who entered the race tied with Stewart in the IRL
points standings at 115 but now trails by 17 (167-150).
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who earned $122,950, will not likely be back to defend
his title next year since he will be driving for Joe Gibbs on the
NASCAR Winston Cup circuit. But, even if he weren't, it's likely he
would not have returned to NHIS with the IRL, whose three-year
contract with the track expired with Sunday's race. Because of
sagging attendance figures, which experienced a decline Sunday for
the third year in a row, it's not likely that the IRL will be back
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great race track,'' said Menard, who has had two of
his four career IRL triumphs at NHIS. ``We really enjoy it. I feel
bad that more spectators don't share my enthusiasm for this
track.''
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't blame Billy Boat if he wasn't eager to return to
NHIS. After winning the pole position Saturday in record fashion
with a lap of 162.146 miles per hour, Boat twice experienced
calamity in Turn 2. The A.J. Foyt driver spun there on Lap 32 then,
on Lap 95, was involved in a four-car crash and suffered a broken
left thigh when his car was broadsided by Raul Boesel. Boat was
transported to Concord Hospital, where he remained Sunday night
under observation. He will be transferred Monday to Methodist
Hospital in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main focus right now is on Billy and his family,'' said
Tommy LaMance, team manager for A.J. Foyt Enterprises. ``When we
are clear about his condition then we'll go back and evaluate
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Boat's accident wound up being the worst mishap of the race,
which was marred by six caution periods totaling 50 laps.
</P>
<P>
   Twice this season, Stewart has failed to reach the finish line
of a race, including the Indianapolis 500. But Sunday Stewart
seemed to put all those frustrations behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope so,'' he said. ``I mean, this is definitely a momentum
booster just like I said after we won Orlando and after we ran
second at Phoenix. It just proves that if we don't break, we can
win races and finish on the podium. This team is capable of winning
races everywhere we go, it's just a matter of getting a little luck
on our side, and today we really had the luck.''

OVERTIME SUCCESS FOR FRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENS, France _ Tout le monde will be jumping on the France
bandwagon now. Les Bleus officially captured the imagination of
their own country Sunday with a 1-0 overtime win over Paraguay,
their fourth in succession, setting up a quarterfinal meeting
against Italy Friday at Saint-Denis.
</P>
<P>
   The French have become a team worth embracing _ the most solid
of defenses, able and willing attackers, propelled by the momentum
of the enthusiastic support of a crowd of 41,275 at Stade Felix
Bollaert, which sang the most serious of ``La Marseillaise'' after
a good-natured ``Joyeux Anniversaire'' salute to goalkeeper Fabian
Barthez.
</P>
<P>
   If any team can unite France, it could be this one. Only the
most xenophobic of Front National members could be unimpressed by
this team's diversity. Coach Aimee Jacquet's team is composed of
first-generation immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean,
offspring of Argentinians, Armenians, Basques, and Portuguese, plus
some stereotypical Gallic descendents of Vercingetorix, such as
Laurent Blanc, author of the 117th-minute goal Sunday. And they are
about to be reinforced by their best, the suspended Zinedine
Zidane, the most famous Algerian-French footballer since Albert
Camus.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been difficult to imagine France failing against
Paraguay, but the French were less than four minutes away from a
penalty kick showdown against Jose Luis Chilavert, one of the most
dominating figures in this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Chilavert almost controlled the pace of the game from the goal
by his sheer presence. Chilavert's intimidating demeanor is
palpable. He is built like a heavyweight boxer _ 6 feet 2 inches,
204 pounds _ and he has punched out everyone from journalists to
opponents to the bodyguards of presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Chilavert punched away French chances in regulation time
but was a gracious villain as he helped up Youri Djorkaeff after a
second-half collision.
</P>
<P>
   But, though Chilavert was prepared to go a few more rounds, his
teammates wearied, and France reinforced the attack with Stephane
Guivarc'h and Robert Pires, plus midfielder Alain Boghossian, then
brought Blanc up from deep central defense.
</P>
<P>
   France kept the ball in the air, and when Paraguay finally
appeared tired of heading out of danger, Pires and David Trezeguet
combined to set up Blanc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very difficult match,'' Jacquet said. ``We
dominated the match, but in a match like that, where everything is
closed down, you never know what will happen. We were lacking some
confidence, and that is what happens when you play a team like
Paraguay that seals itself off like an impenetrable wall.''
</P>
<P>
   The Paraguayans made life difficult for both France and referee
Ali Mohamed Bujsaim of the United Arab Emirates. They delayed and
attempted to frustrate the French, who have their own
self-destructive tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Though France's players were supposed to be the more
sophisticated, the Paraguayans took better advantage of an
incredibly underqualified refereeing crew, which consisted of
linesmen from Sri Lanka and Vanuatu, countries that are oceans away
from the high-level professional leagues. In the first half,
Djorkaeff actually grabbed a linesman's arm in attempt to force him
to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Chilavert and central defenders Celso Ayala and Carlos Gamarra
kept the goal area secure. And Paraguay's swarming tactics stifled
the creativity of Djorkaeff and highlighted the absence of Zidane.
</P>
<P>
   Lilian Thuram provided some powerful penetrations from the back,
and France had several near misses in the run of play in regulation
time, the best by Thierry Henry off the far post in the 38th minute
and Djorkaeff's drive that was headed over the bar by Julio Cesar
Enciso 32 minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Late in regulation time, with the crowd chanting ``Youri,''
Djorkaeff nearly decided the contest. He directed a free kick
toward the far post, curling away from Chilavert, who dove to clear
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``France got a little desperate, but we were really tired,''
said Paraguay's Brazilian coach, Paulo Cesar Carpeggiani. ``But
it's normal to get tired at the end of a game like that. We thought
we would have a better chance of winning if it went to penalty
kicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Paraguay went to a fifth defender midway through the second
half, as Denis Caniza replaced Carlos Paredes, a 21-year-old
midfield creator from Olimpia in Asuncion who has been among
Paraguay's most impressive performers in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The insistent pressure and strength of France caused the
Paraguayans to visibly tire. Several collapsed after Blanc's shot
hit the back of the net, leading to a moving scene in which
Chilavert consoled and encouraged his teammates while pulling them
to their feet.
</P>
<P>
   France has never advanced past the semifinals, and if any of the
French are withholding their support, it is because they are wary
of being let down again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a great matchup with Italy,'' Jacquet said. ``They
are our dear friends, and we have a lot of players playing there.''

HALL BECKONS BIRD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Larry Bird will get the word Monday. The Hall of Fame
will announce that its panel of 24 anonymous voters has deemed that
Bird, having waited the minimum five years, has been inducted.
</P>
<P>
   It is as close to a lock as one can find. Bird retired at the
end of the 1992 season and became eligible for consideration this
year. The results will be announced Monday, with the induction
ceremony scheduled for Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   It's never easy to predict how the vote will go, but this one
isn't in doubt. Bird will become the 19th Celtic player to be so
honored, although some, such as Bill Walton, Tiny Archibald, Pete
Maravich, and Dave Bing, established themselves as stars long
before joining the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of soup-to-nuts Celtics, Bird will join K.C. Jones, Tom
Heinsohn, Frank Ramsey, Sam Jones, John Havlicek, and Bill Russell
as honorees (Bob Cousy played seven games with the 1969-70
Cincinnati Royals, Dave Cowens played 40 ill-advised games with
1982-83 Milwaukee Bucks, and Bill Sharman played 31 games for the
1950-51 Washington Caps.). Red Auerbach was inducted as a coach.
</P>
<P>
   Of the above players, only Russell and Havlicek were inducted in
their first year of eligibility. Heinsohn, for instance, retired in
1965 but was not selected until 1986. Ramsey was selected in 1981,
17 years after he retired.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the Hall of Fame admits at least three nominees from
the regular category and one each from the women's, veterans, and
international categories. Bird is one of four first-time nominees
in the regular category, along with Adrian Dantley, Chet Walker,
and former Harlem Globetrotter Marques Haynes. The others are Larry
Costello, Artis Gilmore, Gus Johnson, Sidney Moncrief and coaches
Alex Hannum, John Thompson of Georgetown and Tex Winter, the man
behind the world champion Bulls' triple-post offense.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, Gilmore had a cup of coffee with the Celtics in the
1987-88 season, while Thompson played 74 games for the Celtics in
1964-66 before going on to bigger and better things with the Hoyas.
</P>
<P>
   Two women are nominated: Jody Conradt, the head coach at Texas
the past 22 seasons, and Harley Redin, who coached at Wayland
Baptist. Nominated in the veterans category are Grady Lewis, a shoe
company executive, and Arnie Risen, who ended his 13-year NBA
career in 1958 with the Celtics. The nominees in the international
category are Yugoslavian coach Aleksandar Nikolic and Ubiratan
Pereira Maciel of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Bird needs no introduction to Boston fans and will likely be
joined next year by Kevin McHale, his running mate for most of his
Boston career. McHale retired after the 1992-93 season.
</P>
<P>
   Bird joined the Celtics in 1979 and was the near-unanimous
choice for Rookie of the Year, well ahead of Magic Johnson. He
earned three consecutive Most Valuable Player titles in 1984-86 and
led the Celtics to three world championships, gaining the Finals
MVP in two of those years (1984, 1986.) He was a 12-time All-Star
and still holds or shares 27 Celtics records.
</P>
<P>
   His final two years were cut short by back pain which forced his
retirement. But before retiring, he was a member of the first (and
true) Dream Team at the 1992 Olympics, winning a gold medal. He was
retained by the Celtics as a consultant following his retirement,
but grew disenchanted with his role in the organization. He left
last year to accept the head coaching job and part ownership of the
Indiana Pacers and guided the team to the Eastern Conference
finals, earning Coach of the Year honors.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ She's hardly a household name on the WTA Tour, with
just one tournament victory to her credit, but Monica Seles is more
than familiar with Sandrine Testud.
</P>
<P>
   Seles, who plays Testud in her fourth-round match Monday at
Wimbledon, lost to the Frenchwoman in the third round here last
year and again in the Italian Open in May. That was just before
Seles lost to Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the final of the French
Open.
</P>
<P>
   So Seles didn't take Sunday off. She hit for about 30 minutes,
trying to keep her game sharp.
</P>

   ``I think both of us are playing better,'' said Seles, the No. 6
seed. ``I'm definitely playing better, but I also feel Sandrine has
improved, too. So maybe the better one of us will win. I'm just
going to go out there and take it a ball at a time and do some
things differently than I did the last time.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very good fighter, she's good from both sides, and she
has a good serve. So I'm just going to have to play my game at a
higher level. I'm going to have to attack, serve well, and go for
my shots. I'm just going to have to attack and attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Testud, seeded 14th and ranked 13th in the world, has won
$177,887 this season. Seles, who hasn't won a tournament, is fifth
ranked and has earned $353,303.
</P>
<P>
   Testud, who earned $417,753 last year while having her best
season (44-23 record), made it to two finals, winning at Palermo
and losing at Atlanta. She also made the quarterfinals in seven
other events, including the US Open as well as the Lipton
Invitational. She has not lost a set in three matches at Wimbledon.
But neither has Seles.
</P>
<P>
   The seemingly even matchup between Seles and Testud symbolizes
the depth of women's tennis. With close to a dozen top players,
there is plenty of talent for fans to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The marketing of players also has never been better. Martina
Hingis, Anna Kournikova, Venus Williams, and Lindsay Davenport are
among the younger players who have made headlines and captured the
imagination of the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's such a great point that if we don't really
take advantage of it, we never will,'' Seles said. ``I think our
new CEO (Bartlett H. McGuire) is doing a great job, so hopefully it
will continue. I just think the variety is so much better on the
court, off the court, and terms of personalities and games, too.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest names ever in women's tennis was knocked out
of the tournament last Friday when Steffi Graf lost in straight
sets. Seles saw only the final game of Graf's 6-4, 7-5 loss to
Natasha Zvereva.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always hard to say what will happen because I didn't see
the match,'' Seles said. ``We all watch the final game in the
locker room and I thought she just played some great tennis. But I
was just really happy for Natasha because I know it's tough when
you play somebody like 15 or 16 times in a row and you lose to
them, and I always thought Natasha has some of the best hands in
world, and it was just nice to see that she put it all together and
in a really good place, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Graf, who has been plagued with knee injuries, has thought
seriously about retiring. It's something the other tour players
discuss often.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Steffi, it's going to be tough for her to come back to the
level that she was, obviously, but, knowing her, she is such a
perfectionist that she'll try,'' Seles said. ``So I really think
that she's still going to keep on playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles doesn't believe that not having Graf in her draw will mean
very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's always the match. I mean, gee, if I can get
through the Testud match, that's the biggest, before I start
thinking about Steffi,'' Seles said. ``The way Natasha played
(against Graf), she could beat any of us. So you don't look that
far ahead. I can just see what the players are saying, but until I
see it with my own eyes, I would just prefer not to say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Seles is hoping that her game will say it all this
week.

THOUSANDS TURN OUT FOR FESTIVE EXPRESSION OF GAY PRIDE
</HEADLINE>

(EDITORS: rewords 26th graf) 
BY MELISSA SCHMITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES -- Teen-agers across the San Fernando Valley are
scrambling to get their driver's permits before Wednesday, the day
California will dramatically change a rite of passage teens live
for -- obtaining a driver's license.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joining 21 other states across the country, California is
toughening teen driving laws in an attempt to cut roadway
fatalities caused by exuberant young drivers.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Motor Vehicles, motorists 15 to
19 years old make up only 4 percent of California's drivers. But
that 4 percent was involved in 8.8 percent of all fatal collisions
in the state in 1996 and 9.9 percent of all injury collisions.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to slash the number of teen-agers dying due to
avoidable traffic collisions, the state is putting into effect a
new licensing program that will extend from 30 days to six months
the amount of time a 16- or 17-year-old driver will have to hold a
permit before obtaining a full-fledged license.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen and 17-year-olds who obtained their permits before
Wednesday are not affected by the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Those who fall under the new law will have to get in 50 hours of
supervised driving time, including 10 hours at night.
</P>
<P>
   For the first year they hold a driver's license, minor drivers
will have to be accompanied by a parent or guardian when driving
between midnight and 5 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps most painful to the teen-ager, the law says teen
drivers cannot transport passengers under 20 years of age for the
first six months, unless supervised.
</P>
<P>
   That's a major bummer in the eyes of most teens, who see the
driver's license as their personal emancipation proclamation.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Koscielny, 16, of Saugus High School in suburban Santa
Clarita, is one of those not greeting the new laws with open arms,
even though she received her learner's permit in the 11th hour of
the July 1 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's good that we have a little more time,'' Koscielny
said, referring to the 50 hours of training and the extended
learner's permit. As for the law prohibiting teens from driving
their friends around: ``I don't like that part,'' she said. ``I
don't think that's right.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sally Reed, director of the California Department of Motor
Vehicles, said the restrictions are in place to keep young people
like Koscielny, and others driving on the road with them, safe
until they get their bearings behind the wheel of a car.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are common-sense restrictions that affect the times and
situations when teens are in the most danger,'' Reed said. ``They
make good sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Western Insurance Information Service, a nonprofit consumer
education organization, said a similar program in Canada proves
they make good sense. That program has been credited with a 55
percent reduction in fatalities involving 16-year-olds, a Western
Insurance spokesman said. The other 21 programs in the United
States are too new to evaluate.
</P>
<P>
   Judi Umeck of Santa Clarita is friends with Koscielny's mother.
And Umeck, like her friend, has worried for months about the safety
of her daughter on the road. The two women, like many others they
know, have their own rules for their driving daughters.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the alarming statistics of crashes and collisions
involving teen-age drivers are much more than numbers to mothers of
16-year-olds.
</P>
<P>
   Umeck's daughter has lost friends at the rate of one per year
for the last three years to traffic crashes, numbers that simply
hit too close to home.
</P>
<P>
   None of the three fatal crashes would have been directly
prevented by the new restrictions governing teen drivers. They
didn't occur during the restricted hours or with other young people
in the car. Nevertheless, to Umeck and her 16-year-old daughter,
they are a painful symbol of why restrictions are needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad they're doing something,'' said Umeck, who is on
staff at Providence High School in Burbank. ``It's fine to have
more restraints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of us have already implemented that anyway. My daughter
isn't allowed to take more than one friend at a time. When I see
five or six kids in a car with a teen driver at one time, it scares
me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Umeck's daughter Erin, 16, agrees with her mother _ to some
extent, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways it's good,'' said Erin, who also got her license
just under the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people go out partying, but say you're coming home from a
party or the movies, and you're going straight home instead of out
cruising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point of my getting my license was so I could run
errands for my parents,'' she said. ``I'm a baby-sitter. And I take
this little girl to Magic Mountain. The new laws would be just like
having a permit instead of having a license.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I already have my license, it doesn't affect me,'' she said.
``I knew and that's why I took my classes over spring break.''
</P>
<P>
   In order to beat Wednesday's deadline, Erin didn't wait to take
driver training in school, where the program takes place over the
summer. Instead, she took her training as soon as the law would
allow.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finished I had just turned 16. I practiced every chance
I had,'' she said, explaining the sense of urgency she felt.
</P>
<P>
   But the teen said she understands the need for the laws, as
frustrating as they are.
</P>
<P>
   When young people like her classmates die, it's a tragedy Erin
said she could live without. More so than living without the
privilege of driving her friends around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I feel I kind of agree with them. I do think we
all need to understand the responsibility, and we shouldn't be
abusing it,'' Erin said. ``Accidents can happen.''

NIGERIA CAN'T COPE WITH GREAT DANE ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAINT-DENIS, France _ Even after they did it, they couldn't say
how they did it or where it came from. Denmark (yes, that Denmark)
4, Nigeria 1?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why it should be like this suddenly, it is impossible to
say,'' shrugged coach Bo Johansson, after his lightly regarded side
had ripped the wings off the favored Super Eagles in the Stade de
France Sunday night and won a date with defending champion Brazil
in the World Cup quarterfinals. ``You never know. You can't really
say such things.''
</P>
<P>
   How did a team that had managed only three goals in its first
three matches score two in the first dozen minutes? By doing what
most people are reluctant to do against the fleet Nigerians: Go
straight to their goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Danes went right at the Nigerians and it paid off almost
immediately, as Peter Moller (third minute) and Brian Laudrup
(12th) put the ball in the back of the net. The Super Eagles, in
shock, never regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lose concentration after 2-0 and it was very difficult to
do something different,'' said coach Bora Milutinovic, after
Nigeria had gone out in the second round for the second straight
time. ``I am not happy to finish the World Cup in this way.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody thought the Super Eagles would, not after beating seeded
Spain and 1994 semifinalist Bulgaria in their group. They were the
team nobody wanted to play, the team the French were delighted to
avoid. Everyone this side of Copenhagen (and most folks there)
figured Denmark was just a speed bump on the way to a shootout with
Brazil on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Danes had come slouching into the second round after tying
South Africa and losing to France. After a dozen years away from
the tournament, that seemed to be enough for them. So Johansson had
let them relax over the weekend, working them lightly.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the Danes took the field Sunday night, they were
brisk and bold. As soon as they saw the Nigerian defense playing
loose, they lofted a long ball to captain Michael Laudrup, who
dashed past two defenders and tapped the ball across to Moller, who
blasted it past keeper Peter Rufai.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't figure to be a problem for the Super Eagles, who
usually play with more urgency and muscle and invention when
they're a goal down. But before Nigeria could crank up the war
chariot, it was 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   After Moller blew a free kick through the wall and off Rufai's
hands, an unmarked Brian Laudrup pounced on the rebound and slammed
it by. No question _ and no fluke. ``Those goals were from
fantastic attacks,'' said Johansson. ``It wasn't luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaken awake, Nigeria came calling again and again. Nwankwo Kanu
sprinted in on a break, but keeper Peter Schmeichel smothered his
bid. Okechukwu Uche kneed one over the crossbar. Kanu misheaded a
lovely cross from Jay-Jay Okocha. Okocha launched a shot just wide,
then put another over the bar. Twenty-five shots Nigeria took, and
all but eight were off target.
</P>
<P>
   The Super Eagles were in a tailspin. Fifteen minutes into the
second half, Denmark's Ebbe ``Sudden Impact'' Sand hurled them to
earth. Sand, who'd been on the pitch for only 22 seconds (and only
16 while the ball was live), took a looping pass from Michael
Laudrup, dropped it from head to right foot, and drilled it through
for 3-0. It was the fastest goal by a substitute in Cup history and
it finished Nigeria for good.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a little bit of the old, famous Danish way of
playing, and it is enormously nice to see,'' mused Johansson, after
Thomas Helveg had made it 4-0 in the 76th minute. ``We played a
couple of fantastic games in 1986. This was a little bit like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the last, and only other time, the Danes were here.
They destroyed Uruguay by five goals, shut out West Germany, then
were blown to bits, 5-1, by the Spanish in the second round. So
their expectations were modest this time _ and still are. ``Beat
Brazil? We have to try,'' Johansson said. ``Nigeria can't try any
more.''

PAIR OF SCOTTS COME UP SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Tony Stewart took off.
</P>
<P>
   The Scotts gave chase.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Goodyear and Scott Sharp took turns leading Sunday's New
England 200. But at the end they and the rest of the Indy Racing
League field were left to follow winner Stewart around New
Hampshire International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   And when the race _ perhaps the last IRL race to be held here _
was over Goodyear had pulled down a season-best second place and
Sharp was third.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp grabbed the lead from Jeff Ward on Lap 19 and then gave it
back when he pitted early on Lap 28.
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear, driving for a first-year team that includes Baltimore
Raven quarterback Jim Harbaugh, moved in front when Ward went out
with engine problems on Lap 55 and then led twice more for a total
of 44 laps.
</P>
<P>
   But eventually, Goodyear ran out of gears.
</P>
<P>
   He lost fifth gear early, but he said that was not a big problem
because he could use sixth gear.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then we came out of the pits with 82 or 88 laps to go and
we only had fourth gear,'' Goodyear said. ``We went in fourth gear
the rest of the way. That cut us down a second or a second and a
half a lap. That dumps so much speed. And I was waiting for the
thing to blow up, but it didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear managed to make one last run at Stewart late in the
race, shaving his lead to 1.3 seconds with 14 laps to go. Still
running in fourth gear, Goodyear hoped one more round of traffic
might appear in front of Stewart to keep the race at Goodyear's
pace. No such luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good race car and was catching up mainly in traffic,''
Goodyear said. ``I didn't need the fifth and sixth gear in traffic;
fourth gear was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   So he looked for more Sunday afternoon cars on the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping for a big gaggle of traffic at the end to give me
a chance to catch him,'' Goodyear said. ``But I didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Sharp felt it was traffic _ specifically the car of
defending champion Robbie Buhl _ that kept him from getting at
Goodyear and let Davey Hamilton close on him near the end of the
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robbie Buhl wouldn't get out of the way,'' Sharp said. ``If
someone is slowing you down a second a lap, someone else is going
to come up on your tail.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp figured he wasn't going to catch Stewart, but he might
have had a shot at Goodyear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a chance,'' Sharp said. ``But once I had that traffic
problem, I had no chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodyear's previous best finish this year was a fourth in the
last race at Texas. He was third in the first IndyCar race here in
1992 behind Bobby Rahal and Michael Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, who won the second race of the season at Phoenix, lost a
little ground to Stewart in the point standings. The two came into
this race tied for first.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Sharp won here when Stewart developed electrical
problems late after nearly running away with the race. Sharp, a
Babson College graduate and native of Norwalk, Conn., missed last
year's race while he recovered from a couple of concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp pulled away from Ward with a nice restart on Lap 19. He
held the lead until the next caution flag on Lap 28 when he dropped
into the pits for four tires and fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had entered our pit-stop window and we knew we had to do
three pit stops,'' Sharp said. ``Sometimes if you do it early, you
can get ahead of the curve. That was David's (team manager David
Cripps) call. His strategy won one for us at Phoenix and I'm not
going to question that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp was back to second behind Stewart with another restart on
Lap 110. And for much of the rest of the race, he and Goodyear
chased Stewart.

FIRST LADY VISITS CENTER FOR WOMEN AND THE LAW
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright traveled to the outskirts of Beijing on
Monday morning to visit a women's legal aid center that operates on
the leading edge of China's developing legal system, tackling a
wide range of issues affecting women _ from rape to job
discrimination to family planning.
</P>
<P>
   Guo Jianmei, the center's executive director, told the American
visitors that the center takes on cases ``representative of social
issues women are facing,'' adding, ``We are confident our work will
promote women's rights and the progress of Chinese society.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, herself a lawyer, praised the center's work as
``ground-breaking.'' Ms. Albright said the center had ``earned a
place in Chinese legal history'' for its ``innovative and
courageous work.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-year-old center, affiliated with the Beijing University
law school, is in many ways an anomaly: an aggressive legal aid
center in a country whose emerging justice system remains riddled
with flaws; an organization run by outspoken women in a country
where discrimination against women is rampant, and a
nongovernmental organization in a country where the government
ultimately calls the shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're doing some really difficult work against tremendous
odds, since the legal system is still quite weak and they're
representing people who have neither power nor money,'' said
Phyllis Chang, a legal expert with the Ford Foundation in Beijing,
which finances the center. ``Given that, I think they've been
surprisingly effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The center's very existence is evidence of the progress achieved
by China's decade-old effort to update its legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The government is showing increasing interest in legal aid, and
legal aid centers for the poor have sprung up around China in the
last two years, generally under the Justice Ministry. The country
has 180 mostly tiny centers, with about half set up in the last six
months.
</P>
<P>
   American assistance for the legal aid system is among the
initiatives announced on President Clinton's state visit. So it was
not surprising that the first lady, Ms. Albright and the
president's special adviser on the White House Rule of Law
Initiative, Paul Gewirtz, came here to learn what such centers can
accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States wants to work with Chinese citizens and its
government as you strive to strengthen your legal system,'' Ms.
Albright told the center's staff.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guo explained that the center's goal was to use the law to
improve the lot of women in China. But it also seeks to promote the
development of the emerging legal system, publicizing and trying to
resolve its many flaws and contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese legislators have drafted a number of laws
during the last decade aimed at protecting personal rights, many
are vague or are ignored by often poorly trained judges. The
courts, paid by local governments, tend to favor authority. And
judgments are hard to enforce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our 1992 law of the protection of women's rights is quite
comprehensive, but it is not always carried out,'' Ms. Guo said in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A sampling of the center's cases:
</P>
<P>
   _It helped prosecute a high school principal in Chengde who
raped a 16-year-old who died in childbirth. The principal was found
guilty of a lesser charge of hooliganism and put on probation. The
center said the judge never received all the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   _The center brought a class-action suit against a factory in
Beijing on behalf of 20 workers, rural migrants who had not been
paid in months.
</P>
<P>
   _The center has been representing female engineers whose
employer forced them to retire earlier than their male colleagues,
even though such discrimination is prohibited. Although a judge has
found in the women's favor, the company has refused to give them
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently the center has taken up the case of a former
banquet organizer at a state-owned hotel who sued her employer over
a huge fine that the hotel had imposed when she and her husband had
their first child, without the company's approval. Urban employers
are charged with enforcing the national family planning policies.
The plaintiffs argued that the penalties imposed by the hotel were
excessive.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where most citizens still go to great lengths to
avoid controversy, Ms. Guo does not mind jumping into the fray. She
said the center's staff of young lawyers, law students and
volunteers have won more than half the cases that they have taken
on. However, they find they must often appeal to senior officials
or resort to public pressure through the press to enforce the court
decisions.

   NEW YORK _ Orlando Hernandez was about two hours away from his
first pitch, which is a time when most major league starters have
an imaginary wall around them. It is usually anathema to starters
to be interviewed before they pitch, but Hernandez ignored that
policy on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yankees' first-base coach, Jose Cardenal, as an
interpreter, an animated Hernandez talked about everything from the
likelihood that Cuban President Fidel Castro would watch Sunday
night's series finale between the Mets and the Yankees to how
Hernandez's grandfather was such a weak baseball player that he was
only used as a pinch-runner.
</P>
<P>
   If Hernandez is superstitious, he might assemble the same 10
reporters for another chat before his next start. Although the
Yankees eventually lost, 2-1, Hernandez followed his pre-game
session by silencing the Mets without a hit into the sixth inning.
He kept throwing, and dominating, while uncorking an astounding 142
pitches, the most thrown by a Yankee this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to pitch the same way that I've been pitching,''
Hernandez said in the visiting clubhouse at Shea Stadium before the
game. ``I want to do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked. He had a stunning bout with wildness, in
which he walked four of the first seven Mets, but was saved when
catcher Jorge Posada gunned down runners at second and third on
attempted steals. Hernandez went on to retire 12 of 13 batters at
one point.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped the Mets on one run and two singles over eight
innings, striking out nine, walking five and throwing one damaging
wild pitch in his fifth major league start, and was out of the game
when the Mets won on Luis Lopez's sacrifice fly in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pulli, the plate umpire, may have unnerved Hernandez in
the first inning by telling him he was finished with his warmup
tosses before he thought he was. Yankee Manager Joe Torre met with
Pulli before the second, and the umpire used hand signals to tell
Hernandez the number of warmup pitches he had left in subsequent
innings. Hernandez walked just one batter after the second. In the
one inning the Mets scored against him, though, Hernandez was too
tricky for Posada.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the sixth and Hernandez still working on a
no-hitter, he threw a nasty 3-2 breaking ball that Mike Piazza
waved at for strike three. But Posada also waved at the ball, and
it rolled by him for a wild pitch, allowing Piazza to hustle to
first. Giving the Mets a fourth out was an ominous sign during a
no-hit attempt.
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud followed by also working Hernandez to a 3-2 count.
Finally, Olerud looped a shot to right that landed inches in front
of a charging Paul O'Neill for the Mets' first hit. O'Neill
short-hopped the ball, but no one was fooled. The no-hitter was
gone.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the shutout was history, too, as Carlos Baerga also worked
Hernandez deep in the count before smacking a single over the mound
for a 1-0 lead. Hernandez struck out Butch Huskey to strand men on
first and third and whiffed Edgardo Alfonzo with McRae on second to
end the seventh. He had thrown 134 pitches through seven innings,
and it was somewhat surprising when he came back out for the
eighth. All Hernandez did was pump eight pitches for a 1-2-3
inning. Ramiro Mendoza replaced him in the ninth with the score
tied, 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez compared the Mets-Yankees rivalry, with its fervor, to
the one in Cuba between Industriales, his former team, and Metro,
the team Rey Ordonez played for. He and Masato Yoshii, who gave up
just two hits himself in seven innings for the Mets, contributed to
a rowdy atmosphere on Sunday night. Before the game, Hernandez did
cite one big difference in the conduct of Cuban spectators.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a lot of fights in the stands,'' he said. ``In
Cuba, if you fight, you go to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Hernandez smiled, which he did often during the 15-minute
exchange with reporters. The pitcher defected from Cuba on Dec. 26,
1997, with seven others on a 17-foot raft, and signed a four-year,
$6.6million contract with the Yankees in March. He has not stopped
smiling since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Castro will be watching this game,'' Hernandez said of the
ruler who banned him from the Cuban national team in October 1996
because he thought the pitcher would follow his brother Livan and
defect. ``He knows everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Castro should know that Hernandez was outstanding on Sunday
night. Before the game, he charmed reporters and bopped to Bruce
Springsteen's ``Glory Days.'' He was probably unaware that the song
is about a former high school pitcher who cannot stop reminiscing
about his high school days and the terrific fastball he once had.
Hernandez, though, has made it to the United States and will not
have to rely on his glory days in Cuba for memories. He will have
nights like Sunday night to create more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to win,'' Hernandez said when asked about
opposing the Mets before more than 53,000 fans and a national
television audience. ``The other stuff, I don't care about.''

PGA Tour's older players coming back strong in 1998
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JAYNE CUSTRED
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   It was the young guns' game in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four major championships were won by golfers who
were 20-something, and the new blood on the PGA Tour continued to
dominate week in and week out for much of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Now consider the scene for the first half of 1998. Mark O'Meara,
41, triumphed at the Masters. Fred Couples, 38, came through with
two wins and three other top-three finishes. And Tom Watson, 48,
reconsidered his plans to head to the Senior circuit after besting
a stellar field at the Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the young players continue to turn in their stunning
performances. No one has been more consistent than David Duval, 26.
Tiger Woods is not having the same season he had last year, but he
has spent a good portion of his time at the top of the leader
board.
</P>
<P>
   But at the midway point in the 1998 PGA Tour season, the
``veteran'' golfers have proved they should not be taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember four or five years ago when the European players
won all the majors,'' Tom Lehman said. ``The media were writing off
the U.S. players, saying there were no good U.S. players. Then, of
course, the U.S. players have won almost every major since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, some of these younger guys started stepping up, and
now it is the young guys that are in control of the tour. That
happens for a season, and then Tom Watson wins and Couples wins a
couple of times, and suddenly, it is the old guys again.
</P>
<P>
   ``So things kind of go in cycles. And great players are great
players period, no matter how old they are. The old guys never went
anywhere. It is just that the younger guys played a little better
last year.''
</P>
<P>
   But this year there has been a rebirth for some. Couples, who
hadn't won since the 1996 Players Championship, got on the board
early, winning the second event of the year, the Bob Hope Chrysler
Classic. He won again at the Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Scott Simpson, 42, picked up his first victory in
five years, winning the Buick Invitational. Then came O'Meara's
green jacket at Augusta National. With most of the attention on
Couples and Duval, O'Meara sank a curling 20-footer for birdie on
the 72nd hole to steal the Masters title.
</P>
<P>
   Six events later, it would be Watson's turn.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, like most of the seasoned golfers on tour, wasn't
surprised by the change in fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many good players now in the world, and a lot of
them happen to be young,'' O'Meara said. ``They have burst onto the
scene with high expectations, and they have lived up to those
expectations. There is just so much talent that it is very
interesting to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fact is, I have actually played some of my best golf
over the last three, four years. I am now 41 years old. Tom Watson
has been playing some extremely good golf. Obviously, his putting
touch has returned because we saw that at Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it's nice to have a good mix. And I have said
this before: The golf ball is sitting out there on the ground. It
really doesn't know how old you are. It doesn't know if you are 20
or 30 or 50 or 60 or 70. It just kind of sits there waiting to be
struck. That is what makes this game so special.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the young golfers must be given their due. If asked
who is the most dominant player of the moment, most would point to
Duval. He won the Tucson Chrysler Classic and the Shell Houston
Open, and has contended nearly every week. Duval has missed just
one cut and finished in the top 15 seven times, most recently at
the U.S. Open, where he was tied for seventh on the treacherous
Olympic Club course.
</P>
<P>
   That's a far cry from when Duval first joined the tour and
seemed unable to win. In his first three seasons on tour, he was in
the top 10 18 times before winning his last three events in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt that I could succeed out here,'' Duval said.
``Now, I think it is a big jump and a big assumption to expect to
win that many golf tournaments that quickly and in that short of a
span of time. But it just happened to work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as you do it and the more you do it, the more
confidence you get because you realize that there are many
different ways to win. So then comes Sunday when you have a chance,
and you might not be quite doing or playing the way you had
envisioned, but you realize that there is more than one way to go
about it, and there is more than one way to finish.''
</P>
<P>
   Other younger golfers joining Duval in the winner's circle this
season are also household names. Defending British Open champion
Justin Leonard captured a big victory at The Players Championship.
Phil Mickelson began the year by winning the Mercedes
Championships, and Ernie Els was in the winner's circle at the Bay
Hill Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Woods. Last year, he was the dominant golfer. He
started with a win at the Mercedes Championships in 1997, followed
it up with an unbelievable performance at the Masters, then added
two victories down the stretch. He was the 1997 Player of the Year
and the leading money winner.
</P>
<P>
   Tigermania has not calmed, but Woods doesn't seem to have the
same flash as he did a year ago. He got his first win of the season
in May at the BellSouth Classic. But his all-out assault on the PGA
Tour appears to have hit a few snags.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Meara, for one, believes it is only a matter of time
before Woods dominates again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiger is really hitting the ball well,'' said O'Meara, perhaps
Woods closest friend on tour. ``He is swinging as good as I have
seen him swing. And if Tiger is not the best, he is right there.''
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps now is the time for the golfers in their 30s to make
their noise. Lee Janzen, 33, hadn't won since he captured three
tournaments in 1995. With the new players on the scene and the
veterans making a splash, Janzen was all but forgotten. He proved
at the U.S. Open that he is anything but gone.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen's even-par effort at the Olympic Club was superb. He
refused to let the pressure of the event, or of the course, get to
him. And he gave a demonstration in patience that was inspiring.
That's why it was Janzen who cradled the U.S. Open trophy, tears in
his eyes, when the second major of the season came to a close.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, heading into the British Open, it's anybody's guess
who will have an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't look at anybody as a young guy or an old guy,''
Leonard said. ``Golf isn't really a sport where age makes a huge
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it depends on the individual. I mean, sure, the
difference between a 15-year-old and a 30-year-old is a big
difference. But once you are a professional on the PGA Tour, I
don't think age is as great a factor as people make it out to be.
The way the tour is these days, anyone can win.''

DODGERS TAKE ONE ON CHIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gary Sheffield was winning the game by himself
Sunday night when he went for the knockout punch. He had no idea it
was going to cost the Dodgers a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield already had a home run and RBI single when he touched
off a bench-clearing brawl after colliding with Pittsburgh catcher
Jason Kendall at home plate in the sixth inning of the Pirates' 6-4
victory.
</P>
<P>
   In front of 38,865 at Dodger Stadium, Sheffield and Kendall went
at it and both benches emptied. It was nothing like the vicious
Yankees-Orioles fight last month, but it certainly stirred the
Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of getting swept in the three-game series, they erased a
three-run deficit with five runs in the final three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of heading on the road with some much-needed momentum,
the Dodgers fell apart, committing two critical errors when
Pittsburgh took over the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did it change the momentum of the game?'' manager Glenn
Hoffman said. ``I once saw (Detroit pitcher) Dave Rozema try to do
a karate kick in a fight like that and he blew out his knee. He was
never the same. Geez, I wanted this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield, probably the Dodgers' only All-Star representative
next month in Denver, left for UCLA Medical Center after he and
Kendall were ejected. Sheffield received a cut on his left eyelid
during the pileup but did not require stitches.
</P>
<P>
   He will be re-examined today before the club leaves for a
six-game trip that begins Tuesday in Texas; he is not expected to
miss any playing time.
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Dodgers appeared to be settling down after a
tumultuous week, they are back in a bad light. There is a good
chance center fielder Raul Mondesi will face disciplinary action
from the National League for punching Kendall when the catcher was
on the ground during the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers (39-42) also blew a chance to pick up a game on San
Diego, which leads them by a whopping 13{ games in the NL West at
the season's 81-game midpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Dodgers head on a road trip that includes a weekend
series in San Francisco. The second-place Giants are eight games
ahead of the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great chance to make up a little ground and
continue playing well,'' said Dodgers starter Dave Mlicki.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed a two-run homer to Al Martin after racing into the
middle of the fight, but he said, ``I don't think that changed
anything. I know I made some bad pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield took over the game from the outset, hitting a two-run
homer off right-hander Jason Schmidt in the first inning and adding
an RBI single in the fourth that gave the Dodgers a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The home run was Sheffield's seventh since joining the Dodgers
after the May 15 Mike Piazza trade; it was his 13th overall. In 38
games with the Dodgers, Sheffield is batting .340 (42 for 125). In
the absence of ailing Bobby Bonilla, he has been the Dodgers' most
consistent offensive player. Mondesi has 17 homers and Eric Karros
has an 11-game hitting streak, but no one has been more consistent
than Sheffield.
</P>
<P>
   Until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi singled to open the sixth and Sheffield followed with a
walk. Karros, who was dropped from the cleanup spot despite his hot
bat, flied to deep center, but rookie Paul Konerko singled to
center, scoring Mondesi and giving the Dodgers a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After reliever Mike Williams (1-0) replaced Schmidt, Roger
Cedeno came in to run for Konerko. Cedeno attempted to steal second
and got caught in a rundown. As Young ran Cedeno to second,
Sheffield took off for the plate.
</P>
<P>
   He went in standing up but and was out easily. But, attempting
to avoid the tag, Sheffield hooked his left arm on Kendall's
equipment. Then they started yelling at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Kendall) didn't like what he said and he didn't like what
Kendall said and it escalated from there,'' umpire Jerry Crawford
said. ``Have I seen plays like that turn a game around? Oh, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   To that point, Mlicki, the surprise of the Dodgers staff, hadn't
allowed an earned run in 281/3 innings. He had given up an unearned
run in the second after an error by second baseman Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   But in the seventh he allowed the home run to Martin on the
first pitch, cutting the lead to 4-3. Scott Radinsky (2-4) came in
to start the eighth and allowed a single and a walk before giving
way to Greg McMichael.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's replacement, Keith Osik, lined a sharp single back at
McMichael to load the bases. The game was tied on a fielder's
choice by Young, and the go-ahead run scored when rookie third
baseman Adrian Beltre threw away Jose Guillen's potential
inning-ending ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much the fight had to do with everything, I don't know,''
Kendall said. ``All I know is we haven't been scoring runs. Tonight
we got a spark.'' &QL;

AS MERCURY WINS, MILLER SEES FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``It's only two points!'' someone in the crowd of
15,191 at the MCI Center yelled at Cheryl Miller on Sunday as she
leaped off the bench to celebrate a brilliant coast-to-coast play
by 6-foot-8 Maria Stepanova.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, two ``big'' points,'' the Mercury coach shot back, and
not just because it capped a 14-3 run that put away the Washington
Mystics in an 86-69 victory.
</P>
<P>
   What Stepanova did _ block former American Basketball League
Most Valuable Player Nikki McCray, then race downcourt to convert a
layup _ was huge because of the long-term implications. If the
Russian, a 19-year-old just off the injured list with only seven
minutes of prior playing time, can play like that now, how much
more is possible in the years to come?
</P>
<P>
   Miller turned to Stepanova with 9:46 remaining and the Mercury
(6-1) unable to finish off the expansion Mystics (1-6), much like a
game in Phoenix on June 15.
</P>
<P>
   The Mystics got two points closer, 60-52, before Stepanova
triggered the killer run with 11 points, six rebounds, two blocks
and an assist in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That after learning in the morning she would play for the first
time in almost two weeks, swapping places with Brandy Reed
(patellar tendinitis, right knee) on the 11-player active list.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice seeing Stepanova come in and play well,'' Miller
said of her first-round draft pick. ``The crowd was kind of getting
on me a little bit because she blocked a shot and scored two
points, I'm like, `Yeah, but she's 19 years old.' There is this
huge future for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was neat to see her respond to being thrown into that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller speaks limited Russian and supplements her vocabulary
with the help of interpreter Yelena Badalyants, telling Stepanova
to run, be aggressive and take it to the hoop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very helpful to have your coach not only to tell you
when you're doing something bad, but when you're doing something
good as well, and that's what Cheryl does,'' Stepanova said through
the interpreter. ``It is very helpful for morale and makes you want
to go out and play more and prove to your coach that you can do it
and to not let her down.
</P>
<P>
   ``She communicates with her team, I have learned, not just as a
coach but as a good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller could well throw Stepanova into the WNBA's highest
profile arena, Madison Square Garden, on national television
against the New York Liberty at 4:30 p.m. today. The back-to-back
games are the second of the season for the Mercury, which swept Los
Angeles and Washington at home on the first occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even (if) she has (only) a minute to play on the court, she'll
set out to prove herself,'' the interpreter said of Stepanova's
comments. ``The more time she has, the more excited she gets.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as Stepanova was in the second half, 6-5 Marlies Askamp
was equally effective in the first, recording 12 points and four
rebounds in 10 minutes. It was the biggest contribution of the
season for Askamp, the first player off the bench last year, who in
the middle of April was on crutches and relegated to aqua jogging
for five weeks because of a torn foot tendon.
</P>
<P>
   Askamp's steal from LaShawn Brown and layup started the Mercury
on a 13-2 run for a 28-18 lead that grew to 36-22 before the
Mystics got within 38-25 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important for me to make my first layup, I didn't do
that last game,'' Askamp said. ``Then, that's my game, get the
offensive board and run the floor. That's my type of game.''
</P>
<P>
   While Askamp and Stepanova picked up the slack for Jennifer
Gillom, held to a season-low eight points, Bridget Pettis remained
on fire from the perimeter. She had a team-high 23 points, her
third 20-point game in the past four. It was her eye-popping moves
_ not McCray's _ that drew the ooohs, especially a behind-the-back
drive that was so good no one cared that the layup rimmed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching Mike too long,'' said Pettis, the East
Chicago, Ind., native of her Bulls idol. ``That was shaking and
baking.''
</P>
<P>
   Pettis' backcourt mate, Michele Timms, had a pair of
three-pointers and 10 points on her 33rd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Murriel Page (18 points), McCray (15) and Penny Moore (15)
reached double figures for the Mystics, who take a three-game
losing streak to Houston today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to step it up,'' said McCray, held below her 21.5
average. ``It's a trying time for our team. None of us are used to
losing.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix and defending league champion Houston are tied for first
in the Western Conference. Eastern Conference Charlotte (7-1) is a
half-game ahead for the league's best record. Conference champions
and the two teams with the next best records regardless of
conference qualify for the playoffs. &QL;

THE POWER PLAY  
 BENITEZ'S HR LIFTS D-BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - One pitch. One swing. One run. One victory.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that, the Diamondbacks defeated the Seattle Mariners,
3-2, on Sunday at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Yamil Benitez wasted little time in deciding the
outcome. His solo home run into the picnic area in left-center
field on the first pitch of the ninth inning from Mariners
right-hander Bobby Ayala sent the Diamondbacks onto the road for a
six-game trip to Chicago and Houston on a positive note.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona took two of the three games in the weekend series,
finishing interleague play with a 5-8 record. Arizona's overall
record is 28-54. Seattle (34-48) goes home to face the Colorado
Rockies in a three-game interleague series.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second home run in as many games for Benitez, who has
played primarily against left-handers and has been used as a pinch
hitter the rest of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew when I hit it, it was gone,'' Benitez said of his sixth
homer of the season. ``That's the first home run I've hit to win a
game since . . . well, I can't remember. It's been a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter knows Benitez's potential,
but rookie David Dellucci has been playing very well, and that has
limited Benitez's playing time. Dellucci started in center field
Sunday in place of Devon White, who was given the day off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good for Yammy,'' Showalter said. ``He answered the
bell and has done what it takes to be ready to play this season.
He's worked hard at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez acknowledged that he wants to play every day, ``but I
don't make those decisions. What I'm trying to do is stay focused
and patient, be ready for every chance I get.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks jumped to a 1-0 lead in the first inning.
Leadoff batter Andy Fox singled off left-hander Jamie Moyer _ it
was the seventh straight plate appearance in which he reached base
_ and scored on Matt Williams' one-out single to left field.
Williams increased his hitting streak to 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks left-hander Brian Anderson nursed the lead until
two outs in the sixth, when Ken Griffey Jr. ripped his 32nd homer
into the stands in right. It was the 21st homer allowed by Anderson
this season, tying Cleveland's Charles Nagy for the major league
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona quickly regained the lead in its half of the sixth.
Williams led off with a single and was forced on a grounder by
Dellucci. After a groundout by Benitez for the second out, right
fielder Karim Garcia hit a triple off the yellow line on top of the
right-field fence to score Dellucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping it would be a home run, but I'll still take my
triple and RBI,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson pitched to one batter in the eighth, giving up a single
to leadoff batter Dan Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson gave way to another left-hander, former Cleveland
Indians teammate Alan Embree, acquired last week in a trade with
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter David Segui hit a grounder to shortstop Jay Bell,
who bobbled the ball. Segui was ruled safe at second as the result
of an error, and Segui reached first on the fielder's choice.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cora moved both runners up with a sacrifice, and Alex
Rodriguez's grounder to short allowed pinch runner Rich Amaral to
score the tying run.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was disappointed that he couldn't hold the lead,
Anderson said, ``Of course, you'd like to have the `W' put next to
your own name, but the bottom line is, our team won. My first goal
is to keep us in the game and give us a chance to win, and I did
that.''
</P>
<P>
   In seven innings, Anderson gave up five hits and two runs, one
earned, walked one and struck out one.
</P>
<P>
   In the eighth, it was decision time for Mariners Manager Lou
Piniella. Should he leave Moyer in? He was pitching well. Or should
he go to his volatile bullpen? At the Kingdome, the fans begin to
boo when the bullpen phone rings, or they tack up banners that say,
``Refuse to Use.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella went with Ayala, who retired Travis Lee, Williams and
Dellucci in order. Then came the quick encounter in the ninth with
Benitez, who gave Embree his second victory.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing Benitez was wearing his batting helmet,
because he was mobbed by his teammates and slapped on the head
after crossing the plate. &QL;

COYOTES CHASE PREDATORS IN DEAL FOR CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB McManaman  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Coyotes hope to complete a trade with the
expansion Nashville Predators today that will bring them one of two
centers, either Craig Darby or veteran Mike Sullivan, in exchange
for a late-round pick in next year's draft, according to NHL
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Nashville acquired Darby from the Philadelphia Flyers and
Sullivan from the Boston Bruins in the NHL expansion draft Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, the 6-foot-3, 200-pound Darby appears to have the
most up-side and attraction. A four-year pro from Oneida, N.Y.,
he's played only 35 regular-season games in the NHL but pumped in a
team-high 42 goals and 87 points last season for the Flyers' minor
league affiliate in the American Hockey League, the Philadelphia
Phantoms.
</P>
<P>
   Darby, 25, also has scored at least 20 goals each of the
previous two years in the AHL. He had one goal in three games with
the Flyers in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-2, 190-pound Sullivan, meanwhile, is a decent two-way
player who can create some offense and help shut down opposing
lines defensively. The seven-year pro from Marshfield, Mass.,
scored five goals and added 13 assists in 77 games last season for
Boston. He has played 453 career NHL games.
</P>
<P>
   One of them will be brought in primarily for depth, specifically
on either the third or fourth lines. The Coyotes risk losing two of
their centers in those roles, Bob Corkum and Mark Janssens, to free
agency. Sullivan, 30, also has played left wing, where he could
challenge Darrin Shannon's spot on the third line. Shannon also
becomes a free agent on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bobby Smith had been trying to finalize the deal
for the past few days. Initially, it hinged on the Coyotes picking
a prospect in Saturday's NHL draft and then shipping his rights to
Nashville. That plan fell through, however, and Smith later
confirmed Phoenix now will trade one of next year's picks to the
Predators. ``Hopefully, he'll play on our team next year, and it'll
be for a draft pick in '99,'' Smith said, declining to identify the
player. &QL; 
Note
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld underwent emergency surgery last
week to repair torn tendons in his left arm and hand after it was
sliced during a freak accident on the skating rink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing a game of (three-on-three) shinny with some of
our coaches and some other guys a couple of weeks ago, and there
was a crash in the corners and someone's blades ran through me,''
said Schoenfeld, who is wearing a cast up this elbow.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of blood, but that didn't seem to bother the
former rough-and-tumble NHL defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things will happen when older guys still try to play a
young man's game,'' the 46-year-old Schoenfeld said, laughing. &QL;

IT'S MAGIC: POUNDS MELT IN VEGAS ACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Las Vegas is known for impersonators, but that was no Elvis on
the scale a couple of weeks ago before a bout with Phoenix
middleweight
 &UR; Fidel Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   In another chapter of boxing burlesque (won't these follies ever
end?), Hernandez lost to a Philadelphia's  &UR; Aaron Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   We think.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the fighter could have been  &UR; Eric Mitchell, Aaron's
twin.
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate Hernandez can't really be certain. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   At a weigh-in the night before the June 19 fight at The Orleans,
Hernandez and Mitchell, presumably Aaron, were supposed to be at no
more than 158 pounds each.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was a couple of pounds below the agreed-upon weight.
But Mitchell was 162{ pounds. Mitchell was given 12 hours to lose
the excess. Another weigh-in was scheduled for 7 a.m. the next day.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, a Mitchell stepped on the scales.  &UR; Jenny Craig
would have been proud. This Mitchell weighed 156{.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird, because I saw his trainer bring food to his room
the night before,'' said Hernandez, a tough-minded young prospect
from
 &UR; Michael Carbajal's Ninth Street Gym. ``I thought, `He's got to lose
weight, and he's eating?' I figured he'd be out jogging or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   After this Mitchell stepped off the scale, he was asked to sign
a standard contract. He didn't. Instead, he ran out the room before
promoter  &UR; Robert Gonzalez could offer him a pen.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to identify a problem. Gonzalez suspected
that the slimmed-down Mitchell was in fact Eric.
</P>
<P>
   Eric, a good welterweight, fights at 147. Aaron, a good super
middleweight, is comfortable at 168. But, hey, they look like each
other, so what's a few pounds between twins?
</P>
<P>
   For Hernandez, plenty.
</P>
<P>
   After the apparent bait-and-switch, Hernandez was told the fight
was off. He spent the next several hours at buffet tables, the pool
and casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``I even went bowling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez had gone from warrior on the eve of battle to Las
Vegas tourist within a few hours. That evening, he walked to the
ballroom, site of the night's card. Suddenly, he was told the bout
was back on at 165 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   This time, there was no doubt about Mitchell's identity. It was
Aaron, super middleweight, against Hernandez, junior middleweight.
Hernandez was knocked out in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally, I wasn't ready,'' said Hernandez, whose star-crossed
career includes a nasty managerial battle and a victory over a
fighter who was in the ring for the second time in as many nights.
``All day, I was thinking I wouldn't fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe I was cheated. They did something that wasn't right,
that was wrong from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez co-managers  &UR; Joe Joseph and  &UR; Danny Carbajal are
planning to file a protest with the Nevada State Athletic
Commission, which already is facing double trouble after July 9
when  &UR; Mike Tyson is eligible to reapply for the license he lost
last year for dining on
 &UR; Evander Holyfield's ears. Both of them. &QL; 
 &QL; 
On the road again &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Oscar De La Hoya and  &UR; Julio  &UR; Cesar Chavez are scheduled to
arrive at the Valley's Celebrity Theater on July 16 in the second
stop on a tour to sell their Sept. 18 rematch at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The assumption is that Chavez will be available. He was arrested
in Mexico on tax charges two days after he was badly bloodied last
week in a victory over  &UR; Ken Sigurani. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Briefly. . .  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Valley card is scheduled for July 14 at Midnight Rodeo.
Phoenix bantamweight  &UR; Homero Sierra, national Golden Gloves
runner-up, will make his pro debut.
</P>
<P>
   And guard  &UR; Roy Jones  &UR; Jr. is shooting only 29 percent from the
floor for Jacksonville of the United States Basketball League.
Defenders fear him, anyway. &QL;

KNEE CYST KNOCKS STANKIEWICZ TO DL  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - While right-hander  &UR; Aaron Small joined the club
Saturday after being picked up on waivers from the Oakland
Athletics, veteran infielder
 &UR; Andy Stankiewicz was placed on the 15-day disabled list,
retroactive to Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stankiewicz had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee during
spring training, and a magnetic resonance imaging taken recently
revealed that a cyst has grown on the inside of the area where the
surgery was performed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; David Zeman, the team's orthopedic surgeon, was due to give
Stankiewicz an injection to help break up the cyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in Cincinnati recently, I noticed Andy didn't
quite have the quick first step he usually has, and he admitted the
knee had been bothering him,'' Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Stankiewicz is hitting .196 with no homers and seven RBIs, and
he has played sparingly of late at second base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating,'' Stankiewicz said. ``I was hoping I could
play through it, but it just didn't get any better. Hopefully, the
injection will take care of it and I can get back after the
All-Star break.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Devo takes a breather &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder  &UR; Devon White, who had started all but four of the
Diamondbacks games, was given the day off Sunday to rest his sore
legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been wanting to give him some time for the last three
games, and today seemed like a good day because we also have
another day Monday (today's exhibition game in South Bend, Ind.),''
Showalter said. &QL; 
 &QL; 
On to South Bend &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The team's game against the Class A South Bend affiliate will
begin at 4 p.m. today, Arizona time, at Koveleski Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud and excited to go,'' Showalter said. ``It's a
quality minor league facility, and it means a lot to the fans and
that community.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jorge Fabregas, on the disabled list because of a sore right
ankle, will catch for Arizona tonight, then a determination will be
made as to whether to activate him for the big club. Fabregas
caught most of the game for Triple-A Tucson on Saturday night. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Sellout string &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's crowd of 47,968 was the 16th sellout at Bank One
Ballpark and marked the third series sellout of the season. The
other two were against the Los Angeles Dodgers and the St. Louis
Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The season attendance total to date is 1,684,332 for 37 dates,
putting the team on a pace for 3.6 million to 3.8 million for the
season. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Average plunges to .650 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Going into the game, Seattle's  &UR; Edgar Martinez was 13 for 17
with three homers during his career against  &UR; Brian Anderson. Before
the series started Friday, Showalter told Anderson, ``I've seen a
lot of match-ups, but I've never seen a hitter own somebody like he
owns you.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Martinez is just renting now. He went went 0 for 3 against
Anderson before hitting a single off  &UR; Alan Embree in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a tough hitter,'' Anderson said. ``I feel my stuff's
improved since the last time I faced him. I figure, just attack
him. Don't avoid him.'' &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton proclaimed personal freedom the
``mandate of the new century'' in a broad defense of human and
economic liberty on Monday in a speech at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   In his last public appearance in the Chinese capital, the
president said the United States did not seek to impose its vision
of society on China or any other nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we are convinced that certain rights are universal,'' the
president said, ``not American rights or European rights or rights
for developed nations, but the birthrights of people everywhere,
now enshrined in the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights _
the right to be treat with dignity, the right to express one's
opinion, to choose one's own leaders, to associate freely with
others and to worship, or not, freely, however one chooses.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials called Monday's speech, which was
carried live on Chinese television, a philosophical discourse
addressed directly to the Chinese people, after a weekend that
featured a remarkable series of public and private discussions with
President Jiang Zemin, and a visit to Beijing's largest Protestant
church.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to several hundred students and faculty members in a
freshly painted auditorium at China's most prestigious university,
Clinton sought to broaden his audience from the Chinese leadership
to a new generation that will shape the future of the most populous
country on earth. Beijing University, which is celebrating its
centennial this year, has been the nurturing ground of successive
movements for political change in China.
</P>
<P>
   He said liberty was not a luxury to be enjoyed only by wealthy
nations, but a necessary element of human and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging China's centuries-old fear of internal
disintegration, he said all societies craved stability.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, personal freedom strengthens a nation's security,
rather than undermining it, as the Communist government has
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, and our experience demonstrates, that freedom
strengthens stability and helps nations to change,'' Clinton said.
``China's greatest source of strength resides in the minds and
hearts of its citizens. It is therefore profoundly in your
interest, and the world's, that young Chinese minds be free to
reach the fullness of their potential. This is the message of our
time and the mandate of the new century and the new millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   He hailed the rapid economic growth that has swept across China
in the last decade, as the government has loosened controls on
private entrepreneurship and begun to close down inefficient
state-owned enterprises. He said growing incomes brought more
options to the Chinese people: foreign travel, access to cable
television and the Internet, new career opportunities, a higher
standard of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``But true freedom includes more than economic freedom,'' the
president said. ``In America, we believe it is a concept which is
indivisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke for 30 minutes, then took questions for another
half hour.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the United States sought to isolate China through
security agreements with Japan and arms sales to Taiwan, he
answered: ``It is not fair to say that either Japan or the United
States have a security relationship that is designed to contain
China,'' and added that American policy posed no obstacle to the
peaceful reunification of China and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Another student followed up with one of many surprisingly
challenging questions, this one about whether the president,
despite his smile, intended to pursue a policy of containment of
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is no,'' Clinton said. ``I'm not hiding another
design behind the smile. That's what I really believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Another questioner asked whether there remained problems in the
United States in realizing it ideals of democracy and human
liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton replied that the United States is still plagued by
violent crime and racial and sex discrimination. ``So we Americans
need to be sensitive not only to preserve the freedoms that we hold
dear, but also to create an environment in which people can build a
truly good and free life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared somewhat taken aback by the students'
suspicions about American motives in engaging the Chinese
leadership in discussions while continuing to support Taiwan and
maintaining a strong strategic alliance with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   The Beijing University speech offered a coda to a series of
weekend meetings with Jiang and other top government leaders here.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday evening, Clinton and Jiang continued their dialogue at
a private dinner, exploring in greater depth the growth of the
United States-China relationship and possible paths of China's
future.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner was the last meeting of the two presidents on
Clinton's nine-day, five-city visit to China, which has seen a
significant step forward in relations both between the two nations
and between their leaders. Aides called the evening ``very casual
and very lively.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday began with a service at Chongwenmen Church and ended with
the dinner, attended by the presidents' wives and a few top
advisers. The day also included an afternoon of touristic
diversions to the Forbidden City and the Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, in the Zhongnanhai compound for Beijing's political
elite, included discussion of the Asian financial crisis,
development of an independent judiciary in China and American
movies. Jiang recalled enjoying ``Gone with the Wind'' several
years ago in Shanghai, according to an American official who
attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went way beyond what people thought were the
possibilities of having this kind of discussion,'' Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright said of the two days of meetings between
the two presidents. ``We have moved the relationship into a
qualitatively and quantitatively different direction.''

 BEIJING: different direction.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Albright and other American officials were still clearly elated
by the news conference on Saturday in which Clinton and Jiang
engaged in an animated debate on topics that for years were not the
subject of public discussion _ religious freedom, Tibet and the
role of the individual and the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press conference was a truly remarkable event and one that
is going to have long-term repercussions _ positive ones,''
Albright said in a session with reporters at the Diaoyutai state
guest compound here. But in a reminder that not everything has
changed in China, American security officials had posted a notice
on the wall of the room where Albright spoke, reading, ``The walls
have ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright and two other American officials _ Sandy Berger, the
national security adviser, and James Sasser, the ambassador to
China _ said on Sunday that 600 million Chinese had seen the news
conference, carried live on China Central Television, the state
network.
</P>
<P>
   That number seemed a significant exaggeration, given that there
are an estimated 300 million television sets in China and there was
no advance notice that the news conference would be carried live.
It was difficult to find Chinese who had seen the live broadcast,
and state television rebroadcast only selected portions.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Sunday, the president and his wife, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, attended services at Chongwenmen Church, the largest
officially sanctioned Protestant church in Beijing, with more than
2,000 members. The congregation gave Clinton a bilingual Bible and
asked him to speak to the overflow crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``We celebrate with you the growth of the practice of our faith
in China,'' Clinton said in remarks that lasted less than five
minutes. ``I believe our faith calls upon us to seek unity with
people across the world with different backgrounds and races and
creeds.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I believe Chinese and Americans are brothers and
sisters as children of God. We come here in that spirit today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and their daughter, Chelsea, spent Sunday afternoon
touring the Forbidden City and the section of the Great Wall at
Mutianyu. The authorities cleared the Forbidden City complex for
the Clintons, only the third time they have done so, American
officials said. The previous times were for a tour by President
Richard Nixon and for the making of the film ``The Last Emperor.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the wall ``quite unbelievable.''

D-BACKS DUO DOMINATE MARINERS  
 REUNITED MATES SHINE ON MOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The (comedy?) team of Brian Anderson and Alan Embree has been
reunited. Look for more yuks in the clubhouse. Practically
speaking, the Diamondbacks would prefer more of what transpired
Sunday, when Anderson and Embree combined on a 3-2 victory over the
slugging Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Embree was acquired Tuesday from Atlanta for Russ Springer. The
somewhat flaky left-handers (there is probably a redundancy in
that) were teammates with the Cleveland Indians in 1996. Embree was
already with the club when Anderson reported from the minors.
According to Anderson, this is the first thing Embree said to him:
``You wish you threw as hard as I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson recalls thinking, ``That's a real jerk. But impressive,
nonetheless.''
</P>
<P>
   Embree further endeared himself when the two were playing catch,
separated by a short distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He uncorks an 0-2 fastball off my chest,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Embree said, ``I didn't do it on purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Embree said, ``He had that cocky strut, that
gung-ho (expletive) catching flies. I just wanted to knock him down
to size.''
</P>
<P>
   The two parted after that season. Anderson stayed with the
Indians in 1997, went 4-2 and pitched brilliantly in the playoffs
and World Series. Then he was the Diamondbacks' No. 1 pick in the
expansion draft. Embree, meanwhile, was traded to Atlanta as part
of the big Kenny Lofton-Marquis Grissom-David Justice deal. He had
a 3-1 record, and appeared only briefly in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Now they are teammates once more. Against the Mariners, Anderson
pitched seven strong innings before coming out after giving up a
lead-off single to Dan Wilson in the eighth. The Diamondbacks were
up, 2-1. Embree came in and yielded an infield hit to pinch-hitter
David Segui. Joey Cora sacrificed the runners to second and third,
and Alex Rodriguez grounded out, scoring Wilson to tie the score.
</P>
<P>
   Embree got through the ninth inning and then got his first
Diamondbacks victory when Yamil Benitez led off the bottom of the
ninth with a home run off Bobby Ayala. Anderson has yet to win at
Bank One Ballpark, although his last two home starts have been good
enough to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course you want that win, you want to see that `W' next to
your name,'' said Anderson, who was charged with two runs in his
seven innings. ``But we won. The day I start to bitch and moan when
I think I should have won is the day I quit. The bottom line is,
don't give up a hit leading off the eighth inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson gave up just five hits. The only other run off him was
a solo home run by Ken Griffey Jr. in the sixth. It was Griffey's
32nd homer of the year, which leads the American League. Griffey
golfed a low change-up into the right-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can you say?,'' Anderson said. ``He's a great hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson continued to help himself by picking off base runners.
He nailed Rodriguez in the fourth for his seventh pick-off of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Embree also picked off a runner, getting pinch-runner Jeff Huson
in the ninth. That happened after slugger Jay Buhner popped out to
Embree trying to sacrifice. Buhner hadn't sacrificed since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised,'' Embree said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the effectiveness of the Atlanta starters, Embree was
a bit player with the Braves. Here, he already has assumed a major
role, coming in with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where I'm most effective,'' he said. ``Blow-out
situations are no fun.''
</P>
<P>
   And he still throws harder than Anderson. &QL;

ROCKER EDDIE MONEY ARRESTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ERIC MOSES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES -- Veteran rocker Eddie Money, who hit the Top 10 twice
in the 1980s with ``Take Me Home Tonight'' and ``Walk on Water,''
was arrested Sunday night on suspicion of battery and booked at the
Van Nuys jail, a police sergeant said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Apparently he struck some individual,'' said Los Angeles
Police Department Sgt. Christopher Vasquez of the North Hollywood
Division. ``I don't know the particulars. What he was fighting over
or anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Money, a 49-year-old Westlake Village resident, was involved in
an altercation outside an apartment in the 4200 block of Arch Drive
in Studio City, the sergeant said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual that he was involved with made a private
person's arrest for battery,'' Vasquez said. Police received the
call about 9:15 p.m. and took Money into custody, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Money performed a benefit concert to raise
cash for the Newbury Park High marching band.
</P>
<P>
   Money, a former New York City police officer who has a wife and
five children, also had Top 40 hits with ``Baby Hold On,'' ``Two
Tickets to Paradise'' and ``Maybe I'm a Fool.''

   1. SMASHING THE IRON RICE BOWL The preeminent symbol of the
Chinese Communist Party's economic policies has been an unbreakable
iron rice bowl, standing for cradle-to-grave social security. But
with Beijing unable to keep its state enterprises - behemoths that
employ about 76 million workers - afloat, China is teetering
between economic reform and social unrest. At the last count, 15
million workers were officially estimated to be redundant, and the
real number may be higher. Beijing must cushion their fall to avoid
a second Tiananmen Square uprising. The iron rice bowl is cracking
and may soon shatter. By Neil C. Hughes. From Foreign Affairs
magazine. 3,500 words.

   &UR; ALREADY DEAD: A CALIFORNIA GOTHIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Denis Johnson. Harper Perennial, $13.
</P>
<P>
   In this creepy novel populated by a large cast of petty crooks
and wack jobs, an alcoholic marijuana grower facing the twin
threats of disinheritance and retaliation for a cocaine deal gone
bad cooks up a wild scheme with a Nietzsche-quoting drifter. ``Once
Johnson gets his hooks into you -- it takes about two sentences --
it's ... pretty much impossible to stop reading,'' David Gates
wrote here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; AMERICAN SCRIPTURE: MAKING THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Pauline Maier. Vintage, $14.
</P>
<P>
   This feisty and highly original study, selected as one of the
best books of 1997 by the editors of the Book Review, presents the
Declaration of Independence as the embodiment of the American mind
and Colonial experience rather than as a product of Thomas
Jefferson's pen or the expression of some philosophy of natural
rights. By placing the document in the context of 90 previous
declarations issued throughout the colonies, the author ``offers
Americans a fresh perspective on their most treasured national
relic,'' Richard Alan Ryerson wrote here last year.  &UR; ANGEL IN THE
WHIRLWIND: THE TRIUMPH OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION &LR; , by Benson
Bobrick (Penguin, $15.95), reminds readers that the Revolutionary
War was full of amazing stories and characters -- led by a
heaven-sent hero (George Washington) and a world-class villain
(Benedict Arnold). Bobrick ``has studied his subject deeply and
writes about it with real understanding and verve,'' Frederick
Allen said in these pages in 1997. In  &UR; THE LONG AFFAIR: THOMAS
JEFFERSON AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION, 1785-1800 &LR; , by Conor Cruise
O'Brien (University of Chicago, $15), an Irish author locates a
strain of visionary violence in Jefferson's near-religious defense
of the Revolution. In 1996, Richard Brookhiser said this ``cranky
and sweeping'' narrative ``goes a long way to show that the bust
has shoulders of clay.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHITTAKER CHAMBERS: A BIOGRAPHY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Sam Tanenhaus. Modern Library, $16.
</P>
<P>
   The accuser of Alger Hiss gets sympathetic, but not
hagiographic, treatment in this copious biography, which sheds new
light on its famously enigmatic protagonist, especially his
post-Hiss existence. Last year in the Book Review, Arthur
Schlesinger Jr. called this a ``serious and absorbing work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MEDICINE MEN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alice Adams. Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14.
</P>
<P>
   The author demolishes the divine right of American doctorhood by
having her 40-ish heroine wonder whether her crushing headaches are
an allergic reaction to her physicians -- all of them men. Last
year our reviewer, Deborah Mason, lamented the unrelenting
doctor-bashing but said the novel ``in many ways ... is
representative of the bracing frankness and tart ironies of the
Adams oeuvre.'' The same publisher has reissued  &UR; SUPERIOR WOMEN &LR; 
($14), a melancholy group portrait that follows five mismatched
Radcliffe girls -- rich, poor, fat, thin -- through four decades of
growing disappointment and crises of midlife and identity. In 1984
in these pages, Lois Gould admired Adams' ``elegant, rhythmic
style'' and ``fine, wry logic.''

<P>
   &UR; THE LAST GIFT OF TIME: LIFE BEYOND SIXTY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Carolyn G. Heilbrun. Ballantine, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Turning 70, a feminist pioneer and scholar looks back on the
unexpected pleasures, friendships and rewards of her 60s. This
buoyant collection of revelations and reflections is ``like a
letter to a friend, the kind you don't lie to,'' Rebecca Pepper
Sinkler wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRACES: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ida Fink. Translated by Philip Boehm and Francine Prose.
Owl/Holt, $12.
</P>
<P>
   These spare, lucid tales about everyday life among the Jewish
bourgeoisie in Nazi-era Poland mix normalcy with terror, revealing
the avid need of accountants, housewives and piano students to live
fully even in the shadow of death. ``Fink's gift is for the
delicate miniature, the oblique detail that freezes the reader's
heart,'' Fernanda Eberstadt said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OUR GUYS: THE GLEN RIDGE RAPE AND THE SECRET LIFE OF THE
PERFECT SUBURB &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Bernard Lefkowitz. Vintage, $15.
</P>
<P>
   This disturbing account of the highly publicized rape of a
mentally retarded girl by a group of teen-age athletes suggests
that similar crimes are being committed across the nation and that
much of the fault lies in America's cult of the sports hero. Last
year in the Book Review, Russell Banks called this ``a calm,
methodical, painstakingly researched book ... that should be read
by parents and educators alike.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KOWLOON TONG &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Theroux. Mariner, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A British mother and her 43-year-old son living in Hong Kong
confront the imminent ``Chinese take-away'' with passive rage and
resentment in this novel. ``Theroux's astringent misanthropy and
narrative momentum are powerful propellants,'' Thomas Keneally
wrote here in 1997. Many of the 60-odd tales in Theroux's
 &UR; COLLECTED STORIES &LR;  (Penguin, $15.95) are inhabited by ordinary
no-nonsense people who find themselves immersed in Gothic
goings-on, or solitary narrators whose anonymity is threatened by
outside forces. ``Theroux displays ... a remarkable ear,'' William
H. Pritchard wrote here last year. ``He ... inhabits his sentences
in a rewardingly comic way.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

CLINTON FINDS CHINESE NATIONALISM ALIVE AND WELL ON CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
   A News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI _ Questions posed to President Clinton by Chinese
university students Monday reflected nationalistic sentiments that
recall China's historic fear of foreigners and foreign culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have asked me some very good questions today that have an
element of criticism in them,'' Clinton told students and faculty
at Peking University before flying to the fabled port city of
Shanghai, the commercial hub at the mouth of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
   Five of seven questions posed to Clinton by students at Peking
University reflected undercurrents of nationalism or anti-foreign
sentiment. Many Chinese still resent the foreign intervention that
began in the early 1800s with Europeans' forced creation of trading
enclaves followed later by Japanese occupation that didn't end
until allied victory in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   THe hour-long nationally-televised appearance with the students
saw Clinton challenged by questions about U.S. weapons sales to
Taiwan and U.S.-Japanese security arrangements that some Chinese
worry is aimed at China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the students' sharp-edged questions will help him
``understand how what I say is perceived by others'' and enable him
to tailor his approach so that he can ``be a more effective
president for my people and for the things we believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his team urged greater democratic reforms, saying
the changes promise more prosperity for a nation with a paltry per
capita annual income of $750 _ barely 3 percent of citizens of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want China to be successful, secure and open,'' Clinton
said. ``Our two nations will be far better off working together
than apart.''
</P>
<P>
   One student, seeking to defend China's indignation over U.S.
weapons sales to nearby Taiwan, asked whether Clinton would allow a
foreign nation to sell missiles to Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said U.S. sales of defensive weapons to Taiwan should
not impede reunification negotiations between Beijing and Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   The students' questions won greater applause than Clinton's
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask me: `Do I really want to contain China?''' Clinton
told one student. ``The answer is no. I want partnership. I'm not
hiding another design behind a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Students and faculty members said they welcomed Clinton's visit
to China _ the first by an American president since the 1989
crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators that left up to 800 dead
and hundreds more imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   Meng Zhaorong, a Peking University faculty member in her
mid-60s, called Clinton's overtures ``very necessary because they
help our two nations understand each other.'' But Meng complained
that Clinton is spending too much time with China's leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope President Clinton comes back to China to talk to the
masses and the average people,'' Meng said.
</P>
<P>
   Jian Yi, 22, one of 24,000 students at the elite university,
said Clinton's visit is merely a beginning. ``Relations will be
even better if the next president after 2000 comes to Beijing,''
Jian said.
</P>
<P>
   A 19-year-old junior from Harbin near the Russian border who is
majoring in business management said Clinton's foray shows ``quite
a different attitude than other U.S. leaders who view China through
the past. The student, who declined to be identified, said
Clinton's ``attitude will help our generation in the 21st
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhang Yun, a student who heard Clinton's remarks on a radio,
said Clinton misunderstands China's record on human rights. His
critiques ``do not suit the conditions in today's China,'' Zhang
said. ``His understanding of China is not very deep or complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang Yushi, 20, a computer major, said that China ``can't go in
one step from a stable socialist country to everyone having freedom
of speech, freedom of assembly.'' Yushi added: ``It would lead to
chaos. We need to go slowly.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Roth, assistant secretary of state for East Asian
affairs and a Clinton adviser, said China's next generation of
leaders reflects ``some real friendship'' for the United States
offset by ``the growing nationalism'' of current leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something that we have to deal with in the future,''
Roth added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton carefully couched his appeals for greater democratic
freedoms with the promise that ``freedom strengthens stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on a nine-day visit to five Chinese cities, did not
mention the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Taiwan or Tibet during
a 31-minute address to more than 500 students and faculty members
that was broadcast across this nation of 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The freest possible flow of information, ideas and opinions
and a greater respect for divergent political and religious
convictions will actually breed strength and stability,'' Clinton
said. ``It is therefore profoundly in your interest and the world's
that young Chinese minds be free to reach the fullness of their
potential.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 28, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeated Monday..
</P>
<P>
   ECON-NINETIES-REVIEW _ Suddenly, these are nervous times for
prosperity fans. The stock market has the jitters. The Asian
economic boom, another great engine of American prosperity, is
over. And the nation's economy shows signs of slowing. Is this the
beginning of the end of the Soaring Nineties? By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERCOMPUTERS-REVIEW _ In supercomputing, the time separating
the world's fastest computer from the scrap-metal heap is
appallingly short. But when it comes to supercomputers, to become
obsolescent isn't necessarily to become useless. While many of
these machines are mothballed in dank basements, a few are proudly
displayed in private homes as though they were objets d'art. By
John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-CRIME-REVIEW _ Not so long ago, Mexico seemed a
reasonably safe place, especially when compared with the violent
inner cities of the United States. But that has changed. Now
virtually every day, terrifying new crimes dramatize the country's
public security crisis. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-WAR-REVIEW _ A clamor is rising on all sides for an end
to decades of political violence here, so a weekly news magazine,
Cambio 16, had the novel idea of asking each of the parties to
state its goals for waging war. By Diana Jean Schemo.
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENTIAL-POWER-REVIEW _ The widespread perception of Clinton
as a weak or ineffective president is belied by a largely unnoticed
reality. He is continually stretching his executive and regulatory
authority to put his stamp on policy. He has issued a blizzard of
executive orders, regulations, proclamations and other decrees to
achieve his goals, with or without the blessing of Congress. By
Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   CHURCH-STATE-REVIEW _ If the separation of church and state
mandated by the First Amendment means anything, surely it bars
state-paid teachers from evangelizing to public schoolchildren in
state-provided classrooms during school hours. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-PITFALLS-REVIEW _ Pitfalls aplenty have lurked around
every corner during President Clinton's visit to China. Political
pitfalls: What to say about Tiananmen Square? Protocol pitfalls:
How to overcome the president's habitual tardiness, which would
surely grate on Chinese ideas of punctuality? By R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   JERUSALEM-REVIEW _ The fear in Israel: next year in Jerusalem.
The expansion of Jerusalem's municipal jurisdiction has outraged
not only Arabs but also Jews who had moved to the suburbs to avoid
its taxes, and who will now find themselves back in Jerusalem. By
Serge Schemann.
</P>
<P>
   IRS-REFORM-REVIEW _ After building a case that the Internal
Revenue Service all too often harasses and intimidates taxpayers,
Congress wrapped up work last week on a bipartisan bill to rein in
the agency. Taxpayers will get more legal protections when they get
into disputes with the IRS. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   RECOVERED-MEMORY-REVIEW _ A blockbuster of a story launched a
highly touted current-affairs television program. But its central
allegation was false and based on a disputed interviewing technique
involving recovered memories that the American Psychiatric
Association has condemned. According to the report on ``Newsstand:
CNN &AMP; Time,'' U.S. Special Forces troops dropped sarin nerve gas in
1970 while attacking a Laotian village that was presumed to be
harboring American defectors. By Joe Sharkey.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-CHINA-REVIEW _ Our trouble with China, and vice versa. By
Seth Faison.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In supercomputing, the time separating the
world's fastest computer from the scrap-metal heap is appallingly
short.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to supercomputers, to become obsolescent isn't
necessarily to become useless. While many of these machines are
mothballed in dank basements, a few are proudly displayed in
private homes as though they were objets d'art. They can also make
dandy space heaters.
</P>
<P>
   The obsolescence of a supercomputer is predictable. The reason,
of course, is Moore's Law. Three decades ago, the co-founder of
Intel Corp., Gordon Moore, observed that every 18 months it is
possible to place about twice the number of transistors on the same
piece of silicon. So now personal computers are nearly as fast as
yesterday's supercomputer _ which cost many thousands of dollars
more.
</P>
<P>
   The life span of a supercomputer, which may cost upwards of $30
million, is typically five years, and sometimes far less. Jack
Dongarra, a computer scientist at the University of Tennessee who
maintains an annual list of the world's 500 fastest computers,
finds that about 250 machines fall off his list yearly.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no pasture to go out to when a supercomputer is
retired. No one reharnesses it to do the billing statements for the
local waterworks. The life of a machine is nasty, brutish and
short.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the connoisseurs.
</P>
<P>
   In a warehouse in suburban Seattle, Nathan Myhrvold, Microsoft's
chief scientist, keeps a growing collection now numbering six
supercomputers _ three early Crays and three Connection Machines
made by Thinking Machines Corp. The Cray 1, designed in 1976 by the
legendary inventor Seymour Cray, was notable in part because it was
a round refrigerator-shaped cabinet encircled by a padded bench,
which was just the thing for technicians who needed to work on the
machine's innards.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the original Crays have less processing power than some
$1,000 personal computers, but as fashion statements, their time
may be here again.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold is now planning a new home that will rival that of his
boss, Bill Gates. It will have a living room big enough for a
supercomputer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key aesthetic is that it is the most expensive sofa in the
world,'' said Myhrvold, who bought his machines for their salvage
costs or for a few thousand dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Myhrvold is not the only computer designer who finds the
furniture concept attractive. Not long ago Brewster Kahle, one of
the founders of Thinking Machines Corp., learned that one of the
company's Connection Machines was sitting unplugged in the basement
of the Yale University computer science department.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that old supercomputers are remarkably expensive to
run. Electricity for a Cray 1 would cost $30,000 a month with an
additional $30,000 in electricity costs for the refrigeration
system, according to Dag Spicer, manager of historical collection
at the Computer Museum History Center in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The operating cost didn't bother Kahle, however; he paid Yale
$500 for the Connection Machine and then spent $1,000 for shipping.
It now sits in storage under a staircase in San Francisco, near his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Kahle has big plans for his Connection Machine, which has
thousands of flashing lights and would look right at home on the
flight deck of the starship Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's awfully big,'' said Kahle. ``I think I'm going to need a
conference room to display it in, or maybe my next living room.''
</P>
<P>
   A small living room didn't constrain Dan Lynch, an Internet
pioneer who was one of the founders of Cybercash. Lynch, a wine
aficionado, says he has a Cray 1 as an objet d'art in his vineyard
in the Napa Valley along with ``a bunch of tired old '47 Chevys.''
</P>
<P>
   While at Convex, a Texas-based supercomputer company, Steven
Wallach, a computer designer, once used an Alliant supercomputer in
his office as a conversation piece and as partial support for his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   But even Wallach, who was one of the designers featured in Tracy
Kidder's book, ``Soul of a New Machine'' (Atlantic/Little, Brown,
1982), said he was surprised to learn that another Convex employee
had bought a Convex C-1 for its scrap price and was using the
computer to heat his garage.

 THE NEW FEAR IN ISRAEL: NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing. Originally file on Saturday, June(The Week in Review) 
(duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
(bl) 
By SERGE SCHMEMANN c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEVASSERET ZION, Israel _ Through the centuries of dispersion,
Jews affirmed the faith that they would eventually return to Zion
by declaring, ``Next year in Jerusalem!''
</P>
<P>
   But the ancient vow has taken on an unwelcome new meaning for
residents of this sylvan suburb, and others scattered through the
hills west of Jerusalem, that Israel's government wants to annex to
the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
   Having established themselves in Zion's secular prosperity, the
suburbanites here want no part of the Holy City's politics, taxes _
and, most of all, its increasing emphasis on religion.
</P>
<P>
   Their passions were fired last week by the announcement of a
government plan ``for strengthening of Jerusalem's status'' by
expanding city limits far into Israeli territory to the west, and
by extending Jerusalem's ``municipal umbrella'' to Jewish towns and
settlements in disputed territories to the east.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the eastward reach was promptly assailed by
Palestinians, Europe and the U.S. State Department, which have a
strong interest in reviving the stalled progress toward a final
peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But a far greater outcry came from a less expected quarter: the
Israeli suburbanites to the west. Their story explains a lot about
how intricately tied up the peace process is with the internal,
often byzantine, politics of Israelis themselves.
</P>
<P>
   To them, the plan was not a thumb in Yasser Arafat's eye, but
one in their own _ a blatant bid by Mayor Ehud Olmert to solve
Jerusalem's demographic and financial problems with the flick of an
administrative pen, simply by gobbling up suburbs to which
prosperous and secular Jerusalemites have been fleeing, with their
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Olmert effectively told the defectors, you will be in
Jerusalem, like it or not.
</P>
<P>
   And they do not. Shlomo Kanyas, a resident of a nearby hamlet
who owns a garden supply shop here and is a prime mover behind the
bitter resistance to Jerusalem's expansion plan, put it this way:
``I support Jerusalem. I believe Jerusalem is a holy place for the
Jewish people. I'd do anything to keep it like that. But that
doesn't mean I have to live in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is simple. Even as Israel is fiercely battling for
international recognition of Jerusalem as the united and eternal
capital of the Jews, the city's Arab population is growing at a
rate four times as fast as the Jews. At the same time, secular
Israelis are steadily being squeezed out by ultra-Orthodox Jews,
who have far larger families _ and far lower incomes.
</P>
<P>
   Arabs currently account for 30 percent of the total population
of 620,000, and Israeli planners have not been reticent to declare
that this is their preferred limit. According to a recent study by
the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies, keeping the rate at
current levels would mean that Arabs will account for 45 percent of
the population in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that more Jewish residents were leaving
Jerusalem than were moving in, largely because of the high cost of
housing and a dearth of jobs. Another significant statistic was
that while the ultra-Orthodox accounted for only 30 percent of the
Jewish residents of Jerusalem, their children accounted for 58
percent of all children in Jewish kindergartens.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that Jerusalem is the second poorest city in
Israel after Bnei Brak, an ultra-Orthodox city adjacent to Tel
Aviv, and stands to get poorer. Another is that a majority of the
population in Jerusalem do not share the Zionist zeal to affirm it
as the capital of Israel _ the Arabs because they support the
Palestinian claim to Jerusalem, and the ultra-Orthodox because
their feelings for Jerusalem are more religious than political.
</P>
<P>
   The plan adopted by the government, which must still be worked
out by experts, seeks to resolve these various problems by
instantly boosting the Jewish population and tax base of Jerusalem,
and giving the city control over large tracts of vacant land east
and west where attractive housing can be built to lure young
couples _ and to house the rapidly swelling religious population.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as the popular columnist Nahum Barnea wrote in the
newspaper Yediot Ahronot, is that the plan is undemocratic:
``Jerusalem, which is steadily growing more ultra-Orthodox, and has
been deserted by tens of thousands to the suburbs, now pursues
those who have left, along with their property taxes, and forcibly
brings them home.''
</P>
<P>
   Yisrael Kimche, a researcher at the Jerusalem Institute for
Israel Studies, argued further that moving the center of the city
westward would only weaken the old center, and would erode the
green areas between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond all such practical and political concerns, there is the
sad irony that people whose ancestors yearned so ardently for
Jerusalem are now so upset at living there.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
cunning,'' mourned the psalmist from exile by the waters of
Babylon.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of Mevasseret Zion may not have the ancients' way
with words, but the placard outside the local council headquarters
had some of the same ardor: ``Annexation of Mevasseret Zion equals
political violence.'' Those residents who battled the police and
tried to block traffic on the main Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway last
week were not sparing their right hands, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in Jerusalem for five years,'' said Yoram Sason, head
of special events in the Mevasseret Zion council. ``I felt there
was nothing there for me, no community life, no entertainment.
People here left Jerusalem because Jerusalem was not developed, it
had no community services, the education was lacking.'' Here, he
said, the schools were better, property values were higher, taxes
were lower.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sason and Kanyas, whose home is in Beit Zayit nearby,
seemed especially put off that they were members of Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party, and had voted for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``What upsets me is that I voted for Likud, and the government
was supposed to build on the eastern side of Jerusalem,'' said
Kanyas, unwittingly suggesting that his notion of ``political
violence'' did not extend to building on predominantly Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I don't want to live in Jerusalem,'' he quickly
added. ``Jerusalem is very important for us. But we don't have to
live in Jerusalem to feel that Jerusalem is important for the
Jewish people. Not the whole country should live in Jerusalem.''

 DIPLOMACY BY OTHER MEANS: GETTING STINKO ON KEROSENE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June(The Week in Review) 
(lb) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pitfalls aplenty have lurked around every corner
during President Clinton's visit to China. Political pitfalls: What
to say about Tiananmen Square? Protocol pitfalls: How to overcome
the president's habitual tardiness, which would surely grate on
Chinese ideas of punctuality?
</P>
<P>
   By no means least dangerous were the potential dinner-table
pitfalls, like those that confronted the American guest of honor
Saturday night at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The
formal banquet is a Chinese institution, and at its end lies an
inevitable and obligatory round of toasts with the sorghum-based
firewater known as maotai. It smells a lot like JP-4, the stuff
that powers the engines on Air Force One, and it is only slightly
more drinkable.
</P>
<P>
   But drink it visitors must, and it wouldn't do to gag in the
presence of one's host. Richard Nixon knocked maotais back with
Chou En-lai on his historic trip in 1972, and a decade later George
Bush, then vice president, did the same thing with Deng Xiaoping.
``Ganbei,'' the Chinese say _ bottoms up, more or less. They mean
the glass, not you.
</P>
<P>
   No sipping is allowed. An aide who went to Beijing with Nixon
recalls that the president and Zhou looked into each other's maotai
cups at the end of each toast to make sure the other had drained
every drop. A forerunner of the Reaganite doctrine of trust but
verify, no doubt.
</P>
<P>
   And all this comes at the end of a multicourse feed where you
are expected to sample every dish. When Bush returned to China as
president in 1989 _ a trip I covered _ his party was served boar's
penis soup, or so the menu translation said. I wondered if it
wasn't a linguistic mishap like ``leg of lamp,'' but boar's penis
soup is what everyone thought it was. We did our duty.
</P>
<P>
   So did the author Theodore H. White, when served suckling pig at
a banquet given by Zhou in Chungking during World War II, when both
were youngsters. White, a correspondent for Time and a Jew,
protested as politely as he could that he did not eat pork. Zhou,
master of every situation even as a junior official, gestured with
his chopsticks and said: ``Teddy, this is China. Look again _ see?
Look. It looks to you like pig. But in China this is not a pig.
This is a duck.'' The writer laughed, shrugged and tucked into his
pork-duck, crackling included.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, they don't care whether you eat all the food, but
they will not tolerate wussing out on vodka. Down the hatch in one
gulp, and once a bottle is opened, it is rude not to finish it
before calling it a night.
</P>
<P>
   I remember more vividly than I would like a dinner on my first
trip to Moscow. I must have been almost 30, with college and the
army behind me, so I should have known better. But I persuaded
myself that I could match some Russian friends glass for rapid
glass, and I very nearly jumped off the balcony of a restaurant
called Praga.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years later, I did a six-month stint in the Soviet
Union, as it was then, and I learned to pace myself. At a farewell
dinner, I paced myself so well, nibbling zakuski between gulps,
that I never even considered a jump.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't. I was out cold, KO'd humiliatingly short of
midnight.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   American presidents have displayed a lot more decorum than I
while exchanging many a toast with Russian leaders over the past
few decades. Some may have learned the old Russian trick of dumping
the contents of a vodka glass into a water glass (which works fine,
as long as they don't catch you, and as long as you don't forget
and take a gulp of ``water'').
</P>
<P>
   Only one president I know of, whose name is probably best
suppressed here, publicly displayed vodka's formidable capacity for
undermining politesse, commenting somewhat indecorously after six
or seven belts upon a female aide's physical attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon handled these things well. He coolly exchanged
vodka toasts with Leonid Brezhnev at his swimming pool at San
Clemente in 1973, with Hollywood stars illuminating the evening. A
wine lover, he also developed an effective if stingy method for
conserving his best stock. He instructed the waiter on the
presidential yacht Sequoia, or so it is said, to wrap bottles in a
white towel before pouring. The president got Chateau Margaux, and
so did his special guests; the others got something less grand from
California.
</P>
<P>
   According to his valet in the days when he was a pitchman for
General Electric, Ronald Reagan had a strategy for postspeech
pow-wows with the company's executives and clients: The valet mixed
water and white wine in a thermos, and when it came time to pour
out the martinis, Reagan was given his relatively benign potion
while the others got their loudmouth soup.
</P>
<P>
   What you really want for toasts, of course, is champagne. The
British usually give you Pol Roger Cuvee Winston Churchill on
august occasions, which strikes me as perfect.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it will never give you a head that jerks like a
jackhammer, or cause the distress to the constitution that the
Australians politely call a Technicolor yawn. Lots of other local
specialties will, especially if you're not used to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of a long career, I have had disquieting
encounters with Danish aquavit (caraway flavored and drunk with a
beer chaser); French marc (made from the pips and skins of grapes
left in the wine press); Vietnamese wine with a pickled snake in
the bottle; various sugar-cane concoctions in the Caribbean, and
fenny, an Indian bruiser made from cashew nuts. All taste a little
like petroleum distillates. One slug makes your knees knock, two
make you drool and three fell you like a redwood.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Unicum, a bitter, syrupy digestive in an
orb-shaped bottle that is said to cure hangovers. It is
manufactured by Peter Zwack, former Hungarian ambassador to
Washington, former member of Parliament and all-around good guy. It
hurts me to say so, but in my experience it is unmatched for sheer
yuckiness. I call it the dark destroyer, even to my friend's face.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the recent American courtship of Mongolia has proved at
least one thing: Tamer drinks can taste just as bad as stronger
stuff. Nomads there drink fermented mare's milk, and visiting
bigwigs are asked to do likewise.
</P>

   On a trip last year, Hillary Rodham Clinton compared the
beverage, called airak, to yogurt. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright didn't compare it to anything, but she sternly instructed
those traveling with her: If you don't want to drink it, ``you must
touch it to your lips as if tasting it.''

LEARNING FROM THE BIG BOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday June 27.) (The Week in Review)

<P>
   Suddenly, these are nervous times for prosperity fans. The stock
market has the jitters; after going straight up all winter it has
been stuck in place since April. The Asian economic boom, another
great engine of American prosperity, is over. And the nation's
economy shows signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Is this the beginning of the end of the Soaring Nineties? Who
knows? There are plenty of economic seers in the land who,
convinced that Americans are more efficient and productive than
ever, see the good times rolling on.
</P>
<P>
   Even the less sanguine say this may be the seventh inning rather
than the ninth. But enough warning flags are up to invite
comparisons with the other great periods of prosperity in modern
history, and how they ended.
</P>
<P>
   What is striking is that each of them _ the Gilded Age in the
late 19th century, the Roaring Twenties, the Fabulous Fifties and
Sixties _ ended suddenly, and in each case the end came as a shock.
The same was true of the more ambiguous period of growth that ended
with the stock-market crash of 1987. The warning signs were there,
but they were overlooked or minimized or simply beyond anyone's
power to control.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stood in 1928 and tried to imagine what the next decade
would be like, you would never have imagined the Great Depression,
and each period of prosperity has been like that,'' said Henry
Kaufman, the Wall Street economist and consultant.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilded Age, for example, ended with the financial panic of
1893. A weakening U.S. currency frightened foreign investors,
particularly the British, and they pulled out their money, helping
to start a four-year depression.
</P>
<P>
   The Roaring Twenties crashed with the stock market in 1929, and
the Great Depression followed.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifties and Sixties gave way to an unlikely combination of
inflation and stagnant economic growth in the 1970s that shook
American confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Another stock-market crash, in 1987, brought the decade of greed
to a humbling conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Or did it really end? The bounce-back in the 1990s, after a
brief recession, brings some historians to the conclusion that the
present decade is really an extension of the 1980s _ half a
generation of almost unbroken prosperity, particularly for
upper-income people.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is remarkable about this era of prosperity is how long it
has lasted and how entrenched the orthodoxy of free markets has
become over all these years,'' said Alan Brinkley, the Columbia
University historian. ``We are really back to an age in which the
reigning ideology is very close to laissez-faire, as it was in the
Gilded Age.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one comparison. There are others. Implicit in them is
the suggestion that the current era of prosperity can be prolonged
by avoiding the mistakes that ended those earlier booms. Let's see.
</P>
<P>
   The Gilded Age Dissolves in Panic
</P>
<P>
   The Gilded Age, which lasted roughly 20 years, was born in the
pell-mell economic growth after the Civil War. Railroads spread
across the country. Steel mills blossomed, and other industries
came into being. Their owners often turned to foreigners,
particularly the British, to finance the projects.
</P>
<P>
   Competition and overexpansion made these new industrialists
vulnerable to bankruptcy. That, in turn, made the lenders nervous.
And then a conflict over the value of the nation's currency finally
pushed the lenders to call in their loans, which brought on the
Panic of 1893.
</P>
<P>
   The value of currency has, in different ways, been a source of
trouble in nearly every period of prosperity. It is an issue in the
maneuvering to prevent today's prosperity from running off the
rails.
</P>
<P>
   When dollars are scarce, their value rises. Reflecting this
higher value, interest rates rise for borrowers, and prices drop
for goods and services. The money, in effect, is worth more than
what it buys.
</P>
<P>
   One way to limit the supply is to pull dollars out of
circulation, as the Federal Reserve Board sometimes does now.
Another is to tie the dollar to gold, the practice in the Gilded
Age, before there was a central bank.
</P>
<P>
   A government pledges to convert each dollar into a fixed amount
of gold. Since there was not that much gold available in the Gilded
Age, the government could not print that many dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every government in the late 19th century adjusted its
economy to the gold standard. In the United States, that galled
farmers. They were a big part of the population, and they were
desperate. Partly because of overproduction, prices for their crops
kept falling. They needed low-interest credit, plenty of it, to
keep going, and because of the gold standard they could not get it.
Nor could they inflate their prices.
</P>
<P>
   The money, in limited supply, grew in value faster than their
produce. Thousands of farmers lost their land.
</P>
<P>
   Their solution was silver, which was much more abundant than
gold. Under pressure from the populist farmers movement, Congress
in 1890 authorized the Treasury to issue dollars backed by silver
as well as gold. That greatly increased the money supply and made
credit available at lower rates. But the dollar lost value. A
``cheap'' silver dollar could be converted into just as much gold
as a dollar backed by gold.
</P>
<P>
   The currency, in effect, was devalued, particularly in the eyes
of lenders in Britain, a country on a pure gold standard. Nervous
already from various bankruptcies, they called in their dollar
loans and converted them into gold _ behaving much as American and
European lenders did last winter when they called in loans to South
Korea and converted them back to hard currencies when that
country's won fell in value.
</P>
<P>
   President Grover Cleveland got the silver act repealed within
months. But that did not lessen the concern that the dollar would
be devalued. And as gold reserves fell below $100 million in April
1893, the panic was on.
</P>
<P>
   The various players in this drama knew the potential
consequences of their actions, historians explain, but given the
passions and the political struggle, no one could stop the process.
</P>
<P>
   That is the great lesson from the Gilded Age: The forces that
unwind a prosperous era take on a life of their own. And that
remains an issue over a century later, particularly in a world that
still views a strong currency as a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   The United States returned firmly to a gold standard only after
the populist farmers' candidate, William Jennings Bryan, lost the
1896 presidential election to William McKinley. By then the
depression had almost run its course. And a surge in the supply of
gold, from new mines, brought relief to the farmers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Roaring Twenties End in Depression
</P>
<P>
   The crash of 1929, the bursting of one of those speculative
bubbles that have appeared periodically over the last three
centuries, was probably inevitable. The Great Depression, however,
might have been preventable. The 1987 crash demonstrated that the
damage resulting from a stock-market plunge can be limited. But
that was by no means clear in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   It was another decade of rapid expansion. New technologies
appeared. New industries came into being. There were huge
investments, eye-catching mergers and mass production of
automobiles, appliances and other goods. Most significant, millions
of Americans, for the first time, participated in the stock market.
The small investor had arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The financial markets, in fact, were growing too rapidly for
policy-makers to fully grasp what was happening and develop ways to
deal with the problems that would arise, notes Barry Eichengreen,
an economist at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   The necessary safeguards _ deposit insurance, bank regulation,
stock trading rules, the Securities and Exchange Commission _ came
only in the 1930s. But they stand today as a safety net to mitigate
the damage from a market crash, and from the bankruptcies and bank
failures that accompany it.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve, formed in 1913, was also groping. The panic
of 1893 and another in 1907 had made the need for a central bank
obvious. But its role as a lender of last resort and as a supplier
of cheap credit in hard times would take years to develop. That
role was fully in place in 1987, on the day after the stock market
crash, when Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, lowered interest
rates and announced that the central bank stood ready to make
credit available to keep the stock market and its players solvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve and its foreign counterparts were all
groping in the 1920's toward an understanding of what a lender of
last resort should do domestically,'' said Eichengreen, who is also
an adviser to the International Monetary Fund. Now after the global
financial crisis brought about by Asia's downfall, ``We are groping
toward trying to understand whether we need an international lender
of last resort and, if so, how it should operate,'' Eichengreen
added.
</P>
<P>
   There was another problem pulling at the Fed after the 1929
crash, a replay of a theme that had been so important in the Panic
of 1893. The Fed has been accused of responding to the crash by
raising interest rates, thus restricting credit and demand in the
teeth of the developing Depression _ such behavior being just the
opposite of what was needed.
</P>
<P>
   But in fact the Fed vacillated, lowering rates at times, and
deciding only in 1931 to push them up, said Charles Calomiris, an
economist at Columbia University's Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   What drove the Fed was England's decision to go off the gold
standard. By raising interest rates, the Fed, in effect, made the
dollar more valuable, which meant that dollar holders were less
likely to convert their dollars to gold and once again deplete the
nation's reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost, once again, was a Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commitment to the gold standard constrained how much the
Fed could worry about managing _ stimulating _ demand,'' Calomiris
said. That preference for a strong dollar may still be in play.
</P>
<P>
   The Postwar Years
</P>
<P>
   Never were two decades more prosperous in the United States than
the 1950s and 1960s. Consumer demand, unfulfilled in the Depression
and the war years, drove the economy. So did military spending. The
United States became the supplier to a rebuilding world. Mass
production and marketing made this the most productive era. As the
nation's workers turned out more, their incomes rose. So they spent
more, leaving the impression that the nation's output was
limitless. It was not.
</P>
<P>
   The costly Vietnam War and the Great Society programs strained
the system. Prices, responding to shortages, began to rise in the
late 1960s. The 1973 Arab embargo made oil prices shoot up,
increasing inflation. Japan, Germany and other countries re-entered
the marketplace, cutting into U.S. sales.
</P>
<P>
   That helped to reduce the rate at which the economy,
productivity and incomes grew. None has ever recovered its old
vigor, despite a considerable improvement in the last two years.
Instead, upper-income people have been the big beneficiaries in the
current era of prosperity. Corporate America, freed from many
government constraints, argues that it is stronger because of the
change. But whether the laissez-faire system that has emerged
strengthens the nation's hand for the next crisis is anyone's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are under pressure to stimulate their economy by
issuing more yen. But that weakens the yen, which creates problems
for American and Asian exporters, straining these economies. What
we need, Calomiris said, is a coordinated action in which the
Federal Reserve agrees publicly to expand the American money
supply. The goal would be to offset the Japanese action and keep
currency values constant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greenspan could announce no interest rate increases for six
months,'' Calomiris said. ``That would be an example of the kind of
policy coordination that would be very effective.''
</P>
<P>
   And very uncharacteristic of the Federal Reserve.

 WHAT WENT WRONG? MEXICO CAN'T FATHOM ITS RISING CRIME.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Not so long ago, Mexico seemed a reasonably safe
place, especially when compared with Latin American societies in
the throes of civil war or paramilitary violence. But that's
changed. Now virtually every day, terrifying new crimes dramatize
the country's public security crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Just in recent weeks, a Vermont artist was knifed to death on a
Pacific Coast beach. A kidnapper called a Mexico City newspaper to
boast about hacking off the ears of his hostages and to jeer at the
authorities' inability to stop him. Military police ordered to
investigate the disappearance of scores of people in a city on the
Texas border were themselves arrested collecting a kidnapping
ransom. The State Department has cautioned visiting Americans about
the rising crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican criminologists, sociologists and others are debating
what's gone wrong. How did one of the safest countries in the
hemisphere become a place where tourists are panicking and millions
fear criminal attack whenever they leave home?
</P>
<P>
   Some blame the economy, which for 15 years has seen real wages
fall and the breach between rich and poor widen. Some cite
sociology, saying that an entire generation of police officers are
now using their violent skills as participants in organized crime.
Others trace the crisis to the justice system, which is so
discredited that most crimes go unreported, fewer are investigated,
and only a tiny fraction of the perpetrators are ever punished.
</P>
<P>
   Some even blame the growth of democracy, which by stripping
Mexico's ruling party of many of its authoritarian powers has also
diminished its ability to repress crime.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is common to all these explanations. There is a sense
that Mexico's top civilian authorities have lost control of the
country's criminals, who now see lucrative opportunities on all
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``In practical terms, the Mexican state simply doesn't respond
to most crimes,'' said Ernesto Lopez Portillo, co-author of a 1994
study of public security issues. ``The authorities refuse to
recognize the severity of the public security crisis, partly
because it's so frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   The facts are sobering. Although record-keeping is chaotic, and
fear of police keeps many victims from reporting crimes, government
statistics for Mexico City show that reported murders rose by 50
percent from 1990 to 1995 and that robbery incidents have
multiplied six-fold in 15 years. Experts estimate that kidnappings
in Mexico, once rare, now number at least 1,500 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Ruiz Harrell, a professor who is one of Mexico's most
meticulous crime statisticians, has charted annual figures for all
reported crimes since 1930 and concluded: ``There's a clear
association between economic crisis and crime.''
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years after 1930, Mexican workers enjoyed an almost
uninterrupted rise in their standard of living, and in those years,
he says, crime declined with equal constancy, even though Mexican
wages remained far below the standard in the United States. But
beginning in 1983, the first year after an economic crisis sent
wages into free-fall, crime rates took off, and they have yet to
level out. In 1995, the year following a disastrous peso
devaluation, reported crimes in Mexico surged 35 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before in our history has crime grown this rapidly,''
Ruiz said. ``The figures speak for themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Economic determinism has its critics, however, including
President Ernesto Zedillo. In an appearance in June in New York,
Zedillo said that attributing street crime to economic factors
amounts to blaming the poor. Instead, he said, the problem lies
with the ``inefficiency'' of Mexico's crime-fighting institutions.
</P>
<P>
   How do inefficient police and prosecutors translate into more
crime? ``Potential criminals act rationally and base their decision
to commit a crime on an analysis of costs and benefits,'' said a
recent World Bank study of crime in Latin America. Potential
criminals, it said, estimate the payoff of a crime, the costs
associated with committing it, and the probability of punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Those who apply this calculus in Mexico see that crimes like
kidnapping and drug trafficking have proven extremely lucrative in
recent years, and punishment is rare.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mexico as elsewhere, crime is a career option that competes
with others,'' said Lopez. Many Mexicans are turning to crime
because punishment is remote. The criminal justice system is
chaotic; the country has had seven attorney generals in nine years,
and turnover among lower officials is higher. Given the disorder,
Lopez estimated that of each 100 crimes reported to authorities,
only five are investigated.
</P>
<P>
   But Mexico's justice system has never worked efficiently, so why
is crime surging now? Until recently, Lopez said, government
officials from the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, known
as the PRI, controlled the criminal class, often favoring one mafia
in exchange for kickbacks while suppressing rival groups and never
allowing crime to surpass certain bounds. But as the PRI has begun
to share power, it has lost control of the criminals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old rules no longer apply and new ones haven't emerged,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lucio Mendoza, a former analyst at the national security agency
who now runs a research organization, said the authorities have not
only lost control but that members of the police are now the main
organizers of crime.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in the late 1960s, he said, successive presidents gave
the police, especially members of an elite corps known as the
Federal Security Directorate, license to eliminate accused
subversives by whatever means they felt necessary. By the early
1980s guerrillas had been suppressed, and the police turned their
extralegal skills to organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a cancer that expanded,'' Mendoza said. ``They
went into drugs, car theft, kidnaps, piracy, truck hijackings. This
is the cause of the crime rates we see today.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a recent newsletter, Mendoza cited 39 articles published in
major Mexican newspapers between May 22 and June 9, each detailing
spectacular police criminality.
</P>
<P>
   One said Mexico City police officers, using a government
computer, were identifying and then threatening citizens who report
crime. Another reported the arrest of 11 police officers who were
trafficking in migrant workers in the state of Veracruz. Another
said a federal agent had organized a prison break in the state of
Tamaulipas, which borders Texas.
</P>
<P>
   If the hypotheses put forward to explain the crime surge are
tidy, criminality is complex, and what seems to make sense in one
place may not in another.
</P>
<P>
   Homicide, for instance, has jumped dramatically in Tijuana and
Ciudad Juarez, cities that are the main border drug corridors;
organized crime is clearly at work there. Murder is also rampant in
the Mexico City suburbs, where the newly rich are building luxury
residences alongside slums. There, some believe that growing
economic inequality is the cause, since, as the criminologist
Lawrence Sherman of the University of Maryland says, ``Inequality
is a major predictor of homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Some crimes and the investigations of them become so byzantine
that they support various hypotheses. One such case was the murder
of a senior banking executive, found dead in his car last August.
Because his watch was missing, the authorities said he had been
killed during a robbery; the economic crisis seemed to blame.
</P>
<P>
   But then, as the case dragged on, new factors seemed to be at
play. No arrests were made in this prominent case for 10 months;
this demonstrated anew to millions of Mexicans that crime does
indeed pay and added weight to the theory that lawlessness is
surging because few crimes are punished. Then developments
supported those who put police depradations at center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, the police charged a 28-year-old laborer,
Sergio Diaz, with the murder. But then chagrined prosecutors
released him, based on his bizarre story. He said the police
officers who arrested him had kidnapped him last year, holding him
until his family paid a $9,000 ransom. But Diaz had dared to file
kidnapping charges, and several officers were eventually arrested,
though quickly released. They set about getting even, and
eventually framed him on the murder charges. Prosecutors concluded
that Diaz had nothing to do with the murder. The police have not
been punished.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen protests over many similar outrages appear to have
gotten the government's attention. On June 12, Interior Minister
Francisco Labastida announced a bigger crime budget.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say anti-crime efforts are still moving slowly. One
example: In the mid-1980s, the government promised to compile a
single, computerized file of information on all Mexican police
officers, thus helping the authorities to avoid hiring criminals.
Three presidencies and nearly 15 years later, the list is still
incomplete; now Zedillo's aides are promising to finish it.
</P>
<P>
   When will the registry be done, an Interior Ministry official
was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to give a date,'' he said.

 IN COLOMBIA, ACCORD COMES WITHOUT PEACE

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ A clamor is rising on all sides for an end to
decades of political violence here, so a weekly news magazine,
Cambio 16, had the novel idea of asking each of the parties to
state its goals for waging war.
</P>
<P>
   In their separate wish lists, all of the players _ the assorted
leftist groupings, the right-wing paramilitaries, the government _
spoke of land reform, of opening the political landscape for new
movements, of investing more in education and health, and of
Colombians gaining greater benefits from the country's natural
resources. Even the right-wing paramilitaries questioned the value
of an unfettered free market.
</P>
<P>
   So striking were the similarities that the magazine's cover that
week featured head shots of the main actors. ``So Then, Why Are
They Fighting?'' it asked.
</P>
<P>
   That question has become more pressing with the election last
Sunday of Andres Pastrana as the next president of Colombia, on a
platform in which the top priority was negotiating an end to the
political violence that has claimed more than 31,000 lives so far.
</P>
<P>
   It has also become more relevant in Washington, where the
administration is growing more involved in Colombia in activities
that could intensify war and in measures that could bring peace.
</P>
<P>
   Quietly, the Pentagon has been aiding the Colombian military in
the name of fighting drug trafficking, though it acknowledges that
the training and equipment may be used to fight insurgents
unconnected to the drug trade. At the same time, the State
Department has been sponsoring informal seminars that bring the
parties to the Colombian conflict into contact with veterans of
peace negotiations in Guatemala and El Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Over nearly four decades, the conflict in Colombia has come to
resemble nothing so much as the old commercials for Timex watches
that, strapped to a horse's hoof or the wheel of a car, just kept
on ticking. In the rest of Latin America, rebels have laid down
their weapons, as in Guatemala; tried their hand at government, as
in Nicaragua, or been crushed by government forces, as in Peru. But
in Colombia, the gruesome conflict keeps on plumbing new depths of
horror.
</P>
<P>
   Eerily, Colombia still betrays the language, suspicions and
reflexes of the Cold War. Senior military officers contend the
rebels are out to take power and establish a narco-communist state,
and they brand human rights workers as guerrillas. The rebels seem
unconvinced by communism's defeat in Europe, insisting there must
be something better _ a post neo-liberal, post-Cuban model for
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious and frequent reason experts cite for the
continued fighting here is drug trafficking, which bankrolls both
the rebels and the most important paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
   Intelligence analysts estimate that the rebels collect some $100
million a year in commissions for protecting landing strips, crops
and labs in zones they control, while two major paramilitary
leaders in Colombia have become drug dealers ``involved in all
aspects of the drug trade,'' according to one U.S. intelligence
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has ever portrayed the insurgents as enjoying an easy
life thanks to drug funds. Their fighting forces live in the
mountains, rise by dawn and change camps every few days to elude
detection, said Daniel Garcia Pena, who heads the Colombian
government's peace commission. The funds have, though, provided all
sides with the means to wage a war that has become a way of life,
ideological declarations aside.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the declarations do not tell the whole story. What does
talk about a future, scaled-back role for the military say about
the resentment that seethes and multiplies when whole villages of
peasants are forced from their homes by one side or the other?
</P>
<P>
   One member of the leading guerrilla group, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, said he had been active in his church as
a young man but joined the rebels after the military murdered his
wife because of his leftist sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Castano tells a brutal story of how his brother Fidel
created the right-wing paramilitaries after their father died in
the custody of guerrillas who kidnapped him for ransom nearly 20
years ago. The father was tied to a tree and, perhaps mad with fear
and confinement, he stretched the tether to its limit and ran
headlong into the trunk, crushing his head, said an educator with
close ties to the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   These are intimate hatreds, whose ghosts fly across generations
and borders.
</P>
<P>
   And even within the public lists of their goals, the same words
_ agrarian reform, political reform _ have different meanings on
different lips. In some cases, they have no meaning at all.
</P>
<P>
   For some rebels, land reform is a way of distributing large
estates that are not personally worked by their owners. At the
other end, Castano, the paramilitary leader whose death squads
commit about 70 percent of all the political murders, runs a banana
cooperative in Uraba that, he says, is a model of agrarian reform.
Skeptics say the cooperative is only an effort by the
paramilitaries to establish political credentials, and a way to
repopulate areas they have emptied of other peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Now, people here are wondering whether this grinding conflict
has really reached a turning point, given an emerging public
consensus that government forces have not managed to defeat the
rebels on the battlefield. No cease-fire is required for peace
talks to begin, so analysts here expect conflict and dialogue will
intensify at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia may well move toward peace as it has through war,
bloodily and tangled in contradictions.

 CHINA AND AMERICA: FRIENDS IN NEED OF HEARING AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
(duplication warning: also sent with `i' code) 
 (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ About the last thing President Clinton wanted to hear
during the first day of his visit to China was that the authorities
had rounded up several dissidents in Xian, the city where he landed
Thursday evening. Yet keeping naysayers away when any big public
event occurs is pretty much the way things work in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's trip was carefully planned to show as much of the
nonpolitical side of China as possible _ villagers, business
executives and teachers are on the itinerary _ and part of the
intention was evidently to keep from being swamped in debates over
human rights. The President could not avoid speaking about human
rights altogether, but he evidently wanted to avoid dwelling on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   But there it was anyway, and it arguably made sense, as Clinton
did, to speak about his country's own beliefs rather than to
lecture his hosts about their own shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights is one of those issues, like self-determination for
Taiwan, that so fundamentally divide the United States and China
that no amount of summitry can bridge the difference. And the U.S.
and Chinese presidents, despite all the reasons they may have to
improve relations and cooperate on security and economic issues,
are almost permanently vulnerable to unexpected and unpredictable
flare-ups over these questions.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions about schemes by the Chinese military, or campaign
financing scandals, are likely to come and go like other political
fads in Washington. Yet on a deeper level officials and the general
populace in China and the United States still have fundamentally
different ways of looking at the same issue, and that's where the
problem lies. Often the problems can be set off not by some
centrally organized plan, but by some local potentate or
institution taking initiative on its own, in an act that the other
side nevertheless sees as having import far beyond the local scene.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the dissidents in Xian is a telling example of how
the basic points of view can differ. To the American news media,
any story about a harassed dissident is newsworthy on the day the
president arrives, because human rights in China is a live
political issue in Washington. More important, any whiff of human
rights violations speaks directly to American convictions about
political freedom, so this kind of report can often have a deep
resonance in an American audience.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Chinese response to the story, as relayed to U.S.
officials, was honest: The officials did not want the dissidents to
disrupt the proceedings of the president's arrival. And that kind
of thinking is not limited to Chinese leaders; it also reflects
what ordinary Chinese people say. Whatever these people may think
about the broader value of free expression, Clinton's arrival is so
important an event, in the Chinese view, that anything that
interferes with it even in a peripheral way is best discouraged .
</P>
<P>
   A more serious incident occurred when Harry Wu, the Chinese-born
human rights advocate, was apprehended trying to enter China in
1995 to try to document abuses in China's prison system.
</P>
<P>
   To the vast majority of Americans, China's two-month detention
of Wu was reprehensible and violated any humane standard of
decency. To the vast majority of Chinese, who typically care little
for the rights of prisoners, Wu was a self-serving hype artist who
was only poking about to draw attention to his cause. There was
precious little overlap in the two views.
</P>
<P>
   In one day, Wu's arrest came out of nowhere to cause a serious
rift in U.S.-Chinese relations. Each government was limited by
strong domestic pressures, and it took two months to reach an
acceptable diplomatic solution _ China sentenced Wu to 15 years in
prison for spying, but then released him _ because the views of the
two governments were so far apart.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, a similarly intractable thorn between Washington and
Beijing, is also prone to producing unexpected problems in
U.S.-Chinese relations.
</P>
<P>
   When Cornell University invited Taiwanese President Lee Tung-hui
to commencement in 1995, so many Americans supported Lee's visit _
which he had skillfully portrayed as a simple request for a U.S.
visa by an alumnus to his alma mater, when it actually meant far
more _ and so many Chinese opposed it, that it set the stage for
what happened in March 1996, when the United States and China came
close to military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most comic recent example of U.S.-Chinese
differences, or perhaps the most tragic, occurred in Shanghai last
week.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Lincoln Center Festival, having commissioned a
classic Chinese opera to be performed in a modern interpretation in
New York next month, was suddenly told that Shanghai's Bureau of
Culture had blocked the opera troupe's elaborate sets, costumes and
props _ all paid for and technically owned by Lincoln Center _ from
being shipped at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Although the director of the Bureau of Culture argued that
artistic concerns were at issue, it became evident in negotiations
with Lincoln Center that petty political motives _ power over
artistic troupes, professional jealousy, the right to censor _
played an even more powerful role. This was no central Chinese
government decision; it was a local official wielding authority.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans can simply not accept the idea that ! government
official might block an artistic project for no good reason, or
might dictate what is legitimate art or might simply make himself
the sole arbiter of artisitic taste. To most Chinese, even ones who
care about art, succumbing to officialdom is a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, what might ordinarily have been an arcane dispute
about a classic Chinese opera, hardly an art form that draws much
popular attention outside China (or inside, for that matter), took
on an unexpectedly political element because it occurred in the
days prior to Clinton's arrival in China.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Lincoln Center's expectation, it finally had to
cancel plans to stage the opera in New York, because negotiations
were going nowhere. It remains conceivable that Clinton could
intervene at the last moment, to try to save what had been called a
shining example of U.S.-Chinese cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if he does, it won't be the last time that relations
between the United States and China are strained by the unexpected
emergence of an issue that cuts to the core of feelings and
concerns on separate sides of the Pacific.

 MEMORIES OF WARS NEVER FOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A blockbuster of a story launched a highly touted television
program. But its central allegation was largely based on a disputed
interviewing technique involving recovered memories that the
American Psychiatric Association has condemned.
</P>
<P>
   Recovered memories _ suppressed horrors dredged up under therapy
_ drew attention a few years ago when they became the basis of a
spate of charges of incest, satanic-ritual abuse and sexual abuse
at child-care centers. They were discredited when investigators
determined that many of them had been implanted by zealous
therapists determined to find a cause for a patient's emotional
distress.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, experts have discovered that some Vietnam-era
veterans under psychiatric care in Veterans Administration
Hospitals are especially suggestible. Recovered memories have made
a comeback, and veterans, they say, find themselves ``remembering''
events that never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics assert that may be the case in a disputed report
alleging that U.S. soldiers used nerve gas in the Vietnam War.
According to ``Newsstand: CNN &AMP; Time,'' U.S. Special Forces troops
used the gas, sarin, in 1970 while attacking a Laotian village that
was presumed to be harboring U.S. defectors.
</P>
<P>
   By using poison gas in the Vietnam War, U.S. soldiers would have
committed an act regarded internationally as a war crime. And in
covering it up for 28 years, the Pentagon would be seen as damaging
U.S. efforts to expose and eliminate Iraq's suspected caches of
nerve gas.
</P>
<P>
   The report by veteran CNN war correspondent Peter Arnett and
producer April Oliver, who did most of the reporting, was broadcast
June 7 and appeared the next day in Time magazine. As a result of
the report, the Pentagon began an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But the air soon began hissing out of the story. Veterans who
had taken part in the mission, called Operation Tailwind, bombarded
the Internet and news media with furious rebuttals. Yes, they had
used gas, they said _ nonlethal tear gas. CNN's own military
analyst, the retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Perry Smith, resigned in
protest when the network wouldn't retract the report.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Newsweek magazine dropped its own bomb. It
revealed that a former Army lieutenant who had participated in the
mission, Robert Van Buskirk, was the primary source for the
nerve-gas allegation, and that he suddenly recalled the use of
sarin only near the end of a five-hour interview with Ms. Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   But Van Buskirk had failed to mention sarin in ``Tailwind''
(Word Books), his 1983 book about the mission. He said he had
suppressed the memories when he experienced a religious awakening
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the program nor the article mentioned that the central
accusation was based on recovered memories.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said last week that several other veterans who had been
interviewed for the report told him Ms. Oliver ``planted'' the
notion that sarin had been used in the commando raid. CNN has
denied that.
</P>
<P>
   CNN said Friday that it had hired Floyd Abrams, the noted First
Amendment lawyer, to review its reporting and declined further
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But experts in the field of false memories say it is not
difficult to manipulate a susceptible subject, given the right
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recovering a false memory as a war atrocity is not as unusual
as you might think,'' said Pamela Freyd, the executive director of
the False Memory Syndrome Foundation, a national organization of
doctors and researchers that has worked to identify false memories.
</P>
<P>
   No one denies that sexual abuse or war atrocities occur, said
Dr. Loren Pankrantz, a psychologist in Portland, Ore., who worked
for 25 years at a Veterans Administration hospital that treated
Vietnam veterans complaining of post-traumatic stress disorder. But
he added, ``I would be extremely reluctant to believe somebody who
told me they had recovered a memory that had been repressed from
the Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   Pankrantz, who wrote ``Patients Who Deceive'' (Charles Thomas
Press, 1998), a book on post-traumatic stress disorder, said that a
long, intense interview with a subject who is troubled, easily led
to conclusions or eager for approval was ``exactly the context in
which false memories occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a subject might repeat a false account that has been
mentioned earlier in the interview, suddenly believing it to be a
true personal experience. ``Given sufficient pressure and
confusion,'' Pankrantz said, ``they'll say, `Oh, yeah, maybe that
DID happen. Yeah, I remember something about nerve gas now,' The
trouble is, he doesn't know whether that memory came from a few
hours earlier in the interview, or 35 years earlier in the field.''
</P>
<P>
   In clinical settings, some subjects are emotionally disturbed,
some are seeking more generous disability payments _ and some even
also have a kind of Homeric impulse. ``They're basically great
raconteurs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Van Buskirk said he was diagnosed with
post-traumatic stress disorder at a VA hospital in 1977 or 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was under treatment for 10 years with lithium and
mind-bending drugs,'' said Van Buskirk. He was classified 60
percent disabled, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allan Young, an anthropologist at McGill University in
Montreal who wrote ``The Harmony of Illusions: Inventing
Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder'' (Princeton University Press, 1996)
said he was ``very, very dubious'' about the claims on the CNN
program. Young spent two years at a VA hospital in the United
States studying Vietnam veterans claiming emotional disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   He has been fascinated by new narratives emerging as Vietnam
fades in memory, he said. While many patients obviously had arduous
combat experiences, a growing number of cases ``involve a veteran
who was not in Vietnam _ or if he was in Vietnam, he was not in
combat,'' he said. In group therapy sessions, these patients
assemble shards of others' claims and even snippets of movies into
fantasies of personal combat experiences, usually of heroic actions
or harrowing peril.
</P>
<P>
   But more intriguing, he said, is a small subdivision of that
group _ men who falsely implicate themselves in atrocities. ``They
make up war crimes for themselves,'' Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Why would anybody do that?
</P>
<P>
   Young said that a motive could involve a quest for sympathy, for
bigger disability payments or something far simpler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guaranteed attention,'' he said.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Students and Clinton put on dubious show
 &HT;    (For release, July 1, 1998.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   William Jefferson Clinton may be faster on his feet, and able to
duck a jab, better than was Muhammad Ali in his prime. He showed it
the other night while answering questions from students at Peking
University, the birthplace of student dissent that led to the
horror at Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   But how much of what he had to say in response to the students'
unanticipated tough questioning was a smoke screen; condescending
language while working his way offstage?
</P>
<P>
   One could go over the text of the questions, and the responses
of the president, and apply it to general U.S. policy. Substitute
Libya or Cuba for China and you have some interesting
ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the United States do not trust the Chinese communists.
I'm not limiting that to Clinton's political antagonists in the
Congress _ they'll say they're appalled by anything he says or does
_ but there is little since China's intercession in the Korean War
that gives us any reason to trust them.
</P>
<P>
   While we place nations such as Syria and Iran on a list of
pariahs for selling arms to what we perceive to be our enemies, we
do not cast China in that same light. And China is serving up a lot
of hardware to terrorist groups and nations.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton was confronted by one student who questioned our
continued military support of Taiwan, an island the Chinese have
historically considered to be a part of China, he double-talked for
diplomacy's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's response was that we sell arms to Taiwan for defensive
reasons only. That's cute language, but hopefully the translators
sent the real meaning back to the students. That would have been
that the U.S. believes Taiwan remains under continuous military
threat from Mainland China, and we'll stop selling arms to Taiwan
when China stops rattling its sabers in that direction, stops
holding intimidation-based naval maneuvers off Taiwan's coast.
</P>
<P>
   Curious to me throughout the televised question-and-answer
period was that all the questions came from the same side of the
auditorium, from that section of the room to his right.
</P>
<P>
   This, alone, makes me suspicious that either the Clinton people
agreed to pre-arranged questioners or that the Chinese authorities
hand-selected the questioners and placed them in the same area for
convenience. Spontaneity and truth may have suffered.
</P>
<P>
   If one really expected one of the students to say something
critical of the Chinese government, he was fooling himself. The
last thing the Chinese would want would be for such a display to
appear on worldwide TV.
</P>
<P>
   It would be my assumption that everyone in that audience was
there because Chinese government officials wanted them there. And
Chinese government officials certainly did not want dissidents in
the audience.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton really meant his ``we're all God's children''
analogy, both in the auditorium and at the Protestant church
service the day before, then we would not be dealing with
embargoes, boycotts and sanctions throughout the world. Whatever
reasons those smaller countries gave us to inflict sanctions
against them pale when compared to what the Chinese communists have
done, both within its borders and without, since taking power a
half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   What Clinton was meaning but not saying is that the United
States doesn't want to mess with a huge country like China, that
we'll put up with the Chinese arming the rogues of the world
because we, too, arm nations and rogues that other nations and
other rogues think are despicable, that we'll put up with human
rights abuses by China because so many of our allied nations still
have dirty hands when it comes to human rights _ as do we.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, the only real relationship the United States
has with China is colored green and is spelled m-o-n-e-y. It can
make for strange bedfellows.

 UNDER CLINTON, THE PRESIDENTIAL PEN IS MIGHTIER THAN EVER 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
(duplication warning: also sent with `w' code) 
 (bl)  
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton is often perceived as a weak president
_ a lame duck dogged by scandal, thwarted at many turns by a
hostile Republican Congress. His campaign for tobacco-control
legislation foundered this month in the Senate. To top it off, the
Supreme Court last week denied him the power to kill specific items
in tax and spending bills by line item veto.
</P>
<P>
   But the perception of weakness is belied by a largely unnoticed
reality. Clinton is continually stretching his executive and
regulatory authority to put his stamp on policy. He has issued a
blizzard of executive orders, regulations, proclamations and other
decrees to achieve his goals, with or without the blessing of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1995, Clinton authorized the Food and Drug
Administration to declare nicotine an addictive drug, clearing the
way for the most significant government regulations in the history
of the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, after the Senate killed a big anti-tobacco bill,
Clinton ordered a survey of cigarette smoking among teen-agers as a
way to identify those who market most effectively to underage
smokers. Such market research was a key part of the bill that died
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate issue, Clinton last week ordered sweeping new
protections for Medicare beneficiaries. The rules not only carry
out a 1997 law, but go beyond it, adding many of the safeguards
proposed by a presidential advisory commission _ for women, for
people with serious illnesses and for patients who cannot speak
English.
</P>
<P>
   His critics say Clinton is legislating from the executive
branch, often in defiance of Congress. His supporters say he is
prodding, circumventing or overriding a do-nothing Congress that
refuses to address the nation's major problems.
</P>
<P>
   Presidents have used executive orders to work their will since
the earliest days of the Republic, with the boldest actions coming
in times of crisis. Lincoln freed the slaves by proclamation.
Franklin D. Roosevelt created new agencies and placed
Japanese-Americans in detention camps by executive order.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's more modest agenda is more suited to a time of peace
and prosperity. A self-declared policy wonk, he is passionately
interested in details of health, education and welfare programs
that touch the lives of millions.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say many of his initiatives are small-bore. Yet while
ridiculing or denouncing some of them, Congress acquiesces in
others to avoid tough decisions.
</P>
<P>
   To some, this raises separation-of-powers concerns echoing those
posed by the 1996 Line Item Veto Act, which was enacted in part to
give members of Congress political cover by allowing the president
to kill pork-barrel spending. The Supreme Court struck down the
statute last week, saying it violated the procedures set forth in
the Constitution for making law.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Taylor, director of natural resource studies at the Cato
Institute, says legislative authority has been ceded improperly to
the executive branch in other ways. ``This president distinguishes
himself from past presidents by the aggressiveness with which he
has expanded his authority without explicit congressional
approval,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main culprit is Congress, for letting the president get
away with this, and for delegating vague and broad discretionary
powers to the executive in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, Taylor cited as one example
telecommunications legislation mandating that the poor have access
to the Internet and other forms of communication. Congress left the
details to the Federal Communications Commission, and when the FCC
came back to Congress to propose a tax on business to pay for such
``universal access,'' he said, legislators were ``shocked,
shocked'' at the proposed new spending.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Clinton boldly carries off his novel use of
presidential power, as when he tapped a special Treasury fund to
bail out Mexico in 1995, over the objections of Congress. And
sometimes he does not.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1995, Clinton issued an executive order that barred
federal agencies from signing contracts with companies that
permanently replaced striking workers. He said he was simply
exercising his power to set procurement policy for the government.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. Chamber of Commerce denounced the executive order
as a ``political payoff'' to organized labor, and the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia struck it down, saying the
president could not unilaterally ``alter the delicate balance of
bargaining and economic power'' set by Congress in the National
Labor Relations Act.
</P>
<P>
   In the realm of foreign affairs and national security, Clinton
takes ``an expansive view of presidential power over military
initiatives,'' said Louis Fisher, an expert on constitutional law
at the Congressional Research Service.
</P>
<P>
   Citing actions ordered by the president in Somalia, Haiti,
Bosnia and Iraq, Fisher said that ``Mr. Clinton's interpretation of
presidential war power would have astonished the framers of the
Constitution.'' Congress has substantial authority over foreign
affairs, Fisher said, but in recent decades it ``has failed to
protect its prerogatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also stretched his appointment power. After the
Senate blocked the nomination of Bill Lann Lee to run the civil
rights division of the Justice Department, Clinton defiantly named
him acting assistant attorney general last December.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers at the Congressional Research Service say this
designation appears to violate an 1868 law, the Vacancies Act,
which in its current form sets a 120-day limit on such temporary
appointments. The administration disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said the administration was
flouting the law by using temporary appointments to fill 18 percent
of the 320 positions subject to Senate confirmation at various
departments. Without the 120-day limit, Byrd said, ``no president
need ever forward a nomination to the Senate.'' he preside
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's most spectacular unilateral actions came in
1996, on the rim of the Grand Canyon, when he designated 1.7
million acres of Utah's red rock country a national monument. The
step outraged Utah officials and many members of Congress, in part
because it limits development of the land. But Congress failed to
overturn the designation. And the rugged beauty of the area has
become a tourist attraction, as well as a monument to presidential
power.

 &HT;    ShortTakes: It's foreign policy, stupid
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   China has been working 50 years to get over its revolution, and
still hasn't figured out how. Bill Clinton, discovering the bracing
effect a little foreign policy has on presidential humor, zipped
off to beguile the Chinese into being nicer. A little free speech
here. A little less jail time there. The Chinese are cautious.
Students, journalists and artists alone can drive even the most
accommodating oligarch half off his or her rocker.
</P>
<P>
   It's all scripted. Clinton gets to lecture the Chinese on human
rights. The Chinese get to ignore him. Critics back home get to say
he hasn't done enough. The Chinese leadership will do what it cares
to keep the bucks flowing, insisting they won't be pushed around by
McDonald's and Coca-Cola. In the end, we'll gripe and sell them
whatever they'll buy. That's our nature.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing all that wrong with revolution; some serve good
purposes. It's the post-revolutionary period that's dangerous. We
held two, the American Revolution and the Civil War. The first
worked out. We haven't gotten over the second one. Mao, Stalin and
Hitler made careers out of proposing ever more radical upheavals.
Revolution is addictive.
</P>
<P>
   As you look around, you don't see much New World Order. You do
see a lot of countries in the revolutionary intensive care unit.
Our solution so far has been to kill a few people, then sell them
stuff. Or, when we're peeved, not sell them stuff.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: We're for big government, GOP declares
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way to hold down the crime rate is to stop passing laws
against stuff that isn't crooked. Congress is off on two such
toots.
</P>
<P>
   To cover their tails after killing comprehensive anti-smoking
legislation for the tobacco lobby, Republicans are proposing a bill
that would ticket youths caught smoking, take away their license to
drive if they have one and force them to do community service.
</P>
<P>
   The earlier bill pushed by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., would have
held the tobacco companies to costly account if they continued to
pitch children. McCain's GOP colleagues instead want to make kids
liable for falling for the companies' advertising. House Speaker
Newt Gingrich has declared the new approach just right. He would.
</P>
<P>
   And the House has passed legislation that would make it illegal
for an adult in a state that requires parental consent for an
abortion to accompany a girl to a non-consent state. Thus a short
drive across a state line would become a crime _ abetting a minor
in the commission of a lawful act!
</P>
<P>
   The bill is just one more hammer blow in the endless labor of
the Republican Party to build barriers to abortion until all that's
left is an unreachable right encased in impediments. And that is of
a piece with the accumulating assault on women's reproductive
rights in general.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are planning to keep federal health insurance from
covering contraceptives for government employees, and the House has
voted to forbid U.S. approval of RU-486 and similar, so-called
morning-after drugs. Thus are American women to be denied access
that is common in Europe to a safe, uninvasive means of early-term
abortion. (Incidentally assuring a contraband market and thus
_presto! _ still more crime.)
</P>
<P>
   All of this retrograde energy is by way of placating the
religious right, several of whose eminences have spoken sharply to
Republican leadership of late.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the GOP seems permanently stuck on the down side
of the gender gap _ a big reason it has been unable to nail the
durable majority that it believes it ought to have by rights. What
counts is that the Christian Coalition, James Dobson's Focus on the
Family and Gary Bauer's Family Research Council be kept in at least
sullen lockstep with GOP candidates.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the GOP curia, Pat Robertson, has announced that
the lightning and wildfires in Florida are God's punishment for
Disney treating gays and lesbians as it treats everyone else.
(Perhaps Robertson will in time explain just what sin the farmers
and ranchers of the Southwest committed to be visited, as they are,
by drought and a plague of grasshoppers.)
</P>
<P>
   It is dutifully, then, that the Senate leadership is blocking
approval of a qualified gay as ambassador to Luxembourg. (Actually,
who isn't qualified to be ambassador to Luxembourg?) What's a
little human sacrifice in the cause of intraparty amity?
</P>
<P>
   Has the silly season just come early this year? Is it becoming
permanent? Does El Nino twist human affairs as it does
meteorological ones?
</P>
<P>
   Or are we suffering the double whammy of an election year and
the incoming millennium? If so, 2000 doesn't even bear thinking
about.

 WAKING UP TO REALITY OF A TOOTHLESS IRS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June (The Week in Review)  
(duplication warning: also sent with `w' code) 
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After building a case that the IRS harasses and
intimidates taxpayers, Congress wrapped up work last week on a
bipartisan bill to rein in the agency. Taxpayers will get more
legal protections when they get into disputes with the IRS The
agency will now have to operate under the eye of an outside board,
and it will be prodded to undertake a reorganization intended to
make it more customer-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   There is almost no one in Congress who thinks any of this is a
bad idea, and President Clinton is eager to sign the bill, which
cleared the House 402-8 on Thursday and will come to Senate floor
early next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill will give every American a fighting chance when the
tax man comes a-knocking,'' said House Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Yet history suggests that a few years from now, Congress will be
holding another set of hearings, asking why the IRS is not doing a
better job of collecting all the tax revenue the government is
owed.
</P>
<P>
   Members of both parties will bemoan the increasing lack of
compliance and note that if the IRS could just collect a fraction
of the money lost to evasion, Congress could finance bigger tax
cuts or more preschool programs or another wing of fighter planes.
And few politicians will stop to ask whether Congress itself may
have gone too far in 1998 in defanging the IRS or in portraying the
tax-collection agency as populated by jack-booted thugs intent on
driving honest citizens to despair or worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a constant tension between effective tax
administration and the perception the public has of an overbearing
tax authority,'' said Gregory F. Jenner, a tax policy expert at the
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand financial services company in Washington. ``That
tension has existed since the dawn of time and we are now seeing
the pendulum swing toward one extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS has clearly mistreated some taxpayers, failed to provide
quick, accurate answers to people befuddled by their forms and
generally earned its standing as the most-loathed arm of the
government.
</P>
<P>
   But in bashing the IRS so relentlessly, Congress has created at
least the risk of aggravating other problems, not least public
faith in a system that relies largely on self-assessment and
voluntary compliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of negative publicity about tax enforcement can't
help but hurt collection efforts,'' said Joseph Thorndike, head of
the tax history project at Tax Analysts, a non-profit publishing
company. ``That might be a price worth paying if there are in fact
serious problems within their collection activities. But it won't
be cost free.''
</P>
<P>
   One way to measure the cost is the $13 billion price tag
attached to the bill by Congress, much of which is money that won't
be collected as a result of the new protections granted to
taxpayers. Divorced or separated people who claim ignorance of tax
evasion by their former spouses, for example, will win protections
that the bill values at $1.6 billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said it is wrong to think of the revenue as lost,
since by the bill's definition the government would no longer have
any claim on it. Still, some provisions could, as a White House
analysis put it, ``unintentionally make it easier for noncompliant
taxpayers to avoid paying their fair share of taxes.'' And tax
evasion is already a huge problem.
</P>
<P>
   IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti told the Senate Finance
Committee last month that the tax ``gap'' _ the difference between
the revenue actually collected by the federal government and what
Washington figures the actual total tax bill should be _ is running
at about $195 billion a year. That is about 11.5 percent of the
expected $1.7 trillion federal budget next year and roughly double
the last estimate, in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   During much of the 1980s, closing the tax gap was a much bigger
issue than IRS excesses. Democrats called the Reagan administration
to task for slashing too deeply into the IRS budget, and wanted
more effort expended on making sure the rich could not so easily
use both legal and illegal tax dodges. Republicans and Democrats
alike saw tightening up on tax collection as a politically easy way
to mitigate the pain of ever-mounting budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   For some years now, the pendulum has been swinging back toward
taxpayer protection. Under pressure from Congress, the IRS dropped
a program under which it randomly selected a cross-section of
taxpayers and subjected them to intense audits as a way of getting
a handle on how much cheating was going on.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the swing is the improvement in the government's
finances, which has removed the pressure to scrounge for new
revenue. Another is the ascendancy in Congress of the Republicans,
some of whom see attacking the IRS as a way of softening up public
opinion for the bigger goal of overhauling the tax system. But the
biggest reason may be that in the absence of any compelling reason
to do otherwise, members of Congress are going to heed the
complaints of their constituents. And few subjects bring so many
complaints as taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem with the tax system,'' said Sheldon Cohen,
who was IRS commissioner during the late 1960s, ``is that Congress
responds to a sad story.''

 CHURCH, STATE AND SCHOOL: HOLES IN THE WALL OF SEPRATION
</HEADLINE>
 
 (Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, June(The Week in Review) 
(bl) 
By ETHAN BRONNER  
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a substitute teacher in a New York City public school led
11-year-old pupils in prayer and asked them to accept Jesus Christ
as their savior, the Board of Education dismissed her this month.
In the words of the board's spokeswoman, the teacher ``had very
clearly crossed the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Who could argue? If the separation of church and state mandated
by the First Amendment means anything, surely it bars state-paid
teachers from evangelizing to public schoolchildren in
state-provided classrooms during school hours.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the fired teacher, Mildred Rosario, has become a minor hero
to some. Parents, New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and even the
Republican congressional leadership have complained that, at a time
when public schools are littered with needles and condoms, to fire
a teacher for leading prayers is incomprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   The episode is an apt reminder that 36 years after the Supreme
Court banned school prayer, there is no consensus on the
appropriate links between government and religion, particularly
within the school system.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Ms. Rosario's prayer, another storm over church,
state and schoolhouse erupted after a decision by the Wisconsin
Supreme Court. It ruled that Milwaukee could spend taxpayer money
to send pupils to religious schools through a voucher system.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties advocates and teacher unions expressed shock
that the court would permit state financing of institutions devoted
to religious teaching.
</P>
<P>
   But government aid to religious instruction has existed
throughout U.S. history. Through most of the 19th century, public
schools routinely taught the Bible. And even in this century, when
the wall of separation became commonly invoked, religious schoools
have received substantial state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1947, when the Supreme Court permitted New Jersey to
reimburse parochial school parents for the use of public school
buses, large amounts of government money have gone to
church-sponsored institutions. Not only are church properties
tax-exempt _ no small matter in places like Manhattan _ but
parochial school parents in some states get tax breaks for tuition,
and the equivalent of public vouchers are widely used in church
preschools and colleges. Churches and their schools have, of
course, always benefitted from state-financed police and fire
protection.
</P>
<P>
   The devil has been in the details.
</P>
<P>
   Parochial schools may use state-provided buses for
transportation to classes but not for field trips; state-paid
nurses may work at the schools but state-paid guidance counselors
may not; the state may lend parochial schools textbooks but not
audio-visual aids or maps (a distinction that led Sen. Daniel
Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., to quip that the next big challenge would
be atlases, which are books of maps). For years, public remedial
teachers could serve parochial students only in trailers, a
decision that the High Court reversed last year, thereby permitting
the state teachers to enter the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Religious display rulings have been even more tortured. A city
may erect a creche at Christmas or a menorah at Hanukkah on
condition that it is surrounded by enough other seasonal symbols,
like reindeer or plastic candy canes, to blunt its religious
message.
</P>
<P>
   As bizarre as some of these distinctions may sound, they emerged
from numerous cases over half a century. Most rulings came from
divided courts and each established a slightly different set of
criteria for interpreting the First Amendment's command that
``Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of
religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the founders' history _ they were running from regimes
that imposed religion _ it is no accident that religious freedom
leads the list of rights Congress is forbidden to abridge, or that
on its heels come speech and assembly. But the three form a nexus
of individual liberty that is exceedingly difficult to disentangle.
Shifting criteria reflect shifting legal and political climates as
well as shifting Supreme Court personnel.
</P>
<P>
   For example, it was Justice Hugo Black who wrote the 5-4 opinion
in 1947 permitting New Jersey to reimburse parents for sending
their children to parochial schools on public transportation. He
said the First Amendment ``requires the state to be neutral in its
relations with groups of religious believers and nonbelievers.'' He
added: ``It does not require the state to be their adversary. State
power is no more to be used so as to handicap religions, than it is
to favor them.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, in a case from New York state, Justice Byron
White wrote a 6-3 decision permitting the state to lend textbooks
to parochial schools, saying the books were secular and would not
be used for religious instruction. But Black, whose broad
interpretation of the First Amendment had helped White craft that
decision, dissented, saying there was a distinction between aid for
things like transportation and lunch, which were nonsubstantive,
and textbooks, which could be related to religious views.
</P>
<P>
   And even though textbook loans were permitted, a decision in the
1970s barred the lending of instructional materials, including
maps, to parochial schools ``because of the predominantly religious
character of the schools.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the court barred public school teachers from performing
remedial work in parochial schools. Among the dissenters was
Associate Justice William H. Rehnquist, the future chief justice,
who was instrumental in the 1997 ruling overturning that decision.
</P>
<P>
   The back-and-forth on these questions suggests that if the
Wisconsin voucher decision is accepted for review by the Supreme
Court, something both sides say they want, the chances of a clear
ruling seem small. Four other states have similar cases pending and
voucher systems are rapidly spreading across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the fear that such programs would denude the public
schools of motivated pupils and much-needed cash, the concern of
those opposed to the voucher program has been that if government is
seen to endorse one religion, that religion has an unfair advantage
over others.
</P>
<P>
   The founders actually banned government endorsement largely for
a different reason. They feared state involvement would sully
religion, not help it.
</P>
<P>
   Black relied on that view when he wrote that the First Amendment
``rested on the belief that a union of government and religion
tends to destroy government and to degrade religion.'' He added
that the history of established religion ``showed that many people
lost their respect for any religion that had relied upon the
support of government to spread its faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for a lowered wall of separation invoke the founders
frequently, saying they never planned for government to be a force
for atheism. That is true, but the founders insisted on religious
freedom, mindful of something else: the danger of sectarian battle.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that there appears little risk of a return to the
religious wars of an earlier era. But a contemporary version _ a
battle between religious and secular forces for control of public
and educational life _ does not seem out of the question.

   AIDS Now Rivals Historic Epidemics
</P>
<P>
   AIDS has spread so widely around the world that it now compares
with the great epidemics of history, the United Nations reported.
In parts of Africa, one in four adults is infected with the AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 30 million people were infected with the virus, HIV,
and 21 million of them were in Africa, according to the United
Nations report, the first to provide a country-by-country analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The report paints the gloomiest pictures of the HIV epidemic
since it was first recognized in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Death of the Middle Ages killed 20 million people in
four years and the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919, after World War
I, killed 20 million.
</P>
<P>
   High Court Broadens Grounds For Harassment Suits
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled that an employee who resists a
supervisor's advances can pursue a sexual harassment lawsuit even
if he or she suffered no career setbacks because of the harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But such a lawsuit cannot succeed, the court said, if the
company has an anti-harassment policy with an effective complaint
procedure and the employee has unreasonably failed to use it.
</P>
<P>
   In a 7-to-2 decision, the court said Kimberly Ellerth, of
Belvidere, Ill., should have an opportunity to prove to a court
that her former employer, Burlington Industries, violated her civil
rights even though she was neither fired nor demoted. Ms. Ellerth
quit her job about two months after she was recommended for a
promotion.

   Court Calls HIV a Disability, And Rules on Arts Grants  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The court also ruled that people with HIV infections need not
have any symptoms of disease or obvious impairment in order to be
covered by the federal law that bars discrimination on the basis of
disability. It was a major victory for people with the virus that
causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Voting 5-4, the justices agreed with a federal appeals court's
ruling that a woman with asymptomatic HIV infection, who was
refused care in a dentist's office, met the definition of
disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   In a case involving the National Endowment for the Arts, the
court upheld a congressional decency test for awarding grants, but
only after a majority interpreted a 1990 law as containing only
``advisory language'' that did not actually prohibit subsidies for
indecent art. In fact, the court strongly suggested that the law
could violate the First Amendment.

   White House Renews Contract Preferences
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Supreme Court held that many of the
government's programs granting preferences based on race or sex
were unconstitutional. The Clinton administration began searching
for an approach that retained affirmative action in government
contracts while satisfying constitutional requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Now the White House has come up with a new policy.
Minority-owned businesses will be given an advantage in bidding in
industries like trucking where statistical surveys show they are
underrepresented. But in industries like food processing where they
seem to be getting a fair share, there will be no affirmative
action.

   Nine months after Ms. Molinari, the former congresswoman from
New York, began a new career as co-host of ``CBS News Saturday
Morning,'' she and CBS News have split.
</P>
<P>
   Her side says CBS _ leery of criticism that a neutral news
program would become a forum for a partisan politician _ tried to
steer the cheery Republican into home-and-garden chat and away from
important issues. CBS News president Andrew Heyward said she would

wreckage of the failed launching of a U.S. satellite in China in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon insists the loss of the encoded chip, which tells
an orbiting satellite which way to point, would have minimal impact
on national security.
</P>
<P>
   But government officials could not say whether China has ever
given an accounting of the missing circuit board.

   _ By ERIC SCHMITT
</P>
<P>
   Hey! I'm Trying to Sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Try, if you can, to recall the olden days of train travel.
Passengers read or slept, laughed or wept, conversed softly,
perhaps wrote novels. They may have yearned to call home or office,
but, they survived.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the cell phone, and a simple trip became a minefield of
little emergencies. The train's late, the dinner's cold, the
meeting's canceled, Junior has the flu. On New York's Metro-North
recently, a man engaged in oh-so-solemn discussion of the evening's
wine choice.
</P>
<P>
   And for some reason that modern science has yet to fathom,
callers send these vital bulletins in booming, resonant tones.
</P>
<P>
   Now some riders, understandably, balk at having their cocoon
invaded. A group called the Long Island Rail Road Commuters Council
has started a campaign to promote greater courtesy, featuring a
contest for cartoons or slogans to make the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be viewed as disciplinarians,'' said Larry
Silverman, the council's chairman. ``Often it's not a lack of
courtesy so much as a lack of awareness'' _ awareness that you
don't have to yell into the things. Whatever it is, it's a growing
nuisance; the council said cell-phone abuse was a top complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the answer is a modern-day echo of the no-smoking car:
the no-phone car. Just as you used to pass from clear air to
choking haze, now you could go from a sea of serene readers into a
cacophony of ``Sell 300 shares!'' ``The '92 cabernet, of course!''
and ``The kids did what??!!''

   Taking a Stand for the Ultra-Rich
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer has used his influence as chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee to preserve an inheritance tax break for a
few wealthy people that no one, not even Archer, intended to be in
the law in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   He makes no apologies. ``Death taxes,'' says Archer, a Texas
Republican who represents one of the country's wealthiest
districts, are confiscatory and unfair. Just because a tax cut got
on the books accidentally is no reason to get rid of it.
</P>
<P>
   The word in Republican circles is that Archer was encouraged,
perhaps instructed, to take his stand by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, another opponent of estate taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The only beneficiaries of the mistake are the heirs of a few
hundred people who die each year and leave estates worth more than
$17 million. Each of those estates will be spared more than
$200,000 in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to the government in lost revenue: $880 million over
the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The tax break resulted from an error by someone on Congress'
technical staff in the drafting of last year's balanced-budget and
tax-cut law. Drafting mistakes are commonplace in big, complicated
tax bills. When they are caught, they are normally corrected in the
next tax bill without much opposition.
</P>
<P>
   That is what everyone expected to happen this time. But Archer
blocked the correction. Since no one felt as strongly about fixing
the error as he felt about leaving it uncorrected, a few rich
families are even richer.

understand human speech and translate more languages than a platoon

   CONSUMER-WATCH30 _ The federal Cooling-Off Rule, passed by
Congress in 1972 to protect vulnerable consumers from unscrupulous
door-to-door salespeople, is one of the nation's best consumer

often causes problems. Rarely a week passes that we don't receive
calls from readers who say they have purchased some item, usually a
car, and they want to return it. ``Don't I have three days to
change my mind?'' they ask. Usually the answer is no _ and nearly
always no with the purchase of a car, unless the seller agreed to a
return period. (Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f, l)

   THARPE-COLUMN30 _ Fraudulent credit card offers are the kudzu
vine of consumer cons. They keep coming back, despite constant
efforts to eradicate them. Kudzu will thrive almost anywhere where
there's a little bit of dirt. Fraudulent cards thrive on the need
for credit _ and consumers who have difficulty obtaining credit are
prime targets for the bogus offers. (Tharpe, Atlanta

</P>
<P>
   It could be VHS against Betamax. Or compact discs against vinyl.
Fax vs. e-mail, vs. the Postal Service. Among wireless phones, it
could be traditional cellular against personal communications

there is a coming battle between phone lines called Asymmetric
Digital Subscriber Lines, known as ADSL, and cable modems running
over cable lines. And for them to succeed, they must both overcome
the slower but more entrenched modems. The formats clash. Sometimes
one dies, and sometimes they coexist. (Kanell, Atlanta

 &HT;    Commentary: Airlines always keep an eye on their bottom line
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Airline executives respond to questions about
government regulation the way the Scarecrow gave directions to
Dorothy after she landed in Oz. They point in two opposite
directions at once.
</P>
<P>
   When airline honchos think regulations might help consumers,
they point vigorously toward libertarianism. But if the regulations
help their profits, they point toward legislation.
</P>
<P>
   This month, industry leaders displayed their schizophrenic
tendencies while trying to influence Congress. Their libertarian
side came out as they fiercely lobbied the House Transportation
Committee to kill government guidelines to curb predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, proposed in April by Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater, would allow the government to levy fines whenever it
finds a major airline trying to snuff out a small carrier by
flooding the market with cheap seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years since airlines were deregulated, the government
has not been involved in determining fares. But Slater said his
department needs the power to stop big airlines from ``dumping''
unfairly priced seats.
</P>
<P>
   But his proposal got the major carriers complaining that the
guidelines would limit their pricing flexibility and be a step
toward re-regulation. Republican leaders agreed and last week
pushed the House Transportation Committee to delay implementation
of the guidelines for months while the matter is studied by the
National Academy of Sciences' Transportation Research Board.
</P>
<P>
   The major carriers' anti-DOT position was in keeping with a
grand pronouncement made by Carol Hallett, president of the Air
Transport Association, the industry's trade group. Last year, in an
address to hundreds of Wall Street analysts, Hallett attacked
regulations, saying, ``Everywhere we turn, we face the government's
heavy hand.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if the major airlines could get that heavy hand to help
them with the luggage? Well that's another matter.
</P>
<P>
   This month Delta Air Lines testified before the House Aviation
Subcommittee, urging Congress to pass the ``Carry-On Baggage
Reduction Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Congress be in the business of telling individuals how
big their purses can be or whether a diaper bag is baggage?
</P>
<P>
   Yes sir, according to Delta. But why is this a job for
government? The Atlanta-based carrier already has instituted a
two-bag limit to prevent travelers from hauling on board their
steamer trunks. The policy is a good one: Overstuffed bins are
dangerous and they slow the boarding process.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Delta's less-prosperous competitors don't have such
tough carry-on policies. They have emptier planes and therefore
more room in their overhead bins. On slow days, they might allow a
business traveler to hop onto a plane with a garment bag, a
carry-on suitcase and a laptop computer and a purse.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way a free market is supposed to work: Each carrier
does what it can to attract customers. Delta, which has problems
with flight delays, needs a strict carry-on rule to speed up
boarding. Small carriers, which have fewer occupied seats, may need
a relaxed carry-on rule to please customers.
</P>
<P>
   But why face competition when you can get government to
eliminate the pressure for you? If Congress were to pass the
``Carry-On Baggage Reduction Act,'' then small airlines would lose
an advantage they have over big ones.
</P>
<P>
   The major airlines may seem confused about government's role in
their industry, but their position actually is quite consistent:
Any regulation that protects consumers is a violation of the free
market, and any regulation that protects them from start-up
carriers is good public policy.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Much ado about nothing most of the time
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Here and there in the news with occasional
commentary, and a story of my own:
</P>
<P>
   ``I read, therefore I am amused ... and occasionally dismayed.''
_ Socrates (loose translation because I don't read Greek).
</P>
<P>
   Disclaimer: The following material contains nothing of political
or social significance and carries a rating of GG (Good Grief!).
</P>
<P>
   Local newspaper: Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan when asked if
Pakistan had carried out additional nuclear tests: ``Yes, by the
grace of God.''
</P>
<P>
   God is in the bomb business?
</P>
<P>
   West Coast reader: ``It used to be called brainwashing'; now it
has a different name _ rap.' ''
</P>
<P>
   East Coast reader: ``My 11-year-old came home from school with
this joke. He thought it was hilarious:
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``What do you do when your mother staggers out onto
the porch?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``Shoot her again.''
</P>
<P>
   This is humor?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but only to the generation who will be running the country
in our Social Security years.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspaper headline: Mooning threatens Navy officer's
career. ``A would-be career officer with a Ph.D. could be dismissed
from the Navy because he mooned a buddy while jogging at the
Pensacola Naval Air Station.'' The lieutenant, an aerospace
physiology instructor, was ordered to undergo two psychological
evaluations and was charged with indecent exposure and conduct
unbecoming an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Can't help wondering: If he'd done it in a bar, would that have
come under the heading of acceptable military behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Psychological evaluations? Because a guy bared his butt? Come
on, Navy, he's probably getting ready to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Story time: Year _ 1981. Place _ sidelines of a soccer field at
a small, private school in west Georgia. The team (coed) is at
practice; my son is goalie. The headmistress and I sit in the shade
and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a county school bus rolls by on the road above the field.
Kids hang out the windows yelling insults at our players,
questioning their sexual orientation because they have girls on the
team. This has been happening daily for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, same place: ``Look at Denise run!'' the headmistress
cheers as a gangly girl of 13 charges down the field, controlling
the ball the whole way. ``You know,'' she exults, ``we just might
win that game tomorrow.'' We exchange odds on the possibility, and
then the conversation wanders away from the playing field and onto
other things. Suddenly, we notice the quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are all of the boys up on that hill next to the road? What
is that they're doing?'' she asks, squinting at the distance.
``Where are the girls?'' Seconds later, we spot the three girls
behind a big old tree, out of sight of the road. ``What's going
on?'' a now highly suspicious headmistress asks.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is just rounding the bend in the road. As the big
yellow school bus comes alongside our practice field with heads
hanging from every window yelling insults, the entire Oak Mountain
Academy soccer team bares their butts in a perfectly orchestrated
response to the abuse they have been enduring for days.
</P>
<P>
   The headmistress gasps. The girls behind the tree gape. I
giggle. The boys are too far away from all of us for any details to
be noticed. In other words, we can't see much, but the county bus
is getting an eyeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God!'' the headmistress chokes out, ``did you see
that?''
</P>
<P>
   I raise my eyebrows, widen my eyes and answer: ``See what?''
</P>
<P>
   She turns, studies my fibbing face for a moment, and tests the
waters. ``Quite right. Yes, of course. We saw nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of seconds, the girls are out from behind the tree
and everyone is back on the practice field hard at work, kicking,
defending, and glancing our way to see what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   After a few moments of thought, in an aside, the headmistress
says to me, ``They handled the timing rather well, don't you
think?'' I assure her it was the most efficiently choreographed
mass mooning I had ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   End of discussion. It became a non-event.
</P>
<P>
   As is 90 percent of the daily news.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: My China, my mother and me
 &HT;    By Liu Xin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   XIAN, China _ I am home. From the descending airplane I can see
the loess-covered landscape of the Yellow Earth Plateau, winding up
and down. As we approach, I see the city wall and moat, ringing
Xi'an in brick and water.
</P>
<P>
   In many of my homesick dreams in the States, Xi'an stayed as
still and as solid as the thousand-year-old stone city wall.
</P>
<P>
   But I would return to find a much different Xi'an, just as Xi'an
would find a much different me.
</P>
<P>
   I land in Xi'an on a steaming, hazy June afternoon. Within
minutes, I am surrounded by tour guides, hotel receptionists and
taxi drivers waiting to solicit the arriving tourists.
</P>
<P>
   I am also surrounded by silk: silk blouses, silk pants, silk
dresses, some colorful, some patterned. They are wrinkled, sopping
wet, sticking to the bodies of men and women busy talking on
cellular phones or waiting for departures or arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   I wave to the city tower as the taxi drifts among the cars,
motorcycles and bicycles. Women pedal by, steering with one hand,
clutching a corner of their skirts in the other, saving their
dresses from the turning wheels. Their shoulders and arms are
covered with silk scarves, protecting their fair skin from the
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's very trendy this year,'' the taxi driver says, nodding
at the silk scarves fluttering by, making beautiful waves in the
hot summer sun.
</P>
<P>
   As I drag myself _ in soaking cotton shirt and shorts _ out of
the taxi, I see my mother and brother looking at me, hesitating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that you?'' my mother asks, reaching her arms out. ``You
are so dark.''
</P>
<P>
   Fair skin is very important to women in China. I was very fair
when I left home several years ago. It took me almost a year to get
a nice tan after I moved to Florida to work for The Palm Beach
Post.
</P>
<P>
   I don't defend myself this time. After 31 hours on a sleepless
journey from West Palm Beach, Fla. to Los Angeles to Tokyo to
Beijing, I only want to rest.
</P>
<P>
   The sun rises over the city wall, the cold gray stones standing
against the misty sky like a huge backdrop.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp, high female voice blares from speakers, counting from
one to four in Mandarin: ``yi, er, san, si.''
</P>
<P>
   I am watching morning exercises in the park outside the wall,
where men and women gather in front of an instructor who commands
them to bend, twist and stretch in unison. Nearby, others sway,
turn and push into the air in slow motion, working through tai chi.
Some inhale deeply and tighten their muscles as they practiced kung
fu. A few thrust swords into the air while others play badminton
across nets suspended between trees.
</P>
<P>
   Across the moat, packed buses lurch along the streets and black,
chunky, unstylish bikes mix with trendy newer models. I notice that
Fei Ge _ Flying Pigeon brand bicycles _ are not the status symbols
they were a decade ago. These days, Raleighs dominate the market.
</P>
<P>
   On a red Yong Jiu (``Forever'') brand bike, with my camera bag
placed in the basket in the front and my pony-tail loosely bound, I
look more traditionally Chinese than most of the young women on the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   They wear brightly colored short skirts and tights, even making
a tentative effort at applying make-up, trying foreign lipsticks
and eye-shadows. Some have their hair permed in the latest styles;
a few even have reddish hair. This would have been unthinkable in
the Xi'an I knew.
</P>
<P>
   But so much is new in Xi'an: Outside the city walls, a high
technology zone sprawls into countless tall apartment buildings,
each with personal satellite dishes gathered on top. Highway
bridges snake this way and that.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the walls, fancy stores have opened, some with imported
shiny Italian leather shoes and fashionable French silk dresses.
Mercedes-Benzes and Cadillacs navigate through the traffic. Miller
Lite sells in bars. McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Marlboro cigarettes are
popular.
</P>
<P>
   Designer goods are snapped up by cash-rich Chinese. It didn't
take me long to figure out that it cost only two dollars to buy a
Calvin Klein T-shirt on the street in Xi'an, while in the States
they cost $12. I wish I had known that when I spent all of that
money buying CK shirts as gifts for friends in China.
</P>
<P>
   But more than tangibles have changed. MTV brought Mary Chapin
Carpenter's Passionate Kisses to Chinese teens as soon as their
American counterparts heard it. Politics, once a national
obsession, no longer holds young people's interest. Instead, it is
money. I found out two of my best friends from high school had
become roly-poly millionaires among the hundreds of thousands of
young nouveau riche throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   While the T-shirts may have failed to impress my family and
friends, something quite unexpected caught their interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa, look at this!'' my mother says, staring at the plastic
bag I kept my film in to avoid airport X-ray checks. ``Look at the
colors, one side yellow, one side blue, and when it is fully
zipped, it turns green!'' Her mouth and eyes are wide, as if she
were Columbus spotting the New World. It was a gallon-size Ziploc
freezer bag I got from the Publix supermarket on Southern Boulevard
in West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Days after that, whenever we had visitors at home, she would go
to the kitchen to get the bag and explain patiently how the color
changed. Everyone tried their hand at ``the color trick'' over and
over again. ``How smart the Americans are!'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   When I grew up, there was a saying: Even the moon is rounder in
America. Foreign products in the ``Friendship Store'' downtown were
sold only to foreigners. And outside the American embassy, there
was always a line of young people anxious to leave their motherland
for American dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, the tinted windows of the old Friendship Store have
been replaced with bright, transparent glass. ``Everybody
welcome,'' a sign says.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody with money.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get rich is glorious,'' Deng Xiaoping announced in 1978.
And the people responded.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in purchasing power has resulted in a phenomenon called
the ``three hot buys'' - san da jian.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s and 1970s, the three items a Chinese family
desired were bicycles, watches and radios. In the 1980s, households
saved to buy color televisions, refrigerators and washing machines.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1990s, all these had become passe. The China Daily
speculated on the three hot buys for the 1990s in 1993 _ some
people said cars, houses and telephones _ but, the paper reported,
the Chinese had yet to reach consensus on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the hot item on the market for family entertainment
is the VCD, a combination VCR and CD player.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my mother and I stood with a crowd of men in the
electronics department of a giant local department store, examining
more than a dozen brands of VCD machines. Colorful banners hung all
over the store: Bloody Sale! Suicide Sale! On the Chinese market,
trends come and go quickly. Retailers often sacrifice some profit
to make a sale.
</P>
<P>
   After the persistent salesman promised to give us a free
``virtual pet'' bonus, my mother took out her wallet to buy a VCD.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Tamagotchi, the egg-sized computer critters that beep
at all hours to be fed, cleaned, amused and educated, are so hot
they are constantly out of stock. My 21-year-old sister had been
looking for one for a week. I was not sure whether my mother was
more interested in the VCD or the digital pet.
</P>
<P>
   My mother pulled out a bright red plastic card from her wallet
and extended it to my nose. ``Have you ever seen this?'' she asked,
giggling. ``It's an xin yong ka. You can take money out of the
machine in the giant stores just like this.'' She shrugged her
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   An ATM card. She was showing me an ATM card.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dan wei started direct deposit this year,'' she said,
smiling proudly. ``Do you Americans have this?''
</P>
<P>
   I laughed. Not because of the card or her question. She was
calling me an American.
</P>
<P>
   So the Xi'an I'd returned to had changed.
</P>
<P>
   But during my stay, I found comforting constants: the smell of
garlic and charcoal barbecue, the laughter and conversations
outside small restaurants, men and women strolling leisurely down
the street with fans in their hands. The bird market, banned during
the Cultural Revolution, had returned, with colorful parrots
greeting me in Mandarin _ ``Gong Xi Fa Cai,'' congratulations for
making good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   My mother cooked all of my favorite foods, feeding me zong zi
(glutinous rice and dates wrapped in a bamboo leaf), jiao zi (meat
dumplings) and various stir fries. As much as I complained about
putting on weight, I'd stuff myself at every meal.
</P>
<P>
   And at night people brought out stools and fans and met up with
friends under the city wall, where they chatted and joked, while
the moon's reflection twisted in the moats.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, my mother is scrubbing to prepare for dinner. A
woman is singing on the VCD in her deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   Love is a lock,
</P>
<P>
   I could never find the key.
</P>
<P>
   It is the end of July and I am preparing for my trip back to the
United States. My mother has helped me pack, but she has been
quiet. Several times I think she wants to tell me something
important.
</P>
<P>
   I know my mother is proud of me. She's kept my articles and
photographs from newspapers and magazines even though she worries
about my carrying more than 30 pounds of photo equipment and going
to strange places, meeting strangers every day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I had told her I wanted to be a traveling photojournalist.
I could sense she knew what this would entail; we would see each
even less than we have been; infrequently, at best.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up the oldest of three children, yet my mother and I
never had a heart-to-heart conversation. A famous regional folk and
opera singer, her experience of being sent to the countryside to
work during the Cultural Revolution scared her so much she made me
stop my piano lessons when I was 6. She changed her career for good
_ working as an office manager at a construction company _ soon
after she divorced my father, whom she met at age 18. She stopped
singing.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce was very rare in China then. I worked hard to keep the
highest grades at school so that my teachers and classmates
wouldn't point at me and spread gossip about my family.
</P>
<P>
   Love is a lock,
</P>
<P>
   why do you keep me waiting.
</P>
<P>
   On the VCD, the woman is singing in her twanging voice.
</P>
<P>
   I open the door to the small kitchen and heat rushes out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you OK, Ma? Can I help you with anything?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   On the cutting board, colorful ingredients are spread out like a
beautiful garden: finely cut tomatoes, green peppers, black
mushooms, soft tofu, bamboo shoots, dried yellow flowers and
chopped ham. My mother is making my favorite dish: hot and sour
soup.
</P>
<P>
   Water has started boiling in the pot. I help my mother add the
colorful ingredients. Steam rises between us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to divorce your stepfather,'' she says calmly,
tears welling in her eyes. ``I decided to tell you this before you
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   I am stunned, speechless. I'd never thought she would leave my
stepfather. I knew she wasn't happy with her life after she married
him 18 years ago. He was a nice person but could never figure out
why my mother was unhappy with her comfortable secretary's job, or
why she would get mad at him for turning up the radio to listen to
those boring officially permitted operas, which had ruined her
first career.
</P>
<P>
   Many times in the past, she wanted to get a divorce. ``You can't
divorce again!'' her friends and my grandmother would gossip. ``One
woman divorces two husbands _ what would people think?!''
</P>
<P>
   I never imagined that my mother, who had swallowed the
traditional moral and social values - and her passions - all her
life, would spew them out at age 53.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why this time, Ma?'' I ask through the steam. The ingredients
swirl in the boiling water as colorful as a kaleidoscope. The girl
on the VCD finally finishes her love song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was so quiet in the past several years,'' she says, ``and
I started to think about my own life. I realized what big mistakes
I'd made. I could have given you, your sister and brother a better
family life if I had been stronger. I blame myself all the time and
always think that you might hate me and that's why you stay so far
away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   The soup is steaming between us, distancing my mother from me,
blurring her face, and then pulling us together by circling around
us. Suddenly, I feel that I want to tell her many things that I've
never told her simply because I was not used to sharing my thoughts
with her.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never told her that the more I learned from life without
her, the closer I felt to her.
</P>
<P>
   I choke back sobs as I tell her how my cameras have taken me to
such places! Through tiny towns of Florida and to smoky cigar bars
in Havana. I could cover the news without waiting for the
Propaganda Department to tell me what to think. I'd lived in six
cities and worked for five American newspapers, even taking a
two-month solo camping trip through the States.
</P>
<P>
   I tell her how much joy and freedom I derive from my new
experiences: so much so that I now have enough confidence to go
around the world and work. I tell her that I had been afraid to
share these feelings with her because she always wanted me to
settle down.
</P>
<P>
   But wherever I go, I tell her, I owe who I am to her: Really,
she had taught me everything, about love, and, indirectly, about
following the heart and its passions. And because my siblings and I
had left her for the world, she finally had the chance to listen to
her own heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine and I are thinking about starting our own
choir group,'' my mother says. A big smile lights up her face. ``I
have not sung a complete song for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, we are conversing as two women. We may never
have been a perfect mother and daughter. But mothers and daughters
don't have to be perfect. For the first time, we are laughing as
two friends who had been apart for years, only to be reunited in my
mother's kitchen in Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
   My mother slowly drops in the sesame oil as a finishing touch.
We eat our soup like a communion.
</P>
<P>
   It is hot and spicy, just as I like it, and I know I will miss
it wherever my life takes me next.
</P>
<P>
   As the taxi takes me out the city gate on my way to the airport,
a funeral procession - beating drums and gongs - makes its way
slowly through the empty fields. People in white shrouds - white is
the Chinese color of mourning - carry round, colorful paper
wreaths, like archery targets.
</P>
<P>
   I think about my grandma, who is 90 this year.
</P>
<P>
   My grandma is among the last generation of Chinese woman who has
3-inch bound feet, once called ``lotus petals.'' Her toes curve
around the sole of the foot until they touch the heel. She walks
stiff-legged and sway-hipped. I always found excuses to avoid
walking with her on the street when she visited my family. She
would tease my size seven feet in return: ``Who dare to marry a
girl with big feet like you?''
</P>
<P>
   I said my feet would take me around the world.
</P>
<P>
   I look back to the city. The tall city wall is disappearing in
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   From far away in the taxi, I see the paper wreath burn and the
smoke soar to the sky. Wind carries along the ash and dust and good
wishes from the mourners, swirling in the air above the land where
ancient emperors were buried with a piece of jade placed in their
mouths.
</P>
<P>
   In the silence, an ancient poem plays its notes in my heart:
</P>
<P>
   Endless is my longing _ longing for Chang'an (Xi'an).
</P>
<P>
   High is heaven, wide is earth;
</P>
<P>
   Neither can my spirit fly,
</P>
<P>
   Nor my dreams carry me over the firm mountain pass.
</P>
<P>
   Long is the longing that crushes my heart.

<P>
   In early 1990s, all these had become passe. The China Daily
speculated on the three hot buys for the 1990s in 1993 _ some
people said cars, houses and telephones _ but, the paper reported,
the Chinese had yet to reach consensus on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the hot item on the market for family entertainment
is the VCD, a combination VCR and CD player.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my mother and I stood with a crowd of men in the
electronics department of a giant local department store, examining
more than a dozen brands of VCD machines. Colorful banners hung all
over the store: Bloody Sale! Suicide Sale! On the Chinese market,
trends come and go quickly. Retailers often sacrifice some profit
to make a sale.
</P>
<P>
   After the persistent salesman promised to give us a free
``virtual pet'' bonus, my mother took out her wallet to buy a VCD.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese Tamagotchi, the egg-sized computer critters that beep
at all hours to be fed, cleaned, amused and educated, are so hot
they are constantly out of stock. My 21-year-old sister had been
looking for one for a week. I was not sure whether my mother was
more interested in the VCD or the digital pet.
</P>
<P>
   My mother pulled out a bright red plastic card from her wallet
and extended it to my nose. ``Have you ever seen this?'' she asked,
giggling. ``It's an xin yong ka. You can take money out of the
machine in the giant stores just like this.'' She shrugged her
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   An ATM card. She was showing me an ATM card.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dan wei started direct deposit this year,'' she said,
smiling proudly. ``Do you Americans have this?''
</P>
<P>
   I laughed. Not because of the card or her question. She was
calling me an American.
</P>
<P>
   So the Xi'an I'd returned to had changed.
</P>
<P>
   But during my stay, I found comforting constants: the smell of
garlic and charcoal barbecue, the laughter and conversations
outside small restaurants, men and women strolling leisurely down
the street with fans in their hands. The bird market, banned during
the Cultural Revolution, had returned, with colorful parrots
greeting me in Mandarin _ ``Gong Xi Fa Cai,'' congratulations for
making good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   My mother cooked all of my favorite foods, feeding me zong zi
(glutinous rice and dates wrapped in a bamboo leaf), jiao zi (meat
dumplings) and various stir fries. As much as I complained about
putting on weight, I'd stuff myself at every meal.
</P>
<P>
   And at night people brought out stools and fans and met up with
friends under the city wall, where they chatted and joked, while
the moon's reflection twisted in the moats.
</P>
<P>
   In the kitchen, my mother is scrubbing to prepare for dinner. A
woman is singing on the VCD in her deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   Love is a lock,
</P>
<P>
   I could never find the key.
</P>
<P>
   It is the end of July and I am preparing for my trip back to the
United States. My mother has helped me pack, but she has been
quiet. Several times I think she wants to tell me something
important.
</P>
<P>
   I know my mother is proud of me. She's kept my articles and
photographs from newspapers and magazines even though she worries
about my carrying more than 30 pounds of photo equipment and going
to strange places, meeting strangers every day.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I had told her I wanted to be a traveling photojournalist.
I could sense she knew what this would entail; we would see each
even less than we have been; infrequently, at best.
</P>
<P>
   I grew up the oldest of three children, yet my mother and I
never had a heart-to-heart conversation. A famous regional folk and
opera singer, her experience of being sent to the countryside to
work during the Cultural Revolution scared her so much she made me
stop my piano lessons when I was 6. She changed her career for good
_ working as an office manager at a construction company _ soon
after she divorced my father, whom she met at age 18. She stopped
singing.
</P>
<P>
   Divorce was very rare in China then. I worked hard to keep the
highest grades at school so that my teachers and classmates
wouldn't point at me and spread gossip about my family.
</P>
<P>
   Love is a lock,
</P>
<P>
   why do you keep me waiting.
</P>
<P>
   On the VCD, the woman is singing in her twanging voice.
</P>
<P>
   I open the door to the small kitchen and heat rushes out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you OK, Ma? Can I help you with anything?'' I ask.
</P>
<P>
   On the cutting board, colorful ingredients are spread out like a
beautiful garden: finely cut tomatoes, green peppers, black
mushooms, soft tofu, bamboo shoots, dried yellow flowers and
chopped ham. My mother is making my favorite dish: hot and sour
soup.
</P>
<P>
   Water has started boiling in the pot. I help my mother add the
colorful ingredients. Steam rises between us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to divorce your stepfather,'' she says calmly,
tears welling in her eyes. ``I decided to tell you this before you
leave.''
</P>
<P>
   I am stunned, speechless. I'd never thought she would leave my
stepfather. I knew she wasn't happy with her life after she married
him 18 years ago. He was a nice person but could never figure out
why my mother was unhappy with her comfortable secretary's job, or
why she would get mad at him for turning up the radio to listen to
those boring officially permitted operas, which had ruined her
first career.
</P>
<P>
   Many times in the past, she wanted to get a divorce. ``You can't
divorce again!'' her friends and my grandmother would gossip. ``One
woman divorces two husbands _ what would people think?!''
</P>
<P>
   I never imagined that my mother, who had swallowed the
traditional moral and social values - and her passions - all her
life, would spew them out at age 53.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why this time, Ma?'' I ask through the steam. The ingredients
swirl in the boiling water as colorful as a kaleidoscope. The girl
on the VCD finally finishes her love song.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was so quiet in the past several years,'' she says, ``and
I started to think about my own life. I realized what big mistakes
I'd made. I could have given you, your sister and brother a better
family life if I had been stronger. I blame myself all the time and
always think that you might hate me and that's why you stay so far
away from me.''
</P>
<P>
   The soup is steaming between us, distancing my mother from me,
blurring her face, and then pulling us together by circling around
us. Suddenly, I feel that I want to tell her many things that I've
never told her simply because I was not used to sharing my thoughts
with her.
</P>
<P>
   I'd never told her that the more I learned from life without
her, the closer I felt to her.
</P>
<P>
   I choke back sobs as I tell her how my cameras have taken me to
such places! Through tiny towns of Florida and to smoky cigar bars
in Havana. I could cover the news without waiting for the
Propaganda Department to tell me what to think. I'd lived in six
cities and worked for five American newspapers, even taking a
two-month solo camping trip through the States.
</P>
<P>
   I tell her how much joy and freedom I derive from my new
experiences: so much so that I now have enough confidence to go
around the world and work. I tell her that I had been afraid to
share these feelings with her because she always wanted me to
settle down.
</P>
<P>
   But wherever I go, I tell her, I owe who I am to her: Really,
she had taught me everything, about love, and, indirectly, about
following the heart and its passions. And because my siblings and I
had left her for the world, she finally had the chance to listen to
her own heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of mine and I are thinking about starting our own
choir group,'' my mother says. A big smile lights up her face. ``I
have not sung a complete song for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, we are conversing as two women. We may never
have been a perfect mother and daughter. But mothers and daughters
don't have to be perfect. For the first time, we are laughing as
two friends who had been apart for years, only to be reunited in my
mother's kitchen in Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
   My mother slowly drops in the sesame oil as a finishing touch.
We eat our soup like a communion.
</P>
<P>
   It is hot and spicy, just as I like it, and I know I will miss
it wherever my life takes me next.
</P>
<P>
   As the taxi takes me out the city gate on my way to the airport,
a funeral procession - beating drums and gongs - makes its way
slowly through the empty fields. People in white shrouds - white is
the Chinese color of mourning - carry round, colorful paper
wreaths, like archery targets.
</P>
<P>
   I think about my grandma, who is 90 this year.
</P>
<P>
   My grandma is among the last generation of Chinese woman who has
3-inch bound feet, once called ``lotus petals.'' Her toes curve
around the sole of the foot until they touch the heel. She walks
stiff-legged and sway-hipped. I always found excuses to avoid
walking with her on the street when she visited my family. She
would tease my size seven feet in return: ``Who dare to marry a
girl with big feet like you?''
</P>
<P>
   I said my feet would take me around the world.
</P>
<P>
   I look back to the city. The tall city wall is disappearing in
the distance.
</P>
<P>
   From far away in the taxi, I see the paper wreath burn and the
smoke soar to the sky. Wind carries along the ash and dust and good
wishes from the mourners, swirling in the air above the land where
ancient emperors were buried with a piece of jade placed in their
mouths.
</P>
<P>
   In the silence, an ancient poem plays its notes in my heart:
</P>
<P>
   Endless is my longing _ longing for Chang'an (Xi'an).
</P>
<P>
   High is heaven, wide is earth;
</P>
<P>
   Neither can my spirit fly,
</P>
<P>
   Nor my dreams carry me over the firm mountain pass.
</P>
<P>
   Long is the longing that crushes my heart.
</P>

 &HT;    ConsumerWatch: Cooling-Off Rule often not what buyers believe it
is
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal Cooling-Off Rule, passed by Congress in
1972 to protect vulnerable consumers from unscrupulous door-to-door
salespeople, is one of the nation's best consumer laws. But it
still remains one of the most misunderstood, which often causes
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely a week passes that we don't receive calls from readers
who say they have purchased some item, usually a car, and they want
to return it. ``Don't I have three days to change my mind?'' they
ask.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the answer is no _ and nearly always no with the
purchase of a car, unless the seller agreed to a return period,
which some dealers have begun doing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooling-Off Rule gives you three business days to cancel
many purchases made at your home, apartment, dormitory or
workplace, or a location that's not the seller's permanent place of
business, such as convention centers, fairgrounds, restaurants and
temporarily rented hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are numerous exceptions. The Cooling-Off Rule does not
cover sales that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Are under $25.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are made entirely by mail or telephone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are the result of previous negotiations at the seller's
permanent place of business where the goods are regularly sold.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are made as part of your request to do repairs or maintenance
on your home.
</P>
<P>
   Also exempt from the Cooling-Off Rule are sales that involve:
</P>
<P>
   _ Real estate, insurance or securities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Autos, trucks and other motor vehicles sold at temporary
locations, provided the seller has a permanent place of business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arts or crafts sold at fairs or locations such as shopping
malls and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Cooling-Off Rule, the federal Truth-in-Lending Law
gives borrowers a three-day ``recision period'' to cancel a
personal loan for which their home is collateral. In addition, some
states mandate cancellation periods for certain purchases
regardless of where they are made. Georgia, for example, requires
health club contracts to have a seven-day cancellation period.
</P>
<P>
   But as many shoppers have learned to their dismay, no federal
law regulates the merchandise return policies of retailers. What
items stores accept for return, refund or exchange is pretty much
up to each store to decide. Fortunately, most retailers usually
accept returns to keep customers happy.

   _ Never pick one just because it is cute.
</P>
<P>
   _ Try to meet the pup's parents; don't buy from a pet store.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spend at least a couple of hours with a pup you like. If
necessary, go back and visit it several times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't pick a dog as a fashion statement.
</P>
<P>
   _ Factor in size and activity level. The most common complaints
are from people who pick a dog that's too active, not active enough
or too large for their living space.

 &HT;    Book aims to help future dog owners find compatible breeds
 &HT;    (EDS: May run with DOGS-TIPS30-COX)
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's midmorning on a shaded nature trail that tracks
the Chattahoochee River, and the scene is funny enough to make a
dog laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny women in skin-tight togs lurch and stumble, jerked along at
full gallop by huge, hard-charging dogs on long pastel leashes.
Tall men slow to a trot to keep from outpacing panting, sad-eyed
miniature schnauzers.
</P>
<P>
   Such places can be great laboratories to examine the love people
have for their pets _ and also man's inhumanity to dog, says
Stanley Coren, a psychologist and canine authority whose avowed
mission is to slash the human-dog divorce rate. He hopes to do that
by helping people make better choices when selecting a pet. A lot
of psychology and a little common sense can make a difference, he
counsels.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, ``Why We Love the Dogs We Do: How to Find the
Dog That Matches Your Personality'' (Free Press, $24), Coren spells
out why 40 percent of all dogs that are adopted each year end up at
the pound, abandoned or dead. He blames psychological
incompatibility for most mismatches, and he advocates picking dogs
based on personality traits _ yours and the animal's.
</P>
<P>
   It's not brain surgery: If you're laid back, you don't want a
high-strung dog, he says. And you don't want a friendly dog like a
golden retriever unless you're sure you'll have the time and
patience to love it and enough space for it to romp.
</P>
<P>
   Coren's recommendations differ from others who give advice on
selecting dogs in that he stresses the importance of analyzing your
own behavior, not just the reputed personality or physical traits
of the animal.
</P>
<P>
   His last book, ``The Intelligence of Dogs'' (Bantam, $13.95),
made dog lovers howl by rating 133 breeds from dumbest to smartest.
The new book is likely to be less controversial, though it is sure
to raise the hackles of breeders who disagree with his assessment
of their dogs' personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it like I see it, and we put them where we thought they
should be,'' he sniffs.
</P>
<P>
   Coren wrote his latest book out of disgust at what happens to
dogs that are abandoned or traded in for a new model. It upsets
them, can make them neurotic and, in some cases, might cause them
to die of a broken heart, Coren says. Thousands are turned in at
shelters that try to find owners, but are forced to put dogs that
are not adopted to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Separation also can be traumatic for dog owners. They often feel
like failures or just plain dumb and may shy away from giving pets
another try.
</P>
<P>
   A University of British Columbia professor who judges dog
competitions and shows his own dogs, Coren used scientific methods
to come up with the tests outlined in his book.
</P>
<P>
   After studying the personalities of 6,149 dog owners, scores of
breeds and thousands of dogs, he devised simple psychological tests
for people in four areas _ extroversion, dominance, trust and
warmth. Based on the answers to those tests, the book recommends a
breed category. Once you choose a group, any of a dozen or more
dogs in that listing will do.
</P>
<P>
   Coren came up with those groups _ friendly, protective,
independent, self-assured, consistent, steady and clever _ after 96
veterinarians, breeders and psychologists rated 22 dimensions of
dog behavior.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't test mutts, which can be just as smart and sweet as
purebreds, Coren says. But the tests can help pick mixed breeds,
too _ just choose one that looks most like one of the dogs that
best fit your personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the tests say you'd fit well with a poodle and you see a
litter of pups that are part poodle, pick the poodliest one in the
bunch,'' he says. ``Even mutts behave predictably if you can tell
what kind of dog they look like.''
</P>
<P>
   Coren's book is the most recent to offer tips on selecting a
canine companion, but there are many other places to get advice,
from the Internet to animal shelters. Most any veterinarian can
help you pick a dog, based on factors such as your age, the size of
your home and how often you're away, says Bill Garrett, head of the
Atlanta Humane Society. He avoids recommending specific dogs
because the personalities of canines can vary widely.
</P>
<P>
   The American Kennel Club simply urges people to educate
themselves. This year, the AKC recalled the latest edition of its
``Complete Dog Book'' and apologized after complaints over its
classification of some popular breeds, including rottweilers and
Dalmatians, as not being good with kids.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Sharon Crowell-Davis of the University of Georgia, one of
only 16 certified dog psychiatrists in the country, also suggests
people should do more homework before obtaining dogs, such as
asking veterinarians and friends for advice and observing the
behavior of the parents of potential adoptees.
</P>
<P>
   After a couple of disastrous experiences with pets, Allen Bower
did some homework before buying a bichon frise.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's playful. She's laid-back. She's always glad to see you,
and she's not high-strung like a cocker spaniel we had once,''
Bower says. ``She's a perfect match.''
</P>
<P>
   Getchel Caldwell did the same, talking to breeders and reading
anything he could find on Chinese shar-peis before shelling out
$1,800 for a pup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always liked the way they looked, but I had no idea of their
traits,'' he says. ``He's strong-willed but very personable. We
have a soothing relationship. He's a great companion, like the
people I talked to said he'd be.''
</P>
<P>
   Coren stresses the importance of adopting dogs ``not for what
they'll do for your ego or image, but for your peace of mind.''
He's particularly critical of celebrities who he believes buy dogs
to fit their public image.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tyson's bull mastiff, a mean, aggressive breed that could
bite the ear off any rottweiler, may well be a good match for him,
Coren says. Evander Holyfield's Akitas _ which, like bull mastiffs,
are in the ``protective'' breed group _ jibe with his image as a
muscle-bound fighter, but not with his Mr. Nice Guy persona.
</P>
<P>
   But people who can't afford the full-time trainers that tend
celebrities' pets shouldn't buy dogs for image. A golden retriever,
which Coren places in the ``friendly'' category, will go bonkers if
it's not petted and loved enough. And no amount of hounding or
scolding can make a dog like a golden retriever crave solitude or
independence, Coren adds.
</P>
<P>
   Other advice: Don't buy a ``fad'' dog unless it fits like your
personality. For example, Jack Russell terriers, hot dogs because
of their exposure on the popular TV series ``Frasier,'' are too
temperamental for most folks, Coren says.
</P>
<P>
   Max Falls, who owns a furniture repair business, wanted an
even-tempered dog to work with his horses. So he bought an
Australian cattle dog, which Coren classifies as clever.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's well mannered. Very smart. He works real well with my
horses, and he's got a lot of spunk. And like my rat terrier, he's
feisty,'' Falls says, chuckling. ``I guess that makes us good
buddies, 'cause I can be feisty, too.

   ATTACHED _ Some people don't like to be separated from their
kids even for a little while. They shower together, sleep together,
carry the kids around in a sling and breastfeed until the kids are
old enough to say they want to stop. Because some of these
practices are unorthodox, some of these parents have formed a
support group, which is affiliated with an international
``attachment parenting'' organization. Child development types say
some of the practices are merely eccentric, but carried to the
extreme, they could be detrimental. (Richarde, Atlanta

   TEEN-JOBS30 _ AUSTIN, Texas _ More than 3 million teens
nationwide work summer jobs _ and this year, with the nation's
lowest unemployment rate in a generation, more teens may have a
better pick of the jobs they want and it already looks as if more
teens are working. But there's more to a summer job than just
money, and several experts say teens can walk away from a summer
job with valuable experience in addition to cash. (Tanamachi,

   DOGS30 _ ATLANTA _ It's midmorning on a shaded nature trai. Tiny
women in skin-tight togs lurch and stumble, jerked along at full
gallop by huge, hard-charging dogs on long pastel leashes. Tall men
slow to a trot to keep from outpacing panting, sad-eyed miniature
schnauzers. Such places can be great laboratories to examine the
love people have for their pets _ and also man's inhumanity to dog,
says Stanley Coren, a psychologist and canine authority whose
avowed mission is to slash the human-dog divorce rate. He hopes to
do that by helping people make better choices when selecting a pet.

often causes problems. Rarely a week passes that we don't receive

<P>
   President Clinton lost one and won one at the U.S. Supreme Court
on Thursday. The Line Item Veto Act was struck down. And the court
upheld the principle that death does not unravel the
confidentiality of communication between attorney and client. The
American people won in both cases.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the majority opinion for a court
divided 6-to-3 in the line item veto case (Clinton vs. City of New
York). Stevens focuses solely on the Presentment Clause _ Article
I, Section 7 of the U.S. Constitution: ``Every bill which shall
have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall,
before it becomes a law, be presented to the president of the
United States; if he approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall
return it, with objections to that House in which it shall have
originated ....'' Returning a bill is a veto.
</P>
<P>
   Congress can only override a presidential veto by a two-thirds
majority vote in each house.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens notes that the act has allowed the president to amend
laws passed by Congress by repealing portions of those laws. He
writes: ``There is no provision in the Constitution that authorizes
the president to enact, to amend, or to repeal statutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is deferential to Congress and the president in the
opinion: ``... we express no opinion about the wisdom of the
procedures authorized by the Line Item Veto Act. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The text of the act was itself the product of much debate and
deliberation in both Houses of Congress and that precise text was
signed into law by the President. We do not lightly conclude that
their action was unauthorized by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court found it unnecessary to address a second issue
raised by the lower federal court when it found the act
unconstitutional _ that the line item veto disrupts the balance of
powers between the legislative and executive branch. Stevens
writes: ``... our decision rests on the narrow ground that the
procedure authorized by the Line Item Veto Act are not authorized
by the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a stinging dissent in which he was
joined by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor and in part by Justice
Stephen Breyer. In short, Scalia doesn't think that the Line Item
Veto Act violates the Presentment Clause of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia is a master sophist; he plays word games. Under the act,
after both houses of Congress have passed a bill, the president can
sign it and then cancel portions. To Scalia the chronology of
events is pivotal, not the central meaning of the clause. He writes
in his dissent: ``It was only after the requirements of the
Presentment Clause had been satisfied that the president exercised
his authority under the Line Item Veto Act to cancel the spending
item.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Scalia is in the minority on this issue. Under any
reading of the Constitution, the act is unconstitutional. A
president's authority to amend or repeal a law is neither
enumerated nor implied by the Constitution. Quite simply, such
presidential powers do not exist _ unless Congress chooses to amend
the Constitution to give presidents that power, and three-fourths
of the state legislatures agree.
</P>
<P>
   The current problem, however, is that the 82 spending items that
Clinton cancelled using the unconstitutional law are no longer
cancelled. New York City can now expect $2.5 billion in federal
funds for its Medicaid program. And what was once a balanced budget
with a surplus is no longer.
</P>
<P>
   In the attorney-client confidentiality case, Clinton won. Back
in July 1993, White House aide Vincent Foster Jr. met with his
attorney James Hamilton for two hours regarding the controversy
concerning the White House travel office and firing employees
there. Hamilton took handwritten notes during the meeting. Nine
days later Foster committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr wanted those notes to further
his investigation into allegations that White House aides or first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton had lied under oath. Starr claimed that
when Hamilton's client died, the confidentiality of the
attorney-client privilege died with it. Fortunately for everyone,
Starr lost.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote the opinion for the 6-to-3
majority (Swidler &AMP; Berlin and Hamilton vs. United States):
``Knowing that communication will remain confidential even after
death encourages the client to communicate fully and frankly with
counsel. While the fear of disclosure, and the consequent
withholding of information from counsel, may be reduced if
disclosure is limited to posthumous disclosure in a criminal
context, it seems unreasonable to assume that it vanishes
altogether. Clients may be concerned about reputation, civil
liability, or possible harm to friends or family. Posthumous
disclosure of such communications may be as feared as disclosure
during the client's lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr had argued that the attorney-client privilege should not
prevent disclosure of confidential communications if the client has
died and the information is relevant to a criminal procedure.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, according to Rehnquist. Only two lower court decisions
support Starr's argument. Most assume the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice concludes, ``... the independent counsel has
simply not made a sufficient showing to overturn the common law
rule embodied in the prevailing caselaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr was looking only at his target and not the implications
for society. This privilege is too significant to be eroded by the
independent counsel's suspicions of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Had the high court's decision gone the other way, think of the
ambitious prosecuting attorneys who might feel free to rifle
through communications between dead defendants and their attorneys
fishing for accomplices and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Think of what the erosion of this privilege might do to the
weaker privilege of confidentiality between doctor and patient, or
to the necessary confidentiality between priest and confessional.
Then consider the likely impact on our society.

 &HT;    Theory on veterans' benefits unsubstantiated
 &HT;    By Jane Greig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For copies of Jane's book, ``Thanks for Asking!'' _ a
compilation of more than 600 favorite questions and answers _ call
288-6291 or (800) 424-6291.
</P>
<P>
   Q: During a recent conversation about the erosion of veterans'
benefits, a friend told me he thought it was because less than 30
percent of U.S. Congress members are veterans. I have been unable
to find support for these statistics. This would be interesting
information for veterans.
</P>
<P>
   _Carl M.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the American Legion's National Legislative
Commission, 46 percent of the Senate members are veterans, compared
with 32 percent of the House. Remember both are disproportionately
male.
</P>
<P>
   How does this compare with the adult male population of the
United States? Roughly 25 percent are veterans.Q: I have been
trying to locate a paperback book, ``Lavender Blue,'' by Parris
Afton Bonds. I tried several resale book stores last year and have
resigned myself to the fact that it is nowhere to be had.
</P>
<P>
   _Mary Ann A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't give up on resale shops and garage sales; the stock
changes frequently and unpredictably. As an alternative, why not
write the prolific (35 novels, 15 languages) Bonds in care of the
Southwest Writers Workshop, 1338B Wyoming Blvd., NE, Albuquerque,
N.M. 87112.Q: I just saw ``The Truman Show'' (which I loved), and I
noticed the ushers wearing ``Save Truman!'' pins. Is there any
``Truman Show'' merchandise like that available? I'd especially
love a bumper sticker.
</P>
<P>
   _Brett A.
</P>
<P>
   A: Best I could do is a Truman hat and T-shirt from the
Paramount Store ... unless you can cop one from an usher at the
theater. Call (800) 699-1085 to order from Paramount. To order a
custom-designed bumper sticker, call Sign Effects at 990-5564.Q: I
would like to know the rules about buying Beanie Babies in Canada
and how many I can bring back to the United States. If my friends
give me envelopes to put one in and I mail it from Montreal, is
that legal?
</P>
<P>
   _Kathy Cobbs
</P>
<P>
   A: Don't you think this whole thing has gotten out of hand?
</P>
<P>
   According to customs import specialist Joseph Wechman, a
``traveler can import one item bearing a recorded trademark'' for
personal use. This means one Beanie (not one bear, lobster, etc.)
per person every 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   I would not advise mailing it. You run the risk of having the
Beanie Baby confiscated. The problem has become so acute that
Beanie biggie, Ty Inc., has a hot line for people whose Beanies
have been confiscated by U.S. Customs. Call (888) 317-5488 with all
the details about your seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have heard cruises are available on freighters as opposed
to the higher-class cruise ships. Do you have names and addresses
of those that sail the Caribbean out of Texas or Louisiana ports?
</P>
<P>
   _Bob K.
</P>
<P>
   A: Many freighters depart New Orleans for Houston before heading
for Central and South America or the Caribbean. Egon Oldendorff,
Ivaran Lines and Reederei Bernhard.
</P>
<P>
   To book passage, contact a service such as TravLtips of the
Cruise &AMP; Freighter Travel Association, P.O. Box 580188, Flushing,
N.Y. 11358 or by phone at (800) 872-8584.
</P>
<P>
   The positives of freighter travel? Passengers enjoy the extended
time at sea without large crowds of Kathie Lee Gifford clones. The
negatives? Freighters' main concern is cargo, not passengers, so
you must be flexible regarding time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read bilberry is beneficial to the eyes. I inadvertently
purchased some bilberry leaf instead of the fruit. Does the leaf
have similar benefits?
</P>
<P>
   _S. Tomkins
</P>
<P>
   A: Check with your doctor before taking any medication.
</P>
<P>
   World War II flyers reported increased night vision as a result
of munching on bilberry jam. Current bilberry boosters say it
decreases the effects of computer screen-induced eye strain. The
Herb Bar, 200 W. Mary St., stocks the leaves and reports some help
is available from both leaves and fruit.
</P>
<P>
   Author Shannon Quinn agrees and advises beginning gradually (one
cup of bilberry tea a day). Remember to pulse herbs _ three weeks
on and one off _ for best results.Q: We are selling a garage that
has about 500 cans of very old paint. How can we dispose of this
paint for a nominal fee?
</P>
<P>
   _C. Reece
</P>
<P>
   A: Glad you are disposing of this paint before you sell the
property. Many buyers find out too late that hazardous waste on the
property is conveyed.
</P>
<P>
   Five hundred cans exceeds the household quantity of 30 gallons
at the City of Austin Hazardous Waste Collection Facility, 4411
Meinardus Drive (416-8998). If the paint is latex (and latex only),
remove the lid and let the paint dry. Put the lidless can in your
pay-as-you-throw City of Austin trash collection.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If I ever get lucky enough to meet Dame Judi Dench, I need to
know protocol. How would I address her? Do I curtsy? To avoid a
severe faux pas, how does she pronounce her last name? Where can I
write her?
</P>
<P>
   _Tania Blanton
</P>
<P>
   A: Loved ``Mrs. Brown''!
</P>
<P>
   Dame Judi Dench (rhymes with ``trench'') is addressed as ``Lady
Dench'' in conversation and on paper as ``Dame Judi Dench,
D.B.E.,'' Dame of the British Empire _ one of the top rungs of the
Order of the British Empire. (Glad we don't have to remember
peerage!)
</P>
<P>
   Helen Mann of the British Consulate says Americans are not
really expected to curtsy and in England one curtsies only to royal
family members. Write Dame Dench in care of Julian Belfrage
Associates, LTD, 46 Albemarle St., London W1X 4PP England.Q: I
would like to know the average cost per prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   _T.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: In Texas the average institutional cost per day per inmate
(general population) was $38.64 in fiscal 1996, says Larry
Fitzgerald, Department of Criminal Justice. ``The Corrections
Yearbook'' by the Criminal Justice Institute estimates the national
average cost per day per inmate (state and federal prisons) is
$54.25.Q: In February I ordered painted daisies, English primroses
and dwarf daylilies from Michigan Bulb Co. I finally received the
daisies and English primrose, which were dead.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the shipment was to be sent separately. I waited
three weeks; nothing arrived. After three letters the company
finally sent me part of the money. So I sent another letter with a
copy of my cashed check explaining I had not received the rest of
my shipment _ to no avail. I've been sending mail to: Michigan Bulb
Co., 1950 Waldorf N.W., Grand Rapids, MI 49550.
</P>
<P>
   _Bonnie C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Customer service spokeswoman Gina Snyder said the address is
correct. Follow up with a phone call to (616) 735-2100. But it's
easy to run up a phone bill trying to get money back. I sent your
letter to the company and Snyder said you should have your money or
bulbs within two (tops three) weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A friend in Minnesota collects skulls and skeletons of
various animals, mostly those found locally. He runs a summer camp
and I would like to give him a bit of Texas for his collection.
</P>
<P>
   Who sells armadillo skeletons/armor? This would be a great gift
and a constant reminder of his transplanted friends.
</P>
<P>
   _Colleen Huey
</P>
<P>
   A:The best selection of skulls _ alligator to warthog _ is
available from Wildlife Skulls of Texas at (713) 465-8088.
Armadillo skulls run $45. Seems steep since ranchers frequently
find these skulls.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A favorite food, Stouffer's frozen rarebit, has disappeared
from the supermarket freezer. What is the story? I asked three
different people and got three different answers: 1) What's
rarebit?; 2) Didn't know we stocked it; and 3) Dunno, used to be
around some.
</P>
<P>
   _J.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: Welsh rarebit is a common British dish usually made of
cheese, ale or milk, and spices served over toast. Some call it
Welsh rabbit but there is no hare in it.
</P>
<P>
   Stouffer's still makes Welsh rarebit, so speak to the manager of
your supermarket. If your pleas are not answered, call customer
service at (800) 225-1180.Q: My husband is responsible for the
meditation at our church. We recently heard Dr. Laura Schlessinger
read an article written by a father about the time he has with his
children. Can you get a copy?
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Lyday
</P>
<P>
   A: Requests for tapes (no transcripts) are obtained by calling
the office of the poohbah of pop psychology at (818) 461-5403.
Tapes are $40 per hour and are only available for the two weeks
after the airing. prior to a request. On her Web site,
www.drlaura.com, recent monologues and letters are posted. Nothing
matched your request, but I found letters from listeners such as
``Great truths about life that little children have learned,''
which includes ``You can't trust dogs to watch your food.'' Q: My
daughter bought a bread machine at a garage sale. It has a cookbook
referring to the manual (not included, of course). Can you help
find a manual for a Welbilt, model ABM-100?A: To purchase a manual
($7.50) call Welbilt customer service at (800) 872-1656. Grab the
paper when you dial. I was on hold for 10 minutes.Q: If you
withdraw money from an Individual Retirement Account for a
first-time home purchase, are you excused from the penalty for
withdrawing from an IRA? What forms are needed?
</P>
<P>
   _M.S.
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Generally you are excused from the withdrawal penalty but
not from the taxes,'' says IRS spokesman Kenneth Vargas. Other
guidelines regarding this withdrawal include a $10,000 cap and use
of the money for qualified costs within 120 days of distribution.
For more information, ask for IRS publication No. 553 by calling
(800) TAX-FORM or check the IRS Web site at www.irs.ustreas.gov.
</P>
<P>
   The form you need is No. 8606, which is available by calling the
above number.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I notice an abundance (inside and out) of small
centipede-like creatures _ brown, about an inch long and maybe 1/8
inch wide. What are they?
</P>
<P>
   _Jake L.
</P>
<P>
   A: Millipedes, probably.
</P>
<P>
   Millipedes love piles of wood chips or mulch. ``They are more or
less scavengers and can build up in high numbers. They are probably
entering your home to seek shelter, like a lot of other things
right now, looking for moisture,'' says Texas A&AMP;M's critter wizard
John Jackman.
</P>
<P>
   Millipedes have two or more pairs of legs per body segment;
centipedes, one pair. Reduce the millipede invasion by removing any
leaves or organic debris from your home's exterior. Once inside,
you can sweep away millipedes or crank up the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is Kenneth Starr's mailing address?
</P>
<P>
   _Dante C.
</P>
<P>
   A: Send your missive to: The Honorable Kenneth W. Starr, Office
of the Independent Counsel, 1001 Pennsylvania Ave., N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20004. The salutation? ``Dear Judge
Starr.''Contact Jane Greig at P.O. Box 670, Austin 78767; (512)

<P>
   The subject was the intoxication of language. ``We don't know
where it begins,'' Boston Globe columnist Patricia Smith said at a
conference in San Diego last year. ``It could begin when a toddler
holds a wooden alphabet block up to the light and the letters find
their backbones and become real . . . It could be when two
beautiful and nappy-headed girls jump double-dutch so feverishly
that it sends electric jolts through the muscles in their calves,
and the spark moves through their hearts and into their mouths and
they give birth to a rhyming song they didn't know they had . . .''
</P>
<P>
   She was captivating, inspiring. From time to time I listened to
the tape of Smith's speech, rejuvenated by her creativity and
passion for language.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with a sense of betrayal bordering on the personal
that I heard that Smith resigned last week, admitting she made up
quotations and even people in her twice-weekly column. Thursday,
for the first time in its history, the American Society of
Newspaper Editors withdrew the 1998 Distinguished Writing Award it
had given to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been a banner month for journalism. In late May,
Stephen Glass, a 25-year-old associate editor of The New Republic,
fabricated at least a portion of two-thirds of the 41 articles he
had written for the political journal.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's inventions included a cancer patient named Claire who
reacted to therapies that showed promise in mice: ``Right away, I
said, 'Rub it on my skin, pop it to me in a pill, shoot me up with
it.' If I could find a way to steal it, I would. Hell, if I could
get my hands on it, I'd swallow the whole . . . mouse.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Globe allowed Smith to write an ``apology'' that read more
like an apologia. Excuse after hollow excuse. She had never gone to
journalism school, so ``I set out to be 10 times as good by doing
10 times as much. Write columns. Author books. Write and perform
poetry. Make films. Pen and star in plays. Gig at Scullers with a
jazz band.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you don't need to graduate from journalism school to
understand that it's wrong to lie. As for her other excuses _ she
was too busy to tell the truth? Too much of a hotshot?
</P>
<P>
   After anger subsided, I simply felt baffled. Why would you ever
need to make something up when there's such amazing material in
real life?
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons I love my job is that people always surprise
me. You could sit around all day and ponder, and you'd never come
up with stories that are as compelling, quotes that are as
profound, funny, moving or appalling.
</P>
<P>
   People tell you things you know you wouldn't tell your mother or
your best friend. Humbled by the trust they have placed in you, you
pray that you can bring them to life, do their stories justice.
Invariably you fall short _ your failures a daily reminder that the
writing is in service to the subject matter, not the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   I went back to Smith's speech. ``We don't know where it
begins,'' she said. ``It could begin when a fourth-grader discovers
the word 'anemone,' and rolls it around and around in her mouth
simply because it feels so good and that day maybe she says it
1,000 times.''
</P>
<P>
   What a sad contrast with the words of Globe ombudsman Jack
Thomas: ``What Smith had done was to take the language she says she
loves and twist it into something grotesque. She had manipulated
readers, betrayed colleagues and made a burlesque of what is the
soul of not only journalism, but all writing, and that is to write
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how gifted the writer, or how seductive the words,
that is where it begins.

 &HT;    Summer job changed young man's life and Mercedes-Benz, too
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the greatest challenges facing any automaker
today is bringing the right product to market.
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue that Mercedes-Benz is doing an exceptional job:
the E-Class, sporty SLK and M-Class sport-utility vehicle are all
blessed with exceptional customer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Just how does a carmaker make the right decision at the right
time? Many rely on research groups, previous sales data and
managerial skills.
</P>
<P>
   Often it is just a gut feeling. Sometimes they are right,
sometimes wrong. Recently, wrong hasn't appeared in the
Mercedes-Benz vocabulary. Its secret weapon may well be its North
American president, Mike Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is not a typical auto executive, and neither is his
background. After graduating from college, Jackson planned on a law
degree. The purchase of a Mercedes 190 SL in need of repairs
changed his life and, possibly, too, the corporate face of
Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   With few mechanical skills, Jackson took a summer job at a
Maryland Mercedes dealer. He found he not only had a knack for
things mechanical, he actually liked the work.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months later, he was the shop foreman. His affinity for
the job did not go unnoticed. He soon became a factory
trouble-shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a service department couldn't resolve a problem, I'd
better,'' Jackson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   From his dealing with customers on this job, he realized he
enjoyed interaction with people and made a move to corporate
marketing. His family realized a law career was not in the cards.
Jackson had cars, and especially Mercedes-Benz, in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   The chance arose to buy the Mercedes dealership where he had
originally started, and Jackson took it. But he kept telling the
guys in Germany, ``You've got a great product, but you've got to
change the way you do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Mercedes tired of hearing this, responding, ``If you
know so much, come back to corporate and see if you can do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson could hardly believe the German automaker was ready to
accept change. ``Then I found out that their idea of change was in
Germany and mine might as well have been on the moon. We were
worlds apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, Jackson won out, providing a fresh personal
focus on how a luxury carmaker can do business.
</P>
<P>
   Sales figures don't lie. For the first time, in 1997, Mercedes'
sales in the United States topped 100,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many domestic automakers are considering the
death of coupes and niche hot-rod offerings, Mercedes has brought
to market the slick CLK coupe to compete with 3-Series BMW and
Lexus SC 300 and 400. It has stuffed a potent 302-horsepower V-8
into a subtle C-Class sedan, the AMG C-43. With 0-to-60 mph in 5.9
seconds, Jackson and company realized the C-43 isn't for everyone.
With the help of super tuner AMG, they are bringing in only 500
units per year for the next three years to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't contend to have one car for all people, but we
believe Mercedes-Benz has one model or another that can personally
fit most drivers' needs, desires and wishes,'' Jackson said.

 &HT;    Test Drive: In the Chevy S-10 truck, three's not a crowd
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not going to happen, but wouldn't it be nice if
all pickups came with extended cabs and a third door? Of course,
there'll always be buyers for two-door, regular-cab models, but
it's amazing how much convenience and utility the extra space and
door add, particularly to a compact like the Chevrolet S-10.
</P>
<P>
   Comparison drives between the bright red test vehicle with
optional V-6 engine and four-speed automatic transmission and a
black regular cab with the standard four-cylinder engine and
five-speed manual transmission were conclusive: Both are useful and
practical, but the extended cab and third door significantly
improve everything but the price (roughly $11,000 base price for
the standard truck; about $15,000 for the larger cab).
</P>
<P>
   Compared with most other options offered, Chevrolet's
driver's-side third door is a bargain at $295. Other option prices
on the tester, which totaled $21,167, included $710 for power
mirrors, locks and windows and $395 for a tilt wheel and cruise
control. Load some work-related items, haul a few groceries or put
a third occupant on the extended cab jump seat, and you'll
understand why more than half of the plus-cab S-10s sold have a
third door.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison drives also proved that, yes, the 175-horsepower
V-6 engine is preferable to the 120-hp four-cylinder, but is the
extra power worth the loss of 3 to 5 miles per gallon in fuel
economy? Remember, most buyers don't make serious beasts of burden
of compact trucks. They're for what the industry calls ``personal
use,'' not for some other use, whatever that might be.
</P>
<P>
   When put to personal use, the S-10 is not carlike in its ride,
handling and overall comfort level, but both versions were
reasonably quiet, had excellent ergonomics because of a dash
redesign for '98 and sported adequate seating. Minuses include the
leg- and ankle-bumping seat adjustment handle that sticks straight
up on the outboard front of the bottom cushion and a shifter-clutch
pairing on the four-cylinder that demands familiarity. Unloaded,
both trucks entertained occupants with wheel hops on bumps and
other irregular pavement, and there's no reason to expect the
extended cab S-10's optional sport suspension package ($455) to do
anything but harden the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Positives include good visibility, drink holders molded into the
door pockets, not-so-cheap-appearing plastic and cloth in the cabin
and good headlamps (also new for '99) that automatically go from
daytime running lights to full-beam status as visibility vanishes.
The new passenger-side air bag is switchable, and all S-10s come
with power anti-lock disc brakes.
</P>
<P>
   As the sales numbers (expected to be about 240,000 units this
year) and average price ($16,300) of the S-10s sold indicate,
Chevy's neat little compact has a lot going for it, and all of it
is far more enjoyable and useful when there's an extended cab and a
third door.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Test vehicle: 1998 Chevrolet S-10 rear-drive, extended-cab

 &HT;    Beware: Bogus offers aplenty for credit cards
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fraudulent credit card offers are the kudzu vine of
consumer cons. They keep coming back, despite constant efforts to
eradicate them.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu will thrive almost anywhere where there's a little bit of
dirt. Fraudulent cards thrive on the need for credit _ and
consumers who have difficulty obtaining credit are prime targets
for the bogus offers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement
with SureCheK Systems, an Atlanta-based firm that allegedly assured
consumers they would receive a credit card, regardless of their
credit history, if they paid $129 upfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``In almost all cases, they failed to provide the cards, and in
others they failed to disclose additional processing and annual
fees,'' the FTC said.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 500 million major credit cards, such as Visa
and MasterCard, circulating in the United States, and tens of
millions of consumers annually receive offers for credit cards. The
vast majority are legitimate, but fraudulent ones keep appearing
around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic ways to spot the real offers from the bogus
ones:
</P>
<P>
   _ With rare exceptions, legitimate offers will be made by a bank
or credit union, not some firm of which you've never heard. Look
out for copycat names that might imply the firm is a bank or credit
union when it's not.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is never a requirement to pay an advance fee to receive
a regular bank credit card. In a few cases, a bank or credit union
offering a secured credit card _ a card for which you establish a
savings account as collateral _ will charge a small application
fee. But never pay an application fee to any firm other than a bank
or credit union for a secured card.

 &HT;    Cyberscene: Get informed about heat-related ills
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just about the coolest thing a person can do on the
Internet at this time of the year is to find ways to get out of the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of Web sites that suggest ways to stay cool
during the hot summer.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop is at the Atlanta-based Weather Channel site at
http://www.weather.com. That organization has a special site at
http://www.weather.com
</P>
<P>
   /safeside/heat/ devoted to dealing with the heat.
</P>
<P>
   You'll learn right away that staying cool in the extreme heat is
more than just a way of being comfortable. It can save your life.
You are reminded, high up on the page, that: ``In 1995, extreme
heat contributed to the deaths of almost 500 people in Chicago. And
that same year, it killed more people in the United States than all
other natural disasters combined.''
</P>
<P>
   So pay attention as you follow the well-thought-out links on
this page. At the click of your mouse, you can be whisked to areas
that tell you what you can do to stay cool (and safe) during a heat
wave; how to determine if your age or physical condition put you at
special risk; and how to prepare for a heat emergency.
</P>
<P>
   While sunburns aren't as serious as a heatstroke, they are very
common in the South. And since long exposure to the sun can
increase your risk of skin cancer, it's worth your time to learn
about protecting your skin from serious burns. So before we leave
the excellent Weather Channel site, let's drop in at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .weather.com/health/sunpro
</P>
<P>
   .html.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find out about sunscreens and lotions, but _ for those
who want to be really scientific about fighting the sun _ you can
also follow a link from this page to learn how to read the Weather
Channel's ultraviolet forecast maps that show the intensity of
these rays in different parts of the country. The UV ratings _
which start at zero and go to levels beyond 10 _ can call for
protection as simple as wearing a hat (at levels of 2 or below) to
staying inside if you can (when levels are 10 or higher).
</P>
<P>
   Our next site also originates in Atlanta. It's from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. The page, called ``Extreme Heat
_ A Prevention Guide to Promote Your Personal Health and Safety''
can be found at http://www.cdc
</P>
<P>
   .gov/nceh/programs/emergenc
</P>
<P>
   /prevent/heat/heat.htm. While the information isn't as
well-organized as what's offered by the Weather Channel, you will
find links from this page to topic areas that offer the same sort
of common-sense advice you got from your mother. For instance, you
are told to drink plenty of fluids, pace yourself when working in
the heat and to wear appropriate clothing. While most people who
have enough sense to come in from the heat already know these
things, you'll find plenty of details and tips that may come as a
surprise. For instance, it's smart _ on a really hot day _ to avoid
extremely cold beverages since the contrast in the temperatures can
actually produce a harmful shock to your system in some instances.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Federal Emergency Management Agency site, the last
heat-related page on our tour of hot sites says that even a cool
shower after coming inside from hot temperatures can ``result in
hypothermia, particularly for elderly and very young people.''
</P>
<P>
   So even common sense can fail you in hot weather. But, as long
as you're inside in air-conditioned comfort surfing the Web, you're
safe from even the hottest day.

 &HT;    Mac News: Excel makes better use of Mac's innovations
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the uninitiated, Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet
program has always been an 800-pound gorilla _ powerful and
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, because the program can be very useful if you're
not scared off by its impenetrable appearance and seemingly endless
list of features.
</P>
<P>
   In Excel 98, the latest version, Microsoft's programmers wisely
switched strategy. Instead of adding yet more functions, they
focused on making Excel easier to use and understand.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a program that, while still at times overwhelming,
is greatly improved. Here's a look at some of the more important
changes.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of my list is 16 levels of undo and redo. Many users
have long been reluctant to try Excel's powerful functions, fearing
a mistake would mess up their stock portfolio or home finances. Now
you can go back or forward 16 steps at a time. Nearly any misstep
can be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Excel now also lets you quickly check a formula analyzing a set
of numbers. For starters, there's a feature called AutoCorrect,
which automatically identifies and corrects 15 of the most common
formula errors.
</P>
<P>
   You can also double-click a spreadsheet cell with a formula, and
Excel will highlight any data involved in it. That way you can
quickly check to see if you've included the right numbers for the
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Another nifty improvement is the ability to name in English a
cell or range of cells. You can, for example, name a row of figures
``June sales.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes work easier yet, because then you can use that named
range of cells in a formula instead of typing in an arcane list of
cell addresses. For example, you could write a formula that says
``June sales minus June expenses.'' Now isn't that easier than
typing A4:B6 - C3:C8?
</P>
<P>
   Excel now includes lots of formula templates, easily accessible
from the upper left corner of any spreadsheet. Select one of these
templates and plug in your own cells or numbers. You can also cut
and paste parts of the templates to form formulas of your own.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Microsoft had ignored Apple Computer's
innovations in the Mac versions of its software. Excel 98 reverses
this practice. It reflects the new look of OS 8 and its
improvements, including contextual menus, drag-and-drop and sticky
menus. You can also easily link data between documents.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy Excel as a stand-alone product for $399 (the upgrade
is $149) or get it as part of Office 98. It's a suite of programs
that includes Word, Outlook and Proponent in addition to Excel.
Office retails for $499 (the upgrade is $299).

 &HT;    COLUMN: What's wrong is wrong, in deed and journalistic word
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The subject was the intoxication of language. ``We don't know
where it begins,'' Boston Globe columnist Patricia Smith said at a
conference in San Diego last year. ``It could begin when a toddler
holds a wooden alphabet block up to the light and the letters find
their backbones and become real . . . It could be when two
beautiful and nappy-headed girls jump double-dutch so feverishly
that it sends electric jolts through the muscles in their calves,
and the spark moves through their hearts and into their mouths and
they give birth to a rhyming song they didn't know they had . . .''
</P>
<P>
   She was captivating, inspiring. From time to time I listened to
the tape of Smith's speech, rejuvenated by her creativity and
passion for language.
</P>
<P>
   So it was with a sense of betrayal bordering on the personal
that I heard that Smith resigned last week, admitting she made up
quotations and even people in her twice-weekly column. Thursday,
for the first time in its history, the American Society of
Newspaper Editors withdrew the 1998 Distinguished Writing Award it
had given to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been a banner month for journalism. In late May,
Stephen Glass, a 25-year-old associate editor of The New Republic,
fabricated at least a portion of two-thirds of the 41 articles he
had written for the political journal.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's inventions included a cancer patient named Claire who
reacted to therapies that showed promise in mice: ``Right away, I
said, 'Rub it on my skin, pop it to me in a pill, shoot me up with
it.' If I could find a way to steal it, I would. Hell, if I could
get my hands on it, I'd swallow the whole . . . mouse.'''

   The Globe allowed Smith to write an ``apology'' that read more
like an apologia. Excuse after hollow excuse. She had never gone to
journalism school, so ``I set out to be 10 times as good by doing
10 times as much. Write columns. Author books. Write and perform
poetry. Make films. Pen and star in plays. Gig at Scullers with a
jazz band.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, you don't need to graduate from journalism school to
understand that it's wrong to lie. As for her other excuses _ she
was too busy to tell the truth? Too much of a hotshot?
</P>
<P>
   After anger subsided, I simply felt baffled. Why would you ever
need to make something up when there's such amazing material in
real life?
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons I love my job is that people always surprise
me. You could sit around all day and ponder, and you'd never come
up with stories that are as compelling, quotes that are as
profound, funny, moving or appalling.
</P>
<P>
   People tell you things you know you wouldn't tell your mother or
your best friend. Humbled by the trust they have placed in you, you
pray that you can bring them to life, do their stories justice.
Invariably you fall short _ your failures a daily reminder that the
writing is in service to the subject matter, not the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   I went back to Smith's speech. ``We don't know where it
begins,'' she said. ``It could begin when a fourth-grader discovers
the word 'anemone,' and rolls it around and around in her mouth
simply because it feels so good and that day maybe she says it
1,000 times.''
</P>
<P>
   What a sad contrast with the words of Globe ombudsman Jack
Thomas: ``What Smith had done was to take the language she says she
loves and twist it into something grotesque. She had manipulated
readers, betrayed colleagues and made a burlesque of what is the
soul of not only journalism, but all writing, and that is to write
the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter how gifted the writer, or how seductive the words,
that is where it begins.

<P>
   UNDATED: I Got the Hook-Up R ...
</P>
<P>
   The Land Girls R
</P>
<P>
   More outlandishly soap-opera-ish than genuinely affecting, this
movie about the young women who volunteered to work British farms
during World War II isn't anyone's finest hour. The Dorset
countryside is lushly beautiful, the historical situation
fascinating and the actors (Catherine McCormack, Rachel Weisz, Anna
Friel) good. But it comes off a missed opportunity more than
anything else. Rated R for sex. 1 hour, 55 minutes. (ER) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   The Last Days of Disco R
</P>
<P>
   A disco movie for anyone who wasn't into disco (and maybe even
for those who were). Master cinematic sociologist Whit Stillman
(``Metropolitan'') looks at the young and the restless and the hip
and the privileged in the early '80s whose social lives revolve
around a Manhattan disco. The fine ensemble cast is headed by Kate
Beckinsale (``Cold Comfort Farm''). Rated R for language, drug use,
female nudity and brief sex. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Les Miserables PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A handsome, well-acted version of the Victor Hugo epic ...
though you may miss the songs. Police inspector Javert (Geoffrey
Rush) once again tracks former convict Jean Valjean (Liam Neeson)
through the countryside and alleyways of 19th-century France.
Directed by Bille August (``Pelle the Conqueror''), the movie's
worth a look even if it lacks the novel's breadth and vision. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Lost in Space PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A movie that has all the flash and depth of the latest Nintendo
game. Based on the campy '60s TV show, ``Lost in Space'' throws in
vicious space spiders, genetic monsters, confusing time-travel
elements and heavy doses of family values. There's also Gary Oldman
as the evil Dr. Smith, and ``Friends'' hunk Matt LeBlanc as the
arrogant pilot Major West. Predictably, the movie has an open
ending, suitable for sequels. Rated PG-13 for intense sci-fi
action. 2 hours. (SM) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Man in the Iron Mask PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Swashbuckling escapism at its best. Leonardo DiCaprio plays dual
(and dueling) roles in this adventure based on the Dumas novel
about a masked youth, imprisoned by his twin brother, King Louis
XIV and aided by the Musketeers (Jeremy Irons, John Malkovich,
Gerard Depardieu, Gabriel Byrne). Written and directed by Randall
Wallace (``Braveheart''), the movie isn't just for Leo-maniacs; it
has a fine streak of aging-legend melancholy, too. 2 hours, 7
minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Mulan G
</P>
<P>
   The best Disney animated feature since ``Beauty and the Beast''
and ``The Lion King.'' Based on a 4th-century legend, it's about a
young girl who pulls a National Velvet, i.e., disguises herself as
a boy and goes to battle in her elderly father's place. This isn't
just a grand family film; it's a grand film, period. As Eddie
Murphy's little red dragon says, ``Mulan, you the man!'' 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   The Opposite of Sex R
</P>
<P>
   Christina Ricci's teen tart burns across the screen in this
acerbic yet strangely sweet black comedy. The convoluted plot kicks
off when Ricci visits her gay half-brother (Martin Donovan) and
steals his dim-bulb lover (Ivan Sergei). The eclectic (and fine)
supporting cast includes Lisa Kudrow and Lyle Lovett. Rated R for
vulgar language, sexual situations, some nudity and sexual
references. 1 hour, 40 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Out of Sight R
</P>
<P>
   Another winning adaptation of a book by Elmore Leonard, the
brain that cooked up ``Get Shorty.'' George Clooney plays a courtly
bank robber, Jennifer Lopez is the federal marshal he kidnaps. In
outline, this is a screwball romantic comedy. It just happens to be
propelled by firepower, betrayal, bloodshed _ and the erotic
gravitational pull between the two leads. Rated R for language. 2
hours, 9 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Paulie PG
</P>
<P>
   A solid, sweet kid flick. Paulie is a wisecracking parrot (voice
by Jay Mohr of ``Picture Perfect'') who is separated from his
beloved owner, a 5-year-old girl named Marie. The bulk of the movie
is Paulie's picaresque adventures as he goes from one owner to
another, trying to find his way back. ``Paulie'' doesn't have the
magic or emotional depth of ``Babe,'' but it's well-crafted and
provides an ending with a lovely twist that can appeal to kids and
adults alike. Rated PG for brief mild language. 1 hour, 27 minutes.
(SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   A Perfect Murder R
</P>
<P>
   Not perfect, this ``Dial M for Murder'' remake is still a guilty
pleasure, a slick B-movie jazzed up with great clothes, art
direction and decent plot twists. Michael Douglas plays a business
shark whose boom is going bust, so he attempts to hire his wealthy
wife's lover to kill her. Rated R for language, sex and violence. 1
hour, 47 minutes. (SM) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Quest for Camelot G
</P>
<P>
   This action-packed animated feature is a kid-pleaser with enough
humorous asides to keep adults interested, too. During the time of
King Arthur, a plucky girl dreams of becoming a knight and finds
herself responsible for saving Camelot. Gary Oldman, Don Rickles
and Eric Idle are among the more recognizable voices. 1 hour, 28
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Six Days, Seven Nights PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Think ``Romancing the Stone'' ... only without the romance or
the adventure. Harrison Ford is a gruff charter pilot and Anne
Heche is a New York magazine editor. They wind up stranded on an
island near Tahiti _ an abandoned place, except for some pirates.
The pair bicker, bond and kick some pirate butt. Rated PG-13 for
sexual entendres and implied sex. 1 hour, 41 minutes. (SM) Grade:
C+
</P>
<P>
   Sliding Doors R
</P>
<P>
   Gets jammed on its own cliches. The gimmick is a pair of what-if
scenarios: what happens if a young woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) makes a
subway train and what happens if she misses it. Paltrow is
appealing, as is John Hannah as the stranger she meets either way.
But essentially, it's a gimmick in search of a story. Make that,
two stories. Rated R for language and mild sex. 1 hour, 35 minutes.
(ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Prisoner PG
</P>
<P>
   More fiendish fun 'n' games with David Mamet. A naive young
inventor (Campbell Scott) is the patsy/hero in a complex confidence
game. Steve Martin is surprisingly good as a well-connected but
mysterious businessman who befriends him. An insubstantial but
deliciously entertaining scam of a movie. Rated PG for language and
mild violence. 1 hour, 52 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Species II R
</P>
<P>
   The principal difference between this one and ``Species'' is _
well, there really isn't a difference. Michael Madsen is back,
trying to keep Natasha Henstridge (a clone of the character she
played in the first film) from having sex and spreading alien DNA.
The only real fun is in listening to the audience call out the plot
points before the characters find them out. Rated R for language,
sex and gore. 1 hour, 35 minutes. (Newhouse News Service) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Titanic PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The ship goes down, but the movie stays afloat. Writer-director
James Cameron harnesses Hollywood's latest high-tech tricks to tell
an old-fashioned romance for the gals that doesn't neglect the
guys, either. Kate Winslet plays an upper-crust Philadelphia girl
returning from Europe on the Titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio is a
scrappy artist who has admired her from afar. Rated PG-13 for
disaster-related peril and violence, nudity, sensuality and brief
language. 3 hours, 14 minutes. (SM) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   The Truman Show PG
</P>
<P>
   Jim Carrey's excellent performance is the centerpiece of this
provocative, thoroughly entertaining social satire about a cheerful
insurance salesman who slowly realizes his entire life has been a
TV show and everyone he knows are actors. Peter Weir directs this
dazzlingly executed conceit and the strong cast includes Laura
Linney and Ed Harris. Rated PG for mild language. 1 hour, 44
minutes. (ER) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Marshals PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lee Jones returns as U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard in this fine
sequel to ``The Fugitive.'' This time, Gerard's on the trail of an
ex-CIA operative implicated in two murders, played by Wesley
Snipes. While this installment lacks some of the emotional
resonance of the original, it offers an exhilaratingly detailed
look into what it takes to be a fed _ the stakeouts, the video
surveillance, the occasional rooftop runs. Through it all, Jones
attacks his role like a pit bull. He makes single-mindedness seem
like a superhuman trait. Rated PG-13 for violence and language. 2
hours, 11 minutes. (DH) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Wilde R
</P>
<P>
   A dutiful, decorous rendition of a man who was anything but.
This Cliff's Notes version of Oscar Wilde's life gives us Wilde as
playwright, wit and gay martyr, but leaves out the importance of
being Oscar. Still, Stephen Frye gives a tremendous performance in
the title role. Rated R for nudity and sex. 1 hour, 56 minutes.
(ER) Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Woo R
</P>
<P>
   An uneven but spirited comedy about trying to find true love
amid a meat-market mentality. Jada Pinkett Smith is the title
character, a woman who's been so burned by the doggy behavior of
guys, she approaches her latest blind date (Tommy Davidson) with
the determination to prove his innate canine drive. Rated R for
language, sex and marijuana smoking. 1 hour, 32 minutes. (SM)
Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The X-Files PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Bigger but not really better. Though the feature film
continuation of Fox's conspiracy-mad TV series offers more gore and
profanity, it never accelerates to that stratospheric level of
action, suspense or awe that we hope for in a summer movie. As FBI
agents Mulder and Scully, David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson take
a smooth step up from television to the big screen. Rated PG-13 for
mild language, gore and violence. 2 hours, 2 minutes. (SM) Grade:
B-
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Armageddon PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Following on the heels of the hit comet/disaster flick ``Deep
Impact'' comes this thriller about an asteroid (there's the
difference between the two movies) hurtling toward earth and the
he-men heroes sent to destroy it. Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck
star. _ July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Avengers PG
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman play stylish crime-fighters John
Steed and Emma Peel in this big screen update of the sly '60s TV
series. Sean Connery co-stars as the pair's megalomaniacal nemesis,
Sir August De Wynter. _ Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Madeline PG
</P>
<P>
   Children around the world have treasured Ludwig Bemelmans' 1939
book about the misadventures of a French schoolgirl. It's finally
been made into a movie, starring Hattie Jones as Madeline and
Frances McDormand as Miss Clavel. _ July 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Mask of Zorro PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Hopkins plays the legendary Latin avenger in this summer
blockbuster hopeful which presents Zorro as an aging hero in search
of a successor. Antonio Banderas plays the troubled thief who
inherits the titular mask. _ July 17.

   Almost Heroes PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A comic version of Lewis and Clark, with Matthew Perry and the
late Chris Farley as mismatched 19th-century explorers. Novel and
giddily silly at first, but simply dopey by the end. Rated PG-13
for brief nudity, strong language and comic violence. 1 hour, 29
minutes. (Newhouse News Service) Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Barney's Great Adventure G
</P>
<P>
   What you've seen is what you get. In his feature debut, Barney
joins three kids in the country on an adventure involving a
mysterious egg. Along with perpetually cheerful Purple One, the
movie offers a parade, a circus, a hot-air balloon race and other
attention-keeping delights. The target audience _ say, the
under-threes _ will be satiated. 1 hour, 15 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Silence PG-13
</P>
<P>
   A film worth listening to. Germany's Oscar nominee for best
foreign-language film concerns a musical prodigy who is also her
hearing-impaired parents' crucial link to the rest of the world.
Sensitive and well-acted, the film uses a specific situation to
explore a universal one: how children must learn to separate from
their parents without cutting them off. In German with subtitles.
Rated PG-13 for brief nudity. 1 hour, 45 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   The Big Hit R
</P>
<P>
   The big ho-hum. Treading territory that ``Grosse Pointe Blank''
covered better last year, ``Hit'' ponders the problems of a
professional killer trying to maintain a domestic life. Mark
Wahlberg plays Mel, a hit man torn between mowing down mobsters and
romancing a girlfriend (Lela Rochon) and a fiancee (Christina
Applegate). Rated R for violence, language, and some sexuality. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Bulworth R
</P>
<P>
   Provocative, funny, and unbalanced _ just like politics.
Director, star and co-writer Warren Beatty plays the titular
senator from California, who breaks down while watching his latest
re-election commercials. Hiring a hit-man with himself as the
target, he returns to campaigning, where his meltdown becomes very
public. Rated R for profanity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Can't Hardly Wait PG-13
</P>
<P>
   You won't want to wait . . . for the movie to end. This teen
comedy about an end-of-the-school-year all-night party shirks
subtlety whenever a broad stroke will get us there faster. Jennifer
Love Hewitt plays Amanda, the goddess of the just-graduated senior
class. Ethan Embry is the sweet, sensitive guy who, the movie tries
to convince us, deserves to be her boyfriend. Rated PG-13 for
profanity, simulated sex, drug and alcohol use. 1 hour, 38 minutes.
(SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   Character NR
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Oscar winner for best foreign language film, this dour
but compelling Dutch import is laden with Dickensian incident and a
Kafka-esque sense of fate. Set in 1920s Rotterdam, it's the tale of
a relentless war waged between a formidable father (Jan Decleir)
and his illegitimate son (Fedja van Huet). Not exactly a
light-hearted romp, but so much happens you barely notice. Not
rated but there is brief sex, nudity and violence. Subtitles. 1
hour, 57 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   City of Angels PG-13
</P>
<P>
   In this Hollywood-style adaptation of Wim Wender's great film
``Wings of Desire,'' Nicolas Cage plays an angel who wants to trade
in his wings for an earthly fling with a comely heart surgeon (Meg
Ryan). Directed by Brad Silberling (``Casper''). (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Cousin Bette R
</P>
<P>
   Balzac's 1846 novel may have been whittled down, but there's
still much to like about this deliciously tart comedy of
ill-manners and worse morals that slowly ripens into a revenger's
tragicomedy. Jessica Lange stars as the overlooked and
underestimated spinster who devises some elaborate revenge
scenarios for her shallow, wealthy relatives. The artful supporting
cast includes Elisabeth Shue and Bob Hoskins. Rated R for sex and
nudity. 1 hour, 48 minutes. (ER) Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   Deep Impact PG-13
</P>
<P>
   The impact here is human, which is pretty gutsy since, going in,
we all know this is about a giant comet hurtling toward Earth.
Director Mimi Leder harks back to 1959's ``On the Beach'' in her
determination to show that worldwide catastrophes can be measured
one human life at a time. Her strong cast is headed by Tea Leoni,
Morgan Freeman, Elijah Wood and Robert Duvall. Rated PG-13 for
violence, language and end-of-the-world jitters. 2 hours, 3
minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Dirty Work PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Laughless comedy starring an insufferably smug Norm Macdonald,
the comic who was booted from his slot as ``Weekend Update'' anchor
on ``Saturday Night Live.'' MacDonald plays an allegedly charming
prankster who launches a revenge-for-hire business. Rated PG-13 for
language and comic nudity. 1 hour, 35 minutes. (Newhouse News
Service) Grade: D
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Dolittle PG-13
</P>
<P>
   This raucous but uninspired Eddie Murphy vehicle has almost
nothing to do with the old Rex Harrison musical. Murphy is John
Dolittle, a busy doctor who has neglected his wife (Kristen Wilson)
and his two daughters. One day, all kinds of animals start
pestering him vocally. Despite the zing of some nuttier moments,
the lame plot keeps dragging the movie to the ground. Rated PG-13
for crude humor and language. 1 hour, 30 minutes. (SM) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   Everest NR
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' This
44-minute documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm
that killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' Cameraman David Breashears
fills the screen with awesome vistas, but discreetly avoids the
piles of discarded oxygen tanks, human waste and frozen bodies that
now litter the trails of the mountain. This is a film whose cruel
beauty manages to celebrate the spirit of the climbers, while
making you question their sanity. (SM) Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas R
</P>
<P>
   Too much is never enough for both fabled gonzo journalist,
Hunter S. Thompson, and filmmaker Terry Gilliam. Thus Gilliam's
version of Thompson's 1971 book about his drug-drenched visit to
Vegas has a brilliant first hour and an excessive second one. But
Johnny Depp gives an amazing, uncompromised performance as
Thompson. Rated R for vulgar language, violence and extensive drug
use. 2 hours. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Godzilla PG-13
</P>
<P>
   He's back. He's big. He's boring. There was probably no way
Hollywood's extravagant update of ``Godzilla'' could live up to its
year-long hype. What's depressing is how far it falls short from
being even solid summer escapism. Bikini Atoll resident Godzilla
comes to nest in Manhattan when it's time to think of family
matters. Matthew Broderick is a biologist on the monster's trail.
Rated PG-13 for sci-fi action/violence. 2 hours, 19 minutes. (SM)
Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Good Will Hunting R
</P>
<P>
   A feel-good movie from Gus Van Sant sounds like an oxymoron, but
that's exactly what this pleasant, warm-hearted film is. Matt Damon
stars as a math genius who works as a janitor at MIT rather than
fulfilling his potential. Robin Williams is the eccentric
huggy-bear shrink who helps the kid embrace his brains. Damon
co-wrote the script with Ben Affleck and in this case, their excess
of heart is heartening. Rated R for language and sexual situations.
2 hours, 5 minutes. (ER) Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Hav Plenty R
</P>
<P>
   Plays like the first draft of what might have been a good
comedy. Writer-director-star Christopher Scott Cherot is Lee
Plenty. Dateless on New Year's Eve he happily accepts an invitation
to a party from his friend Havilland (Chenoa Maxwell), whom he
secretly adores. Cherot is a likable performer, but he doesn't have
the movie star wattage his role needs. Rated R for language. 1
hour, 32 minutes. (SM) Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   He Got Game R
</P>
<P>
   Spike Lee gets it together in this celebration/expose of high
school hoop dreams. Denzel Washington is a jailbird dad who could
earn a reduced sentence if he can convince his hot-prospect son
(Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray Allen) to play for the governor's alma
mater. Not a slam-dunk, but close enough. Rated R for sex, nudity
and language. 2 hours, 10 minutes. (ER) Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Hope Floats PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Never flies, but never sinks either. Sandra Bullock teams up
with director Forest Whitaker (``Waiting to Exhale'') for this
affecting story of a woman who goes back to her small-town home to
lick her wounds after her husband has an affair. Also stars Harry
Connick Jr. and Gena Rowlands. Rated PG-13 for language and illicit
kissing. 1 hour, 54 minutes. (ER) Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   The Horse Whisperer PG-13
</P>
<P>
   There are far worse ways to pass the time than riding the range
with Robert Redford. In this old-fashioned, emotionally satisfying
story, the director/star plays a cowboy whose magic way with horses
has a healing effect on humans, too. Also stars Kristin Scott
Thomas. Rated PG-13 for violence and sex. 2 hours, 48 minutes. (ER)
Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   I Got the Hook-Up R
</P>
<P>
   This inner-city comedy about two street-corner entrepreneurs,
Black (Master P) and Blue (A.J. Johnson), who come into a cache of
cell phones, is so generic, in both style and story, that it could
be an ``In Living Color'' parody. To its credit, there are hardly
any crossed signals here. ``I Got the Hook-Up'' clearly isn't aimed
at ``The Horse Whisperer'' crowd. Still, it's a pretty shoddy
product by any standards. Rated R for extremely vulgar language,
sexual innuendo, comic violence and extensive female nudity. 1
hour, 33 minutes. (ER) Grade: D+

 &HT;    Netw(at)atch: franklymydear.com complements movie
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tomorrow is another day.
</P>
<P>
   It's also another day to see the 1939 classic ``Gone With the
Wind'' on the big screen the way it was meant to be seen. A
generation of mothers and grandmothers will be taking their teenage
daughters and granddaughters off to see their generation's
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a generation of daughters and granddaughters can take
the opportunity to check out ``GWTW'' on the World Wide Web and
maybe teach mom and grandma a little bit about cybersurfing at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   The official ``Gone With the Wind'' Web site has an easy address
to remember, http://www.franklymydear.com. ``GWTW'' buffs know this
is Rhett's (Clark Gable) parting shot to Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) at
the movie's end and one of the most memorable and classic lines
ever uttered in film (next to DiCaprio's ``I'm king of the world,''
of course.).
</P>
<P>
   New Line films, the distributor of the newly restored film, has
created a beautiful site, filled with classic photos and trivia. A
special treat is the time line, which gives an amazing
month-by-month account of the making of the movie. Visitors learn
about casting problems, costume problems and the insistence of
African-American cast members that certain words be deleted from
the script. In the '90s, its very trendy for movie companies to put
up Web sites for their films, but this site for the 1939 classic
has to be one of the richest, most informative and beautiful Web
sites ever done to complement a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the film are also fascinated with Margaret Mitchell and
her best-selling novel, on which the movie is based. While visitors
to Atlanta won't be able to find Scarlett's fictional homestead of
Tara (not that this stops them from asking directions), they can
visit the Margaret Mitchell House in person or on the Web at
http://www.gwtw.org. Here, visitors can read up on the woman who
penned the novel.
</P>
<P>
   The house, which is located in Midtown Atlanta, was one of
Mitchell's many homes and the one where she wrote most of ``Gone
With the Wind.'' Mitchell's story is also an interesting step back
into what the world and the South was like in her time. The design
is simple, and there is a lot of reading, but it's good reading.
</P>
<P>
   The Gone with the Wind Online Exhibit (http://www.lib
</P>
<P>
   .utexas.edu/Libs/HRC/HRHRC/DOS/GWTW/GWTW.html) is a project of
the Harry Ransom Humanities Center at the University of Texas at
Austin. It's a wonderful repository of ``GWTW'' memorabilia,
historical documents such as producer David O. Selznick's memo to
Louella Parsons, and pictures of the original costumes, including
the famous ``curtain rod'' dress. The site is elegantly designed
and a fascinating look behind-the-scenes at the making of ``Gone
With the Wind.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Much ado about nothing most of the time
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Here and there in the news with occasional
commentary, and a story of my own:
</P>
<P>
   ``I read, therefore I am amused ... and occasionally dismayed.''
_ Socrates (loose translation because I don't read Greek).
</P>
<P>
   Disclaimer: The following material contains nothing of political
or social significance and carries a rating of GG (Good Grief!).
</P>
<P>
   Local newspaper: Foreign Minister Gohar Ayub Khan when asked if
Pakistan had carried out additional nuclear tests: ``Yes, by the
grace of God.''
</P>
<P>
   God is in the bomb business?
</P>
<P>
   West Coast reader: ``It used to be called brainwashing'; now it
has a different name _ rap.' ''
</P>
<P>
   East Coast reader: ``My 11-year-old came home from school with
this joke. He thought it was hilarious:
</P>
<P>
   Question: ``What do you do when your mother staggers out onto
the porch?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``Shoot her again.''
</P>
<P>
   This is humor?
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but only to the generation who will be running the country
in our Social Security years.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspaper headline: Mooning threatens Navy officer's
career. ``A would-be career officer with a Ph.D. could be dismissed
from the Navy because he mooned a buddy while jogging at the
Pensacola Naval Air Station.'' The lieutenant, an aerospace
physiology instructor, was ordered to undergo two psychological
evaluations and was charged with indecent exposure and conduct
unbecoming an officer.
</P>
<P>
   Can't help wondering: If he'd done it in a bar, would that have
come under the heading of acceptable military behavior?
</P>
<P>
   Psychological evaluations? Because a guy bared his butt? Come
on, Navy, he's probably getting ready to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   Story time: Year _ 1981. Place _ sidelines of a soccer field at
a small, private school in west Georgia. The team (coed) is at
practice; my son is goalie. The headmistress and I sit in the shade
and watch.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, a county school bus rolls by on the road above the field.
Kids hang out the windows yelling insults at our players,
questioning their sexual orientation because they have girls on the
team. This has been happening daily for a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, same place: ``Look at Denise run!'' the headmistress
cheers as a gangly girl of 13 charges down the field, controlling
the ball the whole way. ``You know,'' she exults, ``we just might
win that game tomorrow.'' We exchange odds on the possibility, and
then the conversation wanders away from the playing field and onto
other things. Suddenly, we notice the quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are all of the boys up on that hill next to the road? What
is that they're doing?'' she asks, squinting at the distance.
``Where are the girls?'' Seconds later, we spot the three girls
behind a big old tree, out of sight of the road. ``What's going
on?'' a now highly suspicious headmistress asks.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is just rounding the bend in the road. As the big
yellow school bus comes alongside our practice field with heads
hanging from every window yelling insults, the entire Oak Mountain
Academy soccer team bares their butts in a perfectly orchestrated
response to the abuse they have been enduring for days.
</P>
<P>
   The headmistress gasps. The girls behind the tree gape. I
giggle. The boys are too far away from all of us for any details to
be noticed. In other words, we can't see much, but the county bus
is getting an eyeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God!'' the headmistress chokes out, ``did you see
that?''
</P>
<P>
   I raise my eyebrows, widen my eyes and answer: ``See what?''
</P>
<P>
   She turns, studies my fibbing face for a moment, and tests the
waters. ``Quite right. Yes, of course. We saw nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of seconds, the girls are out from behind the tree
and everyone is back on the practice field hard at work, kicking,
defending, and glancing our way to see what's going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   After a few moments of thought, in an aside, the headmistress
says to me, ``They handled the timing rather well, don't you
think?'' I assure her it was the most efficiently choreographed
mass mooning I had ever witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   End of discussion. It became a non-event.
</P>
<P>
   As is 90 percent of the daily news.

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Old, familiar antenna magical at enhancing
reception
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hard for technology to shock people anymore. Once
upon a time, folks sat open-mouthed at their first sight of a
television set. When radio was first invented, some people
seriously thought it might be the work of devils. And nowadays we
have computers that can read handwriting, understand human speech
and translate more languages than a platoon of U.N. translators.
</P>
<P>
   So _ compared to all that _ I have my work cut out for me when I
tell you that the most magical technological device that I know is
an antenna. For most of you, an antenna is one of those ugly
aluminum things that once sprouted on rooftops across America. It
was replaced by cable TV and lately, in increasing numbers by the
pizza-sized dish antennas used by satellite TV systems.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why an antenna is such a magic device, think of
how it works. In its simplest form _ maybe one of those whip
antennas you find on portable radios and TVs _ it's no more than a
hunk of metal. There's no need to power it with electricity. Yet it
captures tiny electrical signals broadcast by the radio or TV
station and then translates those signals into music and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent more than my share of time building antennas because
of my ham radio hobby, sometimes stringing hundreds of feet of wire
between tall trees just so that I could talk and listen to people
around the world. Most of you will never have to embarrass yourself
in front of your neighbors as I have _ using a casting rod in my
back yard trying to get a fishing line over a tree so that I could
use that line to pull a rope over the tree so that I could hoist up
the wire. I'll never forget the way the neighbors peered out their
windows, wondering what kind of fish I hoped to catch in a tall oak
tree.
</P>
<P>
   But now that a lot of us live and work in steel-and-concrete
cages in the form of high-rises and apartment buildings, there are
practical reasons to learn a little about antennas. An
acquaintance, here at the newspaper, complained to me the other day
that her fancy portable shortwave radio couldn't pull in many
stations. And here at the newspaper, you can't pick up many of the
local AM stations.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in both cases isn't the strength of the signals. The
problem was that the buildings themselves _ both at the newspaper
and the place where my friend lives _ were blocking the signal.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the newspaper, we solved the problem by putting up a
simple wire antenna _ the kind you can buy at Radio Shack for about
$10 _ on the roof. Then we used coaxial cable _ that's the same
kind of shielded cable used to pipe in cable TV signals _ to
connect the antenna to the radio.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what I'll do with my friend. The outside antenna
doesn't have to be fancy at all to pick up commercial shortwave
stations or the local AM broadcast. In cases like the ones I
mentioned, the purpose of the antenna isn't to amplify the signal,
it's simply to grab the signal from a point outside the steel cage
and then to pipe that signal inside.
</P>
<P>
   You may be in the same boat. Even some homes have enough wire
and steel in them to make any kind of radio _ shortwave or regular
AM _ pretty feeble. The good thing about this problem is that an
antenna is one of the few technological devices that the average
person can build for himself. Unlike transmitting antennas, the
shape and length of the wire you use isn't all that important (in
fact, with most portable radios, you actually don't want to have
too big of an antenna _ the signal can overload radios built to
work with a whip antenna).
</P>
<P>
   So, whether you're trying to pull in a shortwave station from a
station in Beirut or just listen to the Braves on your broadcast
radio, consider draping a short length of wire out the window and
connecting it to the antenna terminal on your radio.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind how antennas work is maddeningly complex, but
building them isn't.

 &HT;    Tech Report: Listen up _ minidisc or CD-RW?
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dueling formats _ you know the story.
</P>
<P>
   It could be VHS against Betamax. Or compact discs against vinyl.
Fax vs. e-mail, vs. the Postal Service. Among wireless phones, it
could be traditional cellular against personal communications
services, or analog against digital.
</P>
<P>
   In connecting to the Internet, there is a coming battle between
phone lines called Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines, known as
ADSL, and cable modems running over cable lines. And for them to
succeed, they must both overcome the slower but more entrenched
modems.
</P>
<P>
   The formats clash. Sometimes one dies, and sometimes they
coexist. Television did not kill radio _ although both were changed
by the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Music in the past few decades has provided some high-stakes
confrontations _ and plenty of reasons for consumers to place bets
on a winner by spending billions of dollar on a format. And if they
bet on a loser, well, they get to bet all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Before there were CDs, cassettes had to stomp eight-track
players and reel-to-reel. Quadraphonic sound arrived roaring and
expired quietly. Before that, long-playing vinyl records learned to
live with the 45 rpm single. That was, after the LP dealt a
post-World War II death blow to the old 78 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Now the industry is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   The minidisc is a format that offers users a chance to pick
their own selections. It lets people customize their workout or
driving music. There is a recording deck at home, but the medium
you carry is nice and light, affordable and portable.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds kinda like the cassette, doesn't it? And that is just
what the minidisc makers want to replace. After all, the minidisc
is a digital format, a far superior recording to cassette.
</P>
<P>
   Minidisc, while big in Japan, has never been a smash here. Sony
years ago introduced it to thundering apathy. Not one to be easily
beaten, Sony came back into the market about 18 months ago with a
new version and a marketing blitz. Prices for some minidisc
recorders have fallen since then from $600 to under $500 _ with
some still-cheaper machines to be released this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the minidisc has a new foe: the rewriteable compact disc.
The CD-RW has some potential advantages _ most obviously, that it
comes in the CD format. But the folks at Sony want you to know that
minidisc is easier to record, smaller and more portable than the
CD-RW. Sony also notes that current CD players cannot play CD-RW,
although any machine that can play CD-RW can play all your other
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle is still evolving. Both CD-RW and minidisc have
yet to amass the kind of market size that can make all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highest-profile makers of the technology are Philips
(http://www.philips
</P>
<P>
   .com/home.html) and Ricoh (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .ricohdms.com/welcome.html). Another good place to start for
more information about CD-RW and other similar technologies is a
Web site run by Worldspan Communications
(http://www.span.com/shoptext
</P>
<P>
   /c.htm).
</P>
<P>
   For more information about dealers selling the minidisc, call
Sony (1-800-222-SONY). For information about Sony's products, visit
the company Web site (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .sony.com).
</P>
<P>
   High-tech ethics
</P>
<P>
   Computer error? Yeah, sure.
</P>
<P>
   Technology offers choices, and apparently an awful lot of
Americans are choosing to do things with it that are somewhat ....
questionable, including the use of technology as an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   A study shows nearly half of America's workers have ``engaged in
unethical actions'' related to new technologies, according to the
report commissioned by Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America and
State Farm Insurance Cos.
</P>
<P>
   The study was released by the American Society of Chartered Life
Underwriters, the Chartered Financial Consultants and the Ethics
Officer Association.
</P>
<P>
   The second-most-common behavior listed in the study was
``wrongly blaming an error you made on a technological glitch,''
which 14 percent of those surveyed admitted to. Nearly the same
number acknowledged using office equipment to shop on the Internet
and copying company software for home use.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more ominously, nearly 50 percent reported that
technology was causing them increased on-the-job pressure. But
perhaps a lot of answers depend on your definition: More than half
of those responding said playing computer games during work hours
and using e-mail for personal messages was not unethical. By
contrast, 70 percent said using technology to intrude unnecessarily
on privacy was unethical _ for example, paging an employee during
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But the most common confession was one familiar to any Atlanta
commuter: 19 percent of those surveyed said they have created ``a
potentially dangerous situation by using new technologies while
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Is your computer watching you?
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has released a report on privacy to
Congress that seems to show the long arm of the Internet reaching
into your home and office.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on an online survey of 1,400 commercial Web
sites, concluded that upward of 85 percent of Web sites collect
personal information, while only 14 percent provide any notice
about that practice, according to the Electronic Privacy and
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   The center called the findings proof ``that self-regulation has
been so far unsuccessful.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report is available online
(http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/reports.htm). A previous report by the
center, called ``Surfer Beware,'' is also online
(http://www.epic.org
</P>
<P>
   /reports/surfer-beware.html).

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Many frustrations of computing call for the touch of
a poet
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I occasionally meet people who, upon finding that I'm
the guy who fills this space, tell me that they often read it but
rarely understand it, because it's too technical for them.
</P>
<P>
   I seldom know how to reply. I would like to take it as a great
compliment that my prose is presumably so intrinsically riveting
that people habitually read it even though they know they cannot
understand it. However, this smacks of fetishism, of some bizarre
kind of literary masochism. I am reluctant to assist in such
pursuits. Who knows where they might lead?
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, this column is dedicated to the literati among you
who run computers despite an innate loathing of them; consider it
your reward for reading this column even when it bewilders you.
</P>
<P>
   For those more involved in computers than poetry, I should
probably make clear that these are haiku, a form of Japanese verse
made with only three lines, the first usually consisting of five
syllables, the second of seven and the third of five.
</P>
<P>
   I am indebted to Dr. Frank Miller of Greenville, S.C., who sent
them to me, and to a gentleman named Robert Shiarella, who sent
them to Dr. Miller, and to whomever wrote them, wherever he/she may
be. She/he is a true artist.
</P>
<P>
   Three things are certain:
</P>
<P>
   Death, taxes, and lost data.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which has occurred.
</P>

   No one hears your screams.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing my great fault

</P>
<P>
   Chaos reigns within.
</P>

   Reflect, repent, and reboot.
</P>
<P>
   Order shall return.
</P>
<P>
   First snow, then silence.
</P>
<P>
   This thousand dollar screen dies
</P>
<P>
   So beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   The code was willing.
</P>
<P>
   It considered your request,
</P>
<P>
   But the chips were weak
</P>
<P>
   ABORTED effort:
</P>
<P>
   Close all that you have.
</P>
<P>
   You ask way too much.
</P>
<P>
   You step in the stream,
</P>
<P>
   But the water has moved on.
</P>
<P>
   This page is not here.
</P>
<P>
   The Tao that is seen
</P>
<P>
   Is not the true Tao, until
</P>
<P>
   You bring fresh toner.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Not quick enough for browser.
</P>
<P>
   Timed out, plum blossom
</P>

</P>
<P>
   We'd tell you where, but then we'd
</P>

   But the water has moved on.

<P>
   Your expensive computer

 &HT;    Summer jobs mean more than cash
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the cool artificial air of Barton Creek
Square Mall, somewhere between the Food Court and The Gap,
17-year-old Sabrina Villasana sits on a stool at an ice cream kiosk
watching shoppers meander by.
</P>
<P>
   A customer strolls up and Villasana springs into action, smiling
and asking in her best saleswoman's voice, ``May I help you,
ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a phrase she speaks a hundred times an afternoon, just one
part of the 23-hour-a-week ritual known as the Summer Job at the
Mall. More than 3 million teens nationwide work summer jobs _ and
this year, with the nation's lowest unemployment rate in a
generation, more teens may have a better pick of the jobs they want
and it already looks as if more teens are working. In April the
national teen unemployment rate was 13.1 percent, lower than the
15.6 percent unemployment rate of April, 1997, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of that elusive freedom that only money brings, older
teens will do everything from peddling Gap jeans and ice cream to
lifeguarding and mowing lawns. But there's more to a summer job
than just money, and several experts say teens can walk away from a
summer job with valuable experience in addition to cash.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Brain, author of ``The Teenager's Guide to the Real
World,'' advises young workers to ask lots of questions _ get to
know the business from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't simply stand at the register looking bored,'' he said.
``Actively try to learn about the different aspects of the
business. There are millionaires who own their own restaurant
franchises, but it isn't easy to run a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Gossett, director of development at Junior Achievement
of Central Texas, a nonprofit organization that teaches students
from kindergarten through 12th grade about business, says her
organization encourages teens to find summer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any opportunity you have to learn is beneficial for your
future,'' she said. ``You may not want to flip burgers for a living
forever, but the skills you learn here _ responsibility and
teamwork _ can parlay into other jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Labor, on average, 51.3 percent
of teens work retail summer jobs and 33.8 percent work service
summer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Teens covet mall jobs, since they pay just above minimum wage,
the workplace is air-conditioned, and the hours are never too early
or too late, said Henry Nguyen, 19, who works at the Sunglass Hut
at Barton Creek Square Mall in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very stressful, like when I waited tables last
summer,'' he said. ``And I think you can learn a lot, especially if
you ask questions and really try to understand how things work.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens not yet old enough to work at the mall might try being
entrepreneurs _ perhaps starting a lawn mowing or babysitting
service, or learning how to create Web sites, Brain said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Quattrociocchi, a national speaker and consultant on work
issues, said teens should be wary of settling for just any job.
</P>
<P>
   ``While working can be helpful, it can also be harmful _ earning
should be connected to learning or it's a bad,'' she said. ``Teens
should look for a job that's the closest to where they want to end
up. If you're not interested in the food business, then don't get a
fast-food job.''
</P>
<P>
   Quattrociocchi said teens can look for fields that interest
them, such as car repair or the record industry, and then seek out
gofer-type jobs or volunteer positions in related companies. That
way, teens are exposed to the career fields they're most interested
in, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now a teen might say, how does a volunteer job help me earn
money?'' Quattrociocchi said. ``Well, you get connected to everyone
working in that field by volunteering. These are the people who
will tell you where the jobs are. Once they can see you care and
have skills, they'll start recommending you for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing, the experts agree, is not to waste a
summer doing something you hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible to spend a whole summer being miserable,'' Brain
said. ``And money doesn't make up for misery.''

<P>
   A steadicam follows Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone
through the lobby of a Holiday Inn in Hollywood, past the check-in
desk, past a frosted glass mural of Marilyn Monroe, through
faux-grand doors and outside, where the passing traffic hisses and
wheezes on Highland Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The two keep up a steady patter as they go, Fraser gesturing
wildly, like a silent-movie clown.
</P>
<P>
   They're shooting a comedy called ``The Blast from the Past,''
with Fraser playing Adam, a young man who'd been raised in an
elaborate underground bomb shelter since the 1962 Cuban missile
crisis by a paranoid scientist father, Christopher Walken, and
mother, Sissy Spacek _ ``June Allyson on Listerine,'' Fraser calls
her.
</P>
<P>
   Now in the 1990s, in spite of its hydroponic garden and fish
tank, the family is running out of supplies. Adam emerges to seek
batteries, toilet paper _ and a girl.
</P>
<P>
   And here he is, not the psychopath one would expect after a
childhood like this, but a clean-cut, rather starchy fellow with
early-'60s values and impeccable manners.
</P>
<P>
   He develops an instant crush on tough cookie Silverstone, whom
he meets while trying to cash in a l950s Joe DiMaggio baseball
card.
</P>
<P>
   Silverstone, all sausage curls and trademark petulance, is
complaining to Adam about her lack of a boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never works out, because I'm into butts and legs and hair
myself, so I always end up with some guy who's more shallow than I
am.''
</P>
<P>
   No boyfriend? Adam goes into hormonally induced paroxysms of
glee.
</P>
<P>
   Cut. Do it again. And again. And again, as extras playing
Scandinavian tourists mingle with genuine British travelers,
bemused and jet-lagged as they stagger off a bus and wander into a
Hollywood movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brendan was born to play this part,'' says writer-director
Hugh Wilson, a pleasant-faced man in chinos. ``It's all about
innocence, and Brendan exudes innocence.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Fraser's furrowed brow always manages to give him
a rather sweet air of faint bewilderment, which he used to comic
advantage in ``George of the Jungle'' and which made him touchingly
vulnerable in ``School Ties,'' the l991 movie about teen-age
anti-Semitism that gave him his big-screen break.
</P>
<P>
   But at 6 feet 3 inches, the 29-year-old Fraser is also a great
lunk of a guy. During a lull in filming, he's settled into a
nondescript armchair, his oversized feet planted firmly on the
carpet in a suite on the 22nd floor of the location hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Against a decorating nightmare of lurid flowered curtains and
fake floral arrangements that could have time-warped out of the
movie, Fraser is talking up a storm, hands flying in all directions
to punctuate his points.
</P>
<P>
   He's usually called shy, a description that makes him balk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm thoughtful,'' he says. ``And I'm told I have
infrared vision. I like to understand people before I present
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he adds, he likes to save himself for his performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many comedians won't say boo to you, but put them in front
of a microphone and they blister the wallpaper.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what he did to the screen in ``George of the Jungle,''
last summer's surprise hit with kids and critics alike.
</P>
<P>
   A $100 million-plus box-office gross put the movie on Daily
Variety's Golden Reel list of top moneymakers for 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``So hoo ha for the business end of the things,'' says Fraser,
whose price tag jumped from $1 million for ``George'' to several
million. He also gained a new audience of 7-year-olds, who laughed
at earnest George, and their mothers and baby-sitters, who gulped
at the sight of his well-toned muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wardrobe was about the size of a tea-towel,'' says Fraser,
who began a mad weight-lifting routine when he got the part.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it never really seemed like enough,'' he says about his
physique, which he considered nothing more than part of his George
costume. ``I'm glad they took a picture of it, because it sure
doesn't stay that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser has gotten used to things not staying the same for long.
His father traveled the world promoting Canadian tourism, and the
family went along. The youngest of four brothers, Fraser lived in
Britain, the United States, Canada and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Early on, he was introduced to the Buster Keaton movies that he
draws on now for comic roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's immense dignity in playing a clown. We're
asked to do everything no one else wants to do, only with
panache,'' he says, perhaps remembering his title role in ``Encino
Man'' _ his other loincloth movie _ in which, as a prehistoric man
unfrozen after millions of years, he shared a dish of dog food with
a Labrador retriever.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the move may also have had something to do with Fraser's
becoming an actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It influenced me at an early age to be open to different
people,'' he says. ``Or to invent them, or beg, borrow or steal
from them, and pretend they were mine all along.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor's first brush with theater came in an unlikely
setting: the Upper Canada College in Toronto, a New World
incarnation of a British public school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't paddled, but we were definitely tested again and
again,'' he remembers. ``We were little businessmen in our suits.
We weren't making money, but we were making marks. That was our
income. I can attest to that: All the old boys have gone on to the
Canadian equivalent of Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   He, on the other hand, discovered the small campus theater _ not
as a budding actor, but by stage-managing and selling tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the bug had bitten. After a stint at the Actor's
Conservatory at Seattle's Cornish College of the Arts, he was on
his way to grad school in Texas when he stopped in Los Angeles to
make money.
</P>
<P>
   He never left. And just a year later, he landed the coveted lead
in ``School Ties,'' an ensemble movie in which he co-starred with
Matt Damon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was wonderful. The same guy you see today,'' Fraser says of
Damon. ``He wasn't trying to make himself look good to charm an
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser glances through the hotel window at a grim-looking urban
vista obscured by gray mist, and recalls his first reaction to Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt distanced from it,'' he says. ``As I look out right
now, I can't say I recognize this view, because it's always
changing every time I turn around _ if you can see it through the
thick air.
</P>
<P>
   ``But then again,'' he continues, ``there's that kind of misty
quality that makes for great black-and-white photography.''
</P>
<P>
   Fraser, who collects old Polaroid cameras, describes himself as
``a spectacular amateur'' photographer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He takes his cameras everywhere. Takes them to dinner. Maybe
hides behind them. I don't know,'' says director Wilson, who
invited Fraser to his Virginia farm to get acquainted before the
movie.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson has five children and notes that Fraser, possibly out of
shyness, spent more time playing with the kids than talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fraser remembers arriving at the farm after
surviving a combination of back-slapping and ``jealous glares'' at
his Upper Canada College 10th-year reunion.
</P>
<P>
   He'd flown from Toronto into Washington D.C., and the studio
sent a stretch limo to pick him up. He arrived to find Wilson, in
raincoat and hat, waiting for him atop a John Deere tractor.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Fraser lives in Hollywood with girlfriend Afton
Smith, a former actress he describes as ``dreamy.'' They plan to
marry and live somewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a homebody,'' he says _ dashing the fantasies of a slew of
prepubescent girls and their mothers. ``I've discovered things like
fleece-lined doeskin slippers. Given that and a choice between a
cocktail party ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm drawn to what I don't have,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   What he has very little of, apparently, is free time. With the
success of ``George'' and his newly perceived image as Hollywood
hunk, Fraser is on a hot streak, finding more scripts coming his
way than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Still Breathing,'' which came out in April, he was a
longhaired innocent again, this time a San Antonio street performer
in search of the true love he's envisioned in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   He was also recently in Morocco, shooting a techno-version of
the 1939 ``The Mummy,'' and in the upcoming ``Gods and Monsters,''
he stars as the fictional boyfriend of a movie director played by
Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the innocence of some of the characters he plays,
the actor himself looks at it all with a faintly jaundiced eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times this is a Restoration comedy,'' he says about
Hollywood. ``We're seeking favor in court. There are jealousies and
rivalries. It's a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds, ``the meaning of `play,' is fun.''

surviving a combination of back-slapping and ``jealous glares'' at
his Upper Canada College 10th-year reunion.
</P>
<P>
   He'd flown from Toronto into Washington D.C., and the studio
sent a stretch limo to pick him up. He arrived to find Wilson, in
raincoat and hat, waiting for him atop a John Deere tractor.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Fraser lives in Hollywood with girlfriend Afton
Smith, a former actress he describes as ``dreamy.'' They plan to
marry and live somewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a homebody,'' he says _ dashing the fantasies of a slew of
prepubescent girls and their mothers. ``I've discovered things like
fleece-lined doeskin slippers. Given that and a choice between a
cocktail party ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm drawn to what I don't have,'' he concludes.
</P>
<P>
   What he has very little of, apparently, is free time. With the
success of ``George'' and his newly perceived image as Hollywood
hunk, Fraser is on a hot streak, finding more scripts coming his
way than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Still Breathing,'' which came out in April, he was a
longhaired innocent again, this time a San Antonio street performer
in search of the true love he's envisioned in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   He was also recently in Morocco, shooting a techno-version of
the 1939 ``The Mummy,'' and in the upcoming ``Gods and Monsters,''
he stars as the fictional boyfriend of a movie director played by
Ian McKellen.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the innocence of some of the characters he plays,
the actor himself looks at it all with a faintly jaundiced eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``At times this is a Restoration comedy,'' he says about
Hollywood. ``We're seeking favor in court. There are jealousies and
rivalries. It's a play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' he adds, ``the meaning of `play,' is fun.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time when Michael Bailey, an expert in computer
graphics development, toed the party line: He told people that a
two-dimensional image of an object on a computer screen could
convey as much detail and enlightenment as the real thing.
</P>
<P>
   But over the past few years he's become something of a heretic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I have to tell those people that I was wrong,'' he says.
``It's embarrassing, but graphics are just not as good as having an
object to touch and hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has rediscovered a need that we all, as babies,
instinctively recognized. When babies see something new, they
immediately want to explore it with their tiny fingers. It's the
way they acquire a solid working knowledge of the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   Now a growing number of scientists are discovering, along with
Bailey, that a picture just won't do for their purposes, either.
</P>
<P>
   Objects large and small can be represented with physical models
_ and these are Bailey's new passion.
</P>
<P>
   Walk into his office at the San Diego Supercomputer Center and
you can't help noticing them littering his desk. Most have the
color, heft and polished softness of carved wood. His collection
includes a human heart, fist-size molecules and a strangely
flattened jack-o'-lantern.
</P>
<P>
   They look like solid wood, but all were crafted from paper and
glue.
</P>
<P>
   The sculptor was a copy machine-size device called the Helisys
1015 Laminated Object Manufacturing Rapid Prototyping System _ or
LOM.
</P>
<P>
   The LOM is the star of the center's Tele-Manufacturing Facility,
which Bailey runs.
</P>
<P>
   (The LOM, a computer in Bailey's office and a link to the
Internet constitute the entire Tele-Manufacturing Facility.)
</P>
<P>
   The Tele-Manufacturing Facility represents the latest chapter in
the decade-long history of the attempt to turn computer graphics
into solid models _ a process known as rapid prototyping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've found that even before you pick up the model and touch
it, you've already gathered more information than if you just
looked at it on a flat computer screen,'' Bailey says. ``We're
trying to figure out why, but my hunch is that it has something to
do with the way your eye can vary its focus on a solid model.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Johnson, a structural biologist at the Scripps Research
Institute, a LOM-created model of a protein turned out to be a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson studies the black beetle virus, a simple pathogen that
infects insects, so that he can better understand more complex
viruses that plague humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viruses have the same problems to solve whether they are HIV
or insect viruses,'' Johnson explains, ``and this one is very easy
to work with because it has only two genes.''
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years of careful work, Johnson thought that he and his
colleagues completely understood the black beetle virus. They knew,
for example, that 180 identical copies of one protein linked
together to form the virus' geodesic dome-shaped outer capsule,
they knew how those links were forged and they could program a
computer to show it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Johnson handed his data over to Bailey, who then built
nine copies of the protein, each 20 million times actual size. When
Johnson got his hands on the protein models, he assembled three
into a clump, just as they assemble themselves in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning the proteins over in his hands, Johnson saw a hole
where the three molecules met. In all his years of studying the
proteins, this hole had eluded him. Computer graphics couldn't give
him enough sense of depth to notice it.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Johnson saw the hole in the model, he recognized that
it was a perfect fit for a peglike protrusion on another surface of
the three-protein chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an alignment just like you would align things if you
were fitting together pieces of wood,'' Johnson says, ``and we
hadn't realized it. We didn't even know we had missed it. Now it is
possible to design small molecules that can fit into that hole and
block the assembly of the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   LOM begins building an object by creating the bottom-most layer.
Paper fed off a roll is glued to a metal platform inside the LOM,
and a carbon-dioxide laser then traces an outline on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Any paper lying outside the outline then gets crosshatched by
the laser, and the metal platform drops down a fraction of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of paper is then rolled out on top of the first
layer, and as they are heated to 400 degrees, the two layers fuse.
The laser now cuts a new outline for the second layer.
</P>
<P>
   The machine repeats this process hundreds or thousands of times,
and when the last layer has been rolled and cut, Bailey can pay the
model off the platform with a putty knife.
</P>
<P>
   The model is a solid block, but the crosshatched areas
surrounding the object fall away easily. The smaller pieces wedged
into cracks and crevices can be fished out with tools that look
like dental picks.
</P>
<P>
   The process can take anywhere from a few hours, for simple
models like the human heart in Bailey's office, to more than a day
for complicated molecules like the black beetle virus protein.
</P>
<P>
   Because the scorched edges of the paper form the exterior
surfaces of the parts, the finished product has the appearance of
aged wood, which can be accentuated by a coat of lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Dru Clark, a graduate student at the University
of California at San Diego, Bailey has created hundreds of models.
Some are exotic: topographical maps of the seafloor and Venus, a
swirling hurricane. Others are traditional manufacturing models,
like gears and aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
   The data for building these models generally come to Bailey's
office over the Internet. Before a model can be built, though, the
data must be translated into a geometric representation of the
object's surface _ a mesh of as many as 600,000 tiny triangles.
</P>
<P>
   The translation isn't always smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the computer graphics on the screen
doesn't care about solidity,'` Bailey says ``You can do all kinds
of things with graphics and the computer will happily draw it up
because you are simply modeling appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can build only those physical objects that can exist in
three dimensions. There here are mathematical rules that must be
followed. If a gap is hiding in the data, for example, it can
become a crack in the model.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a crack, the machine can get confused about what
is inside and what is outside,'' Bailey says. ``For instance, if I
drew a circle on a piece of paper and asked you what was inside,
well, that's easy. But what if I drew an arc? What is inside? I
don't know. It could be the area on the bottom of the line, or it
could be the area on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has built a program that will let his computer
automatically check data for these sort of errors, with the
ultimate goal of making the LOM produce finished models without his
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   These subtleties of turning strings of ones and zeros into a
piece of sculpture are pretty much lost on the researchers who send
Bailey their data files, but he doesn't mind their indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientists don't want to know, they just want the model.
They are only interested in the science,'' Bailey says. ``And that
is the purpose of the project _ scientists don't have to be
mathematicians or engineers.''

looked at it on a flat computer screen,'' Bailey says. ``We're
trying to figure out why, but my hunch is that it has something to
do with the way your eye can vary its focus on a solid model.''
</P>
<P>
   For John Johnson, a structural biologist at the Scripps Research
Institute, a LOM-created model of a protein turned out to be a
revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson studies the black beetle virus, a simple pathogen that
infects insects, so that he can better understand more complex
viruses that plague humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Viruses have the same problems to solve whether they are HIV
or insect viruses,'' Johnson explains, ``and this one is very easy
to work with because it has only two genes.''
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years of careful work, Johnson thought that he and his
colleagues completely understood the black beetle virus. They knew,
for example, that 180 identical copies of one protein linked
together to form the virus' geodesic dome-shaped outer capsule,
they knew how those links were forged and they could program a
computer to show it.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Johnson handed his data over to Bailey, who then built
nine copies of the protein, each 20 million times actual size. When
Johnson got his hands on the protein models, he assembled three
into a clump, just as they assemble themselves in nature.
</P>
<P>
   Then, turning the proteins over in his hands, Johnson saw a hole
where the three molecules met. In all his years of studying the
proteins, this hole had eluded him. Computer graphics couldn't give
him enough sense of depth to notice it.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as Johnson saw the hole in the model, he recognized that
it was a perfect fit for a peglike protrusion on another surface of
the three-protein chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an alignment just like you would align things if you
were fitting together pieces of wood,'' Johnson says, ``and we
hadn't realized it. We didn't even know we had missed it. Now it is
possible to design small molecules that can fit into that hole and
block the assembly of the virus.''
</P>
<P>
   LOM begins building an object by creating the bottom-most layer.
Paper fed off a roll is glued to a metal platform inside the LOM,
and a carbon-dioxide laser then traces an outline on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Any paper lying outside the outline then gets crosshatched by
the laser, and the metal platform drops down a fraction of an inch.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of paper is then rolled out on top of the first
layer, and as they are heated to 400 degrees, the two layers fuse.
The laser now cuts a new outline for the second layer.
</P>
<P>
   The machine repeats this process hundreds or thousands of times,
and when the last layer has been rolled and cut, Bailey can pay the
model off the platform with a putty knife.
</P>
<P>
   The model is a solid block, but the crosshatched areas
surrounding the object fall away easily. The smaller pieces wedged
into cracks and crevices can be fished out with tools that look
like dental picks.
</P>
<P>
   The process can take anywhere from a few hours, for simple
models like the human heart in Bailey's office, to more than a day
for complicated molecules like the black beetle virus protein.
</P>
<P>
   Because the scorched edges of the paper form the exterior
surfaces of the parts, the finished product has the appearance of
aged wood, which can be accentuated by a coat of lacquer.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of Dru Clark, a graduate student at the University
of California at San Diego, Bailey has created hundreds of models.
Some are exotic: topographical maps of the seafloor and Venus, a
swirling hurricane. Others are traditional manufacturing models,
like gears and aircraft parts.
</P>
<P>
   The data for building these models generally come to Bailey's
office over the Internet. Before a model can be built, though, the
data must be translated into a geometric representation of the
object's surface _ a mesh of as many as 600,000 tiny triangles.
</P>
<P>
   The translation isn't always smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the computer graphics on the screen
doesn't care about solidity,'` Bailey says ``You can do all kinds
of things with graphics and the computer will happily draw it up
because you are simply modeling appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But you can build only those physical objects that can exist in
three dimensions. There here are mathematical rules that must be
followed. If a gap is hiding in the data, for example, it can
become a crack in the model.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a crack, the machine can get confused about what
is inside and what is outside,'' Bailey says. ``For instance, if I
drew a circle on a piece of paper and asked you what was inside,
well, that's easy. But what if I drew an arc? What is inside? I
don't know. It could be the area on the bottom of the line, or it
could be the area on top.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey has built a program that will let his computer
automatically check data for these sort of errors, with the
ultimate goal of making the LOM produce finished models without his
supervision.
</P>
<P>
   These subtleties of turning strings of ones and zeros into a
piece of sculpture are pretty much lost on the researchers who send
Bailey their data files, but he doesn't mind their indifference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scientists don't want to know, they just want the model.
They are only interested in the science,'' Bailey says. ``And that
is the purpose of the project _ scientists don't have to be
mathematicians or engineers.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For 139 years, ever since its delicate bones and feathers were
found splayed on a limestone slab in a German quarry, Archaeopteryx
has had the distinction of being the most primitive bird known.
</P>
<P>
   Its clawed wings, toothy beak and long bony tail, most
paleontologists now believe, show the transformation of a lineage
of bipedal dinosaurs into birds.
</P>
<P>
   Since its discovery, the 145-million-year-old Archaeopteryx has
perched alone on a low branch of the avian evolutionary tree.
</P>
<P>
   Now the old bird finally has company. In March, paleontologists
described a 65- to 70-million-year-old bird from Madagascar, which,
though younger than Archaeopteryx, is almost as primitive. In life
it would have resembled a little winged Velociraptor.
</P>
<P>
   Paleontologists found the fossil in a quarry in northwestern
Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sampson of New York College of Osteopathic Medicine in Old
Westbury, N.Y., came across a wing bone embedded in rock.
Suspecting that more of the skeleton might be hidden in the rock,
he dug around the bone and shipped a yard-long block to the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, where the fossils could be
carefully extracted.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the wing bone, the researchers thought they had a
relatively ordinary bird (it even had nodes on one edge where
feathers were once lodged) _ until they uncovered the tail. Modern
birds have a stub to anchor a fan of feathers; the Madagascar bird
had a bony tail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just looked really primitive,'' says Catherine Forster of
Stony Brook. ``I remember a preparator was working on the foot, and
I joked that wouldn't it be funny if the foot had a big sickle
claw?''
</P>
<P>
   She was remembering that in the 1970s John Ostrom of Yale had
suggested that birds were closely related to dromaeosaurs,
predatory dinosaurs with giant sickle claws on their feet. This
group included dinosaurs such as Deinonychus and Velociraptor,
which probably disemboweled prey with their claws.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Archaeopteryx had evolved, most paleontologists
assumed, this weapon had dwindled to an ordinary bird claw.
</P>
<P>
   After she made her joke, Forster left the lab to teach an
anatomy class. Half an hour later a colleague called from the lab
to tell her that the bird did indeed have an inch-long sickle claw.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers recovered part of the bird's tail and spine, the
pelvis, much of its legs, parts of its arms and a shoulder blade.
</P>
<P>
   To determine its closest relatives, Forster compared it with
seven birds and eight dinosaurs, using a computer to calculate the
simplest evolutionary pattern that could produce their anatomic
similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Her analysis showed that the Madagascar bird was nearly as
primitive as Archaeopteryx, possibly located on the same side
branch of bird evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Forster and her colleagues have named the bird Rahonavis
ostromi.
</P>
<P>
   ```Rahona' is a Malagasy word,'' Forster says, ``with a double
meaning: 'cloud' and 'menace.' We thought it was a good name for a
flying killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Forster also honored Ostrom with the name because the fossil
further supports the bird-dinosaur connection.
</P>
<P>
   Although most paleontologists subscribe to Ostrom's ideas today,
there are critics. Some argue that dinosaurs lost their fourth and
fifth fingers while birds are missing their first and fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Still others have looked at dinosaur fossils found recently in
China and have argued that they had crocodile-like lungs radically
unlike those of birds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to Forster and others, the many primitive bird and birdlike
dinosaur fossils found recently in Spain, China and Argentina
bolster Ostrom's theory.
</P>
<P>
   Rahonavis, Forster says, is a particularly strong link in the
chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a primitive bird, it looks almost exactly like
Archaeopteryx, and it has a dromaeosaur foot, which is a pretty
clear link to its dinosaur origins.''

 &HT;    BellSouth wedded to phone lines for its Net access
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth.Net and its sister telephone companies
offering Internet access have unique problems to deal with as
technology slowly but steadily advances toward cable modems and
high-speed access. Their options are limited by reliance on the
telephone network. Whether that will help or hurt long term is
still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, AT&AMP;T, which also operates Internet service
provider WorldNet, had no choice but to place its bets on the
high-speed promises of ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line)
telephony technology. However, the merger with Tele-Communications
Inc. provides it with cable modem technology as well as potential
access to 67 million homes. But because AT&AMP;T is also a
telecommunications provider, it can also continue developing an
ADSL strategy.
</P>
<P>
   As MindSpring President and Chief Operating Officer Michael
McQuary notes, it's important for an ISP to be light on its feet.
``I think you've got to constantly be on a course for multiple
strategies,'' he says. ``You've got to stay light on your feet and
be able to change directions on a moment's notice.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it's not possible for BellSouth.Net, the region's
second-largest ISP, to change directions in the same manner.
Because of its connection to BellSouth, it is firmly tied to ADSL.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth.Net president Ray Smets believes when consumers begin
to make decisions about high-speed Internet access, they'll want
the phone company to provide that service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fair amount of good public response to the kinds of
goods and service we are planning to deploy,'' Smets says. ``In
fact, the response has astounded us.''
</P>
<P>
   Smets calls BellSouth's plans for ADSL ``very aggressive.'' He
says there are 1.8 million homes currently qualified for high-speed
access and that the company will market the service to those homes
throughout 1999. ``Broadband will definitely impact our business in
the future,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Smets agrees with analysts and others in the ISP business and
says the marketplace has to mature before consumers will actively
seek out high-speed access. ``First you have to get them online,
then you have to graduate them to the advantages of high-speed
access.''
</P>
<P>
   He says the main advantage of BellSouth.Net in the long run is
its ability to provide all kinds of access from telephone dial-up
to high-speed ADSL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will graduate people into ADSL,'' he says. ``Not everybody
needs broadband when they first go online. Over time, we will see a
migration toward broadband. ADSL has an incredible amount of
industry backing. Customers can buy ADSL modems packaged in their
computers and it has a lifespan of decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Smets says he wants to keep his options open, those
options are limited to broadband or dial-up phone service. The
future of BellSouth.Net and other ISPs operated by phone companies
depends on the success of ADSL.

 &HT;    Test Drive: In the Chevy S-10 truck, three's not a crowd
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's not going to happen, but wouldn't it be nice if
all pickups came with extended cabs and a third door? Of course,
there'll always be buyers for two-door, regular-cab models, but
it's amazing how much convenience and utility the extra space and
door add, particularly to a compact like the Chevrolet S-10.
</P>
<P>
   Comparison drives between the bright red test vehicle with
optional V-6 engine and four-speed automatic transmission and a
black regular cab with the standard four-cylinder engine and
five-speed manual transmission were conclusive: Both are useful and
practical, but the extended cab and third door significantly
improve everything but the price (roughly $11,000 base price for
the standard truck; about $15,000 for the larger cab).
</P>
<P>
   Compared with most other options offered, Chevrolet's
driver's-side third door is a bargain at $295. Other option prices
on the tester, which totaled $21,167, included $710 for power
mirrors, locks and windows and $395 for a tilt wheel and cruise
control. Load some work-related items, haul a few groceries or put
a third occupant on the extended cab jump seat, and you'll
understand why more than half of the plus-cab S-10s sold have a
third door.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison drives also proved that, yes, the 175-horsepower
V-6 engine is preferable to the 120-hp four-cylinder, but is the
extra power worth the loss of 3 to 5 miles per gallon in fuel
economy? Remember, most buyers don't make serious beasts of burden
of compact trucks. They're for what the industry calls ``personal
use,'' not for some other use, whatever that might be.
</P>
<P>
   When put to personal use, the S-10 is not carlike in its ride,
handling and overall comfort level, but both versions were
reasonably quiet, had excellent ergonomics because of a dash
redesign for '98 and sported adequate seating. Minuses include the
leg- and ankle-bumping seat adjustment handle that sticks straight
up on the outboard front of the bottom cushion and a shifter-clutch
pairing on the four-cylinder that demands familiarity. Unloaded,
both trucks entertained occupants with wheel hops on bumps and
other irregular pavement, and there's no reason to expect the
extended cab S-10's optional sport suspension package ($455) to do
anything but harden the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Positives include good visibility, drink holders molded into the
door pockets, not-so-cheap-appearing plastic and cloth in the cabin
and good headlamps (also new for '99) that automatically go from
daytime running lights to full-beam status as visibility vanishes.
The new passenger-side air bag is switchable, and all S-10s come
with power anti-lock disc brakes.
</P>
<P>
   As the sales numbers (expected to be about 240,000 units this
year) and average price ($16,300) of the S-10s sold indicate,
Chevy's neat little compact has a lot going for it, and all of it
is far more enjoyable and useful when there's an extended cab and a
third door.

 &HT;    Waco bat maker etches out Heisman for Williams
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Ricky Williams returns this fall as the nation's
leading rusher in college football, but his chances of winning the
Heisman Trophy are hardly etched in stone.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, no. Ash hardwood, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Sellers is the guy doing the etching. According to the Waco
pharmacist, a part-time maker of baseball trophy bats, Williams
will win the Heisman. Says so right there in black and white. Black
script and white ash on a 33-inch, 27- ounce bat that has Williams'
authentic signature laser-engraved alongside a Longhorns logo. The
words ``1998 Heisman Trophy winner'' will be emblazoned on the
barrel.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Peyton Manning was supposed to win the 1997 Heisman
and Notre Dame's Ron Powlus one or two before that, so it might not
be a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, no bat would have a sweeter spot than Williams'
custom-made model. For now, the University of Texas senior-to-be is
working more on his .347 batting average and eight-game hitting
streak for the Philadelphia Phillies' Class A baseball club, the
Batavia Muckdogs of the New York-Penn League, than he is his
football skills.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is certainly Sellers' favorite to become the first
running back to win the Heisman since Eddie George in 1995. But
that's because Sellers, a 37- year-old graduate of the UT School of
Pharmacy, is a longtime Longhorn fan, whose citizens band handle
was ``Bevo'' until it was recently converted to ``Batman'' for
obvious reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers called former Texas running backs coach Bucky Godbolt to
get in touch with his protege and actually spoke to Williams, who
was thrilled to have his own personalized bat. Williams wasn't the
least bit worried about being jinxed, maybe because he thinks he'll
be allowed to carry it with him out of the huddle.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sellers is an unabashed Williams fan, he did gig the
Longhorns back about switching jerseys from No. 11 to No. 34
because his three kids had to have both souvenir jerseys. ``He's
going to break me,'' Sellers said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' special order is one of more than 100 trophy bats that
Sellers has fashioned since December 1995. He plans to present the
light-colored bat with the natural grain finish to Williams at an
August football practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite a coup for me,'' beamed Sellers, who in November
will officially petition major-league baseball to become a licensed
bat maker and would love to win contracts from some marquee
major-leaguers. ``I'm not trying to put anybody out of business.
I'm small-time. My wife always reminds me, `Rob, you're a
pharmacist.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the higher-profile Louisville Slugger and Easton
manufacturers, it might become a case of Sellers, beware. However,
at this point, Sellers even orders some of his wood from the
Kentucky bat maker.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers, a Little League catcher from Conroe, has been adept at
woodworking since his high school days. Some 12 years ago, he
started making furniture such as coffee tables and a roll-top desk
for his family but graduated to bat making 2 1/2 years ago after a
friend got him a great deal on a mint-condition wood lathe for $175
at a Houston Independent School District auction.
</P>
<P>
   The roll-top took him 11 months. Bats, he can turn around more
quickly. He has become so accomplished, he has cut in half the time
it takes to cut, groove, sand, rub and polish a bat and can turn
out a finished product in two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers has even taken to naming his bats like the 37-ounce
``Big Bertha'' that he can barely pick up. Where's Mark McGwire
when you need him?
</P>
<P>
   Then there's ``Uncle Sam,'' born on July 4. It has an added
patriotic touch of a red, white and blue stripe. ``Billy Bob,''
named for Sellers' father, William Robert Sellers, was created on
July 7, his dad's birthday. He's even re- created the red-stained
Pete Rose model to replace his buddy's favorite bat that Sellers
broke in high school.
</P>
<P>
   The artist has been featured in newspaper stories as well as the
``Texas Tales'' television show. But his disappointment was
palpable when one reporter showed up for an interview and never
once picked up, swung or even sniffed the aroma of one of Sellers'
bats. Guy probably liked the DH, too.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers has sold about 55 of his specialties, almost as many as
he has given away to friends. Corey Bush, the Robinson
pitcher-outfielder who was named player of the year on a Super
Centex team, has one. So does Chase Mann, Rosebud-Lott's rookie
coach and coach of the year in the Waco area.
</P>
<P>
   What baseball fanatic wouldn't want one? I can still remember
the soothing feel of the amber-colored Henry Aaron model my parents
brought me from their summer trip to Sioux City, Iowa. Some things
you just don't forget.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers' works of art are showing up everywhere from sports bars
to the office of the business editor of the Waco Herald-Tribune. It
is such a labor of love that he has difficulty putting a price on
his creations. Nevertheless, they go for $99.95, plus tax. Batting
tips not included.
</P>

 &HT;    ConsumerWatch: Cooling-Off Rule often not what buyers believe it
is
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The federal Cooling-Off Rule, passed by Congress in
1972 to protect vulnerable consumers from unscrupulous door-to-door
salespeople, is one of the nation's best consumer laws. But it
still remains one of the most misunderstood, which often causes
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely a week passes that we don't receive calls from readers
who say they have purchased some item, usually a car, and they want
to return it. ``Don't I have three days to change my mind?'' they
ask.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the answer is no _ and nearly always no with the
purchase of a car, unless the seller agreed to a return period,
which some dealers have begun doing in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooling-Off Rule gives you three business days to cancel
many purchases made at your home, apartment, dormitory or
workplace, or a location that's not the seller's permanent place of
business, such as convention centers, fairgrounds, restaurants and
temporarily rented hotel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But there are numerous exceptions. The Cooling-Off Rule does not
cover sales that:
</P>
<P>
   _ Are under $25.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are made entirely by mail or telephone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are the result of previous negotiations at the seller's
permanent place of business where the goods are regularly sold.
</P>
<P>
   _ Are made as part of your request to do repairs or maintenance
on your home.
</P>
<P>
   Also exempt from the Cooling-Off Rule are sales that involve:
</P>
<P>
   _ Real estate, insurance or securities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Autos, trucks and other motor vehicles sold at temporary
locations, provided the seller has a permanent place of business.
</P>
<P>
   _ Arts or crafts sold at fairs or locations such as shopping
malls and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the Cooling-Off Rule, the federal Truth-in-Lending Law
gives borrowers a three-day ``recision period'' to cancel a
personal loan for which their home is collateral. In addition, some
states mandate cancellation periods for certain purchases
regardless of where they are made. Georgia, for example, requires
health club contracts to have a seven-day cancellation period.
</P>
<P>
   But as many shoppers have learned to their dismay, no federal
law regulates the merchandise return policies of retailers. What
items stores accept for return, refund or exchange is pretty much
up to each store to decide. Fortunately, most retailers usually
accept returns to keep customers happy.

 &HT;    Cyberscene: Get informed about heat-related ills
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just about the coolest thing a person can do on the
Internet at this time of the year is to find ways to get out of the
heat.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of Web sites that suggest ways to stay cool
during the hot summer.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop is at the Atlanta-based Weather Channel site at
http://www.weather.com. That organization has a special site at
http://www.weather.com
</P>
<P>
   /safeside/heat/ devoted to dealing with the heat.
</P>
<P>
   You'll learn right away that staying cool in the extreme heat is
more than just a way of being comfortable. It can save your life.
You are reminded, high up on the page, that: ``In 1995, extreme
heat contributed to the deaths of almost 500 people in Chicago. And
that same year, it killed more people in the United States than all
other natural disasters combined.''
</P>
<P>
   So pay attention as you follow the well-thought-out links on
this page. At the click of your mouse, you can be whisked to areas
that tell you what you can do to stay cool (and safe) during a heat
wave; how to determine if your age or physical condition put you at
special risk; and how to prepare for a heat emergency.
</P>
<P>
   While sunburns aren't as serious as a heatstroke, they are very
common in the South. And since long exposure to the sun can
increase your risk of skin cancer, it's worth your time to learn
about protecting your skin from serious burns. So before we leave
the excellent Weather Channel site, let's drop in at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .weather.com/health/sunpro
</P>
<P>
   .html.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find out about sunscreens and lotions, but _ for those
who want to be really scientific about fighting the sun _ you can
also follow a link from this page to learn how to read the Weather
Channel's ultraviolet forecast maps that show the intensity of
these rays in different parts of the country. The UV ratings _
which start at zero and go to levels beyond 10 _ can call for
protection as simple as wearing a hat (at levels of 2 or below) to
staying inside if you can (when levels are 10 or higher).
</P>
<P>
   Our next site also originates in Atlanta. It's from the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention. The page, called ``Extreme Heat
_ A Prevention Guide to Promote Your Personal Health and Safety''
can be found at http://www.cdc
</P>
<P>
   .gov/nceh/programs/emergenc
</P>
<P>
   /prevent/heat/heat.htm. While the information isn't as
well-organized as what's offered by the Weather Channel, you will
find links from this page to topic areas that offer the same sort
of common-sense advice you got from your mother. For instance, you
are told to drink plenty of fluids, pace yourself when working in
the heat and to wear appropriate clothing. While most people who
have enough sense to come in from the heat already know these
things, you'll find plenty of details and tips that may come as a
surprise. For instance, it's smart _ on a really hot day _ to avoid
extremely cold beverages since the contrast in the temperatures can
actually produce a harmful shock to your system in some instances.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Federal Emergency Management Agency site, the last
heat-related page on our tour of hot sites says that even a cool
shower after coming inside from hot temperatures can ``result in
hypothermia, particularly for elderly and very young people.''
</P>
<P>
   So even common sense can fail you in hot weather. But, as long
as you're inside in air-conditioned comfort surfing the Web, you're
safe from even the hottest day.

 &HT;    Commentary: Airlines always keep an eye on their bottom line
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Airline executives respond to questions about
government regulation the way the Scarecrow gave directions to
Dorothy after she landed in Oz. They point in two opposite
directions at once.
</P>
<P>
   When airline honchos think regulations might help consumers,
they point vigorously toward libertarianism. But if the regulations
help their profits, they point toward legislation.
</P>
<P>
   This month, industry leaders displayed their schizophrenic
tendencies while trying to influence Congress. Their libertarian
side came out as they fiercely lobbied the House Transportation
Committee to kill government guidelines to curb predatory pricing.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, proposed in April by Transportation Secretary
Rodney Slater, would allow the government to levy fines whenever it
finds a major airline trying to snuff out a small carrier by
flooding the market with cheap seats.
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 years since airlines were deregulated, the government
has not been involved in determining fares. But Slater said his
department needs the power to stop big airlines from ``dumping''
unfairly priced seats.
</P>
<P>
   But his proposal got the major carriers complaining that the
guidelines would limit their pricing flexibility and be a step
toward re-regulation. Republican leaders agreed and last week
pushed the House Transportation Committee to delay implementation
of the guidelines for months while the matter is studied by the
National Academy of Sciences' Transportation Research Board.
</P>
<P>
   The major carriers' anti-DOT position was in keeping with a
grand pronouncement made by Carol Hallett, president of the Air
Transport Association, the industry's trade group. Last year, in an
address to hundreds of Wall Street analysts, Hallett attacked
regulations, saying, ``Everywhere we turn, we face the government's
heavy hand.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if the major airlines could get that heavy hand to help
them with the luggage? Well that's another matter.
</P>
<P>
   This month Delta Air Lines testified before the House Aviation
Subcommittee, urging Congress to pass the ``Carry-On Baggage
Reduction Act.''
</P>
<P>
   Should Congress be in the business of telling individuals how
big their purses can be or whether a diaper bag is baggage?
</P>
<P>
   Yes sir, according to Delta. But why is this a job for
government? The Atlanta-based carrier already has instituted a
two-bag limit to prevent travelers from hauling on board their
steamer trunks. The policy is a good one: Overstuffed bins are
dangerous and they slow the boarding process.
</P>
<P>
   But some of Delta's less-prosperous competitors don't have such
tough carry-on policies. They have emptier planes and therefore
more room in their overhead bins. On slow days, they might allow a
business traveler to hop onto a plane with a garment bag, a
carry-on suitcase and a laptop computer and a purse.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way a free market is supposed to work: Each carrier
does what it can to attract customers. Delta, which has problems
with flight delays, needs a strict carry-on rule to speed up
boarding. Small carriers, which have fewer occupied seats, may need
a relaxed carry-on rule to please customers.
</P>
<P>
   But why face competition when you can get government to
eliminate the pressure for you? If Congress were to pass the
``Carry-On Baggage Reduction Act,'' then small airlines would lose
an advantage they have over big ones.
</P>
<P>
   The major airlines may seem confused about government's role in
their industry, but their position actually is quite consistent:
Any regulation that protects consumers is a violation of the free
market, and any regulation that protects them from start-up
carriers is good public policy.

 &HT;    Mac News: Excel makes better use of Mac's innovations
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the uninitiated, Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet
program has always been an 800-pound gorilla _ powerful and
intimidating.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, because the program can be very useful if you're
not scared off by its impenetrable appearance and seemingly endless
list of features.
</P>
<P>
   In Excel 98, the latest version, Microsoft's programmers wisely
switched strategy. Instead of adding yet more functions, they
focused on making Excel easier to use and understand.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a program that, while still at times overwhelming,
is greatly improved. Here's a look at some of the more important
changes.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of my list is 16 levels of undo and redo. Many users
have long been reluctant to try Excel's powerful functions, fearing
a mistake would mess up their stock portfolio or home finances. Now
you can go back or forward 16 steps at a time. Nearly any misstep
can be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Excel now also lets you quickly check a formula analyzing a set
of numbers. For starters, there's a feature called AutoCorrect,
which automatically identifies and corrects 15 of the most common
formula errors.
</P>
<P>
   You can also double-click a spreadsheet cell with a formula, and
Excel will highlight any data involved in it. That way you can
quickly check to see if you've included the right numbers for the
calculation.
</P>
<P>
   Another nifty improvement is the ability to name in English a
cell or range of cells. You can, for example, name a row of figures
``June sales.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes work easier yet, because then you can use that named
range of cells in a formula instead of typing in an arcane list of
cell addresses. For example, you could write a formula that says
``June sales minus June expenses.'' Now isn't that easier than
typing A4:B6 - C3:C8?
</P>
<P>
   Excel now includes lots of formula templates, easily accessible
from the upper left corner of any spreadsheet. Select one of these
templates and plug in your own cells or numbers. You can also cut
and paste parts of the templates to form formulas of your own.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Microsoft had ignored Apple Computer's
innovations in the Mac versions of its software. Excel 98 reverses
this practice. It reflects the new look of OS 8 and its
improvements, including contextual menus, drag-and-drop and sticky
menus. You can also easily link data between documents.
</P>
<P>
   You can buy Excel as a stand-alone product for $399 (the upgrade
is $149) or get it as part of Office 98. It's a suite of programs
that includes Word, Outlook and Proponent in addition to Excel.
Office retails for $499 (the upgrade is $299).

 &HT;    Dominican Republic's favorite sons give nearly as much as they
get
 &HT;    By Cheryl Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Jesus Martinez is jealous of his
brothers not because they are famous big-league pitchers but
because of the money success brings them.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a greedy young man. The millions he craves are not for
himself. He doesn't want a fancy car or diamond jewelry or a
stylish wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, he sees what his older brothers contribute to their
hometown of Mano Guayabo in the Dominican Republic and he feels
left out.
</P>
<P>
   When Pedro, 26, and Ramon Martinez, 30, return home, they are
celebrated like the prodigal sons. It is a holiday. They are tugged
and pulled as every child wants just to touch, to get a piece of
the brothers for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the older brothers have given more than simply time.
They have built a church and their next project is to build a
school.
</P>
<P>
   They wear their fame like a comfortable sweater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great about them, but I'll feel better if I could help
a little bit,'' said Jesus, a 24-year-old who is with the
Cincinnati Reds' Class AAA team. ``I can be there, because I'm
their brother, but I can't (contribute) because I have nothing.
That sometimes gets me a little upset, not because of what they do,
but because I can't give what they give.'' Pedro Martinez won his
first Cy Young Award last season with the Montreal Expos. He was
then traded to the Boston Red Sox after the expansion draft, and
signed a six-year, $75million deal.
</P>
<P>
   He is 10-2, with a 3.02 ERA and 137 strikeouts in 119 innings
after Friday's win against the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   It is the third major-league team for Pedro. All three began
their professional careers with the Los Angeles Dodgers, with whom
Ramon still pitches, although he will miss the rest of the season
after he has rotator cuff surgery Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But Pedro insists he's the same person who grew up in a wooden
house, with nothing but food to eat and the shoes he needed to wear
to school. That is why he pours so much of his time and money back
into his home. He wants to celebrate, not forget, where he came
from.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the footsteps, literally, of Ramon, who is 3 1/2
years older. Pedro would follow him to the Dodgers academy in Campo
Las Palmas when Ramon signed in 1984. He would carry Ramon's bags,
but he really went just to see the fields, to be part of the game.
Sometimes, he'd catch Ramon. Then Ramon would catch him, and
eventually, that's how Pedro got noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro would challenge everyone and anyone to throw from center
field to home plate. He wanted to be on those fields every minute
of every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a crush on baseball,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Pedro was 14, his fastball was in the high-70s. Two
years later, he was signed by the Dodgers. He owes everything to
Ramon.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the open door for us to pass through,'' Pedro said.
``He did everything for us. I have a lot to appreciate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon won 20 games in a season and threw a no-hitter during his
eight full seasons with Los Angeles. He always felt responsible for
setting a good example for his family. One of his lessons was
teaching his brothers how to be competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro embraced competition with a bear hug. He wanted to win
every race, every fight, every moment. He also always was the
instigator in the family. He'd hoist his mother, Lopoldina, on his
back and run around the house. He'd pull Ramon's ears.
</P>
<P>
   He loves music and dancing and joking and laughter. Ramon and
Jesus are much more quiet. There is only room for one clown. But
there is more than enough space for more than one star.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon and Pedro used to talk when they were little kids about
what they would do if they ever made it to the major leagues. Their
first plan was to buy a big house for their family.
</P>
<P>
   Family means the most.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro brought everyone together this spring for Ramon's 30th
birthday March 22. Ramon pitched that day, and afterward received a
call from teammate Ismael Valdes _ who said he needed Ramon to bail
him out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon, obviously concerned, drove down to the courthouse in Vero
Beach, where the Dodgers train. He realized the hoax when there,
among his entire family and good friends, was a sweet red Ferrari,
a gift from Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just buy what I need and I help my family,'' Pedro said.
``I'm very, very normal.''
</P>
<P>
   They always knew they'd give back to the community. They
distribute discarded shoes from their teammates and give food and
toys to families at the holidays. They figure if other players see
what they do, they'll want to give, too.
</P>
<P>
   There were a lot of people in the town who knew Ramon had
ability when he signed. They were happy for him, but also said
money would change him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably I changed a little,'' Ramon said. ``But I haven't
changed the way I treat them.''
</P>
<P>
   The brothers believe more in people than in money. They built a
church first because it was the way to show their town God helps
and if you believe strongly, dreams can come true like theirs did.
</P>
<P>
   They have lived both lives, of the rich and of the poor, and if
they are not a bridge, then at least they can be messengers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps me understand how people think and how they feel,''
Pedro said of experiencing poverty and wealth. For Jesus, baseball
</P>
<P>
   was almost an afterthought. He wasn't a field rat like Pedro, he
wasn't leading the way like Ramon. He really got into the sport
when Pedro signed. That could be why his progress appears slower.
</P>
<P>
   He signed with the Dodgers in 1990 when he was 16. But he never
made it above Class AAA and was chosen by the Arizona Diamondbacks
in the expansion draft before being traded to the Florida Marlins
for Devon White. He was then traded as the player-to-be-named to
the Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little tough for him,'' Ramon said. ``It makes him feel
a little pressure because the expectations are very high. Maybe
he's rushing. I told him, `Your time will come.' Besides, lefties,
they survive longer.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. It was great early in spring training this season, with
Jesus at big-league camp with the Marlins in Melbourne, and Ramon
not too far away in Vero Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Jesus wanted anyone's help. It was just nice to have
family near. All three had to learn English when they came to
America, and all were confused and a bit lonely. Pedro was
devastated when he was traded to Montreal after the '93 season. But
he's learned it is part of the game: as much as following Ramon
taught him, it was time to make it on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Jesus is ready for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want me to be the same as they are,'' Jesus said.
``That's what anybody would like for their brother. I just want to
be as good as I can be. I want to be myself.''

 &HT;    Netw(at)atch: franklymydear.com complements movie
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tomorrow is another day.
</P>
<P>
   It's also another day to see the 1939 classic ``Gone With the
Wind'' on the big screen the way it was meant to be seen. A
generation of mothers and grandmothers will be taking their teenage
daughters and granddaughters off to see their generation's
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a generation of daughters and granddaughters can take
the opportunity to check out ``GWTW'' on the World Wide Web and
maybe teach mom and grandma a little bit about cybersurfing at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   The official ``Gone With the Wind'' Web site has an easy address
to remember, http://www.franklymydear.com. ``GWTW'' buffs know this
is Rhett's (Clark Gable) parting shot to Scarlett (Vivien Leigh) at
the movie's end and one of the most memorable and classic lines
ever uttered in film (next to DiCaprio's ``I'm king of the world,''
of course.).
</P>
<P>
   New Line films, the distributor of the newly restored film, has
created a beautiful site, filled with classic photos and trivia. A
special treat is the time line, which gives an amazing
month-by-month account of the making of the movie. Visitors learn
about casting problems, costume problems and the insistence of
African-American cast members that certain words be deleted from
the script. In the '90s, its very trendy for movie companies to put
up Web sites for their films, but this site for the 1939 classic
has to be one of the richest, most informative and beautiful Web
sites ever done to complement a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the film are also fascinated with Margaret Mitchell and
her best-selling novel, on which the movie is based. While visitors
to Atlanta won't be able to find Scarlett's fictional homestead of
Tara (not that this stops them from asking directions), they can
visit the Margaret Mitchell House in person or on the Web at
http://www.gwtw.org. Here, visitors can read up on the woman who
penned the novel.
</P>
<P>
   The house, which is located in Midtown Atlanta, was one of
Mitchell's many homes and the one where she wrote most of ``Gone
With the Wind.'' Mitchell's story is also an interesting step back
into what the world and the South was like in her time. The design
is simple, and there is a lot of reading, but it's good reading.
</P>
<P>
   The Gone with the Wind Online Exhibit (http://www.lib
</P>
<P>
   .utexas.edu/Libs/HRC/HRHRC/DOS/GWTW/GWTW.html) is a project of
the Harry Ransom Humanities Center at the University of Texas at
Austin. It's a wonderful repository of ``GWTW'' memorabilia,
historical documents such as producer David O. Selznick's memo to
Louella Parsons, and pictures of the original costumes, including
the famous ``curtain rod'' dress. The site is elegantly designed
and a fascinating look behind-the-scenes at the making of ``Gone
With the Wind.''

 &HT;    Summer job changed young man's life and Mercedes-Benz, too
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the greatest challenges facing any automaker
today is bringing the right product to market.
</P>
<P>
   Few would argue that Mercedes-Benz is doing an exceptional job:
the E-Class, sporty SLK and M-Class sport-utility vehicle are all
blessed with exceptional customer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Just how does a carmaker make the right decision at the right
time? Many rely on research groups, previous sales data and
managerial skills.
</P>
<P>
   Often it is just a gut feeling. Sometimes they are right,
sometimes wrong. Recently, wrong hasn't appeared in the
Mercedes-Benz vocabulary. Its secret weapon may well be its North
American president, Mike Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is not a typical auto executive, and neither is his
background. After graduating from college, Jackson planned on a law
degree. The purchase of a Mercedes 190 SL in need of repairs
changed his life and, possibly, too, the corporate face of
Mercedes-Benz.
</P>
<P>
   With few mechanical skills, Jackson took a summer job at a
Maryland Mercedes dealer. He found he not only had a knack for
things mechanical, he actually liked the work.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen months later, he was the shop foreman. His affinity for
the job did not go unnoticed. He soon became a factory
trouble-shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a service department couldn't resolve a problem, I'd
better,'' Jackson recalled.
</P>
<P>
   From his dealing with customers on this job, he realized he
enjoyed interaction with people and made a move to corporate
marketing. His family realized a law career was not in the cards.
Jackson had cars, and especially Mercedes-Benz, in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   The chance arose to buy the Mercedes dealership where he had
originally started, and Jackson took it. But he kept telling the
guys in Germany, ``You've got a great product, but you've got to
change the way you do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually Mercedes tired of hearing this, responding, ``If you
know so much, come back to corporate and see if you can do
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson could hardly believe the German automaker was ready to
accept change. ``Then I found out that their idea of change was in
Germany and mine might as well have been on the moon. We were
worlds apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Little by little, Jackson won out, providing a fresh personal
focus on how a luxury carmaker can do business.
</P>
<P>
   Sales figures don't lie. For the first time, in 1997, Mercedes'
sales in the United States topped 100,000 units.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many domestic automakers are considering the
death of coupes and niche hot-rod offerings, Mercedes has brought
to market the slick CLK coupe to compete with 3-Series BMW and
Lexus SC 300 and 400. It has stuffed a potent 302-horsepower V-8
into a subtle C-Class sedan, the AMG C-43. With 0-to-60 mph in 5.9
seconds, Jackson and company realized the C-43 isn't for everyone.
With the help of super tuner AMG, they are bringing in only 500
units per year for the next three years to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't contend to have one car for all people, but we
believe Mercedes-Benz has one model or another that can personally
fit most drivers' needs, desires and wishes,'' Jackson said.

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Old, familiar antenna magical at enhancing
reception
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's hard for technology to shock people anymore. Once
upon a time, folks sat open-mouthed at their first sight of a
television set. When radio was first invented, some people
seriously thought it might be the work of devils. And nowadays we
have computers that can read handwriting, understand human speech
and translate more languages than a platoon of U.N. translators.
</P>
<P>
   So _ compared to all that _ I have my work cut out for me when I
tell you that the most magical technological device that I know is
an antenna. For most of you, an antenna is one of those ugly
aluminum things that once sprouted on rooftops across America. It
was replaced by cable TV and lately, in increasing numbers by the
pizza-sized dish antennas used by satellite TV systems.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why an antenna is such a magic device, think of
how it works. In its simplest form _ maybe one of those whip
antennas you find on portable radios and TVs _ it's no more than a
hunk of metal. There's no need to power it with electricity. Yet it
captures tiny electrical signals broadcast by the radio or TV
station and then translates those signals into music and pictures.
</P>
<P>
   I've spent more than my share of time building antennas because
of my ham radio hobby, sometimes stringing hundreds of feet of wire
between tall trees just so that I could talk and listen to people
around the world. Most of you will never have to embarrass yourself
in front of your neighbors as I have _ using a casting rod in my
back yard trying to get a fishing line over a tree so that I could
use that line to pull a rope over the tree so that I could hoist up
the wire. I'll never forget the way the neighbors peered out their
windows, wondering what kind of fish I hoped to catch in a tall oak
tree.
</P>
<P>
   But now that a lot of us live and work in steel-and-concrete
cages in the form of high-rises and apartment buildings, there are
practical reasons to learn a little about antennas. An
acquaintance, here at the newspaper, complained to me the other day
that her fancy portable shortwave radio couldn't pull in many
stations. And here at the newspaper, you can't pick up many of the
local AM stations.
</P>
<P>
   The problem in both cases isn't the strength of the signals. The
problem was that the buildings themselves _ both at the newspaper
and the place where my friend lives _ were blocking the signal.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the newspaper, we solved the problem by putting up a
simple wire antenna _ the kind you can buy at Radio Shack for about
$10 _ on the roof. Then we used coaxial cable _ that's the same
kind of shielded cable used to pipe in cable TV signals _ to
connect the antenna to the radio.
</P>
<P>
   And that's what I'll do with my friend. The outside antenna
doesn't have to be fancy at all to pick up commercial shortwave
stations or the local AM broadcast. In cases like the ones I
mentioned, the purpose of the antenna isn't to amplify the signal,
it's simply to grab the signal from a point outside the steel cage
and then to pipe that signal inside.
</P>
<P>
   You may be in the same boat. Even some homes have enough wire
and steel in them to make any kind of radio _ shortwave or regular
AM _ pretty feeble. The good thing about this problem is that an
antenna is one of the few technological devices that the average
person can build for himself. Unlike transmitting antennas, the
shape and length of the wire you use isn't all that important (in
fact, with most portable radios, you actually don't want to have
too big of an antenna _ the signal can overload radios built to
work with a whip antenna).
</P>
<P>
   So, whether you're trying to pull in a shortwave station from a
station in Beirut or just listen to the Braves on your broadcast
radio, consider draping a short length of wire out the window and
connecting it to the antenna terminal on your radio.
</P>
<P>
   The theory behind how antennas work is maddeningly complex, but
building them isn't.

 &HT;    Tech Report: Listen up _ minidisc or CD-RW?
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dueling formats _ you know the story.
</P>
<P>
   It could be VHS against Betamax. Or compact discs against vinyl.
Fax vs. e-mail, vs. the Postal Service. Among wireless phones, it
could be traditional cellular against personal communications
services, or analog against digital.
</P>
<P>
   In connecting to the Internet, there is a coming battle between
phone lines called Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Lines, known as
ADSL, and cable modems running over cable lines. And for them to
succeed, they must both overcome the slower but more entrenched
modems.
</P>
<P>
   The formats clash. Sometimes one dies, and sometimes they
coexist. Television did not kill radio _ although both were changed
by the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Music in the past few decades has provided some high-stakes
confrontations _ and plenty of reasons for consumers to place bets
on a winner by spending billions of dollar on a format. And if they
bet on a loser, well, they get to bet all over again.
</P>
<P>
   Before there were CDs, cassettes had to stomp eight-track
players and reel-to-reel. Quadraphonic sound arrived roaring and
expired quietly. Before that, long-playing vinyl records learned to
live with the 45 rpm single. That was, after the LP dealt a
post-World War II death blow to the old 78 rpm.
</P>
<P>
   Now the industry is at it again.
</P>
<P>
   The minidisc is a format that offers users a chance to pick
their own selections. It lets people customize their workout or
driving music. There is a recording deck at home, but the medium
you carry is nice and light, affordable and portable.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds kinda like the cassette, doesn't it? And that is just
what the minidisc makers want to replace. After all, the minidisc
is a digital format, a far superior recording to cassette.
</P>
<P>
   Minidisc, while big in Japan, has never been a smash here. Sony
years ago introduced it to thundering apathy. Not one to be easily
beaten, Sony came back into the market about 18 months ago with a
new version and a marketing blitz. Prices for some minidisc
recorders have fallen since then from $600 to under $500 _ with
some still-cheaper machines to be released this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But the minidisc has a new foe: the rewriteable compact disc.
The CD-RW has some potential advantages _ most obviously, that it
comes in the CD format. But the folks at Sony want you to know that
minidisc is easier to record, smaller and more portable than the
CD-RW. Sony also notes that current CD players cannot play CD-RW,
although any machine that can play CD-RW can play all your other
CDs.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle is still evolving. Both CD-RW and minidisc have
yet to amass the kind of market size that can make all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Among the highest-profile makers of the technology are Philips
(http://www.philips
</P>
<P>
   .com/home.html) and Ricoh (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .ricohdms.com/welcome.html). Another good place to start for
more information about CD-RW and other similar technologies is a
Web site run by Worldspan Communications
(http://www.span.com/shoptext
</P>
<P>
   /c.htm).
</P>
<P>
   For more information about dealers selling the minidisc, call
Sony (1-800-222-SONY). For information about Sony's products, visit
the company Web site (http://www
</P>
<P>
   .sony.com).
</P>
<P>
   High-tech ethics
</P>
<P>
   Computer error? Yeah, sure.
</P>
<P>
   Technology offers choices, and apparently an awful lot of
Americans are choosing to do things with it that are somewhat ....
questionable, including the use of technology as an alibi.
</P>
<P>
   A study shows nearly half of America's workers have ``engaged in
unethical actions'' related to new technologies, according to the
report commissioned by Guardian Life Insurance Co. of America and
State Farm Insurance Cos.
</P>
<P>
   The study was released by the American Society of Chartered Life
Underwriters, the Chartered Financial Consultants and the Ethics
Officer Association.
</P>
<P>
   The second-most-common behavior listed in the study was
``wrongly blaming an error you made on a technological glitch,''
which 14 percent of those surveyed admitted to. Nearly the same
number acknowledged using office equipment to shop on the Internet
and copying company software for home use.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more ominously, nearly 50 percent reported that
technology was causing them increased on-the-job pressure. But
perhaps a lot of answers depend on your definition: More than half
of those responding said playing computer games during work hours
and using e-mail for personal messages was not unethical. By
contrast, 70 percent said using technology to intrude unnecessarily
on privacy was unethical _ for example, paging an employee during
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But the most common confession was one familiar to any Atlanta
commuter: 19 percent of those surveyed said they have created ``a
potentially dangerous situation by using new technologies while
driving.''
</P>
<P>
   Is your computer watching you?
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission has released a report on privacy to
Congress that seems to show the long arm of the Internet reaching
into your home and office.
</P>
<P>
   The report, based on an online survey of 1,400 commercial Web
sites, concluded that upward of 85 percent of Web sites collect
personal information, while only 14 percent provide any notice
about that practice, according to the Electronic Privacy and
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
   The center called the findings proof ``that self-regulation has
been so far unsuccessful.''
</P>
<P>
   The FTC report is available online
(http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/reports.htm). A previous report by the
center, called ``Surfer Beware,'' is also online
(http://www.epic.org
</P>
<P>
   /reports/surfer-beware.html).

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Many frustrations of computing call for the touch of
a poet
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I occasionally meet people who, upon finding that I'm
the guy who fills this space, tell me that they often read it but
rarely understand it, because it's too technical for them.
</P>
<P>
   I seldom know how to reply. I would like to take it as a great
compliment that my prose is presumably so intrinsically riveting
that people habitually read it even though they know they cannot
understand it. However, this smacks of fetishism, of some bizarre
kind of literary masochism. I am reluctant to assist in such
pursuits. Who knows where they might lead?
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, this column is dedicated to the literati among you
who run computers despite an innate loathing of them; consider it
your reward for reading this column even when it bewilders you.
</P>
<P>
   For those more involved in computers than poetry, I should
probably make clear that these are haiku, a form of Japanese verse
made with only three lines, the first usually consisting of five
syllables, the second of seven and the third of five.
</P>
<P>
   I am indebted to Dr. Frank Miller of Greenville, S.C., who sent
them to me, and to a gentleman named Robert Shiarella, who sent
them to Dr. Miller, and to whomever wrote them, wherever he/she may
be. She/he is a true artist.
</P>
<P>
   Three things are certain:
</P>
<P>
   Death, taxes, and lost data.
</P>
<P>
   Guess which has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 has crashed.

 &HT;    Summer jobs mean more than cash
 &HT;    By Cara Tanamachi
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the cool artificial air of Barton Creek
Square Mall, somewhere between the Food Court and The Gap,
17-year-old Sabrina Villasana sits on a stool at an ice cream kiosk
watching shoppers meander by.
</P>
<P>
   A customer strolls up and Villasana springs into action, smiling
and asking in her best saleswoman's voice, ``May I help you,
ma'am?''
</P>
<P>
   It's a phrase she speaks a hundred times an afternoon, just one
part of the 23-hour-a-week ritual known as the Summer Job at the
Mall. More than 3 million teens nationwide work summer jobs _ and
this year, with the nation's lowest unemployment rate in a
generation, more teens may have a better pick of the jobs they want
and it already looks as if more teens are working. In April the
national teen unemployment rate was 13.1 percent, lower than the
15.6 percent unemployment rate of April, 1997, according to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   In pursuit of that elusive freedom that only money brings, older
teens will do everything from peddling Gap jeans and ice cream to
lifeguarding and mowing lawns. But there's more to a summer job
than just money, and several experts say teens can walk away from a
summer job with valuable experience in addition to cash.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Brain, author of ``The Teenager's Guide to the Real
World,'' advises young workers to ask lots of questions _ get to
know the business from the inside out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't simply stand at the register looking bored,'' he said.
``Actively try to learn about the different aspects of the
business. There are millionaires who own their own restaurant
franchises, but it isn't easy to run a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin Gossett, director of development at Junior Achievement
of Central Texas, a nonprofit organization that teaches students
from kindergarten through 12th grade about business, says her
organization encourages teens to find summer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any opportunity you have to learn is beneficial for your
future,'' she said. ``You may not want to flip burgers for a living
forever, but the skills you learn here _ responsibility and
teamwork _ can parlay into other jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Labor, on average, 51.3 percent
of teens work retail summer jobs and 33.8 percent work service
summer jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Teens covet mall jobs, since they pay just above minimum wage,
the workplace is air-conditioned, and the hours are never too early
or too late, said Henry Nguyen, 19, who works at the Sunglass Hut
at Barton Creek Square Mall in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very stressful, like when I waited tables last
summer,'' he said. ``And I think you can learn a lot, especially if
you ask questions and really try to understand how things work.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens not yet old enough to work at the mall might try being
entrepreneurs _ perhaps starting a lawn mowing or babysitting
service, or learning how to create Web sites, Brain said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Quattrociocchi, a national speaker and consultant on work
issues, said teens should be wary of settling for just any job.
</P>
<P>
   ``While working can be helpful, it can also be harmful _ earning
should be connected to learning or it's a bad,'' she said. ``Teens
should look for a job that's the closest to where they want to end
up. If you're not interested in the food business, then don't get a
fast-food job.''
</P>
<P>
   Quattrociocchi said teens can look for fields that interest
them, such as car repair or the record industry, and then seek out
gofer-type jobs or volunteer positions in related companies. That
way, teens are exposed to the career fields they're most interested
in, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now a teen might say, how does a volunteer job help me earn
money?'' Quattrociocchi said. ``Well, you get connected to everyone
working in that field by volunteering. These are the people who
will tell you where the jobs are. Once they can see you care and
have skills, they'll start recommending you for jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing, the experts agree, is not to waste a
summer doing something you hate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's horrible to spend a whole summer being miserable,'' Brain
said. ``And money doesn't make up for misery.''

 &HT;    Beware: Bogus offers aplenty for credit cards
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fraudulent credit card offers are the kudzu vine of
consumer cons. They keep coming back, despite constant efforts to
eradicate them.
</P>
<P>
   Kudzu will thrive almost anywhere where there's a little bit of
dirt. Fraudulent cards thrive on the need for credit _ and
consumers who have difficulty obtaining credit are prime targets
for the bogus offers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month the Federal Trade Commission announced a settlement
with SureCheK Systems, an Atlanta-based firm that allegedly assured
consumers they would receive a credit card, regardless of their
credit history, if they paid $129 upfront.
</P>
<P>
   ``In almost all cases, they failed to provide the cards, and in
others they failed to disclose additional processing and annual
fees,'' the FTC said.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 500 million major credit cards, such as Visa
and MasterCard, circulating in the United States, and tens of
millions of consumers annually receive offers for credit cards. The
vast majority are legitimate, but fraudulent ones keep appearing
around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic ways to spot the real offers from the bogus
ones:
</P>
<P>
   _ With rare exceptions, legitimate offers will be made by a bank
or credit union, not some firm of which you've never heard. Look
out for copycat names that might imply the firm is a bank or credit
union when it's not.
</P>
<P>
   _ There is never a requirement to pay an advance fee to receive
a regular bank credit card. In a few cases, a bank or credit union
offering a secured credit card _ a card for which you establish a
savings account as collateral _ will charge a small application
fee. But never pay an application fee to any firm other than a bank
or credit union for a secured card.

 &HT;    One player provides team with double trouble
 &HT;    By Ron Jackson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ For a natural left-hander, learning to throw
strikes right-handed is about as simple as shooting a basketball in
a strait jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Except, if you are Matt Witt, the 13-year-old who throws a
baseball ambidextrously. One young man, two pitching arms. It's no
mirage.
</P>
<P>
   It's a sight to see when Witt carries around two matching
Rawlings gloves _ one a left-hander's glove, the other a
right-hander's. Some days he is a southpaw pitcher, other days he
is a right-handed pitcher or a right-handed shortstop or
outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is one of the more amazing things I have ever seen,'' said
coach Bill Begley of the Troy, Ohio-based Brown's Bombers who play
in the Dayton Amateur Baseball Commission Class C (16-and-under)
League. ``Matt has a unique ability. In one inning he throws BBs
from the shortstop hole with his right arm; then the next inning he
strikes out batters and closes the game out as a left-handed
pitcher. It's a trip watching how opponents react.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been our problem to figure out how to use him best,''
Begley continued. ``He's a talented kid and he's full of savvy
already.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt of Bethel Twp., who will be a freshman at Bethel High
School, writes, drinks and eats lefthanded, bats lefthanded, plays
golf lefthanded and shoots baskets lefthanded. He currently plays
point guard on the Dayton Metro 14-and-under basketball team that
is headed to the Amateur Athletic Union nationals July 3-10 in
Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-9, 150-pound Witt has almost pitched exclusively
lefthanded this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more comfortable pitching left handed,'' Witt said. ``I
throw basically the same pitches with both arms _ fast ball, curve
and a change. There's a little mental adjustment moving from the
left to right side and it's a little awkward. But I have no
problems with it now. It's still weird, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching mostly in relief, Witt has earned a save with five
strikeouts in three innings. His earned-run average is 2.33 and
opponents are batting .111 against him. He is hitting .576 as a
left-handed batter.
</P>
<P>
   Witt remembers when Montreal Expos pitcher Greg Harris made
history in 1995 against the Cincinnati Reds, throwing both
left-handed and right-handed in the same game. Harris used a
special six-finger, two-thumbed glove that now resides in the
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   The young switch-pitcher would like to purchase a custom-made
six-finger, two-thumbed glove.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I go out to the mound to switch gloves, it costs me a
conference call,'' Begley said. ``Umpires will not allow him to
warm up again.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt's father Harold, a one-time third baseman in the St. Louis
Cardinals organization, remembers once when his son went from
left-hander to right-hander.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opposing coach asked, 'What is the new kid's name
pitching?' I said it's the same kid,'' the elder Witt said. ``He
still didn't comprehend what I said. He asked me again and I told
him. He left shaking his head.''

COMMENTARY: QUESTIONS THAT DEGRADE
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating for all needing to fix category code)   (fb) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sidney Blumenthal, assistant to the president, made his third
appearance before Kenneth Starr's grand jury in Washington last
Thursday. He was asked a question that unwittingly defined the
character of what Starr and his colleagues are doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever discussed with Mrs. Clinton whether the
president has a sex addiction?'' a prosecutor asked. Blumenthal
answered no, adding that the question was outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time Starr's assistants had asked him a
sexual question. Blumenthal decided to tell me about the
experience, as a grand-jury witness may do. (I sought a comment
from the independent counsel's office; but Starr's spokesman,
Charles Bakaly, did not return a call.)
</P>
<P>
   Blumenthal was first called before the grand jury on Feb. 26. He
was asked what he had told reporters in various news organizations
and what they had said to him about Starr and his assistant
prosecutors. He answered those questions.
</P>
<P>
   Then he was asked what President Clinton had said to him about
the Monica Lewinsky matter. Blumenthal declined to answer,
asserting executive privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The White House claim of executive privilege was rejected in the
courts over the next several months, and finally abandoned.
Blumenthal was then called to testify the second time, on June 4.
</P>
<P>
   Hours passed without his being asked the question he had
declined to answer on Feb. 26. Instead the two prosecutors who
questioned him _ Jackie Bennett Jr., Starr's deputy, and Solomon
Wisenberg _ asked about imagined White House meetings to plot
strategy against the independent prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:30 p.m., in their last 10 minutes, the prosecutors asked
Blumenthal the previously unanswered question about what the
president had told him on the Lewinsky matter. Blumenthal replied
that the president had said the same thing he had publicly, that he
did not have a sexual relationship with Lewinsky and had not told
anyone to lie. Blumenthal added that Clinton was a man of
compassion, rooted in his temperament and his religious
convictions.
</P>
<P>
   At that point the prosecutors asked Blumenthal to leave the room
so they could consult. After five minutes he was called back, and
Wisenberg asked him: ``Does the president's religion include sexual
intercourse?''
</P>
<P>
   There was another sexual question in last week's grand-jury
session, conducted by two new prosecutors. It was, ``Does the
president believe that oral sex is sex?'' It was just that _ a
general question not tied to any particular matter.
</P>
<P>
   We have become coarsened in this country. We are too often
indifferent to the claims of privacy, which Justice Brandeis called
``the right most valued by civilized men.'' But have we really gone
so far that prosecutors can appropriately ask an assistant about
his boss' religion and sex life?
</P>
<P>
   I do not think so. I think most prosecutors would regard those
questions with contempt. It is sneering, smart-aleck stuff, the
tone of Clinton-haters on cable television and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not a joke. Blumenthal's lawyer, William McDaniel, who
has 20 years of experience as a defense counsel in Washington and
elsewhere, put it: ``This is a serious matter. These men and women
(on the independent counsel staff) represent the prosecutorial
power of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have enormous power. Inside the grand jury room,
with no judge or defense lawyer present, they can ask questions
without regard to the usual rules of evidence, limited only by
their own sense of responsibility and decency.
</P>
<P>
   The danger of abuse is especially great in the case of an
independent counsel, who has no limits of budget or time. That is
why I decided to write about the question put to Blumenthal. In a
republic based on law, degradation of the legal process is
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here, I think, is third-rate prosecutors full of
hubris and obsessed by sex. I am sure they have pursued that
obsession with other grand-jury witnesses who have so far been too
scared or too embarrassed to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   Who will be brave enough to take on this abuse of power? Starr
is renting more office space, evidently ready to go on indefinitely
looking for some way to bring down President Clinton. Who will cry
hold, enough?

is demonstrating that women can do some things better, that they
have many biological and cognitive advantages over men _ and vice

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York

concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New

   Every day, Marcie Rothman, 51, takes three Body Wise Female
Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22 ingredients
marketed as the natural answer to menopause. And she's not alone.
Like many women her age, Rothman is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments. But how safe are they? And just how effective? Karen
Stabiner, a Los Angeles-based writer who is the author of ``To

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their

Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   Writer Dorion Sagan details the biological and cognitive
advantages women have over men in ``Gender Specifics: Why Women
Aren't Men,'' the lead feature from WOMEN'S HEALTH, an exclusive
special section from The New York Times which covers a range of
health issues and addresses every stage of a woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Following up last year's popular section, WOMEN'S HEALTH probes
even deeper into the medical innovations and trends that affect
women _ and the people close to them.
</P>
<P>
   Nine first-rate features _ with art _ from ``Women's Health''
are available from The New York Times Syndicate. Edited for length,
these decisive reports from top-caliber writers and medical experts
can provide a platform for your own health supplement.

   With the recent introduction of Viagra, the impotence pill made
by Pfizer, the world has changed. Suddenly there is a pill for men
who have trouble getting and maintaining erections. Almost as
suddenly, drug-company scientists, wondering whether Viagra or
something like it can enhance sex for women, are asking academic
scientists what is known about women's sexual responses. The answer
is not much, writes Gina Kolata, who reports on science and
medicine for The New York Times.

   The number of liposuction operations increased 215 percent to
149,042 from 47,212 between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest
statistics from the American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive
Surgeons in Arlington Heights, Ill. Plastic surgeons performed
32,607 breast augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did
122,285. As the numbers show, cosmetic surgery is soaring thanks to
baby boomers who are looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags
and wrinkles. But what are the hazards? Susan Gilbert, who writes
regularly about health for the Science Times section of The New
York Times, reports.

   It took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their

a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility. The odds can be long when it comes to infertility
treatment, reports free-lance journalist Anne Adams Lang. And the
odds of having insurance cover what is needed can be even trickier.

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted
medical writer Kathleen McAuliffe to seek prenatal testing. The
grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious baby.
But the results of her amniocentesis were ominous. The fetus was
male and appeared to be normal _ except for an alteration on one
chromosome. If even a fraction of a gene had been nicked or
scrambled, the consequences could be terrible. The child might be
born deformed or retarded and suffer from multiple disabilities. In
this poignant feature, McAuliffe leads readers into the murky world
of genetics and recounts her personal plan of action.

   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies, reports Leslie
Eaton, a financial reporter who covers Wall Street for The New York
Times. In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.

<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
more differences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences
that exist between men and women necessitate developing distinct
therapeutic treatments addressing the specifics of our physiology.
</P>
<P>
   For example, doctors like Dr. Susan G. Kornstein, at the Medical
College of Virginia's department of psychiatry, are advocating the
use of sex-specific assessment and treatment of psychiatric
disorders, like depression.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent paper published in the Journal of Clinical
Psychiatry, Kornstein points out that while depressed men seem to
respond best to drugs that affect two neurotransmitter systems,
those involving norepinephrine and serotonin, women respond better
to drugs that affect only the serotonin system.
</P>
<P>
   These differences in the therapeutic benefits of drugs not only
underscore the need for medicine to go beyond giving women tapered
doses of whatever is being prescribed for men (a latter-day
offshoot of the women-as-incomplete-men theory), but support the
idea that men's and women's brains do not function the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it is not only our brain functions that apparently
diverge, but just about every aspect of our physiology. The way we
metabolize alcohol and drugs, the way our circulatory system works
and how resistant we are to infection are all affected by our sex.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Hormones.
</P>
<P>
   In utero, girls and boys are chromosomally different; one might
wag that the determinant of maleness, the Y chromosome, named for
its shape, is ``missing'' something that the female determinant,
the X chromosome, has. But they look identical.
</P>
<P>
   The development of characteristic male and female sexual
genitalia at birth and of secondary sexual characteristics like
breasts during adolescence, result from influxes of hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   But the hormones we once thought were important only for
pregnancy, lactation and sexual drive have profound effects on just
about every organ in the body.
</P>
<P>
   For example, recent research demonstrates that while men begin
to suffer from coronary artery disease earlier in life than women
do, women are more likely to die of coronary complications once
they are afflicted. Men are also more prone throughout most of
their lives to high-blood pressure, but as women get older, this
advantage disappears.
</P>
<P>
   The delayed onset of cardiovascular disease in women may be
linked to the fact that the female hormone, estrogen, which is
produced mostly by the ovaries, protects the circulatory system
from disease.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in the quantities of estrogen, essential for
organization and maintenance of tissues and organs in both sexes,
plays an important role in brain development and appears to be the
reason that men's brains are bigger, but women's brains have more
neurons.
</P>
<P>
   Estrogen makes blood vessels more elastic, stimulates them to
expand and allow good blood flow, and prevents cholesterol
accumulation on the inside of blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   As women age, however, they lose the protective benefits of
estrogen because, in a rather dramatic fashion, their bodies stop
producing it.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some treatments that are used to prevent
cardiovascular disorders _ aspirin, for example _ are less
effective in women.
</P>
<P>
   Reporting in a recent issue of the International Journal of
Fertility and Women's Medicine, Dr. Marianne Legato, of the
Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, notes:
``Although aspirin use is associated with less frequent myocardial
infarction in both men and women, it does not decrease the risk of
stroke in hypertensive women, as it does in men.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of naturally produced compounds that
fluctuate more in women than in men: steroids, for example, which
are infamous on the street for their simultaneous role in
developing muscles and shortening tempers.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that steroids, a class of compounds that includes
sex hormones, may play an important role in the mood swings of
menstruators. These hormones directly affect brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   The neuroactive steroid allopregnanolone, made from
progesterone, dampens the sensitivity of brain cells; it works like
benzodiazepine drugs, most familiarly Valium. When the progesterone
level is high, a woman is calmer. When it is low, she may feel more
anxious and irritable. Moreover, women with PMS become insensitive
to the calming effects of Valium-like drugs.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing consensus that these steroids produced by the
sex organs are responsible for the greater incidence of mood
disorders and depression in women. And a growing body of research
is pointing to a role for other, similar steroids in memory, stress
and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with the increasing recognition that some powerful
mind-altering substances are internally produced by hormones, it is
no wonder that adolescence is often a time of emotional turbulence.
You cannot ``Just say no'' to your body's own genetically timed
release of mood-altering sex hormones at puberty.
</P>
<P>
   What society considers ``recreational'' drug use, which often
begins at adolescence, may sometimes be motivated by an effort to
self-medicate, changing or reversing the effects of sex hormones
and neuroactive steroids. The notorious mood swings of adolescents
may very likely reflect the body's adjustment to new concentrations
and combinations of these compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lester Grinspoon, an associate professor of psychiatry at
Harvard Medical School and an advocate of the medical use of
marijuana, points out that marijuana has long been known as a
palliative for the psychophysical pains of menstruation. Queen
Victoria, according to her doctor J.R. Reynolds, used it for that
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously (and although since disputed), one of the few medical
studies on marijuana suggests that its use lowers testosterone
levels in men.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this drug, among others, interacts with or works in a
similar way to the hormonal and neuroactive steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In any case women, who are twice as prone as men to depression,
and who have a higher body-fat-to-muscle ratio and more hormonally
distinct brains, cannot be expected to respond to drugs, legal or
illegal, in the same way men do.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, humans have learned that the two sexes, subtly
different, develop differently, respond differently to certain
drugs and see the world in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   As the French say, vive la difference.

<P>
   Western thought about sex _ from the story of Eve to Aristotle's
belief that girl babies arise from cooler sperm _ has been tainted
by the notion that the female is a kind of imperfect or unfinished
male.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science, however, has gone from treating women as though
they were simply smaller men to realizing that sex confers many
moredifferences than those that are related to reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the feminist premise that women can do anything
men can do, science is demonstrating that women can do some things
better, that they have many biological and cognitive advantages
over men. Then again, there are some things that women don't do as
well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the less visible, but theoretically very important
differences, is the larger size of the connector in women between
the two hemispheres of the brain. This means that women's
hemispheres are less specialized: a stroke that damages the left
side of the brain leaves men barely capable of speech, while the
same damage to a woman's brain is far less debilitating since she
can use both sides for language.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no hard evidence, the larger connector may
also account for a woman's tendency to exhibit greater intuition
(the separate brain halves are more integrated) and a man's
generally stronger right-handed throwing skills (controlled by a
left hemisphere without distractions).
</P>
<P>
   Mary Catherine Bateson, the cultural anthropologist and a former
president of Amherst College, has described women as ``peripheral
visionaries'' able to follow several trains of thought (or
children) simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Men, by contrast, seem more capable of focusing intensely on
single topics. Our strengths, then, come from our differences
rather than from our similarities.
</P>
<P>
   Science and medicine are finally realizing that the differences

<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

<P>
   Dr. Julia Heiman, a psychologist who directs the reproductive
and sexual medicine clinic at the University of Washington, wanted
to know whether women become sexually excited by talk of love and
romance, or are they turned on by explicit talk of sex itself?
</P>
<P>
   So Heiman asked college students to wear a tamponlike device
that detects blood flow to the vagina. While they wore it, the
young women listened to romantic tape recordings and to erotic
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Heiman got her answer: If blood flow to the vagina is an
accurate measure of sexual excitement, women, like men, are
sexually excited by erotic talk, not romance.
</P>
<P>
   That was in the early 1970s. Yet even now, when most fields of
medicine have been transformed, Heiman's studies are still state of
the art.
</P>
<P>
   With the recent introduction of Viagra, however, the impotence
pill made by Pfizer, the world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly there is a pill for men who have trouble getting and
maintaining erections. Almost as suddenly, drug-company scientists,
wondering whether Viagra or something like it can enhance sex for
women, are asking academic scientists what is known about women's
sexual responses.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not much.
</P>
<P>
   ``For most medical professionals, a woman's genitals are still
`down there,''' said Dr. John Gagnon, a sociology professor at the
State University of New York at Stony Brook. At their mention,
Gagnon added, ``Everyone averts their eyes in horror.''
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, he said, is finding out what gives women pleasure
and how to enhance their pleasure. Men worry that ``if she enjoys
it too much, will she do it with someone besides me?'' Gagnon
explained.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes the evidence that many women are unhappy with
their sex lives. Dr. Sandra R. Leiblum, a psychologist at the
Robert Wood Johnson Medical Center in New Brunswick, N.J., noted
that ``every survey invariably finds that many more women than men
complain of sexual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum cited a major survey in the United States that found a
third of women respondents _ but only a sixth of men _ saying they
are uninterested in sex. One-fifth of the women _ but only
one-tenth of the men _ said sex gave them no pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Leiblum said she thinks most sexual complaints in women are
psychological. Most women can have orgasms easily by masturbating,
she said, ``when they don't feel pressured to perform, and when
they don't feel concerns about how they look or how they are formed
or how they smell.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is also much easier and more socially acceptable to study
psychological problems than the physiology of sexual responses in
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a huge resistance'' to understanding women's sexual
responses, said Dr. James H. Geer, a professor of psychology at
Louisiana State University and an inventor of the tamponlike device
that Heiman, his graduate student then, used in her studies.
</P>
<P>
   Geer and his colleagues developed that device without financing,
he said, which is typically how studies of female sexuality are
done.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this reluctance, the simplest questions have no
answers. Half a century ago, when Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey surveyed the
sex lives of Americans, he proclaimed that men and women have
basically the same sexual responses, except that men are more
influenced by psychological factors.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. John Bancroft, the director of the Kinsey Institute at
Indiana University, said that scientists now know that ``Kinsey was
wrong about psychological differences.'' Yet, Bancroft added,
``Whether he was wrong about physiological similarities remains an
open question.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Viagra increases blood flow to the penis, enabling
men to have erections. By analogy, some doctors have suggested that
Viagra might also increase blood flow to the clitoris and enhance a
woman's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Gagnon noted, the idea that women suffer from
inadequate blood flow to the clitoris has no experimental evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were women with inadequate clitoral swelling, how
would we know that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers who want to directly measure sexual responses in
women are stymied by a lack of a good method, Heiman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics have said that her studies, involving blood flow to
the vagina, focused on the wrong organ. Why did she avoid the
clitoris? Because no one has figured out how to study the
physiological changes in the clitoris during sexual arousal, Heiman
said. It is not easy to fit the clitoris with a measuring device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The clitoris is so sensitive that simply touching it could
trigger a response,'' she explained.
</P>
<P>
   Women often complain of having difficulty lubricating, so some
researchers tried to measure the secretion of vaginal fluids while
women watched erotic movies or listened to erotic tapes. The
researchers used tampons, weighing them before and after the women
were stimulated.
</P>
<P>
   But the tampons turned out to be too crude to measure the amount
of vaginal secretions. So far, no one has found a reliable way to
measure vaginal fluids secreted during arousal, and no one knows
how much fluid is enough and how much is insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer, meanwhile, is hoping to bypass the morass of ignorance
regarding women's sexual physiology and simply ask, Does Viagra
improve women's sex lives?
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frances Quirk, who works for Pfizer at its research center
in Sandwich, England, said that the early studies of Viagra in men
concentrated solely on ways to measure the drug's physical effects
on erections. But the company soon redirected its efforts, Quirk
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big breakthroughs was in understanding that patient
assessments and perceptions can yield valuable information,'' she
said. ``This is probably even more important for women.''
</P>
<P>
   Borrowing from the same method, Dr. Quirk and her colleagues
developed a questionnaire that asks women how often they have sex,
how confident they are as a sexual partner and how well and how
quickly they respond to sexual stimulation. They tested their
survey with 1,160 women living in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Quirk said, appear to show a relationship between
women's symptoms of sexual dysfunction and worries about the future
of their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   For example, 34 percent of women who said they had difficulty
becoming aroused said they worry about the future of their sex
lives, whereas just 5 percent of those who had no such difficulty
with arousal had this worry. And 13 percent of those who had
difficulty lubricating _ as compared with 8 percent who had no such
problem _ were anxious about their sex lives.
</P>
<P>
   Now, sex researchers say, the moment of truth is looming.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to justify Viagra in men because the drug, as Pfizer
keeps emphasizing, does not increase desire. All it does is help a
man who already has the desire for sex to achieve an erection.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary complaint among women is the lack of desire. For
society to sanction research on sexual dysfunction in women, Heiman
said, ``People would have to view women's sexual desire as an
important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, drug companies are not the federal
government. They can go ahead with sex research if there is a
problem that needs to be treated and a market for a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``One could say that having a lack of information on women's
sexuality is just fine with the general culture,'' Heiman said,
``but it may not be so fine with the drug industry.''

<P>
   Sitting naked on tissue paper, mouth dry, heart flip-flopping,
clawing at the plastic hide of the examining table, I do not feel
as if I'm in a power position.
</P>
<P>
   It's been more than 30 minutes and the paper is adhering,
shifting with me.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination is metastasizing; the syringes, catheters and
scalpels in the cabinet all have my name on them.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a fully-dressed human being marches into the room
weary, impatient and, while reading from a folder that really does
have my name written on it, demands, ``What seems to be the
trouble?''
</P>
<P>
   If this were a true story, I would mumble, ``I'm really sorry to
bother you, doctor, but. ...'' But since this is a fantasy, I smile
confidently as I gesture at a person sitting quietly in a corner
and say: ``This is my Patients Union representative, doctor. You
don't mind if we videotape the session?''
</P>
<P>
   In 20 years of serious travel in what I call Malady, the country
of illness, as a cancer patient and as a caregiver, I have come to
be certain only of this: You must never cross the border into that
country by yourself.
</P>
<P>
   At best, your traveling companion should be a healthy spouse or
a partner with advanced degrees in accounting, diplomacy, law,
medicine and comedy. That is a fantasy even I don't entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Too often we make the journey alone, sick and scared, vulnerable
to bullying billing clerks, snide receptionists, overworked
technicians and nurses and doctors who can rarely take the time to
listen to a history that can ensure a future.
</P>
<P>
   So. Let me introduce the Patients Union.
</P>
<P>
   At its most personal level, your Patients Union local would
supply a sidekick, a seasoned traveler in Malady, to be a second
pair of eyes and ears at a doctor's appointment and at a meeting
with your health insurance company or with the hospital's financial
department.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the national organization would be giving ulcers to
government agencies, HMOs and drug companies that aren't acting in
your best interest.
</P>
<P>
   When I say all this, and until now it has mostly been said at
parties after the medicinal red wine, the doctors smile tightly or
roll their eyes or, if they understand that I am not kidding, shift
uncomfortably as if they are sitting on tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard for them to understand that the Patients Union does
not necessarily consider doctors to be the central target of
protest and change _ they have always cherished their centrality to
medicine _ but rather another element, caught as we are in a
Titanic medical-corporate complex.
</P>
<P>
   We need to seize control of the bridge and-or the lifeboats by
banding together as boldly as the doctors, nurses, hospitals and
accountants have.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element that even the ultimate
GE-Disney-Microsoft HMO can never completely control or contain.
</P>
<P>
   We are the one element they can never do without _ their raw
material, product, customer base, constituency. Without sick
people, they are dead.
</P>
<P>
   But sick people and their caregivers have traditionally been
balkanized not only by age, race, gender, class and money but, most
critically, by disease.
</P>
<P>
   Almost every major malady has its own laboratory and lobbyist,
national society, celebrity chairman, board of famous doctors and,
too often, financing from a drug company profiting from the
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Each malady competes with other maladies for government money,
publicity and TV movies of the week.
</P>
<P>
   While the gallantry and media savvy of the AIDS bandwagon played
on, the breast-cancer forces learned and prospered. Now the
prostate boys are moving up. Look for mental illness, particularly
depression, adult schizophrenia and bipolar disorders to be coming
on strong.
</P>
<P>
   Does this make sense? Can you imagine if those diseases joined
forces, if they included the sufferers of lupus, multiple
sclerosis, Crohn's disease, diabetes, sickle-cell anemia; if they
embraced the marathon caregivers of people with Canavan's disease
and Alzheimer's; if they found room for the quads, the hep Cs, the
almost invisible heroes of Charcot-Marie-Tooth, a chronic,
incurable neuromuscular disease?
</P>
<P>
   For three weeks this spring, while appearing on call-in radio
shows and at bookstores from Miami to Seattle, I spoke with
hundreds of fellow patients and was amazed anew at how bound we are
by common concerns, regardless of sex or disease.
</P>
<P>
   We are frightened and outraged by the tyranny of current
health-insurance practices. Even when we are lucky enough to have
decent coverage, we often feel trapped in the job that offers it.
</P>
<P>
   We are frustrated by the decreasing amount of ``face time'' with
doctors, who themselves admit that the relationship between doctor
and patient is critical to getting and staying well.
</P>
<P>
   And we are bedeviled by the message of the healer-dealers that
somehow we are at fault for being sick; that it is a shame and a
punishment, and that we should be grateful for any casual mercies
the system dispenses.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had thought of the Patients Union in Miami instead of
in Seattle, so that I could have crossed the country with a sheaf
of membership applications.
</P>
<P>
   Joining is easy, I would have said. All you need is an old
medical bill and a willingness to protest against, even picket, a
doctor who doesn't share information and options; an HMO making
cost-efficient, rather than life-saving decisions; a drug company
inflating prices; and a government official selling us out.
</P>
<P>
   In my organizing speech I would say: Our imperfect union of
imperfect people will include the measured brand-testing of the
Consumers Union and the muscular intimidation of the teamsters'
union under Jimmy Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   While our C.U. side will distribute those best doctor-best
hospital lists that the glossy magazines love so much, our lists
will include mortality, hygiene, affability and cost charts.
</P>
<P>
   Our teamsters' side will throw the occasional chanting picket
line around an HMO that cuts services and raises prices.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly, there will be union wildcats, officially disavowed,
of course, who will leave bad administrators, doctors and
politicians outside TV studios dressed only in their ``malpractice
suits'' _ naked except for a wrap of tissue paper.
</P>
<P>
   At Patients Union meetings, we will keep reminding one another
that as customers we have a right to demand service, to get
information and to be part of the decision-making process, which
ultimately includes who gets all the new drugs and procedures for
which we are paying through taxes and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   Each meeting will include an injection of tumor humor, that
nasty, silly, self-affirming chemotherapy for the spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Patients and caregivers need permission to mock health-care
providers behind their backs (doc spelled backward is cod, after
all, not god) or to make the offensive, scatalogical-location jokes
that somehow ease the most painful of journeys.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone will get Patients Union T-shirts and bumper stickers
saying: P.U. because the system stinks!
</P>
<P>
   And no meeting can end without the fight speech: ``Nobody wants
to be a professional patient, to be identified by what has gone
wrong. But merely waiting for magic bullets or another gang take
over is just another way of giving up.''

<P>
   As a securities analyst for the brokerage firm Salomon Smith
Barney, and one of the first people on Wall Street to specialize in
companies focusing on women, Melissa Wilmoth can rattle off
demographic facts and figures that show women are becoming a vast
and powerful market for medical products.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth speaks excitedly about technological breakthroughs and
new devices that will improve the treatment of breast and cervical
cancers, osteoporosis, incontinence and infertility. And she can
reel off a long list of small companies that are developing these
new products.
</P>
<P>
   So of the two dozen companies in Wilmoth's area of expertise,
how many does she recommend as investments? Two, both of which have
business links to her firm.
</P>
<P>
   This situation exemplifies Wall Street's attitude toward
investing in women's health care: a lot of hope, a little hype and
a huge amount of caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to recommend stocks that aren't good
investments,'' Wilmoth said.
</P>
<P>
   The financial track record of many women's health companies is
not good, but neither is the financial performance of most small
medical firms.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, biotechnology companies, including some
concentrating on women, were the hottest stocks on Wall Street. But
few lived up to investors' expectations, and their high-flying
stocks plunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have been wiped out,'' said Morton A. Cohen,
who operates Clarion Partners, an investment management firm in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Because they were burned, many long-term investors shunned
biotechnology, Cohen said. He has persevered, he added, because
``it's the industry of the 21st century, with a lot of unexploited
areas, such as women's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors have been burned twice. In 1995 and 1996, about
10 companies sold stock to the public for the first time. These
were not biotechnology firms; rather, they were working on devices
for diagnosing and treating ailments that afflict women.
</P>
<P>
   But after a sizzling debut, most of the stocks sank.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Wilmoth said, was that these companies' products
``were early stage, and it may have been a little premature for
them to go public.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ran into trouble persuading the Food and Drug
Administration to approve their products, insurance companies to
cover their costs or doctors to use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   An extreme case was Imagyn Medical, which went public in May
1996 for $15 a share. Though the stock immediately rose, going as
high as $18, the company quickly ran into difficulties as customers
cut their orders of its microlaparoscopes, which are used in
gynecological examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Imagyn merged with Urohealth Systems, a troubled
company that produces urological medical products. An investor who
bought Imagyn's stock at $15 now owns shares worth about $1.50
each.
</P>
<P>
   The shares have fallen mostly because the company's earnings
were not as strong as analysts had expected, said David Pyrce,
Imagyn's vice president for investor relations, adding, ``It's sort
of the kiss of death to disappoint Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright hopes but poor performance help explain Wall Street's
ambivalence toward women's health-care companies. Only a handful of
analysts follow the sector, up from zero just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Conferences on the subject are springing up, always a sure sign
of Wall Street's interest. On the other hand, there is no mutual
fund devoted to women's health companies despite the proliferation
of specialized funds.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia F. Widner can explain why. Widner is a co-manager of
the Warburg Pincus Health Science Fund, the top fund in the health
sector over the last year. She tracks almost 40 small, innovative
companies, many specializing in women's health and urological and
reproductive medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm intrigued,'' she said, but as of late May, she added, ``I
don't own any of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because they do not meet all of the fund's criteria for
companies, including having more than one product to sell and an
experienced management that can operate a new business, deal with
the FDA, reassure Wall Street and persuade insurance companies to
reimburse doctors who use their new products.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not enough to invest in good science,'' Widner said,
echoing colleagues. ``It's a good business we're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Even professional investors most likely to take big risks _ the
early investors known as venture capitalists _ have been slow to
commit to women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most venture capitalists are guys,'' explained Cynthia
Robbins-Roth, the editor of Bioventure Publishing in San Mateo,
Calif., which tracks developments in that field.
</P>
<P>
   But more venture capitalists will become interested,
Robbins-Roth said, as the big pharmaceutical companies become
corporate partners with the little companies or simply buy them.
</P>
<P>
   That is starting to happen. Biopsys, which makes equipment for
breast biopsies and went public in 1996, was bought last year by
Johnson &AMP; Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Investors who purchased at the initial offering would have
almost doubled their money in a year, Wilmoth noted.
</P>
<P>
   Other big corporations, like Eli Lilly and American Home
Products, are also making sizable efforts in women's health care.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for mergers, acquisitions and stock underwritings
_ all lucrative businesses for Wall Street _ helps explain
analysts' growing interest in women's health companies.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, too, are trying to improve reputations tarnished by
lawsuits contending that they discriminated against female
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney, for example, settled such a suit earlier
this year; individual claims are now being heard by arbitrators.
</P>
<P>
   An emphasis on women's health also gives firms a chance to lure
women, who have previously been ignored by Wall Street and
represent a huge untapped market, into becoming investors. But
there may be sound financial reasons behind the advice that women
should invest in companies catering to their medical needs.
</P>
<P>
   If the demographers and financial gurus are right, women will be
spending large sums on health care in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't you benefit from the trend you are paying
into?'' asked Widner, the mutual-fund manager.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, that may mean investing mainly in major
pharmaceutical companies such as Eli Lilly, Merck, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and American Home Products, which is merging with Monsanto.
</P>
<P>
   Among the specialty companies, Wilmoth recommends Trex Medical,
which makes a new, high-tech mammography machine, and ESC Medical
Systems, which produces lasers for dermatology and depilatory uses.
Both have sold stock through Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Wilmoth predicted that many more companies will be profitable
enough to make them attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sector is driven by demographics,'' she said. ``The
demographics equal dollars, and the dollars equal profits.''

<P>
   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptoms and phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

   Are men worth it?
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, is the maxim true about marriage being good for
a man's health but hazardous for a woman's _ or is it a sly old
spinster's tale?
</P>
<P>
   Do we live better with men or without them, and which life will
be longer, and which will simply seem longer?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, like marriage itself, is a glorious mess.
Nevertheless, it can be roughly summed up as follows: Marriage is
pretty good for the goose much of the time, but golden for the
gander practically all of the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marriage has a beneficial effect for both men and women, but
the effect is much stronger for men,'' said Jeffery Sobal, an
associate professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell University.
``Men may resist, they may kick and scream about getting married,
but then it does them a world of good.''
</P>
<P>
   A little background first. Researchers first noticed the
benefits of marriage to men's health and longevity in the mid-19th
century.
</P>
<P>
   For women, the epidemiological picture was less clear, but
everybody assumed that they, too, must thrive in matrimony: After
all, weren't women the ones who wanted it so badly?
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, however, Jesse Bernard wrote a highly influential book
called ``The Future of Marriage'' in which she argued that wedding
bells sounded the death knell to a woman's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard presented data indicating that while married men scored
higher than single men on measures of mental health like
depression, severe neurotic symptoms and phobic tendencies, the
opposite applied for women.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers of the era came to similar conclusions, and to
this day the belief persists that the ranking of personal
satisfaction runs from married men at the blissful peak, followed
by single women, married women and, lastly, by single men.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the conventional portrait of marriage as chicken soup for
the man, battery acid for the woman is misleading.
</P>
<P>
   According to Linda J. Waite, a sociologist at the University of
Chicago, the early studies were too limited in how they defined
mental health.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you broaden the psychological outcomes that you look at,
you see that marriage is good for both sexes,'' Waite said. ``It
helps men on this dimension, women on that dimension, but there's
no difference in the sum total of benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, marriage protects women against problem
drinking better than it does men, and it helps shield men against
depression more effectively than it does women.
</P>
<P>
   In Waite's view, a strong marriage is a nondenominational wonder
drug. She cites evidence from a recent cross-cultural survey, which
found that married people in 17 countries reported feeling
significantly happier than their unmarried peers.
</P>
<P>
   In another study, researchers analyzed 11 measures of
psychological well-being in a group of people at the beginning and
end of five years. During that time, some subjects got married,
others were widowed or divorced and still others stayed married. On
nearly all 11 variables, the still-marrieds outperformed everybody
_ except the recently married.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something about being married that makes people work
better,'' Waite said. ``We're group-living animals, and we're
hard-wired to bond.''
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to say you feel chipper and self-confident. But
does the body listen? There, the data for women are murkier.
</P>
<P>
   In a report that will be published in the fall in the Journal of
Health and Social Behavior, Dr. Ingrid Waldron of the University of
Pennsylvania and her colleagues looked at a group of 3,000 young
women over 10 years. They explored the effect of marriage and
employment status on 16 measures of general physical health _
including proneness to chronic fatigue or dizziness, the distance
one can walk and the weight one can lift.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded that marriage improved the physical health of
women who were not employed outside the home. But for working
women, being married or single made no physical difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect that it's a matter of social support,'' said
Waldron, a biologist. ``You can get that support from your husband,
or you can get it from being around other adults at work, but
having it is what seems to be the key.''
</P>
<P>
   For men, on the other hand, nuptials offer health benefits
independent of employment status.
</P>
<P>
   Most studies show that matrimony adds more years to a man's life
than it does to a woman's, said Joan S. Tucker, a psychologist at
Brandeis University.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage can even make frail men strong. Researchers from the
Rand Center for the Study of Aging in Santa Monica, Calif.,
recently determined that men in comparatively poor condition were
more likely than men in robust shape to get married, and at an
earlier age.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite their initial health handicap, the married men ended
up with a three- to four-year advantage in life span over their
single brethren.
</P>
<P>
   Matrimony helps men even as it thickens their waistlines. Sobal
and his colleagues at Cornell have calculated that men gain more
weight as a result of being married than women do. Yet they still
outlast the confirmed bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   Among the elderly, losing a spouse hits men harder than it does
women. Dr. Maradee A. Davis, an epidemiologist at the University of
California, San Francisco, and her co-workers recently reported
that men 70 or older experienced a 20 percent rise in their risk of
death in the year after the loss of a wife, but that older women
who lost a husband experienced a slight decrease in their risk of
dying within the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaping to the conclusion that wives do far too much for
their mates, though, it bears recalling that women outlive men by
about eight years, regardless of who is happily coupled and who
miserably alone.
</P>
<P>
   Men may need marriage; men very likely invented it in the first
place. But women can only offer them so much protection against an
untimely departure.

<P>
   IT took Carla and Bruce P. three and a half gut-wrenching years
of invasive medical treatments and more than $40,000 of their
savings before Carla got pregnant in April. That makes them part of
a small but growing population that beat what the New York State
Task Force on Life and the Law recognizes as the ``disease'' of
infertility.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky? Indisputably.
</P>
<P>
   First because Carla, a legal assistant, and Bruce, a real-estate
broker, succeeded when the biological odds are stacked against a
41-year-old woman conceiving even with high-tech intervention.
Second because Carla's new insurance carrier, U.S. Healthcare, paid
for the successful round of blood tests, sonograms, laboratory
work, egg harvesting, in-vitro fertilization and implanting the
resulting embryos. All this was performed by one of New York City's
top reproductive medical teams, which was led by Dr. Cecilia
Schmidt-Sarosi and her husband, Dr. Peter Sarosi, reproductive
endocrinologists.
</P>
<P>
   That insurance policy saved Carla and Bruce, who do not want
their last name published, roughly $10,000 that they would have
paid themselves if they had approached the managed-care company
just one month later.
</P>
<P>
   On April 1, U.S. Healthcare, now merged with Aetna, canceled its
coverage of in-vitro fertilization and other high-tech fertility
treatments, making it available to employers only through a rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we were one of the few programs covering IVF, women
flocked to us who could not find coverage elsewhere,'' said Jill
Griffiths, a spokeswoman for Aetna Healthcare. The policy, she
said, was simply too expensive to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We contacted them in March and when I read that the company
had stopped the policy, my heart just dropped,'' Bruce said. ``But
we lucked out. We got coverage on a shoestring, and we just got in
under the wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance carriers are mostly like poltergeists haunting the
field of reproductive medicine. They materialize with ephemeral
policies that are changed or are withdrawn in a flash.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently, for example, Group Health Insurance, one of the
largest carriers in New York, announced that it is withdrawing its
coverage for all assisted reproductive technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless they operate in states with mandates to cover
infertility treatments, such as Massachusetts, Illinois and
Maryland, managed-care and indemnity insurers have ignored
fertility coverage and gotten away with it,'' said Dr. Norbert
Gleicher, who founded the Center for Human Reproduction, a
Chicago-based chain of fertility treatment centers. ``That's
imminently about to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gleicher, who recently contracted with Oxford Health Plans
to do a joint venture with Columbia University, gave three reasons
for the new interest in fertility coverage:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VIAGRA. &LR;  The White House decision to require Medicaid coverage
of the drug that treats male sexual dysfunction, and mounting
pressure on private insurance companies to do the same, has opened
the floodgates to sexual-discrimination suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once insurance companies conclude they have to cover Viagra,
how can they not cover female infertility drugs?'' Gleicher asked.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LEGAL PRECEDENT. &LR;  A police officer sued the city of Chicago for
violating the Americans With Disabilities Act, saying infertility
is a disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``A disability is an impairment of a body system that inhibits a
major life activity,'' said Patricia Collins, the lawyer who won
the class-action suit this year. ``The only question is whether
procreation is a major life activity. My position is, if work is a
major life activity, I would hope procreation is as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Susan B. Conlon agreed and the city settled, saying it
would follow Illinois's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ECONOMICS. &LR;  ``Smart insurance companies are recognizing that it
may be in their interest to cover, even to a limited extent,
infertility because it brings an underground economy in fertility
services above ground,'' Gleicher said.
</P>
<P>
   He explained that doctors often perform infertility treatments,
like tubal surgeries, and list them as a different, often more
costly procedure so that patients can secure coverage.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published in September, William M. Mercer, a
firm of human-resource consultants, concludes that the hidden costs
of infertility treatments range from 27 cents to 50 cents a month
for each member of the insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on co-pay arrangements and how well the plans are
managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

managed, it would cost in the neighborhood of 40 cents to 50 cents
to provide coverage,'' said Lisa Astor, a consultant at Mercer.
```Our thoughts are that employers are already paying for
infertility whether they know it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also a wave of consumer anger over the right to
reproduce that threatens to engulf lawmakers in several states,
including New York.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman David S. Sidikman has introduced a bill that would
require insurers to cover the diagnosis and treatment of
infertility. State Senator Seymour Lachman recently introduced a
similar bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who make $250,000 a year are the ones swinging the
out-of-pocket costs for assisted reproduction,'' said Pamela
Madsen, the executive director of the New York chapter of Resolve,
a support and advocacy group for infertile individuals. ``Maybe
they have to give up the vacation. The more middle class are giving
up their homes, and the working poor are out of it altogether.''
</P>
<P>
   Madsen and her husband gave birth to two children using IVF and,
she said: ``I have four embryos at Mount Sinai waiting for me in
the freezer that I can't access. I'm tapped out, mortgaged out,
credit-carded out. And we were lucky. We got our babies. We still
live in a one-bedroom apartment. We had a nest egg when we got
married; we had health insurance, and the system wasn't there for
us. We are the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   Even without legislation forcing coverage, assisted-reproduction
technology specialists are gearing up for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more and more patients going to centers, which
increases the volume and lowers the price,'' said Dr. Mark Sauer,
the director of Columbia University's division of reproductive
endocrinology. ``Corporate groups, for-profit groups and HMOs are
learning to split the heavy overhead of a university program like
research, and streamline certain operations.''
</P>
<P>
   Managed care, Dr. Sauer said, could act as a great leveler,
making fertility treatments ``possible for people without the kind
of resources to go to a fee-for-service boutique practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. James Grifo, the head of New York University Medical
Center's division of reproductive endocrinology, said his group is
negotiating, albeit reluctantly, with a managed-care company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would prefer to control our own fate,'' he said. The
problem is that large institutions like universities have less seed
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more onerous for them to start and support these kinds of
programs,'' Grifo said.
</P>
<P>
   Economic pressure has whittled the number of large academic
medical institutions where new reproductive technologies are
incubated. The many that remain need high volume, said Dr. Zev
Rosenwaks, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology and the
director of the New York Center for Reproductive Medicine and
Infertility at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 100 staffers,'' Rosenwaks said. ``You cannot run
a program that's a good program, that has full research and all
aspects of lab work without having a critical mass of patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cornell program has grown to 750 patients a year from
approximately 250 patients in 1988 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're constantly re-evaluating the costs,'' Rosenwaks added,
while trying to accommodate a changing economic environment. That
requires market savvy, which means, he said, being
patient-friendly, including securing insurance coverage for IVF.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Schmidt-Sarosi, noting that small can be
profitable, said that a successful fertility clinic doesn't need
the ``heavy machinery of an academic setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do I need an academic telling me how to run my clinic?''
said Schmidt-Sarosi, who recently left the clinical practice at New
York University to open her own practice. ``Our prices are
competitive and lower. I don't have the overhead of hospitals.
Those of us who practice look at what is the out-of-pocket cost. We
streamline, so that if a patient is going to use drugs, we do IVF
faster. It's more efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   As for managed care, she said it will probably bring down IVF
costs to $5,000 per ovulation cycle from $10,000. That could lead
her to consider joining a network of small, high-quality clinics to
negotiate with good insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Other practitioners have devised a kind of money-back guarantee
approach to lowering costs.
</P>
<P>
   At the Shady Grove Fertility Center in Rockville, Md., for
example, patients pay $18,000 up front for three full IVF cycles.
Embryos are frozen and transferred without additional charges. If a
patient doesn't take home a baby, the money, minus a deductible of
$1,250 per cycle, is returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then you still have money for adoption,'' said Dr. Michael
Levy, a founder.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Aronson, the executive director of Resolve, warns that
such programs could be an incentive for doctors to implant more
embryos than is medically sound, to maximize the chances of
pregnancy on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Aronson is also concerned about the possibility of unscrupulous
clinic administrators practicing a bait-and-switch in which they
lure patients with the promise of a money-back guarantee only to
tell them that they don't qualify for that particular program.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his practice, Dr. Levy said that every program could
potentially exploit the consumer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fee-for-service, it's unnecessary procedures; in
capitated policies with a monetary limit, it's not doing necessary
procedures, and in shared risk, it's by treating patients
differently than you would treat others,'' he said. ``When we
looked at our data on shared risk, we analyzed whether we
transferred more embryos, and we put back exactly the same number
in fee-for-service.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I'd be very happy if there was no need for shared
risk. In France, where it's covered, they do five times the amount
of IVF as we do. There's a lot of politics hidden in this issue.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;  Anne Adams
<P>
   It has never been easier to have cosmetic surgery and other
beauty-enhancing procedures than now.
</P>
<P>
   More cosmetic surgeons are setting up shop as baby boomers are
looking longer in the mirror and seeing sags and wrinkles. New
lasers and other technologies keep coming out with the promise of
better results.
</P>
<P>
   And money is no longer an obstacle. Finance companies offering
to lend you the money in as little as 24 hours are advertising on
television, radio and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As one advertisement on the Web proposes, ``Why wait?''
</P>
<P>
   Industry figures indicate that fewer people are waiting and that
most of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   The number of liposuction operations, the most popular form of
cosmetic surgery, increased 215 percent to 149,042 from 47,212
between 1992 and 1997, according to the latest statistics from the
American Academy of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons in
Arlington Heights, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   More breast enlargements, eyelid lifts and face lifts are also
being done. Indeed, plastic surgeons performed 32,607 breast
augmentations in 1992; five years later, they did 122,285.
</P>
<P>
   The higher numbers reflect the fact that cosmetic surgery is
more acceptable and that people feel more pressured to look good
and age well.
</P>
<P>
   But many doctors say that the risk of complications is also
rising as record numbers of doctors and patients enter an
essentially unregulated field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a whole influx of folks into cosmetic surgery with a
whole variety of backgrounds, some with just a weekend course,''
said Dr. Dennis Lynch, the president of the American Academy of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons. ``Some of these physicians may
not even have a background in surgery.''
</P>
<P>
   And they don't have to be certified by the state or any medical
board to do this surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said that doctors are attracted to cosmetic surgery
because it is more lucrative than many other areas of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something that insurance reimburses, so there's
cash up front, without restrictions from managed care,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no national or statewide statistics on complications
and deaths from esthetic procedures. But since last fall, Lynch has
heard of 13 patients around the United States who have died from
liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, he knew of just four or five such deaths
in the three years before last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently the deaths involved surgeons misjudging what
patients can handle,'' he said, by taking out too much fat during
liposuction and doing a face lift simultaneously or operating on
patients with health problems that make the surgery high risk.
``There may be other deaths. This information tends to be concealed
in legal actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Established cosmetic surgeons say that more patients are asking
them to fix complications from procedures performed by other
doctors: impaired vision and even blindness from damage incurred
during eyelid lifts; eyelids that don't close completely because
too much skin was removed from the lower lid to eliminate bags;
internal injuries from liposuction; permanent skin discoloration
from laser treatment of wrinkles. Many doctors say the need for
repair work is partly linked to the lack of licensing and
regulation in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike, say, heart surgery, which can be performed only by
board-certified cardiologists under state laws, cosmetic surgery
can be performed by any licensed doctor. Any dentist can bleach or
bond teeth. And since esthetic procedures are usually performed in
doctors' offices, those doctors do not need to be affiliated with
hospitals, which places them outside professional peer reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the risks, doctors say, is that new technology and
techniques are appearing with record speed and heralded with more
aggressive publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything happens so much faster now, and evaluation of new
procedures and instruments is difficult,'' said Dr. Gerald H.
Pitman, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan and the author of a textbook
on liposuction.
</P>
<P>
   Because these procedures are often rushed to the market without
clinical trials, problems usually come to light after the work is
done.
 &UR; THE SAFE BETS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A patient's best hedge against complications and poor results is
to choose an experienced, well-qualified doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't do that by looking on the Web,'' Pitman said,
referring to the hundreds of doctors who publicize their practices
on Internet home pages. He suggested that people begin by obtaining
the names of doctors from friends who are satisfied with their
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get a name, ask physicians you know to check up on the
person,'' he said. ``Or ask your own doctors for names of plastic
surgeons.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors tend to specialize in, say, liposuction or face lifts,
so people should look for someone whose expertise lies in the
procedure being considered, Dr. Lynch noted.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor should be board-certified in plastic surgery or
another specialty that involves esthetic procedures, he added. The
field of expertise should be accepted by the American Board of
Medical Specialties, the organization that sets standards for
specialized medical training and practice. These specialties
include plastic surgery, which comprises cosmetic surgery like
liposuction and face lifts; reconstructive surgery to repair damage
from accidents or diseases; ophthalmology for eyelid lifts; ear,
nose and throat surgery for face lifts and rhinoplasty; and
dermatology for collagen injections and similar wrinkle treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetic surgery board is not a member of the American Board
of Medical Specialties, which makes a board-certified cosmetic
surgeon akin to an unaccredited university, said Dr. Steven Miller,
the American board's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Dolsky, a past president of the American Academy of
Cosmetic Surgery, takes issue with that view, saying that
board-certified cosmetic surgeons are well trained in cosmetic
procedures. Many are also board-certified in member specialties,
like plastic surgery or dermatology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When evaluating doctors, it is important to ask whether they
have privileges at a hospital, Lynch said, adding, ``That means
that they have to meet standards set by the hospital, even if they
do most of their surgery in their own offices.''
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the doctor's operating suite should be accredited
and evaluated by an organization like the American Association for
the Accreditation of Ambulatory Facilities or the Joint Commission
on the Accreditation of Health Care Organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Accreditation means that an outpatient clinic meets certain
standards, like being equipped to handle an emergency if surgery
goes wrong. But accreditation of all out-patient operating rooms is
mandatory in just nine states, including New Jersey, California,
Maryland and Pennsylvania. (It is pending in New York.)
</P>
<P>
   When meeting with a doctor, potential patients should ask what
they can expect _ not only how the work can improve their looks,
but the chances that they will need a second procedure to achieve
acceptable results. Even topflight surgeons' handiwork can be
imperfect, Lynch said. As much as 10 percent to 15 percent of nose
jobs, he added, need to be repeated to correct breathing problems
or to finesse one's appearance. ``Patients need to know that
cosmetic surgery is not a magic bullet,'' he said.

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious
baby. At 16 weeks, it had a gracefully arched spine and a classic
Roman profile.
</P>
<P>
   As my doctor maneuvered the syringe in my womb to get a sample
of amniotic fluid, the baby suddenly grasped in the direction of
the intruding object. ``That's a reflex response they sometimes
have to the fluid being disturbed,'' the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   The report from our genetic counselor was ominous. The fetus was
male, he haltingly began his call. It appeared to be normal _
except for an alteration on one chromosome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for?'' I screamed, prompting my husband to pick up the
other line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The baby is probably healthy,'' the counselor reassured us.
``In fact, if either of you have the same chromosome alteration the
fetus will be at no increased risk whatsoever. You'd be living
proof that the abnormality had no harmful effect.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the alteration in detail: a large segment of
chromosome 2 had done a 180-degree flip upside down known as an
inversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither of us has this defect?'' my husband asked.
</P>
<P>
   The baby still might be fine, the counselor said _ assuming no
gene had been lost in the reshuffling. But if even a fraction of a
gene had been nicked or scrambled, the consequences could be
terrible. He might be born deformed or retarded and suffer from
multiple disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of that happening, our counselor estimated, was
probably in the 5 percent to 10 percent range. A baby in the
overall population, the counselor reminded us, has a 2 percent to 3
percent risk of being born with a serious congenital anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, we agreed, was genetic testing for my husband and
me. If either of us had the defect, our worries would be over.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the news wasn't good; the inversion was the baby's.
</P>
<P>
   I accepted the news in my measured reporter mode, then hung up
the phone and howled. What were we to do with this information?
</P>
<P>
   Based on my knowledge and our pretest counseling, I viewed
amniocentesis as a test for Down's syndrome and other gross
chromosomal defects whose effects are debilitating or devastating
to a majority of those affected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, I saw the standard battery of tests performed
during prenatal screening as highly predictive and the information
of unquestionable utility.
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't know was that amniocentesis has become adept at
detecting tiny imperfections whose implications vary wildly. The
inversion detected in our fetus is one of many such smaller
defects, collectively known as chromosome structural abnormalities.
Accounting for one in every six hereditary aberrations detected by
amniocentesis in women over 35, they include microscopic deletions,
duplications and rearrangements that are highly idiosyncratic.
</P>
<P>
   In a face-to-face, hourlong meeting, our genetic counselor gave
us facts, such as they were. But he could shed little light on our
predicament. Various registries, which keep track of chromosome
abnormalities and their clinical implications, had been consulted,
but he was not aware of any other case like ours.
</P>
<P>
   We stared, mystified, at our son's stained chromosomes splayed
in black-and-white bands. Just how had our counselor come up with a
5 percent to 10 percent risk?
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this estimate was based on a single study of fewer
than 50 cases of similar inversions detected in fetuses electively
aborted or carried to term.
</P>
<P>
   With such a small sample size, the reliability of the odds we
had been given was dubious. But that didn't diminish the study's
power to shock. A table of abnormal outcomes listed a menagerie of
horrors: children with mushroom heads, clouded eyes and other
cruelties too awful to contemplate.
</P>
<P>
   My husband remained undaunted. The ultrasound at 16 weeks, he
pointed out, had been normal. If anything was wrong, it was
probably something minor that could be corrected. What's more, if I
continued the pregnancy, our genetic counselor had recommended a
final ultrasound scan at 20 weeks _ just before the legal cutoff
point for a late-stage abortion in Florida. Surely, he argued,
serious malformations would be detected then.
</P>
<P>
   I was not so reassured. Schooled in the intricacies of
developmental biology, I knew that an imperceptible error _ a
faulty hemoglobin molecule, a single missing enzyme in the brain or
liver _ could spell doom as surely as a grave deformity.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, the reality sunk in: We would have to make our
decision.
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I debated proceeding with the pregnancy. The
risk, in his view, was scary but not sufficient to warrant an
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, vacillated: One moment I was convinced the
risk to the fetus was negligible; the next moment I was conjuring
images of the monstrous ways a child could be wrenched from the
human template.
</P>
<P>
   During all this I got a call from a friend who has worn many
hats in his life, from internist and molecular biologist to medical
director of a company marketing genetic tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congratulations, I hear you're pregnant,'' he said, as if his
wife had not told him that the baby had a genetic abnormality. But
he was taking his cues from me and remained matter-of-fact,
answering technical questions and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   As our conversation ended, I finally asked, ``If you and your
wife were in my position what would you do?''
</P>
<P>
   The pause was so long I thought he hadn't heard me. Then in a
calm, clear voice he announced, ``I'd advise her in no uncertain
terms to terminate the pregnancy.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' he said, ``but you asked.''
</P>
<P>
   I tried to console myself that my choice would be clearer in
time. But each day I grew more muddled. I couldn't eat or sleep; I
dropped six pounds in almost as many days.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my husband finally said: ``I just want you to know that
I love you, and that your opinion counts most to me. It's your
body. Whatever you decide to do I'll respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Later I told him my decision: I wanted an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was veering in that direction myself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   My ob-gyn nobly agreed to do the abortion. But we made a pact:
The report of the fetal autopsy would be sent to a genetic registry
so that other couples might benefit from the findings. However, I
did not want to know the results.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel about my choice now? There is sorrow _ how could
there not be? But fate has been good to me. Almost a year to the
day after the abortion, a screaming baby girl with ear-piercing
good health was delivered into my arms. Two years later, we were
blessed with a robust son, now a delightful 1-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   There is something else. I know the results of the fetal autopsy
because they were sent to our home by mistake.
</P>
<P>
   According to the pathologist, the baby seemed to have
``crushing'' deformities probably owing to insufficient amniotic
fluid in the womb _ a not-uncommon consequence of genetic defects.
Without adequate room to develop, the baby's facial features had
grown distorted, and all the joints had been damaged, suggesting
that it would not have had the use of its limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must feel vindicated,'' a friend said after I told her the
news.
</P>
<P>
   Not really. Vindicated suggests there was a right or wrong
choice to make. But if there is a moral to my story, it is that
there is no moral. Embarking down the path of prenatal testing, I
did not foresee where it might lead, and I made my choice without
knowing what the future held.

   Five years ago, a much-wanted pregnancy at age 37 prompted me to
seek prenatal testing.
</P>
<P>
   I had of course been prepared for the possibility of bad news.
But the test results posed a harrowing dilemma unlike anything I
had anticipated or been warned to expect.
</P>
<P>
   The grainy picture on the ultrasound machine showed a glorious

<P>
   Every day Marcie Rothman, who is 51, takes three Body Wise
Female Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22
ingredients marketed as the natural answer to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to
stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along
with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot
flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone,
and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to
ameliorate mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for
essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric
acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis,
exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Rothman
figures that she has done everything she needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes
about food and nutrition, is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term
effects of menopause _ bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and
skin dryness _ depends on natural sources of depleted hormones,
along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>

   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional

<P>
   Every day Marcie Rothman, who is 51, takes three Body Wise
Female Advantage nutritional capsules _ an arsenal of 22
ingredients marketed as the natural answer to menopause.
</P>
<P>
   Soy protein is a selective estrogen-response modifier meant to
stabilize a woman's suddenly dwindling supply of estrogen; along
with black cohosh root, it is now a popular way to fight hot
flashes. Mexican yam is a trendy natural source of progesterone,
and passionflower, valerian root and kava are supposed to
ameliorate mood swings.
</P>
<P>
   The capsules also contain evening primrose oil and flax seed for
essential fatty acids, as well as gotu kola and alphaketoglutaric
acid, both of which are supposed to keep the brain sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Add vitamin pills, a calcium supplement to fight osteoporosis,
exercise, a no-smoking policy and a low-fat diet, and Rothman
figures that she has done everything she needs to do.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rothman, a former magazine researcher who now writes
about food and nutrition, is helping to support a $4 billion
alternative-remedy industry by dosing herself with nontraditional
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago she would have been at the fringe of consumer
society. Today, she is a foot soldier in a revolution that includes
members of the medical establishment, like Dr. Susan M. Love, who
co-wrote ``Dr. Susan Love's Hormone Dilemma,'' and Dr. David Heber,
the director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of
California, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Women, who buy the majority of medicines and medicinal
treatments, have a dizzying array of products at their disposal.
What these products do not have yet is quantifiable proof either of
quality or of effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   No regulatory agency enforces quality control of these
supplements, and there are not nearly enough scientific data to
confirm that their ingredients do what they profess.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a resurgence of a romantic idea about nature,'' said
Dr. Richard Friedman, the director of psychopharmacology at New
York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ``Like all ideology, it's
dangerous. The bottom line should be, if it works and it's safe and
effective, what does it matter where it came from? Molecules are
molecules.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1994, the government categorized dietary supplements as
food additives. Companies had to prove their products' safety to
the Food and Drug Administration, which could yank an item off the
shelf.
</P>
<P>
   But the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act put the
burden of proof on the FDA, which lacks the resources to police a
growing industry. Even proponents of these treatments worry that
women will end up with poor-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``My practical advice for right now is, go with one of the big
herbal companies,'' Heber said. ``Big companies have big insurance
liabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman added, ``It's buyer beware. You might get a treatment,
a potentially toxic substance or a placebo. It's Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   The standard alternative approach to dealing with the long-term
effects of menopause _ bone weakness, cardiovascular problems and
skin dryness _ depends on natural sources of depleted hormones,
along with specific remedies for short-term discomforts like hot
flashes.
</P>
<P>
   It usually involves a progesterone cream, of which Progest is
the oldest and most popular brand, and a phyto- or plant-derived
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
   Soy-protein powder is the phyto-estrogen of the moment. Women
usually mix it into fruit juice or milk twice a day, though many
who take it look forward to the day when an equivalent batch of
isoflavones are packed into a flavorless capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are mavericks like Dr. Uzzi Reiss, a Beverly Hills
gynecologist and anti-aging specialist who says he has a ``booked
practice, early morning to late at night'' concocting custom
hormone cocktails for his patients.
</P>
<P>
   If the herbalists and nutritionists believe that Premarin is
unnecessary, Reiss and his colleagues believe it is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
   Menopause is the wild frontier for alternative entrepreneurs,
with 1.3 million women very likely to be entering menopause this
year. But even established companies, like Transitions for Women,
which sells Progest cream and is based in Oregon, depend more on
patient testimonials than on research.
</P>
<P>
   Rothman's proof of efficacy is simple but also profound: She
began taking supplements five years ago, when her stress level
spiraled because of her parents' illnesses and a fractured romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had as much as a sore throat since,'' she said. Nor
any menopausal symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   The medical community prefers a broader sampling and has finally
acknowledged public interest by beginning to research popular
products.
</P>
<P>
   Love includes soy-rich foods and herbs in her daily regimen.
While ``we need more randomized, controlled double-blind studies,''
she said, referring to the ``gold standard'' in which half the
subjects receive an alternate remedy and half a placebo, she points
out that women are frequently prescribed drugs for which such
studies were not conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirement for gold-standard studies has to be seen in
perspective,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she keeps an eye on the emerging data. She had been
taking 25 grams of soy powder every day, for example, until a
recent double-blind study suggested 40 grams was optimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bumped it up to 40,'' she said, ``and the hot flashes
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Heber mixes four scoops, about 30 grams, of soy protein in a
drink twice a day because studies on animals suggest there is a
cancer-fighting, or antioxidant effect.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much trial and error in dosage and effectiveness;
for all the popularity of topical progesterone preparations, for
example, the FDA has yet to limit the progesterone content. What
works is often a matter of experimentation and individual
perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most hopeful sign,'' Friedman said, ``is that the National
Institute of Medicine has its agency of alternative health, and
they're doing studies now. You have to ask: If I'm going to put
this in my body, is it safe? What does it mean if a lot of
menopausal women say they're feeling better on something? Did it
work, or did they feel better because of the placebo effect?''
</P>
<P>
   Women are generally disinclined to wait for official answers and
prefer to apply their networking skills in an informal menopause
information exchange. There are several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This generation's distrust of authority has been heightened by
managed care _ having promised everything, medicine has delivered
far less.
</P>
<P>
   This generation also has a global perspective. Thanks to an
enhanced ability to travel abroad or on the Internet, women can
learn about other cultures and treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are a major revolution, 77 million of us thinking
we can change the world and live to 120,'' Heber said. ``An
internationalization of economies means we're getting an influx of
information from cultures that like natural remedies. In China,
they don't take Premarin.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that the baby boomers' curiosity, combined with
their mistrust of the pharmaceutical-medical establishment and the
torrent of data, has made the current menopause generation more
responsive to promotions for products that are, for the most part,
untested and unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say pharmaceutical companies ignore profit
projections. But drugs, unlike ``cosmeceuticals,'' undergo rigorous
clinical trials to win FDA approval.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is that women are doing their own informal clinical
trials, and that most doctors cannot keep up with them.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners who recommend alternative remedies urge women to
find what Love calls a ``guide'' who knows which companies make the
best products and how they are supposed to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't just take two of these and three of those,'' Love
said. ``You have to go to a herbalist, a naturopath, a traditional
Chinese doctor and have them match the herbs to your needs. You
hear what a friend takes, and you try that? Not a good idea. So go
to someone who knows what they're doing. That's your only
safeguard.''

SWISS GOLD OFFER IS LESS GENEROUS THAN IT SEEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The recent offer by Switzerland's banks to pay nearly
$600 million to Nazi victims whose plundered wealth wound up in
their vaults looks more generous than it is.
</P>
<P>
   Jewish organizations last week spurned the offer, holding out
for at least $1 billion _ a demand that on its face seems
excessive.
</P>
<P>
   But the offer and counter-offer need to be explained. Pre-World
War II currency values were about 20 times greater than those of
today's inflation-ravaged money. Several historians, including some
Swiss, have calculated the Nazi loot that found its way to neutral
Switzerland from 1939 to 1944 at $60 million, or $1.2 billion at
present-day values.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't include funds transferred by European Jews and
others for safekeeping before the war started _ an estimated $25
million to $30 million, which would be $500 million to $600 million
today. Some Swiss officials have acknowledged that many of these
accounts were not handed back to survivors or their descendants
after the war.
</P>
<P>
   According to several economists, the withheld accounts helped to
fund Switzerland's own notable postwar expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, some right-wing Swiss politicians and a number of
newspapers in that country charged that the banks' latest proposal
to repay victims of Nazi persecution or their descendants was so
lavish that it threatened to undermine the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some leading Swiss banks face legal action in the
United States following rejection of the $600 million bid to end
the controversy, which has gone on for three years. New York Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani has warned that the city may try to stop Swiss
financial institutions from doing business there, including dealing
on Wall Street. At issue is whether New York possesses the
constitutional right to do so since America's relations with other
countries are controlled by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But the struggle, with its deep emotional overtones, won't go
away. The Swiss claim they are now the victims _ as much as
anything else, they say, of domestic U.S. politics and of lawyers
trying to generate hefty fees for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   However, suspicion of the Swiss runs deep and not only in
America. ``The Swiss continue to give an impression of dragging
their feet and of not really seeing any reason to make up for their
past malpractices,'' declared the French news magazine Le Point.
``For this reason, they get little sympathy from the rest of the
world and do not deserve much.''

WARNINGS AMID OPTIMISM AT WORLD AIDS MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ With costly AIDS drugs now available to prolong life
for the fortunate few who can afford them, and new ones emerging
from advanced research laboratories, the 12th International AIDS
Conference opened Sunday amid restrained optimism coupled with a
profound awareness that millions of people face a fate worse than
the Black Death of the Middle Ages.
</P>
<P>
   There were songs of hope during ceremonies that marked the
opening of this scientific conference, where nearly 12,000 epidemic
fighters _ from militant activists to scientists doing basic
research _ have gathered from more than 100 nations.
</P>
<P>
   But there were warnings, too, that vaccines are at least 15
years away at best, that drug resistance and often unbearable side
effects from the most powerful of the new drugs are causing many
patients to discard them and that although prevention campaigns are
succeeding in a few countries, those successes are spotty, even in
so-called advanced nations like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Helene Gayle of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention underscored the extreme disparities:
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of us,'' she said, ``share the same dichotomy of emotions
_ the excitement brought by the tremendous progress in prevention
and treatment for many people and the overwhelming frustration and
sorrow of knowing that too many have not yet felt the benefits of
our advances.''
</P>
<P>
   Gayle is director of the federal agency's prevention campaigns
against HIV _ the virus that causes AIDS _ as well as all other
sexually transmitted diseases and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing sponsored by the American Medical Association,
Gayle reminded the world that even in America, the burden of HIV
infection is borne by many who can least afford to undergo
expensive treatments. African Americans and Hispanics now together
account for 66 percent of AIDS cases.
</P>
<P>
   She also said an increasing number of women now have AIDS, 22
percent of all reported cases. And although prevention programs
have had success in some localities, including in San Francisco,
Gayle reported that in 25 states, new HIV infection rates have not
declined during the past four years but have remained relatively
stable.
</P>
<P>
   Gayle said that ``continued health disparities between economic
classes,'' the nation's failure to deal successfully with substance
abuse and the ``intersection between HIV and the other sexually
transmitted diseases'' all stand in the way of accessible and
successful treatment.
</P>
<P>
   As for drug abuse, Gayle said the Clinton administration's
refusal to seek congressional support for needle exchange programs
coupled with drug treatment and counseling amounts to a reluctance
to rely on ``science to guide policy decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The punishment for drug use should not be death by AIDS,''
Gayle said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Dreifuss, the Swiss minister of interior, health and social
affairs, said drug users in Switzerland have access to free needle
exchange programs that have drastically reduced the sharing of
needles, a major source of HIV transmission.
</P>
<P>
   There is at least partially encouraging information on
preventing AIDS in newborn babies with the news that international
funds are being mobilized to pay for administering the anti-viral
drug AZT to pregnant women infected with HIV and to their newborn
infants, which greatly increases the chances that the babies will
remain free of the deadly virus if their mothers do not breast-feed
them.
</P>
<P>
   An even more successful new element in neonatal prevention was
reported by French researchers who have completed a new experiment
to improve the results _ for at least the most fortunate families.
</P>
<P>
   In the new trial, whose results will be published this week in
the Journal of the American Medical Association, the researchers
administered AZT, the first anti-viral drug used against AIDS, to
more than 900 pregnant women infected with the HIV during their
last four weeks of pregnancy, then delivered the babies surgically
by cesarean section before labor began. The drug was also given to
their babies for several weeks after birth.
</P>
<P>
   In Africa and Thailand, giving AZT to mothers during pregnancy
and to their newborns for up to six weeks after birth had already
cut the HIV infection rate in half for thousands of infants born to
infected mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Dr. Laurent Mandelbrot of France's National Center for
Health and Medical Research and his colleagues report that by
performing the cesarean sections on the infected mothers before the
onset of labor, they have cut the infection rate among the newborns
to less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In one series of 133 cesarean deliveries, for example, AZT
protection plus the elective surgery resulted in only a single baby
born with HIV, Mandelbrot said.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded that although the procedure could be recommended in
every country where access to safe surgery is widespread, most poor
nations can barely afford skilled surgery for their sickest people
_ let alone to protect babies from AIDS through high-tech
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Before last night's opening ceremonies, leaders of the
2-year-old International AIDS Vaccine Initiative announced that
they have received support from the World Bank, the British
government and the Rockefeller Foundation, along with a $1.5
million grant from Microsoft founder Bill Gates, to push for more
rapid vaccine research and development.
</P>
<P>
   With a scientific plan and a roster of international vaccine
researchers, the organization plans to enlist governments in both
industrialized and less developed countries to collaborate with
vaccine scientists in starting trials as soon as new vaccines are
shown to be safe and to induce immune responses in laboratory
animals.
</P>
<P>
   With $15 million raised so far, the group said $500 million in
vaccine research is needed to encourage drug companies to move
toward the eventual goal of profiting from AIDS vaccines, not just
drugs to treat the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   The opening session of the conference last night was unique in
one major respect. Its program _ as well all planning for the
global meeting _ was shared by leaders of both the scientific
community and by representatives of many of the world's community
activist organizations _ the same groups that have played an
effective role in prodding scientists to intensify their research,
drug companies to cut their prices and governments to outlaw
discrimination, promote prevention campaigns and even to legalize
needle exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many previous AIDS conferences interrupted by loud and at
times violent disruptions, this one was so programmed that European
ACT UP leaders could share the stage for a few minutes and men and
women living with AIDS from several countries could relate their
experiences calmly. The only ``disruption'' was in the form of a
few programmed moments for a noisy troop of horn-blowing protesters
carrying black and white banners proclaiming: ``AIDS Treatment for
All. ... Stop Drug Company Greed.''

NECK-AND-NECK GOP RUNOFF IN ALABAMA  
 BY MARC SANDALOW 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OPELIKA, Ala. _ The defiant chords of Lynyrd Skynyrd's ``Sweet
Home Alabama'' blare over a small tent's loudspeaker as Governor
Fob James strides to a small podium in this God-fearing hamlet
between Montgomery and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The governor is sweating heavily and the sleeves of his white
shirt are rolled up to his elbows. The sun has set, although it is
still 95 degrees and muggy. A supporter hands him an Auburn
University baseball hat, which he triumphantly places on his head
with his palm.
</P>
<P>
   Using no notes, the governor begins a colorful 20-minute tirade
against the ``monkeys'' and ``elitists'' who oppose him. He mocks
his rival's use of ``po-lit-i-cal op-e-ra-tives,'' drawing out each
syllable to accentuate both his drawl and his contempt. He
ridicules the Supreme Court for trying to deprive his constituents'
children the right to worship in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The scene, observed by two dozen cows in a field less than 100
yards away, is as Alabaman as the pulled pork barbecue and
sweetened iced tea being devoured by the all-white crowd of about
300. It conjures up memories of George Wallace and Kissin' Jim
Folsom, who dominated this state's politics in earlier decades.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the stuff of derisive Yankee stereotypes _ and to
a growing number of residents, a statewide embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   James is being challenged in a close runoff election Tuesday by
Winton Blount III, an Alabama version of a country Republican.
Although James' drawl, focus on religious issues and evangelical
righteousness have proven popular among the state's good ol' boys,
Blount insists that James' style is standing in the way of
progress.
</P>
<P>
   The race has evolved into one of the most closely watched _ and
colorful _ in the nation. At one point in the campaign, the portly
Blount recalled a when James ``danced around the stage like a
monkey'' to publicly mock the theory of evolution. James responded
by saying, ``(at least) I'm not a fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican runoffs used to be meaningless in the South, where
Democrats ruled for the 100 years after the Civil War. But for the
first time in history, more Republicans than Democrats voted in
primaries earlier this month, and the race between tomorrow's
winner and Democratic Lieutenant Governor Don Siegelman in November
is expected to be close.
</P>
<P>
   It is another pivotal moment in the evolution of a region where
civil rights and Civil War monuments stand side by side, and which
many of the nation's political leadership _ including the
president, speaker of the House and the Senate majority leader _
call home.
</P>
<P>
   The contest also reflects a nationwide struggle among
Republicans over whether social issues _ such as school prayer and
abortion or economic issues such as taxes and spending _ should be
the party's top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the simplest way to understand Alabama's politics is to
think of San Francisco _ Alabama is the opposite. Few destinations
on this planet are as politically and culturally distant from
Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Bible coloring books and gospel cassettes can be found in
Alabama's Piggly Wiggly supermarkets. Opposition to abortion, gun
control and gay rights are a given. Political candidates routinely
quote Scripture and complain that House Speaker Newt Gingrich is
too moderate.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in a curious way, Alabamans are experiencing a struggle
familiar to many San Franciscans _ in reverse. Just as moderate
liberals, like former Mayor Frank Jordan, have argued that the
city's liberal image scares off business, moderate conservatives in
Alabama insist that their own right-wing image keeps them in the
backwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time we had a leader who understood the language of
business,'' said Mobile roofer Jerry Lathan, using words remarkably
similar to those used in San Francisco campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image Fob (James) projects is that of an intolerant,
prototypical, southern redneck,'' added Lathan, who is working for
Blount's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   James has become the darling of the religious right for his
defense of of school prayer, at one point offering to lead prayers
in defiance of a court order and appealing a school prayer ruling
to the Supreme Court over the objections of his own attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fired both barrels,'' he said unapologetically when the
court refused to consider the case last week. ``If I had another,
I'd fire it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a much publicized statement that reminded some of former
Governor George Wallace's use of troops to keep blacks out of the
University of Alabama in the early 1960s, James threatened to use
the national guard to prevent the federal government from removing
a plaque of the Ten Commandments from an Alabama Courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's city newspapers have endorsed Blount, whose
father was the postmaster general under President Richard Nixon and
whose supporters say is the candidate who can attract investment
into the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't carry us back to the kind of stereotype that James
evokes,'' Blount said in an interview. ``I'll be talking about the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't threaten to call out the national guard in a futile
attempt that takes us back to those images of yesterday. I won't be
a governor who will say the Bill of Rights don't apply. We need a
governor who understand that our image is important to this
state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nuts'' responds James.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard there are some Southern Californians who are
embarrassed by y'all,'' he told a Chronicle reporter. ``I
understand your governor's race was an embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not more an embarrassment than Mayor Daley was to Chicago.
What you are listening to is an opponent who doesn't have an
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   James, like many southern politicians before him, seems to revel
in the charge that he is subject of Yankee scorn. Just as San
Francisco politicians are not ashamed to call themselves liberal,
James contends he is just a ``plain, old-fashioned conservative,''
in a radio commercial. ``And the big city newspapers never met a
liberal they didn't like.''
</P>
<P>
   James, like many Alabamans, is a Democrat who switched parties.
Whatever the label, there can be no mistaking the conservative and
religious leanings of this state, whose population of 4.3 million
people is slightly smaller than that of the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted earlier this month by the Mobile Register found
that nearly 3 out of 4 voters said a candidate's religious
background is an important factor, and 2 out of 3 respondents said
the Bible ``is the actual word of God and is to be taken
literally.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very conservative place,'' said Lorie Johnson, the
head of the Auburn College Republicans, a born-again Christian and
an avid James supporter. ``Students here are very conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson exemplifies the struggle between the old and the new,
saying she aspires to become a sportswriter for a national magazine
but feels it is inappropriate for women to work outside the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a mother is the most important job a woman can do,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest polls show the race is a dead heat. Regardless of who
wins, it is clear that Alabama is going through some changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Alabama doesn't get a progressive governor to lead us into
the 21st century, we're all in trouble,'' said Guy Hunt, who was
removed as Alabama's governor in 1993 for diverting campaign
contributions to his inaugural fund and is supporting Blount.
</P>
<P>
   A progressive governor for Alabama?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking liberal,'' he said. ``In Alabama, progressive
means using good common horse sense.''

GORDON WINS IN HOME STRETCH 
BY NANCY GAY
</HEADLINE>
   Chronicle Staff Writer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Jeff Gordon hasn't called California home since
he was 13 years old, but those Vallejo roots maintain a strong hold
on the thousands of NASCAR fans who packed Sears Point on Sunday
for NASCAR's annual Winston Cup stop here, the Save Mart/Kragen
350.
</P>
<P>
   They came out en masse _ crowd estimates were between 100,000
and 110,000 _ in part to worship the sport's most dynamic young
star, and Gordon did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   He cut his racing teeth on the dirt tracks at the Solano County
Fairgrounds in a quarter-midget, and 13 years later Gordon returned
to the North Bay and dominated an intimidating road race he had
always enjoyed but never conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to win this race for a long time and it's
always special when you've got that many people pulling for you,''
said Gordon, the pole-sitter who picked up a winner's purse of
$160,675 in his fourth Winston Cup victory this season. He also
regained the NASCAR Winston Cup points lead from Jeremy Mayfield,
who started fifth and finished 18th in the wild race.
</P>
<P>
   Stealing the lead late from surprise front-runner Bobby Hamilton
by sneaking inside on the tight Turn 11 hairpin curve, Gordon
pulled in front for good with only 10 laps remaining in the
217.56-mile race. He survived more bumping with Hamilton in the
same treacherous turn and eventually pulled away with a 3.11-second
advantage in the final lap as Hamilton's tires finally wore out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I drove the tires and the car right into the ground. I just
ran 'em plumb to death,'' said Hamilton, who drove his No. 4 Kodak
Chevrolet to second place.
</P>
<P>
   The brushes between the two drivers down the stretch were so
close that NASCAR officials radioed both drivers and their crews,
telling them to ``cool it a little,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   But it all made for brilliant racing, and a thrilling finish.
``He was putting up a fight,'' said Gordon, who passed No. 43 John
Andretti, No. 7 Geoff Bodine and No. 10 Ricky Rudd between laps 90
and 100 to get right behind Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I caught him, I drove real hard into Turn 11 and I got
underneath him,'' Gordon said. ``We were both kind of locking the
tires up. We bumped a little bit. I got by him, and he bumped me
back a little bit. Then he got by me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lot of fun racing him. It was real aggressive racing
that late in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was a crazy day, with five yellow caution flags flying
and eight drivers failing to finish, two of them going out because
of accidents (rookie Jerry Nadeau and veteran Terry Labonte).
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau, 27, vying for NASCAR Winston Cup rookie-of-the-year
honors, showed his wildness as early as Lap 1, when he slid off the
course and ran across the grass at Turn 2 before charging back onto
the track.
</P>
<P>
   He spun off the course a final time in Lap 14. Nadeau came wide
out of Turn 7 at The Chute, lost control in the beginning of the
swerves at Turn 8 and drove straight up the side of the hill,
plowing over the grass and burying the front end of his car into
the soft dirt bank.
</P>
<P>
   That mishap, which knocked Nadeau out of the race, brought out
the first caution. The nose of Nadeau's No.13 FirstPlus Ford _
co-owned by driver Bill Elliott and Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan
Marino _ was stuck in the soft earth and several attempts to
restart the engine proved futile.
</P>
<P>
   There was more concern about the condition of Nadeau, who may
have blacked out briefly upon impact. Clearly frustrated after the
accident, he also complained of some neck pain. As a precaution,
Nadeau was transported to Sonoma Valley Hospital for a CT Scan. He
was examined and released.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first corner was pretty exciting, that's for sure,'' said
Gordon, who held the lead for 43 laps but dropped back in the
middle of the race when his team lost valuable time in the pits.
``Jerry is an aggressive guy. He was just a little too aggressive,
so we were happy to make it through that.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gordon, there was reason to rejoice in his first career win
at Sears Point, one of only four tracks on the Winston Cup circuit
where he had never posted a victory. He had always loved racing the
road courses and did well on them, winning at Watkins Glen in 1997
and finishing in the Top 10 in his previous three races at Sears
Point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream come true for me. I never really raced out
here at Sears Point when I was a kid growing up here,'' said
Gordon, who makes his home in Mooresville, N.C., but had a
battalion of family and friends at Sears Point cheering him on.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he had truly come home. ``It's just a little bit
special, a little bit extra, plus it's a track that's tough to win
on and we wanted to win out here,'' Gordon said. ``It's just an
unbelievable feeling.''

ROCKIES' RALLY MEANS WILD WIN 
BY STEVE KETTMANN
</HEADLINE>
     Chronicle Staff Writer 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Sunday's mess of a game between the A's and the Rockies
offered a direct demonstration of why the designated-hitter rule
should be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   A's manager Art Howe did not enjoy playing under National League
rules very much, because his team lost an 11-10 game it should have
won. But when it comes to sheer craziness, the kind of stuff that
makes fans and everyone else grin and shake their heads, it was
hard to top watching the pitchers take their hacks Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be great to get back to our league where we can get
the ninth hitters out more easily than we've been getting the
pitcher out here,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   A's starter Tom Candiotti got things started. He came up in the
third inning and doubled to right, the first extra-base hit by an
A's pitcher since Ken Holtzman doubled against Texas on Sept. 15,
1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a fastball, middle away,'' Candiotti said. ``When I hit
it, I just tried to get to first as fast as I could. I saw the
right fielder stop and I said, `Oh, man, (he's) going to catch it,'
then it fell and I turned on the afterburners. I looked over and
saw four starters in the other dugout all standing up and clapping
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's wasted that leadoff double, but rallied for four runs in
the fourth to take a 5-3 lead. The Rockies countered that with
three runs off Candiotti in the bottom of the inning, helped by
errors by rookies Miguel Tejada and A.J. Hinch.
</P>
<P>
   The big hit? The A's walked No.8 hitter Jeff Reed to get to
Rockies starter Jamey Wright, who came up with two outs and runners
at the corners. Wright got all of a Candiotti knuckleball and
belted it into the left-center gap for a double to score both
runners.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the A's were in position to win the game. They broke
out for four runs in the top of the seventh, a rally highlighted by
Rickey Henderson's dancing off of third base to trigger a
run-scoring balk, and Matt Stairs' pinch-single to score two runs.
That made it 9-6 A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of those games where you say, `We should have won
12-4,' '' Candiotti said.
</P>
<P>
   The errors kept the Rockies in striking range, and they beat up
on the bullpen the way the A's had the day before. T.J. Mathews and
Mike Fetters (0-2) were in and out of there almost before you knew
it. Henderson's error in left on Dante Bichette's sinking line
drive made matters worse, but the key was Todd Helton's two-run
homer to right off left-hander Mike Mohler.
</P>
<P>
   That gave the Rockies an 11-9 lead and made it harder for the
A's to take over again. Ben Grieve came through in the eighth with
his second double of the day, scoring Rafael Bournigal, but that
rally fizzled when Mike Blowers struck out looking with two runners
on base to end the inning. Replays showed the ball was well
outside, despite home plate umpire Jerry Meals' verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked when he called it a strike,'' Blowers said. ``I
couldn't even believe it. That was a huge call. All the guys told
me it was pretty close to a foot outside.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, not getting a call from a National League umpire was
hardly the key to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was our downfall,'' Howe said. ``We don't make a
play to start the fourth inning, and we wind up giving up three
unearned runs. In the seventh, we couldn't get anyone out.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rockies manager Don Baylor did not enjoy the game as much
as he might have, despite celebrating his 49th birthday. ``I hope
no one stresses on their birthday like I did,'' he said. ``It was
back and forth.''

NASCAR FANS SEE THRILL RIDE 
BY TIM KEOWN
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SONOMA, Calif. _ Once a year they show up, more than 100,000 of
them, acres and acres of humanity stretching across the Sonoma
hills. They come early and stay late, with the goal of catching
occasional glimpses of colorful cars going at remarkable speeds.
</P>
<P>
   To some of us, the appeal can be puzzling. The assumption _ born
out by unscientific, walking-around research _ is that the majority
of NASCAR fans root for wrecks and some view the Civil War as a
temporary setback.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, Jeff Gordon showed why so many people are willing to
battle sun, wind, dust and infernal traffic congestion to witness a
Winston Cup race. In a way, Gordon let everybody in on the secret.
It took awhile, but the allure of NASCAR became apparent in the
final few laps of the Save Mart/Kragen 350 at Sears Point.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon pulled off what amounted to a perfectly executed
two-minute drill. You want excitement? There was Gordon, busting
his way past six cars in 14 laps to take the lead on a course that,
by his estimation, allowed drivers just one logical spot for safe
passage.
</P>
<P>
   For his crowning achievement, Gordon passed the leader, Bobby
Hamilton, on the 102nd lap. He turned Hamilton inside out with a
run to the inside of a hairpin turn _ Turn 11 to the believers _
and then jammed it hard on the straightaway.
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't know your front end from your rear, you could
appreciate the talent _ and the guts _ it took for Gordon to make
that move. Even if you walked in cold from a lifetime of
nonmechanical sporting pursuits, you immediately would have known
that Gordon's move into the lead was something that separates
regular guys from phenomenal performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming in, the first car you think about outrunning is the
24,'' Hamilton said, referring to Gordon. ``They're champions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon usually doesn't receive such ungrudging support from his
fellow racers. He is, of course, the fairy-tale prince in the world
of the self-proclaimed frogs. He's 26, photogenic and well-spoken,
and he races with an aggression usually reserved for I-80 on a
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   He also wins, which adds to the gall. Yesterday was his fourth
win of the Winston Cup season. It earned him and his crew more than
$160,000 and puts his race earnings at close to $1.7 million this
year. He also leads the series in points, which he won last year.
</P>
<P>
   (As evidence of Gordon's status, one of the ancillary amusements
provided to race fans Sunday was the chance to be photographed _
free of charge _ with a life-sized cardboard figure of Gordon that
just happened to be adorned with pink lace panties and lipstick.
Ancillary amusements, presumably, are also a big part of NASCAR's
allure.)
</P>
<P>
   Gordon doesn't seem to reflect the good-ol'-boy spirit of
rebellion, and auto racing has always been a rebel's pursuit.
NASCAR, however, is the great straddler; it has managed to gain
widespread appeal while retaining a portion of the politically
incorrect spirit. For one thing, where else in the world is
nicotine so gloriously exalted?
</P>
<P>
   Gordon does milk ads and appears on cereal boxes. He's also a
Westerner _ born up the road in Vallejo, where he lived until he
was 13. At that point, his father decided his son had outgrown the
limited racing opportunities in California. It was either
child-labor laws or safety laws, but the Gordons made the move to
the Midwest and it paid off.
</P>
<P>
   As a kid, Jeff raced in places such as Rio Linda, Fremont and
Sunnyvale, but he never had a reason to visit Sears Point. Since he
turned pro and began dominating the circuit, he has circled this
race as one he'd like to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dream come true,'' Gordon said. ``We've been trying
to win this race for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon and Hamilton jousted into that same Turn 11 through the
final laps, with Hamilton trying to make it work on rapidly
deteriorating tires. They bumped a few times, nothing too nasty,
and the NASCAR officials sent down word that the 24 and the 4
needed to calm it down.
</P>
<P>
   The news never made it to Gordon. It somehow got hung up between
Gordon's crew chief, Ray Evernham, and his driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know nothing of that,'' Gordon said, shooting a curious eye
toward Evernham. ``That was just good racing.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining himself, Evernham said, ``I got kind of busy, I
guess. I wasn't worried about either one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton wasn't bothered by any of it, and he offered this
pinpoint assessment: ``That's what makes our sport what it is _ we
got fenders.''
</P>
<P>
   The racers traditionally give the bulk of the credit to the
sponsors and the pit crew and the race promoters and the engineers
and the inventors of asphalt, but Gordon's contribution couldn't be
discounted. He thanked all the right people, but in the end, he was
the one making the tough decisions and having them work out.
</P>
<P>
   As one of the infinite number of racing T-shirts suggests, he
was driving it like he stole it. In this neighborhood, there is no
greater compliment.

GARDNER'S THREE-HITTER, SNOW'S SLAM PROPEL S.F.
</HEADLINE>
  By Henry Schulman 
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Last year's Giants were easy to figure out. They
were a merry band of castoffs from other teams that finally were
given a chance to prosper in a friendly environment under a
benevolent manager, who convinced them they were better than anyone
figured they were. Consistency was their byword: only one big
winning streak, no big losing streaks.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Giants are a puzzle. They are almost exactly where
they were at this time last year (48-35 now, 47-36 then), yet they
arrived here by winning 11 in a row and then losing 11 of their
next 18 when one of their big bats disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Which way do they go now that they face a tough week against the
Southern California teams, with three at Anaheim and three at home
against Los Angeles? If their past two games are a good barometer,
they must like their chances.
</P>
<P>
   After coming from behind to beat the Texas Rangers on Saturday,
they presented 36,664 fans at 3Com Park a neat little package
Sunday: seven runs in the first two innings, including a J.T. Snow
grand slam, a three-hit shutout by Mark Gardner against the
best-hitting team in the majors and a 7-0 victory that moved them
within 51/2 games of the first-place San Diego Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all of us have been disappointed with the way we've
been playing,'' Gardner said after tossing his seventh career
shutout. ``We haven't pitched well, we haven't hit well. It's been
the total package. We need to look at where we're going and see
what we need to do. We could easily be 10 games back at the
All-Star break with the teams we've got coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not if they play like they did yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The first three Giants reached in the first inning _ Darryl
Hamilton on a single, Bill Mueller on an error and Barry Bonds hit
by a pitch _ before Charlie Hayes drilled a fastball from 11-game
winner Aaron Sele past the pitcher's ear for a two-run single. Snow
followed with a sacrifice fly for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   An inning later, Hamilton walked, Mueller singled and Hayes
walked to load the bases for Snow, who with two out, skied a 1-1
Sele pitch high into the jet stream in left field that carried into
the bleachers for a grand slam. Snow had his 100th career homer and
a career-high five RBIs, and the Giants had a 7-0 lead that killed
the Rangers' spirits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that broke their backs,'' Gardner said. ``I don't
think they thought they were out of the game after the first
inning. To them, 3-0 is nothing. But 7-0 is a tough mountain to
climb.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow has been a revelation in the last week. He returned from
his mother's funeral on Monday not rusty after a wrenching ordeal
that caused him to miss five more games, but hot as a fireplace
poker. He has six hits in 20 at-bats since, including two doubles
and two homers.
</P>
<P>
   Snow believes that his many absences this season have yielded a
paradoxical benefit now.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're halfway through the season, but I still feel like it's
April or May because my season has been so choppy,'' he said. ``I
was gone four days in May, and then my shoulder was banged up, and
that cost me five or six starts. I was gone the last week for five
games. That all adds up to a chunk of a half a month or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``My focus is on the game again,'' Snow said. ``Not that it
wasn't before, but this game is hard enough when there's nothing
else on your mind. When your mind is clouded, I don't think you see
the ball and concentrate as well as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Concentration and focus also defined Gardner's start. He had a
one-hitter through seven innings and finished by facing just two
batters over the minimum. None of the three singles he allowed were
scorched. He walked none, struck out five and threw two double-play
balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a groove from the first inning, which has been his
nemesis inning,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``He was ready
from the time he got out there. We got three runs, which is an
instant cushion, but not a huge cushion against their lineup. After
the grand slam you saw Gardy more relaxed and determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates agreed that the slam helped
Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   ``After J.T. hit his grand slam, this was the flattest our team
has been in four years,'' Oates said. ``I'm not taking anything
away from Mark. He pitched a superb ballgame, but I don't think he
saw us at our highest intensity today.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounded like a backhanded compliment, but Gardner will take
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be right,'' the seven-game winner said. ``I don't
know. We'll never know. Maybe it did take the wind out of their
sails.'' &QL;

SMALL INVESTORS MISS OUT ON CONFERENCES' JUICY NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
It may be time for the securities industry to break from the
tradition of holding ``breakout sessions'' at stock conferences,
where most of the juicy stuff on companies is disclosed.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Equal access to information on public companies, or the lack
thereof, continues to be a thorn in the side of small investors.
</P>
<P>
   And well it should. There are inequities everywhere you look
when it comes to how news and information is disseminated about
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, stock conferences orchestrated by investment
banks and brokerages. Usually held at posh hotels and swank
resorts, these forums are frequented by fund managers and buy-side
analysts who can afford to pay the hefty prices of admission.
</P>
<P>
   These gabfests have become ubiquitous during the current bull
run, especially in San Francisco. Mayor Willie Brown, for one,
should be thankful for the boon to San Francisco's already robust
tourism business.
</P>
<P>
   These conferences usually feature three or four salons
(partitioned banquet rooms, really) filled with CEOs and CFOs
telling attendees how their companies are doing. They usually run
through their boilerplate presentations in a half-hour or so, while
number-crunchers in dark suits and skirts munch on muffins and
granola bars.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, the attendees adjourn to so-called breakout
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists currently are banned from the breakouts where most
of the news, essentially, breaks out. As you might imagine, the
financial press isn't thrilled with this policy. Nor should
investors be.
</P>
<P>
   The practice amounts to a two-tiered system for disseminating
important, if not technically ``material,'' information. You know,
tidbits like missed shipments, high inventory levels, a glitch at a
factory or a potential strike at a plant.
</P>
<P>
   It's stuff that can lead to bad quarters, missed earnings
targets or long-term performance problems. Stuff that you and I
might like to know, especially if you're a shareholder. (By the
way, I wouldn't be a shareholder because I don't invest in
individual stocks.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the investment banks and brokerages that host these
conferences say they can't allow the press inside these sessions
because the folks that run the companies wouldn't be as candid. Nor
would they be as specific when pressed about their operations and
income statements.
</P>
<P>
   Gee, isn't that the point? Why does a fund manager who owns
500,000 shares get preferential treatment over the investor who
owns 500 shares?
</P>
<P>
   Even if part-time investors can afford to pay the freight, they
aren't likely to be able to take time from their jobs to hang out
at the Ritz for four days.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should they have to. They shouldn't have to attend stock
conferences just to stay even with the big boys and girls from
fundland. Just let the journalists attend the breakouts or
eliminate them altogether. At least by letting reporters in,
whether they are from Dow Jones, Bloomberg News, The Chronicle or
the moon, they would have access to all of the company news, which
they in turn could deliver to Jane and Joe investor.
</P>
<P>
   This fair and sane approach would help level the playing field
between big and small investors, and it should improve the quality
of information that eventually hits the street.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the juice spilled during breakouts is often done so
informally, which sometimes lends itself to muddled messages. (OK,
I admit. I've managed to sneak into one or two of these on
occasion.)
</P>
<P>
   Fund managers and analysts who attend these sessions often give
accounts of the breakouts to journalists anyway, which creates room
for interpretation by the source. And sometimes, it results in
confusion.
</P>
<P>
   A real-life case in point: A hedge fund source says that he
attended a recent stock conference held by Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in
Boston at the Ritz-Carlton (naturally). The analyst says he
attended the breakout session for Preview Travel, an online travel
service based in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   According to the source, someone at the session asked if the
company would become profitable in line with analysts' predictions
(which are usually based on guidance from management).
</P>
<P>
   The answer, as reported by the source, was no. ``They sounded
like they were backing off from earlier targets for
profitability,'' the source says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that would be a pretty important bit of news. If it
were true.
</P>
<P>
   But for his part, Preview Travel chief executive Ken Orton says
he didn't utter any such thing at the breakout session.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Orton told me that he thinks the source ``slipped into
the wrong room.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; In addition, Wall Street analysts anticipate that Preview
Travel will climb into the black in the third quarter of the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
   And Orton says he ``is comfortable with the analysts'
projections.''
</P>
<P>
   So there you have it. Straight from the horse's mouth. But
wouldn't it have been easier if journalists were allowed to report
what is revealed during all presentations at these stockfests?
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the practice of holding breakouts should simply be
banned altogether. &LR;

INTEL BETTING ON `WARRIOR PRINCESS' CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAN FOST  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Intel Corp. thinks it has found a savior to help carry the company
out of its slow-growth doldrums: Xeon, or as one analyst calls it,
``the warrior princess chip.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Analysts say the Pentium II Xeon, which Intel officially starts
shipping to customers today, could add $1.5 billion to $3 billion
to Intel's revenues this year alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the growth Intel has going forward will be from these
chips,'' said Nathan Brookwood, a microprocessor analyst with
Dataquest in San Jose. ``This is really central to the company's
growth.''
</P>
<P>
   With Xeon (pronounced zee-on), the world's largest chipmaker
moves firmly into the high-end market. The new chip will run
servers and workstations, powerful computers used to manage
Internet traffic, large databases and fancy graphics applications.
</P>
<P>
   The chip should spur new competition between Intel customers and
IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and other makers of big
corporate computers who use a different kind of chip.
</P>
<P>
   Although Intel already supplies chips for some servers and
workstations, Xeon gives it a new capability. Instead of selling
chips for computers that cost $2,000 to $10,000 _ a market Intel
now dominates, according to Peter Kastner, an analyst with the
Boston-based Aberdeen Group _ Intel will now move into servers that
start at $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; That kind of money can chase the chip blues away. And Intel's
had plenty of blues lately _ a year of flat growth, slow sales in
Asia and an antitrust prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Even Intel's vaunted technology came into some question, as the
Santa Clara giant announced a delay in its next generation of
high-end chips, Merced.
</P>
<P>
   For a fleeting moment last week, Xeon looked like it might have
caught the same bug. Word leaked out that when ultra-powerful
computers tried to run four Pentium II Xeons at once, a flaw was
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   But Intel says such ``errata'' are routine, and while this one
will delay certain high-end computers several weeks, it won't stop
today's official launch of Xeon. Intel is working on a set of
software instructions to fix the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the most complex devices on the planet,'' said Intel
spokesman Bill Calder. ``There are 7.5 million transistors now on a
single piece of silicon smaller than the size of your thumbnail.
... We test, we check, we validate all the time. You can't possibly
have a perfect chip. All processors have errata.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger challenge for the Pentium II Xeon will be beating
some established competition in the high-end market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xeon is just a Pentium chip,'' said Jeff O'Neal of Sun
Microsystems, group marketing manager for products made with Sun's
Sparc chips _ one of Xeon's chief competitors. ``It's desktop
technology trying to play in the enterprise market. It looks from
this perspective like Pentium's last gasp. How far can they push a
20-year-old architecture?''
</P>
<P>
   Intel's customers don't see it that way. Kevin Joyce, director
of product marketing for Sequent, an Oregon company that makes
servers that cost from $50,000 to more than $1 million, said the
400 megahertz speed of the Pentium II Xeon beats Sun's speeds.
Sun's chips are based on RISC architecture, or reduced instruction
set computing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel, which has been lagging RISC performance, makes it clear
they are capable of delivering processors that out-perform RISC,''
Joyce said.
</P>
<P>
   Dataquest's Brookwood said the companies buying high-end servers
and workstations want the best performance available, and they're
willing to spend what it takes to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Intel notes that for its customers, the price-for-performance
equation improves with Xeon. Since 1996, Intel has sold the Pentium
Pro for big corporate computers. But last fall, Intel announced
that it was coming up with new names for its chips. It released the
Celeron for the sub-$1,000 PC market, and now it launches Xeon for
the high end.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentium II Xeon will sell for $1,124 to $2,800 _ a much
higher price than the desktop Celerons but comparably priced to the
Pentium Pro. Jonathan Joseph, analyst with NationsBanc Montgomery
Securities in San Francisco, said he expects Intel to sell 1
million Xeon chips this year and 6 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While PC sales have slowed, server and workstation sales are
soaring. Big servers are needed to keep up with the soaring growth
of the Internet. Big software programs require more-powerful
processors to run them.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's market clout, and its ability to run the increasingly
popular Windows NT operating system, give it a huge edge as it
moves into the high-priced arena, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Will Xeon push Intel out of the chip industry slump? Not by
itself. ``Intel's problems have largely been a result of a slowdown
in the PC market,'' analyst Joseph said. ``Intel now represents the
PC market. It's got 90 percent of that market. If prices are under
pressure, Intel will feel that pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Xeon, Joseph said, will only account for 5 to 10 percent of
Intel's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   While Intel won't say how much it expects to make from the chip,
it concedes that Xeon alone won't restore the phenomenal growth it
enjoyed until recently.

<P>
   ``There never is a silver bullet,'' said John Miner, Intel vice
president and general manager of the enterprise services group. ``A
nice portfolio of products allows us to ride the ups and downs of
the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Xeon was two years in the works, Miner noted.
</P>
<P>
   The name Xeon, like Pentium and Celeron before it, is the
concoction of Sausalito-based Lexicon Branding. Lexicon coined the
word after much effort, looking for something that adhered to
Pentium's Greek roots but also would give it a forward look.
</P>
<P>
   With the ``x'' at the front, Lexicon President and founder David
Placek said, the name evokes ``the next generation.'' With ``eon''
meaning a period of time, ``It all came together,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, a coined name can be the most effective route for
you,'' Placek said. ``We have found, when you have a new product
and you put a newly created word like `Xeon' on it, that says,
`Hey, this is new.' ''

INVESTORS BEWARE IN INTERNET CHAT ROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ARTHUR M. LOUIS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Maybe you have a big chunk of money to invest and are looking for
sage advice. Or you already own stocks or mutual funds and want an
expert to evaluate your holdings.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why don't you consult an unemployed actor, or a kid who dishes
out macaroni at a college cafeteria?
</P>
<P>
   Absurd, you say?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but such people _ and others with no greater expertise
_ dispense stock-market tips every day on investment-oriented Web
sites, sharing their wisdom with thousands _ perhaps even millions
_ of other investors.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest bull market of all time, coinciding with the
development of the Internet _ the greatest communications
revolution of all time _ has made investment chat rooms and
bulletin boards wildly popular.
</P>
<P>
   This worries the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
National Association of Securities Dealers and other regulatory
spoilsports.
</P>
<P>
   They point out that the investment advice you get on the
Internet may be misleading or false _ often deliberately so. What's
more, you can't depend on the regulators to protect you because
they monitor only a tiny fraction of all Internet chit-chat.
</P>
<P>
   Unscrupulous promoters have used the Internet to falsely hype
stocks they own, and shady short-sellers have used it to bash
stocks in an effort to force prices down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spreading publicity about a company or an individual has never
been easier,'' notes John Reed Stark, special counsel for Internet
projects with the SEC's Division of Enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Iomega, a disk-drive maker listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, and Comparator Systems, an over-the-counter company that
makes fingerprint-identification systems, are prominent examples of
stocks that went on wild roller-coaster rides because of Internet
postings.
</P>
<P>
   On May 3, 1996, an unidentified individual bombarded numerous
Internet bulletin boards with frenetic messages touting Newport
Beach-based Comparator:
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who hasn't gotten on this stock, get in now. Share
price jumped from 6 cents to 12 cents today!!!! Don't miss the
boat!!!!
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock is currently trading at .25 ... this morning's open
was .06. I think it will continue to rise to about one dollar.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, it reached a dollar on the next trading day _ May
6. More than a half-billion shares changed hands in less than a
week before suspicious Nasdaq officials halted trading on May 9.
</P>
<P>
   When Comparator opened for trading again more than a month
later, it sank back to 6 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet gives someone the ability to lend themselves an
air of legitimacy that is difficult to obtain in the outside
world,'' says Elisse Walter, chief operating officer for regulation
with the NASD.
</P>
<P>
   She adds: ``We try to remind people that the old rules still
apply: If something looks too good to be true, it probably is.
Don't let the speed with which information is available these days
make you act without careful deliberation.''
</P>
<P>
   A chat room is like a big cocktail party, where dozens of
investors exchange ideas in real time. You type your own comments
on your computer keyboard and read what others have to say on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   Bulletin boards are less fleeting and tend to be more
substantive. Investment buffs type out their opinions _ often at
great length _ and their messages go straight to the Web site's
archives, where other investors can read them at their leisure and
respond with their own postings.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of investment sites _ nobody knows exactly
how many _ but experts say the bulk of the gabbing evidently gets
done on four of them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Microsoft's www.investor.com.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; _ Motley Fool, whose chat rooms and bulletin boards are
accessible by typing in the key words ``Motley Fool'' on America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; _ &LR;   &LR; www.siliconinvestor.com, owned by Go2Net Inc., of
Seattle, which runs several Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; _ &LR;   &LR; www.yahoo.com, sponsored by Santa Clara-based Yahoo Inc.,
the Internet media company.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to demands from its customers, E-Trade Group, the
online discount broker based in Palo Alto, recently began rolling
out chat rooms on its Web site (www.etrade.com).
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; It is the first time any brokerage firm has done this, but it
may not be the last. Says Tom Taggart, a spokesman for rival
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.: ``We don't do it yet, but I wouldn't rule out
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade's chats currently are accessible to only about 10
percent of the firm's 400,000 customers _ mainly those who
expressed interest &UR; .  &LR; They should be available to all of them _ and
on a limited basis to noncustomers _ by the end of August, says
Kathy Levinson, president of E-Trade Securities.
</P>
<P>
   Although chat rooms are popular, their value as an investment
tool seems negligible _ to put it politely. Perhaps 80 percent of
the verbiage consists of social interaction between chat-room
veterans (``Winslow _ nice to see you again'').
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the conversation degenerates into irrelevant
wrangling, as when an Arab and a Jew recently launched a debate
about Palestine on an AOL investment site and wound up hurling
obscenities at each other in CAPITAL LETTERS.
</P>
<P>
   Even when someone actually chats about investing, the content is
generally superficial. (``Medical Manager Corp. is suddenly
popular.'')
</P>
<P>
   Chat rooms, it seems, serve mainly as group-therapy sessions for
people who are in the market and nervous about it.
</P>
<P>
   The bulletin boards are profound by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   A man hiding behind a screen name but identified in his AOL
profile as a junior high school teacher recently posted a
well-reasoned defense of Amazon.com Inc., the online book retailer,
on a Motley Fool bulletin board.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to other posters who wondered how the stock could go
from $9 to $100 in a year when the company has yet to turn a
profit, he argued that www.amazon.com is becoming a phenomenally
popular Web site _ a ``primary destination'' for Net surfers. That
means it might eventually be able to sell books ``at cost'' and
still make a profit by selling ads.
</P>
<P>
   That may turn out to be an entirely valid theory _ but consumer
groups warn that you shouldn't take any single statement as gospel
when researching securities on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The less-sophisticated investors, I think, take seriously any
well-written comment,'' says John Markese, president of the
180,000-member American Association of Individual Investors. ``We
tell people not to act on anything unless they confirm it from a
disinterested third-party source, such as Value Line or Standard &AMP;
Poor's.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter G. Crane, managing editor of IBC Financial Data in
Ashland, Mass., contends that investors can learn little of value
from chat rooms or bulletin boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``You aren't going to have a chief financial officer of a
company giving you inside data. You're far more likely to encounter
some hypester. Investment professionals and company insiders still
have a stranglehold on the really good information.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Forrest, head of online operations for Virginia-based
Motley Fool, insists that his service provides plenty of added
value.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had cases where people were talking about semiconductor
manufacturing in a chat room, and someone will log on from Korea
and tell you what's happening in the chip industry there,'' Forrest
observes. ``You're never going to get that from a security
analyst's report.''
</P>
<P>
   Forrest says Motley Fool bulletin-board readers were among the
first to hear that AT&AMP;T Corp. was seeking a marketing and
technology alliance with AOL _ something that was officially
confirmed in mid-June. ``There were several rumors on our boards
long before it happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Motley Fool does its best to keep its chat rooms and bulletin
boards free of fraud, Forrest says.
</P>
<P>
   Motley Fool employees are present in each of the six chat rooms
to monitor the conversations. Anyone who seems to be unjustifiably
hyping a stock will be booted. Those who appear to be spreading
false information about a stock _ a violation of federal securities
laws _ will be reported to the SEC.  &LR;   &LR;  The SEC and NASD have their
own Internet surveillance programs, but they are still rudimentary.
Evidently no one has yet been prosecuted or disciplined
specifically for statements they made in chat rooms or on bulletin
boards.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange declined to say what, if anything,
it does to combat Internet investment fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC says it relies primarily on tips and complaints from
outsiders to advise it of possible Internet abuses. But it also has
begun assigning staffers to monitor some chat rooms and bulletin
boards.
</P>
<P>
   Stark concedes that the SEC can never fully scope out the
Internet's ``infinite territory.''
</P>
<P>
   The NASD is spending millions of dollars to create a
computerized Internet surveillance program called Netwatch. The
rollout is scheduled for this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Netwatch will try to detect unjustified hyping or bashing of
stocks by brokerage firms and their employees, over whom it has
disciplinary authority.
</P>
<P>
   Once Netwatch is up and running, NASD's computers will
continuously scan the bulletin boards on the most-popular
investment Web sites. Bulletin boards lend themselves to this kind
of surveillance because the postings remain accessible for long
periods of time.
</P>
<P>
   Netwatch will not be able to scan chat rooms, where words come
and go too quickly for effective automated surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   The computer will search the bulletin boards for hyped-up catch
phrases such as ``easy money,'' ``get rich quick,'' ``can't lose''
or ``double in a month,'' regulation chief Walter says.
</P>
<P>
   If a company that doesn't get mentioned often on the bulletin
boards suddenly starts showing up frequently, that could serve as a
``red flag,'' Walter remarks.
</P>
<P>
   It may simply turn out that the company issued a surprisingly
good or bad earnings report, or announced a merger. But if there is
no obvious cause for the proliferation of messages, NASD will try
to determine whether someone is manipulating the stock.

ASTROID + STARS   HIT?
</HEADLINE>
 Q  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Producer Jerry Bruckheimer likes to refer to his
new exploding-asteroid movie, ``Armageddon, as `The Dirty Dozen' in
outer space.'' However, indie-film actor Owen Wilson (``Bottle
Rocket'') might have come up with a better description.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more like the Village People than `The Dirty Dozen',''
Wilson says, laughing. ``You've got the cop, the construction
worker, the motorcycle guy ... something for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Something for everyone'' certainly has been the guiding
principle behind the making and marketing of ``Armageddon''
(opening WeQesday), the second asteroid movie to hit theaters this
summer. Longtime action hero Bruce Willis is joined by ``Good Will
Hunting'' heartthrob Ben Affleck and a host of indie film actors,
including Wilson, Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi and Peter
Stormare. MTV poster child Liv Tyler is also on hand, playing
Willis' daughter and Affleck's lover while trying to make the movie
remotely palatable to female audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think just about everyone will find something to like in
this movie,'' Tyler says. ``Men, women, boys, girls, dogs, cats,
trees ...''
</P>
<P>
   Well, we're not completely sure that trees will appreciate
``Armageddon.'' We'll have to check with our Druid friends on that
and get back to you. And dogs and cats will have to wait until the
film comes out on video to enjoy its finer points. But there is no
disputing that all the other demographic bases are covered.
</P>
<P>
   ``This movie's aspirations are so clear,'' Wilson says. ``It
wants to be the BIG summer movie. It will accept nothing less.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only place ``Armageddon'' might not play is France.
Audiences at the Cannes Festival were heard snickering during a
poignant late scene between Willis and Tyler when 50 minutes of the
film was shown there in May. After the movie, Willis sarcastically
told the crowd: ``Thank you for enjoying the comical aspects of the
film. I'm glad to see that you take the end of the world so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Director Michael Bay was a little more forthright in his
assessment when we asked him about his Cannes reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Americans are the ones who always save the world,''
Bay says. ``You don't see `Francois' landing a space shuttle on an
asteroid, do you?''
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't. That job is left to Willis and Affleck. (Note:
These interviews took place before Willis and wife Demi Moore
announced their breakup.)
</P>
<P>
   Q: Having done three ``Die Hard'' movies and a few other
shoot-'em-ups, do you ever get tired of the action genre?
</P>
<P>
   Willis: They're still fun. I know a lot of actors labor over
what project to do next and how it's going to affect their careers.
But I just go with the fun thing to do. Fortunately or
unfortunately, that seems to be my criteria: Am I going to enjoy
myself?
</P>
<P>
   Q: What about being the father of a teen-age girl (Liv Tyler)?
That's a little twist compared to past roles.
</P>
<P>
   Willis: It was right on the edge of being mathematically
correct. But that's Hollywood. They stretch the truth a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Kind of like landing a space shuttle on an asteroid and
blowing it up?
</P>
<P>
   Willis: I don't know about landing on an asteroid, but there was
a giant asteroid that passed between the Earth and the moon four
years ago and if it had hit the Earth, it would have killed
everyone. No more newspapers. No more TV. No more movies. Just a
few survivors looking for a can of Chef Boyardee.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In my book, that would be the apocalypse. Doing this
interview must be a sign of the end of the world for you.
</P>
<P>
   Willis: I don't do many interviews any more. I was asked very
pointedly by the studio to help promote this film. That's why I'm
here.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is promotion and marketing now part of the territory for you?
</P>
<P>
   Willis: It's all commerce. But it's not part of my job. My job
is to be interesting in the film and to be entertaining. That's
all.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sounds pretty simple.
</P>
<P>
   Willis: I have a really low threshold for b-------. I've seen
too much in my time.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has that made you a cynic?
</P>
<P>
   Willis: I have a really cynical attitude about the world. And I
say cynical because it's the easiest thing to say. Because don't
you think the government is b-------? Don't you think they're all
lying to you and just taking the money? Well that's just one
example of all the things I think are screwed up in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sounds like you've got a list.
</P>
<P>
   Willis: The government could feed everybody in this country
tomorrow if they wanted to. They pay farmers not to grow food.
Please. There are people who are starving, and they could solve it
by pushing one button _ and they don't do it. I don't know why.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've often come out and supported Republican causes. Are
you still in that camp?
</P>
<P>
   Willis: I'm a Republican insofar as I believe in smaller
government, less government intrusion and lower taxes. I also
believe in a lot of Democratic principles like feeding people who
are hungry and taking care of old people who can't take care of
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some might say that those things could pose some
contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   Willis: Not necessarily. There are a lot of great ideas in the
U.S. government that have been around for a long time. They're just
not taken advantage of because people are making money from
special-interest groups. And until that changes, the government is
never going to be anything more than politicians taking money from
people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Actors often get a hard time for expressing political
beliefs. You don't seem to have any problem going public with your
ideas, though.
</P>
<P>
   Willis: I have a point of view as a taxpaying citizen. I pay the
highest tax rate there is. So I have every right to a point of
view.
</P>
<P>
   Q: As long as we've completely abandoned talking about the
movie, are there any other things in our society that irk you?
</P>
<P>
   Willis: Don't you think the media's out of control? I'd say
we're about five years away from televised executions on
pay-per-view. Right now, there are shows where people regularly
beat each other up and people tune in to see that. That's not that
far from killing people.
</P>
<P>
   You hear, too, all this talk about, ``We can't stop the drug
problem.'' Let me tell you something. Someone is making money off
the drug trade in the United States. They could stop it as soon as
they wanted. Declare war on drugs. I mean, really declare war and
go to Colombia and say, ``It stops now, or we're going to make you
the 51st state.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I could see that happening in a movie _ probably in one where
you're the star. But in real life ...
</P>
<P>
   Willis: Why not? Or why not take all the things that are killing
people _ all the poison, all the trash _ and just put it in a big
rocket and aim it at the sun? No more nuclear radiation, no more
waste. And yet they bury it in the ground in 55-gallon drums.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And yet, many politicians seem more concerned about the
content in movies and television than they do about a lot of the
issues you've raised. What's your response?
</P>
<P>
   Willis: I don't think anybody who goes to see films thinks
anybody in the movies is really dead or got hurt. But when you
watch the news and you see that chalk outline on the ground and you
see pools of blood or dead people stacked up like cordwood, that is
the most terrifying thing that exists in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And you can't seem to switch on the TV these days without
seeing those images or some car chase down the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   Willis: ABC is competing with CBS who's competing with NBC to
see who is going to have the most sensationalistic story so you'll
watch their version of that plane tumbling down the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Like I said before, it's all about commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Q: After ``Chasing Amy'' and ``Good Will Hunting,'' audiences
might be scratching their heads wondering what you're doing in an
asteroids movie.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: I know. It sounds like I'm selling out. The funny thing
is, I was never the guy who wanted to do indie films. I grew up
loving the ``Star Wars'' movies, ``Indiana Jones'' and ``Back to
the Future.'' You'd never catch me watching a boring foreign film.
I was Mainstream Man. On the set, I kept asking Michael Bay where
my NASA light saber was.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you look at ``Armageddon'' as your big break, since you
were hired for that film before ``Good Will Hunting'' came out?
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: Yeah, I always thought this would be the first movie
that a lot of people would see. My highest ambitions for ``Good
Will Hunting'' were that maybe a few critics would like it and it
would do break-even business because Robin (Williams) was in it. I
kept saying, ``Matty (Damon), if we just do $25 million, maybe
they'll let us do another movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: And now you've got an Oscar to show for it and everyone knows
who you are.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: It's weird, the whole fame thing. People are interested
in my personal life and I'm not even that interested in it. I guess
because you project this exciting, romantic life on the screen,
people presuppose you must have this dashing, exciting life at
home. And really, I'm just there sitting around watching TV with my
gut hanging out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since you're calling yourself Mainstream Man, do you plan on
taking your career in a pretty commercial direction?
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: I'd like to do a bunch of different things. Maybe
that's impossible, but I'm going to try. After ``Armageddon,'' I
did Kevin Smith's next movie, ``Dogma,'' which cost all of $4
million. Then I did ``Shakespeare in Love,'' a period movie with
Geoffrey Rush, Dame Judi Dench and Gwyneth Paltrow. And now I'm
doing ``Forces of Nature,'' a romantic comedy with Sandra Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have any desire to direct someday?
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: Definitely. And when I do, it will probably be more
like ``Good Will Hunting'' than ``Armageddon'' because that's what
I know about _ relationships between young people trying to make
their way through life. I know very little about meteor showers and
space ships.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Being a relatively unknown actor at the time, were you a
little intimidated when you walked on to the ``Armageddon'' set?
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: Are you kidding? I was extremely intimidated for the
first six weeks. I was intimidated by the scope of the movie, by
the money they were spending, by Jerry Bruckheimer, by Michael Bay,
who's very loud and brash until you figure him out ... And then
there's Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Peter Stormare, Steve
Buscemi. I felt like the absolute scrub rookie player on a veteran
all-star team.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So how'd you manage to come out of that?
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: I just tried to figure out how these movies work. Since
you're competing with all these visual and audio histrionics, you
have to simplify and choose one thing that's going to be the
centerpiece of your performance. For me, I made this character a
guy who has something to prove, so he was willing to take enormous
risks. And when they diQ't pay off, he'd feel hurt and want to take
even bigger risks just so Bruce's character would like him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did Willis offer any advice?
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: Bruce had some pearls of wisdom. (Laughing) I taught
Bruce a lot about acting and he taught me a lot about the benefits
of Viagra. So it worked out well.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's hard to picture you being intimidated. You seem pretty
outgoing.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: My mother always accused me of being in love with the
sound of my own voice. We'd be on road trips and she'd be like,
``STOP SINGING! Be quiet! You're talking just to hear yourself
speak!'' Which is probably true because I tend to like to
pontificate and ramble on about stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Matt Damon is much the same way. How'd you ever write that
``Good Will Hunting'' script together?
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: We have a thing where we'll both have an idea at the
same time and it's just a matter of which one of us talks louder,
that's whose idea wins out. Being around us when we write is tough.
You need earplugs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you have plans to write together again?
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: We'll be writing some stuff this summer. Matty's in
Italy making a movie, so in our spare time, we'll write.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Sure, you will.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: I know. It sounds bad. It's like I needed an excuse to
go to Italy, so I called up Miramax and said, ``Look. Send a
ticket. Matty and I are going to be working. Really. Don't worry.
And make sure you cover all our expenses.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you guys ever compare notes or shake your heads in
disbelief over your new status as sex symbols?
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: (Laughs) You know, I don't see myself as a sex symbol.
Sex symbols tend to be blond, sexually ambiguous ... you know, that
David Cassidy kind of thing. In a weird way, it's the 13-year-old
girls who define who's a sex symbol because they're the ones who
show up at events shrieking. You need a certain kind of
innocuousness to appeal to that. I don't think I have it. Matty, on
the other hand, might, with his blond hair.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So you'll leave the Teen Beat audience to him.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck: Yeah. If I'm going to be a sex symbol, I'd rather be
one for mature, 30-year-old women. In my opinion, they have better
taste anyway.

GENERATION XERS' FORTUNES FALL ON HARD TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Never before in history have so many twentysomethings made so much
money, so fast. Young luminaries of the digital revolution such as
Marc Andreessen of Netscape Communications, David Filo and Jerry
Yang of Yahoo, and Michael Dell of Dell Computer have become richer
than most kings and corporate titans of old.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But many of their generation, and a majority of men, are
slipping behind the economic status of young adults in previous
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Unless middle age unexpectedly revives their fortunes, many of
today's Generation Xers may be doomed to a standard of living worse
than their parents _ even though they are the most educated group
of young adults in America's history.
</P>
<P>
   The median (middle-ranking) worker aged 25 to 34 made $20,909 in
1996, according to the Census Bureau. But 20 years earlier, the
average Baby Boomer in that same age bracket made $23,123 (in 1996
dollars) _ 11 per cent more.
</P>
<P>
   (Some college grads this year are enjoying big salaries and
signing bonuses, but it's too soon to say how much young workers
overall are benefiting from the tight labor market.)
</P>
<P>
   Most forecasters didn't expect this pay decline. With the end of
the Baby Boom in 1964, birth rates declined. As the ``Baby Bust''
generation entered the labor market, the smaller supply of workers
was expected to boost their wages.
</P>
<P>
   Business Week predicted in 1979, ``Over the next 25 years (the
Baby Bust generation) will enjoy better entry-level jobs, higher
relative income, and faster promotions because of sparser
numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Generation Xers also should be earning more money thanks to
superior educational credentials. In 1996, 27 percent of adults
ages 25 to 29 had completed college, compared with only 19 percent
of that age group in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   But two recent studies by economists at the Bureau of Labor
Statistics demolish those optimistic scenarios with sobering
statistics:
</P>
<P>
   _ Real (inflation-adjusted) median earnings for young adults, 25
to 34, fell from $545 per week in 1979 to $463 per week in 1996, a
15 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   _ Young adults also lost ground relative to older workers. The
earnings of young adults fell from 95 percent of what all adults
earned in 1979 to 89 percent by 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many of the fastest growing occupations for young adults
between 1979 and 1996 were low-paying ones such as sales, service
and laboring jobs.
</P>
<P>
   With hardly any exceptions, ``members of Generation X appear to
be worse off by every measure'' than their Baby Boom predecessors,
concluded BLS economists Geoffrey Paulin and Brian Riordan in
Monthly Labor Review, a publication of the Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   These trends might not be so worrisome if young workers could
count on fat pay raises as they become older and more experienced.
But the evidence strongly suggests that the rewards of maturity
won't make up for youthful deprivation.
</P>
<P>
   Men who were 25 to 34 years old in 1956 enjoyed a 67 percent
jump in median income over the next 20 years. But young men in 1966
saw only a 37 percent rise in earnings as they aged over the
following two decades.
</P>
<P>
   And young men in 1976 went on to make a mere 17 percent more by
the time they reached middle age in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The slowdown in pay growth ``raises the issue of whether the
most recent cohorts will ever achieve incomes equal to those of the
earlier postwar cohorts,'' said Jared Bernstein, an economist at
the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given continued slow income growth and falling real wages, it
is very possible that the recent (and some future) cohorts will
have lifetime incomes inferior to those of their parent's
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   But now we come to a paradox: National surveys actually seem to
show an improvement over time in the happiness of young Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The General Social Survey, conducted by the University of
Chicago, shows little change in reported well-being of Americans
overall. But for those under the age of 30, the number saying they
were ``not too happy'' fell from 14 percent in the 1970s to 10
percent in the 1990s. The number calling themselves ``quite happy''
rose from 58 percent to 63 percent in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   British economists David Blanchflower and Andrew Oswald called
this change ``a large movement'' compared to the generally glacial
trends in such surveys.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation is that government income statistics
understate the economic advances of workers.
</P>
<P>
   Many economists claim official figures overstate inflation and
thus understate real pay gains by all workers, old as well as
young. But there's no consensus on just how far off the official
numbers are, or whether appropriate corrections would turn apparent
pay losses into pay gains.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible answer is suggested by the fact that the
growing happiness among young adults is confined almost entirely to
those who are not married.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that young men and women have benefited from
society's recently increased tolerance of those living outside
marriage, and from their consequent ability to live in less formal
relationships,'' Oswald and Blanchflower speculate.
</P>
<P>
   Oswald admits that their research raises more questions than it
answers. But it does confirm that income has only a small effect on
reported happiness. Were it otherwise, most twentysomethings would
be in a real funk today.

JEFFERSON VALUED PATRIOTISM, BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF THE
RIGHT  TO DISSENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRAD K. BROWN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pledge of Allegiance has long been a source of controversy,
particularly since 1954, when Congress added the words ``under
God.'' During and after the tumultuous 1960s, the pledge was
sometimes scrapped as a daily school ritual. Today, it has made a
comeback _ and with it the temptation to defiance, as expressed by
Fallbrook teenager MaryKait Durkee.
</P>
<P>
   What would one of the nation's fiercest patriots _ founding
father Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence
_ have to say about forcing people to recite it?
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that he would oppose a compulsory pledge,'' says
Andrew Burstein, history professor at the University of Northern
Iowa and a consultant and participant on filmmaker Ken Burns'
documentary on Jefferson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jefferson believed patriotism was voluntary,'' Burstein says.
And although he warns that translating Jefferson into late 20th
century civic culture has pitfalls, Burstein says that ``Above all,
he upheld the right of dissent. ... He did not fear rebellious
minds as long as the rights of others were not infringed upon.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is shared by Peter S. Onuf, the Thomas Jefferson
Memorial Foundation professor of history at the University of
Virginia, which Jefferson founded. Onuf believes the country's
third president, whose writings defined America's most cherished
principles, would not give blanket approval to all rejections of
patriotic observances.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jefferson would have been ``against hollow ceremonies and
demonstrations of obeisance and submission that would have reminded
him too much of the monarchical regime,'' Onuf says.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, Onuf adds, probably would have seen Durkee as someone
whose position was mistaken, but who was ``not threatening.''
Jefferson believed that ``the overwhelming good sense of the common
folk will preserve the republic, and it's a sign of our strength
that we don't have to persecute dissenters,'' Onuf says.
</P>
<P>
   Even the head of the National Flag Day Foundation acknowledges
that honoring the flag should be voluntary. Each year Louis V.
Koerber's Baltimore organization ``invites'' every American to take
time on Flag Day, June 14, to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and
``stimulate the patriotic experience.''
</P>
<P>
   But Koerber sounds a word of caution to citizens who reject what
he calls the most visible symbol of the country's Constitution and
Bill of Rights: ``Young people and others may not agree with where
the country is going, but where else would they like to go and live
and miss out on the freedom and protection of the United States?''

CALIFORNIA TEEN WON'T STAND FOR VOWING ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: MaryKait is cq)   By BRAD K. BROWN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Independence Day for 16-year-old MaryKait Durkee
came on April 1 this year. While some of the high school
sophomore's fellow students were playing April Fool's Day pranks,
Durkee was engaged in a dramatic protest _ one that embroiled her
in a battle of wills with school officials, touched a political
sore spot and catapulted her onto the national stage.
</P>
<P>
   On that day at Fallbrook Union High School, Durkee took a stand
_ or, more accurately, refused to stand and recite the Pledge of
Allegiance. It was an exercise of free will, said Durkee, who does
not believe in God. It was a rejection of a society, she said, that
has become too violent and a government that has become too
corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Durkee's teacher didn't see it that way; neither did her fellow
students, and they erupted. Her classmates urged world history
instructor Lutz Zastrow not to let Durkee ``get away with'' the
boycott. ``Give her detention,'' they urged.
</P>
<P>
   When the class had finished its recitation, Zastrow insisted
that Durkee stand up alone and say the pledge. Three times he made
the demand. Durkee loudly refused.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began one of the nation's most recent examples of a
continuing trend among students: defiance of the pledge and the
flag to which it's spoken.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights experts say pledge protests crop up periodically
and probably have ever since the text became a school ritual,
shortly after it was written by ordained minister and Freemason
Francis Bellamy in 1892. The matter is usually resolved quietly in
the classroom, said Dale Kelly Bankhead of the San Diego and
Imperial Counties American Civil Liberties Union, which is
representing Durkee in a free-speech lawsuit against the school
district.
</P>
<P>
   The flag, too, has been a chronic object of defiance, including
a recent art exhibit in which it was used as a doormat. And the
dissent has incited a backlash in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, incensed at what they say is abuse of the Stars and
Stripes for political and artistic reasons, are pushing for a
constitutional amendment to ban flag desecration. The Senate
Judiciary Committee approved the measure last Wednesday. Before it
becomes part of the Constitution, it requires two-thirds approval
of both the Senate and House, then ratification by three-fourths of
the states.
</P>
<P>
   The country is periodically seized by these displays of
patriotic fervor and reactionary measures, said constitutional law
expert Robert Cole.
</P>
<P>
   Far from symbolizing true unity and strength, however, they
reflect ``a kind of lack of confidence or loss of identity that
Americans have in what they really stand for,'' said Cole,
professor emeritus and associate dean at the University of
California's Boalt Hall School of Law in Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the symptoms of this sense of loss of direction has
been this drive to have people show more respect to the flag,''
Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego school officials have different ideas.
</P>
<P>
   They say Durkee was disrespectful to her teacher when she raised
her voice and have ordered her to serve four hours in Saturday
detention.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the incident, school officials also told
Durkee she must stand during the pledge _ silently, if she wishes _
or leave the room until it's over. The school subsequently relented
and allowed her to sit during the pledge, but said she will have to
stand or leave the room when classes resume next fall. Durkee
should have stood silently or left the room in the first place,
said Thomas Anthony, Fallbrook Union High School District
superintendent, and instead she chose to be disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   But Durkee and the ACLU say the edicts are a violation of First
Amendment rights to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy could have been avoided, Durkee stated in a
letter to school officials last month, if her teacher had respected
her right to sit quietly. She accused Zastrow of badgering her and
subjecting her to ridicule when he insisted that she recite the
pledge by herself.
</P>
<P>
   The school district doesn't have a constitutional leg to stand
on, said Jordan Budd, Durkee's ACLU attorney. The Bill of Rights
guarantees freedom of thought and speech, he noted. ``You cannot be
punished for exercising your constitutional rights,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Law expert Cole agrees. So does the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   If Durkee is acting on principle, Cole says, the school district
cannot compel her to reject her beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Durkee also seems to be within her rights to reject the school's
offer of asking her to stand silently or leave the room _ which
``constitutes a serious burden on (people) because it singles them
out a great deal,'' Cole said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Durkee has already been singled out more than she ever
dreamed possible. The bespectacled honors student, a self-described
loner, has had her story picked up by newspapers across the country
and debated heatedly on talk radio.
</P>
<P>
   At school, the temperature runs even higher. Fallbrook Union
High sits near the Camp Pendleton Marine base in a staunchly
Republican enclave of 30,000 people. After the incident, 400 out of
3,000 students signed a petition urging Durkee to stand for the
pledge. Students also wore buttons that read ``We Stand.''
</P>
<P>
   Durkee's mother, Ann, says the imbroglio has had a profound
effect on her daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was hurt to think that people think that she doesn't
care'' that people have died for the country and its ideals, says
Ann Durkee, who has been handling calls for MaryKait. ``But my
daughter doesn't see the flag or the Pledge of Allegiance in itself
as the ideals that these people went to war and fought for and died
for. What they fought for, Ann Durkee says, ``is the freedom to
live in this country. And the freedom that goes along with that is
to think and to act freely.''
</P>
<P>
   MaryKait ``is a thinking, responsible person'' who ``will not be
coerced into anything, including patriotism,'' said Ann Durkee, who
thinks the school detention order is unjust and should be
rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Anthony, for his part, says that until he
receives an opinion from the school district's lawyers, the
disciplinary action stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to respect their (the Durkees') opinion,'' Anthony
said. ``I don't want to violate her rights.'' On the other hand,
``the issue is respect, not only to the teacher but to the flag.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect,'' professor Cole countered, ``is something people
have to give voluntarily. It's not something that the government
can coerce out of you.''

ANOTHER SHOT AT ENDING HIV
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Pat Duffy, a gay, 48-year-old communications
worker, heard that the first Phase III tests for a potentially
AIDS-preventing vaccine were under way, his first thought was:
Hallelujah!
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about it and would certainly, if it were offered,
stick my arm out and have them pump me full of it,'' he said. ``It
looks so wonderful that they've got something that might work
against this insidious disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But Duffy _ like most AIDS health-care professionals and
scientists _ doesn't see AIDSvax, a vaccine that has produced HIV
antibodies in 99.5 percent of 1,200 test subjects so far, as the
ultimate answer to the pandemic that so far has claimed nearly 12
million lives worldwide. Health experts say another 30 million are
infected with HIV, the AIDS-causing virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody is cautiously optimistic whenever there's a
new development, whether it's a new drug, a new treatment or
whatever _ and rightfully so,'' said Corri Planck, spokeswoman for
the Los Angeles Gay &AMP; Lesbian Center. ``The drugs (developed so far
for AIDS treatment) haven't worked for everyone. And they're very
expensive. This could be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Wil Strain, a treatment advocate for AIDS Project Los Angeles,
agreed. ``I think it's far too soon to tell how well (AIDSvax) will
work,'' he said. ``Vaccines have been in development for many
years, and there has been a lot of skepticism.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 25 potential HIV vaccines have been tested worldwide, but
this one _ developed by the South San Francisco-based VaxGen Inc. _
is the first to reach this level of testing. Phase III testing is
the final step before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will
consider approving a drug for medical use.
</P>
<P>
   VaxGen kicked off its testing last week in Philadelphia. The
firm will test the vaccine over the next three years in at least 30
sites _ including Los Angeles and San Francisco _ on 5,000
volunteers who are considered to be at high risk of contracting the
AIDS virus, such as gay men and women whose sexual partners are
infected. Two-thirds of the volunteers will receive AIDSvax, and
the other one-third will receive a placebo.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers will receive injections every six months for 30
months, with a six-month follow-up period.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines are being administered at clinics specially set up for
testing throughout the United States. Because of FDA rules and
security worries, VaxGen will not say where the clinics are
located. The vaccine is not available at AIDS Project L.A., the Gay
&AMP; Lesbian Center or at UCLA, sites where AIDS counseling and other
services are offered.
</P>
<P>
   People who want to volunteer to be a part of the trials can call
VaxGen at (650) 225-7000 or access its Web site at: www.vaxgen.com.
</P>
<P>
   VaxGen has trumpeted its vaccine as the first medication that
can prevent HIV infection. But what makes it different from other
vaccines that have been developed _ and have failed? What makes
some scientists think AIDSvax may be at least a partial antidote to
the spread of HIV?
</P>
<P>
   Like other vaccines, AIDSvax is designed to train the human
body's immune system by creating antibodies to protect itself
against HIV infection. The vaccine uses a genetically engineered
protein from the surface of the virus, rather than the naturally
occuring virus, which scientists say should llay fears that
instead of preventing HIV infection, the vaccine could actually
cause it in test subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Injecting the recombinant protein stimulates production of
antibodies that attack any invading HIV, preventing the virus from
binding to and infecting healthy T-cells, immune-system cells that
fight infections.
</P>
<P>
   Many U.S. scientists are skeptical about AIDSvax because it is
based on gp120, a vaccine the National Institutes of Health decided
in 1994 was too weak to study further. But Daniel T. Reiner, chief
operating officer of VaxGen, said AIDSvax is a substantial
improvement on gp120.
</P>
<P>
   The first tests of AIDSvax began in 1990; chimpanzees inoculated
with the vaccine _ and later with HIV _ still show no sign of
infection, said company spokeswoman Donna Walters. More than 1,200
humans have received the vaccine, and it has prevented HIV
infection in nearly all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The only side effect has been a temporary sore spot on the arm
where the vaccine is injected, as with many vaccines.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very optimistic,'' she said. ``We've passed every hurdle
so far.''
</P>
<P>
   If the vaccine does prevent HIV infection, it could mean a lot
to Los Angeles residents, as well as people all over the world,
said Chuck Henry, director of the Los Angeles County Office of AIDS
Prevention and Policies. In the 17 years since the AIDS virus was
first isolated and tracked, 24,361 Los Angeles County residents _
men, women and children _ have died of the disease. About 12,500
people are living with full-blown AIDS, about 11,500 have tested
HIV-positive, and another 16,000 or so are believed to be infected
but have not yet been diagnosed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot to do from the prevention standpoint,'' Henry
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the results of the AIDSvax trials, they will be a
success in the eyes of scientists because they will help fill in
the blanks as progress is made toward a prevention vaccine, say
medical experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ... need to go ahead with wide-scale testing and be willing
to fail,'' Dr. Richard Marlink, executive director of the Harvard
AIDS Institute, said in a 1997 statement. ``We're not going to
succeed if we're not willing to fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ronald T. Mitsuyasu, director of the UCLA AIDS Care Center,
echoed that belief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this vaccine will prevent AIDS,'' he said. ``It
may diminish it, reduce the proportion of people who will get the
infection, though, and that's good. But there will still be the
question of how to identify those it will help. No matter what the
results of the testing, it will obviously raise more questions,
which is natural for scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``But research is never a waste. Whatever we learn from this
study ... will advance the course of science. I think it will be a
next step in the development of other vaccines. And one of them may
prevent AIDS. I would hope to see such a vaccine within 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a small step toward the solution, but one many also fear
will send the wrong message. If science does come up with a vaccine
that can prevent HIV infection, in as little as three to 10 years,
does that mean a return to the sexual free-for-all of the late
1960s and early '70s?
</P>
<P>
   Duffy, who admits to having indulged in ``wild and
indiscriminate'' sex with strangers in his late 20s and early 30s,
said he hopes not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just really concerned that this vaccine is going to give
everybody a false sense of security,'' he said. ``Even if they
could give me something to prevent AIDS, I wouldn't slut around
anymore. I'm older and wiser and monogamous, and I know there are
other diseases out there you can get. Until they can actually track
people and make sure it works, we're going to have to be vigilant
and responsible. This vaccine may be a great thing, but it's not a
license to go back and not practice safe processes.''

 Telecom Rivals Say Pac Bell's FCC Plea Part of Hidden Agenda   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
Pacific Bell made a plea to the Federal Communications Commission
this month: Ease up on some of rules blocking it from deploying
ADSL (a fast, new Internet service that runs over plain old phone
lines).
<TEXT>
<P>
   But rivals say Pac Bell has a hidden agenda _ sneaking into the
long-distance market before it opens its local telephone monopoly
to competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``This application is part of a plan to circumvent the
requirements they are subject to under the Telecom Act,'' said MCI
spokesman Richard Severy.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell spokesman John Britton said that criticism is
misplaced. Although three other Baby Bells _ Bell Atlantic, US West
and Ameritech _ have asked the FCC for permission to carry ADSL
over long-distance, Pac Bell didn't make that same request.
</P>
<P>
   Britton said all Pac Bell wants is freedom from certain rules
that hinder it from competing with ADSL startups like Covad and
North Point Communications, which are cherry-picking business
customers who want high-speed Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data has become the king of the network,'' Britton said. ``We
can't meet the data needs of our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   But rivals are suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   They fear that if Pac Bell expands its current ADSL pipeline, it
could start serving long-distance customers who talk instead of
type _ by taking advantage of new technology that can turn voice
traffic into digital bits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same facilities (Pac Bell) wants permission to install
could, with minor adaptations, be used to complete long-distance
calls,'' said AT&AMP;T spokesman Wayne Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   But Britton said, ``Pacific Bell isn't going to try to sneak
voice into packets and make it look like data.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC will consider ADSL petitions against the backdrop of
last week's AT&AMP;T-TCI merger _ which has been billed as a way for
AT&AMP;T to buy the wires into your home.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought deregulation made things simpler!

 Investors Don't Bite at Aurora Foods IPO   By Carol Emert  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Wall Street had a tepid reaction to yesterday's initial public
offering of Aurora Foods Inc., the San Francisco maker of such
well-known supermarket products as Duncan Hines cake mixes and Aunt
Jemima frozen waffles.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of the highly leveraged company ended the day at $21,
exactly the price at which they began trading. They peaked at a
lackluster $21.13 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of 14.5 million shares by a syndicate led by Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co. raised $304.5 million for Aurora and its owners. The
company also completed a $200 million debt offering yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Schaadt, a food industry analyst with Fourteen Research
Corp. in New York, attributed the stock's unenthusiastic reception
to the fact that Aurora carries $700 million in debt from its
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Packaged food is also a highly competitive business, Schaadt
said. ``There is a lot of competition for shelf space in the
supermarket, so it could be investors are saying, `Let's wait and
see''' how the company performs.
</P>
<P>
   The economy may also be a factor. Food stocks tend to perform
better in down economies, while during boom times ``there are other
things that are more exciting'' such as technology and retailing
stocks, Schaadt said.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora was created in a recent deal that united the seven
branded food lines of two predecessor companies: Aurora Foods
Holdings and VDK Foods Holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The new company's strategy is to continue buying and reviving
underperforming, non-core food lines, according to a Securities and
Exchange Commission filing.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora's predecessor companies showed significant progress in
turning around brands within a year of acquiring them from larger
food companies, the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of Celeste frozen pizzas, for example, rose 8.6 percent
after dropping 16.8 percent in the year prior to the acquisition,
when the line was owned by Quaker Oats, the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   And Sales of Mrs. Paul's frozen seafood products, formerly owned
by Campbell Soup Co., rose 7.1 percent after falling 9.2 percent
the prior year.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora's other brands include Log Cabin, Mrs. Butterworth's and
Van de Kamp's. All of the lines, which have been acquired since
September 1995, occupy the No. 1 or No. 2 position in their
categories, the filing said.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the products last year generated net income of $25.3
million on sales of $874.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora's principal pre-IPO stockholders include three investment
firms that had stakes in Aurora's predecessor companies: San
Francisco-based Dartford Partnership LLC, New York's Fenway
Partners Inc. and McCown De Leeuw &AMP; Co. of Menlo Park and New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Wilson, a Dartford partner, is Aurora's chairman and chief
executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Aurora Vice Chairman Jamie Ardrey also a Dartford
partner,declined to comment on the offering yesterday, saying the
company remains in a quiet period for the next week.

`BAYWATCH' WANNABES TAKE THE BUOYANCY TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``e'' entertainment news 
 file)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The rational mind would dismiss it as a
``Baywatch'' promotional event at San Jose State University, and a
small and chintzy one at that.
</P>
<P>
   But one person's gaseous promo event is another's career
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Eight women and seven men answered the call Thursday afternoon
to strut their stuff on dry land, in hopes of nailing an appearance
on the syndicated beach and babe TV series.
</P>
<P>
   The two winners _ Divini Bean, 21, of Portland, Ore., and Steve
Niyati, 22, of Danville, Calif. _ secured bit parts on a future
``Baywatch'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost bit parts. Bean and Niyati will be part of a
montage of campus winners shown at the end of an episode, said
contest producer Jason Altshuler, who works for a Los Angeles
marketing firm called Mediamix.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also compete with winners from 24 other ``Baywatch
Search On-Campus'' competitions in a national finals contest.
</P>
<P>
   The national winners presumably will qualify for two-bit parts
in a ``Baywatch'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 San Jose contestants auditioned in street clothes at the
San Jose State University student union, before a mildly curious
throng of, oh, seven or eight spectators who wandered into the
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   One contestant, who said he was a kickboxer, promptly shed his
street clothes, down to his red boxer shorts, for the sake of
television art and science.
</P>
<P>
   He had his shirt half unbuttoned by the time Altshuler finished
giving him his instructions: ``In mime, tell the judges why you
should be in `Baywatch.''' A moment later, he was prancing around
the stage with his jeans bunched at his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   No David Hasselhoff, he. Nor a Steve Niyati, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The kickboxing trouser-dropper lost. So did the gushy blonde who
strode onto the stage, grasped the microphone and proclaimed, ``I
love the world, and I'd love the world to love me, too, and I just
want to share my bliss with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark-haired, brown-eyed Niyati is a senior and soccer player
at San Diego State University. He said he decided to audition in
San Jose after a friend won the ``Baywatch'' contest in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Niyati has no acting experience _ apparently not a huge
impediment _ and said he calmed his nerves during the audition by
recalling his time in the public spotlight as an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those opportunities,'' he said. ``You always, in
the back of your mind, wonder if you could be some kind of actor.
You get an opportunity and you take it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bean, a well-tanned blonde who certainly appears to be gifted
with outstanding lifeguard credentials, actually followed the
contest from Portland after losing in the final rounds there, only
days before the San Jose competition. So she must be an avid
``Baywatch'' fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said, ``actually, I really only watched part of the
show once.''
</P>
<P>
   She might be forgiven because she's a professional swimsuit
model who resides part time in Australia. But then, you can't
escape ``Baywatch'' in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Altshuler seemed disappointed by the sparse turnout in San Jose.
By contrast, he said, a crowd of 3,000 watched 400 contestants vie
in New York City. Even Portland produced 250 contestants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe `Baywatch' and San Jose don't mix,'' sighed Altshuler.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Sage, a 28-year-old model from Santa Rosa, Calif., might
have agreed, though for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sage, a tall, slim brunette, arrived ready to compete. But she
decided to sit it out after she glanced at the small crowd and the
panel of judges headed by a San Jose radio disc jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I phoned my agent,'' she said. ``I found out who the judges
were. They aren't actual agents or actors or actresses. It just
didn't seem legitimate to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. Sage said she'd actually saved a life once. It was an
auto accident, not a near drowning, but you didn't see Pamela
Anderson Lee or Yasmine Bleeth pitching in to help.

`BAYWATCH' WANNABES TAKE THE BUOYANCY TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: This story also moved in the ``l'' lifestyle news file)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The rational mind would dismiss it as a
``Baywatch'' promotional event at San Jose State University, and a
small and chintzy one at that.
</P>
<P>
   But one person's gaseous promo event is another's career
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Eight women and seven men answered the call Thursday afternoon
to strut their stuff on dry land, in hopes of nailing an appearance
on the syndicated beach and babe TV series.
</P>
<P>
   The two winners _ Divini Bean, 21, of Portland, Ore., and Steve
Niyati, 22, of Danville, Calif. _ secured bit parts on a future
``Baywatch'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost bit parts. Bean and Niyati will be part of a
montage of campus winners shown at the end of an episode, said
contest producer Jason Altshuler, who works for a Los Angeles
marketing firm called Mediamix.
</P>
<P>
   They'll also compete with winners from 24 other ``Baywatch
Search On-Campus'' competitions in a national finals contest.
</P>
<P>
   The national winners presumably will qualify for two-bit parts
in a ``Baywatch'' episode.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 San Jose contestants auditioned in street clothes at the
San Jose State University student union, before a mildly curious
throng of, oh, seven or eight spectators who wandered into the
ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   One contestant, who said he was a kickboxer, promptly shed his
street clothes, down to his red boxer shorts, for the sake of
television art and science.
</P>
<P>
   He had his shirt half unbuttoned by the time Altshuler finished
giving him his instructions: ``In mime, tell the judges why you
should be in `Baywatch.''' A moment later, he was prancing around
the stage with his jeans bunched at his ankles.
</P>
<P>
   No David Hasselhoff, he. Nor a Steve Niyati, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   The kickboxing trouser-dropper lost. So did the gushy blonde who
strode onto the stage, grasped the microphone and proclaimed, ``I
love the world, and I'd love the world to love me, too, and I just
want to share my bliss with everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The dark-haired, brown-eyed Niyati is a senior and soccer player
at San Diego State University. He said he decided to audition in
San Jose after a friend won the ``Baywatch'' contest in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Niyati has no acting experience _ apparently not a huge
impediment _ and said he calmed his nerves during the audition by
recalling his time in the public spotlight as an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those opportunities,'' he said. ``You always, in
the back of your mind, wonder if you could be some kind of actor.
You get an opportunity and you take it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bean, a well-tanned blonde who certainly appears to be gifted
with outstanding lifeguard credentials, actually followed the
contest from Portland after losing in the final rounds there, only
days before the San Jose competition. So she must be an avid
``Baywatch'' fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said, ``actually, I really only watched part of the
show once.''
</P>
<P>
   She might be forgiven because she's a professional swimsuit
model who resides part time in Australia. But then, you can't
escape ``Baywatch'' in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Altshuler seemed disappointed by the sparse turnout in San Jose.
By contrast, he said, a crowd of 3,000 watched 400 contestants vie
in New York City. Even Portland produced 250 contestants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe `Baywatch' and San Jose don't mix,'' sighed Altshuler.
</P>
<P>
   Sandra Sage, a 28-year-old model from Santa Rosa, Calif., might
have agreed, though for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sage, a tall, slim brunette, arrived ready to compete. But she
decided to sit it out after she glanced at the small crowd and the
panel of judges headed by a San Jose radio disc jockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I phoned my agent,'' she said. ``I found out who the judges
were. They aren't actual agents or actors or actresses. It just
didn't seem legitimate to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. Sage said she'd actually saved a life once. It was an
auto accident, not a near drowning, but you didn't see Pamela
Anderson Lee or Yasmine Bleeth pitching in to help.

A'S HOSE OFF OVERHEATED GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY SCHULMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Two San Francisco police officers stood guard outside the
umpires' locker room after Thursday's game, which is all you need
to know about the state of Giants' relations with the men in blue
right now.
</P>
<P>
   A's closer Billy Taylor stood on the mound after the last out,
mocking Barry Bonds' ``raise the roof'' hand gesture, which is all
you need to know about the state of the Giants' game right now.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland won 5-2 to complete an unusual split in the transbay
interleague series. The Giants won the two games at the Oakland
Coliseum, while the A's took the two at 3Com Park. While the A's
left for Colorado after Thursday's finale, the umpiring crew of
Mike Winters, Hunter Wendlestedt, Larry Poncino and Steve Rippley
stuck around to work this weekend's Giants' series against the
Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   It should be an interesting weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A day after Rippley ejected Giants catcher Brian Johnson for
arguing balls and strikes, Winters tossed pinch-hitter Charlie
Hayes for the same offense in the eighth inning Thursday. Hayes did
not take it well. In fact, he charged Winters and needed to be
wrestled to the ground by manager Dusty Baker, who ended up on the
turf himself, along with first-base coach Carlos Alfonso and
several others who rushed over to restrain Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   A clump of players and coaches, including Barry Bonds and Orel
Hershiser, had to drag a screaming Hayes to the dugout, which is no
easy task. He's a big guy. When Hayes walked to his car 40 minutes
later, he was still steaming about Winters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to go f_ myself,'' Hayes said. ``The next one who
says that to me, I'm hitting in the mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters' response: ``I don't think I said that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were trailing 4-2 and had two runners on and two out
when Baker sent Hayes to pinch-hit for Ramon Martinez. Taylor was
called in to face Hayes and fell behind 2-1. The big right-hander
then threw a slow bending slider that Hayes thought was inside.
Winters called it a strike, drawing an incredulous look from Hayes.
</P>
<P>
   On the next pitch, Hayes hit a meager pop-up to third to end the
inning. Baker sent Hayes out to play third base, and on his way
there he began arguing with Winters. That's when the chaos began.
Winters ejected Hayes, who then went after the umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was popping off, and he continued to pop off after he
popped up,'' Winters pointed out. ``He continued it long enough to
where he was ejected. It was simple. I had enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Winters might have had too much of Hayes' body on him had Baker
and Alfonso not restrained the player. Baker and Alfonso were
losing the battle when the manager finally dragged Hayes to the
ground as the crowd of 23,069 began chanting, ``Charlie! Charlie!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a guy go after an umpire like that,'' Taylor
said. ``It was a good pitch, a late breaker on the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker said that Hayes' actions were not premeditated, but a
reaction to Winters saying something he was not supposed to say.
``That's when Charlie went off,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   As Hayes walked to his car after the game he insisted that he
merely engaged Winters in ``normal conversation about balls and
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him he made a bad call,'' Hayes said. ``The balls he
was calling were strikes, and the strikes he was calling were
balls. He said, `Go f_ yourself,' and that's when I snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never disrespected him. For some reason, the umpires think
they can disrespect us. I've been thrown out of four games, and
that guy has thrown me out of three of them. I just want right to
be right, and wrong to be wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of who was right and who was wrong in the Johnson
/Rippley and Winters/Hayes affairs, the Giants will have to find a
way to coexist with the crew this weekend. The Rangers are the
American League's best-hitting team, with a .294 average, and
though umpires are pretty good about not holding grudges, they are
human.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day is different,'' Johnson said. ``You hope everybody
can be professional enough to do our jobs. We are, as players, you
hope the umpires can too.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was still upset about his ejection a night earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, there are no checks and balances as far as the
umpires are concerned. They're able to do whatever they wish,'' he
said. ``It's very similar to the depiction of the cop twirling his
baton and saying, `I can do anything I want.' If we fail to do our
jobs, we get demoted or fined. There's nothing comparable for the
umpires. You never see them get fined.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hayes episode breathed life into what had been a dull game.
The A's took a 4-0 lead in a bizarre fourth inning in which Shawn
Estes threw two wild pitches and walked three A's, including
pitcher Jimmy Haynes with two out, while catcher Brent Mayne
committed a passed ball and made his second wild throw to second in
as many games.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes was the first A's pitcher to draw a walk since Ken
Holtzman in 1973. Rickey Henderson followed with a two-run single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell asleep in the middle of the third inning and woke up in
the Twilight Zone,'' Estes said. ``Balls were falling all over the
place. It was just like pinball.''
</P>
<P>
   Good pinball, maybe, but bad baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants scored on J.T. Snow's double, a wild pitch and Bill
Mueller's sacrifice fly in the fourth, and singles by Snow, Stan
Javier and Mayne in the eighth. But Taylor struck out Bonds looking
for the second straight game to end it. Taylor then mocked Bonds'
hand gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anybody says,'' the pitcher said. ``There
has always been a rivalry here. When two teams from the same area
play, it always means a lot.'' &QL;

DOWNTRODDEN TEAM TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM KEOWN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let's presume the Warriors have a plan. Let's presume Garry St.
Jean and P.J. Carlesimo know more than we do. Let's presume they
understand the importance of employing men who can dribble
competently and shoot the ball from outside the key.
</P>
<P>
   Working under this presumption, Antawn Jamison will be a fine
addition to a team that needs several more.
</P>
<P>
   There has to be something else coming. The Warriors can't go
into the season with a backcourt of Bimbo Coles and Tony Delk and
team it with a frontcourt of Jamison, Erick Dampier and Donyell
Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you can say about that lineup: Jamison would be able
to perfect his specialty _ offensive rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   The key to this for anyone who cares about the Warriors is
ignorance. Ignore history. Ignore the pang of anxiety that hit when
you saw them hand Jamison the No.4 jersey _ Chris Webber's old
number. Ignore the past two Warriors No.1 picks, static forwards
Todd Fuller and Adonal Foyle. Ignore the memory of Joe Smith, who
was on hand the last time the Warriors were surprised by the
outside shooting of a 'tweener forward in predraft workouts.
</P>
<P>
   Because if you leave history out of it _ and if you let your
mind leap ahead to a Terrell Brandon-for-Latrell Sprewell trade _
it's impossible not to like Jamison.
</P>
<P>
   The Warriors unfurled Jamison to a mostly unsuspecting lunchtime
crowd at the Oakland City Center on Thursday, and it was
immediately apparent why the Warriors fell all over themselves to
get this guy.
</P>
<P>
   He says he wants to be here, and he looks sincere when he says
it. He wants Carlesimo to get in his face, because he is used to
that and respects a coach who will not accept losing and
lackadaisical play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not one of those coaches who kisses your butt because
you're making this much money or because you can shoot a
basketball,'' Jamison said.
</P>
<P>
   If P.J. wants more mustard on the passes, that's what he'll get.
</P>
<P>
   And that's not all. When he heard about Sprewell's choking of
Carlesimo, Jamison says his first thought was, ``How can a player
do this to a coach?''
</P>
<P>
   When he was a kid, Antawn and his father used to play
one-on-one, and the loser had to cut the grass. ``I've been cutting
the grass for some time,'' Albert Jamison said Thursday. His tone
was more begrudging than joking. You get the feeling the old man _
he's only 41, but still _ wouldn't mind another crack at the kid,
and that's a good sign.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, it's hard to presume the Warriors are going to
do anything right. For a long time, we have been conditioned to
think the worst of the Warriors. It's Pavlovian: If the Warriors
did it, it must be wrong. This habit came about after years of
practice, and one unfortunate discovery: Thinking the absolute
worst about the local NBA entry didn't come close to matching
reality. Our imaginations simply weren't big enough.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive the digression, but the best comparison comes from a
bridge-construction project in Iowa. The project was well under way
when a worker went to his supervisor recently and said, ``Yo, boss,
this is one fine project we got going, but this here bridge isn't
going to make it all the way across that water.'' The worker was
right; the bridge was being built over the wrong stretch of river.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Warriors _ always building something that stands no
chance of reaching land.
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to Jamison, let's agree on one thing: It's best not
to get caught up in the tender psyche of Donyell Marshall. What
does Jamison's presence mean for Marshall? Who cares? Not to cast
aspersions on Marshall _ he improved drastically, played hard, all
that _ but there isn't anything there to convince the Warriors
they're set in the frontcourt for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   After all,  &LR; somebody &LR;  had to score last year, and it just so
happens that a lot of the scoring fell to Marshall. He did it, and
congrats to him, but the respective talents of Marshall and Jamison
are not mutually exclusive. They can play together, and if Marshall
ends up being the first guy off the bench, then the team has
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Jamison came to town wearing a sharp four-button suit with an
angel pendant pinned to the right lapel. Asked to explain the
importance of the angel, Jamison got passionate:
</P>
<P>
   It reminds him of the bad times his family has endured, the
hardships and trials. It reminds him of his grandmother, who died
about five years ago. He used to wear it everywhere, even pinned to
his shoes on the court. That proved impractical _ it kept coming
loose and falling off on the court _ so he began holding it in his
hand until it was time to put it in his locker and take the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The angels are watching over me every day _ they were
definitely watching over me (Wednesday night),'' Jamison said. ``I
wear it everywhere. It signifies a lot for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what the Warriors are counting on _ angels. Lord
knows they need them, and maybe they found one. In fact, let's
presume that, too. Sometimes it beats trying to figure out the
plan.

WIN 98 GETS TEPID RESPONSE  
 BY JULIA ANGWIN AND JON SWARTZ 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - WINDOWS 98   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Windows 98 got a lukewarm response at many Bay Area computer
stores when it hit store shelves at 12:01 a.m. yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   A few die-hard techies lined up at stores to buy the
controversial software. But most midnight shoppers saved their real
enthusiasm for $98 computers that CompUSA stores around the country
were offering in limited supply as Windows 98 promos.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good deal but I don't know if it's worth it,'' said
Nicole Wright, a stockbroker who waited in line for 12 hours at
CompUSA in San Francisco to buy a $98 computer.
</P>
<P>
   She was one of the lucky ones _ each CompUSA store only sold 10
cheap computers. The rest of the crowd had to console themselves
with steeply discounted modems, CD-ROMS and armfuls of the $89
Windows 98 software.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came because I thought it would be sold out tomorrow,'' said
Doc Casey, who spent part of his vacation from Taiwan at the San
Bruno CompUSA store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to install all of them as soon as I get home,'' he
said, balancing a stack of Windows 98 boxes under his arm.
</P>
<P>
   However, the software rush was a pale imitation of the frenzy
surrounding the launch of Windows 95 _ when customers around the
country lined up just for the software and 1 million copies flew
off the shelf in the first day.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft would not predict sales of Windows 98 _ an update to
Windows 95, which runs most of the world's personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nowhere near the demand for Windows 98 (as for
Windows 95),'' said Al Thoman, owner of Friendly Software in San
Carlos. ``Computer users aren't as pressed to upgrade their
software this time.'' Analysts predict Windows 98 sales will lag in
comparison to Windows 95, which gave the Windows operating system's
``look and feel'' a dramatic face-lift.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, much of the hype around Windows 98 has nothing to do
with technology _ but is driven by the government's antitrust case
against Microsoft that focuses on Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   `If it weren't for the Justice Department, this would be the
nonevent of the year,'' said Jeff Tarter, editor of Softletter, an
industry publication in Watertown, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put this under the get-a-life file,'' he said. ``Are you sure
that half the people in line weren't Justice officials?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many of the two dozen midnight customers at Fry's
Electronics in Palo Alto _ which was not offering any cheap
computer promotions _ were there to gawk, not to shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was curious about what the turnout was going to be,'' said
Denver Lough. ``But there's no one here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lough showed up at 11:30 to make sure he got a place in line
after hearing about the expected crowds on the radio. He also was
trying to escape the construction noise outside his house. He was
the first person in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is it is a tempest in a teapot,'' said Lough, a Los
Altos consultant who bought Windows 98 to fix some bugs on his home
PC.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Devore, who works next door to Fry's, said he was drawn to
the store by the big searchlights that lit up the sky. But when he
got there, he saw an empty parking lot and few shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to see the hype but I didn't see any hype,'' said
Devore, a 25-year-old self-proclaimed Macintosh user.
</P>
<P>
   While it was practically a ghost town at Fry's, it was like the
``The Rocky Horror Picture Show'' for nerds at CompUSA stores,
vying for the $98 PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a light drizzle, stiff wind and temperatures in the low
50s, a crowd of 400 people lined up outside the San Bruno store.
Several hundred also showed up at the San Francisco store.
</P>
<P>
   Although the twenty-something crowd in San Bruno was quiet and
well behaved, two policemen and store employees lurked nearby to
make sure no one cut in line.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Louie of San Francisco spent his time in line leafing
through a computer manual.
</P>
<P>
   Louie said he wanted the modest software upgrade because of
improvements such as being able to run DVD drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear it's also a lot faster and more efficient for booting
my system up,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Others in line had different things on their mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good place to pick up computer chicks,'' joked Brian
Beaver of San Francisco. ``I would buy (Windows 98) one way or
another, but I came here mainly because it's an event.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft shares fell $3.38 to $101.56 in trading of 22.1
million, making it the second most active U.S. stock. Earlier, the
shares climbed to a record $106.88.

AIRLINE PASSENGERS FEEL A CARRY-ON SQUEEZE  
   
   
  
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - BAGS   By Kenneth Howe  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
U.S. airlines are starting to crack down on excess carry-on
baggage, but so far their policies are only being selectively
enforced.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On crowded flights, passengers are likely to be limited to no
more than two carry-on bags _ with briefcases, laptop computers and
large purses counting as one. But on less crowded flights, the new
two-bag limit may be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines say they need to limit carry-on bags to ensure
safety and speed up boarding and exiting on increasingly crowded
flights.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, United Airlines plans to take stronger action,
strictly limiting the size of any carry-on bag to 45 linear inches,
a measurement derived from adding the height, length and width of a
bag.
</P>
<P>
   United is testing at least two devices to screen for oversized
bags. At San Francisco International Airport, it is using a
laser-beam that measures bags as they exit the X-ray machine.
</P>
<P>
   The lasers work, but psychologically, they should go in front of
the X-ray machine so that a bag can be rejected as too big before
it passes security, said Greg Couper director of airport services
for United.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unconsciously, passengers feel if the bag goes through
security screening, it has passed some rite of validation and
they're hanging on to it,'' said Carol Holmes, assistant to the
president of the Association of Flight Attendants.
</P>
<P>
   United said it has been more successful with a low-tech device
being tested in Los Angeles International. A plexiglass template is
bolted to the front of the X-ray machine with a 10-inch by 15-inch
hole cut in it. If the bag fits though it can be carried aboard. If
not, it must be checked.
</P>
<P>
   The new policies pose a problem to some travelers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real drag,'' said musician Erik Torjeson, who had a
guitar damaged when he was forced to check it as baggage on a Delta
Air Lines flight.
</P>
<P>
   Torjeson is a guitarist with Starship Featuring Mickey Thomas, a
spin-off of the rock group Jefferson Starship. Yesterday, he was
allowed to carry his $1,000 guitar onto a United flight. ``These
are delicate instruments and we travel all the time,'' he said. ``I
can't check this as baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration ordered airlines to come up
with their own &UR;  &LR; carry-on baggage policies 10 years ago, but until
recently, the airlines had little incentive to write detailed rules
or enforce them.
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, carry-on baggage has become a big problem.
``It's like weeds in the garden _ it's just kept growing on us,''
said Couper.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is the growing popularity of rolling carry-on
luggage, or ``wheelies.'' Luggage-makers discovered the wheel about
four years ago. They have made carting carry-on to the gate much
easier, especially for the old and the very young, who may have
lacked the strength to sling much baggage over their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the carry-on glut is that there are simply
more passengers on each flight. The average flight today is 70 to
75 percent full, up from 60 to 65 percent just a few years ago,
according to the Association of Flight Attendants.
</P>
<P>
   Couper said United is concerned about the issue for three
reasons. Too many carry-on bags leads to chaos in the aisles. The
added time spent finding extra space for too many bags also delays
flights. Finally, there is the safety issue.
</P>
<P>
   The AFA, a flight attendants union, estimated in 1996 that as
many as 4,500 passengers and 3,600 flight attendants a year are
injured by falling carry-on bags.
</P>
<P>
   At a conference on carry-on bag injuries last year, a passenger
recounted how a laptop computer fell on her head, resulting in a
compressed spine. Another told of being struck by a piece of metal
luggage, which left the victim needing a cane to walk for the next
two-and-a-half years.
</P>
<P>
   ``And these are only the reported accidents,'' said the AFA's
Holmes. ``We don't know how many injuries go unreported.
</P>
<P>
   Couper said leisure and business travelers are equally likely to
carry on too much. But he said that oversized carry-ons are a
bigger problem than too many bags.
</P>
<P>
   United studies have shown that 16 to 17 percent of passengers
bring carry-ons that are too big.
</P>
<P>
   But only 3 to 4 percent of travelers bring more than two
carry-ons. United said it has reduced that figure to 1 to 2 percent
since it started enforcing its two-bag limit in May.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, carry-on constraints could ease as reconfigure
some of their craft to allow for bigger bins, and start flying
bigger planes with roomier overhead compartments. But those
solutions will take time.
</P>
<P>
   The flight attendants would like the FAA to come up with a
standard rule for carry-ons.
</P>
<P>
   But the FAA has no plans to do so. ``Our regulations say that
bags must be properly stowed,'' said FAA spokeswoman Kathryn
Creedy. ``But there needs to be flexibility between airlines.'' She
noted that different carriers use different aircraft, which have
more or less space in the cabin. Moreover, each carrier can
configure the same aircraft in different ways.
</P>
<P>
   One Congressman is taking the issue into is own hands.
Representative William Lipinski, D-Ill., has introduced H.R. 3064,
which, among other things, would prohibit passengers from bringing
more than a single carry-on bag on board a commercial aircraft.
However, neither the FAA, the airlines nor the flight attendants
support the legislation.

IF ONLY CHINA LISTENED TO ZHAO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Those needing a metaphor for President Clinton's
travails in China have been obliged by a 78-year-old guy who could
have been more than a contender, and still has more guts than the
typical pols inflicted on citizens from both ends of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Zhao Ziyang was in public view as a big shot, he
was in tears, but he was also still the general secretary (as in
Big Enchilada) of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhao was in
Tiananmen Square on the evening of May 19, 1989, pleading with the
leaders of the young democracy demonstrators (whose cause he had
both cynically and genuinely championed) to declare victory and go
home. He failed, lost his power, lost his effort to avoid martial
law, and lost in his attempt to prevent the horror and outrage that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Even in impotence and house detention, however, Zhao has never
quite shut up, as was apparent last week when a letter he wrote his
former comrades in the Chinese leadership earlier this month
surfaced in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   What was remarkable about the letter was not the criticism of
his successors that was emphasized in news accounts. What was
remarkable was its confidence and its optimism as Zhao publicly
urged today's leaders to use an acknowledgement of the colossal sin
that Tiananmen represents to reap great benefits for China's
future, internally and externally.
</P>
<P>
   Follow his train of thought, keeping in mind that his intended
audience is mostly Chinese and that the letter was addressed to the
party's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
   This onetime economic modernizer and Deng Xiaoping underling
thinks Clinton's visit is a decided ``turn for the better'' in
Sino-US relations at the beginning of what he also thinks will be a
period of even more enormous scientific and economic progress in
China.
</P>
<P>
   In this exciting era, Zhao is without any doubt that additional
personal and political freedom is simply inevitable, or, as he put
it, ``The trend of democracy cannot be blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if it's inevitable, if it's also in China's interest, what
is the point, Zhao wonders, about clinging to an official version
of the mass killing that began on June 4, 1989, that is wrong,
known to be wrong by the people, a blot on China's international
image, and an obstacle to its future progress? Or, as he wrote last
month:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past the Communist Party of China has rectified many
historical mistakes. Now we are facing the arrival of a new, open,
democratic, and information-age era. What reason do we have to
reject the will of the people, cling to the June 4 problem, and
block our road to democratic politics?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't drag June 4 into the next century to resolve. The time
is ripe now to resolve the problem. We should give it a fair
appraisal. We should not carry a historical burden into the next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more to the point, Zhao argued that expiation in the form
of reversing the official line about Tiananmen, namely that it was
a proper response to a ``counter-revolutionary'' threat, would
``bring 100 benefits and no harm'' and get rid of most of the
``factors'' abroad that are ``restricting China economically,
politically and culturally.''
</P>
<P>
   One clue that he is right can be found anytime Chinese
officials, big-shot or little-shot, are asked about the massacre.
They go on auto-pilot, the official line being that the verdict was
correct and is reaffirmed in party and government gatherings all
the time. They simply cannot handle the followup: If the verdict is
so solid, how come it keeps coming up?
</P>
<P>
   This suggests two courses of action for now. One, recommended by
smart dissidents, is that Americans from Clinton on down make sure
they tell the Chinese how they feel about the massacre. What is
requested is not mindless confrontation but skillful
identification.
</P>
<P>
   The other is for Clinton and other top officials to make sure
they inquire about Zhao's health, with obvious implications. My
guess is the Chinese will be anxious to assuage any concern.
</P>
<P>
   After all, before Zhao, the party boss was a guy named Hu
Yaobang, another economic modernizer with democratic tendencies who
got bounced when Deng Xiaoping yanked the leash.
</P>
<P>
   In April of 1989, Hu died. As the news was released, some young
people gathered to pay tribute to him and to his progressive ideas
_ in a corner of Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   We all know what happened next.

NET FIRMS FIXING ACHILLES' HEEL IN SOFTWARE  
 BY JON SWARTZ 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - ATTACK   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
A group of Internet companies led by Netscape Communications,
Microsoft and RSA Data Security are expected today to announce
software programs to correct a potentially dangerous flaw in their
computer products.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a pre-emptive strike, the companies are posting free
``software fixes'' on their Web sites so that corporate users of
their server-software products are immune from the so-called
Million Question Attack.
</P>
<P>
   The server products contain cracks in their design that
conceivably make them susceptible to complex attacks from crafty
hackers. A successful break-in would make encrypted, or specially
coded, software on computer systems vulnerable to theft.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Labs researcher discovered the security threat, which the
firm immediately deemed ``theoretical'' with no evidence of
reported virus attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cryptographer Daniel Bleichenbacher said it would be nearly
impossible to exploit the security flaw. He said a successful
hacker attack would have to send up to 1 million messages to a
targeted Web server over several days to crack a computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Netscape and others say they are taking the
cyberthreat seriously. Netscape, IBM and Microsoft are slugging it
out for corporate accounts in the lucrative server-software
business, and none of them wants to lose a customer to a security
threat _ no matter how obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Meredith, Netscape's senior vice president of customer
satisfaction, said the Mountain View company has notified all of
its major customers about the potential attack. She added that
Netscape's Communicator and other Web browsers are not affected by
the ``Million Question Attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said security software patches on Netscape servers
already have been tested successfully and deployed on its Netcenter
Web site, as well as on Internet sites for customers Charles Schwab
and Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and RSA officials had no comment.

AS TRADITIONAL INDUSTRIES FADE, NEW ENGLAND SEEKS IDENTITY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New England is hot.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is a booming industry, and President Bill Clinton and
his family are returning to Martha's Vineyard for another summer
vacation. Several recent polls indicate that Massachusetts
residents and those of the other five states feel good about
themselves (well maybe not the Rhode Islanders, who were the most
pessimistic in a recent Roper poll) and the region.
</P>
<P>
   Yankee magazine, the publication that celebrates New England,
has a circulation that has risen through the years and now rests
comfortably at 700,000, with 62 percent of that heading out of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   But for the tourists who come here, as well as for those who
live here, much of what we traditionally identify with New England
has faded. And much of what remains is preserved in boutique
industries and museum exhibits. Fishing, farming, and textiles,
lifestyles of a region that produced Herman Melville, Robert Frost
and Jack Kerouac, have all declined.
</P>
<P>
   Want to see a textile mill? Go to a museum in Lowell. If Clinton
watches the sunset at Menemsha as vacationers do on a clear evening
on the Vineyard, he will peer across a harbor once filled with
working fishing boats, but now jammed with pleasure yachts from all
along the East Coast. And many farms across the region are growing
subdivisions, or turning to niche produce.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are moments in history when you can tell the former
values and culture of a society are leaving you, when the amount of
nostalgia begins to build up, along with the legends and stories
about the Good Old Days,'' says American historian Thomas H.
O'Connor, the Boston College professor and author of several books
on Boston and New England.
</P>
<P>
   ``I teach a course on the age of Jackson, and that was a period
in New England where old New England _ of churchyards, town greens,
cemeteries and town meetings _ was leaving and the new New England
_ of textiles, machinery and mill girls _ was coming in. It was at
that point where New England writers, Longfellow, Emerson, Thoreau
and Hawthorne created the folklore and legends of New England,
recreating the old New England at the very moment it was becoming
the new New England. And something like that is happening now _ a
longing for the '20s, '30s and '40s, when textiles, maritimes and
the port of Boston were big.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as the city debates the future of its waterfront, it is
clear that whatever the future of the harbor is, most of it will be
far removed from its maritime past. At one recent conference on the
harbor, an MIT economist suggested that actors be hired to dress up
as longshoremen and fishermen for tourists to look at, as hotels
and office towers sprout up around the warfs.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Fish Pier, which was so busy 60 years ago that police
were required to direct pushcart traffic on the warf, is now
anchored by the Exchange Conference Center, a $7 million
Massachusetts Port Authority makeover of the building where fish
auctions once ruled. Now, the building is designed to showcase the
city to prospective businesses and can be leased for corporate
functions. Massachusetts products for the Millennium, such as
computers and razors, are displayed under glass cases inside.
</P>
<P>
   While the pier still smells of fish and the fish-processing
industry is doing well, 90 percent of the money it generates comes
from fish caught elsewhere _ flown in from around the world or
trucked in from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Tied up at one end of the pier is the Captain Sam. The 75-foot
fishing boat, built in 1979, is for sale. The windows of the
wheelhouse are covered with signs that notify anyone interested in
buying the boat that ``this vessel has sold its rights and permits
to fish to the US Government under the Department of Commerce's Buy
Back program.'' A potential owner can use the boat only for
``research, education, training, humanitarian, safety or law
enforcement purposes.'' Fishing is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Fishing will get a memorial nod at the 21st century gateway to
New England _ Logan International Airport. The airport is
undergoing a $1 billion renovation, but the new structures will
have little inside or out to let travelers know they are in New
England instead of Atlanta or Denver. One exception will be the new
parking garage. Instead of numbers or colors designating each
floor, the garage will use old New England icons. One will be the
statue of the Gloucester fisherman. (The others will be the USS
Constitution, the Boston Marathon, and the Swan Boats.) They could
have added a tractor plowing a field by a stone wall.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, Massachusetts has lost 100,000 acres of
farmland, and now only 10 percent of the land in the state is used
for agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Chileans pay a buck an hour to pick apples, you can get
an apple air-freighted into Logan &UR;  &LR; (International Airport) at the
cost to grow it in New England,'' says Jay Healy, commissioner of
the Massachusetts Department of Food and Agriculture. As a result,
New England farmers are trying to add value to their produce by
turning apples into pies, milk into blue cheese, and tomatoes into
salsa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wrestle with this every day,'' says Healy. ``We want to
help the agriculture businesses stay in production and not sell out
to the highest bidder for development.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmland, says Healy, is important psychologically as well as
economically. If they all disappear and ``we turn into New Jersey
we will miss the boat on things that make us unusual and make us
want to visit and live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite efforts to make farms more productive and give more
value to the food they produce, the largest cash crop in the state
is nursery products. Some of those trees and shrubs were purchased
to landscape the former farmland that is now subdivisions and
condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   New England towns that were not built along harbors, for
transport and fishing, were built around mills, for transport and
manufacturing.

 CHRON - STREET SMARTS   AOL CHIEF STEVE CASE WON'T BE BANNED FROM TCI-AT&AMP;T PARTY c.1998 
 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
What exactly is Steve Case trying to tell us?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buried amid the mountains of coverage on the blockbuster AT&AMP;T
Corp. buyout of Tele-Communications Inc. was an intriguing response
to the deal from the America Online chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look forward to entering into a broadband reseller
agreement with AT&AMP;T once the merger with TCI is complete,'' said
Case in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Translation: AOL has no intention of being held hostage to
narrowband phone lines while the fatband cable guys get their acts
together. Broad bandwidth can improve the speed and performance of
online services, plus cable television offers the potential for
millions of new AOL subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tries to paint these things like they're Deathwatch
2000, where there is only one winner. But I don't think that AOL is
going to get shut out of the (cable) game,'' says financial analyst
Paul Noglows of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Case still wants to join the party. And while not invited
to this week's soiree, AOL already has been dancing with AT&AMP;T and
apparently would like to go for another whirl with the bigger,
badder AT&AMP;T/TCI.
</P>
<P>
   Why it was just last week (how time flies when suits are racking
up advisory fees) that the Financial Times in London reported that
AOL rebuffed a takeover bid by AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Neither firm dignified such reports with on-the-record comments,
natch. But where there's smoke, there's often fire, and more than a
couple of analysts and money-runners think that AOL had been trying
to hammer out some sort of deal with AT&AMP;T. Albeit, it might not
have been a full-on buyout or even the purchase of a minority
stake.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, some analysts and investors speculate that AOL of
Dulles, Va., and AT&AMP;T of New York had been trying to hatch a
partnership agreement in anticipation of an AT&AMP;T-TCI merger.
</P>
<P>
   One reason AT&AMP;T may have cooled on this idea is that AT&AMP;T, while
knee-deep in talks with TCI, grew concerned about possible
antitrust challenges to its marriage with TCI.
</P>
<P>
   Why? TCI owns a 42 percent stake in At Home, an Internet portal
company that connects televisions to the Web using cable television
networks.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the market loved the proposed AT&AMP;T/TCI deal when it
came to At Home. The stock market darling's shares soared about $12
to close around $51 on the merger news Wednesday. But sentiment has
shifted swiftly. At Home shares plunged about $3.50 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   And that price drop may be an early warning sign for At Home
shareholders. Because if they listen closely to what AOL's Case is
saying, At Home is going to have to share its pole position as the
primary gateway to Web users via cable.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the AT&AMP;T/TCI announcement, At Home was the master of
its universe. TCI boasts 10.5 million cable television subscribers
and At Home was pegged to be its cable customers' primary portal to
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But that won't be the case if AOL and other content-driven
Internet services gain access to the wide, wide world of couch
potatoes with their cable boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime an Internet-based business gets into a cable-based
business, it definitely perks up the ears of the folks of At
Home,'' says Internet consultant Grady Hall of I.spy in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, AOL shareholders had reason to cheer yesterday. AOL
closed up more than $4 to around $108. While some investors may
have picked up on the pragmatic statements by Case, the shares were
also boosted by yet another Wall Street bull hanging out a ``buy''
sign on AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Financial analyst Dawn Simon of Brown Brothers Harriman in New
York initiated coverage on AOL yesterday, forecasting that the
stock could rise as high as $123 a share over the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Simon says that she didn't base her optimistic assessment on
AOL's future partners, but on the strength of the company's many
diversified revenue streams, ranging from subscription fees to
advertising to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider all of the (price run-up based on) merger and
takeover speculation as gravy,'' Simon says.
</P>
<P>
   If so, AOL's Case may be telling shareholders to get a hold of
one whale of a gravy boat before it's all over.

 B1   Net Firms Fixing 
Achilles' Heel 
In Software 
 ,14p10  By Jon Swartz 
   Chronicle Staff Writer 
   A group of Internet companies led by Netscape Communications,
Microsoft and RSA Data Security are expected today to announce
software programs to correct a potentially dangerous flaw in their
computer products.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a pre-emptive strike, the companies are posting free
``software fixes'' on their Web sites so that corporate users of
their server-software products are immune from the so-called
Million Question Attack.
</P>
<P>
   The server products contain cracks in their design that
conceivably make them susceptible to complex attacks from crafty
hackers. A successful break-in would make encrypted, or specially
coded, software on computer systems vulnerable to theft.
</P>
<P>
   A Bell Labs researcher discovered the security threat, which the
firm immediately deemed ``theoretical'' with no evidence of
reported virus attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Cryptographer Daniel Bleichenbacher said it would be nearly
impossible to exploit the security flaw. He said a successful
hacker attack would have to send up to 1 million messages to a
targeted Web server over several days to crack a computer system.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Netscape and others say they are taking the
cyberthreat seriously. Netscape, IBM and Microsoft are slugging it
out for corporate accounts in the lucrative server-software
business, and none of them wants to lose a customer to a security
threat _ no matter how obscure.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Meredith, Netscape's senior vice president of customer
satisfaction, said the Mountain View company has notified all of
its major customers about the potential attack. She added that
Netscape's Communicator and other Web browsers are not affected by
the ``Million Question Attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Meredith said security software patches on Netscape servers
already have been tested successfully and deployed on its Netcenter
Web site, as well as on Internet sites for customers Charles Schwab
and Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and RSA officials had no comment.

DISPUTES EXPECTED AT BELFAST ASSEMBLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST _ When the new Northern Ireland Assembly holds its
inaugural meeting on Wednesday in the same room where the agreement
that created it was reached, the fights will begin immediately.
</P>
<P>
   There will be arguments over where the Assembly should sit
permanently, over whether the selection of Cabinet ministers should
be held now or put off until the fall.
</P>
<P>
   But in a place where disputes are traditionally settled by
violence, the prospect of people attacking each other armed only
with their words and their mandates is considered remarkable
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, after all the votes were counted _ and under the
complicated proportional representation system it took two days _
the prospects for the Assembly appeared good, despite what is
expected to be a raucous beginning.
</P>
<P>
   About three-quarters of the 108 members of the Assembly
supported the Good Friday agreement, but it is the presence of
about 30 others who vehemently oppose it that will make Northern
Ireland's experiment with democracy a contentious affair.
</P>
<P>
   Things were looking much better for the Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble, who fended off a mutiny as he led a badly divided
Protestant community to the Assembly. Trimble's party ended up with
the most seats, at 28, which virtually ensures his election
Wednesday as the first minister of the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trimble has passed all the big tests,'' said Finnoula
O'Connor, a political analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Democratic and Labor Party, which represents moderate
Catholics, took 24 seats and became the first nationalist party to
win the most votes in a Northern Ireland election, capturing 22
percent of the first-preference votes.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Unionists, led by Trimble's nemesis, the Rev. Ian
Paisley, made a strong showing with 20 seats, and will lead the
opposition within the new Assembly. But other dissident unionists
did not capture enough seats to obstruct the workings of the
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Sydney Elliott, a political scientist at Queen's University,
said the election results showed that more unionists voted for
candidates opposed to the agreement, but that the overall vote for
pro-agreement candidates rose from 71 percent in last month's
referendum to about 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout in the referendum was a record 81 percent, but only 69
percent on Thursday, when the election was held. Turnout among
Catholic nationalists, however, did not drop, something analysts
attribute to nationalist confidence and unionist angst. While
unionists are divided over the Assembly and the agreement,
nationalists see both as favorable to their cause.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, the party that is close to the Irish Republican Army,
improved its vote for the third consecutive election, taking 18
seats, one more than it expected. Sinn Fein's electoral success is
crucial to reassuring the IRA that it was wise to let politics take
precedence in their campaign for a united Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Unionists will use their new bully pulpit in the Assembly to
demand that the IRA say the war is over and begin turning in some
of its weapons, a subject that will be raised regularly.
</P>
<P>
   The middle-of-the-road Alliance Party, which attracts voters
from across the sectarian divide, took six seats. Alliance members
could emerge as the swing votes in an Assembly that is likely to be
frequently divided along lines of religion and national identity.
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Coalition, which has only been in existence for two
years, took two seats, including one for the party leader, Monica
McWilliams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good day for democracy,'' said McWilliams, whose party
was credited with bringing a good deal of civility and common sense
to the negotiations that led to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Scenes Saturday suggested new possibilities in politics. When
Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams learned that Billy Hutchinson, a
convicted loyalist killer, had won a second seat for the
Progressive Unionist Party, he burst out, ``Well done, Billy!'' at
the City Hall counting center.
</P>
<P>
   Adams and other republicans were at war with loyalists like
Hutchinson for nearly 30 years, but now Sinn Fein and the
Progressive Unionists are among those most anxious for the Assembly
to work.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Kelly, a former IRA bomber, won a Sinn Fein seat in the
same North Belfast constituency as Hutchinson. Kelly said that
while the two would never agree on the question of whether Northern
Ireland should remain part of Britain or be united with the Irish
Republic, they share common views on economic and social policy.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly is likely to make strange political bedfellows. One
who won't be getting into bed with anyone, however, is Paisley. He
has vowed to prevent the creation of cross-border authorities that
will oversee areas of mutual interest on the island, such as
agriculture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   But those authorities are a crucial element in the Good Friday
accord, which says that the Assembly will be suspended if there is
not agreement by Oct. 31 on establishing the cross-border bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Paisley says they are part of an eventual slide into a united
Ireland. Mainstream unionists don't like them, but are prepared to
put up with them in exchange for the Assembly and nationalists
accepting that Northern Ireland will remain part of the United
Kingdom until a majority living there want otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another sign of the changed times, Adams and other
leading republicans said they regretted that Gary McMichael, leader
of the Ulster Democratic Party, did not win a seat in the Assembly.
McMichael's party is the political wing of the Ulster Defense
Association, a loyalist paramilitary group that has killed hundreds
of Catholics, including Sinn Fein officials.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, the IRA killed McMichael's father, John, who
wanted to take the Defense Association into the political arena.
Now, former killers from both sides of the divide here are heading
into a new political arena.

`ROUTINELY' COVERED BY INSURANCE? NOT ALWAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JUDY FOREMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hanna Gremp, a 6-year-old from Modesto, Calif., is a gorgeous
child. Big brown eyes. Long blond hair. Button nose.
</P>
<P>
   But she was born with incomplete &UR;  &LR; outer ears. She could hear
with a hearing aid, but her ears looked deformed. She was an
obvious candidate, it would seem, for reconstructive surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Gremps' insurer paid for surgery to begin reconstructing her
ears when Hanna was five. But it can take several operations to
reconstruct deformed body parts, and after the first, the insurer
left the state.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the night before Hanna was to have a second
operation, the Gremps found out their new insurer had denied
coverage, arguing the surgery was cosmetic. Only after their
attorney fired off a letter &UR;  &LR; to the insurer, Hanna's mother Luann
says, did the company agree to pay for the next surgery _ but not
until next month.
</P>
<P>
   The family had wanted it done ``by the time she started first
grade,'' her mom says. ``She'll miss a lot of first grade now.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hatfield, a charming 19-year-old from Houston, now a
sophomore at Emory University, tells an equally harrowing tale of
having to fight for surgery that was once routinely covered.
</P>
<P>
   Born with eyes too far apart and insufficient bone structure in
his face, he had three operations to move his eyes closer and
provide more support for his nose, with a bone from his rib. But
last year, his insurer balked at the final planned surgery,
claiming that constructing eye sockets and cheekbones was ``not
necessary to correct a functional disorder.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurer caved in only after the Hatfields went public with
their fight. The fact Mike could function with a deformed face was
not the issue, his mother says: ``Every single person deserves
cheekbones and the eye sockets everybody else has.''
</P>
<P>
   The battle for coverage for children's reconstructive surgery is
gathering steam on the West Coast and moving East fast.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in Washington last week , the American Society of
Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons kicked off a campaign to
highlight what the surgeons say is an alarming tendency for health
insurers to deny claims for reconstructive surgery, including for
kids with birth defects like cleft lip and cleft palate, problems
they have historically paid for.
</P>
<P>
   Two to 3 percent of all kids are born with structural defects,
says Dr. Edward Lammer, director of the craniofacial anomalies
center at Children's Hospital in Oakland. And one in every 700 is
born with a cleft lip and palate, in which the upper lip and roof
of the mouth fail to fuse. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Hard data on the number of denied claims for reconstructive
surgery don't exist, but 13 states have become concerned enough to
pass laws addressing the issue.
</P>
<P>
   When the surgeons' group recently surveyed its members, more
than half the respondents said that in the last two years, they'd
had pediatric patients who'd either been denied coverage or had
encountered long delays in getting surgery coverage approved for
craniofacial or other congenital anomalies.
</P>
<P>
   And they're not talking cosmetic surgery here, which the
American Medical Association defines as surgery to reshape normal
body structures to improve appearance and self-esteem. They're
talking reconstruction _ surgery performed on abnormal body
structures caused by congenital defects, developmental
abnormalities, trauma, infection, tumors or disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a total disgrace for the insurance industry. How can they
in good faith and conscience sleep at night _ to say a child born
without an ear doesn't need an ear?'' fumes Dr. Henry Kawamoto, a
plastic surgeon in Santa Monica, Calif. Denial of claims is ``an
epidemic,'' he says. ``It was not a problem in California until
about five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, health insurers take a different view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've heard this before, this charge. But we've not seen any
substantiation,'' says Don White, spokesman for the American
Association of Health Plans, the trade group for HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Coorsh, spokesman for the Health Insurance Association
of America, the trade association for many other insurers, says,
``We don't collect information on this.''
</P>
<P>
   But surgeons say the problem is real, and, like other trends in
health care economics, it's working its way east from California.
</P>
<P>
   It's become ``really rampant in the last year,'' says Dr. John
Persing, chief of plastic surgery at Yale University School of
Medicine. ``Prior to that, it was never really disputed that a
child with a cleft lip and nasal deformity was benefitted by steps
to try to bring a child to a more normal appearance...The kids wind
up getting really stressed out.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the denial of claims in Boston does not appear to be
widespread, say Dr. Michael Lewis, chief of plastic surgery at New
England Medical Center, and Dr. John Mulliken , director of the
craniofacial center at Children's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   But it happens. One of Lewis' patients, a 6-year-old girl whose
ears are very large and whose neck is ``webbed'' (meaning abnormal
tissue grows from the ears to the shoulders) was recently denied
coverage for plastic surgery because her insurer decided the
operation was cosmetic. Her mother vows to keep fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty obvious visual deformity that sets her aside
from the average child,'' says Lewis. ``I have not had trouble in
the past getting this approved.''
</P>
<P>
   And while cynics might wonder whether the surgeons' concern is
sparked by worry about their own incomes, they say it's not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not fighting for these kids because we're making large
fees. We'd be financially much better off doing cosmetic surgery,''
says Mulliken of Children's.
</P>
<P>
   On average, he says, repairing a cleft lip takes four hours, and
the surgeon's fee is $900. Cosmetic surgery on the upper and lower
eyelids takes two hours, and the surgeon gets $4,000, paid by the
patient. A 3-hour facelift gets the surgeon $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Dentistry and orthodontics, traditionally excluded from health
care plans anyway, are a particular problem for kids with facial
defects, adds Dr. Stephen Shusterman, dentist-in-chief at
Children's Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstructing the bite or the teeth of a child with a cleft
palate is ``obviously very necessary,'' he says. But insurers
``usually reject it on the grounds that it's dentistry,''
</P>
<P>
   leaving parents with dental bills of $10,000 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   So what should you do if you're told that surgery to correct a
serious deformity in your child is not medically necessary?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't give up,'' says Lammer of Oakland. ``The squeaky wheel
is necessary to make the system work properly...it's all about
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hatfield agrees, adding that while he was confident and
happy before his final surgery a year ago, his life now is
``completely changed. Now I have the exact same opportunity that
other kids going off to college have. It's all about first
impressions in this country.''

NO, EVERYBODY DOESN'T KNOW THAT
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that,'' I heard the woman say when the train
pulled to a stop. Her tone was dismissive. Her manner distracted.
She went back to her magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting next to her was a girl of about 7 or 8 whose face seemed
to reflect a variety of emotions. Disappointment. Anger.
Bewilderment. Or maybe I was projecting my own feelings onto the
child.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what she'd said to the woman, who may have been her
mother, but it didn't deserve that response.
</P>
<P>
   I wanted to cross the aisle and tell the girl I had no idea what
she'd said, but that whatever it was, I was sure that everybody
doesn't know it, and that even if they do, it doesn't matter. All
that matters is that she knows it, and that she wants to share it
with someone else. That's what's important. She shouldn't let the
woman's careless remark hurt her.
</P>
<P>
   Of course I didn't speak to the child for fear she and the woman
would think I was a nut. And maybe I am, because I get nutty when I
hear somebody say that, especially when they say it to a child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody goes through that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels the same way when they're your age.''
</P>
<P>
   I've heard these and similar things said so many times, and so,
I imagine, have you. I've probably said them myself, although I try
very hard not to. Usually these phrases are just blather, the kind
of thing people say without thinking. Have a nice day. Be good.
How's it going?
</P>
<P>
   But these thoughtless remarks can hurt. Because when somebody
says, ``Everybody thinks that,'' what they're really saying is, ``I
can't be bothered to listen to you,'' or ``You don't know
anything,'' or ``You're no different than anybody else. Your
thoughts, your feelings, your experiences aren't unique. I don't
want to hear about them. So shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   I hear those words and I'm back in the eighth grade, in English
class, and the teacher has acknowledged my raised hand and I am
standing up, because in those days, in that school, you always
stood up to speak. I don't remember what I said, nothing very
brilliant I'm sure. But I remember what she said, ``Everybody knows
that.''
</P>
<P>
   I sat down. I sat down for the rest of the year. I never raised
my hand again. I never volunteered to speak. I waited until I was
called upon. At a parent-teacher conference the same teacher told
my mother, ``I'm afraid your daughter isn't college material.''
</P>
<P>
   My mother was devastated. And furious. At me. At the teacher. At
the school. At life, because her kid had suddenly turned into a
knucklehead. I was fascinated by the phrase ``college material,''
which unfortunately for me became part of our daily vocabulary at
home. I imagined some sort of fine, silky fabric from which
intelligent people were cut, while the rest of us were made of
burlap.
</P>
<P>
   The next year I was lucky, and drew a wonderful English teacher.
Things improved. But I never forgot that eighth grade teacher. And
I never forgot what she said to me. ``Everybody knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought of her again the other day, when I saw one of those
billboards advertising Macintosh computers, a big picture of Jim
Henson, with Kermit the Frog, and the words, ``Think different.''
My eighth grade teacher wouldn't have gotten the point. She would
have corrected the grammar.

DON'T UNDERESTIMATE `RIDICULOUS' 401(K) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We would like to retire in 10 to 12 years. I have absolutely
no money saved. My company offers a ridiculous 401(k), matching no
portion of contributions. My husband contributes approximately $400
to $500 a week to a company stock savings plan and 401(k). We are
37 and 41 years old and have little or no knowledge of investing.
Where should we start?
</P>
<P>
   M.C., San Diego &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I suggest you start by rethinking your company's
``ridiculous'' 401(k) program. A 401(k) has considerable value even
if the company doesn't match contributions or offer any other
incentives. One virtue is that it makes it very easy for people who
are not in the saving habit to save _ once you sign up, the funds
are automatically deducted from your paycheck and are accordingly
sheltered from the myriad attractive nuisances that American
marketers dream up. A more substantial advantage of a 401(k) is
that it provides deferral of taxes on both the money contributed
and the earnings it generates. The thinking is that in retirement
most people will be in a lower tax bracket than they are during
their earning years, and accordingly they will save by paying the
taxes later at a lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem for you is that funds in a 401(k) are difficult
or expensive to get at before age 59 1/2. If you simply withdraw
money before that age, you face a 10 percent premature withdrawal
penalty, as well as the tax. (It is also possible to withdraw funds
before that age through a sequence of equal payments designed to
last through your life expectancy, but once you embark on such a
plan you are locked into it until age 59 1/2, and accordingly you
lose a lot of flexibility in your financial planning.)
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion for a person in your situation is to use the
401(k), but not for all your savings. You might decide to put half
of your retirement savings in the 401(k) and keep the remainder,
which you will mentally earmark for those years before you reach
age 59 1/2, in a taxable mutual fund account. Most of the major
fund families _ Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, and so forth _ offer
excellent information packets describing mutual funds in general,
how to select funds to meet your objective, and their offerings in
particular. If you simply get 800 numbers for the funds from
information, they will be happy to fill your mailbox to overflowing
with their literature. If you want to get a more fundamental primer
on investing, the investment equivalent to Doctor Spock's baby book
is How To Buy Stocks, by Louis Engel and Brendan Boyd, continuously
in print for 55 years and currently available in mass market
paperback.
</P>
<P>
   To a certain extent your fund choices will probably be dictated
by the menu of investments available through your 401(k) plan. For
example, if your plan offers a solid growth and income offering
such as a fund tracking the Standard and Poor's 500 Index, you
might select that as your core position, diversifying the 401(k)
program by adding a balanced fund and maybe, since your anticipated
time frame isn't all that long, even a small position in a bond
fund. But many 401(k) menus have limited offerings among small-cap
or sector funds, and you can accordingly hone in on those with your
taxable positions.

   Q. My daughter will start college this fall at a private school
that costs $15,000 in addition to a scholarship she received. Among
our assets is $42,000 in mutual funds and stocks in custodial
accounts for her. She has been offered a 2 percent loan that would
cover her entire education with no principal payment for 10 years.
I believe the money is better left in those accounts, to be used
for eventual repayment of the loans. What do you think of that
idea?
</P>
<P>
   M.M., Beaumont, Texas
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds like a great idea to me _ so great, in fact, that
it seems likely there's something wrong with it. On most
application for financial aid for college, parents and students are
required to list their income and assets separately. This is
because they are treated very differently. In the basic formula,
students are expected to commit 50 percent of their income and 35
percent of their assets to educational costs; parents are expected
to be willing to commit 47 percent of their income, but only 5.65
percent of their assets. Now even though you or your wife are
custodians of that $42,000, it belongs to your daughter, and it
should be listed as her asset.
</P>
<P>
   Under the typical formula for student aid, the assumption would
then be that she should be willing to spend $14,700 of it for her
first year of college, and thus be eligible for only $300 in loans
for the first year. In later years, her presumed contribution would
decrease as her assets are consumed, and loan eligibility would
increase accordingly. Following the numbers through (and assuming a
6 percent return from her investments), after four full years she
would have spent all but $9,218 of that $42,000, and have borrowed
a total of $23,387.
</P>
<P>
   My suspicion is that the custodial accounts were listed on the
wrong place, and that was why your daughter was offered this very
attractive loan program. If I'm wrong, of course you're right _
it's a terrific deal, and your daughter would not only be able to
pay the interest during the first ten years and then repay the
principal, but also would have about $30,000 left over. But
remember the old investment rule _ if it sounds too good to be
true, it likely is.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 26 and work for a mutual fund company. I have a balance
of $10,500 in my 401(k) plan, of which 30 percent is in company
stock, 30 percent in Evergreen fund, 25 percent in a Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index fund, and 15 percent in Evergreen Balanced fund.
My company matches 100 percent of the first 6 percent of salary I
contribute, and I add a further 3 percent. Two additional options
have recently been added to your 401(k) menu _ Evergreen
International Growth and Mentor Growth. I plan to retire around age
65, and want to know what allocation would work best to maximize
returns. I do not wish to reallocate the existing money, but would
rather like to change the selection of funds for new money. How
would you position this portfolio among these six options?
</P>
<P>
   A.D., Boston &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This is a little difficult, because a balanced fund has no
place in a portfolio that has 39 years to grow. If you insist on
keeping Evergreen Balanced _ which is a solid enough fund _ I
suggest you stop contributing to that account for ... oh, make it
about 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   But I would much rather see you move out entirely, into a more
growth-oriented portfolio. Allocation might run along these lines:
30 percent company stock, 25 percent in the index offering, and 15
percent each in the mid-cap growth fund (Evergreen fund), the
international offering (Evergreen International Growth), and the
small-cap growth fund (Mentor).
</P>
<P>
   If you are unwilling to make any transfers, you'll have to
juggle your allocations of new money to reach those levels. Thus,
you might begin by dividing all new money to Evergreen
International Growth and Mentor funds until each account is 15
percent of the total portfolio, and then dividing contributions
evenly among company stock, the index fund, the international fund,
and the small-cap fund.
</P>
<P>
   Continue this until you have brought the Evergreen position down
to 25 percent. At that point, you can allocate money among the
various funds according to the target positions, rebalancing
annually. As for the balanced fund position, I would leave it out
of the calculations.

IN ALABAMA RUNOFF, A FERVOR OVER RELIGION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CURTIS WILKIE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ As Governor Fob James and his challenger,
Winton Blount, tumble toward Tuesday's runoff election, they sound
as though they are running for deacon rather than Alabama's
Republican gubernatorial nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In their final debate Thursday night, James mused about America
as ``a Christian nation'' while Blount, embracing the principle of
forgiveness, assured a statewide television audience that he still
considered the governor ``a good Christian'' even though he had
earlier accused James of lying and cheating in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least they are not talking about race,'' said Bradley
Moody, a professor of political science at Auburn University in
Montgomery, referring to the theme that has poisoned state politics
since the days when George C. Wallace ruled Alabama 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   James has been mixing church and state since he threatened to
call out the National Guard last year to defend a county judge's
display of the Ten Commandments on a wooden tablet in his
courtroom. He then defied a federal judge by arguing that the Bill
of Rights did not apply to an Alabama law authorizing voluntary
prayer in schools. James likes to say that ``God has been
blackballed'' by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Blount is running radio spots quoting the
Bible and declaring that only ministers have a higher calling than
public servants. If elected, Blount promises to serve with
``reverence'' and ``devotion.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a bizarre campaign, rooted in an incident several years
ago when James displayed his contempt for the theory of evolution
by emulating an ape, waddling across a meeting room of the Alabama
Board of Education. When Blount recalled James's performance this
month and criticized the governor for ``dancing around like a
monkey,'' James retorted: ``Well, I'm a monkey that's in good
shape. I'm not a fat monkey.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's wife, Bobbie James, who is said to have banished
portraits of Robert E. Lee and former first ladies from the
governor's mansion because she felt they were possessed by demons,
joined the fray by calling Blount ``a big, fat sissy.'' She later
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   A star running back for Auburn in the 1950s, the 63-year-old
James has grown rumpled and overweight since he made a fortune
manufacturing plastic barbells and went into politics. Blount, 54,
is a Montgomery businessman whose prosperity rivals his girth. His
father, one of Alabama's earliest Republicans, served as postmaster
general in the Nixon administration.
</P>
<P>
   Their contest is nip-and-tuck. In the first primary on June 2,
James won 48 percent of the vote while Blount, who ran
unsuccessfully for governor four years ago, took 41 percent. Three
other Republican also-rans, whose total vote denied James a
majority, endorsed Blount following the first primary.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of Tuesday's runoff will face Lieutenant Governor Don
Siegelman, a Democrat, in the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
   But in a bid to knock off the conservative incumbent on Tuesday,
Richard Arrington, the black mayor of Birmingham, has promised to
deliver thousands of black votes for Blount in the Republican
showdown. Crossover voting is permitted in Alabama, which has no
formal party registration.
</P>
<P>
   Giles Perkins, executive director of the state Democratic Party,
said the party is discouraging Democrats from taking part in the
GOP race, and political analysts predict that few blacks will
actually take a Republican ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Moody describes Tuesday's election as a battle between the
governor, a champion of the white working class, and a challenger
who represents the interests of the ``chamber of commerce, country
club Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   In his campaign, Blount has charged that Alabama lags behind
other Southeastern states because of James's lack of vision and
personal eccentricities. He has also said that a landfill owned by
James's family has reaped unseemly profits from state business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people might agree that James is crazy and does
unconventional things,'' said Moody, ``but they don't think he's
dishonest.''
</P>
<P>
   However, James's opponents say the governor is hypocritical.
When James recently signed a bill requiring silent meditation by
schoolchildren, he was heard muttering curses over an open
television microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Editorial writers in Alabama are scornful of the governor. The
Birmingham News pronounced James an ``embarrassment.'' A columnist
for the Montgomery Advertiser, Bob Ingram, wrote that James's ``fat
monkey'' remark ``was another example of Fob putting his foot in
his mouth, which he has done so often his face may soon have
stretch marks.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandt Ayers, editor and publisher of the Anniston Star, said
James has failed to maximize the state's potential during a period
when other states in the region are thriving economically. ``He's
involved in all these crazy crusades,'' Ayers said. ``He's devoted
so much energy to defend the Ten Commandements you'd think somebody
was out to repeal them.''
</P>
<P>
   Howell Raines, an Alabama native and editor of The New York
Times editorial page, said this month that James is the latest in a
long line of embarrassing Alabama governors, running from Kissin'
Jim Folsom's public drunkenness to Wallace's tolerance of ``racial
violence and a culture of endemic corruption in Montgomery'' to the
``hayseed machinations'' of Guy Hunt, who was drummed out of office
following a conviction for state ethics violations in 1993.
Alabama's lack of progress, Raines wrote, ``can be linked directly
to its penchant for electing buffoons.''
</P>
<P>
   In the face of criticism, James used a state plane this past
week to fly to Dallas to address several hundred followers of the
Christ for the Nations Institute, an evangelical mission. He told
the crowd he would join an organized resistance to the federal
government if marshals are sent to DeKalb County, Alabama, to
enforce a court order against practicing religion in public
schools. ``The people in DeKalb County are brave people, and they
will resist, and I will support them,'' James vowed.
</P>
<P>
   During their debate the next night in Birmingham, Blount said
James had exploited the issue of religious freedom and ``terribly
confused the people of this state.''

COLE RETURNS TO TANGLEWOOD IN A SIGNATURE ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vinson Cole was a promising young American singer when he made
his Tanglewood debut as Jacquino in Beethoven's ``Fidelio'' in
1982. This week the tenor returns to Tanglewood to open the season
in one of the signature roles of his distinguished career, Faust in
Berlioz's ``La Damnation de Faust.'' It's a part he has sung more
than 70 times and to the satisfaction of some of the world's most
eminent conductors, including Seiji Ozawa, with whom he has taken
the role part in performances with the Berlin Philharmonic and the
New Japan Philharmonic. Friday night's performance will be Cole's
first with the Boston Symphony Orchestra; he will be singing
opposite the celebrated Marguerite of Frederica von Stade.
</P>
<P>
   Cole also is probably the ranking African-American male opera
singer. Since Leontyne Price, many African-American women have been
prominent presences on the world operatic stage, but men have had a
harder time of it. George Shirley was Cole's only predecessor in
leading tenor roles in major international contexts. At 47 and at
the peak of his career, Cole is in a comparably lonely position
today, with no successor in sight. ``Race seems to be less of an
issue in Europe,'' Cole says. ``I've had a larger operatic career
in Europe than in the United States, but what that's due to, I
really can't say. I basically go where I am wanted _ why would I go
someplace where I wasn't wanted?''
</P>
<P>
   For a singer of his stature, Cole has appeared infrequently at
the Metropolitan Opera. Whatever the reasons for that, it's not
because the Met has a roster full of tenors who sing better than
Cole. This is not a subject Cole wants to get into, although he
says he enjoyed singing some outdoor performances of ``Carmen''
with the Met in the parks recently, and a tour of ``La Damnation de
Faust'' with the Met orchestra under the direction of James Levine.
</P>
<P>
   Cole grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and he's been singing most of
his life. ``I sang in church choirs ever since I can remember, and
when I was 9, a woman heard me and took me to her voice teacher at
the Kansas City Conservatory. I started taking lessons, and at 10 I
sang in my first opera _ I was Amahl in `Amahl and the Night
Visitors.''' Before long, Cole was singing for every organization
in Kansas City, including the Lyric Opera, where he sang in ``La
Boheme,'' ``Tosca,'' and ``Rigoletto.''
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Cole's voice changed. ``It was a late drop, and it
happened overnight. My first voice teacher always said, `When your
voice changes, do not stop singing, but continue to work,' so
that's what I did. It was his belief that many tenors became
baritones because they stopped singing when their voices changed
and waited for them to settle. But if you're using the voice, the
possibility of singing as a tenor is there. I have reason to thank
him for that advice.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole attended the University of Missouri and then went on to
Philadelphia. At the Philadelphia Music Academy he worked with the
great Met star of the 1940s, Licia Albanese (``a lovely lady'');
the next year, at the Curtis Institute of Music, he began working
with another Met veteran, Margaret Harshaw, with whom Cole studied
right up until her death at age 88 earlier this year. ``We were
extremely close. The day before she died, she said to her son,
`Tell Vinson when he goes down to the low voice ...' I said to him,
`She's going to go to her grave working on my voice,' and that's
exactly what she did. She spoke her mind totally, but that's what
you want from a teacher. I can't tell you how grateful I am to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Cole spent two summers as an apprentice in Santa Fe, and made
his official operatic debut in the title role of Mascagni's
``L'Amico Fritz'' in the spring season of the San Francisco Opera
in 1976, appearing opposite Leona Mitchell. Cole was still a
student at Curtis at the time. The next year he won the national
auditions of the Metropolian Opera. Shirley Verrett was one of the
judges; she fumed at some colleagues who felt that Cole wasn't
singing loudly enough. ``Are we talking loud,'' Verrett said
pointedly, ``or are we talking good?''
</P>
<P>
   Cole's career was launched. He made his Boston debut singing the
Steersman in Sarah Caldwell's Opera Company of Boston production of
``The Flying Dutchman,'' and soon he found himself a regular guest
of major American orchestras.
</P>
<P>
   An underremarked aspect of Seiji Ozawa's music directorship of
the Boston Symphony Orchestra is his belief in young American
artists like Cole and his loyalty to them over the years; those
artists in turn have been remarkably loyal to him. Cole has been a
regular guest of the Boston Symphony, memorably participating in
the orchestra's Berlioz festival and tour in 1993 and in the
tribute to his great predecessor Roland Hayes in 1996. (Hayes was
the first African-American soloist to be engaged by a major
American orchestra.) ``It is always a joy to work with Seiji, which
I have done at La Scala, in Berlin, and in Japan, as well as in
Boston,'' Cole says. ``Like Herbert von Karajan, he is a wonderful
accompanist because he is a wonderful listener _ you feel you are
being carried through the piece on a pillow, so you can really
enjoy the experience. That's rare as far as conductors go. I also
love singing with the Boston Symphony; it is such a wonderful sound
it makes. I've been listening to a broadcast recording from 1955
when my teacher, Margaret Harshaw, sang Wagner's `Immolation Scene'
from `Die Gotterdammerung' with the orchestra under the direction
of Charles Munch; all the facets of the music are there, and it's
really fantastic. To sing with this orchestra means something
special to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most colleagues in the musical world, Cole adores Von
Stade. ``She's one of the nicest people in the entire world, and
she brings such a wonderful, vibrant life to whatever she does. I
recently heard her in a recital for the first time _ it was in
Munich and I was bowled over. From song to song she could change
moods in a matter of seconds; the changes were utterly natural _
there was nothing phony or showy about them. She gives of herself
and she's honest; when she sings with you, you feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   Karajan was one of Cole's major mentors. ``The patronage of
Karajan had two edges: People adored him and immediately accepted
you because Karajan had. But there were people who didn't like him,
and if you sang with him, they wanted nothing to do with you.
Nevertheless, I would not give up one second of the experience of
working with him _ these were the greatest musical experiences of
my life. It wasn't anything he actually said or told me; it was
what took place in performance and rehearsal. It was
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   With Karajan, Cole sang the Italian Singer in ``Der
Rosenkavalier,'' Beethoven's ``Missa Solemnis'' and Ninth Symphony,
the Mozart and Verdi Requiems, and the Bruckner Te Deum. ``There
were other things too that were scheduled, but he died. Florestan
in Beethoven's `Fidelio' would have been the next thing; he wanted
to get back to the old Viennese tradition of a lyric tenor like
Julius Patzak or Anton Dermota in this part, which comes out of
Gluck, Mozart, and Haydn rather than leading directly to Wagner.
Then we were going to do Stravinsky's `Oedipus Rex' and Mahler's
`Das Lied von der Erde.'''
</P>
<P>
   Most of Cole's projects with Ka-rajan were recorded, and he also
has made recordings with Vladimir Ashkenazy (Mendelssohn's
``Lobgesang''), Giuseppe Sinopli (Liszt's ``Faust'' Symphony),
Carlo Maria Giulini (Verdi Requiem), and Bernard Haitink (Bruckner
Te Deum). Next season he will record Berlioz's ``L'Enfance du
Christ'' in Leipzig. There are also some recordings Cole is not on.
</P>
<P>
   Cole makes his home in Seattle. ``I'd been in New York and
Florida a long time, but I really wanted to go somewhere where I
could have a different quality of life. I enjoy it in Seattle _ you
can go from the mountains to the water within 35 minutes, and the
fish is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction is a remarkable 10-year association with the
Seattle Opera, where Cole has sung 11 roles, including Gluck's
``Orfeo'' in a production directed by Mark Morris, Romeo, Werther,
Rodolfo, Pinkerton, Nadir, Don Jose, Ferrando, Nemorino, and Percy
in ``Anna Bolena.'' ``Over the years I've sung everything from
Monteverdi to Stravinsky, with everything in between; I feel
particularly comfortable in French roles. There isn't much I could
sing that I haven't yet, although I'm excited that I'm going to
sing Cavaradossi in `Tosca' again _ I haven't done that since I was
20 and still in college. I would also love to sing Lohengrin, in
the right theater and under the right circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The subject of a possible glass ceiling to his career is clearly
not one Cole enjoys discussing, but he does speak forthrightly
about prejudice. ``What just happened in Jasper, Texas, proves that
prejudice does still exist. These things have existed and will
exist. People are not born with prejudice, but they are taught it,
and as long as people continue to teach it, to expose little
children to it, it will continue. My job is to do what I know how
to do. If I run into problems, I try to work around them. What I
try to do is try to overcome what's there, do my job, and keep
striving to do my best, to be the best I can be. That's the only
advice I can offer anybody.''

DECIPHERING THE CRUELTY OF ARGENTINA'S REIGN OF TERROR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
A LEXICON OF TERROR 
Argentina and the Legacies of Torture 
By Marguerite Feitlowitz 
Oxford University Press, 302 pp., illustrated, $30 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Argentine president Carlos Menem has been described as a
``post-modern president,'' one who ``does not feel bound by words,
especially not his own words.''
</P>
<P>
   The description has come from analysts trying to reconcile
Menem's past promises with his policies, as he has shifted away
from populism during his nine-year presidency. But the assessment
cuts much deeper, to the core of his nation's powerful relationship
with language, which dates as far back as the Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Feitlowitz sheds new light on this relationship in
``A Lexicon of Terror,'' a chronicle of the so-called Dirty War of
the late 1970s, in which as many as 30,000 suspected leftists were
secretly ``disappeared'' by the military, many of them raped and
executed. The book is a painstaking study of the terror, a
dissection of the regime's sinister manipulation of language and
rhetoric. But it is hardly a dry or academic study.
</P>
<P>
   Through the horrifying narratives of dozens of kidnapped
survivors and their families, Feitlowitz, who teaches writing and
translation at Harvard, builds a compelling argument that the
military regime irrevocably altered the Argentine vocabulary and,
in turn, its psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Each chapter introduces prison camp survivors tortured by warped
usage of ordinary words: ``parilla,'' the traditional Argentine
meat grill, came to mean the metal table where victims were laid
out for torture; ``fish food'' was slang for corpses thrown from
military planes into the sea. Juxtaposed are the chilling official
speeches denying that there was any torture at all. Reprinted in
the book, along with clippings from newspapers that accepted the
double talk at face value, the speeches expose a tradition of an
officialdom ``not bound by words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It made you psychotic,'' says one Argentine mother who, like
hundreds, kept vigil for her lost child in the central government
square. ``We could barely `read' let alone `translate' the world
around us. And that was exactly what they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The regime rose to power in 1976, after the ousting of Isabel
Peron, whose two-year presidency following her husband's death left
Argentina in a state of mayhem. To restore order, the new military
leadership laid strict ground rules, demanding the eradication of
anyone considered ``a threat.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad interpretation of danger led to the November 1977
kidnapping of physicist Mario Villani, to whom Feitlowitz devotes
nearly 20 pages. ``Disappeared'' as he drove through downtown
Buenos Aires, Villani was spirited away to a secret torture prison
named ``the Athletic Club.'' He remained imprisoned for the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
   During more than six hours of interviews, Villani recalled the
unimaginable physical torture of lying blindfolded on the
``parilla'' while guards seared his skin with a 220-volt electric
prod. But it is the dialogue inside the prison that makes up the
bulk of his account.
</P>
<P>
   Kidnap victims were constantly told they ``did not exist.'' When
they were scheduled for torture, or ``physical therapy,'' they were
brought to an ``operating theater.'' A prisoner on his way to die
was told he was ``being given his ticket,'' a cruel phrase that
over time became used as a commonplace threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right after they disappeared me, I didn't understand a lot of
what was said to me,'' Villani said. ``And then when I got out,
people didn't understand what I said to them. I realized I was
still thinking _ and talking _ in camp terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Such interviews _ and there are dozens in the book _ are the
result of the many years the author spent in Argentina, both as a
Fulbright research scholar in 1990 and with a Mary Bunting
Fellowship in 1992-93. Almost all the interviews are recounted in
the present tense; Feitlowitz is careful to frame each survivor in
the world of the living, a forceful reminder of the legacy that
remains in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   Politics is treated similarly; the last quarter of the book is
devoted to the ``Scilingo Effect,'' the national reawakening that
began in March 1995, when retired Navy Captain Adolfo Scilingo
publicly confessed to his role in dumping ``fish food'' into the
sea.
</P>
<P>
   The book ends in 1997, with Menem's refusal to address new
revelations about the terror on the very last page. With that,
Feitlowitz underscores her point. ``The past is a predator,''
Feitlowitz says, quoting the Argentine adage. And it is one that
still requires a ``popular volition to meet the danger at its
source.''

AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE'S TOP 100 LOSES SIGHT OF HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes Top 100 list)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even more fun than looking at a list is second-guessing it.
That's what was fun about the American Film Institute's
much-bruited list of what it deemed America's 100 greatest movies.
First, however, full disclosure: This writer was one of the voters,
although not one of those who put together the list of 400 films
from which the 100 came. Further, this writer is affiliated with
the National Film Preservation Board, which helps nominate each
year's batch of 25 films added to the National Film Registry of the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   My own list, drawn up for a forthcoming anthology, remains in
constant flux. This film is dropped, that film is added, others are
reassessed. Although the AFI list contains great films, it's tilted
as much to popularity as merit, with too many great older films
crowded out by contemporary films of debatable quality. At the risk
of seeming a bad loser, griping about personal favorites that
didn't make the final cut, it seems obvious that the voting was
dominated by pleasurable recollection of films seen within the
voter's lifetime, not from any real sense of film history.
Otherwise, how does one explain the omission of the great silent
films that gave film its language and grammar?
</P>
<P>
   Only four silents were named. D.W. Griffith was represented by
``Birth of a Nation.'' It can be argued that ``Intolerance'' is
greater. What &UR;  &LR; of Erich von Stroheim's ``Greed''? Victor Seastrom's
``The Wind''? Chaplin, of course, deserves a place on any list. But
three Chaplin films _ ``The Gold Rush,'' ``City Lights,'' and
``Modern Times'' _ were named, while none by Buster Keaton was.
``The General'' was the only Keaton feature on the ballot. But it's
a big one that shouldn't have been overlooked. The silent
``Ben-Hur,'' with its assimilationist subtext conveying in veiled
fashion the story of Hollywood's moguls, is miles better than the
later and barely watchable Oscar-winning version that made the cut.
``The Big Parade'' and ``The Crowd'' stand up handsomely today,
too. So does ``Wings,'' the first Oscar winner, still remarkable
for its aviation sequences.
</P>
<P>
   The omissions are just as puzzling when sound enters the
picture. ``Footlight Parade,'' the best black-and-white musical
ever, didn't even make the preliminary list. ``42nd Street,'' the
Busby Berkeley musical that did show up on the ballot, was denied a
place on the final 100. Similarly, it's ridiculaous that the list
should contain no Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers musical, even though
``Top Hat'' was an option. What about gangster icon Jimmy Cagney?
He just made the cut, coming in at No. 100 with ``Yankee Doodle
Dandy.'' Cagney began as a dancer and was a good one, but how can a
list of American classics omit the man who made the gangster movie
what it was, from the jolting ``Public Enemy'' to my favorite, the
even wilder and surprisingly tender ``White Heat''?
</P>
<P>
   The director of ``White Heat,'' Raoul Walsh, was denied entry,
too, even though his career practically spanned the history of
movies, of which he directed a couple of hundred, including ``The
Big Trail,'' ``High Sierra,'' ``They Drive by Night,'' and ``The
Man I Love.'' William Wellman, whose career includes ``Wings'' and
``Public Enemy'' and extended to ``A Star Is Born,'' ``Nothing
Sacred,'' ``Beau Geste,'' and ``The Ox-Bow Incident,'' also was
passed over. Still, directors of Westerns and action films fared
better, predictably, than directors of comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Hawks, who moved easily between genres, barely made the
list with his screwball comedy ``Bringing Up Baby,'' which came in
97th. But Hawks's ``His Girl Friday,'' the best newspaper comedy of
them all, is nowhere to be found (nor is Hawks's classic Western,
``Red River''). Moreover, there isn't a single film by Preston
Sturges, who perfected comic anarchy on film, or Ernst Lubitsch,
whose so-called Lubitsch touch set the standard for sophisticated
comic battles between the sexes, but was ignored by voters. W.C.
Fields came up empty-handed, too. Subgenres fared even worse.
Independent films were non-starters. Sci-fi barely caused a blip on
the screen after ``Star Wars.'' Not even ``Blade Runner'' made it.
Except for the great ``Double Indemnity,'' film noir was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   When you consider what was left off the list, you wonder at some
of the titles that were given a shot. If ``Blade Runner,'' ``Top
Hat,'' ``The Magnificent Ambersons,'' ``Atlantic City,'' ``The Bank
Dick,'' ``The Awful Truth,'' ``The Lady Eve,'' and ``Trouble in
Paradise'' were shut out, so, at least, were ``Pretty Woman,''
``Beverly Hills Cop,'' ``Ferris Bueller's Day Off,'' and ``The
Fugitive.'' But what were the last four doing on a list of 400
greatest American films in the first place? Maybe what they were
doing was sending a message that all films were winners. Someday,
``Beverly Hills Cop'' will need to be preserved or transferred to
new stock, and why not?
</P>
<P>
   The late Andre Langlois, founder of the Cinema-theque in Paris,
a man who stored cans of film in his bathtub until they could be
housed safely elsewhere, said he felt he had no right to discard
any film, that all should be saved and that posterity should be
given the same chance to judge them that we were. It's an argument
I wouldn't dream of trying to refute. If the AFI list, and the
Library of Congress selections later this year, lead to an
increased awareness of older films, that many more will be saved _
and rediscovered and enjoyed. And that many more lists will be
possible.

SAN FRANCISCO AIRPORT OFFICIALS FACE DEBATE OVER RUNWAY EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIN McCORMICK  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Five years ago, as San Francisco leaders planned
one of the biggest airport makeovers in local history, they made a
promise to environmental regulators: no new runways until well
beyond 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the steel and concrete outlines of $2.4 billion in new
terminal buildings begin to rise above the airport construction
zone, the mantra has changed.
</P>
<P>
   With the airport's on-time service among the worst in the nation
and weather causing thousands of flight delays and cancellations,
officials say the airport desperately needs to expand its runways
just to handle the traffic it has today.
</P>
<P>
   As airport officials try to come up with a publicly acceptable
plan to extend runways into the San Francisco Bay, some passengers
are demanding to know why airport directors launched an expansion
without being able to accommodate more planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have this gorgeous, multibillion-dollar airport
that is one of the worst in the nation for delays,'' said San
Francisco lawyer James Woods, adding that his flights have been
delayed so often that he now takes pains to avoid using San
Francisco International Airport. ``Somebody's not thinking here.''
</P>
<P>
   But current and former airport planners say public demands have
changed. Nearly a decade ago, when city leaders discussed
modernizing the airport's 1930s-era runway system to reduce noise
and prepare for the future, they say the environmental opposition
to filling the Bay was so fierce the idea died.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been one to tie my hands behind my back, go out
into the political ring and let myself be hammered to bits,'' said
former Airports Director Lou Turpen, who commissioned a 1990 study
of how the airport's runways could be improved. Turpen said he
dropped the idea when it became clear that environmental opposition
might kill chances of any airport makeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a political football,'' said Turpen, who left San
Francisco in 1995 to become the director of Toronto's airport. ``It
wasn't going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead airport planners focused on building a new international
terminal to address the predicted boom in world travel _ a trend
expected to bring more passengers in larger airplanes, but not
necessarily an increase in the number of flights coming to the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   The number of passengers using the airport is expected to jump
67 percent between 1990 and 2006 _ to a total of nearly 51 million
per year. But the number of take-offs and landings at the airport
is expected to rise only 3 percent in the same time period.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal expansion now under way is the largest single
public works project ever in the San Francisco Bay area. It
includes a new international terminal with 26 flight gates, an
expanded customs facility, new long-term parking lots, a garage for
rental cars, and a light rail system around the airport _ all paid
for with airport revenues.
</P>
<P>
   As plans for this development were being approved, the Bay
Conservation and Development Commission, which must approve any
construction that intrudes on Bay waters, has said the project
should be subject to their review because it would inevitably lead
to the need for runway expansion.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1993 letter to the commission, Turpen vehemently denied
this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Current runway configurations will adequately handle projected
airline operations well into the next century,'' Turpen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, congestion on the airport's runways has grown from
an occasional annoyance to an all-out crisis, particularly with
recent weather problems blamed on the El Nino weather phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Stockwell, who commutes weekly between his home in Napa
County and his publishing job in San Diego, said missed connections
and airport delays have made his travel nearly impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``My company can't afford to send me through San Francisco
Airport anymore,'' he said. ``It just takes too much time.''
</P>
<P>
   At peak travel times, the airport's parallel runways are booked
to capacity _ about 60 landings per hour in clear weather, when two
planes can land side-by-side.
</P>
<P>
   Since San Francisco's runways are only 750 feet apart, all it
takes is a few clouds to knock the whole system into chaos. When
visibility drops, the airport can land planes on only one runway,
cutting in half the number of planes that can get to San Francisco.
The Federal Aviation Administration requires runways be 4,200 feet
apart for dual landings in inclement weather.
</P>
<P>
   The delays in San Francisco creates a domino effect, keeping
planes on the ground at airports around the country. In San
Francisco, it has regularly caused dozens of flight cancellations
and left terminals packed with angry, stranded passengers.

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Expanding the runway system is likely to mean building out into
environmentally sensitive Bay waters.
</P>
<P>
   The airport has offered to do some sort of massive Bay
restoration project as a trade-off for the environmental damage
that might be caused by the new runways.
</P>
<P>
   Under one proposal, the airport would buy 29,000 acres of South
Bay salt ponds and restore them to their original wetlands state,
in what would be one of the largest mitigation efforts in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they're dangling the carrot of major wetlands
restoration in the South Bay has sweetened the pot for some
people,'' said Will Burns of Save the Bay, acknowledging that
environmentalists might be more open to the project now than 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns said he believes the airport has known all along it
would need to expand its runway system and simply broke the project
into two pieces to stymie the environmental opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The terminal expansion is worth nothing without taking the
next step,'' he said. ``They knew that when they started.''

HAIR SALON STRIVES FOR SOMETHING DIFFERENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Flip through an Elle magazine at Vain and you realize
this isn't your grandmother's beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
   Someone has taken a black Magic Marker and scrawled ``SEXISM
HARDCORE'' across Christy Turlington's bra-and-panty-clad torso in
a Calvin Klein ad.
</P>
<P>
   You look up and see Hannah Levin, a 27-year-old rock band
manager, admiring the platinum-blond stripes that now race through
her dark tresses.
</P>
<P>
   But then Jeanne Barrett, who is a bona-fide white-haired
grandmother from Leschi, pops in for a quick trim on her short,
``wash-and-run'' style.
</P>
<P>
   Both women feel at home at Vain, a Belltown mecca of magenta
hair dye, industrial-strength gel, grass-roots activism and
post-punk urban chic.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point, says owner Victoria Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to walk in and feel like they're going to
be ridiculed if they want something different,'' she says. ``(But)
I also want people who want something more conservative to feel
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, 34, has created some waves in the beauty industry with
her 2-year-old Seattle salon, quirky hair-care products, unorthodox
business practices and vow to celebrate ``alternative visions of
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Vain, at 2222 Second Ave., has been featured in magazines such
as Redbook, Jane and Siren and in The New York Times lifestyles
section.
</P>
<P>
   Clients include band members of the Posies and Screaming Trees,
and the salon has its own Web site at www.vain.com
</P>
<P>
   Gentry's philosophy? Give the people what they want, whether
it's access to ``professional-only'' hair dyes or purple mohawks.
</P>
<P>
   Her customers leave Vain with glossy Marlo Thomas flips. Streaks
of fire-engine red. Spiky punk looks. And, yes, even conservative
bobs and crew cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it is people looking for a transformation,'' she says.
``They don't like fluffy hair. They want hair that has texture.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve it, Gentry developed her own line of Vain products
with tongue-in-cheek slogans. They include ``2nd Day Hair: Shampoo
for marginally clean hair'' and ``Dirty Boy, Dirty Girl: Hair goo
for the rumpled masses.''
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey native, Gentry has streaks of ``cherry bomb'' red
in her own dark, shag-cut hair. She started cutting locks as a
punk-rock teenager when she experimented on friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of my brother's tracked me down on the Internet the
other day,'' she says. ``He said, `You gave me the most ridiculous
haircuts I've ever had.'''
</P>
<P>
   At 21, she enrolled in the Artistic Academy of Hair Design in
Fair Lawn, N.J. Her instructors were wide-eyed, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just upset at what my vision of beauty was,'' she
says. ``I only knew how to do mohawks.''
</P>
<P>
   To gain experience, she worked at a New Jersey mall salon and
perfected the ``big hair'' popular with customers there. But Gentry
soon tired of cookie-cutter styles and crossed the Hudson River for
liberation.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, she worked at an East Village salon in
Manhattan and amassed a loyal following of rock musicians, record
producers and artists. She also served as a hairstylist on
Lollapalooza tours.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she moved to Seattle and opened Vain. Her mission? One,
do something about the lackluster long hair that dominated the
grunge scene. And two, open a beauty shop that wasn't stuffy or
pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   The city also seemed perfect for her activist spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a very good demographic,'' she says. ``It
was a growing city. I wanted to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   At Vain, Gentry keeps a kiosk stocked with American Cancer
Society brochures, free condoms, a list of organizations that do
animal research and information on Home Alive, a Seattle group that
offers self-defense classes for women.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry is a Home Alive advisory board member, has volunteered
with campaigns to free a Pennsylvania death row inmate and is
planning ``Hero Sisters,'' a conference to introduce girls to women
in non-traditional careers.
</P>
<P>
   She also wants to change an industry notorious for sticking it
to women _ narrow-minded beauty standards for exorbitant prices.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbing her nose at other salons, Gentry sells
professional-use-only hair dyes and supplies to do-it-yourselfers.
Usually such products are not available to clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's garbage,'' Gentry says. ``I want this to be
like a laboratory environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her peers, some are encouraging, others skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   One Belltown stylist, who wouldn't give her name, praised Gentry
for breathing life into the snooty world of upscale hair salons.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does that very edgy kind of thing,'' she said. ``You know,
a lot of crazy, fun colors. It's really great.''
</P>
<P>
   But another wondered if Gentry could be held legally liable,
say, if a customer buys professional-only dye and then damages her
hair or burns her eyes while using it at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not supposed to do that,'' said Joevir Morada, a
stylist at Fernando's Salon in Belltown. ``They will be held
responsible for whatever happens to their client. The coloring says
for professional use only.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gentry says she instructs customers interested in dying
their hair at home with salon-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to be excited about creating their own styles,''
she says. ``Not `I want to be Cindy Crawford.' I want them to be
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Vain's red walls are not plastered with photos of models and
movie stars. And customers are encouraged to develop their own
styles with the help of staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Her clients are mostly music industry types, but they also
include lawyers, doctors and people with more conservative looks.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, the 72-year-old grandmother, settled into a chair at
Vain. She said she had just finished modeling for a photographer
friend who was shooting a magazine ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know for what,'' she teased. ``It might be an HMO. It
might be `Depends.' '
</P>
<P>
   Gentry giggled.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, the band manager, thumbed through a Rolling Stone. She's
been a customer for six months and couldn't be happier with the
Vain philosophy _ and the prices (cuts start at $28 and include
free trims).
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go to an insanely expensive salon downtown where the
stylists were all very elitist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a salon that feels feminist _ where you can be
interested in how you look, but not a slave to Mademoiselle.''

WHAT DO SPIDERS DO WITH EIGHT EYES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By USHA LEE MCFARLING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How do spiders control eight eyes? What kind of vision would
that be like? Do they have good vision or just simple contrast
change?
</P>
<P>
   A.C., West Tisbury, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Most spiders aren't known for their vision. They're known for
their remarkable mechanoreception _ the ability to sense the
tiniest of vibrations and perturbations. This, of course, helps
web-spinning spiders find entangled prey.
</P>
<P>
   But a few spiders, most notably jumpers, have excellent vision.
These spiders don't spin webs. Instead they hunt for prey, prowling
and pouncing on unsuspecting victims much like lions, says Wayne
Maddison, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona
who studies the creatures. That strategy isn't possible for the
more myopic species. To find tiny prey amid foliage, they must be
able to detect moving objects. Then, to effectively leap onto on
their prey, the spiders must be able to judge distance. They have
different eyes for different tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping spiders have two big eyes in the center of their faces.
These eyes are similar to ours. They have excellent resolution and
can judge distance by comparing the difference in the image
produced by each eye. It's thought that these spiders, just a few
millimeters in size, can see well at distances up to a foot. Such
vision approaches that of primates.
</P>
<P>
   The other six eyes, which are smaller and arranged in rows on
the face and upper body of the spider, are used as motion
detectors. Because some of the eyes are fixed in the hard outer
shell of the spiders, the spider must move its whole head to see
objects. They can also rotate their retinas without moving their
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their excellent vision, jumping spiders can be a lot
of fun to watch. ``They react to the world a lot like we do,'' says
Maddison. ``Most mammals run around bumping into things and
smelling them, but jumping spiders look around before they jump.
When you watch them, it's familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   If you place one on your hand, it will follow your movements
with an attention unusual for an invertebrate, writes W.J. Gertsch,
author of ``American Spiders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fine eyesight has made them the outstanding spider
extroverts,'' Gertsch writes.
</P>
<P>
   But what does the world look like to a spider? And how is this
rich visual information integrated? That, says Maddison, is still
unknown, primarily because it's difficult to study a spider's
nervous system _ work usually done with electrodes inserted into an
animal's visual nerves. With a spider, that's technically
difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether they put together an overall image in the brain, we
just don't know,'' says Maddison. ``It's hard to say what the
mind's eye of a jumping spider is.''
</P>
<P>
   By watching the animal's behavior, however, it is possible to
get some idea of what their world is like. For instance, it's
assumed that they judge distance well because they jump so
accurately. It's also assumed that they can see color because
colorful plumes, feathers and fringes on the legs and bodies of
male spiders are a crucial part of the animals' leg-waving
courtship rituals. Many male jumping spiders are ``as colorful as
birds of paradise,'' says Maddison.

EX-CLINTON BUDDY MCDOUGAL'S REVELATIONS NOT TOTALLY BELIEVABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hell hath no fury like a business partner scorned. Jim McDougal
vowed to become Bill Clinton's ``worst nightmare'' two years ago,
when he abandoned his longtime defense of the president and started
telling Ken Starr what the Whitewater special prosecutor wanted to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal died in a prison hospital early this year, just as he
was wrapping up ``Arkansas Mischief: The Birth of a National
Scandal,'' a book co-written with Boston Globe reporter Curtis
Wilkie.
</P>
<P>
   The two Deep South populists have produced a book that is
immensely readable but not always believable.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in part, a modern political history of Arkansas, seen
through the eyes of a country boy who set out to do good and then
tried to do well. McDougal depicts a factionalized, one-party state
in which public and private business were freely intermingled.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, powerful Sen. John McClellan, Congress' leading
prober of organized crime, pulls eight dollars from his billfold
and asks a lobbyist buddy to buy him a pair of alligator shoes back
in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goddamn, senator,'' the lobbyist replies, ``They cost
sixty-four dollars. And besides, that's the first time I ever saw
you pull anything besides a handkerchief out of your pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougal has an initial knack for real estate deals, and makes a
bundle for such employers as Sen. J. William Fulbright. He has
spotted what seems like a sure-shot deal on the White River when
McDougal and his wife, Susan, run into the Clintons in a Little
Rock restaurant. It's 1978 and Bill Clinton will soon be elected
America's youngest governor. After a five-minute conversation, Bill
and Hillary Clinton were signed on as partners in the venture
called Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal presents a familiar view of Clinton. The future
president is charming, vastly intelligent and full of himself.
Clinton signs on as Fulbright's driver when the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee chairman is fighting a tough 1968 re-election
battle. But he promptly gets into arguments with Fulbright and is
banished from the car.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Hillary Clinton is compared to Lady Macbeth. It is
her cold, harsh treatment of Susan McDougal that helps persuade
ex-hubby Jim to start spilling the beans to Jeff Gerth of The New
York Times in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Once he told Clinton's 1990 gubernatorial opponent Sheffield
Nelson that there were beans to spill, McDougal was quickly passed
up the conservative food chain. ``Arkansas Mischief'' reveals a
high degree of collusion among Clinton's enemies, and extensive
cooperation between those enemies and dirt-digging Washington,
D.C., reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arkansas Mischief'' starts out as an entertaining tale, and a
clear-eyed look at how political decisions really get made in a
backwater state. But _ like Jim McDougal's career _ it comes
unglued.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the bitterness comes a basic point. If the Clintons
had reciprocated the loyalty and favors shown to them, a bitter man
would never have set in motion the scandal that has bedeviled an
otherwise successful presidency for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whitewater case unfolded because I wanted Bill Clinton to
feel my pain,'' writes Jim McDougal. In that assertion, at least,
he is wholly believable.

RESTARTING CONNECTICUT REACTOR REFUELS ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERFORD, Conn. _ Sometime this week an operator deep inside
the Millstone 3 nuclear reactor will throw a switch that ends one
of the darkest periods in the history of the US nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   After a 27-month shutdown, a record fine for safety violations,
and a staggering $1.3 billion in costs to the owners, New England's
largest power plant will begin splitting atoms again, in time for
the summer season when electricity demand is highest.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Millstone officials still face immense challenges.
Like a nuclear Rip Van Winkle, Millstone 3 will wake to a changed
world that is getting tough on nuclear power. Growing pressure for
utilities to compete, coupled with aging parts, forced two of the
region's eight reactors to close permanently while the three
reactors at Millstone were out, and Millstone 1, the oldest reactor
at the site, could be next.
</P>
<P>
   But, after what they've been through, it's hard to blame chief
nuclear officer Bruce Kenyon for planning a celebration on the
nuclear plant's lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from thousands of issues down to a handful and it's
starting to sink in to everyone'' that start-up is imminent, said
Kenyon, the orderly troubleshooter who came in 1996 to turn around
what regulators then regarded as America's worst-run nuclear plant.
``I'm starting to get excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves Millstone's work
on a few minor problems, operators can begin to ``pull rods,''
removing the control rods inside the reactor that act as a brake on
nuclear reactions. Then, over the next four to six weeks, workers
will gradually bring Millstone 3 to full power.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Millstone 3 will boost New England's power supply,
which has nearly run short the last two summers due to problems at
nuclear plants. With only two of the region's reactors running on
Friday, utility officials appealed for conservation throughout New
England to avoid shortages.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the people of southeastern Connecticut, a bastion of
pro-nuclear sentiment with its nuclear submarine base and submarine
manufacturing plant, the last two years have been disillusioning.
Though Millstone has a community support group, many residents are
wary of their nuclear neighbor and a local citizens group believes
the restart is too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company still has a lot of work to do in regaining the
trust and confidence of people ... because its record of
mismanagement under previous leadership gives no cause for great
confidence,'' said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal,
a critic of Millstone owner Northeast Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the steam clouds rising from tests inside Millstone 3
underscore a striking turn from early 1996 when troubles at the
plant made the cover of Time magazine and forced a shutdown. Dozens
of workers said they had been harassed by management for raising
safety concerns, and regulators were accused of looking the other
way as managers cut sometimes-dangerous corners.
</P>
<P>
   Workers said Northeast Utilities, New England's largest utility,
had become gripped by ``megawatt fever,'' a term for managers
obsessed with the huge cost of idling a nuclear plant for a single
day. They pushed workers to undertake risky repairs while the
reactor was running and store radioactive fuel in an inadequate
cooling tank to save time.
</P>
<P>
   By September 1996, when Kenyon arrived, Millstone was on the
lowest rung of the NRC's ``watch list'' of troubled plants,
requiring a formal vote of the commissioners to restart. So low was
NRC trust in plant officials that they took the unprecendented step
of hiring a contractor to double check virtually every significant
reform plant managers undertook.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon, a respected senior executive with South Carolina
Electric and Gas and former chief of Millstone 2, immediately
replaced the whole Millstone management team _ mainly with
outsiders _ but he discovered that the job was much more difficult
than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found an organization that was demoralized, struggling to
find a direction ... wanting to do what's right, having lost
confidence in the leadership,'' said Kenyon, sitting by his window
overlooking the sprawling industrial complex on the edge of Niantic
Bay. As a result, he had to repeatedly push back his goals for
starting up the reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other long nuclear plant outages, where the biggest
problems were broken equipment, Kenyon had to fix a broken
workplace culture. Millstone officials have spent more than $500
million on improving the nuclear reactors, almost none of it on
construction, and a good amount of it on convincing workers to
speak their minds again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I found the hardest to do is to rebuild a climate of
trust in an atmosphere of distrust,'' said Kenyon, his tanned face
deeply lined as he smiles. ``There was a segment of the employee
population whose sense of trust was so damaged that it was really
digging out of a deep hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prove his sincerity, Kenyon even hired one of the
harshest Millstone critics, former Millstone engineer Paul Blanch.
Northeast Utilities had been fined $100,000 in 1993 to settle
Blanch's harassment charges and Blanch had gone on to organize the
Citizens Regulatory Commission to publicize Millstone safety
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Blanch, a consultant who helps resolve employee concerns before
they become a crisis, believes that Kenyon has made Millstone safe
enough to generate power again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people are comfortable that they can raise issues
without the fear of retaliation,'' said Blanch, a claim backed up
by the fact that Millstone now responds to more employee concerns
than any other nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
   But others feel that the old Millstone, and the old cozy
relationship with the NRC, is just below the surface. Ernest
Hadley, attorney for the employee whistleblower who hurt Millstone
managers the most, believes neither the company nor NRC officials
learned their lessons because no one was punished. Senior managers
for Northeast Utilities and the NRC escaped with honors, profit or
both, while a criminal investigation into a possible coverup of
violations by the US Attorney in Connecticut has languished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was held personally accountable. They can't fine these
people enough'' to make them change behavior, said Hadley, who is
based in Massachusetts. ``The way you hold people accountable is...
you send them to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   NRC officials, who found their credibility challenged as never
before in the wake of the Millstone scandal, counter that they have
taken unprecedented steps to make sure Millstone is safe. The
agency has spent more time at Millstone, measured in the hundreds
of thousands of hours, than anywhere else in the country, and fined
Northeast Utilities a record $2.1 million last December.
</P>
<P>
   Millstone officials say they have learned their lesson also,
fixing at least 20,000 problems at Millstone 3 alone, and
consistently choosing to delay the restart when faced with
difficulties. Now, they feel, the only thing to do is start the
reactor, expected to get NRC approval any day.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is far less rosy for Millstone 1, a 1970 vintage
reactor that provides a quarter of the 2,680 megawatts at
Millstone. Work on the reactor halted last year after a company
study showed a relatively small $70 million advantage to keeping
the reactor open. If a study next month is even more unfavorable,
as many expect, Northeast Utilities could decide to close the
reactor for good.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Utilities is bullish on Millstone 2, which managers
hope to restart by year's end. And the startup of Millstone 3 gives
the company much-needed income to reduce the $30 million that
Millstone's owners pay for replacement power.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate fate of the reactors at Millstone may have as
much to do with the competition as anything Millstone officials do.
Dozens of efficient facilities that burn natural gas have been
proposed for New England, based partly on the belief that the
owners can charge less for electricity than existing plants,
driving some of them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, construction began on a new gas plant in
Charlton, Mass., a project that owner PG&AMP;E Corporation called ``a
model... for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But Northeast Utilities, unique among New England utilities,
will live or die by its nuclear plants. As the owner or part-owner
of five reactors, all of which would be hard to sell, Northeast has
little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon is aware of the challenges. ``It is not time to sit back
and rest on our laurels,'' he said. ``Our performance is solid
enough for restart, but we have not reached excellence and ...
that's where we need to be.''

   ``Virtually every city or town in New England had at least one
small mill or shop, and they really have disappeared,'' says
Richard Candee, a Boston University professor and director of
Preservation Studies, though a few soldier on in the area's mill
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few textile companies that are still doing well by
developing a specialty product and holding on hard to it,'' says
Candee. He added that some other mills, like the Schwamb Mill in
Arlington, Mass. that makes oval picture frames, have been kept
alive as working museums.
</P>
<P>
   New England's great industries and its natural beauty spawned
great literature. And now that they are vanishing, so too may be
the literary opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will not have someone writing about the whaling industry,
and you will not have people writing about the old customs house in
Salem, (Mass.) or camping on the pond,'' says Peter Davison, a
Boston editor and poet.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe that the next great wave of literature
might be about spreadsheets and e-mail. But even if it is, the
venue could just as easily be Silicon Valley or Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Even regional accents and colloquialisms _ the linguistic stamp
of who we are _ are starting to slip, says Maine humorist Tim
Sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a verbal shorthand and has a very pragmatic role of
identifying someone as being from your tribe, or from away,'' says
Sample, who grew up in Boothbay Harbor and now lives in Bath. He
says there has been a dilution of the Downeast accent, caused by
the ``influx of people and the morphing of demographics along the
coast of Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that, sadly but inevitably, happens as these
cultural and social touchstones diminish is it falls to people in
the arts, writers and performers to preserve them.''
</P>
<P>
   That this is happening in Maine is remarkable, Sample says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainers have a long tradition of resisting change, and it has
stood us in pretty good stead. Maine would be a lousy place to
start a new religion. If you go to California, you could get 100
devotees in the first month. After six years in Maine, you might
get one person coming to your meeting. `New' is not a good
adjective to use when pushing something in Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Green, a Boston university English professor, says that
many local terms in use as recently as 50 years ago, are
disappearing. ``I'm not sure people say `dropped eggs' anymore
instead of poached eggs; I'm not sure people say `tonic' instead of
soda. Do you know what a jug-o-rum is? It's a bullfrog. `Peepers'
are spring frogs. People used to say bellybunt for bellyflop. The
second crop of hay was called a `rowen.'''
</P>
<P>
   William Kretzschmer, a professor of English and linguistics at
the University of Gerogia, where he directs the American Linguistic
Atlas Project, says the perception is ``that there is more and more
speech that does not sound like it comes from anywhere is true.''
But the suppression of regional accents, he says, still occurs
mostly in college-educated, upper-middle-class people. Dialects
still thrive in many middle- and lower-class families.
</P>
<P>
   The postcard New England of pristine mountain forests and
endless beaches is harder than ever to find, especially in the
summer or during foliage season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it is manufactured and artificial,'' says Judson D.
Hale, the editor of Yankee magazine. ``And when you do go to the
icon places where so many Europeans and Americans go, you will be
surrounded by places that are cheap and shabby. If you go to where
Paul Revere lived, you might end up buying some T-shirts, but Paul
Revere really did live there.''
</P>
<P>
   New England, says O'Connor, is becoming ``multicultural,
multilingual, highly technically industrialized, overpopulated and
over polluted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are wonderful oceans out there. But instead of the lone
white sailboat, there are jet skis careening at 80 miles an hour.
But we still like to think of it the old way ... It might be that
we are in a period of nostalgia, choosing to ignore the realities
of the present and future, preferring instead to dream our dream of
what Cape Cod and Boston was like _ small winding streets and
little shops. But Boston is a multinational city of finance and
real estate that bears very little relationship to what we like to
think it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale is far from ready to abandon New England as Anyplace USA,
despite the Wal-Marts at the edge of many rural towns, the Red
Lobster Restaurants in Maine, and the myriad outlet stores _ from
Manchester, Vt., to Freeport, Maine _ that have become a late
20th-century version of the New England country store.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human condition is to regret what is passing by,'' says
Hale. ``But I think there is a great effort across New England to
strengthen its image. People are working hard to keep that image
and our culture autonomous. The mountains always stay the same.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes that New England sensibilities still run strong. During
the 1980s, for example, when the Celtics were battling the Los
Angeles Lakers for basketball supremecy, ``we did not mind the
Lakers team so much, but we hated the hoopla, the cheerleaders, the
movie stars along the sidelines. It was so different in Boston
Garden, it was really New England.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the Garden is gone and in its place is the Fleet Center,
a cookie cutter arena that could be a major league sporting venue
in any other major city. The building has no obstructed-view seats,
but it also _ at least so far _ has no soul.
</P>
<P>
   If the six states of New England have one sports team that binds
them together, it is the Red Sox, with their century-old tradition.
But even the Red Sox of today are blur of players who are unlikely
to spend a career here. Since Dwight Evans _ who spent 17 years
patroling right field _ left in 1990, the team has had 33 players
in that position. Jerry Seinfeld's schtick about fans rooting for
laundry has some truth to it. Many fans pay to see the team in
large part to experience venerable Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, it appears, will soon be gone.

WOMEN ALSO OFTEN DENIED COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not just kids with facial deformities who face hurdles in
getting insurance coverage for reconstructive surgery. It's women
seeking breast reconstruction or reduction surgery, too.
</P>
<P>
   While many women who have lost a breast to cancer seek
reconstruction of that breast and reduction of the opposite breast
to achieve a symmetrical appearance, some women without cancer also
request reduction surgery because of the neck, shoulder, and back
pain that can result from heavy breasts.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey, 84 percent of members of the American
Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons said that in a
one-year as many as 10 of their patients had been denied coverage
for breast reconstructive surgery. The surgeons' group is still
collecting data on reduction surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 26 states have passed laws to ensure access to
reconstructive surgery, including secondary surgeries if, as often
happens, the first one doesn't yield the desired result.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; When surgeons are reconstructing a breast after mastectomy or
reducing the opposite breast, the result ``cannot always be perfect
the first time,'' says Dr. Sumner Slavin , a plastic surgeon at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and immediate past
president of the New England Society of Plastic Surgeons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem is in obtaining coverage for breast
reduction. Traditionally, this has been considered a `medically
necesssary' procedure. Now, insurers are insisting that a woman be
no more than a certain percent above ideal body weight and that
surgeons remove a lot of tissue _ often 500 grams (almost a pound)
from each breast to be reduced,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Removing 500 grams may be appropriate in a large woman, he says,
but not in a small woman.
</P>
<P>
   In late December, for instance, Tufts Health Plan sent letter to
doctors clarifying what it said had long been its policy: it would
pay for breast reduction surgery only when ``medically necessary.''
Because of longstanding complaints from doctors, the plan did agree
to fund surgeries to remove slightly less than 500 grams from each
breast in smaller women, says Dr. Lisa Letourneau, a medical
director at Tufts.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, the Senate Ways and Means committee is
considering a bill (by Democratic Sen. Lois Pines of Newton)
calling for insurers to pay the full cost of all stages of
reconstruction surgery for women who have had mastectomies,
including reduction surgery if necessary. Maryland, Maine, and
Connecticut have passed similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   A similar bill by Sen. Mark Montigny (D-New Bedford) is still
before the insurance committee, a preliminary stage.

SCIENTISTS ARE BEGINNING TO SEE HOW THE UNIVERSE WILL END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  How old is the universe? How will it end? What is it all made
of? After centuries of wondering, and decades of painstaking and
frustrating research, scientists may be close to answering those
fundamental questions.
</P>
<P>
   It all comes down to the search for three numbers: The key
measurements that will reveal the universe's past, its present, and
its future _ including its ultimate fate. Scientists have startled
themselves with the recent progress they've made toward figuring
out what those numbers are.
</P>
<P>
   The three numbers that will describe what scientists refer to as
the ``shape'' of the universe _ whether it is ``open'' and will
expand forever, or ``closed'' and will eventually come crashing
back together, or something in between _ are these: The speed of
the universe's expansion, called the Hubble constant; the amount of
matter in the universe, called the density parameter; and a
peculiar number called the cosmological constant, which describes
whether, and if so how much, empty space exerts a pressure of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The degree of precision that we now have in determining''
these basic measurements ``would have been deemed inconceivable a
decade ago,'' said John Bahcall, an astrophycisist at the Institute
for Advanced Study in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, several groups carrying out different
kinds of research _ some looking at neutrinos, the tiniest, most
lightweight objects known to exist; some looking at supernovae, the
most colossal explosive events known; and others looking at aspects
of the vast realm in between _ are pinning down the answers to what
scientists consider some of the biggest puzzles of all.
</P>
<P>
   As Peter Coles of the University of London wrote in the current
issue of the journal Nature, ``the standard ideas of the 1980s
about the shape and history of the Universe have now been
abandoned,'' leading to a ``new model universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few months ago, most astronomers acknowledged that they
only knew what made up less than 10 percent of the universe. The
new findings remain controversial, and a massive influx of data
expected over the next few years could change everything, but now
it is just possible that virtually all of the stuff of the cosmos
has finally been identified.
</P>
<P>
   The new data suggest some intriguing conclusions. One is that
the ``shape'' of the universe lies poised exactly in between the
theoretically possible extremes, eternal expansion and ultimate
collapse: In the parlance of physics, it is perfectly ``flat,''
although with an unexpected acceleration. And, even more
surprisingly, about two-thirds of the ``stuff'' that makes up the
universe may consist of neither matter nor energy; it may be,
instead, a mysterious phenomenon that produces a universal push out
of pure nothingness. It is this phenomenon that is measured by the
``cosmological constant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a really weird result,'' conceded Robert Kirshner of
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, a member of one of
the teams whose research has produced this revolution in cosmology.
``You thought we were telling a fairy tale before!''
</P>
<P>
   The weird result emerged from his group's study of very distant
exploding stars, or supernovae. They found that the more distant
supernovae _ up to 5 billion light years away _ are moving more
slowly than those closer to us. Because we see those galaxies as
they were 5 billion years ago, this suggests that the expansion of
the universe _ the rate at which all the galaxies in space are
flying apart _ is actually speeding up.
</P>
<P>
   Theorists have long known that because everything in the
universe exerts a gravitational pull on everything else, the
expansion should be slowing down. So what could explain this
paradoxical acceleration? Most scientists now think that _ assuming
the supernova findings are correct _ this implies that there really
is a ``cosmological constant,'' a kind of pressure exerted by sheer
vacuum that pushes everything apart; it's sort of like the
science-fiction notion of ``antigravity.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept was first suggested, and then hastily retracted, by
physicist Albert Einstein in the 1920s. Einstein found the idea
disturbing because it implied that the universe was expanding _
scientific heresy in an era when everyong thought that it was
static and unchanging. But just a few years later, astronomer Edwin
Hubble's observations of the motions of distant galaxies proved
once and for all that the universe really is expanding; that
discovery, in turn, gave rise to the Big Bang theory, and modern
cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many scientists are still troubled by the idea of a
cosmological constant, which suggests, as Kirshner put it, ``that
space has this spongy quality to it.'' Until the new supernova
evidence came along, the idea had almost disappeared from
scientific discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is strong, but not yet conclusive. As Kirshner and
others on the supernova team readily acknowledge, there may be some
other explanation. For example, what they observed was a difference
in the brightness of nearby and distant supernovae, which they
attributed to a difference in their velocity. Maybe, instead, it is
the supernovae themselves that differ in some way.
</P>
<P>
   Bahcall is one of those who takes the cosmological constant
interpretation with a grain of salt. Theoretical calculations, he
said, suggest that if it exists at all, it should be much, much
bigger than the supernova data indicates.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a right to be skeptical,'' Kirshner said, ``but
not infinitely skeptical.'' And his group is continuing its search
for clearer evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The supernova evidence so far, widely reported in the field but
not yet formally published, comes on top of other recent major
finds that also have helped to close in on some of these key
numbers that shape our fate: First, the discovery by five
independent teams, reported in January, that there is not nearly
enough matter in the universe to produce the gravitational pull
needed to halt its expansion and eventually make the universe
collapse upon itself in a ``big crunch,'' or even to make it
``flat.'' Then, the discovery reported a few weeks ago that tiny
particles called neutrinos do have mass. It had long thought likely
that they had none.
</P>
<P>
   The minuscule mass of the neutrino may account for some of the
missing, or ``dark matter'' in space _ matter that is not visible
by any ordinary means. But because the neutrino mass is apparently
so tiny, it adds to the evidence that there's not enough matter out
there to cause a big crunch or a flat universe.
</P>
<P>
   The neutrino discovery was made by an international team using a
detector in Japan called Super-Kamiokande _ a huge underground
cavern filled with water to detect faint flashes of light that show
the passage of a neutrino. The experiment proved that these tiniest
of all subatomic particles are not weightless, as light is, but
have some measurable mass. But it did not reveal just what that
mass is; it only showed that there is a third type, in addition to
the two previously known, and measured the differences in their
mass.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists say the finding suggests that, at most, neutrinos
might account for about 10 percent of the matter needed for a
``flat'' universe. That's not enough to make any difference in the
basic Big Bang theory, but it could turn out to be enough to make a
big difference in explaining how galaxies formed, said theoretical
physicist Alan Guth of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
``It would change the theories quite a bit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But all the recent findings suggest that the universe contains
only about 20 to 30 percent as much matter as most theories,
including Guth's, predicted there must be _ an amount called the
``critical density.''
</P>
<P>
   That shortcoming could have been fatal to those widely accepted
theories _ except that, as luck would have it, along came the
evidence for a cosmological constant, just what was needed to fill
the critical density gap.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In the equations that describe the birth and growth of the
universe, the cosmological constant is equivalent to matter, even
though it has no physical substance. And the measurement of the
cosmological constant derived from the supernova research is just
the amount needed to account for the 70 percent or so of the
critical-density mass that was missing.
</P>
<P>
   That provides the amount needed to produce the ``flat'' universe
that most theories say exists _ including Guth's ``inflationary
universe'' theory, which has become the prevailing cosmological
paradigm. It holds that the universe underwent a brief flash of
enormously accelerated expansion during a tiny fraction of a second
after the Big Bang.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these observations are right, then we've found the critical
density,'' said Guth. But, he added, ``it's certainly a surprise,''
because nobody had been expecting a cosmological constant to be the
thing that would fill the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly changes our view of cosmology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there's much more to come. New surveys of the entire sky,
including the massive Sloan Digital Sky Survey that reported its
first observations three weeks ago, and new satellites, including
one called the Microwave Anisotropy Probe, designed to find ripples
in the cosmic background radiation _ the echoes of the Big Bang _
are expected to produce reams of data in the next few years that
could pin down once and for all the three numbers that describe the
universe's shape and its fate.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few years, said Guth, the basic numbers that describe
the universe may be nailed down to within about 10 percent _ which,
in theoretical physics, counts as astonishing precision.
</P>
<P>
   As the astronomer Coles put it in his article in Nature, ``a
data explosion is about to engulf cosmology.''

RESTARTING CONNECTICUT REACTOR REFUELS ISSUES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WATERFORD, Conn. _ Sometime this week an operator deep inside
the Millstone 3 nuclear reactor will throw a switch that ends one
of the darkest periods in the history of the US nuclear industry.
</P>
<P>
   After a 27-month shutdown, a record fine for safety violations,
and a staggering $1.3 billion in costs to the owners, New England's
largest power plant will begin splitting atoms again, in time for
the summer season when electricity demand is highest.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Millstone officials still face immense challenges.
Like a nuclear Rip Van Winkle, Millstone 3 will wake to a changed
world that is getting tough on nuclear power. Growing pressure for
utilities to compete, coupled with aging parts, forced two of the
region's eight reactors to close permanently while the three
reactors at Millstone were out, and Millstone 1, the oldest reactor
at the site, could be next.
</P>
<P>
   But, after what they've been through, it's hard to blame chief
nuclear officer Bruce Kenyon for planning a celebration on the
nuclear plant's lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone from thousands of issues down to a handful and it's
starting to sink in to everyone'' that start-up is imminent, said
Kenyon, the orderly troubleshooter who came in 1996 to turn around
what regulators then regarded as America's worst-run nuclear plant.
``I'm starting to get excited.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Nuclear Regulatory Commission approves Millstone's work
on a few minor problems, operators can begin to ``pull rods,''
removing the control rods inside the reactor that act as a brake on
nuclear reactions. Then, over the next four to six weeks, workers
will gradually bring Millstone 3 to full power.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Millstone 3 will boost New England's power supply,
which has nearly run short the last two summers due to problems at
nuclear plants. With only two of the region's reactors running on
Friday, utility officials appealed for conservation throughout New
England to avoid shortages.
</P>
<P>
   But, for the people of southeastern Connecticut, a bastion of
pro-nuclear sentiment with its nuclear submarine base and submarine
manufacturing plant, the last two years have been disillusioning.
Though Millstone has a community support group, many residents are
wary of their nuclear neighbor and a local citizens group believes
the restart is too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company still has a lot of work to do in regaining the
trust and confidence of people ... because its record of
mismanagement under previous leadership gives no cause for great
confidence,'' said Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal,
a critic of Millstone owner Northeast Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the steam clouds rising from tests inside Millstone 3
underscore a striking turn from early 1996 when troubles at the
plant made the cover of Time magazine and forced a shutdown. Dozens
of workers said they had been harassed by management for raising
safety concerns, and regulators were accused of looking the other
way as managers cut sometimes-dangerous corners.
</P>
<P>
   Workers said Northeast Utilities, New England's largest utility,
had become gripped by ``megawatt fever,'' a term for managers
obsessed with the huge cost of idling a nuclear plant for a single
day. They pushed workers to undertake risky repairs while the
reactor was running and store radioactive fuel in an inadequate
cooling tank to save time.
</P>
<P>
   By September 1996, when Kenyon arrived, Millstone was on the
lowest rung of the NRC's ``watch list'' of troubled plants,
requiring a formal vote of the commissioners to restart. So low was
NRC trust in plant officials that they took the unprecendented step
of hiring a contractor to double check virtually every significant
reform plant managers undertook.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon, a respected senior executive with South Carolina
Electric and Gas and former chief of Millstone 2, immediately
replaced the whole Millstone management team _ mainly with
outsiders _ but he discovered that the job was much more difficult
than he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found an organization that was demoralized, struggling to
find a direction ... wanting to do what's right, having lost
confidence in the leadership,'' said Kenyon, sitting by his window
overlooking the sprawling industrial complex on the edge of Niantic
Bay. As a result, he had to repeatedly push back his goals for
starting up the reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other long nuclear plant outages, where the biggest
problems were broken equipment, Kenyon had to fix a broken
workplace culture. Millstone officials have spent more than $500
million on improving the nuclear reactors, almost none of it on
construction, and a good amount of it on convincing workers to
speak their minds again.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I found the hardest to do is to rebuild a climate of
trust in an atmosphere of distrust,'' said Kenyon, his tanned face
deeply lined as he smiles. ``There was a segment of the employee
population whose sense of trust was so damaged that it was really
digging out of a deep hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prove his sincerity, Kenyon even hired one of the
harshest Millstone critics, former Millstone engineer Paul Blanch.
Northeast Utilities had been fined $100,000 in 1993 to settle
Blanch's harassment charges and Blanch had gone on to organize the
Citizens Regulatory Commission to publicize Millstone safety
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Blanch, a consultant who helps resolve employee concerns before
they become a crisis, believes that Kenyon has made Millstone safe
enough to generate power again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people are comfortable that they can raise issues
without the fear of retaliation,'' said Blanch, a claim backed up
by the fact that Millstone now responds to more employee concerns
than any other nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
   But others feel that the old Millstone, and the old cozy
relationship with the NRC, is just below the surface. Ernest
Hadley, attorney for the employee whistleblower who hurt Millstone
managers the most, believes neither the company nor NRC officials
learned their lessons because no one was punished. Senior managers
for Northeast Utilities and the NRC escaped with honors, profit or
both, while a criminal investigation into a possible coverup of
violations by the US Attorney in Connecticut has languished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was held personally accountable. They can't fine these
people enough'' to make them change behavior, said Hadley, who is
based in Massachusetts. ``The way you hold people accountable is...
you send them to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   NRC officials, who found their credibility challenged as never
before in the wake of the Millstone scandal, counter that they have
taken unprecedented steps to make sure Millstone is safe. The
agency has spent more time at Millstone, measured in the hundreds
of thousands of hours, than anywhere else in the country, and fined
Northeast Utilities a record $2.1 million last December.
</P>
<P>
   Millstone officials say they have learned their lesson also,
fixing at least 20,000 problems at Millstone 3 alone, and
consistently choosing to delay the restart when faced with
difficulties. Now, they feel, the only thing to do is start the
reactor, expected to get NRC approval any day.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is far less rosy for Millstone 1, a 1970 vintage
reactor that provides a quarter of the 2,680 megawatts at
Millstone. Work on the reactor halted last year after a company
study showed a relatively small $70 million advantage to keeping
the reactor open. If a study next month is even more unfavorable,
as many expect, Northeast Utilities could decide to close the
reactor for good.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Utilities is bullish on Millstone 2, which managers
hope to restart by year's end. And the startup of Millstone 3 gives
the company much-needed income to reduce the $30 million that
Millstone's owners pay for replacement power.
</P>
<P>
   But the ultimate fate of the reactors at Millstone may have as
much to do with the competition as anything Millstone officials do.
Dozens of efficient facilities that burn natural gas have been
proposed for New England, based partly on the belief that the
owners can charge less for electricity than existing plants,
driving some of them out of business.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, construction began on a new gas plant in
Charlton, Mass., a project that owner PG&AMP;E Corporation called ``a
model... for the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But Northeast Utilities, unique among New England utilities,
will live or die by its nuclear plants. As the owner or part-owner
of five reactors, all of which would be hard to sell, Northeast has
little choice.
</P>
<P>
   Kenyon is aware of the challenges. ``It is not time to sit back
and rest on our laurels,'' he said. ``Our performance is solid
enough for restart, but we have not reached excellence and ...
that's where we need to be.''

IF ONLY CHINA LISTENED TO ZHAO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Those needing a metaphor for President Clinton's
travails in China have been obliged by a 78-year-old guy who could
have been more than a contender, and still has more guts than the
typical pols inflicted on citizens from both ends of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Zhao Ziyang was in public view as a big shot, he
was in tears, but he was also still the general secretary (as in
Big Enchilada) of the Chinese Communist Party. Zhao was in
Tiananmen Square on the evening of May 19, 1989, pleading with the
leaders of the young democracy demonstrators (whose cause he had
both cynically and genuinely championed) to declare victory and go
home. He failed, lost his power, lost his effort to avoid martial
law, and lost in his attempt to prevent the horror and outrage that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   Even in impotence and house detention, however, Zhao has never
quite shut up, as was apparent last week when a letter he wrote his
former comrades in the Chinese leadership earlier this month
surfaced in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   What was remarkable about the letter was not the criticism of
his successors that was emphasized in news accounts. What was
remarkable was its confidence and its optimism as Zhao publicly
urged today's leaders to use an acknowledgement of the colossal sin
that Tiananmen represents to reap great benefits for China's
future, internally and externally.
</P>
<P>
   Follow his train of thought, keeping in mind that his intended
audience is mostly Chinese and that the letter was addressed to the
party's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
   This onetime economic modernizer and Deng Xiaoping underling
thinks Clinton's visit is a decided ``turn for the better'' in
Sino-US relations at the beginning of what he also thinks will be a
period of even more enormous scientific and economic progress in
China.
</P>
<P>
   In this exciting era, Zhao is without any doubt that additional
personal and political freedom is simply inevitable, or, as he put
it, ``The trend of democracy cannot be blocked.''
</P>
<P>
   So, if it's inevitable, if it's also in China's interest, what
is the point, Zhao wonders, about clinging to an official version
of the mass killing that began on June 4, 1989, that is wrong,
known to be wrong by the people, a blot on China's international
image, and an obstacle to its future progress? Or, as he wrote last
month:
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past the Communist Party of China has rectified many
historical mistakes. Now we are facing the arrival of a new, open,
democratic, and information-age era. What reason do we have to
reject the will of the people, cling to the June 4 problem, and
block our road to democratic politics?
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't drag June 4 into the next century to resolve. The time
is ripe now to resolve the problem. We should give it a fair
appraisal. We should not carry a historical burden into the next
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more to the point, Zhao argued that expiation in the form
of reversing the official line about Tiananmen, namely that it was
a proper response to a ``counter-revolutionary'' threat, would
``bring 100 benefits and no harm'' and get rid of most of the
``factors'' abroad that are ``restricting China economically,
politically and culturally.''
</P>
<P>
   One clue that he is right can be found anytime Chinese
officials, big-shot or little-shot, are asked about the massacre.
They go on auto-pilot, the official line being that the verdict was
correct and is reaffirmed in party and government gatherings all
the time. They simply cannot handle the followup: If the verdict is
so solid, how come it keeps coming up?
</P>
<P>
   This suggests two courses of action for now. One, recommended by
smart dissidents, is that Americans from Clinton on down make sure
they tell the Chinese how they feel about the massacre. What is
requested is not mindless confrontation but skillful
identification.
</P>
<P>
   The other is for Clinton and other top officials to make sure
they inquire about Zhao's health, with obvious implications. My
guess is the Chinese will be anxious to assuage any concern.
</P>
<P>
   After all, before Zhao, the party boss was a guy named Hu
Yaobang, another economic modernizer with democratic tendencies who
got bounced when Deng Xiaoping yanked the leash.
</P>
<P>
   In April of 1989, Hu died. As the news was released, some young
people gathered to pay tribute to him and to his progressive ideas
_ in a corner of Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   We all know what happened next.

GRIEVING PARENTS FAULT PRODUCT RECALL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, Linda Ginzel and Boaz Keysar thought it was a freak
accident last month when a portable crib at their toddler's
day-care center snapped shut and killed their son.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, however, the couple from Chicago discovered his
death fit a pattern. The crib, called Playskool Travel-Lite and
made by Kolcraft Inc., had been recalled by the government and the
company five years ago after three children had died in the units.
And since the 1993 recall, two more children, including Daniel
Keysar, died in the cribs.
</P>
<P>
   As the couple endures the loss of their 17-month-old child, whom
they described as ``a pudgy, happy little bundle of enormous
potential,'' the boy's death raises questions about the
effectiveness of the nation's recall process.
</P>
<P>
   Do the government and manufacturers act swiftly enough to
identify dangerous objects? And when they do, is enough done to get
the word out about recalls?
</P>
<P>
   The couple said the recall system failed them, as they and their
day-care provider had no idea that the portable crib used by their
son was defective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an effective system,'' said Keysar, 40, a psychology
professor at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Kolcraft and federal officials insist that they acted
responsibly during the 1993 recall of the Playskool Travel-Lite
crib, spreading the word through press releases and notifying
pediatrician and childrens' groups.
</P>
<P>
   But there is tangible evidence their efforts fell short.
According to Kolcraft's own attorney, Charles Risch of Chicago,
just 3,500 of the 11,000 defective cribs (model numbers 77101 and
77103 sold between 1990 and 1992) have been returned.
</P>
<P>
   With only a 30 percent return rate on such a dangerous crib,
Keysar said the company should have stepped up efforts to get more
of them back. Aggressive recall campaigns often include bounties,
such as double your money back, or company-paid ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company should spend at least as much money to retrieve
these cribs as they spend marketing them,'' Keysar said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say all of the youngsters were killed in a
similar manner: The upper horizontal railings, which should remain
taut while the crib is in use, suddenly collapse into a V-shape
because of a faulty locking device at the center of the railing. A
child's neck gets trapped at the bottom of the V-shaped bars,
causing suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who also have a 5-year-old son, have filed a lawsuit
against the crib maker, but do not blame the family day- care
center, Sweet Tots in Chicago, in their son's death, said their
attorney, Steve Senderowitz. The center had apparently received the
crib as a hand-me-down gift.
</P>
<P>
   Ginzel, 39, who is also a university professor, pointed out that
in the last several years, Evenflo, Century, Draco, and Baby Trend
have joined Kolcraft in recalling 1.5 million portable cribs or
playpens of different models. Federal officials said 12 children
have died from collapsed playpens and cribs.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Schoem, director of recall and compliance for the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission, defended the agency's work in
identifying hazardous products, saying that about 300 products are
recalled a year. He said the average recall prompts a return rate
of about 30 percent. He said some big-ticket items, such as cars
and refrigerators, have return rates of 90 percent, perhaps because
more money is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   He said immediate action was taken in 1993 when regulators
identified a problem with Kolcraft's Playskool model, and the
government required the company to play a major role in spreading
the word about the defects. Kolcraft offered a full refund for all
returned cribs.
</P>
<P>
   If there is blame about lack of publicity of recalls on these
cribs and other products, Schoem places some with the media for
failing to devote enough space or air time to recall information.
In contrast, he said, ``Newspapers almost on a daily basis run
lottery results.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid future tragedies, commission officials point out that
parents should be careful when receiving hand-me-down products,
which may have been recalled without them knowing it. (For
information on these cribs and other recalls, check the
commission's Web site at www.cpsc.gov or call its hotline at
1-800-638-2772.)
</P>
<P>
   The commission also urges parents to fill out registration cards
when they make the original purchase. These cards help the
manufacturer contact owners when a problem arises. No such card was
made available in the Playskool Travel-Lite crib.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Keysar and Ginzel have started a nonprofit group to
warn parents about dangerous products for juveniles. The group has
its own Web site (www.kidsindanger.org). Keysar and Ginzel are also
pursuing a wrongful-death suit against the company. State
authorities in Illinois have yet to complete an investigation of
the day-care center, a routine move when a death occurs at a
licensed facility.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois officials are giving all licensed day-care centers a
copy of the portable crib recall lists. At the Massachusetts Office
of Child Care Services, which licenses day-care centers here,
spokesman Doug Pizzi said all centers will be given a list of the
recalled cribs.
</P>
<P>
   Ginzel said more information has to be made available about such
products. Many parents have called her saying they were ignorant
about the hazards of foldup cribs, even though they are widely
used. ``Everyone always says, `We had no idea.'''

</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T may be trying to turn around its reputation for giving out
wrong numbers, but Sue Marsh says it has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh, executive director for the Massachusetts Coalition for
the Homeless, said she is being driven mad by AT&AMP;T operators who
keep giving out the coalition's phone number to people seeking
numbers for other Massachusetts groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, she said she has gotten from two to five
phone calls a day intended for groups ranging from Massachusetts
General Hospital to Massachusetts Electric. When she called to
complain, she said an AT&AMP;T representative explained that some
overworked operators hear a request for an organization beginning
with the word ``Massachusetts,'' and simply give the number of one
of the first Massachusetts groups on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said she was infuriated when the AT&AMP;T worker suggested, as
a possible solution to this problem, that she might want to get the
coalition's number unlisted. ``AT&AMP;T is asking the victim to be
taken out of directory assistance!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Robin Sayre said she has yet to hear of a case
when so many wrong numbers went to one group. While she is
convinced the coalition's experience is an isolated case, perhaps
an odd linking of random mistakes, she has sent a message to all
directory assistance oeprators to ``probe carefully'' when asked
for a listing beginning with the word, ``Massachusetts,'' and pay
close attention when giving out the coalition's number.

leads him into crude underlinings and italicizings that wrench the
comedy of revenge. Elisabeth Shue's appropriately vulgar burlesque
queen, breaking the hearts of lechers, and McAnuff's mirroring of
the era's political upheaval in the world of the theater complement
Lange worthily, but little else does. (R)

THE BOOKS OF SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   An old friend and I have been having our annual argument about
what each of us will read this summer. A passionate but careful
reader, he is committed to Trollope; I rather sniffily countered
that I thought George Eliot would be a better bet. Late one evening
we were roaming around WordsWorth, where a spirited discussion was
taking place in the mystery aisles about Chinese culture. Like
Harvard Book Store, it is the kind of haven where one might gladly
be locked in overnight. My friend, grumpy at me for having messed
with his decision, clutched copies of both Eliot's ``Middlemarch''
and Trollope's ``Can You Forgive Her?''; I, stuck in the ``B''
section and the 20th century, grabbed a new edition of British
writer Pat Barker's brilliant novel of the First World War,
``Regeneration,'' and forced it upon him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, read this,'' I said, sure he would love the
fictionalized relationship between poet Siegfried Sassoon and his
wartime psychiatrist. My friend smiled politely, pretended to scan
the jacket copy, and put the novel back on the shelf. ``You know
me,'' he shrugged. ``I'm basically a drawing-room kind of guy.''
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, was drowning in war novels by the time I
was 11 or 12, happily immersed in ``Mila 18'' and ``The Naked and
the Dead'' in the basement of an air-conditioned Texas library.
What makes some of us gravitate to the elegant quiet of the drawing
room, others to the thrilling horror of the front lines, regardless
of gender or age or other telling traits of sensibility? I remember
taking solace during one August heat wave in Henry James's ``The
Portrait of a Lady,'' just on the heels of John le Carre's ``The
Little Drummer Girl''; I'm not at all sure the James made me a
better person, but I know it made me work a lot harder. One reader
will reach for Tolstoi every July; another insists upon nothing
more demanding than a Stephen King or John Grisham. All of us have
the same cross-genre goal: to leave behind the tragedettes and
self-delusions of our own lives for a time, and to find respite or
wisdom or comic relief in, God willing, an imaginary someone
else's.
</P>
<P>
   The Tolstoi of the summer of '98, according to some hyperbole,
is Richard Price's ``Freedomland''; the novel is neither that good
nor that wide, but it does deliver a story of dark intrigue _ the
search for a missing child _ with technicolor mega-realism. This
has been a heavy hitter's season for serious fiction, most notably
with Toni Morrison's exquisitely realized ``Paradise,'' her
incantatory vision of two colliding cultures _ an insular black
community and a women's retreat _ in a small Oklahoma town. Robert
Stone's ``Damascus Gate'' delivers Jerusalem in all its mad
splendor; the novel is vastly intelligent, but it's a tough
mountain trail, and newcomers to Stone might want to try the recent
reissues of his best novels: ``A Flag for Sunrise,'' ``Dog
Soldiers,'' or ``Outerbridge Reach.'' Cormac McCarthy finishes his
Border trilogy, set in a mythic, mid-century West, in ``Cities of
the Plain.'' The previous two volumes, ``All the Pretty Horses''
and ``The Crossing,'' are better: richer, deeper, more rhapsodic.
Writing from within the moral ambiguities of post-apartheid South
Africa, Nadine Gordimer takes on individual responsibility in a
violent society in ``The House Gun.'' And in ``My Heart Laid
Bare,'' Joyce Carol Oates, waxing overly Gothic as ever, traces the
threads of family mendacity and betrayal through two centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Frazier's grits 'n' gunpowder Civil War saga, ``Cold
Mountain,'' continues its nearly yearlong perch on the best-seller
lists, though I still contend that Ruby's Southern cooking is the
most compelling aspect of the novel. Russell Banks and Jane Smiley
took on the same historical era with similarly mixed results _
Banks's ``Cloud-splitter'' is a weighty fictionalized account of
John Brown's life, and Smiley's ``The All-True Travels and
Adventures of Lidie Newton'' is a picaresque abolitionist tale set
in antebellum Kansas. Anne Tyler produced another Mary Poppins
feel-good novel in ``The Patchwork Planet,'' while John Irving
continues his comic Dickensian chest-pounding with ``A Widow for
One Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickens figures in an even more direct way for Peter Carey, who
pays homage to ``Great Expectations'' in his deftly imagined ``Jack
Maggs.'' Such intellectual fiction has been enjoying a mini-revival
of late, kicked off last year with Thomas Pynchon's hefty ``Mason &AMP;
Dixon'' _ many have traveled there, but few have survived to tell
the whole tale. Recent spinoffs from that school of cerebrum-lit
include Australian writer Janette Turner Hospital's surrealistic
``Oyster,'' Maureen Howard's ``A Lover's Almanac,'' which is as
clever and au courant as dim sum, and Richard Powers's ``Gain'' _ a
daunting history of American commerce, which newcomers are advised
to put second to his previous novel, the brilliantly cyber-poetic
``Galatea 2.2.''
</P>
<P>
   Less showy but more emotionally rewarding are a few elegantly
literary novels from recent months _ particularly Irish writer
Colum McCann's ``This Side of Brightness,'' a resonant and deeply
moving story set in the subway tunnels of New York. Alice McDermott
provides a sweet melancholy with ``Charming Billy,'' which delivers
her central character by opening at his wake. In ``The Antelope
Wife,'' Louise Erdrich returns to her signature territory of Native
American myth and emotional legacy on the high Northern Plains.
Dorothy Allison fans will appreciate the easy-listening tone of her
rock 'n' roll novel, ``Cavedweller,'' which is hip and emotionally
candid, a long, old-fashioned story about going home. Jane
Hamilton, Oprah-ized for ``The Book of Ruth'' and appreciated for
``A Map of the World,'' has written a lovely novel in ``The Short
History of a Prince.'' Critic David Gates, who wowed a select band
of happy nihilists with his Holden Caulfield-like ``Jernigan,'' has
maintained that voice of ironic despair in ``Preston Falls.''
Another quiet victory of the season has been that of Ian McEwan,
whose hot-air-balloon send-off at the beginning of ``Enduring
Love'' transports readers in every way.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy analysands, limping through August while the docs are in
Truro, might want to draw succor from Daniel Menaker's ``The
Treatment'': You may be temporarily at sea, but at least you don't
have the demonic Dr. Morales for a shrink. An even wiser
contribution to the Art of Neurosis is Julie Hecht's sleeper story
collection from last year, ``Do the Windows Open?'' Laconic,
deadpan, and brilliantly charming, it's one of the funniest books
I've read in ages.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Two from 1997, now both in paper, were Don DeLillo's
``Underworld'' and Philip Roth's ``American Pastoral''; DeLillo's
vast and visionary epic looms like Idaho next to Roth's impeccably
structured Perfect Village. Arundhati Roy's gauzily sorrowful
novel, ``The God of Small Things,'' broke a lot of hearts in a
minor way last year; it's available in paper as well. A few other
books from 1997, well-received but half-neglected by the numbers,
deserve mention again: Rilla Askew's Faulknerian first novel, ``The
Mercy Seat,'' is a beautifully somber story about a family in the
19th-century West. Canadian poet Anne Michaels wrote a lovely ode
to prose in her story of a young Jewish refugee hiding during the
Second World War in ``Fugitive Pieces.'' And Francisco Goldman, in
his spooky, Conradian ``The Ordinary Seaman,'' took us aboard a
ghost ship in Brooklyn that never leaves port.
</P>
<P>
   Now on to the chips 'n' dips section, where pulp and whodunits
will take care of those tired brain cells that worked so hard all
year. The bimbette novel getting all kinds of press this summer,
much of it undeserved, is British former journalist Helen
Fieldings' ``Bridget Jones's Diary'' _ rhymes with Gidget, just
about as retro, but seems to be amusing Neanderbabes. Jacquelyn
Mitchard wrote a death-row love story in ``The Most Wanted,''
though her 1996 first novel, ``The Deep End of the Ocean,'' is much
better. Brad Meltzer, a lawyer who wowed bestseller lists last
summer with ``The Tenth Justice,'' has just turned out another
legal thriller about a husband-and-wife prosecutor-and-defense
pairing, ``Dead Even''; like his first novel, it's emotionally
clunky, but he's got the courtroom-suspense momentum down pat.
</P>
<P>
   In the mystery realm, P.D. James reigns supreme, as usual, with
last winter's ``A Certain Justice,'' which opens with a dead
barrister wearing a powdered wig. Her fellow Brit Martin Amis tried
to expand his repertoire by writing an existential whodunit,
``Mystery Train''; this little novel has left most literary readers
going ``huh?'' (shorthand for ``Why did I bother?''). More
rewarding and less pretentious is Carol O'Connell's spooky, awful
scare-novel, ``The Judas Child.'' On the local hero front: Susan
Conant, whose Alaskan malamutes save the day in her canine capers,
has added to her dog-friendly mystery series with ``The Barker
Street Regulars''; due any day from the presidentially adored
Dennis Lehane (Clinton read him on the Vineyard, of course) is the
Bean-town P.I. mystery ``Gone, Baby, Gone.''
</P>
<P>
   And leave us not forget the old standbys, who are to the bookish
in summer as essential as peach pie: Graham Greene, Edith Wharton,
E.M. Forster, Evelyn Waugh, Dickens, naturally, and, oh, maybe
Anthony Powell. (Woolf? Eliot? No, Trollope, dammit, Trollope!)
</P>
<P>
   If you find something magnificent, let me know.

BEN AFFLECK'S NEXT FRONTIER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The craziness started, of course, right after this
year's Oscars. The parties and hugs and goodbyes didn't stop until
the night after Ben Affleck and Matt Damon raised the Oscarcast
energy level with their exuberance at being named
best-original-screenplay winners for ``Good Will Hunting.'' Then
Affleck and Damon climbed on a red-eye for Pittsburgh to shoot
their next movie, ``Dogma,'' a religious satire by ``Chasing Amy''
filmmaker Kevin Smith. That's when the surrealism began in earnest,
Affleck says. ``The captain said, `Congratulations,' and the movie
on the plane was `Good Will Hunting,' and then we land and there
were hundreds of people at 6 in the morning at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how weird it is,'' Affleck continues,
stretching out in a suite in the kind of hotel that offers a view
of yachts bobbing in a marina. ``It was the first time we really
hung out together since the Academy Awards, and there were these
extras (for the film), and one lady was standing behind me and she
was like brushing up against me and she was like, `I'm touching
him, I'm touching him.' I thought, `This is insanity.' Then I
overheard Matt talking to someone who had walked up to him and
said, `God, I can't believe I'm talking to Matt Damon.' And I
thought, `You know, talking to Matt Damon used to be as pedestrian
as walking the dog. And now it's something people can't believe
they're doing.' But I guess it's the same process with anyone who
becomes famous.''
</P>
<P>
   At 25, Affleck knows he's up to his neck in paradox. At
precisely the moment when Hollywood stands ready to shove him into
a box labeled ``hunk'' or ``genius,'' he sees the danger of being
mythicized into something unreal. So he's playing the Hollywood
kind of Russian roulette young talent always has played, dancing
with the system, but also dancing away from it. That's why he made
``Dogma,'' in which he and Damon play fallen angels exiled to
Wisconsin, and ``200 Cigarettes,'' with Courtney Love, Paul Rudd,
and his brother, Casey. But he's here today to talk about his role
in ``Armageddon,'' the summer's gonzo action movie opening
Wednesday. In it, Affleck plays a trouble-shooter saving Earth from
a Texas-size asteroid, along with Bruce Willis, and providing the
love interest opposite Liv Tyler as Willis's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of rejoicing in taking the Hollywood plunge, Affleck is
a little worried about what he's getting into. ``It's a concern to
me, being cut off from real life,'' he says. ``I've seen it happen
to people's careers who I don't know really well, but I hear about
how their lives changed. You see their work and it becomes less and
less something you can relate to. It's less and less about real
life because you stop having real experiences to draw upon. It's a
real danger. In addition, it's a danger to your personality if
you're surrounded by people who just want to be around you for
sycophantic reasons or because they think it makes them look cool.
I realize in a poignant way that our world is only what's in our
immediate perception. And if that reality becomes corrupted, then
your perception of the world can be corrupted.''
</P>
<P>
   So Affleck has learned to soft-pedal exchanges like the one he
recently experienced at LA's Tower Records, when a guy came up to
him and told him, in effect, that the house where Affleck and Damon
and another roommate recently lived had become a Hollywood pop
shrine, on a par with the apartment where Quentin Tarantino wrote
``Pulp Fiction'' or the house where Sylvester Stallone wrote
``Rocky.'' A fabled site, in other words, where Hollywood lightning
struck and could rub off on other hopefuls if they stood there
soaking up success vibes.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, ``Armageddon'' producer Jerry
Bruckheimer says, ```Good Will Hunting' wasn't out, but we'd seen
`Chasing Amy,' and thought he was very interesting. We tested him
in my office. Every secretary and assistant wanted to know who he
was, which reaffirmed my thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Affleck is sensitive enough and idealistic enough to
worry about his friendship with Damon being commercialized into a
commodity. Besides, he says, it doesn't reflect the current
reality. ``It's such a weird thing that the very same time that our
friendship became so public, we never spent any time together
because we were so busy working on different pictures, except for
`Dogma.' Before we were successful, we lived together and hung out
together with a bunch of other guys from Cambridge. Now that we're
busy, I don't see him enough. That's one of the things that make it
hard to keep writing. We're working on a new script, but `working'
is the operative word, and to say that it's unfinished is an
understatement. Ironically, the success of the first project is
what makes it difficult to actually do the same thing again. I
thought the whole point of being successful is that you get the
opportunity to keep doing it. I didn't think it would be as much a
preventative device as an opportunistic one.''
</P>
<P>
   All Affleck is prepared to say about the upcoming script is that
it will be a romantic comedy. ``I love working with my friends, and
it's good to actually have this happen to both of us at once
because then we can bounce the strangeness of it off someone that
it's also happening to. But sometimes, I gotta tell ya, it's
mind-bendingly bizarre what we're turned into. There's maybe a
danger in being seen as a kind of Frick and Frack, Heckle and
Jeckle kind of thing. Which is why we went out and did separate
stuff. Matt did `Saving Private Ryan.' I went and did `Shakespeare
in Love.' Then we did `Dogma,' I did this one, now I'm going off to
do a romantic comedy, very commercial, called `Force of Nature,'
with Sandra Bullock. And Matt is doing `The Talented Mr. Ripley.'
There's no shortage of people who want us to make another movie
together. But you know what? It took five years to make `Good Will
Hunting' happen, and I'm pretty sure the next one will happen in
less than five years.''

<P>
   ``Shakespeare in Love,'' still filming in London with a script
by Tom Stoppard, didn't yield the usual tidbits to the tabloid
press, partly because, Affleck says, he and his girlfriend, Gwyneth
Paltrow, don't have any scenes together. ``Joseph Fiennes, Ralph's
brother, plays Shakespeare, Judi Dench plays Queen Elizabeth,
Geoffrey Rush plays the play's producer, and Gwyneth plays the
woman he falls in love with. She disguises herself as a boy in
order to act because women weren't allowed onstage in Shakespeare's
day. The story is about Shakespeare getting writer's block as he's
writing `Romeo and Juliet.' I play this big star and I'm like a
huge pain. I have this enormous ego and I'm very demanding, but
Shakespeare has to have me in the play in order to get it produced.
He doesn't want to cast me as the lead, so instead he casts me as
Mercutio, and when I ask him what the name of the play is, he
thinks a minute and says, `Uh, ``Mercutio,''' and I say, `Oh, OK.'
It's like `Bullets Over Broadway,' except that it's `Swords Over
Shakespeare.'''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck's mother, Chris Affleck, and Damon's mother, Nancy
Carlsson-Paige, are both educators who work in Cambridge. Affleck,
who bought his mother a car from his ``Good Will Hunting'' payday,
still feels weirded out from his last visit home when he slept on
the fold-out sofa in her apartment. ``It's been really incredible
to go home and be totally thrown out of context. The people in
South Boston were very hospitable, showed us a lot of details, like
how people in Southie wore their pants as opposed to the way they
wore them in (Boston's Dorchester neighborhood). I haven't been
back to South Boston since we shot the movie. I wonder what it
would be like to walk down the street now. I kind of want to go
back to the L Street Bar. I'm glad South Boston will now be known
for something besides the busing crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Cambridge, it's strange to be in places where you grew up
and you were always treated a certain way, like if you went to this
pizza place and they gave you a hard time. Now all of a sudden,
it's like the pizza's free and they want to take your picture and
put it on the wall. ... If we had any impact, I think it's because
Matt and I came across as guys, not, like, celebrities. ... I
didn't have a sense that we were the front-runners. I didn't dare
imagine it. When I heard my name, it was stunning and shocking and
overwhelming. I felt like dissociated from myself. It's like when
you get in a car accident and you feel you're watching yourself in
slow motion. It was that kind of feeling, but it was a good car
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   When he signed to do ``Armageddon,'' Affleck thought it would be
the movie that meant, for the first time, big exposure. ``But when
`Good Will Hunting,' came out and was so high-profile, it staved
off the questions of, like, who you are. At least going in I felt I
had some kind of credibility and didn't feel like a complete
impostor.'' Still, Affleck says, he initially stumbled over the
differences between this, his first big-budget production, and the
indepdendent films he had done. ``Coming from the `Star Wars'
generation, I always wanted to do one of these movies,'' Affleck
says, ``and I loved the chance of working with Billy Bob
(Thornton), Steve Buscemi, and Owen Wilson. ... Billy Bob is like
my hero, so rather than be obsequious about it, I had to try and
make fun of him. I would kid him about being a hillbilly with an IQ
of 30. But Billy Bob has a much crueler sense of humor than I do.
He got back at me by saying Matt and I were lovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was uncomfortable the first month and a half of the
shooting. We started in August, but Bruce (Willis) was still
filming `Mercury Rising' and couldn't show up until September. So
they did a lot with Peter Stormare (the Swedish actor plays a
Russian astronaut) and me on the Mir. We served essentially as the
guys on whom they tested the suits to see if they would be suitable
for movie-star wear, you know? Of course, they weren't, and they
had to make a bunch of modifications. Bruce was our leverage. We'd
say, `Bruce is going to go crazy if you keep it like this, so you
better fix it. We know you'll trot all over us, but Bruce will go
nuts.' Once he showed up, he was funny and self-deprecating and he
cared. Still, it was difficult for me to adjust. I felt intimidated
by the scope of the movie, and by the company I was keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, the director (Michael May) was involved with the
pictures, making it look great. But the good news was that he'd let
you do your thing. Once I figured out that I had to draw a little
more broadly to compete with the kind of histri-onics and cacophony
that were going on, it became easy. ... At first, I felt like a
reject from `Lost in Space.' It was only because I had the luxury
of a long shoot that I had the chance to make some adjustments and
eventually grew comfortable and relaxed a little bit and became
ultimately proud of my performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck laughs when asked if making a big studio film like
``Armageddon'' will cause him to be perceived as a sellout in
Cambridge. ``They already think we sold out with `Good Will
Hunting,''' he says. ``It can be very much the People's Republic. I
mean, Cambridge is a very interesting town with a lot of smart
people, but they don't necessarily understand exactly how this
particular business works. And it's a business like any other
business. You couldn't very well go into the shipping business
without dealing with UPS. I mean, big universities are corporate
entities. So ultimately, if you want to do some kind of
professional work, you end up in bed with large corporations. But
there's also a conservative kind of working-class sensibility in
Cambridge that doesn't say that you've gone and switched sides from
labor to capital.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck, who keeps his Oscar on a bookshelf in his one-bedroom
digs, says his mother's well-documented wariness of Hollywood has
lessened. ``If anything, she's probably more resigned to the fact
that it's just gonna sort of happen and she's gonna let me do it. I
think she's less worried that I'm gonna end up panhandling and
brokenhearted. I think her chief concern was that I would get swept
away by Hollywood. Failure in this business can be very crushing
and debilitating and that's her concern. It's a concern I would
have about my kids. But I guess she feels like even if it all goes
downhill, I would have achieved some modicum of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I enjoyed about the Oscars is that I was able to
share it with her. It wasn't just my experience or my and Matt's
experience. Bringing our moms made it seem more real.... She met a
lot of people out there, but, you know, my mom is not star-struck.
She's star-struck by political people or activists. She spent most
of her time saying, `You know, I thought he was kind of sleazy.'
And I said, `Well, guess what, Mom? They're all sleazy. You're not
visiting a monastery. You're visiting, you know, Sodom and
Gomorrah. This is, uh, the sleaze center of the universe.''

   ``This World, Then the Fireworks'' is lurid and over the top,
even by Jim Thompson's standard. Michael Oblowitz's film
enthusiastically embraces Thompson's perverse story of murder,
brutality, incest, whoring, and lies that the spiritual father of
pulp fiction couldn't get published in his lifetime, even in
Playboy. The result is a heavily stylized and thoroughly surreal
excursion that makes truer contact with the amoral darkness of
Thompson's metaphysical world than several more technically
accomplished films have. It also knows its way around noir (see if
you can winkle out the homage to Dashiell Hammett in the name of a
murder victim).
</P>
<P>
   The film's very disjointedness seems an integral part of the
chaotic world prowled by a feline, predatory brother and sister
team. Their lives were defined when they were children in 1926 and
their father blew the head off a cuckolded husband after a July 4
celebration and was sent to the electric chair for it, trigger
finger and all. Thirty years later, the older brother _ played by
Billy Zane with a rancid cool that convinces us he's just barely
keeping the lid on his demons _ flees Chicago, where he has done
too good a job as a reporter exposing police corruption, and joins
his sister and mother in a seedy California coastal town.
</P>
<P>
   He is not a welcome sight to his mother, played by Rue
McClanahan with a whiny aspiration toward the respectability that
has so far eluded them. McClanahan's baleful look when he goes
upstairs to reunite with his sister says all that's needed. Gina
Gershon, continuing to inch her way back to credibility after
``Showgirls,'' delivers the film's most complex performance as a
tough survivor who has terrorized the local mob into allowing her
to operate as an independent prostitute, yet who also lives at home
and believes in family values, insofar as she can.
</P>
<P>
   The proof of the expertness with which the film threads its way
through Thompson's hellish parody of American values is that, by
the end, the incestuous brother-sister scam team turns out to be
the most innocent in the film. This is despite Zane's
enthusiastically callous abuse of a repressed and masochistic
policewoman all too eager to become his sex slave, and whose beach
house he covets. Sheryl Lee's resourcefully layered performance as
the willing victim is her best in some time. The film is a bit too
stylistically self-conscious to fully hand itself over to the
lunacy in the writing, but never so much so that it fails to apply
an ironic fillip to its gruesomeness. ``This World, Then the
Fireworks'' rises to Thompson's kinky depths.

THE SECRETS OF LOREENA MCKENNITT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Loreena McKennitt's star has been gently rising in the new-age
and world-music fields for more than a decade, to the point where
her albums have been turning gold in America, signifying sales of
500,000 copies, and selling well in other parts of the world. The
Canadian singer-songwriter-harpist, comfortable with both ancient
tribal instruments and computers, built her audience by increments,
via public radio airplay, song placement in movies and television
shows, word-of-mouth, reviews _ ``brick by brick,'' as she often
puts it.
</P>
<P>
   The steady trajectory of her sales spiked upward earlier this
year when a remix of her lilting song ``The Mummers' Dance'' was
given a modern-rock dance pulse by England's Nick Batt under his
moniker DNA. (He previously had done something similar for Suzanne
Vega and ``Tom's Diner.'') McKennitt didn't know much about the
remix game but asked that it satisfy her ``creative needs ...
retain the idiomatic bits.'' The surprise hit did for her what
``Orinoco Flow (Sail Away)'' did for Enya years ago. It swept
people away. And it gave her a vast crossover audience, boosting
the song's album, ``The Book of Secrets,'' to the platinum level (1
million sales).
</P>
<P>
   Which caused two problems.
</P>
<P>
   She worried some people might feel ``burned'' by hearing ``The
Mummers' Dance'' remix on radio, only to buy the album and find the
original, non-beat-and-synthesizer-inflected song. ``It almost
appeared to some (people) that they were duplicitously lured into
buying the CD,'' she says, ``and for some people ... the other
music was not their culture and they didn't even get the version of
`The Mummers' Dance' they heard on the radio. It's an example where
the industry can be rather callous with the public. And I'm quite
concerned how the industry is treating the public these days.''
</P>
<P>
   The other problem was the need to tour more extensively than
planned. Speaking recently from her office in Stratford, Ontario,
McKennitt admits she's glad she's finally finished touring,
sighing, ``I just kind of tuckered myself out.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, ``The Mummers' Dance'' remix was released
commercially. At present, she is getting some rest, having a
semblance of a private life. ``It's starting, slowly,'' she says.
``What I call my private life means just being able to go to city
council meetings or go out to dinner with friends. Last week, I
went to a club in Toronto for the first time in three years. Last
night, I went to the theater for the first time in a year.''
</P>
<P>
   McKennitt, 41, works closely with her manager, and says they
sometimes disagree about the approach, the intensity, the balance
of work and downtime. Says the manager: ``She wants to do so many
things. Her mind never ceases. She has her own ideas and notions,
and, of course, she never accepts the conventional way of doing
things. I try to analyze when that's good and healthy and
appropriate and when it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Thing is, the manager is McKennitt. Yes, she answers, she does
drive herself crazy sometimes, sharing those two jobs. But wait,
there's more: McKennitt is also her own producer. She writes
detailed liner notes for her songs. (Somewhat ironically, in the
booklet accompanying ``The Book of Secrets'' she reveals many
secrets of her process.) She has two offices, one in Stratford near
her farmhouse home and one in London, and 12 full-time staffers.
The businesswoman part of her deals in ``budgets and timelines.''
</P>
<P>
   She's a musical anthropologist. When she does interviews in
countries where English is not the native language, she pays for a
translator. She thinks it's insulting to expect people in every
country to speak English. ``I just go, `The hell with it,''' says
McKennitt, which is about as profane as she gets, ``and spend my
own money and do it because it's proper.''
</P>
<P>
   What is she not? ``Some would say I'm a workaholic,'' McKennitt
says, ``and that can't be further from the truth. It doesn't take
me two seconds to change gear, and I'm always trying to find ways
of divesting myself of responsibility. But at the same time, I've
set a certain standard for myself and it does end up involving more
of my participation.''
</P>
<P>
   You can think of McKennitt as a Canadian Ani DiFranco, a prime
example of the DIY (do-it-yourself) mentality forged during the
early punk years and articulated by her pal Peter Gabriel in the
song ``D.I.Y.'' All of the work, of course, is done to better serve
the needs of the artist.
</P>
<P>
   The spectrum of today's pop music is as broad _ and as extreme _
as it's ever been. There's assaultive heavy metal, punk, and rap
out on one wing; the sort of music made by Enya, Brian Eno, Robert
Fripp, Dead Can Dance, and McKennitt out on another. This latter
style was pioneered by Fripp and Eno in the 1970s, but took hold in
a semi-commercial sense during the next decade with the music
recorded on England's 4 A.D. label, particularly that of the
Cocteau Twins and their spinoff This Mortal Coil.
</P>
<P>
   McKennitt creates gorgeous, ethereal, multi-layered musical
tapestries. She terms her style ``eclectic Celtic,'' for its Celtic
basis and its wide range of world-music influences: Middle Eastern,
Russian, music that sounds as if it sprang from the mystical Dark
Ages, music rooted in a time and place and yet beyond time and
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all pretty much created from my eclectic range of
interests and trying to re-articulate that within a music form,''
she says. ``Categorization is an unfortunate necessity that the
industry has gotten into for what I would like to think are the
most honorable reasons, to be helpful to the public. But it's been
taken far beyond a filing system _ nor does it reflect the
diversity or complexity of things going on. Even Celtic music, what
are we talking about? Is it the traditional repertoire or is it a
kind of music that is derivative of it? What about music with a
non-Celtic repertoire, but one with Celtic instruments? I think
what we're seeing _ and I would certainly put myself as a symptom
of it _ is that we're living in a time where affluence and
technology have allowed us to either physically travel or be
exposed to such a wide range of musical expressions, particularly
cultural or ethnic expressions.''
</P>
<P>
   Put another way: If you put Shane MacGowan &AMP; the Popes and
McKennitt in the same Celtic bin, you're talking about artists who
are worlds apart.
</P>
<P>
   McKennitt discusses music with a scholarly mien, as well as
considerable passion. But the woman who once hoped to be a
veterinarian and started her musical life as a folk singer never
graduated from high school. Rather, she has assumed control of her
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The music and vehicles of my career have afforded me the
opportunity to go around studying various subjects and geographical
places that I would have been interested in anyway,'' she says,
``and then have forged that into a kind of personal document.'' Her
songs, she adds, feel to her like fictionalized travel writing,
which allows fans ``to vicariously plug in through this prism of
their own perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``The Book of Secrets,'' her journeys _ literally or
figuratively _ took her to Greece, Turkey, Italy, Siberia, England,
and, as always, to Ireland. She's used words by Tennyson and Yeats
and fashioned songs for them. On this latest album, she was
inspired by the writings of a sixth-century monk, by Alfred Noyes,
by Sufism, by Dante's ``The Divine Comedy.'' She integrates the
modern and the ancient.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I feel like I'm a Luddite,'' McKennitt says, ``I'm
not frightened of the technology, but want to learn enough about it
to use it with discretion. I've always found synthesizers very cold
and crude, but at the same time if they're treated in a particular
way, blended, they're actually rather invisible, supporting other
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Like David Byrne, Paul Simon, and Peter Gabriel, she considers
it her joy and duty to explore other cultures. When she travels,
she keeps binders, recording what she hears and feels. It's to her
credit that there are few accusations of cultural larceny; she
makes the world's music her own. ``You're always to some degree an
outsider,'' she says, ``and there's danger in that because your
perceptions might be awry.''
</P>
<P>
   If McKennitt's music has a soothing, calming effect, she
understands. Still, she notes, the intent is more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music can be complex or it can be simple in its architecture,
its intent, its message, its personality, and its
characteristics,'' she says. ``I think that it's great music is so
versatile, there are so many forms, causes, so many feelings, and I
find it very interesting in the broader subject of the
psychological impact of sound ... similar to the psychology of
color. In that way, I can see there are many aspects to my music _
or more than one character _ but one of the characters I recognize
is that there are many poeple who find it soothing; (it works) for
those who are looking for the music to function and support their
mood in that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel there is a lot more than just providing a soothing
sound environment, which I feel is the primary mandate of new-age
music. It's not to provoke; it's not to disturb; it is there to
provide a pleasant environment that is not intrusive. I think there
is a place in the world for that kind of music and that kind of
sound. Where I get a bit concerned is having my music reduced to
just that function because there is a lot more going on in terms of
the subject matter and even the arrangement. It's not
(itals)necessarily(unitals) designed to be soothing. When I go into
the studio, it's not like: ``Oh, what can I play to be the most
soothing?'''

GRIEVING PARENTS FAULT PRODUCT RECALL SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL AND PATRICIA WEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At first, Linda Ginzel and Boaz Keysar thought it was a freak
accident last month when a portable crib at their toddler's
day-care center snapped shut and killed their son.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, however, the couple from Chicago discovered his
death fit a pattern. The crib, called Playskool Travel-Lite and
made by Kolcraft Inc., had been recalled by the government and the
company five years ago after three children had died in the units.
And since the 1993 recall, two more children, including Daniel
Keysar, died in the cribs.
</P>
<P>
   As the couple endures the loss of their 17-month-old child, whom
they described as ``a pudgy, happy little bundle of enormous
potential,'' the boy's death raises questions about the
effectiveness of the nation's recall process.
</P>
<P>
   Do the government and manufacturers act swiftly enough to
identify dangerous objects? And when they do, is enough done to get
the word out about recalls?
</P>
<P>
   The couple said the recall system failed them, as they and their
day-care provider had no idea that the portable crib used by their
son was defective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an effective system,'' said Keysar, 40, a psychology
professor at the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Kolcraft and federal officials insist that they acted
responsibly during the 1993 recall of the Playskool Travel-Lite
crib, spreading the word through press releases and notifying
pediatrician and childrens' groups.
</P>
<P>
   But there is tangible evidence their efforts fell short.
According to Kolcraft's own attorney, Charles Risch of Chicago,
just 3,500 of the 11,000 defective cribs (model numbers 77101 and
77103 sold between 1990 and 1992) have been returned.
</P>
<P>
   With only a 30 percent return rate on such a dangerous crib,
Keysar said the company should have stepped up efforts to get more
of them back. Aggressive recall campaigns often include bounties,
such as double your money back, or company-paid ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company should spend at least as much money to retrieve
these cribs as they spend marketing them,'' Keysar said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials say all of the youngsters were killed in a
similar manner: The upper horizontal railings, which should remain
taut while the crib is in use, suddenly collapse into a V-shape
because of a faulty locking device at the center of the railing. A
child's neck gets trapped at the bottom of the V-shaped bars,
causing suffocation.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who also have a 5-year-old son, have filed a lawsuit
against the crib maker, but do not blame the family day- care
center, Sweet Tots in Chicago, in their son's death, said their
attorney, Steve Senderowitz. The center had apparently received the
crib as a hand-me-down gift.
</P>
<P>
   Ginzel, 39, who is also a university professor, pointed out that
in the last several years, Evenflo, Century, Draco, and Baby Trend
have joined Kolcraft in recalling 1.5 million portable cribs or
playpens of different models. Federal officials said 12 children
have died from collapsed playpens and cribs.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Schoem, director of recall and compliance for the US
Consumer Product Safety Commission, defended the agency's work in
identifying hazardous products, saying that about 300 products are
recalled a year. He said the average recall prompts a return rate
of about 30 percent. He said some big-ticket items, such as cars
and refrigerators, have return rates of 90 percent, perhaps because
more money is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   He said immediate action was taken in 1993 when regulators
identified a problem with Kolcraft's Playskool model, and the
government required the company to play a major role in spreading
the word about the defects. Kolcraft offered a full refund for all
returned cribs.
</P>
<P>
   If there is blame about lack of publicity of recalls on these
cribs and other products, Schoem places some with the media for
failing to devote enough space or air time to recall information.
In contrast, he said, ``Newspapers almost on a daily basis run
lottery results.''
</P>
<P>
   To avoid future tragedies, commission officials point out that
parents should be careful when receiving hand-me-down products,
which may have been recalled without them knowing it. (For
information on these cribs and other recalls, check the
commission's Web site at www.cpsc.gov or call its hotline at
1-800-638-2772.)
</P>
<P>
   The commission also urges parents to fill out registration cards
when they make the original purchase. These cards help the
manufacturer contact owners when a problem arises. No such card was
made available in the Playskool Travel-Lite crib.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Keysar and Ginzel have started a nonprofit group to
warn parents about dangerous products for juveniles. The group has
its own Web site (www.kidsindanger.org). Keysar and Ginzel are also
pursuing a wrongful-death suit against the company. State
authorities in Illinois have yet to complete an investigation of
the day-care center, a routine move when a death occurs at a
licensed facility.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois officials are giving all licensed day-care centers a
copy of the portable crib recall lists. At the Massachusetts Office
of Child Care Services, which licenses day-care centers here,
spokesman Doug Pizzi said all centers will be given a list of the
recalled cribs.
</P>
<P>
   Ginzel said more information has to be made available about such
products. Many parents have called her saying they were ignorant
about the hazards of foldup cribs, even though they are widely
used. ``Everyone always says, `We had no idea.'''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
AT&AMP;T misdelivers
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T may be trying to turn around its reputation for giving out
wrong numbers, but Sue Marsh says it has a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh, executive director for the Massachusetts Coalition for
the Homeless, said she is being driven mad by AT&AMP;T operators who
keep giving out the coalition's phone number to people seeking
numbers for other Massachusetts groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, she said she has gotten from two to five
phone calls a day intended for groups ranging from Massachusetts
General Hospital to Massachusetts Electric. When she called to
complain, she said an AT&AMP;T representative explained that some
overworked operators hear a request for an organization beginning
with the word ``Massachusetts,'' and simply give the number of one
of the first Massachusetts groups on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Marsh said she was infuriated when the AT&AMP;T worker suggested, as
a possible solution to this problem, that she might want to get the
coalition's number unlisted. ``AT&AMP;T is asking the victim to be
taken out of directory assistance!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Robin Sayre said she has yet to hear of a case
when so many wrong numbers went to one group. While she is
convinced the coalition's experience is an isolated case, perhaps
an odd linking of random mistakes, she has sent a message to all
directory assistance oeprators to ``probe carefully'' when asked
for a listing beginning with the word, ``Massachusetts,'' and pay
close attention when giving out the coalition's number.

GOING WRONG GOES RIGHT FOR PETER MCDONALD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``I Went Down,'' Peter McDonald plays a brooding introvert
who, in his own way, is eloquently inarticulate. Just released from
a Dublin prison for an unidentified petty crime, he finds himself
enmeshed in a group of low-life gangsters, setting off on a crazy
mission with a thug who fashions himself as an Irish John Wayne but
is really just another two-bit bungler. Throughout this wild
misadventure, McDonald walks tentatively and stares sullenly, but
beneath the steady, silent gaze of his emerald eyes, it's clear his
mind is always working, the brain muscles cranking complex thoughts
the character can't manage to express.
</P>
<P>
   When things go wrong, all he can manage to spit out is a certain
four-letter word that, in working-class Dublinese, almost rhymes
with ``talk.'' He says it a lot because things go wrong a lot. The
situation is hilariously absurd, but not to McDonald's character:
He's deadly serious, and that's why it's so funny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing goes smoothly for these two guys,'' says McDonald, a
26-year-old Dublin native making his film debut in the independent
feature. ``They can't open doors. They can't steal a proper car.
They don't really know how to work guns. They make noise when they
shouldn't make noise. They always get it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But everything seems to be going right for McDonald, who is
poised at the beginning of what has the potential to be a brilliant
career. Just four years ago, he was a student acting in the Drama
Society at University College Dublin, and until he was cast as Git
in ``I Went Down,'' he was performing in &QC; 
pubs with Fly By Night Productions, a theater company he started
with several college mates including playwright Conor McPherson.
The only thing fly-by-night about the troupe, however, is its name.
McPherson, who wrote the screenplay for ``I Went Down,'' will make
his Broadway debut this year with his acclaimed play, ``The Weir.''
Another company member is now an assistant director at Dublin's
Abbey Theatre. McDonald is signed up for other films, including the
screen version of McPherson's play ``The Lime Tree Bower.''
</P>
<P>
   There's something refreshing about the actor at this incipient
stage: He exudes a natural confidence that isn't cocky. He's hardly
the reticent naif he plays on screen; he chats easily, with calm
self-assurance and unaffected warmth. But this is also a man who is
all too conscious that marketing is part of the business, and
marketing he does on a recent visit to Boston. And he does it well.
The award-winning independent film opens Wednesday, and it's
literally up against the end of the world, as in ``Armageddon,''
the big-bang flick with the big-bucks marketing budget.
</P>
<P>
   ```Armageddon' has so much screen space and such overpowering
marketing that people are going to see it,'' McDonald says. ``We're
going out with 100 prints or something for starters, and it's our
job to let people know that if they come to see it, they're going
to have a good time. It mixes art house and entertainment, that's
the point we're trying to make.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I Went Down,'' which was shot in 35 days on a budget just
under $3 million, has a wacky sensibility; it crosses genres faster
than you can cross a Boston street. It's part Western, part buddy
film, part gangster flick, part adventure story. McDonald's
onscreen cohort, played by Brendan Gleeson, is a gangster-wannabe
who reads cowboy novels and munches chocolates while he should be
paying attention to the task at hand. The two characters bicker
constantly over trivial issues, but their bond solidifies
organically.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald says the relationship grew out of a deadly-serious
approach to acting. ``We didn't corpse while we were on the set,''
he says, explaining that ``to corpse'' means to make each other
crack up. ``We knew that we had to play it totally straight,
because if we were trying to achieve comic performances, it would
go over the top and backfire. These characters are oblivious to the
fact that any of this might be funny. They straddle seriousness and
situation comedy just naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   The film attempts to do that, too, at every step of the game. It
is broken up by subtitles out of an old melodrama; it opens with a
quote from Plato's ``Republic'' that includes the title phrase ``I
Went Down,'' which has multiple meanings here. McDonald's character
``went down'' _ that is, he went to prison for a crime he didn't
commit. But in the end, Plato's lofty reference fades to a lewd
joke, based on the more vernacular meaning of the term. ``At the
end of this rough-and-tumble journey, the title is taken to a
different place, if you know what I mean,'' McDonald explains. We
know what he means.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's own journey has been the storybook actor's tale.
Growing up in Dublin, he made his stage debut as one of the Three
Kings in a Nativity play; he always felt the urge to act, and it
became stronger when he went to college. His mother, Brenda
Costigan, is a ``cookery writer'' for an Irish newspaper _ ``I do
try to get home on a Sunday'' for the traditional family meal, he
says. His father, Richard McDonald, had a business selling baler
twine and rope. &UR;  &LR; There were no actors in his immediate family,
although he has an auntie-in-law who is a performer.
</P>
<P>
   He came of age at a time when Ireland was experiencing economic
prosperity for the first time in decades; the old, repressed ways
of the past were fading, especially in the cosmopolitan centers.
``There was a sense of opportunity and more confidence in the
country,'' he says. ``It was a good time to grow up in Dublin.''
</P>
<P>
   His generation was weaned on American film and television, and
there is nothing tweedy or quaint about McDonald and his fellow
filmmakers. ``I Went Down,'' McDonald says, consciously avoids all
the cliches associated with Oirish films. It's not about Catholic
guilt; it's not about the Troubles; and there's not a saintly Irish
mother or a priest in the plot. Plus, it's shot in the flat peat
bogs of the Midlands: Director Paddy Breathnach deliberately didn't
trot cast and crew out to Yeats territory, with all those gorgeous
yet familiar scenes of rolling green pastures shot in the Celtic
twilight. ``The middle of our country is a great location, but no
one films there,'' McDonald says. ``One day we shot and the sun was
streaming through, and the peat almost looked red; it looked like
Arizona. We went back another day and got clouds, and it looked
like the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   McDonald himself is more influenced by the call of America,
though, than the pull of the moon. Like many of his fellow young
citizens, he spent four months in San Francisco on what's called a
J-1 visa, which allows Irish students to come to the United States
to work, have a grand old time, and sometimes camp out with
long-lost cousins. He traveled a bit while he was living here and
has a particular affinity for the American South. He's proud of his
ability to put on an American accent: ``It all depends on where you
wanna go, girl,'' he says, demonstrating a twangy voice that is
part Bill Clinton, part Jed Clampett.
</P>
<P>
   But his tastes run more to independent art films than to
situation comedies. He admires films like Steve Buscemi's ``Trees
Lounge,'' Stanley Tucci's ``Big Night,'' and Alan Taylor's
``Palookaville.'' He lists the Coen brothers and Ang Lee as his
favorite filmmakers. But during this marketing tour, he'd prefer to
remain on the qt about one Quentin Tarantino; he flinches at any
attempt to compare ``I Went Down'' with ``Pulp Fiction,'' even
though they both explore the buddy relationships of quarrelsome
hired guns. ``I think Tarantino is very good, but we're very
conscious that this film is not associated with his name,''
McDonald says politely. ``I don't think it's a reference point.
Ta-rantino puts genre characters in front of you, whereas in `I
Went Down,' the characters only think of themselves as genre
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reference points, the statistics are already
impressive. ``I Went Down'' is the highest-grossing independent
Irish film in history, and it won four awards at the 1997 San
Sebastian Film Festival. McDonald is hoping for similar acclaim
here, but that's not to say he's salivating at the chance for Matt
Damon-esque fame. ``I'm not in it to become a star,'' he says.
``I'm well aware that I could become ...'' He pauses, briefly.
``I'm well aware that I've achieved a certain amount of fame at
home, and that's one of the prices you pay to have clout as an
actor. The more people see your work, the more people will want to
see it again. But if you're going around acting like you're some
new big thing, it will come back to you. Plus, I haven't felt any
serious sense of fame at all. People don't bother you much in
Dublin,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, he hopes he can continue to straddle the worlds
of film and theater gracefully. A role on Broadway would be a good
thing, preferably in one of McPherson's plays. After all, in the
end of ``I Went Down,'' two of the characters do head off to the
States. ``It was a running joke on the set that if there is a
sequel, it would be called `And While You're Down There,''' he
says. ``We used to say that when (one of the characters) gets over
to America, he sets up a chipper _ you know, a fish and chip shop _
in New York or somewhere. And then some gangster comes in to try to
extort money and the whole adventure begins again.'' McDonald
laughs, heartily. Now that would be good fun. ``But,'' he adds,
``there's no talk of a sequel.'' Not yet.

CLOSE SHAVE: GILLETTE GEARS UP TO LAUNCH ITS FUTURISTIC RAZOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DOUG BLACKBURN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a friendly warning. We thought you might like to brace
yourself for what's to come: the Mach 3.
</P>
<P>
   We will be bombarded by an all-out media blitz for the new razor
in the weeks to come. It will be unavoidable, with images of Top
Gun-style fighter jets and their macho pilots pushing a product
that belongs in medicine chests.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, which is to razors what Bill Gates' Microsoft is to
computer software, has vowed to flood the marketplace with the Mach
3 beginning in July.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not give birth to the first three-blade razor
without some serious labor pains. Almost a billion dollars worth of
labor pains.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, the one that promises to be painful to anyone
with symptoms of TV commercial-intolerance, is the $300 million
advertising deluge that will be upon us throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Most men may not believe their shaving routine needs
fine-tuning. Every morning we shower and shave, if we shave at all,
without giving much thought to either activity.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are you're already using a Gillette product, most likely
the Sensor or Sensor Excel if you are given to permanent-handle
products.
</P>
<P>
   Even Benedetto Fusco, a barber in Schenectady, N.Y., since 1954
and a man who prefers the long-handled straight razor, admits to
using a Gillette at home. Why? Because it's convenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in a hurry you don't want to use a straight
razor. You might take a piece of skin off if you do,'' Fusco said.
``With a Gillette you can go fast. You may have to go over lots of
areas two and three times, but you can go fast.'' Fusco figures he
belongs to the last of a breed, barbers who still offer
straight-edge razor shaves. There are fewer requests for them every
day, but Fusco doesn't think it's the $6 fee that makes men shy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has changed and the straight razor is like an
antique,'' he mused. ``We've got too many people in a hurry, too
many people who don't know what a really good shave is like.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as he's concerned, a good shave cannot be had with a twin
or triple-blade razor, not to mention a disposable product.
Observed Fusco, ``There's no comparison, none whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette, the company whose patented slogan is ``the best a man
can get,'' so dominates the wet-shave industry it's a surprise the
competition isn't crying foul.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Boston, Gillette reported $2.9 billion in blades and
razors sales for 1997, earning $1.2 billion profit on them. Schick,
with $739 million in sales last year, is No. 2 and not gaining
ground. Schick is a division of the Morris Plains, N.J.-based
Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
   In a fawning story about Gillette and the Mach 3 in the June 15
New Yorker, business writer James Surowiecki writes, ``shaving has
become perhaps the only business in the world where the most
popular product is also the best: Gillette is simultaneously the
Porsche and the General Motors of shaving.''
</P>
<P>
   If the company's predictions are on target, by the turn of the
century the high-tech Mach 3 (Gillette's design team was required
to watch ``Terminator 2'' to get the look just right) will be the
most popular razor in the country and Americans will be buying 1.2
billion Mach 3 blades a year.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of razors, as well as a lot of greenbacks, for a
blue-chip company.
</P>
<P>
   The Mach 3 is the result of seven years of research and
development, a product the company started working on almost as
soon as it introduced the Sensor in 1989. The Sensor, the first
razor with twin blades individually mounted on responsive springs
that continuously sense and automatically adjust to the face, and
its upgraded sister product, the Sensor Excel, are the most popular
razors in Gillette's history.
</P>
<P>
   But they failed to take blade technology to the next level,
employing the same twin-blade setup that the company debuted in
1971 with the Trac II. Then the R&AMP;D folks came up with a
three-blade concept employing a new substance called diamond-like
carbon, DLC.
</P>
<P>
   This new product comes with a new price, of course. The Mach 3
razor set will retail for approximately $6.50, with a four-pack of
replacement blades, or cartridges, setting you back another $6.50.
By comparison, a Sensor Excel costs $4.49 and 10 cartridges sell
for just under $10.
</P>
<P>
   Schick's top product, the Protector featuring a pivoting blade,
costs $5.39 and $5.99 for five refill blades.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the Mach 3 to truly dominate the men's shaving market, it
must also make inroads on the disposable blades. More than half the
people who use razors buy disposables, according to a Consumer
Reports study two years ago. Disposables, while less ecologically
sound, cost between 20 to 50 cents each, and there's no blade to
pop in when the razor gets dull.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette is a viable competitor with its Custom Plus and Good
News disposables, but Schick, Bic and even drugstore brands are
priced lower than Gillette's disposables.
</P>
<P>
   If quality influences choice, though, more men will be turning
to cartridge razors. The Consumer Reports survey, which measured
razors for closeness, cuts, drag (how easily the blade glides over
the skin) and ease of use, found that overall men thought cartridge
razors performed better than disposables, that they gave a closer
shave and were easier to use.
</P>
<P>
   And the top two rated razors? Gillette's Sensor Excel and
Sensor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the Mach 3 makes its debut, the Gillette
braintrust is busy trying to come up with the company's first new
razor of the next millennium.

Monday morning people were playing pool, tending fussy kids, buying

SAND HILL ROAD, THE NEW CORPORATE ADDRESS OF CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's a distinction that will make businesses
cringe and landlords rejoice. A portion of the San Francisco Bay
area has edged out New York City for having the most expensive
office space in the country, according to a new survey.
</P>
<P>
   The highest of the high-rent honors goes not to downtown San
Francisco, but to a half-mile strip of Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park
that has become the pricey capital of venture capital. The survey
quotes rents in that area reaching $70 per square foot, higher than
the most exclusive towers of Midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Venture capitalists ``all want to be within walking distance of
each other, and that little stretch of Sand Hill Road is where
you've got to be,'' said Richard Podos, vice president of New
York-based Equis Corp., the real estate services company that
conducted the research.
</P>
<P>
   New York City received the top spot in the previous two years of
the survey. Podos attributed Menlo Park's new ranking to the
booming high-technology industry and the desire of venture
capitalists to stick close together to be near Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the companies that occupy the estimated 600,000 square
feet of office space on Sand Hill Road include investment firm
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &AMP; Co.; Goldman Sachs; venture capitalists
VC Institutional Venture Partners; Kleiner Perkins Caufield and
Byers and Venture Law Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are ascribing a lot of prestige to that address,
and they're willing to pay for it,'' said Larry Hendrix, a senior
vice president in Equis' office in San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate officials were not surprised by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Peninsula has been the tightest office market in the
country, and it has been for the past couple of years,'' said Kurt
Houtkooper, a broker with Grubb &AMP; Ellis Commercial Real Estate in
San Francisco. ``(Venture capitalists) have the money to pay the
high rents.''
</P>
<P>
   While real estate experts say the buildings are fairly modest,
the cachet of the address has gained national attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the country, if you say you're on Sand Hill Road,
people know where you are, and they know what that means,'' said
Monica Finnegan, senior vice president and managing director of CB
Richard Ellis, a commercial real estate company in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Bay area, on average, is still considered more
affordable than New York City.
</P>
<P>
   According to Equis, 15 midtown Manhattan properties are going
for more than $60 per square foot, and eight of those are asking
more than $65.

FLINT STRIKE NOT A MATTER OF SIMPLE ISSUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Having spent the better part of a week with the
folks on the picket line in Flint, Mich., it comes as no surprise
to me that the strike against General Motors shows no signs of
ending.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the kind of dispute that can be settled by splitting
the difference. It isn't about money. It isn't about benefits. It's
a fight over big issues, issues like: Where do U.S. factory workers
fit in the global marketplace? Can U.S. companies stay competitive
and stay in the United States? Do companies have a moral obligation
to remain in company towns that they have helped create?
</P>
<P>
   As the birthplace of both GM and the United Auto Workers union,
Flint has been dealing with these issues for at least 20 years. But
the passage of time has only increased the desperation on both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   GM, which has eliminated about 44,000 jobs in the city, is still
struggling to cut costs and boost productivity. The workers, who
believe that they have done their share to help the company, feel
as vulnerable as ever. They are not trying to hold on to the past _
they are just trying to hold on to their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the strikes by 9,200 workers at two Flint parts
plants have idled nearly 150,000 other GM employees. The list of
innocent victims includes about 1,400 at the GM assembly plant in
Arlington, Texas, which needs parts from Flint to stay in business.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the striking workers are quick to concede that they have
to adapt to the new realities of global trade. Just as GM doesn't
make your father's Oldsmobile anymore, the UAW doesn't turn out
your father's assembly worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize that times have changed. We need to be
competitive,'' one 12-year plant veteran told me. ``It's a two-way
street.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone shares the we're-all-in-this-together
attitude. Every workplace has malcontents who have nothing but
complaints about the organization that pays their salary. Flint
worker Kim McKinnis suggested that GM executives should be
subjected to Nuremberg-type trials for ```crimes against the
American people.'' He said that free-traders in Washington should
be carried away in shackles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that sounds radical,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, well, maybe a little.
</P>
<P>
   Striker Chris Szafran showed up on the picket line wearing a
10-year-old T-shirt from a previous dispute with GM. ``I'm about to
develop an attitude,'' the shirt announced. ``Enough is enough.''
Szafran, who has worked at GM for 21 years, said he votes to strike
every chance he gets.
</P>
<P>
   But McKinnis and Szafran were the exceptions. The vast majority
of the workers I met realize that their future is inextricably
linked to GM's. They know that if GM can't compete, they won't have
jobs. At the same time, they fear that nothing they do will stop GM
from seeking cheaper workers in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an irrational fear. GM already operates nearly three
dozen foreign plants, and no one expects that trend to turn around
soon. In a vivid example of how little national borders matter in
the global marketplace, the Flint strikes have triggered more than
25,000 layoffs in Mexico. About 240 workers were sent home in
Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   The sad truth is, stopping the flow of jobs out of Flint may be
like trying to stop a tidal wave. A debilitating strike doesn't
help.

THINK CAREFULLY ABOUT CHINA, TRADE AND HUMAN RIGHTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The frantic haste of President Clinton's detractors to attack
everything he says or does is trivializing what ought to be a
serious discussion concerning our relations with China. The
suggestion that the American president has sneaked military secrets
to the communist nation in exchange for election-year contributions
is ridiculous, bordering on paranoid.
</P>
<P>
   And the insistence that Clinton should not set foot anywhere
near Tiananmen Square would be like a foreign president's shunning
a White House reception because it's adjacent to the Mall where
Army troops once clubbed and dispersed peaceful bonus marchers.
Such distractions obscure several consequential questions on which
a public dialogue ought to focus. Here are a few:
</P>
<P>
   What responsibilities do we have for domestic policies of
political leaders in countries with which we trade? Is
international trade principally a matter of commerce, undertaken
for financial return, or is it a means for conferring political
approval upon nations with which we feel an ideological affinity?
Is trade something we encourage for mutual economic benefit, or a
carrot to induce compliance by others with our political
principles?
</P>
<P>
   Some well-meaning people want Clinton to begin by giving China a
strong tongue-lashing to prove his own bona fides as a champion of
human rights. State Department spokesmen respond that constructive
engagement is more effective than lectures. They point to the
patient conversion of South Africa, once an international pariah
for its history of human-rights abuses. Several points need
mentioning in this regard.
</P>
<P>
   As ardently as we wish to bring others around to our way of
thinking on questions of individual rights, there is a realistic
limit to how swiftly we can influence fundamental change when it
runs contrary to entrenched traditions. China is the world's
largest nation, maybe the oldest; it is conscious of its power and
jealous of its sovereign prerogatives. From 1949 to 1973, it lived
within walls of self-imposed isolation, impenetrable as those
physical walls that its ancestors built in the third century B.C.
</P>
<P>
   China has been changing for the better _ not as fast as we'd
like, but faster than some Chinese find comfortable. Its official
attitude toward our country has improved greatly. Chinese leaders
acted responsibly to help ease the Asian financial crisis, and
recently to help calm nuclear passions in India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts think we rushed the Soviet Union into a too-quick
transition to free-market capitalism from a totally state-managed
economy. Mikhail Gorbachev argued for a more gradual
transformation, but tides of change swept swiftly over Russia, with
mixed results.
</P>
<P>
   These have included steep increases in prostitution and black
marketeering, as well as ruinous interest rates that stifle
individual enterprise in its crib and bleed the public treasury.
The six-month bond rate jumped to 72 percent this month. Markets
are freer, but it's an open question whether Russia is better off
financially.
</P>
<P>
   The principal purpose of a trade agreement is economic, not
political. Asked privately why Clinton would promote free trade
with China but not with Cuba, a White House spokesman answered
matter-of-factly, ``I can think of at least a billion reasons.''
Each is a potential customer. China could become the world's
biggest market. With one-fifth of the world's people, it makes
American exporters salivate at the prospect.
</P>
<P>
   But, obviously, people can't buy goods without money. The
average Chinese lives on cents, not dollars, a day. He'll be a
customer only when he has a job that pays him a living wage. In the
past, some investors in China have engaged prison labor through the
government. Others have sold goods on our markets made by Chinese
labor at daily wages as low as 50 cents. If Clinton's negotiators
approve trade of this type, they'll be selling out the American
working family.
</P>
<P>
   Among the cherished human rights is the right to a livable wage.
On that question, American interests are clearly at stake. The
quality of Clinton's statesmanship may be measured by the level at
which he draws the line against Asian goods produced by
destructively low wages.
</P>
<P>
   Another point concerning human rights is our own continuing need
to set an example. We are the self-professed light on the hill. Our
country began as a haven and refuge from persecution. Here, we
declared that all were created equal and endowed with inalienable
rights. We engraved the most basic of these rights into our
Constitution as its first 10 amendments before ratifying it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for 80 years thereafter, we tolerated slavery while
virtually exterminating American Indians. We experienced the Alien
and Sedition laws, the Ku Klux Klan, the arbitrary imprisonment of
American citizens solely because of their Japanese ancestry, and
the ignominious phenomenon of McCarthyism.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom is not free, or necessarily self-perpetuating. Its
premiums must be kept up-to-date. Our country, made up of fallible
human creatures, must continuously guard against temptations of
self-interest, unreasoning hysteria, self-righteousness, or
political ambitions that would lead us astray from the
constitutional liberties we publicly espouse.
</P>
<P>
   Prejudice is a powerful and pernicious vice, the more so when it
wears the clever disguise of patriotism or religion. We cannot
always rely solely upon elected officials to protect us from it.
However brave and enlightened, they're occasionally tempted to the
sin of silence when speaking out seems an instrument of political
suicide. If we love liberty, we must guard it zealously for the
most unattractive, unpopular minorities among us.

   SCIENCE-RELIGION (Undated) _ For most of the century people have
espoused the view that science and religion should be kept apart to
avoid the inevitable combustions. But to rational minds it has
always been troubling that there could be two opposing ways to
explain what is the same universe. Science and religion both spring
from the human obsession to find order in the world. But surely
there can be only one true explanation for reality: Life was either
created or it evolved. Prayer is either communication with God or a
psychological salve. The universe is either pervaded by spiritual
forces or ruled by nothing but physical laws. Now various groups
are seeking a resolution, including those involved in a recent
conference that provided a heavy religious bent. By George Johnson.

 &HT;    Commentary: Telling the stories one more time
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You could have called it a convention of storytellers. It
actually was my parents' 50th wedding anniversary party.
</P>
<P>
   I love hearing stories. I grews up on them. One of my favorite
pastimes as a young girl was to spend the night with my
grandmother, MeMe. As I snuggled into bed beside her, enveloped by
the heady aroma of Avon night cream, I'd beg her, ``MeMe, tell me
the story about the time you put Uncle Frank into the rain barrel
to bring his fever down ...'' ``Tell me about the time you walked
to school through the woods and a wolf chased you ...''
</P>
<P>
   MeMe was an ace storyteller. It was a trait she passed on to her
son, my father.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy is renowned for his storytelling. He's also renowned for
never letting the truth slow down a good yarn. As he often says,
``If I forget a fact or two, well, I just smooth right over it and
nobody knows.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows, and nobody cares. It's an art, and Dad has
perfected it.
</P>
<P>
   At my parents' anniversary party, the room was filled with their
cohorts and partners in jest from the last 50 years. Men with whom
Dad had been boyhood friends recalled childhood pranks,
coming-of-age stories, first loves and last loves.
</P>
<P>
   Laughter ricocheted off the walls of that room for a solid two
hours as stories were shared one more time. I would have given
anything to hear each one of them. Back-slapping and knee-slapping
were the order of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The stories were more than a remembrance of good times. They
were a testament to lives well-lived. These are people who had
great fun, did outrageous things, took chances. They had pulled
pranks, concocted elaborate jokes, waited patiently for the right
opportunity to good-naturedly sucker in a pal. They made memories
that lived through the decades.
</P>
<P>
   As I moved throughout that room at the party, I found myself
wondering, ``What stories will I remember at my 50th anniversary
party? How am I spending my days, and will any of them be worth
recalling after 50 years of marriage? Am I having fun? Am I
creating wonderful memories with friends and family and
neighbors?''
</P>
<P>
   My folks lived all those years in a rural community, which by
its nature pulled folks together. They worshiped in the same small
country church, went to the same PTA and 4-H gatherings, the same
elementary school Christmas plays, the same Saturday night VFW
dances.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of us live isolated lives in urban societies,
sequestered behind shut doors and windows in air-conditioned homes,
offices and schools. We pop out just long enough to pop into a car
and busily go on our way. Little time is allotted for lingering,
loitering or lounging _ and even less time, I fear, for making
memories. Or telling stories.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 people attended my parents' open house, and each
one came with a story or a recollection. Each one in some way had
been touched or enlivened by my parents and had come to pay respect
and to celebrate knowing them. As their daughter, I felt incredibly
blessed to see this outpouring of love for two people I hold so
dear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when we hot-wired the passenger seat of your '40 Ford
and gave the high school principal a good jolt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Old Duke, now there was a hunting dog _ always hunting for a
nice, quiet place to take a nap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember when we sprinkled black gunpowder into Old Man
Smith's pipe tobacco? He got a charge out of that one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember that fishing trip to Canada? We all slept in that
little camper in the middle of the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   While we were busily recording the memories of that anniversary
party on videotape, my parents were replaying memories recorded in
their minds and hearts. The stories of a lifetime. A wonderful
lifetime.
</P>

CHOOSE A NAME DROPPER OR A TICKET DODGER 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In the all-important race for Texas lieutenant
governor, it has become obvious that voters will have to choose
between a name dropper and a ticket dodger.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators who heard from both candidates at an
Austin conference last week surely must have noticed the difference
in approach between Republican Rick Perry and Democrat John Sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Perry mentioned Gov. George W. Bush's name three or four times
in his 20-minute speech, not-so-subtly reminding everyone that he
is a Republican eager _ as are other GOP nominees _ to cash in on
the governor's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week we were in Washington, D.C., with Gov. Bush. I had
the great honor for him to introduce me,'' Perry began.
</P>
<P>
   You get the idea, and, Perry hoped, so did his audience.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp, by contrast, avoided partisan references and never even
hinted at the name of the gubernatorial nominee at the top of the
Democratic slate.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats pooh-pooh polls showing Bush with as much as a
53-point lead over challenger Garry Mauro, and everyone knows the
chasm will narrow before election day.
</P>
<P>
   But a conservative-to-moderate Democrat like Sharp, who is still
competitive in what many expect to be a strong Republican year,
dares not wave the Democratic banner too boldly. Sharp has refused
to endorse Mauro or any other statewide Democratic candidate. He is
too busy running his own campaign, he says.
</P>
<P>
   This is a different year, Sharp senses, than when he won three
previous statewide elections for the Railroad Commission and state
comptroller as a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp and other Democrats blasted the recent Scripps Howard
Texas Poll, which not only showed a huge lead for Bush over Mauro
and leads for most other Republican statewide candidates but also
indicated Sharp's support for lieutenant governor among likely
voters had plunged 10 percentage points since March.
</P>
<P>
   The race between Sharp and Perry, according to the survey, is a
toss-up with about one-third of likely voters undecided. But the
poll leaves the strong impression that Sharp is slipping, a message
that could discourage would-be financial contributors.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the survey was flawed because Democrats were
underrepresented in the polling sample. It remains to be seen
whether that was a polling glitch or simply a sad (for the
Democrats) sign of the times. But the Sharp campaign drew
encouragement from another result of the same poll, which showed
the Democratic candidate leading Perry among independent voters, 30
percent to 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Independents, who accounted for 26 percent of the polling
sample, will decide the lieutenant governor's race, as they do most
statewide races. And according to the survey, 43 percent of them
were undecided between Sharp and Perry, the current state
agriculture commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to school administrators, Sharp called for the
state to spend part of its tobacco settlement money to build new
classrooms and the Legislature to find new ways to soften the blow
of the Robin Hood school finance law, issues close to home for most
school leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Perry advocated two of Bush's priorities, a greater emphasis on
teaching reading in the public schools and a pilot voucher program
that would let students in low performing schools transfer to other
public or private schools and use tax dollars for tuition.
</P>
<P>
   Bush strongly supports Perry and not just because Perry is the
Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp once considered challenging Bush for re-election, and 10
years ago he was Texas chairman of Democrat Michael Dukakis'
presidential campaign against the governor's father, then-Vice
President George Bush, and said a couple of tacky things about the
elder Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that the governor's father has starred at two Perry
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   As presiding officer of the Texas Senate, the lieutenant
governor has a major role in the state's lawmaking process.
</P>
<P>
   Should the younger Bush win re-election and then follow in his
father's footsteps and get promoted to the White House _ a race the
governor is expected to make in 2000 _ the Sharp-Perry race will
become even more important.
</P>
<P>
   The winner will become the next governor.
</P>
<P>
   Although Sharp is keeping his distance from his ticket leader,
he isn't abandoning the Democratic Party altogether. He has been
endorsed by key Democratic constituencies, including organized
labor and minority groups, and is hoping for Democrats' grassroots
support.
</P>
<P>
   And Sharp prominently features on campaign literature the name
of his honorary campaign chairman, the state's top elected Democrat
and current lieutenant governor, Bob Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, who isn't seeking re-election, is backing Sharp to
succeed him. But Bullock, in another signal of distress for the
Democrats, has endorsed Bush in the governor's race.

   WASHINGTON _ It wasn't just the country's exotic flavor _
Bangkok's snake farms or elephant riding in Chiang Mai _ that
attracted Eric Pipkorn to Thailand. It was also the price.
</P>
<P>
   Pipkorn, of Atlanta, snatched up a package deal that included
roundtrip airfare, hotel costs and a day trip to Laos. The cost for
the weeklong trip? Just over $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw the package, we decided to go,'' said Pipkorn, who
went with his wife to the southeast Asian country last month.
``Normally, it costs that much just to fly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocked by a debilitating financial crisis that has plagued the
region since last fall, travel and booking agents on both sides of
the Pacific Ocean are scrambling to attract U.S. travelers by
slashing prices on airfares, hotel rooms and tour packages to just
about anywhere in southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in two more recent , yet memorable events _ a bloody
uprising that led to the downfall of Indonesia President Suharto
and a thermonuclear tit-for-tat between India and Pakistan _ and
some of these agents sound downright desperate as they look to U.S.
travelers to rejuvenate hurting Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, contrary to some earlier forecasts that the region
would have rebounded by now, currencies continue to lose value.
Since mid-June of last year, for example, the Thai baht has lost 72
percent of its value against the dollar. The Philippine peso and
Malaysian ringgit are down 55 percent and 57 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   What started with the collapse of the Thai baht last summer has
spread to other Asian countries ``like the flu,'' said Dan Dabney,
a professor of economics at the University of Texas in Austin. The
International Monetary Fund, which stepped in to stabilize the
economic decline, ``acted too little and too late,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the bargains are not limited to southeast Asia. In
Australia, where the currency has tumbled to a 12-year low, travel
providers are looking to fill up half-empty planes and hotels. In
the past, they would have been full of Asian travelers.
</P>
<P>
   But what's been summarily bad for southeast Asia has in turn
become a major savings boon for U.S. travelers _ particularly those
going to Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Asia is not seen as a once-in-a-lifetime destination
anymore,'' said Cynthia Scott Severns, spokeswoman for Northwest
WorldVacations.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she said a four-night travel package in July and August
leaving from Atlanta to Bangkok _ including air, hotel and a
sightseeing tour _ would cost $855 per person. Last year's price:
$1,240.
</P>
<P>
   Similar savings abound. A five-night package to Singapore
departing from Austin _ including hotel, roundtrip transfers, and a
half-day city tour _ will cost $1,009 beginning this September.
Last year the trip would have cost $1,499, according to United
Vacations.
</P>
<P>
   Travel and booking agents also are tossing in extra incentives,
ranging from free meals to permitting an extra piece of luggage on
the way home to allow for shopping excursions.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one example: roundtrip airfare to Malaysia at $950 is
already 30 percent off from last year, according to World
Connections Travel of Atlanta. But toss in five free nights of
hotel accommodations, and you can see why the operating words for
agents when it comes to the depressed region are ``sell'' and
``market.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the countries and cities are getting into the act, say
industry spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Hong Kong: City of Life,'' is the slogan of a campaign
launched by the Hong Kong Tourist Association this month to spark
interest in visiting the Special Administrative Region (SAR), as it
has become known.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that Hong Kong's currency is pegged to the U.S.
dollar _ which provided some immunity to the continuing regionwide
devaluations _ the SAR has suffered a severe decline since the
Chinese handover.
</P>
<P>
   ``The successful transition of Chinese sovereignty has taken
Hong Kong out of the world media headlines and away from its
leading position in potential traveler's minds,'' said Lily Shum,
HKTA regional director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to reactivate consumer interest globally and convert
that interest into firm travel plans for 1998,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So travel providers are cutting prices on hotel rooms and
airfare to Hong Kong. A roundtrip ticket there via Japan Airlines
from Atlanta is $800 _ 30 percent less than last year.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers will also find terrific deals when shopping in Hong
Kong, where merchandise has been slashed up to 80 percent,
according to travel industry spokesmen.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   The same is true in Thailand, where everything from meals to
souvenirs has been cut drastically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get there, it's a heck of a bargain,'' said Marilyn
Staff, spokeswoman for Colorado-based Asia Transpacific Journeys.
</P>
<P>
   In Bangkok, a room at the Bel-Aire Princess, a four-star hotel,
costs travelers $65, down about 30 percent from last year,
according travel agents. And the rate at Bangkok's Royal Orchid
Sheraton is $120, down from $190 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bargains have transcended the region's borders as well.
</P>
<P>
   In Australia, tourists will find shaved prices on everything
from Sydney Opera House tickets, which have dipped from $48 to $34
since last year, to a night at the Coconut Beach Rainforest Resort,
which has fallen to $124 from $172 since last year, according to
the Australian Tourist Commission.
</P>
<P>
   But Ken Fish, president of Absolute Asia, a New York-based
travel firm, warns that bargains may expire as countries convert
their rates to U.S. dollars or inflate their local currency-based
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that southeast Asia represents a good travel bargain
is not necessarily a compelling reason to go,'' Fish said. ``(But)
if you ever wanted to visit Asia, this is the best time to do it.

ARBORVITAE PLANTS SUBJECT TO MITE DAMAGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have four bushes in my back yard that were 3 feet tall when
I first moved to Texas in 1988, and during the years they had grown
tall and well-shaped.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1992 I noticed a brown spot in one of the trees; the next
year it was larger, and two more trees showed the same damage. Now
all four are at least half-brown. This year they also seem to have
some sort of hard cap on most of the top branches.
</P>
<P>
   A: The plants you have are arborvitae. These evergreens do like
full sun as yours get, but they must have excellent drainage.
Unfortunately these plants are susceptible to spider mites and
bagworms, as well as leaf and stem blight. Your plants probably
have spider mite damage _ the hot, dry conditions are certainly
favorable for this pest _ but I think blight is also involved. I'm
sorry, but based on the photos you sent, I would remove the plants.
</P>
<P>
   The hard caps are berries.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A trunk began to grow from the middle of my cactus about two
months ago. I would like to know the name of this plant, how long
it lives after it flowers and other information.
</P>
<P>
   A: That is a giant flower stalk rising from your agave, or
century plant. This succulent can take 10 years or so for the plant
to flower, and it blooms only once. After that, the rosette of long
leaves dies, but often you will see ``pups'' sprouting around the
mother plant.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully dig the mother plant out and any young plants you wish
to have. You don't want the sharp points on the foliage to puncture
you. As you probably noticed with your mother plant, agaves
generally require little attention. Sun and good drainage will do
it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a fig tree that has grown quite high but does not
produce figs. Do I need to pollinate?
</P>
<P>
   I have a kalanchoe. It has not bloomed since I bought it. It has
grown in a pot and been transplanted, and it looks great, but no
blossoms. Any help will be appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your fig does not need a pollinator. Figs are parthenocarp
fruit, which means they do not require sexual fertilization. Figs
may show vigorous vegetative growth at the expense of fruiting. So
once your fig slows, it should produce figs. However, stress can
slow or prevent fruit production. Keep your tree well-watered and
heavily mulched.
</P>
<P>
   Kalanchoes generally flower in winter. The blooms are triggered
by short days. These succulents like good light but prefer not to
be exposed to harsh sunlight. They'll tolerate it but prefer bright
light. Provide a porous potting soil and water spring to fall. Then
decrease watering in winter. Allow the soil to dry between
waterings. Fertilize monthly during the growing season and avoid
air conditioning and heating drafts.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a plant that is 30 years old and produces red blooms
profusely. What is it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The photo you sent is of a fireman's cap or coral tree,
``Erythrina crista-galli.'' This small tree/large shrub will mature
to nearly 20 feet in height. It is subject to freezes and may lose
its top in cold weather but is usually root-hardy. It is also heat-
and drought-tolerant. The fireman's cap likes full sun and a
well-draining soil. This fast grower produces reddish-coral waxy
flowers in spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Which grasses will a cat eat?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have seen our cat munch on various ornamental grasses such
as Mexican feather grass, Japanese silver grass and purple fountain
grass. I've also heard that some cats will even eat a little
liriope. Although primarily meat eaters, cats sometimes seek the
nutrients in vegetation. They, of course, also love catnip. &QL;

AIR-FARE WARS HAVE NEW BATTLEGROUND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Our cable-television franchise added several new channels this
month, and while traveling around the dial, I came upon the Game
Show Network and ``The Price Is Right.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the modern-day version, in which everyone screams and plays
the fool. No, these were the original black-and-white episodes with
Bill Cullen addressing each well-dressed, seated participant as
``Mr.'' or ``Mrs.'' and conducting a serious, sedate bidding
process.
</P>
<P>
   A forerunner, I thought, of http://www.priceline.com.
</P>
<P>
   The newest strategy, or gimmick, if you prefer, in the airline
fare game, is an Internet site that invites travelers to name the
price they are willing to pay for a round-trip ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Forget published fares. Erase advance-purchase and
Saturday-night-stay-over requirements. If an airline with unsold
seats determines that your price is right, that's what you pay.
</P>
<P>
   Those not attuned to online shopping can play the game by
calling 800-774-2354.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   You pick the dates you want to travel. Your trip must begin in
the United States or Puerto Rico. You set the price you'll pay, and
Priceline will let you know within an hour via e-mail whether an
airline accepts your bid for domestic travel. A response to a bid
for international travel may take 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   You won't be surprised to learn that a few not-so-teensy-weensy
other details are involved.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, you get only one free bid _ for as many as eight
people traveling together _ per week per route, a restriction
designed to prevent extremely low bids. A second request incurs a
nonrefundable $25 fee.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you have no say as to which airline you fly. Priceline
guarantees only that you will travel on a major airline or its
affiliate. You have no say, either, about times of departure or
arrival other than to insist that flights depart between 6 a.m. and
10 p.m., or about whether you'll fly nonstop or via a connection.
Once tickets are issued _ all in coach class _ no refunds or
changes are permitted. And you accrue no frequent-flyer mileage.
</P>
<P>
   Industry reaction has been mixed.
</P>
<P>
   Travel Smart, a consumer-oriented monthly newsletter, cites
several travelers whose bids were accepted and concludes: ``Our
advice? Give Priceline a try. You have little to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   But the June Consumer Reports Travel Letter details an
exhaustive test marked by delays and rejections and says of
Priceline: ``The bidding system it uses poses some serious hidden
risks to consumers who use it. Travelers who aren't careful may
wind up paying more than they would have if they'd just called an
airline or travel agency. Perhaps travelers will become savvy
enough to figure out the right price for their first bid. As the
system works now, however, we're inclined to forget about Priceline
and find some other way to buy a cheap air ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   Several large U.S. airlines have said they are not involved in
Priceline. But would an airline admit to selling tickets for less
than a published price? Indeed, why would any airline participate
in such a wholesale distributorship? Simple reason: Airplanes flew
with more than 200 million empty seats last year.
</P>
<P>
   Intrigued travelers can access the Web site and follow
instructions to take a ``tour,'' offered with no obligation. The
Web site is more consumer-friendly than the automated telephone
message; besides, you'll pay a small fee for services rendered by
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Online instructions are clear, and you can progress through most
steps with no commitment. You are informed that you can increase
your chances of a bid acceptance by agreeing to use alternate
airports. For instance, when I inquired about a Houston-San
Francisco round trip, I was asked whether I was willing to fly out
of either Bush Intercontinental or Hobby and into San Francisco,
Oakland or San Jose. I also was told that if I would agree to make
more than one stop or connection and/or to take an overnight
flight, my odds would improve.
</P>
<P>
   Since I had no immediate travel plans, I stopped short of
supplying a credit-card number required for finalizing the process.
(For those hesitant to give this information online, a phone number
is provided.)
</P>
<P>
   But if I were making a price bid for real, I'd do considerable
research in advance. I'd check individual airline Web sites and
large multipurpose sites for any published specials. I'd access
http://www.bestfares.com to check out last-minute deals. I'd peruse
newspaper advertisements for tour packages that include air
discounts. I'd consult a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   And I'd carefully weigh the value of scheduling convenience and
frequent-flyer mileage.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be interested to hear from any readers who submit bids. My
gut feeling is that spur-of-the-moment leisure travelers may reap
more savings from Priceline _ since a participating airline would,
in effect, be waiving all advance-purchase restrictions _ than
those who plan ahead and study all options or those with
last-minute business needs that allow little flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   For now, I agree with Consumer Reports Travel Letter's
suggestion that the Internet would be an ideal mechanism for a new
system in which you specify the trip you want to take and the
airlines submit competing bids to you.

<P>
   That may well be the next venture in the online ``price is
right'' game.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Flip through an Elle magazine at Vain and you realize
this isn't your grandmother's beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
   Someone has taken a black Magic Marker and scrawled ``SEXISM
HARDCORE'' across Christy Turlington's bra-and-panty-clad torso in
a Calvin Klein ad.
</P>
<P>
   You look up and see Hannah Levin, a 27-year-old rock band
manager, admiring the platinum-blond stripes that now race through
her dark tresses.
</P>
<P>
   But then Jeanne Barrett, who is a bona-fide white-haired
grandmother from Leschi, pops in for a quick trim on her short,
``wash-and-run'' style.
</P>
<P>
   Both women feel at home at Vain, a Belltown mecca of magenta
hair dye, industrial-strength gel, grass-roots activism and
post-punk urban chic.
</P>
<P>
   That's the point, says owner Victoria Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to walk in and feel like they're going to
be ridiculed if they want something different,'' she says. ``(But)
I also want people who want something more conservative to feel
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, 34, has created some waves in the beauty industry with
her 2-year-old Seattle salon, quirky hair-care products, unorthodox
business practices and vow to celebrate ``alternative visions of
beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Vain, at 2222 Second Ave., has been featured in magazines such
as Redbook, Jane and Siren and in The New York Times lifestyles
section.
</P>
<P>
   Clients include band members of the Posies and Screaming Trees,
and the salon has its own Web site at www.vain.com
</P>
<P>
   Gentry's philosophy? Give the people what they want, whether
it's access to ``professional-only'' hair dyes or purple mohawks.
</P>
<P>
   Her customers leave Vain with glossy Marlo Thomas flips. Streaks
of fire-engine red. Spiky punk looks. And, yes, even conservative
bobs and crew cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of it is people looking for a transformation,'' she says.
``They don't like fluffy hair. They want hair that has texture.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve it, Gentry developed her own line of Vain products
with tongue-in-cheek slogans. They include ``2nd Day Hair: Shampoo
for marginally clean hair'' and ``Dirty Boy, Dirty Girl: Hair goo
for the rumpled masses.''
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey native, Gentry has streaks of ``cherry bomb'' red
in her own dark, shag-cut hair. She started cutting locks as a
punk-rock teenager when she experimented on friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``A friend of my brother's tracked me down on the Internet the
other day,'' she says. ``He said, `You gave me the most ridiculous
haircuts I've ever had.'''
</P>
<P>
   At 21, she enrolled in the Artistic Academy of Hair Design in
Fair Lawn, N.J. Her instructors were wide-eyed, to say the least.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were just upset at what my vision of beauty was,'' she
says. ``I only knew how to do mohawks.''
</P>
<P>
   To gain experience, she worked at a New Jersey mall salon and
perfected the ``big hair'' popular with customers there. But Gentry
soon tired of cookie-cutter styles and crossed the Hudson River for
liberation.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, she worked at an East Village salon in
Manhattan and amassed a loyal following of rock musicians, record
producers and artists. She also served as a hairstylist on
Lollapalooza tours.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she moved to Seattle and opened Vain. Her mission? One,
do something about the lackluster long hair that dominated the
grunge scene. And two, open a beauty shop that wasn't stuffy or
pretentious.
</P>
<P>
   The city also seemed perfect for her activist spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a very good demographic,'' she says. ``It
was a growing city. I wanted to be a part of that.''
</P>
<P>
   At Vain, Gentry keeps a kiosk stocked with American Cancer
Society brochures, free condoms, a list of organizations that do
animal research and information on Home Alive, a Seattle group that
offers self-defense classes for women.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry is a Home Alive advisory board member, has volunteered
with campaigns to free a Pennsylvania death row inmate and is
planning ``Hero Sisters,'' a conference to introduce girls to women
in non-traditional careers.
</P>
<P>
   She also wants to change an industry notorious for sticking it
to women _ narrow-minded beauty standards for exorbitant prices.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbing her nose at other salons, Gentry sells
professional-use-only hair dyes and supplies to do-it-yourselfers.
Usually such products are not available to clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's garbage,'' Gentry says. ``I want this to be
like a laboratory environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her peers, some are encouraging, others skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   One Belltown stylist, who wouldn't give her name, praised Gentry
for breathing life into the snooty world of upscale hair salons.
</P>
<P>
   ``She does that very edgy kind of thing,'' she said. ``You know,
a lot of crazy, fun colors. It's really great.''
</P>
<P>
   But another wondered if Gentry could be held legally liable,
say, if a customer buys professional-only dye and then damages her
hair or burns her eyes while using it at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not supposed to do that,'' said Joevir Morada, a
stylist at Fernando's Salon in Belltown. ``They will be held
responsible for whatever happens to their client. The coloring says
for professional use only.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gentry says she instructs customers interested in dying
their hair at home with salon-quality products.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to be excited about creating their own styles,''
she says. ``Not `I want to be Cindy Crawford.' I want them to be
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Vain's red walls are not plastered with photos of models and
movie stars. And customers are encouraged to develop their own
styles with the help of staff members.
</P>
<P>
   Her clients are mostly music industry types, but they also
include lawyers, doctors and people with more conservative looks.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett, the 72-year-old grandmother, settled into a chair at
Vain. She said she had just finished modeling for a photographer
friend who was shooting a magazine ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know for what,'' she teased. ``It might be an HMO. It
might be `Depends.' '
</P>
<P>
   Gentry giggled.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, the band manager, thumbed through a Rolling Stone. She's
been a customer for six months and couldn't be happier with the
Vain philosophy _ and the prices (cuts start at $28 and include
free trims).
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to go to an insanely expensive salon downtown where the
stylists were all very elitist,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a salon that feels feminist _ where you can be
interested in how you look, but not a slave to Mademoiselle.''

EX-CLINTON BUDDY MCDOUGAL'S REVELATIONS NOT TOTALLY BELIEVABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hell hath no fury like a business partner scorned. Jim McDougal
vowed to become Bill Clinton's ``worst nightmare'' two years ago,
when he abandoned his longtime defense of the president and started
telling Ken Starr what the Whitewater special prosecutor wanted to
hear.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal died in a prison hospital early this year, just as he
was wrapping up ``Arkansas Mischief: The Birth of a National
Scandal,'' a book co-written with Boston Globe reporter Curtis
Wilkie.
</P>
<P>
   The two Deep South populists have produced a book that is
immensely readable but not always believable.
</P>
<P>
   It is, in part, a modern political history of Arkansas, seen
through the eyes of a country boy who set out to do good and then
tried to do well. McDougal depicts a factionalized, one-party state
in which public and private business were freely intermingled.
</P>
<P>
   In one incident, powerful Sen. John McClellan, Congress' leading
prober of organized crime, pulls eight dollars from his billfold
and asks a lobbyist buddy to buy him a pair of alligator shoes back
in Little Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goddamn, senator,'' the lobbyist replies, ``They cost
sixty-four dollars. And besides, that's the first time I ever saw
you pull anything besides a handkerchief out of your pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougal has an initial knack for real estate deals, and makes a
bundle for such employers as Sen. J. William Fulbright. He has
spotted what seems like a sure-shot deal on the White River when
McDougal and his wife, Susan, run into the Clintons in a Little
Rock restaurant. It's 1978 and Bill Clinton will soon be elected
America's youngest governor. After a five-minute conversation, Bill
and Hillary Clinton were signed on as partners in the venture
called Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal presents a familiar view of Clinton. The future
president is charming, vastly intelligent and full of himself.
Clinton signs on as Fulbright's driver when the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee chairman is fighting a tough 1968 re-election
battle. But he promptly gets into arguments with Fulbright and is
banished from the car.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Hillary Clinton is compared to Lady Macbeth. It is
her cold, harsh treatment of Susan McDougal that helps persuade
ex-hubby Jim to start spilling the beans to Jeff Gerth of The New
York Times in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Once he told Clinton's 1990 gubernatorial opponent Sheffield
Nelson that there were beans to spill, McDougal was quickly passed
up the conservative food chain. ``Arkansas Mischief'' reveals a
high degree of collusion among Clinton's enemies, and extensive
cooperation between those enemies and dirt-digging Washington,
D.C., reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arkansas Mischief'' starts out as an entertaining tale, and a
clear-eyed look at how political decisions really get made in a
backwater state. But _ like Jim McDougal's career _ it comes
unglued.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the bitterness comes a basic point. If the Clintons
had reciprocated the loyalty and favors shown to them, a bitter man
would never have set in motion the scandal that has bedeviled an
otherwise successful presidency for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whitewater case unfolded because I wanted Bill Clinton to
feel my pain,'' writes Jim McDougal. In that assertion, at least,
he is wholly believable.
</P>

from the human obsession to find order in the world. But surely
there can be only one true explanation for reality: Life was either
created or it evolved. Prayer is either communication with God or a
psychological salve. The universe is either pervaded by spiritual
forces or ruled by nothing but physical laws. Now various groups
are seeking a resolution, including those involved in a recent

FTC CRACKS DOWN ON FOREIGN-LANGUAGE CIGARETTE ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ELIZABETH FERNANDEZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Federal Trade Commission has ordered that
cigarette advertising include the surgeon general's warning in the
same language as the ad.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was a victory for a Vietnamese-American man who
sought the requirement. In the past, cigarette ads aimed at ethnic
communities were printed in languages such as Vietnamese, Chinese
or Spanish, with health advisories in English.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was deliberate, it was part of a continuing effort to
mislead and deceive the public, and to recruit new smokers,''
health worker Anh Le said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Le launched a local grass-roots effort to force
tobacco companies to change this advertising practice. His
ammunition: letters sent by health officials and Asian-American
youngsters urging an advertising crackdown by the FTC.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will affect ethnic communities across the country,'' said
Le, who works with the Vietnamese Community Health Promotion
Project at the University of California at San Francisco. ``People
are puffing away _ if they are literate only in their native
language, they don't know the dangers. They have been deliberately
kept in the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the notice published Friday in the Federal
Register, the FTC said some advertisers had ``subverted'' the
original intent of a 1973 mandate for ``clear and conspicuous
disclosures'' in foreign language ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FTC is clarifying the original intent ... that all
American consumers, regardless of the language they speak, have
access to important information regarding the products they
purchase,'' the FTC said.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, which took effect immediately, applies not only
to the surgeon general's warning but to other required disclosures,
such as vehicle leasing ads or home mortgage ads, Matthew Gold, an
FTC lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC amendment applies not only to advertisements in
magazines and newspapers, but to any sales material, including
posters, videotapes or store awnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are on notice that this is how the commission will
interpret the law,'' Gold said. ``Its goal is to ensure that
whatever is being disclosed in the ad be effectively communicated
to the audience. It's a common-sense policy _ if you are talking to
Chinese people, you talk in Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This will reduce smoking habits. People will think twice about
smoking with the warning in their language,'' says Philip Nguyen,
executive director of the Southeast Community Center in San
Francisco and San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to change the ads was spearheaded by the
Vietnamese-American community in large measure because of the high
incidence of smokers among male Vietnamese, estimated to be 35
percent _ about 1.5 times that of the general population _
according to the Vietnamese Community Health Promotion Project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had people in my clinic with lung infections ... they
don't know that smoking could affect their health,'' said Kim Phung
Nguyen, a San Francisco pediatrician and member of the Vietnamese
Tobacco-Free Community Task Force.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cigarette ads are everywhere _ the ad is beautiful, slick,
the people in them have beautiful teeth,'' she said. ``The ad is in
Vietnamese but the warning is in English. People don't have any
clue what it means.''

BEN AFFLECK STRIKES WHILE SUCCESS IS HOT IN `ARMAGEDDON' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last fall he roamed among us almost unnoticed. Now
he's starring in a blockbuster, dating Gwyneth Paltrow, sporting an
Oscar and posing shirtless for the cover of GQ magazine.
</P>
<P>
   For Ben Affleck, it's been ``one weird transition'' _ and it
started between trips to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck first came to Houston last October for three weeks of
shooting ``Armageddon,'' a splashy sci-fi film due in theaters
Wednesday. When he returned for more work in January, things had
changed.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst was ``Good Will Hunting,'' a film Affleck co-wrote
with boyhood pal Matt Damon. Damon starred as a troubled young
Boston genius, with Affleck as his best friend.
</P>
<P>
   The drama drew rave reviews upon its release in December, then
earned $136 million in theaters. It also won Oscars for Affleck and
Damon for best original screenplay and for Robin Williams as best
supporting actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My life really changed between those Houston trips,'' Affleck
said, kicking back in baggy clothes in a hotel suite on what would
have been a rare day off _ if he didn't have interviews to do.
</P>
<P>
   During his first trip to Houston, filming was done at the
Johnson Space Center, and Affleck stayed at downtown's Four Seasons
Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out to dinner at a bunch of places, hit the bar scenes
on nights off, and everywhere I went, people were great,'' said
Affleck, a tall, gangly guy whose fast-talking intensity is
tempered by an aw-shucks cordiality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd heard Houston's rough, but it's a fun, friendly town _ and
as close to L.A. as I've seen in terms of freeways.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said the only folks who recognized him ``were
record-store clerks with nose rings and tattoos who knew me from
`Chasing Amy,''' a small, raw sex comedy in which Affleck had his
first starring role.
</P>
<P>
   Even on the ``Armageddon'' set, ``one driver thought I was just
there for a day or two,'' said Affleck, who turns 26 on Aug. 15.
``But by the end of the shoot, I was winning the Academy Award. It
was quite a jump.''
</P>
<P>
   The crew returned to Houston in January to film on an offshore
oil rig. ``That's when I started getting recognized,'' Affleck
said. ``It was a weird transition.''
</P>
<P>
   The cast ribbed him _ especially top-billed star Bruce Willis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd say, `I don't know what you did that little movie for,'
and I'd say, `My little movie made more money than `The Jackal,'
Bruce,''' Affleck said.
</P>
<P>
   Willis still teases him. Earlier this day, he claimed the
younger actor had a nervous breakdown and was crying while filming
scenes in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab, an astronaut training facility
at the Johnson Space Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lie,'' Affleck said, laughing. ``It's a lie
perpetrated by an older man who's envious and obviously running low
on Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   But wearing a heavy spacesuit in a huge tank of water was
unsettling, he said. ``If it leaked, it would drop like a rock.
That was scary.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Armageddon,'' Willis and Affleck play offshore oil drillers
whose expertise is needed when NASA detects a Texas-size asteroid
on a collision course with Earth.
</P>
<P>
   A crew of roughnecks is quickly recruited to take specially
equipped shuttles to the asteroid, drill holes in it and plant
nuclear bombs to blow it off course. Otherwise, humanity is doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the crew are Steve Buscemi (``Con Air'') and Texas-born
actor Owen Wilson, who co-wrote ``Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   Liv Tyler plays Willis' daughter, who's in love with Affleck (to
Willis' chagrin), while Billy Bob Thornton plays NASA's chief at
Mission Control, shot on a set in Culver City, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon's'' world-ending plot parallels that of Deep
Impact, which originally was considered the lesser film.
</P>
<P>
   After all, ``Deep Impact'' cost $75 million to ``Armageddon's''
$100 million and lacked a major star. Yet ``Deep Impact'' has made
a surprising $120 million-plus since its May 8 release.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' producer Jerry Bruckheimer _ the action maestro
behind ``The Rock`` and ``Con Air'' _ isn't sure if that's good or
bad for his movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``The positives are that I hope everybody who saw `Deep Impact'
will want to compare it to ours,'' he said. ``The negative is they
may be fed up with asteroid movies. But they are very different.''
</P>
<P>
   That statement is more truth than spin-doctoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Impact'' delves weightily into the emotions of diverse
people reacting to impending doom. ``Armageddon's'' high concept is
``The Dirty Dozen in Space.'' Driven by action and humor, it
concerns a single adventurous mission.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck was thrilled to get to play such a space-farer, although
his point of reference wasn't NASA. It was ``Star Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be an astronaut as a kid,'' he said. ``I
wanted to be like Han Solo _ an astronaut with a laser gun. I kept
asking (director) Michael Bay on the set, `Where's my NASA
pistol?'''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck credits Bruckheimer and Bay for hiring him when ``my
name didn't mean much.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew me from `Chasing Amy' and had seen some tape from
`Good Will Hunting.' I was surprised the way they greeted me. I
thought I was going to have to beg for this role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Jerry was able to sign me cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruckheimer has launched other actors to huge salaries via hit
action films such as Tom Cruise (``Top Gun'') and Eddie Murphy
(``Beverly Hills Cop'').
</P>
<P>
   Now Affleck, after watching friends Chris O'Donnell and Brendan
Frasier make millions, welcomes his shot at megabucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who says there's no such thing as professional
jealousy is a liar or a fool,'' he said. ``But I always wished
people the best. Maybe I'm naive, but I felt if I just kept
plugging, it would work out for me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked out first for Damon, who earlier starred in ``The
Rainmaker.'' Now both are not just stars but also business
partners. They just signed a deal with Miramax, which gets first
shot at their screenplays.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the big money comes from starring in big pictures, and
Affleck makes no apology for wanting to ``strike while the iron is
hot,'' much as Nicolas Cage has done since winning his Oscar for
``Leaving Las Vegas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No actor forgets the times he couldn't get a job,`` he said.
``I think everyone operates from that fear. It keeps you driving.
You don't want that momentum to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The momentum started in Boston, where Affleck and Damon grew up.
Affleck's family had moved there soon after he was born in
Berkeley, Calif. Both were bitten by the acting bug at a young age
(Damon, a Boston native, is two years older), and as young men they
hit Hollywood to seek fame and fortune.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't come all that quickly, despite their image now as an
``overnight'' success story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always me and Matt in some house with a couple of other
guys,'' Affleck said wryly of their early struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by meager roles, the two wrote ``Good Will Hunting''
``out of desperation.'' When selling it, they then insisted on
starring, just as an unknown Sylvester Stallone had done with
``Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the model for us _ the inspiration,'' Affleck said.
``It took five years between writing ``Good Will Hunting'' to
getting it made, but it was worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck is now starring with Sandra Bullock in ``Forces of
Nature,'' a romance filming in Savannah, Ga., that is due next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   His real-life romance is with actress Paltrow. She's the reason
Affleck splits time between L.A. and New York, where Paltrow lives.
</P>
<P>
   Sticking together is tough for actors who work apart on
location. They have to take time when they can find it. On this
weekend, Paltrow was seen entering the hotel where Affleck was
holding interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck's next release will be director-writer's Kevin Smith's
``Dogma,'' due later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a satire on the Catholic Church,'' said Affleck. (Damon
also appears in the film.) ``It's Kevin's take on the perils of
dogmatic beliefs and being inflexible.''
</P>
<P>
   When ``Forces of Nature'' wraps, Affleck plans to take a
breather. Since last August, the longest time he's had off from
work is five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too much,'' he said. ``I'm taking the fall off.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps from acting. But he'll still be writing with Damon, as
they finish their follow-up screenplay to ``Good Will Hunting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel an enormous amount of pressure,'' Affleck said. ``Once
you win an Academy Award, there's no way to live up to the
expectations. You're going to take some shots, and people will say,
`This isn't `Good Will Hunting.'' Then I'll say, `Thank God _ I
didn't want to write that movie again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Since writing is such a lonely, unglamorous job ``it helps to
have a partner to bounce stuff off of,'' Affleck said. ``But it
only gets fun when you start shooting the movie.''
</P>
<P>
   As for off-duty fun, if he had the time, the 6-foot-2 Affleck
would ``take a road trip on my motorcycle or drive around the
country with my brother (actor Casey Affleck, 22) in our Cadillac.
Or I wouldn't mind sitting home and watching TV for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Affleck is well aware that success ``comes and goes, and even
the biggest stars have peaks and valleys.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the valleys come for me, I hope to look back and say, `I
never believed the hype, I believed in myself, I always kept my
head, I never treated anyone badly and I tried to be a good
person.' Then I'll be able to live with myself.''

</P>
<P>
   The video shows footage of snake-infested brush as well as the
body of an immigrants who drowned earlier this month trying to wade
across the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   There also are shots of railroad boxcars that can feel like
ovens in the intense heat and are used to smuggle dozens of people
over the border at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better to live poor than to die trying to be rich,''
Letty Garza, a Border Patrol spokeswoman, warns in Spanish at the
end of the video.
</P>
<P>
   At least 10 illegal immigrants have died this month of apparent
dehydration on treks into the United States in torrid heat. It's
not uncommon for some undocumented immigrants to walk for days
through the brutal heat as they try to elude agents.
</P>
<P>
   Bodies of people who died of heat-related causes have been found
throughout the region. Several people have drowned trying to cross
the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this will make a strong impression,'' said Garza, a
former television news anchor who appeared on the video.
</P>
<P>
   ``It educates and warns illegal aliens about the dangers of
crossing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 300 immigrants die along the Texas-Mexico border each
year, according to a 1996 University of Houston study.
</P>
<P>
   Rogelio Nunez, executive director of Proyecto Libertad, an
immigration and civil rights group in Harlingen, said he doubted
the video would do much good because it doesn't address the causes
of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like: Say `no' to immigration or bad things will happen
to you,'' Nunez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen all these pictures of what drugs do and alcohol
does, and we haven't reduced it,'' Nunez said. ``I think people
know what they're up against.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is a part of Operation Lifesaver, a U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Service initiative.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the effort, Mexican radio and television stations
also are playing 30-second public service announcements warning of
the dangers of crossing the border.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: That good old mountain dew
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in which readers share
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, at
least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Marcus Gross, an Alabamian who found his way
to Texas, has vivid memories of ``them old cotton fields back
home.'' Here's his story:
</P>
<P>
   ``How often do we hear `the good old days.' Well, here is what I
remember of the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had our parents. We had our brothers and sisters. We had
our youth. What we didn't have was electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lived on a farm that wasn't all ours. It was called the old
Gross farm. We were dirt-poor cotton farmers. We plowed with an old
Ford tractor as well as horses and mules, mostly mules.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother got up early every morning to cook our breakfast,
and we were at work by daylight. When my mother cleaned up from
breakfast, she started dinner. What was left over from dinner was
our supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a spring with water so cold that you couldn't stand in
it barefoot. That's where we kept our milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of being cotton farmers, we raised such grains as
corn, barley and soybeans for feed. We planted sweet potatoes and
Irish potatoes, cantaloupes and melons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had several head of cattle, though not enough to count as a
herd. We had an old sow and raised pigs. What we didn't sell we'd
slaughter, salt down the middling and smoke-cure the hams and
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good smokehouse, and that wasn't all that went on in
the smokehouse, as I will tell you later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised up in a very religious family in the foothills of
the Appalachian plateau of north Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours was a small community. We had two churches, Methodist and
Baptist. We were Methodists in good standing. My daddy served as a
steward, something like the Baptists call a deacon, and our family
attended services and revivals religiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, more about that smokehouse ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Along with all the vegetables we raised, we also had an
orchard consisting of apples, peaches, plums, pears and grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We canned the fruit and vegetables and made jelly and jams,
and thrashed the peas that were dried.
</P>
<P>
   ``My Daddy and my two brothers and I picked the grapes,
muscadines and berries.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy had three five-gallon churns. We'd mash the fruit and
put it into those churns, also adding sugar, malt and yeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``After it had properly fermented, my daddy would take us boys
to the smokehouse after work and we'd all have a dipper of that
good old mountain dew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I will admit without question that I was the black sheep
of the family, and I still am.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister, my two brothers and I all served in World War II. I
was a paratrooper in the Southwest Pacific, but have nothing to
brag about as a hero. I was lucky to get, and probably didn't
deserve, the good conduct badge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no regrets of how I lived my life and if I had it to do
over I wouldn't change it one bit.''

TRIAL OPENS NEW CHAPTER IN CADET MURDER CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT THARP 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ At 21, David Graham would be entering his
third year at the Air Force Academy, by now learning to fly and
moving closer to becoming a fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   His former fiancee, Diane Zamora, would be on the same track at
the Naval Academy, her goal of being an astronaut still intact.
</P>
<P>
   And for Adrianne Jones, senior prom would be fresh in her mind
as she prepared to leave Mansfield for her first year at Texas A&AMP;M,
where she hoped to study psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four months after Zamora was sentenced to life in prison
for her role in Jones' death, the next chapter in what has become
known as the cadet murder case begins next week with Graham's
capital murder trial.
</P>
<P>
   Their teen-age goals seemed so certain in December 1995, before
Jones was found beaten and shot to death beside a remote road in
southwest Grand Prairie. Nearly three years later, they're just
well-publicized but unfulfilled memories.
</P>
<P>
   Graham is accused of being the trigger man in a plot spawned by
jealousy and a personal code of honor that the couple valued more
than a young girl's life, according to police reports and testimony
from Zamora's trial.
</P>
<P>
   And although they professed to be in love at the time of their
September 1996 arrests, Zamora defended herself against capital
murder charges by smearing Graham, a tactic that proved
unsuccessful with jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Graham watched from jail on Court TV as Zamora and her attorneys
painted him as a sadistic, gun-loving, sex-crazed tyrant who
listened to cult music and forced Zamora to go along with the plot.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's mother, Janice Graham, testified that she warned Zamora
about his temper and potential for violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``That defense to me was remarkable _ `David is Satan, but I
love Satan,''' Graham's attorney, Dan Cogdell, said in an
interview. ``It's always difficult to demonize a co-defendant
without putting yourself in hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicity from Zamora's monthlong Tarrant County murder trial
was so extensive that Graham's case has been moved 200 miles south
to New Braunfels out of concern that unbiased jurors could not be
found within the county. Jury selection is scheduled to begin July
6, and the trial is expected to last a month.
</P>
<P>
   In Zamora's trial, prosecutors presented testimony from close
friends of the two defendants, as well as the gun used in the
shooting and detailed confessions written separately by Graham and
Zamora. Prosecutors have said that evidence and core testimony in
Graham's trial will mirror much of Zamora's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a very difficult case to win? I'm not naive enough to
say that odds are in my favor of getting David an acquittal,'' said
Cogdell, a Houston lawyer who has gained a reputation in legal
circles, first as a protege of Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes and
later for representing one of the Branch Davidian cult members who
was acquitted of murder charges. ``I recognize that it's an uphill
battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining Graham's confession will probably be the most
difficult obstacle for the defense, legal experts say. Cogdell
already tried unsuccessfully to throw out a statement that Graham
gave to investigators while in Air Force custody, arguing that
Graham was held against his will and not informed of his
constitutional rights before he sat down at a computer screen and
began typing his four-page statement.
</P>
<P>
   The confession, which was leaked to the media before it was read
during Zamora's trial, is vivid in its description of Jones' death,
as well as the obsessed and consuming relationship between Graham
and Zamora. That relationship spun out of control when Graham
claimed he had sex with Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always being told by Diane that our relationship was so
perfect and pure. The love we shared would never be broken and no
one would never come between us,'' he wrote. ``No one, that is,
except that one girl that had stolen from us our purity.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Zamora's jealousy and Graham's desire to resolve the betrayal
combined to create the plan to kill Jones, a popular and active
Mansfield High School sophomore who ran track with Graham but had
never met -)mora, Graham wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The request of Adrianne's life was, not for a second, taken
lightly by me. ... Well, Diane's beautiful eyes have always played
the strings of my heart effortlessly. ... I didn't have any harsh
feelings for Adrianne, but no one could stand between me and Diane.
... I regret it now, for never did I imagine the heartache it would
cause my school, my friends, Adrianne's family, or even my
community. I guess I just shut it all out of my mind in that
instant when I convinced myself that Diane was even worth murder.''
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports and testimony from Zamora's trial,
Graham lured Jones out of her house on a Sunday night. With Zamora
hiding in the car trunk, Jones and Graham drove to a winding
country road near Joe Pool Lake. There, Zamora emerged from the
trunk, confronted Jones and struck her on the head with a weight.
</P>
<P>
   Dazed from the blow, Jones tried to run away, but Graham
followed her with a 9mm semiautomatic handgun. When she collapsed
on a barbed-wire fence, Graham stood over her and fired two shots
into her head, according to testimony from Zamora's trial.
</P>
<P>
   Police interviewed hundreds of high school students in the area,
including Graham, but didn't solve the case for more than nine
months. During that time, Graham and Zamora graduated from high
school _ he from Mansfield and she from Crowley _ and received
appointments to prestigious military academies.
</P>
<P>
   Once separated at the two military academies, the secret was
quickly revealed. Zamora told a fellow midshipman no fewer than 10
times about her involvement, according to trial testimony. That
midshipman _ who said he was romantically involved with Zamora _
never turned her in because he said he didn't believe her. She then
told two academy roommates about the killing, and they brought
their concerns to military officials within a day.
</P>
<P>
   In jail for nearly two years since his arrest, Graham has made
the transition from model cadet to model prisoner, adapting to the
highly structured schedule and rarely complaining, Cogdell said.
</P>
<P>
   Along Cedar Street across from City Hall, in an older part of
Mansfield, neighbors on the street of single-story homes with thick
grassy yards have only good things to say about the former
high-achieving student and his family. None of those residents
wanted to be identified for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in junior high, Graham displayed a single-minded
determination to pursue a military career, with the goal of winning
an appointment to the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. At
Mansfield High School, Graham wore his hair high-and-tight,
military-style, and served in the school's ROTC program.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the Civil Air Patrol squadron at nearby
Spinks Airport in Fort Worth, a common step for youths who want to
join the military and especially those who want a leg up at getting
into the academy. He rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel in the
squadron and learned about flying and rescue operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He appeared to be an outstanding young person, very sharp and
very knowledgeable,'' said Jim Gates, a lieutenant colonel and
emergency services director for the Civil Air Patrol. ``He had a
goal. He was going to go to the Air Force Academy and get his
wings.''
</P>
<P>
   That Graham faces capital murder charges still seems surprising,
Gates said. ``It just didn't seem like he was capable of something
like that.''

</P>
<P>
   Juvenile baseball leagues such as Little League can be traced
back to 1908 in rural Waynesburg, Pa., where a group of
civic-minded citizens had the inspiration of organizing an
unstructured series of baseball games into a league. The league
represented democracy in action, as sons of factory workers played
side by side with sons of the affluent. (slugged:

   As a travel writer, Shahin would like to provide summer
vacationers with sage advice on how to pack. But the truth is,
Shahin confesses, he doesn't have any tips. In fact, he doesn't
pack his bags. His wife does. This arrangement, he believes, is
quite common: Women pack the suitcases, men take pride in
methodically fitting them in the car trunk. (slugged:

</P>
<P>
   While family reunions offer a unique opportunity to reconnect
with one's kin, they also can bring to the fore all the simmering
tensions in a family. Do you invite the black sheep? Should you
finally unveil the big family secret? Crichton addresses these
issues, and offers a hilarious bonus in collaboration with Miss

<P>
   Family reunions often spark curiosity about one's ancestors.
With a bit of detective work, using oral interviews, government
records, genealogical associations, libraries and the Internet, the
family tree can be pieced together. Tannenbaum provides an
easy-to-follow guide for the novice researcher. (slugged:

 By PETER F. STEVENS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Two words pealed through the Pennsylvania air in the spring of
1908 and made history. Those words _ ``Play ball!'' _ were already
familiar across America.
 &HT;    But as they sent two baseball teams scurrying into motion on a
diamond in rural Waynesburg, a tradition was sown that would sprout
in every corner of the nation. For on that dusty diamond in
southwestern Pennsylvania, in a quintessential small-town setting,
America's first organized juvenile baseball league game was getting
under way. It was a precursor to the official Little League, that
most American of pastimes, which was not formed until 1939.
 &HT;    In 1908, Waynesburg was a thriving agricultural and banking
center with fewer than 3,000 people. Nestled near Ten Mile Creek
and bordered on the south by rolling farmland and rail fences, the
Pennsylvania hamlet differed little from any American town or big
city in at least one respect: Waynesburg teemed with farm boys and
bankers' sons alike who played baseball in any available pasture or
sandlot.
 &HT;    As with all American youths who idolized Cy Young, Honus Wagner
and the other big-league greats of the day, the youths of
Waynesburg bounded around makeshift base paths at every
opportunity. But they had little exposure to organized baseball
until high school.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1908, this changed. After a series of games
between two loosely supervised boys' clubs, a cadre of local
luminaries, including attorney Isaac N. Kuhn and journalist Guy
Ralston, noted the interest generated by the unstructured baseball
games.
 &HT;    The two men _ along with Fred High, business manager of the
Waynesburg Times newspaper, Harry Hicks, owner of a barbershop,
A.M. Nichols, and Sam Ogden _ professed ``an earnest desire . . .
to do something for the boys that will be of lasting benefit to
them,'' the weekly Waynesburg Independent (the town's other
newspaper) reported.
 &HT;    That something was the Waynesburg Juvenile Baseball League,
America's first ``Little League.''
 &HT;    The businessmen's brainstorm sent local boys scrambling to sign
up for the league's three teams: the North Side Cubs, the East
Waynesburg Winners and the Times Pirates, the latter made up
exclusively of paperboys who delivered High's newspaper.
 &HT;    Despite the Pirates' ``closed'' membership, the league was true
democracy in action: No boy was denied a spot on a team for lack of
money to buy a uniform, a cap or a glove.
 &HT;    To the delight of parents of modest or meager means, Kuhn and
the league's other backers paid for all uniforms and equipment. The
``money men'' also arranged for a 91-game schedule at a fenced
ballpark where the 9- to 14-year-old youths, proudly wearing their
team colors, would strut their stuff on the diamond.
 &HT;    The only on-field concession to the players' age came with the
league's decision to use a smaller-than-regulation-size baseball.
 &HT;    Parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters and friends paid 10
cents each to watch the three squads do battle. But when the first
echoes of pitches popping into catchers' mitts and bats cracking
into balls rose near Ten Mile Creek, the crowd saw an event far
more meaningful than mere baseball.
 &HT;    Across the field stood sons of affluence, sons of farmers and
sons of workers from the local malt plant or tinplate factory. The
world of financial castes dissolved for seven innings as
well-heeled parents rooted as boisterously for a laborer's son as
for their own.
 &HT;    No matter what their backgrounds, the players were learning
lifetime lessons beyond the virtues of teamwork and camaraderie.
The league's founders, pillars of the community, were determined to
instill in their players traditional American values of initiative
and education.
 &HT;    Kuhn and company asserted, ``We hope to be able to help the boys
... to help themselves.'' To that end, the league's creators
announced that all gate receipts would pay for a new library _ ``a
boys' library.''
 &HT;    Nearly half the town turned out for the games. And on Labor Day
of 1908, almost 3,000 fans watched a Pirates victory, the gala
event a tribute not only to the young players but also to Ralston,
Kuhn and their baseball-loving compatriots who, the Independent
reported, had all ``given their time to the boys without thought of
any return, except the boys' good will.''
 &HT;    The men earned not only the thanks of players and the community,
but they also turned a profit. With the season's ticket receipts,
Kuhn and company had accrued enough for 300 books for the boys'
library and enough to start another baseball tradition _ an awards
banquet for the players.
 &HT;    The success of America's first juvenile baseball league rippled
far beyond the banks of Ten Mile Creek, stirring something deep in
the nation's collective character. Every year, when America's boys
and girls don uniforms, adjust caps, scoop up gloves and dash onto
Little League diamonds, a welcome rite of spring and summer begins
anew.
 &HT;    Today, the legacy of the Waynesburg Cubs, Pirates and Winners of
1908 flourishes with every crack of a Little League bat.

<P>
   The sunshine-filled days of summer, so long awaited, have an
unfortunate downside: warm-weather health risks. Some, such as
mosquitoes, are merely annoying, but others _ such as heat stroke
or anaphylactic shock brought on by an allergic reaction to a sting
_ can be life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that almost all of these risks can be easily
minimized, if you follow some simple precautions.
 &UR; SOLAR MENACE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 40 percent to 50 percent of Americans will have a
sun-related skin cancer at least once during their lifetime,
according to the National Cancer Institute. This year, 800,000
Americans will be diagnosed with some form of skin cancer. The
culprits are ultraviolet rays A, B and C.
</P>
<P>
   UVA rays are the longest and penetrate deep into the skin,
damaging collagen, the connective tissue that keeps skin young and
firm. UVA is also the primary suspect responsible for malignant
melanoma, the most serious of sun-related cancers.
</P>
<P>
   UVB rays are medium in length, cause sunburn and seem to be
active participants in the other two types of skin cancer:
basal-cell carcinoma and squamous-cell carcinoma.
</P>
<P>
   UVC rays are mostly blocked out by the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   For sun protection, you have two options: Stay indoors, blocking
windows during daylight hours -- UVA rays go right through the
glass -- or apply sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Sunscreens work by absorbing, reflecting and scattering the
sun's rays on the skin. The Sun Protection Factor, or SPF, of a
sunscreen refers to how long you can stay in the sun until your
blood vessels dilate, increasing blood flow and signifying a
sunburn. A good rule of thumb is to multiply your sunscreen's SPF
by 10 minutes to figure out how long your sun protection will last.
</P>
<P>
   Good guidelines to follow: Use a sunscreen with an SPF of at
least 15. Stay out of the sun from 10 a.m. until 3 p.m. Wear
tightly woven clothing and a hat with a large brim to shield your
face.
</P>
<P>
   If you do happen to get a sunburn, chilled aloe-vera gel or the
contents of the aloe leaf applied to burnt areas can be soothing.
Also worth trying are chilled moisturizer, plain yogurt and
cucumber slices placed strategically around the burn site.
 &UR; SUN AND EYES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eyes are also prone to damage from the sun. Cataracts and
photokeratitis, the burning of the cornea and conjunctiva, are
directly linked to the sun and UV rays. Macular degeneration is
thought to be caused by UV and blue light as well.
</P>
<P>
   Sunglasses and a broad-brimmed hat are essential tools to keep
eyes healthy. In fact, a hat alone can reduce UV exposure by 50
percent. Buy UV-blocking sunglasses marked as being 99 percent to
100 percent UV-absorbent or with labels that read ``UV absorption
up to 400nm,'' which is the same as being 100 percent UV-absorbent.
 &UR; SUN AND DEHYDRATION &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The sun can harm the inside of your body as well as your skin
and eyes. Three types of dehydration occur in the summer: heat
stroke, heat exhaustion and miliaria, commonly known as heat rash
or prickly heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat stroke is the most severe and occurs when the skin loses
its ability to cool. Your skin becomes red, hot and dry, and your
breathing and pulse become rapid. Such a scenario is very serious,
since the high fever can lead to brain damage or even death. The
best action to take is to call an ambulance and try cooling the
body with water until the ambulance arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Heat exhaustion is caused by a rise in your body's temperature
and a drop in blood pressure. Your pulse will slow down, and your
skin will appear a pasty white or gray. Symptoms are loss of
appetite, headache, nausea, cramping and fainting _ all of which
can be prevented by drinking plenty of water before you go
outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're experiencing signs of heat exhaustion, cool
off with air conditioning and cold compresses and lie down with
your feet elevated. Sip water slowly to rehydrate your body. If the
symptoms do not go away or improve within a half-hour, go to a
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A heat rash, most common in fair-skinned people, is caused by
the inflammation of sweat glands. Heat rash can be prevented by
wearing loose clothing and avoiding spicy foods, hot baths and hot
showers.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe a heat rash, dust your skin with cornstarch or talcum
powder and take lukewarm baths with two to three tablespoons of
baking soda. Drinking lots of water and noncaffeinated beverages
will help the body replenish lost liquids.
 &UR; POISONOUS PLANTS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to the American Academy of Dermatology, 10 million to
50 million people per year succumb to the itchiness, swelling and
irritation of poison ivy, oak and sumac, making these plants the
most common cause of allergic reaction in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The itchy, swelling and oozing red bumps are caused by a sap
called urushiol. Urushiol is commonly transmitted by direct
contact, although it can also be spread by touching sports
equipment, gardening tools, clothing, shoes and animal fur that has
brushed against the plant.
</P>
<P>
   If you find one of the poisonous cousins in your backyard, don't
burn it! The urushiol can become airborne and cause severe lung
damage if inhaled. Even if you come across a poisonous plant that
looks dead, beware, because the urushiol can remain potent for as
long as 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to identify the plants is the best method of
protection. Poison ivy's characteristics are glossy, pointy leaves
in groups of three, seven or nine, yellow-green flowers and white
berries. It usually grows as a vine or shrub.
</P>
<P>
   Poison oak has rounded leaves, also in groups of three, seven
and nine. It has hairy yellow berries, and fuzzy leaves and trunk.
It usually grows west of the Rockies as a shrub, small tree or
vine.
</P>
<P>
   Poison sumac always has an odd number of leaves, as many as 13
per branch. This plant grows in northern wetlands and swampy areas
of the Southeast. It is usually found as a tall shrub with
smooth-edged leaves and cream-colored berries.
</P>
<P>
   An effective new way to protect skin against urushiol before
coming into contact with it is to use FDA-approved IvyBlock, a
lotion that dries to form a claylike coating.
</P>
<P>
   If you come into contact with any of the three plants,
immediately wash the skin with cold water. Don't use soap or a
cloth, as both can transport the poison to other parts of your
body. Wash all clothing and gear that also came into contact with
urushiol, preferably in chlorine bleach.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms usually occur within 12 to 24 hours after contact. A
serious case may include fever and acute inflammation. If your eyes
swell shut and you experience severe blistering, go to the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe the effects of poison ivy, oak and sumac, try applying
aloe vera, calamine lotion, buttermilk or a paste or compress made
from baking soda and water.
 &UR; STINGS AND BITES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Severe allergic reactions to bumblebees, honeybees, wasps,
hornets and yellowjackets affect one in 200 Americans, most
commonly people over 30, according to the American Academy of
Allergy.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways you can help avoid stings:
</P>
<P>
   + Wear neutral colors.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't wear shiny buckles, jewelry, perfume or scented
deodorant.
</P>
<P>
   + Cover opened soft-drink cans.
</P>
<P>
   + Keep garbage cans tightly closed.
</P>
<P>
   + Don't leave car windows open.
</P>
<P>
   + Place overripe fruit far from your picnic site to lure bees
and wasps away from your area.
</P>
<P>
   If you get stung, flick the stinger out with your fingernail, a
credit card or a knife. Never try to pull it out with your fingers.
This action could break the venom sacs on the stinger and release
more venom into the wound.
</P>
<P>
   To soothe stings, apply ice, baking-soda pastes, lemon juice,
vinegar or a deodorant containing aluminum chlorohydrate.
 &UR; MOSQUITOES AND TICKS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Your choice of effective insect repellents boils down to those
with DEET and those without, usually called natural repellents.
DEET has proven to be the most effective chemical against
mosquitoes and ticks. but you should read the label warnings about
possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   Natural products are usually based on citronella, a
lemon-scented Asian grass. If you choose to use a non-DEET
repellent, it should be reapplied often. Although citronella-based
repellents work well against mosquitoes, they have not proven to be
effective against ticks.
</P>
<P>
   Always check to make sure that any repellent you buy has an
Environmental Protection Agency registration number, indicating
that the product has been reviewed by the EPA and can be used with
minimal-to-low risk if the label instructions are followed.
</P>
<P>
   If you do get attacked, try applying baking-soda pastes,
swabbing the skin with witch hazel or taking baths with four cups
of baking soda to three cups of salt.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 From Diversion magazine. c.1996 Abby Tannenbaum 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, almost 100 years after his maternal grandfather left
Oliveto-Citra, Italy, to come to America, Dr. Louis Greco sat in
the town's city hall looking at an ancestor's birth certificate.
For the 73-year-old retired physician from Boone, Iowa, the trip to
the mountain village came some 40 years after he first talked to
his grandmother about her background and forebears.
</P>
<P>
   Greco's passion for his family history isn't unusual. Many
Americans become interested in their family's past after attending
reunions, holiday celebrations or funerals, where they hear stories
about distant relatives or realize they don't know a grandmother's
maiden name.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, for the past 20 years or so, the number of Americans
looking into their family histories has soared. Today some 113
million people _ four in 10 adults _ say they are interested in
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   Starting from scratch may seem overwhelming, but chances are you
already have some pieces to fit into your genealogical puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   First, write down the names of your family members as far back
as you can remember. Try to gather any written records, such as
birth, death and marriage certificates, in order to confirm or add
details. Pursue other personal sources _ family Bibles, diplomas,
old letters and diaries, photographs _ that provide additional
clues.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to interview your relatives. The National
Genealogical Society recommends asking basic questions about their
lives and those of other family members. Where did they live? What
kind of dwelling? Did they move around while growing up? When were
their relatives born? When did they die? Consider using audiotape
or videotape to record these interviews.
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with family members you've never met, initiate
contact by letter. Several genealogical books also include
extensive questionnaires that you can send to relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Although experts agree that information obtained orally from
relatives is invaluable, Shirley Langdon Wilcox, president of the
NGS, adds, ``Remember that stories aren't going to be 100-percent
correct, but they're a good starting point.''
 &UR; FOLLOW THE LEADS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox says that most amateur genealogists encounter apparent
dead ends. For example, one common problem is the assumption that
the current spelling of a family name is the way it has always been
spelled. Wilcox reminds researchers that people wrote down names as
they heard them.
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with a name, think about how it might
have been pronounced with a strong accent by an immigrant arriving
in the United States, or how it might have sounded to someone who
didn't know the language _ an immigration official, for example.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have written documentation for your family, you can
obtain vital records from government sources. Both birth and death
certificates contain names of parents and, often, mothers' maiden
names. However, this information is only as reliable as the person
who provided it.
</P>
<P>
   Each state has different laws governing public access to
records. The Department of Health and Human Services publishes a
helpful guide, ``Where to Write for Vital Records: Births, Deaths,
Marriages and Divorces,'' which provides specific information for
each state.
</P>
<P>
   Census records offer a wealth of information. At the New York
Public Library's U.S. History, Local History and Genealogy
Division, reference librarians often advise beginners who know that
relatives immigrated before 1920 to start their search by looking
at the 1920 census. From that they can learn such key data as the
name of the head of the family and the year of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Although federal law restricts public access to recent censuses,
records dating back 72 years or more can be found at the National
Archives in Washington, its dozen regional branches and a number of
specialized genealogical collections.
</P>
<P>
   The archives also publishes two helpful booklets: ``Guide to
Genealogical Research in the National Archives'' and ``Military
Service Records in the National Archives of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   More advanced researchers can go on to search probate records
and wills, deeds and land records, military and pension records,
naturalization petitions, church and cemetery records, and
immigration records, including ships' passenger lists.
</P>
<P>
   Public and university libraries and historical societies with
extensive genealogical collections exist across the nation. The
Family History Library of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day
Saints in Salt Lake City is a huge repository of genealogical data
for people of every religion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are 2,600 Family History Centers throughout
North America, where researchers can comb through the Mormons'
extensive microfilm holdings, including European records that are
unavailable elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Family History Centers and other genealogical
organizations have culled materials from Americans' countries of
origin, particularly Europe, some researchers, like Greco, pursue
their search outside the United States. The availability of records
varies. In general, your success will depend on how well a
particular country has maintained written records and how
accessible they are.
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, for instance, encourages people of Irish ancestry to
visit its villages, churches and cemeteries. The Irish Tourist
Board publishes an information-packed brochure, ``Tracing Your
Ancestors,'' which includes a map correlating family names to their
counties of origin.
 &UR; ON-LINE INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there's a good deal of genealogical
information available on-line. Making a connection to almost any
Web site on genealogy will lead you to countless more resources,
such as the Ellis Island Web site.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, people share information via chat groups on such
services as America Online. However, experts caution that not all
information posted is accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers trying to locate ancestors from Eastern Europe
should keep in mind that country borders have changed, and towns
that were once part of the Austro-Hungarian empire are now part of
such countries as Poland and Romania.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``From Generation to Generation: How to Trace Your
Jewish Genealogy and Personal History'' (Harper Collins, 1994),
Arthur Kurzweil suggests consulting maps and gazetteers _ and
considering a variety of spellings _ to find the name of a place
where your ancestors lived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you learn the name of the town,'' he writes, ``try to
find out where it was near.''
</P>
<P>
   His book includes a list of village names and the countries in
which they were located, based on a 1939 map.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've collected names, dates and copies of records, the
data can be organized in several ways. Many experienced
genealogists recommend using pedigree and family-group charts, and
birth, death and marriage forms. These charts and forms are
available from bookstores, mail-order catalogs and the National
Genealogical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Genealogical computer software is also an option. One of the
most popular programs, Family Tree Maker, offers a feature called
World Family Tree Project, which allows researchers to share
information with one another and makes available individual family
genealogies.
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of posterity, Janet Haase, owner of the
Genealogy House bookstore in Minneapolis, urges amateur
genealogists to record their information in some permanent form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to get information in long-lasting form that
can be passed among family members,'' says Haase, adding that all
copies should be made on archival-quality paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether your goal is to trace your family tree as far back as
possible, to collect hundreds of cousins or to visit an ancestor's
birthplace, as Greco did, genealogy is a rewarding hobby.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he's pursued genealogy with such zeal, Greco says
that it's to ``pass on something to the children.''
</P>
<P>
   After all, he adds, ``Writing it all down is a way to achieve
immortality.''

<P>
   Once summer arrives, one need only lean out the window to hear
the sound of the season: the zipping of suitcases. Doesn't matter
where you live, Madrid or Milwaukee, every town will empty itself
of residents and be filled again with tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans will be coming to America. Americans will be going to
Europe. Like racers at the starting gate, vacationers are ready to
bolt from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of them can go anywhere, though, they first have to
pack.
</P>
<P>
   As a travel writer, I'd like to help by providing tips for
efficient and effortless packing. Suggest, perhaps, rolling your
shirts rather than folding them. Divulge other little secrets of
the travel writer's trade.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I can't. I don't have any secrets. I don't pack.
</P>
<P>
   Back when I did pack, I inevitably got bored halfway through it,
went and read on the couch and eventually blew off the whole thing
until the following morning, when, in a panic, I'd throw a bunch of
stuff in a suitcase and rush out the door to catch my waiting cab.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was this decidedly not the way to begin a trip, but it
was also expensive. Upon arriving at my destination, I'd discover
that I'd forgotten my toothbrush or neckties or razor. Little
things, to be sure, but they added up, especially with the price of
annoyance factored in.
</P>
<P>
   I have found that aimlessly walking the streets of some exotic
locale, admiring its architecture, maybe stopping for a nibble and
a drink somewhere, is generally preferable to spending one's first
few jetlagged hours searching through neighborhoods for an open
store in which to purchase things you already own.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't much I ask of my wife that I wouldn't do myself. I
cook. I clean. But packing, that's her job.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always this way. I used to help. Gradually, though, I
started devising ways to avoid the dreaded task.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes my excuse would be that I needed to make a sudden trip
to the store for something I'd claim was essential for the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pens. Damn, I forgot pens. What if I get an idea on the plane?
Listen, I'll be right back. Would you mind just tossing that blue
shirt into the suitcase while I'm out, so I don't forget?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get stuck at the store awhile, maybe you could also pack
those black pants I like, the ones with the cuffs. Oh, and socks.
What, seven days, seven pairs? Maybe a couple extra, just in case.
See ya soon as I can get back. Thanks, hon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other times I'd feign an illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was something I ate,'' I'd say. ``I don't know, but
I'm not feeling so good. If it's OK, I'm going to lie down for a
while. If you need anything, I'll be on the couch.''
</P>
<P>
   Over time, the ruse wore thin and my wife, taking the path of
least resistance, simply assumed the role of designated packer. So
she is now the one who deliberates over the nature of the trip and
chooses the appropriate wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it may seem as though she got the raw end of the
deal. But she has received something extremely valuable in return:
my silence. For her, not having to listen to my constant whining is
probably reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   Theoretically, our arrangement also means that I don't
interfere. But I sometimes feel the need to exert control over a
project, even if it is not one I particularly want to be involved
in. It's a male thing.
</P>
<P>
   I'll wander into the bedroom while she's placing a pair of
carefully folded trousers into the suitcase and ask as nonchalantly
as possible, ``Did you remember the Hot Sauce Festival T-shirt?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim'' is her one-word reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just asking,'' I say. ``If there's room, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   I then leave the room, satisfied that I've overseen the
situation and it all seems in order.
</P>
<P>
   I have no survey or poll to back me on this _ which, I
recognize, is the only real way to legitimize one's observations in
contemporary America _ but I daresay that the packing deal we've
worked out is fairly common.
</P>
<P>
   I think it goes back to some mother-son thing. It was, no doubt,
Mom who packed the bags for camp and Mom who packed the lunch for
school and Mom who packed the overnight backpack for sleepovers.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why this whole women being from Venus and men being
from Mars thing seems a little ``Duh!'' to me. We all know that men
see themselves as warriors. Whether they're talking sports, cars or
music, you can hear the language of competition in their speech.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is not unreasonable to ask, ``Since when do warriors
pack their own underwear?'' The very image of Attila the Hun trying
to decide between warmongering outfits before going on a rampage
seems a bit farfetched to me. I don't know if Attila the Hun had a
wife, but if he did, I bet she did the packing.
</P>
<P>
   A woman friend of mine maintains that her boyfriend does his own
packing, and that he prefers it that way. I have a hard time
believing this.
</P>
<P>
   But she also tells me something that makes it plausible. He
packs badly. He tosses ill-fitting clothes into an old beat-up
thing that he drags around the world heedlessly.
</P>
<P>
   To rectify this, for Christmas she bought him an expensive new
bag, and before a business trip to New York she took him to a
clothier so he could get something decent to put in it. It's my
contention that, because he now has a nice bag and nice things to
go inside, he'll no longer trust himself to do the job.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong about all of this. Maybe most men pack their own
suitcases and pack the family suitcases as well. But it has been my
experience that, when it comes to travel, the only things men pack
are car trunks.
</P>
<P>
   They take the suitcases and bags and methodically arrange them
one by one, fitting them just so. I wouldn't be surprised if some
men are so engrossed by this that their tongues hang out of their
mouths like little boys working on a hard math problem.
</P>
<P>
   When they finish packing the car, they stand back from their
handiwork for a few seconds to admire it. That's a good pack job,
the look on their faces says.
</P>
<P>
   I can't say why packing a car is more satisfying to men than
packing a suitcase. I just know that that's how it is: Men pack
cars, women pack suitcases.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a book. I hope my wife doesn't forget to pack it.

 By PAULA GANZI LICATA  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    I have waited for most of my life for fair skin to be
fashionable. At long last, in recent years the healthy trend of
shunning the sun has gained popularity.
 &HT;    While some are still seeking the sun-drenched look with safe,
sun-free tans offered by products such as Neutrogena and Bain de
Soleil's sunless tanning sprays, many are opting for pale. Movie
stars and fashion models, the barometer of female beauty, are
flashing fair flesh.
 &HT;    No one could appreciate this revolution more than I. Too easily
burned, I speak from the experience of many long, hot, colorless
summers. I rubbed on sunscreen, and I paid the price of unpopular
pale. For years I suffered through shouts of ``Yo, milk!'' while
all those bronzed bodies in string bikinis strolled by.
 &HT;    But I wasn't always this smart. Etched in my memory are the days
I would set out determined to get a tan _ no matter the cost. I
would lie and soak up as much sun as I could stand. Most of my
friends loved this part: The Big Bake. I hated it.
 &HT;    I could feel the sting of sweat mixed with chemicals from the
lotion. The sun's rays penetrated my sunglasses, through the
tissues I had saturated in cold water, and irritated my eyes. I
could feel my skin being drained of every molecule of moisture.
 &HT;    After a day at the beach, the others came home rested and brown
_ the ultimate goal, aside from meeting bronzed, Adonis-like men _
and I came home exhausted, itchy and burned.
 &HT;    But I persisted. I tried all the deep-tanning, tropical lotions
_ the pina colada ``smell-alikes'' _ only to come home with a rash.
When I greased up in pure baby oil, I fried like a piece of bacon.
The quick-tanning stuff tinted my skin orange.
 &HT;    Self-acceptance finally arrived. Mom was right _ I realized I
would forever resemble the ``before'' picture in a Coppertone
advertisement.
 &HT;    I took comfort in the knowledge that I would never get that
tough, leather-like skin _ the sun worshippers' reward. The rest of
the year I would have the peaches-and-cream complexion that the
sallow, olive-skinned population would envy. And I would never have
to worry about wrinkles due to the sun or melanoma.
 &HT;    At age 20, I bade farewell to the tan and the sun-drenched.
Feeling more confident about my long white legs and alabaster skin,
I began anew. Gone were the days of panic and pressure to battle
beach traffic on a hot summer day.
 &HT;    And then I met Robert, who loved to bake on the beach. So I
compromised. I can now be spotted on the beach beneath a large
umbrella, outfitted in a coat of sunblock, a man greased in oil
lying in the sun by my side.
 &HT;    Every summer there are more umbrellas on the beach. And each
season brings more sun products to the shelves. The SPF numbers are
getting higher, and baby oil is slipping as a serious contender.
Ads now boast, ``Rethinking the beach: the new wave in sun care,''
``Smart fun in the sun'' and ``Shun peak sun: If your shadow is
shorter than you are, run for shade.''
 &HT;    It does this fair-skinned woman good to see signs of change in a
world that once defined beauty as a California tan. Will the future
resemble the days of Scarlett O'Hara, when parasols protected ivory
skin?
 &HT;    I think not. The most I can hope for is equal rights: the right
not to be asked if I've been ill all summer or trapped in a dark
cave for the past few months.

 &UR; By JENNIFER CRICHTON &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese proverb says, ``No family can hang out the sign,
`Nothing the matter here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Every family has its issues, its patches of unresolved conflict,
its difficult personalities who will most likely remain difficult
until death relieves them of all difficulty. Few of us view all
family members with unalloyed adoration.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that anxieties and ambivalences, regrets and
doubts, are not incompatible with love. And families _ even those
that are slightly nuts _ are not incompatible with growth and
change.
</P>
<P>
   Family reunions can be a time and place in which relationships
out of kilter can be put back on track again. What has been left
dangling can be connected. Those most prone to being left outside
looking in can be drawn across the threshold and into the heart of
the family.
</P>
<P>
   For some, the prospect of a family reunion raises uncomfortable
feelings bordering on dread, as memories of less-than-perfect
relationships with family surface. But with a bit of thoughtful
effort, relationships can improve, and reunions are just the place
to strengthen what's right and valuable in them.
</P>
<P>
   Below are common family problems and tactical responses for
coping with them. Some responses were suggested by family
therapists Evan ImberBlack and Janine Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   Should we invite my uncle, the family black sheep, to the
reunion?
</P>
<P>
   Unless a relative has committed a heinous, unforgivable crime _
failing to call Grandmother at Christmas is not in this category _
he or she should be invited to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps your family _ or at least you _ are now prepared to cope
with, even enjoy, what makes other family members different. And
perhaps the black sheep was not all that radically different to
start with.
</P>
<P>
   How can those who feel outside the family loop _ single people,
middle-aged people who haven't had kids, gays or freewheeling
artist types _ take their place in the family circle?
</P>
<P>
   If possible, those who feel like outsiders should try to get
involved in the reunion planning. By doing so, they help create the
reunion in their own image and bond with other family members in a
shared effort. As a result, they're viewed by those attending as
family insiders.
</P>
<P>
   Those who don't meet certain family expectations should try
before the reunion to figure out what common ground they do have
with other family members and build on that: an interest in family
history, for example, or being terrific with young children. They
can then sponsor a genealogical workshop at the reunion, for
instance, or help in the crafts cabin, emphasizing aspects that
they share with other family members.
</P>
<P>
   What if I have a major issue I want to settle with a family
member _ or a big family secret that has been unconfessed for
years?
</P>
<P>
   Reunions should not be used as a forum in which to work through
long-standing issues before a large, live audience. If you have a
bone of contention with a relative, deal with it person-to-person.
Plan in advance to take an hour or two out of the reunion and go
off by yourselves to talk things over. What this approach lacks in
drama, it makes up for in effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   What do I say to relatives who've gone through hard times _
fighting cancer or losing a job or getting divorced? Or maybe I
shouldn't say anything at all?
</P>
<P>
   Keeping silent isn't the answer. Better to make some kind of
supportive remark than simply ignore the situation. The person
who's been going through a difficult time can pick up on your
expression of concern or shut down conversation. Take the cue, and
respect it. But often they will welcome the reaching out, and a
reunion is a good time for it.
</P>
<P>
   As one recently divorced woman said shortly after her family
reunion, ``I was dreading the reunion. I felt like such a failure.
The divorce was so raw, like an open wound. But at the reunion I
felt such acceptance from the family that I could let down my
defenses.''
</P>
<P>
   What can I do to get my spouse interested in the reunion?
</P>
<P>
   The archetypal inlaw at a reunion is a reluctant person who
would rather break rocks in the hot sun than struggle through an
exchange of small talk with Great-Aunt Dorothy. But handled with
care, a spouse can be brought into the fold, more or less
painlessly. Here are a few guidelines:
</P>
<P>
   Request only one command performance a day. Then let your spouse
go his or her own way _ fishing, golfing, to the mall or back to
bed.
</P>
<P>
   Limit dwelling in the past. Sure, a reunion can bring inlaws
into the family culture by imparting family stories, history and
Uncle Ed's really bad jokes, but few spouses can cope with a
nonstop immersion into a family's past.
</P>
<P>
   Suggest reunion activities that your spouse actually likes. If
the reunion features his or her kind of fun _ fishing, golf,
sailing _ he or she will be happy to return the next time.
</P>
<P>
   Give your spouse the family he or she has always wanted. If you
cajole your significant other into attending the reunion, and lay
off his or her case once there, your spouse might discover for
himself what the reunion has to offer _ more people to love and be
loved by.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad deal at all.
 &UR; -0- &QL; 
 &UR; SIDEBAR: TEN COMMANDMENTS OF REUNION ETIQUETTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A reunion isn't controlled by protocol, as a wedding is. And
each family cultivates its own idiosyncrasies. Still, a few laws do
govern reunions _ laws that must be followed lest the world be
thrown into chaos and confusion. And we don't want that.
</P>
<P>
   So, with the help of Judith Martin, also known as Miss Manners,
we've drawn up the following commandments.
</P>
<P>
   1. Thou shalt not forget thine ordinary manners nor thy common
civility, just because thou art among thy brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   2. Thou shalt tolerate thy tiresome relative _ at least for a
little while.
</P>
<P>
   3. Thou shalt not play footsie with a distant cousin or thy
cousin's spouse.
</P>
<P>
   4. Sniping and carping about a reunion's lack of organization is
an abomination.
</P>
<P>
   5. Thou shalt orchestrate spontaneous praise unto the reunion
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   6. Thou shalt not talk about everything under the sun. Agree to
disagree, and steer clear of such topics as abortion rights, gay
marriage or gun control.

LOST IN THE '60s WITH RICKY THE K 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN AUSTIN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a lot of people, Ricky the K is stranded in the '60s. He's
obsessed with classic '60s Top 40 radio.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is, he's making his obsession pay off by creating
his own station and selling subscriptions to listeners on the
Internet for a three-hours-a-day, five-nights-a-week dose of mirth,
music and vintage Winston cigarette ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the HBO of radio,'' said Ricky the K, a 47-year-old
New Jersey transplant who operates out of a 400-square-foot
custom-built studio in his Garland, Texas, back yard. ``This IS
'60s radio.''
</P>
<P>
   If you don't remember radio when the original stations were
rocking with new music from ground-breaking artists, dial up
www.60sradio.com. for a sample of Ricky the K's Solid Gold Time
Machine. If Real Audio is loaded in your computer system, $20 a
month or $150 a year will get you an almost endless supply of great
music. And it's stuff that you don't hear on what local stations
try to pass off as ``oldies.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Ricky the K, a k a Rick Kaufman, owns about
10,000 singles and albums, and what he doesn't have on wax is on
CD. And he's not afraid to play 'em.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking everything from the Shadows of Knight version of
``Gloria'' and the Hombres with ``Let It All Hang Out,'' to Ray
Stevens and, because Kaufman is a Jersey kid, king-size doses of
doo-wop. The music format encompasses material from the early '50s
through 1971, and none of the songs is played more than once every
nine weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman also covers the other missing element, which is
entertainment, complete with weird sound effects and ongoing
conversation with Tonto, the Lone Ranger's faithful sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be a great disc jockey you have to be able to ad lib,'' he
said. ``That's what made '60s DJs. The guys were characters,'' he
said, going on to contrast his skills with most of the current crop
of jocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a guy with a designated laugher chick,'' he said,
regarding most of our popular radio teams. ``They all have the IQ
of a grape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The qualifications have gone downhill 'cause they don't want
to pay any money,'' Kaufman said. ``Water seeks its own level. If I
was 18 today I wouldn't want to be a DJ.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he sees it, great Top 40 began to die in 1968 when some
programming genius decided that DJs should do nothing more than
keep the music running and just talk over the beginnings and ends
of songs.
</P>
<P>
   Couldn't agree more. And Kaufman is right on the money when he
sizes up the ``researchers'' who make a good living feeding radio
programmers bad advice. The disastrous results are available for
sampling daily on the radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They program oldies for people who really don't like oldies,''
he said, explaining that advertisers want young listeners, not
people who love his brand of radio. ``They're trying to skew
younger.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the improving technology should improve his sound
quality, and cheaper space on the Net should drive his costs down.
That means good things for him, even though the rest of radio needs
a massive brain transplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's gonna be a time when this music will be completely off
the radio and I'll be the only place to get it,'' he said. ``I hope
it gets worse. It only makes it better for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you want to hear the show while you're driving around,
Ricky the K has a solution for that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You tape it off your computer,'' he said. ``Then you drive
around and listen to it.''

GERMANY, GOING ON THE ATTACK, RALLIES TO DEFEAT MEXICO, 2-1  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELLIER, France _ At the end, after two hours of playing in
temperatures above 90 degrees, exhaustion replaced celebration.
Juergen Klinsmann raised his arms, but could not keep them above
his head. Andreas Kopke, the German goalkeeper, collapsed on his
back, and defender Christian Worns writhed on the ground as his
muscles cramped in protest. But, until the whistle blew, Germany
had been as relentless as the heat.
</P>
<P>
   The European champions play for long periods where they appear
vulnerable and eminently beatable. But this is only a mirage.
Theirs is a pitiless style. For 90 minutes they play with a
merciless determination. They fall behind but they do not quit. A
Mexican goal two minutes into the second half did not unnerve
Germany Monday _ just the opposite _ it liberated the Germans to
begin a charge of their own.
</P>
<P>
   When this riveting game was over, Klinsmann and his partner at
forward, Oliver Bierhoff, had each delivered their third goals of
the World Cup, and Germany had prevailed 2-1, earning a berth in
the quarterfinals on Saturday against the winner of Tuesday's match
between Romania and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play according to our strength, our fighting spirit,''
Klinsmann said. ``We keep going and going and fighting and
fighting. You must be physically prepared especially when it is so
hot. You must be tough. We have to fight for 90 minutes, and we try
to instill fear in the other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Mexico was not afraid, but it did let a 1-0 lead fall away like
dripping sweat as defender Raul Lara made two critical errors. In
the 74th minute, Germany went to three forwards, as Coach Berti
Vogts inserted Ulf Kirsten, the leading scorer in the Bundesliga,
alongside Klinsmann and Bierhoff. A minute later, Dieter Hamann
sent a long diagonal pass into the penalty area, but Lara could not
trap the ball. Klinsmann, waiting, punched the deflection into the
net as Jorge Campos, the Mexican goalie, made a futile slide to
disrupt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always expect to get a pass and score a goal,'' Klinsmann
said. ``Even when it was 1-0, we never lost our trust and
confidence. It freed the team, gave us energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Four minutes from the end, Germany scored again, this time on a
play that was beautifully precise in the way it unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Lothar Mattheus, starting again at sweeper, pushed through the
middle of the field and sent a pass to Michael Tarnat on his left.
Tarnat chested the ball and lifted it across the field to Kirsten,
who left-footed a pass for Bierhoff in the penalty area. Bierhoff
led the Italian League in scoring this season with great
reliability in the air. He had hit the crossbar in the first half,
but this time he headed Kirsten's pass just inside the right post,
and Mexico had been clinically dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   For Mexico, this will be forever remembered as a chance missed.
</P>
<P>
   In the 47th minute, the Mexican forward Luis Hernandez finally
eluded Markus Babbel, who had been a late addition at starter in
the German defense. For 41 minutes, Hernandez had not touched the
ball. But now, he escaped Babbel in the penalty area, took a pass
from Cuauhtemoc Blanco and kept drifting, drifting to his right.
</P>
<P>
   Tarnat stumbled and both Worns and Kopke went to the ground,
attempting to block the shot, but Hernandez knifed it between them
for his fourth goal of the World Cup and a 1-0 lead for Mexico. In
the first round, Mexico had fallen behind three times before
catching up. This time, it scored the first goal but could not hold
on.
</P>
<P>
   The game may have turned on a wild scramble in the 62d minute,
when Mexico's energetic replacement in midfield, Jesus Arellano,
stole a pass from Babbel and sprinted toward Kopke in the German
goal. Mattheus caught up, but in kicking the ball away from
Arellano, he nearly scored an own goal. Kopke dived and seem to
rake the ball with his fingers, sending it into the left post. The
rebound was passed to Hernandez, but his shot was fired directly at
Kopke. With that escape, Germany began to grow stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first Mexican goal was a shock,'' Klinsmann said. ``But
we were never worried about getting back into the game, because we
have an instinctive fighting spirit.''

FORT WORTH POET JESSE F. GARCIA GIVES ROCK 'N' ROLL DREAMS A VOICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jesse F. Garcia, Fort Worth's rock 'n' roll poet, is a
mild-looking 46-year-old graphic artist who sports a trim mustache
and short, neat hair.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the combination of avocation and appearance would seem to
be a contradiction. But there's no questioning Garcia's allegiance
to the music of the Rolling Stones, Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, the Who,
the Grateful Dead and dozens more _ right up to R.E.M. and Rage
Against the Machine _ the minute one starts reading ``Rock 'N' Roll
Dreams,'' his slim, self-published first volume of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dreams,'' the images _ of the Beatles, of Hendrix playing
Fort Worth in 1970, of the sad waste that was John Lennon's death _
spill off the pages in classic Beat style.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia takes us back to the days of teen-agers cruising
drive-ins, of the chaotic '60s and right on up to Generation Xers
who only want to move to Seattle and become grunge wannabes. And in
conversation, the light of a true fan still shines as brightly as
that of, say, a kid who has just heard ``Stairway to Heaven'' for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want people to really find out about music, not just what
they hear on the radio,'' he says by way of explaining one of his
reasons for assembling the poems, all of which have been written in
the past eight years. ``I want them to see if a guy really has
talent. Like in the '70s, when disco was so popular _ there were a
lot of good New York bands nobody knew about, like the New York
Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe _ no, probably _ Garcia has remained a fan all these years
because rock 'n' roll literally, he says, saved his life. Born the
son of migrant workers and raised in Devine, just south of San
Antonio, Garcia first heard R&AMP;B via a wind-up Victrola that
belonged to the only black family in the barrio where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   He'd go over and listen to Big Joe Turner doing ``Shake, Rattle
and Roll,'' and then he graduated to records by Little Richard and
Chuck Berry. And when the Beatles exploded, he was the only
Hispanic kid with a Beatle haircut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other Chicanos threw rocks at me,'' he says. ``They
thought I was trying to be white.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he was 10, he was picking cotton alongside men and
women as his family worked in the fields around South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so poor we couldn't afford cockroaches,'' he says.
``I'm serious. What saved me from committing suicide was a
transistor radio, Top 40 rock 'n' roll.''
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, in a bookstore in San Antonio, Garcia bought
Allen Ginsberg's ``Howl'' for $1 and immersed himself in the world
of the Beat writers. And he began writing, although his early
stuff, he says, was horrible ``self-centered, `feel sorry for me'
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, when he was a high school sophomore, his father got a
much better job as a warehouse laborer in Fort Worth, and his
family moved to the north side.
</P>
<P>
   This was a boon for a longhaired kid who wanted to hear as much
music as possible and talk about counterculture icons like Chairman
Mao, Angela Davis and John Sinclair. Garcia spent a lot of his time
at Panther Hall, where he saw the Dead and Bob Seger; at Will
Rogers, where he saw Hendrix; and at the Convention Center, where
he saw the Stones, Led Zeppelin and Neil Young.
</P>
<P>
   He kept writing, too, and doing readings of his work, even as
the music began to turn stale. During the past few years, Garcia
has been published in the local literary magazine ``Nothing
Shocking,'' the Colorado poetry journal ``Red Dirt,'' and in
``Unsettling America: An Anthology of Contemporary Multicultural
Poetry,'' alongside Quincy Troupe and Beat hero Lawrence
Ferlinghetti.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there's rock 'n' roll anymore,'' he says.
``Everybody's gotten repetitive. R.E.M. and Rage Against the
Machine are the only really good bands keeping rock 'n' roll alive.
I think it started when New Wave started coming out with
synthesizers. Other than guitar, saxophone and piano, you cannot
have rock 'n' roll. The only inspiration I look to now is Bob
Dylan.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this year, he gathered his favorite poems about music
and published them, in no small part, he says, because ``all the
poets now are putting out these horrible, repetitive books. All
they write about is themselves. They're not good, and they're not
saying anything, and it's because they haven't experienced hard
times. In my day, if you didn't work, you didn't eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia is proud of where he has come from, but he's also proud
that he got out of the hard barrio life of his parents. Rock 'n'
roll and poetry _ coupled with a fierce desire to be educated and
not to work in the fields like so many people he grew up with _
were what got him to this place, where he has a decent job that
affords him some free time to listen to Dylan on his CD player and
to write.
</P>
<P>
   And some day, he says, he'll find a publisher for a second
volume of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people write to amuse their ego or their libido or
their intellect _ I write to amuse myself,'' he says. ``I'm
selfish. I want to keep the issues alive _ the government, ecology,
social injustice. And once in a while, I write a mushy love poem.''

METROPOLITAN DIARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ko) 
 By ENID NEMY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A weekly column featuring readers' reports on life in the Big
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I come from a bunch of pretty typical New Yorkers,
each of us imbued with a healthy dose of self-importance, each of
us convinced that he or she is working harder and doing more than
anyone else. Consequently, orchestrating attendance at a midweek
family occasion, as I needed to do for my daughter's school play,
can be an act of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of filing legal papers close to deadline, I called
my parents' office to choose a train that would get them to us in
time for dinner and the show. They were in a meeting, and my mother
had little patience as I fumbled with the train schedule. I, in
turn, had little patience with her lack of patience, and we shared
tight-lipped exchanges as we selected a train.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all done, I sighed audibly and asked: ``Mother, do
you have any idea how burdensome it is sometimes to be your
daughter?'' Expecting an argument, I was shocked to hear her sigh
in return and ask: ``Sally, do you have any idea how burdensome it
is sometimes to be me?''
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, I declared a truce.
</P>
<P>
   _SALLY WASSERMAN
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Laitin's 13-year-old grandson, Adam Curtis, lives in a
suburb of Washington and constantly complains to his grandfather
that he's a ``big city boy,'' living too far away from the action.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Laitin asked him how he'd like to visit New York, and
Adam immediately listed the things he'd like to do there _ the
David Letterman show, F.A.O. Schwarz, and the Metropolitan Museum
of Art among them. The trip was arranged, and Laitin managed to
meet all the requests.
</P>
<P>
   After an exhausting weekend, the two were strolling crosstown on
West 57th Street when Adam summed up his visit. ``Grandpa,'' he
said. ``This is a town that could really keep up with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Estelle Cohen and her husband were in a large bird store looking
for a gift for their son. After buying a feeder and a book on the
care of hummingbirds, they were told they should get a six-foot
pole to hang the feeder on. While Mrs. Cohen was paying, her
husband exclaimed, ``We can't take that pole, we're going on a
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Without a moment's hesitation, the woman behind them said,
``Just tell them you're a shepherd.''
</P>
<P>
   The blue-haired lady with the fluffy white dog tucked under her
arm was pursuing a second dog that had obviously strayed. As she
looked hither and yon, she called out ``Sotheby. Sotheby.'' Michael
Zentman had no doubt about the name of the dog she was holding. It
had to be ``Christie.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked. It was.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Alterman was leaving a movie theater recently when he
encountered two women with stroller-age children. One woman was
holding both children as the other woman struggled with her
stroller. The struggling woman was becoming increasingly
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, she burst out: ``You know, just because we have
maternal instincts doesn't mean we know how to operate strollers.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those seriously rainy days that we've had in the
last few months and Steven Ng spent 20 minutes with his arm
outstretched, trying to get a taxi. Finally, a vacant cab appeared.
Ng shook himself off, checked the water content of his clothes,
settled in and spotted the medallion number: 2H2O.
</P>
<P>
   Two young women were taking their seats near the back row of the
Delacorte Theater for a performance of ``The Skin of Our Teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Christensen overheard the following conversation.
</P>
<P>
   First young woman: ``It's so far away from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Second young woman: ``That's OK. They talk loud in
Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   One: ``This isn't Shakespeare.''
</P>
<P>
   Two: ``Yes, it is. It's Shakespeare in the Park.''
</P>
<P>
   One (looking in program): ``But it says `by Thornton Wilder.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two: ``He's the adapter. They've made it into a comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not his original creation but Armen Khachaturian got a
laugh out of the dictum of his friend, Greg Monsees, to his four
children and their dog. Monsees is separated from his wife, and the
children's primary residence is with their mother.
</P>
<P>
   His communique:
</P>
<P>
   Re: Amy's Stolen Car
</P>
<P>
   1. If you don't have enough money for putting the car in a
parking garage, do not drive to New York.
</P>
<P>
   2. If it is absolutely impossible for me to help you until the
next morning, do not call in the middle of the night. I seem to do
my best sleeping at 3:45 a.m. and
</P>
<P>
   3. If you do call, please do not begin with the phrase, ``Dad
I'm not calling you at this hour of the night with good news.''
I've already made that assumption.
</P>
<P>
   Love, Dad

   _ CONSTANCE BROCK
</P>
<P>
   A message from a guidance counselor at a prestigious suburban
school asked that Phyllis Bocian get in touch as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bocian returned the call almost immediately. A woman with a
foreign accent answered.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bocian: ``Marion Benson, please.''
</P>
<P>
   Voice at other end: ``She isn't in.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bocian: ``May I have her voice mail?''
</P>
<P>
   Voice at other end (after small pause): ``He isn't here
either.''
</P>
<P>
   Selma Glick was reminded recently of the day some years ago when
she had to go to work but two friends, one a visitor from Oregon
and the other a New Yorker, went to the Statue of Liberty. The two,
who had had some experience mountain climbing, decided to walk up
the stairs to the top. The Oregonian reached the top first and saw
a group of people drinking champagne.
</P>
<P>
   This must be the New York reward for climbing, she thought, and
politely asked, ``May I have one?'' She had just received her drink
when the New York friend joined her and was promptly advised to go
over and also claim her reward.
</P>
<P>
   The New Yorker did as suggested and also received a glass of
champagne but she suspected that the champagne wasn't a climbing
reward.
</P>
<P>
   She inquired of the group and was told that they were Russians
who had waited for years for permission to come to the United
States. They promised each other that when they got to America,
they would go to the top of the Statue of Liberty and drink
champagne.

WACO CHURCH HIRES STATE'S FIRST FEMALE SOUTHERN BAPTIST SENIOR
PASTOR (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KRISTIN N. SULLIVAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a new seminary student, Julie
Pennington-Russell often knelt before her 8 o'clock classes ``to
pray for all the poor women who thought they were being called to
become pastors.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, as she delved into studies in theology, philosophy
and languages, she said she found biblical evidence that a woman
can lead a church.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think deep inside I had always thought, `This is a crock.
God loves us the same,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Pennington-Russell became associate pastor of 19th
Avenue Baptist Church, a 90-member congregation tucked between San
Francisco's crowded row houses. In 1993, she agreed to become the
church's senior pastor.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Pennington-Russell is preparing to come to Texas as the
state's first female senior pastor of a Southern Baptist church,
stoking a debate that has divided Baptist conservatives and
moderates since the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington-Russell, who turns 38 on July 4, will give her first
sermon as senior pastor of Waco's Calvary Baptist Church on Aug. 9.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,300 women have been ordained as ministers in
churches affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention, the
nation's largest Protestant denomination. Only 85 are senior
pastors or co-pastors, and most of them work in North Carolina,
according to Baptist Women in Ministry, a support organization
based in Kansas City, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Pennington-Russell's appointment is controversial, coming as it
does on the heels of this month's Southern Baptist Convention
resolution advising women to ``submit graciously to the servant
leadership'' of their husbands.
</P>
<P>
   But even as interview requests have poured in from the ABC and
Fox TV networks, radio talk shows and other media,
Pennington-Russell has downplayed her newsworthiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to serve as pastor of the state of Texas,'' she
said. ``I'm going to serve this one church that I care deeply
about. And I think they care about me. And we'll walk together a
while. Hopefully, a long while.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Purdy, chairman of Calvary Baptist's pastoral search
committee, called Pennington-Russell ``an extremely gifted
preacher'' whom members hired after agreeing not ``to put any
limits on the leadership of the Lord.'' She won the job on a 190-73
vote among members.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the secular world, that'd be a landslide,'' Purdy said.
``We're excited to have her.'' Pennington-Russell said she has
enjoyed 16 years of ``being completely unselfconscious'' since she
enrolled in California's Golden Gate Baptist Theological Seminary
in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ohio, Pennington-Russell moved a lot during her
childhood because her father served in the Air Force. She said her
mother became a Christian at age 21 and raised her daughter and son
in a variety of Baptist churches _ American, Southern, Independent
and conservative _ until the family settled in Orlando, Fla., and
joined the city's First Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   Tradition at First Baptist held that ``women were not allowed to
preach, read Scripture or speak from the pulpit at all,'' although
they could sing, Pennington-Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Her father wanted her to be a dentist. But Pennington-Russell
earned a degree in speech pathology from the University of Central
Florida. With a desire to study Christianity outside the Bible
Belt, Pennington-Russell said, she moved cross-country and enrolled
in Golden Gate Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   She became convinced that women could lead in the church in her
first year of studying the Bible and the original languages of
scriptural text.
</P>
<P>
   In her view, the Bible's many examples of women prophesying and
teaching validate the role of women in the ministry. Church elders
and overseers are usually referred to in groups, a fact that
Pennington-Russell said does not exclude women from being senior
pastors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot think of any reason, except for a quest for power or
a wielding of authority, for anyone to limit what God can do in the
lives of men and women in the church if it's going to further the
church,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many conservatives, however, believe that her argument is off
base.
</P>
<P>
   They point to passages in 1 Corinthians in which Paul writes
that women should be silent in church and to Paul's letter to
Titus, in which Paul instructs older women to teach younger women.
Others hold up New Testament definitions of bishops and deacons
calling for such leaders to be the ``husband of one wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely believe in the total equality of men and women.
Men and women equally bear the image of God,'' said Daniel Akin,
dean of the school of theology at Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, Ky. ``But God has given men and women
different assignments in the home that beautifully parallel the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Akin added: ``Anything you do to get to women being senior
pastors, you have to extrapolate.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Lea, dean of the school of theology at Southwestern
Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, said he interprets
Paul's prohibition against women teaching men or having authority
over men in 1 Timothy to mean that women shouldn't hold the office
of senior pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some would carry it so far to say a woman shouldn't teach
Sunday school. But I don't carry it that far,'' he said. ``Because
there are differences in opinion, I am hesitant to make it an
article of faith or test of fellowship. It is possible to differ at
this point and still be a Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Brad Creed, dean of the George W. Truett Seminary at Baylor
University, said that as he listened to Pennington-Russell preach
her tryout sermon at Calvary Baptist, his Bible fell open to Acts
2:17, in which Peter predicted that in the last days ``your sons
and your daughters shall prophesy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It might not be right for every church culturally, but I don't
think Scripture disallows it,'' said Creed, who is serving as
interim pastor at the Waco church until Pennington-Russell starts.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Becca Gurney of Austin, president of Baptist Women in
Ministry, said she finds the continuous arguing over female pastors
``tiresome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not getting the Gospel told,'' she said. ``Anyone who
commits their lives to the Gospel and sharing the good news, we
should welcome them and say, `You go, girl!' or, `You go, guy!'''
Pennington-Russell doesn't appear rattled by the debate. The only
time she recalls her gender being an issue in her San Francisco
church was when she became pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Congregation leaders developed a maternity leave policy and gave
her 12 weeks' paid leave with Taylor, now 7, and Lucy, who is 3.
Church members and visiting professors filled in as interim
preachers, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, in 1993 and 1997, 19th Avenue members were denied voting
and speaking privileges at the California Southern Baptist
Convention because the church was led by a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Only recently have some 19th Avenue members confided to
Pennington-Russell that they had briefly questioned whether they
could be comfortable with a female pastor.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, she said, ``An inordinate amount of women
have said, `I feel so free to talk about things with my pastor'
that they might not have discussed with a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Comfortable sitting cross-legged on the floor of her office in
bluejeans or breaking sourdough bread at the pulpit for The Lord's
Supper, she said she's looking forward to the transition to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Pennington-Russell and her husband, Tim, won't
have to spend 2 1/2 hours driving back and forth across the Golden
Gate Bridge getting Lucy to preschool.
</P>
<P>
   Tim, who met his wife while studying at Golden Gate Seminary, is
a free-lance Web site developer who has already been contacted for
a new job. And the couple has purchased a 2-story, brick home ``on
this beautiful tree-lined street'' for the same amount a friend
paid for a one-bathroom studio apartment in San Francisco,
Pennington-Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   With Waco's Baylor University nearby, Pennington-Russell said,
she hopes to brush up on the Spanish she learned in college,
particularly because Calvary Baptist's 300 members include a number
of Spanish-speaking families as well as African-Americans and
Anglos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in a smaller town where people know each other and you
really feel tied in to the community was very attractive to us,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Pennington-Russell's new church was the site
of a protest staged by East Texas followers of the
ultra-conservative Rev. W.N. Otwell, leader of the God Said
Ministries of Mount Enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters, who are not affiliated with the Southern Baptist
denomination, held signs saying that Pennington-Russell ``needs to
go home and be a wife and mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Pennington-Russell said, however, that Waco and the Baylor
campus have been a haven for ministers who share her beliefs,
particularly since the 1994 opening of Truett Seminary as a
moderate alternative to Fort Worth's more conservative Southwestern
Seminary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The support network that I knew would be in Waco was a huge
attraction,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Baptist leaders say it is unlikely that Calvary Baptist will be
penalized in any way for hiring a women pastor.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Baptists, we believe in the congregational form of
government in most of our churches. As they make their decisions,
we honor the autonomy of each local church,'' said Paul Stripling,
executive director of the Waco Baptist Association. ``I would hope
that each of our sister churches would honor that concept.''
</P>
<P>
   Calvary Baptist, along with many other nominally Southern
Baptist congregations, is affiliated with a moderate group separate
from the convention, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. About 85
percent of Calvary Baptist's members this year earmarked their
contributions for the fellowship, while 15 percent of the members
designated their money for the convention, said Purdy, of the
Calvary Baptist pastoral search committee.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Merrell, a vice president for the Southern Baptist
Convention, said he expects Calvary Baptist to continue to
``distance themselves more and more'' from the convention under
Pennington-Russell's leadership. He added that the New Testament's
rules for church governance cannot be dismissed ``without great
harm to the people of God.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such criticism, Pennington-Russell said she's not going
to leave her religious heritage ``in the hands of a few who I think
have grossly skewed what it means to be a Baptist Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're free to do that, and I don't wish them ill,'' she
said. ``But I'm not going to abandon my tradition to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Leland Harden, song leader at 19th Avenue in San Francisco, said
he's confident that Pennington-Russell will handle whatever
adversity comes her way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Julie is a trailblazer without being a femi-nazi,'' said
Harden, referring to talk show host Rush Limbaugh's label for
feminist activists. ``She's a leader focused on the calling of God.
If she's blazing trails, so be it. But she has Christ's agenda, not
her own.''

 &HT;    AT THE RAILWAY STATION: CHINESE MULL CLINTON'S DEMOCRACY MESSAGE
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service (at)
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _At the old Beijing train station Monday people were
playing pool, tending fussy kids, buying snacks. And a few dozen
followed a very abnormal pursuit: listening raptly to President
Clinton talk about freedom and democracy.
</P>
<P>
   What they and perhaps half a billion other Chinese heard was
Clinton's unprecedented argument on behalf of freedom and changes
that are seldom even whispered about today.
</P>
<P>
   Some Chinese enthused. Many thought Clinton was meddling. But
even among the latter, thoughts lingered that some good might come
of his words.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some day China becomes more open, we should remember and
mark this visit of Clinton,'' said Lai Zheng Xing, 26, a computer
programmer in the special economic zone of Shenzhen, who watched
Clinton in the shabby waiting room. ``He was excellent.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't draw huge crowds to the station waiting rooms
where televisions beamed out his speech. But then again, entry into
the waiting rooms cost from 62 cents to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
   A cook, a cop and a waitress slipped in and out to catch a few
words between their duties, and several travelers who strayed in
from the cafeteria quickly got entranced by Clinton and anted up
the payment when spotted by a curt attendant.
</P>
<P>
   The White House scored a second diplomatic success Monday, by
airing live on national television Clinton's 57-minute speech and
question-and-answer session at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   Winning Chinese permission for a nationwide television broadcast
had been a priority goal for Clinton, who wanted to present his
vision of a free China. This was his second live broadcast in three
days. The first was an unprecedented televised news conference cum
debate between Clinton and Chinese President Jiang Zemin last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Neither appearance was an undiluted victory.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese listeners raised widespread complaints about the
less-than-fluent translation of Clinton's university speech, which
was done by a White House-supplied translator. And the bad quality
audio transmission meant parts of the event couldn't be understood
at all, including the questions from students, most of which were
barbed and critical of U.S. policy.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael McCurry said the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs complained about the translation because ``they had
wanted to interpret it,'' but the train station listeners also
objected that it was hard to understand.
</P>
<P>
   And last Saturday's news conference with President Jiang also
was a mixed blessing. Some Chinese were disconcerted and even
embarrassed by the direct nature of Clinton's critiques of human
rights practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Chinese feel very unhappy and many people watching with
me were very angry about that. He went a bit too far,'' said Wan
Yihua, a factory manager from Jiangxi province interviewed at the
train station. Wan found the Monday speech ``more friendly'' than
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   How Clinton's comments will resonate over future months and even
years is impossible to gauge. His visit could spur demands for
democratic change or bring out a nationalistic backlash, as seemed
to be the case among young questioners at Beijing University.
</P>
<P>
   For example, one student asked Clinton how he would like it if
China sent arms to Hawaiian leaders in a hostile frame of mind,
paralleling that with America's sale of arms to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States policy is not an obstacle to the peaceful
reunification of China and Taiwan,'' Clinton responded, repeating
America's stand in support of one China, undivided.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton got little more than polite applause during his speech,
in which he not only challenged the students to work to alleviate
worldwide ills such as pollution and drug abuse, but also made a
case for opening China's political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We (Americans) believe and our experience demonstrates that
freedom strengthens stability and helps nations to change,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   How Clinton's nine-day sweep across China will change the power
balance within China's inner leadership is something his deputies
shied away from addressing. ``We can't predict,'' said McCurry.
``This is not a transparent regime and there's still, and will
remain, aspects of the Chinese leadership that remain opaque to
U.S. decision makers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Susan Shirk, deputy assistant secretary of
state for east Asia, said that previously taboo subjects, like
repression in Tibet and the crushing of the 1989 democracy
movement, have been brought into the open.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be possible to bury those subjects again,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   China's reticence to embrace democracy is not simply a matter of
autocratic leaders refusing to give over power to the masses.
Plenty of average Chinese also fear how the masses might wield
power.
</P>
<P>
   Even the computer programmer Lai, who heartily endorsed
Clinton's comments, cautioned that change must come slowly to China
and with some restraints. He cited the cultural revolution, that
decade of pandemonium from 1966 to 1976 when mostly young people
smashed vestiges of authority across the nation, as an example of
``democracy and freedom out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Chinese are even more reluctant to accept the kinds of
changes Clinton proposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He talked a lot about freedom. But Chinese people are mostly
concerned with economic problems,'' objected Wan, the factory
manager who had early lunch as he awaited a train and watched
Clinton. ``They don't have a very strong demand for freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Wan said he feared ``too much democracy'' would cause chaos
among Chinese who tend to solve problems ``with their fists and
their feet.'' Yet he gave an unexpected summing up when asked what
is the best result Clinton's visit might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might make politics and freedom of speech more relaxed,''
said Wan, 32. And he thought that would be okay, if it didn't go
too far and too fast.

THE WAY AN AUDIT OUGHTA BE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday July 1)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   News item: A bill up for a vote in Congress promises a kinder,
gentler IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor: Thank you for coming in this morning, Mr. Fribbish.
Could I get you a cup of coffee? A danish? A foot rub?
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer: No, thank you. Listen, about those charitable
deductions. I don't know what I was thinking ...
</P>
<P>
   Auditor: Please, Mr. Fribbish. We didn't call you in here to
question your charitable deductions. If you say you gave $30,000 to
the Society for the Prevention of Cats, even though you claim an
income of only $25,000, we're willing to believe you. How's that
chair, by the way? Is it comfortable? Here, why don't you sit in
mine.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer: Oh, I get it. You're setting me up. As soon as I stand
up to switch chairs then that's the signal for the thugs to barge
through the door and beat me in the kidneys with rubber truncheons.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor: You have quite an imagination, Mr. Fribbish. Let me
assure you that the days of the bad old IRS are gone. No more
rubber truncheons, no more threats, no more holding people up by
their ankles and shaking them until the money falls out of their
pockets. We're here to serve the taxpayer and make sure that the
process of filing one's tax form is as rich and rewarding an
experience as possible. Champagne?
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer: Well, maybe just a little.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor (pouring from a bottle of Dom Perignon): You see, Mr.
Fribbish, for a long time the IRS was an arrogant, abusive agency
that you challenged at your own risk. Our favorite targets were the
poor, the elderly or the under-educated. (Looking wistful.) Boy, we
used to soak them good.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer: Mind if I take off my jacket and loosen my tie?
</P>
<P>
   Auditor: Not at all! Perhaps you'd like to change into one of
our complimentary fluffy robes and embossed slippers. We give them
away free to every taxpayer who comes in for an audit.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer: Why, thank you. Don't mind if I do.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor: But all that's changed, Mr. Fribbish. Today's IRS is
here to serve the taxpayer, not harass him. We want people to pay
only as much as they're comfortable with. And if April 15 rolls
around and you find yourself a little short, no problem. We'll
carry you as long as you need, interest-free.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer: What about all those tax forms? They're awfully
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor: Let me let you in on a little secret, Mr. Fribbish: The
IRS never understood the tax forms, either. We just pretended we
did so we could intimidate people into giving us more money. More
champagne?
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer: Don't mind if I do.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor: From now on, if there's an instruction or a form or a
schedule you don't understand, just give us a call and we'll send a
tax lawyer out to your house _ absolutely free, of course _ to help
you sort the thing out.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer: What about records and receipts? You people were
always badgering us for that stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor: Wasn't that annoying? As if the average American
citizen didn't have better things to do than keep track of every
little $10,000 business expense. Today's IRS isn't going to
nickel-and-dime you to death over that stuff. If you say you needed
to buy a Learjet to take you back and forth to your lawn-mowing
job, then, by gum, we believe you. Are you sure you aren't hungry?
Our chef makes a mean pate.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer: Come to think of it, I am feeling a bit peckish.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor (refilling taxpayer's champagne glass): Your wish is my
command, Mr. Fribbish. Is there anything else I can get you?
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayer: Actually, I was wondering if you could audit me again
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Auditor: Consider it done.

By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Bobby Wroten, the prestigious Fort Worth hand surgeon who
fixed Juan Gonzalez's left thumb last year, was peering at my
X-rays. We can relieve the tingling and numbness, he said, keep
your hands from falling asleep and restore some of the strength,
but it's not going to get rid of all your pain.
</P>
<P>
   I had arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   That was five years ago, plenty of time to have recovered from
successful carpal tunnel surgery on both wrists and to become much
more aware of the lingering pain of arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   Thumbs throbbing, fingers stiff, wrists aching, neck and
shoulders burning like muscles pushed to the limits of exercise,
arthritis can wake you up at night _ sometimes with tender spots
that feel as if you must have been sleeping on pea gravel.
</P>
<P>
   Others say arthritis feels like having shards of glass in your
joints.
</P>
<P>
   I take a lot of Tylenol and Aleve and have tried cortisone
injections and capsaicin cream, the topical analgesic made from red
pepper.
</P>
<P>
   I've never hurt badly enough to deliberately submit to bee
stings in the hope that the venom might relieve the pain, but some
arthritis sufferers are willing to take that risk.
</P>
<P>
   They spend more than $1 billion a year on unproven remedies for
the pain and inflammation of more than 100 different types of
arthritis, according to the Arthritis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend as much on unproven remedies for this disease as we
do on research,'' says Dr. Bernard Rubin, chief of rheumatology at
the University of North Texas Health Science Center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Arthritis is prone to unproven, fraudulent and even dangerous
treatments because so many people suffer from it _ 40 million
Americans today, expected to hit 59.4 million by 2020 _ and because
there are no effective drugs that work long term for everybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``People grasp at straws. Sometimes patients feel doctors don't
give their arthritis enough attention. There must be something
better out there, so they go looking for it,'' Rubin says.
</P>
<P>
   Something better _ in the form of a whole new class of
anti-inflammatory drugs that fight pain and joint destruction
without destroying the stomach and kidneys _ made headlines this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Cox-2 inhibitors, being developed under the names Celebra and
Vioxx, are expected to outsell even Viagra, the impotency pill that
became the fastest-selling drug in history.
</P>
<P>
   Cox-2 drugs are not more effective, just safer. They are easier
on the stomach and can be taken in larger doses for a longer time
without damage to the stomach or kidneys. They could be on pharmacy
shelves by early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most exciting developments in the treatment of
arthritis in 25 years because we potentially will be able to treat
people for their pain and inflammation without them suffering the
side effects,'' says Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   Cox-2 drugs are a type of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such
as Naproxen and Ibuprofen. Anti-inflammatories are drugs that
reduce both pain and swelling by neutralizing the enzymes that
cause them. Researchers have identified two types of this enzyme:
cox-1, which releases chemicals that protect the stomach against
peptic ulcers, and cox-2, which releases chemicals that cause
inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   The old class of drugs inhibited both enzymes. The new class of
drugs selectively works against cox-2 enzymes _ without inhibiting
the cox-1 enzymes that protect the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   It's a development that could be worth billions. Arthritis
sufferers spend millions to pay for unproven alternatives because
it gives them a sense of mastery over their pain and because they
mistakenly believe that traditional medicine has nothing to offer,
says Dr. Doyt Conn, senior vice president for medical affairs for
the Arthritis Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, the public's misconception that tends to lump
all forms of arthritis into one package, and to assume that it's an
inevitable part of aging and nothing can be done about it _ all
misconceptions,'' Conn says.
</P>
<P>
   The term ``arthritis'' includes more than 100 disorders that
attack cartilage in the bone joints. The disease causes pain,
swelling and loss of movement when bone rubs against bone after the
cartilage has deteriorated. The best treatment depends on the
specific diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Among the most common types of arthritis:
</P>
<P>
   OSTEOARTHRITIS, or degenerative joint disease. Affects an
estimated 15.8 million Americans, mostly over age 45. It involves
the breakdown of cartilage and bones through wear-and-tear
injuries, and is most often found in the fingers and weight-bearing
joints including the knees, feet, hips and back.
</P>
<P>
   RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS. One of the most serious and disabling
types, affecting an estimated 2.1 million Americans. It involves a
genetic abnormality in the body's immune system that causes
inflammation in the lining of the joints that can damage cartilage
and bone. It often leads to crippling deformities in the hands,
wrists, feet, knees, ankles, shoulders, neck, jaw and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   JUVENILE ARTHRITIS. A general term for all types of arthritis
that occur in children. An estimated 300,000 children in this
country have the disease; most have juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   FIBROMYALGIA. Affects approximately 3.7 million Americans,
causing pain and tenderness at points where muscles attach to
bones. People with fibromyalgia frequently experience fatigue,
disturbed sleep, stiffness and sometimes psychological distress.
</P>
<P>
   GOUT. A painful condition that most often attacks small joints,
especially in the big toe. It is caused by a defect in body
chemistry and usually can be controlled with medication and changes
in diet.
</P>
<P>
   BURSITIS AND TENDINITIS. Result from irritation caused by
injuring or overusing a joint. Bursitis affects a small sac that
helps muscles move easily. Tendinitis affects the tendons that
attach muscles to bone.
</P>
<P>
   It is critically important to first find out what kind of
arthritis you have, according to the experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually there are lifestyle measures that are very
important,'' Conn says. ``If you have osteoarthritis of the knee
and you are 20 pounds overweight, that weight is a big factor. You
need to know what exercising, what conditioning you should be
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier that diagnosis is made, the more hope there is for
living well into old age with even the most crippling forms.
</P>
<P>
   For example, only in the past few years have experts recommended
very early, aggressive treatment for rheumatoid arthritis with
disease-modifying drugs such as methotrexate (first developed for
cancer treatment).
</P>
<P>
   The National Institutes of Health reported last month that
arthritis is now the leading cause of disability among Americans
older than 15, as measured by federal disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of aging baby boomers and the growing number of
children who have the disease put arthritis ahead of heart disease,
the leading cause of disability payments in a similar study in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   More than $65 billion a year in Social Security disability
payments goes to the 21 million arthritis sufferers who are unable
to work because of their disease, according to the Arthritis
Foundation. In comparison, about $50 billion a year in disability
payments goes to 17 million heart disease patients.

LEAVE THE DRIVING TO THE SENIOR SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Murray Wallace checked over his coolers of ice
and dry ice and his clipboard filled with lab reports, grabbed his
car keys and headed for the freeway.
</P>
<P>
   It's the routine the 79-year-old Woodland Hills man follows
three days a week as a courier for Endocrine Sciences, an Agoura
Hills medical research and testing laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   He's one of a dozen of the company's part-time drivers _ all of
them over 60 years old and a few pushing 80 _ who negotiate the
freeways throughout Southern Calfornia, retrieving blood and tissue
samples from doctors' offices and hospitals. After testing is
complete, the drivers deliver lab reports that can provide a
reassuring diagnosis for a worried patient _ or lead doctors to the
right course of treatment for a newborn baby with a
life-threatening condition.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement? These guys have been there, done that. And they
didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, for example, went back to work 2{ years ago after
ending a 40-year career selling maps and globes _ and getting bored
sitting around the house. His part-time job gives him a reason to
get up in the morning, a sense of responsibility, a feeling that
he's helping somebody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I've been told what I was delivering could save
somebody's life,'' Wallace said. ``It's a good feeling that the job
you're doing is that important.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many companies are pushing older employees into
retirement or downsizing them out of a job, it's these older
drivers' maturity, self-reliance and reliability that make them
valuable employees, said Endocrine Sciences operations manager
Kevin Crane.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're an amazing crew,'' he said. ``The only problem I've
had with them is that they'd be here at 5 o'clock in the morning if
I'd let them. Everybody should have that problem, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Reliable, sure. But what about their driving skills?
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Jan and Dean recorded ``The Little Old Lady (From
Pasadena),'' the stereotypical older driver has been either ``the
terror of Colorado Boulevard'' from the song or the poky codger
doing a tentative 20 mph in the freeway's fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   But not these couriers, their boss says. Besides undergoing an
interview, during which their alertness and agility were
scrutinized, each had to submit state Department of Motor Vehicles
proof that they were safe drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our insurance company is not going to insure somebody who's
not,'' Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   The dozen couriers combined drive more than 200,000 miles a
year, and _ although they've had occasional fender-benders _ have
racked up only a fraction of the accidents and other problems
caused by younger drivers the company employed in the past. They
take such good care of company vehicles, in fact, that most autos
are still operating well when the odometers hit 200,000 miles,
Crane said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old firm _ perhaps the only one in the state that
has a staff of senior-citizen drivers, according to California
Department of Aging spokeswoman Jo Raysbrook _ began hiring older
couriers just a few years after it opened for business, after
younger drivers _ most of them in their 20s and 30s _ wrecked cars,
didn't show up for work, failed to deliver samples on time or made
other major mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we had younger drivers, we had repair bills like crazy _
worn brakes, burnt-out clutches,'' Crane said. ``Older drivers,
we've found, are much better drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   The last young driver the firm employed ``got into a running
yelling match with another driver, driving crazy and flipping him
off,'' Crane said. The man was fired after only a few days on the
job.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Crane said he's careful to advertise for ``mature, reliable
people with good driving records.'' Most applicants are older
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't just hire older drivers,'' said sales manager Ron
Darrow. ``That would be discrimination. But we're looking for
people who are reliable and have experience _ and these older guys
are it.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior-citizen couriers, who earn $6.50 to $11 per hour, say
the job gives them some extra money as well as a way to feel
useful, to be outdoors, to be pretty much on their own. And it's
very different from the way they earned a living for years.
</P>
<P>
   David Bullock, 63, of Woodland Hills said he's had a lot more
fun being a driver the past five years than he had teaching
chemistry and biology to indifferent students at Taft High School,
a job he retired from nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   And Peter Smart, 68, of Calabasas said the courier job he's held
for three years, since retiring as a program manager for Litton,
leaves him plenty of time to play golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part-time, and it's easy,'' he said. ``And there's nobody
to supervise you, and you don't have to explain anything to
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Butler, 73, is glad to demonstrate that older workers can
be a boon to a company.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of companies are realizing that just because
somebody's 65, it doesn't mean he should be put in the trash,''
said the Chatsworth man, who's been a medical courier for eight
years, since retiring from overlapping careers as a motorcycle
salesman (15 years) and an auto mechanic (25 years).
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he and the other drivers offer what no young person
can _ a lifetime of experience, which gives them good judgment, and
an awareness of their own mortality, which keeps them from taking
unnecessary chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think older people make fewer errors because they take their
time,'' he said. ``When you're a kid, you think you're going to
live forever. When you're older, you don't have much life left to
live, so you want to make the most of it. You're a lot more
careful.''

SENIORS NEED TO ASSESS SKILLS BEFORE CONTINUING TO DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROL BIDWELL 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just how safe are senior drivers, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Many, as Endocrine Sciences has found, perform well behind the
wheel. But, according to the state Department of Motor Vehicles,
seniors overall are becoming responsible for more and more
accidents.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for that may be simply because, with baby boomers
nationwide turning 50 at the rate of one every nine seconds, there
are more older drivers than ever before on the highways, the DMV
says.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the most recent year for which figures were available,
drivers 65 and over numbered more than 2.4 million, or about 12
percent of the state's 20.3 million licensed drivers. Teen-age
drivers _ who traditionally have had the highest accident rates _
totaled less than 1 million, or about 3.9 percent of the state's
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, 7.1 percent of drivers in fatal and injury
collisions were age 65 or older; in 1981, only 4.9 percent of
drivers involved in serious accidents were 65-plus. During the same
period, the number of drivers age 16 to 19 involved in fatal or
injury crashes declined from 14.6 percent to 10.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, accident rates are high for teens, then
start dipping as drivers mature until about age 70, when drivers
are more likely to cause or be involved in an accident, according
to the DMV.
</P>
<P>
   ``By age 85, men have, on average, a rate of fault in fatal
collisions 149 percent higher than all drivers; the rate for women
in this age group averages 87 percent higher than all drivers,''
said a DMV report on younger and older drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Is there an age when we should simply hang up our car keys and
send our cars to that great used car lot in the sky?
</P>
<P>
   Not for all of us, said William Madison III, DMV spokesman. Some
drivers remain alert, their reflexes and eyesight sharp, all their
lives, he said. Others, due to illness, prescription medication or
loss of mental or visual acuity, become a hazard on the road.
</P>
<P>
   The law recognizes that drivers' ability can diminish with age.
</P>
<P>
   When Californians reach age 70, they're no longer eligible to
have their driver's licenses renewed by mail; they must go to a DMV
office and take a written test and an eye test. If DMV examiners
notice shaking hands, a lack of alertness or anything else that
makes them suspect a loss of driving ability, they can also require
a person to complete a driving test.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we don't discriminate just because of a person's age,''
Madison said. ``If you come in and are lucid and alert and have a
good driving record, you're treated just like everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not unusual for a family member, a friend, a police officer
or a doctor to write the DMV and recommend that an older person's
driving privilege be revoked because the writer feels the older
driver poses a danger behind the wheel, Madison said. But no record
is kept of how many such requests are made annually, or how many
are granted or rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Seniors who want to improve their driving can call the American
Association of Retired Persons Los Angeles office for information
on local 55 Alive/Mature Driving Program classes held in
communities throughout Southern California. Cost of the class is
$8.

MICHELANGELO'S HEARTBREAK COMES TO LIFE IN NEW LIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL SPECTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy _ He was a sick old man when he started the
monumental project, unable to climb stairs without pain. Often, he
could not work. But at some point in the middle of the 1540s
Michelangelo began carving what many art historians regard as his
most mature and provocative sculpture, the piece now known as the
Florentine Pieta.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture was enormous _ nearly eight feet tall _ and
Michelangelo's friend and best-known biographer, Georgio Vasari,
wrote that the artist worked on it only at night. It was an
intensely personal effort. The largest of the four figures,
Nicodemus, is a heart-breaking self portrait of a suffering old
man.
</P>
<P>
   To see what he was doing, the artist fashioned for himself a
sort of 16th-century miner's lamp _ a paper hat with a notch cut
into it to hold a burning candle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to speak of its beauty and sorrow,'' wrote
the historian Ascanio Condivi, upon seeing the work at the time,
``of the grieving and sad faces of them all, especially of the
grieving Mother. Let it suffice: I tell you it is a rare thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody who saw it had any other opinion. Michelangelo intended
the statue for the top of his own tomb. But one day, without a word
of explanation and after a decade of brutal labor and emotional
pain, the artist took a sledgehammer to it.
</P>
<P>
   He broke away hands and arms and legs and nearly destroyed the
work before one of his most devoted servants dragged him away.
Eventually it was patched together by one of his less talented
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did he do it?'' asks Dr. Jack V. Wasserman, professor
emeritus of art history at Temple University, echoing a question
that has tormented researchers for four centuries. ``What was it
that happened that led him to break apart one of his greatest works
of art?''
</P>
<P>
   The usual answers _ that Michelangelo was a perfectionist, that
he was enraged by discovering flaws in the marble, that he was
angered by a mistake in his composition _ do not really satisfy
anybody. So at the request of Wasserman, who is preparing a lengthy
book on the Pieta to be published this year by Princeton University
Press, a team from the visual- and geometric-computing department
at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.,
decided to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists, armed with special photography equipment,
lasers, X-ray machines and the most powerful computers in America,
will try to help resolve one of the most intriguing mysteries of
Renaissance art. But it will not be an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many problems here that I realized I would never
solve by normal means,'' Wasserman said. ``I wanted to be able to
move the statue, to take it apart, to see it the way it was when
Michelangelo broke it up. How was I ever going to accomplish any of
that?'' In addition, Wasserman said he wanted to be able to look at
the statue's individual parts and understand what it looked like
before the broken pieces were put back on.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a special visual shape camera called a Virtuoso,
the IBM researchers are compiling the most complete digital
documentary ever attempted of any sculpture. Using the camera,
which was originally designed for plastic surgeons to take
three-dimensional photographs, scientists were able to take
thousands of accurate 3-D pictures of every millimeter of the
gargantuan statue.
</P>
<P>
   The camera works by taking several pictures of images at the
same time from slightly different perspectives, creating something
like a three-dimensional map of the area. Thousands of maps are
made and then they are merged with the help of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The camera also takes color pictures at different distances and
in varying light. They too are blended by computer. Working at
night when the statue's permanent home, the Museo dell'Opera del
Duomo, is closed, the team has so far assembled more than 10
million data points _ essentially digital recollections of parts of
the statue _ that will be merged to create with astonishing
fidelity the complex contours of the chiseled stone.
</P>
<P>
   The team has collected enough data to fill 8 gigabytes of hard
disk space _ four times the size of a normal hard disk in today's
average computer. When they are done, the researchers will have
gathered at least 80 gigabytes of information needed to create an
image of the statue.
</P>
<P>
   That is actually the easy part. Creating a program that will
allow the picture to be compressed enough so that it can be placed
on the Internet, and made available to millions of people, might
prove far more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see some nice three-dimensional graphics,'' said Gabriel
Taubin, the manager of the visual research team at IBM. ``But not
on this scale. To recreate something as complicated as this statue
is an extremely difficult research problem. To merge thousands and
thousands of pictures into something that gives the appropriate
sense of space and shape and contour is really very hard to do. And
then to make it approachable by anyone who wants it, well, that's
our goal.''

BOOTING UP VIRTUAL STARS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Soon, very soon maybe, Marlene Dietrich will slink
across the screen again, and W.C. Fields will crack his
misanthropic jokes at trade shows. And a stoic Abe Lincoln could be
explaining the Civil War to museumgoers or cavorting in a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   No, this isn't Buddhist reincarnation come to the entertainment
world. And it's not another clever use of recycled film-clip
cutouts, like those of John Wayne and Fred Astaire in recent beer
and vacuum cleaner commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It's new computer technology that soon should be good enough to
resurrect the dead with lifelike three-dimensional re-creations
convincing enough for computer screens, television, games, museum
exhibits, trade shows, even movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're approaching (an image good enough for) a medium close-up
for a big theater screen of a virtual character where you couldn't
tell it was computerized,'' said Steve Sherer, CEO of Sherer
Digital Animation, whose recent works include a digital Humphrey
Bogart and a virtual Lincoln that reminds of nothing so much as the
well-known audio-animatronic figure at Disneyland's exhibition
devoted to America's 16th president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're right on the edge of being able to show it,''
Sherer said. ``Within the year, we'll see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, an interactive W.C. Fields character has been shown off
recently at a New York licensing show and at a Universal City
conference on digital humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's OK, but it's not 100 percent,'' said Sandra Kay Helsel,
the conference's director and U.S. editor of VR News. ``There's
still a gap.'`
</P>
<P>
   But the gap is shrinking, quickly, Helsel said. And as it does,
people are now seriously considering how to apply the virtual
technology to the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying now is, how do we use this?'' Helsel said.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility: the Michael Keaton movie ``Multiplicity'' gone
slightly mad, as big stars use ``digital clones'' to be two places
at once, experts said. A good example would be if Michael Jordan
wanted to appear at a trade show in Los Angeles while the NBA
playoffs were running in Chicago. With digital technology, he could
``appear'' at the show while coming off a pick for a big
three-point shot.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another possibility, said Greg Panos of the Performance
Animation Society, is that the technology will ultimately create a
new class of faceless yet famous performers, like the anonymous
Fields impersonator.
</P>
<P>
   Panos said they will be as ``famous as the digital character
they play. They might be very big, but they can go shopping without
being accosted. There will be a whole new class of digital actors
who will become as famous as real actors.''
</P>
<P>
   The digital Fields can interact with an audience and moderator,
cracking jokes, looking at individual questioners and twirling a
cigar.
</P>
<P>
   The character is controlled by a Fields impersonator working
from behind a screen, Oz-like, with motion-capture sensors attached
to his face that send commands to a computer directing the
on-screen character, said Jeffrey Lotman, CEO of Virtual Celebrity
Productions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part that's a little sad is when you're not going to be
able to tell the difference,'' said Lotman. ``But we can create a
Mikey (of Life cereal fame) that would never grow up, a Mr. Whipple
(of Charmin tissue ads) that would never die, and most importantly,
there would be new performances of our classic performers.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Riva, who runs an intellectual property brokerage, would
like to include Dietrich, his grandmother, in that list of
perpetual performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in this room has any different relationship with
Marlene Dietrich now than they did 10 years ago,'' said Riva. ``For
all intents and purposes, she's still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Riva said, she would be virtually alive, too.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to boil down a Berlin archive _ containing truckloads
of his grandmother's papers, films, still photos and audio
recordings _ into a ``digital playbook'' for the computerized
artificial intelligence that would govern a virtual Dietrich
performing in new movies.
</P>
<P>
   But true artificial intelligence, sought for decades by
researchers, remains far in the future, several experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're way far away from a digital computer that can think and
interact with people on its own,'' Sherer said.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearer term, however, characters like the Fields one _
combining high-quality animation technology with motion-capture
technology _ will allow celebrities to create a more enduring image
of themselves, Lotman said. They'll be able to perform decades past
their prime, or even their life, Lotman said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Masur, president of the Screen Actors Guild, said the
technology shouldn't threaten his group's members, and it may even
expand their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I quarrel with is that there will be characters
created that will replace humans,'' Masur said. ``It isn't going to
happen, or it may, but isn't going to be successful. People go to
movies to see people they can make contact with.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be so sure about that connection thing, however. At
another recent conference at the American Film Institute in Los
Feliz, software gurus were showing clips of an !ital!idoru!off!,
the Japanese word for a virtual idol.
</P>
<P>
   Kyoko Date, the idoru's name, was created for an advertising
agency in Japan and has become hugely popular there, said Garry
Hare, president of Oz Interactive Inc., whose program animates
Kyoko Date to perform on the Internet, television and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Kyoko Date is hugely popular in Japan, even selling several hit
songs under her/its name, Hare said. She/It gets 200 marriage
proposals a week.
</P>
<P>
   Something of a similar phenomenon is occurring in the United
States with Lara Croft, the animated star of two Tomb Raider
computer games that now is being used in a feature film.
</P>
<P>
   But those characters are different from virtual celebrities,
which Masur said are unlikely to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bless your heart, but I think you're doomed to mediocrity,''
Masur said to researchers. ``I don't believe there's going to be a
lot of Marlene Dietrichs in the future, because what made her
memorable was ineffable. The fact is, when actors work, all kinds
of things are taking place, accidents happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, even when an actor has little talent, ``they're
absolutely riveting,'' Masur said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it possible, under the 100 monkeys theory, that you could
create a character that's riveting?'' Masur said. ``It's possible.
In the short term, it probably would be interesting. But in terms
of carrying a film, I don't think so. Human performers bring things
to performances. You will have cut out a rich source of
collaboration.''
</P>
<P>
   Hare agreed with Masur, even though his company is busy trying
to create compelling virtual characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of bringing W.C. Fields back to life, I don't know,''
Hare said. ``You do it once or twice, then who cares? If you're
doing an animated film, do an animated film.''
</P>
<P>
   Real stars have an important place in film, Hare said, and not
just for their performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want real stars so they can go out and bang the drum and
promote a movie,'' Hare said. Resurrecting long-dead stars isn't
``a compelling use of the technology. A lot of times we use
technology because we can, not because we should.''
</P>
<P>
   Helsel, an anthropologist, said too much emphasis is being put
on technology, and not enough on the social-science implications of
virtual humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They haven't gotten into the soul, but can you?'' Helsel
asked. ``They'll never be able to get the soul into these
characters.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many current celebrities are having their faces and
figures scanned into computers in anticipation of a virtual career,
said Steve Williams, an Oscar-nominated special effects supervisor
for films such as ``Spawn,'' ``The Mask'' and ``Jurassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I kept hearing was synthetic actors would never
happen, it's not right,'' said Williams. ``But it seems to me even
saying that implies that it will exist. Synthetic humans are
inevitable. I think it's a shame in a way, but it will happen.''

 FLORENCE: our goal.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wasserman has a different goal. He wants to understand the
statue _ and he wants to be able to see it from every possible
angle. Once the IBM team finishes its work, it should be possible
to look at it with the arms and legs missing and perhaps see what
Michelangelo was up to.
</P>
<P>
   It will be possible to look at the monument as if it were on top
of an altar or tomb, as the artist had intended. Most important, it
will be easy to manipulate the model of the massive block of stone
_ and to vary the light conditions under which it is seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am an art historian,'' Wasserman said. ``And, of course,
seeing the work is what matters. But I also believe that we have to
document the art. That means using every tool at our disposal to
find out what is known.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no computer program, no feat of technical
virtuosity or sophistication that could possibly compare to being
in the room with the Pieta. It is hulking and tragic and dominates
the space allotted to it here.
</P>
<P>
   Every statue is a unique collection of shapes, but this Pieta is
particularly complex. A computer model might let a viewer get a
glimpse inside the head of the artist. One of Christ's legs is
still missing. It has been suggested that the only place it could
have fit in the composition is draped over the Virgin.
</P>
<P>
   And that might have pushed Michelangelo beyond what he and his
church regarded as the bounds of decency. With the IBM model, it
will not be difficult to add a virtual leg or to see what sort of
statue would have come from it had Michelangelo done the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   It will also now be easier to see the parts of this monument in
a new way, and that could allow experts to see the work itself as
never before. There is also a danger, cited by Wasserman and many
other art historians. Even if the computer can ``fix'' and
embellish art, it cannot reproduce it. There will always be only
one Florentine Pieta, no matter how useful or important is virtual
offspring may become.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a profoundly moving and rich reflection of the times
in which it was created, ``said Msgr. Timothy Verdon, who is head
of cultural programs for the Roman Catholic Church in Florence and
a historian who has written a chapter, to be included in
Wasserman's book, about the religious significance of the statue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the three Pietas that he did, this is the most complex, the
most interesting. It is the one that still has the power to move
people to prayer.''
</P>
<P>
   So, could understanding one of what Verdon calls ``the great
works of his old age, one of the great works of the Renaissance,''
be aided by the use of fancy technology from the late 20th century?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how,'' he replied with a bemused smile. ``I'm not
a Luddite by any means and I appreciate what Jack is trying to do.
I certainly respect his work. But you can look at a model forever
and you won't see what is in this room.''
</P>
<P>
   But sculpture is unlike other medium. Although people tend to
look at it as if it were a painting, a sculpture is really a
continuous series of contours, as Leonardo da Vinci first pointed
out. Changing the point of view _ where somebody stands when he
looks at the statue _ changes the meaning of many sculptures, and
the type of imaging that IBM is doing will make it possible for
many points of view to be available to anyone interested in this
work of art.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is reason for caution,'' said Dr. Kathleen Weil-Garris
Brandt, professor of fine arts at New York University and the
permanent consultant for Renaissance arts to the Vatican museums.
``After all, 20th-century physics has taught us that the way we
measure something determines its `reality.' And with computers,
there is often a sense that since it's science it must be true. We
need to remember that a computer image is just a computer image. It
is not the art.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``But this kind of work is extremely important. The
way we look at art has a great deal to do with the way we are able
to look at it. Art history today is in some ways the creation of
photography. Today there just wouldn't be much art history without
photography. So we can see now the beginning of something new and
valuable. Three-D imagery is likely to shape our notions of
visuality and of the third dimension in ways that we cannot yet
foresee.''

OWNERSHIP FUZZY IN DIGITAL WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With the gap between the computerized world and
the real one shrinking quickly, the implications of virtual actors
become more interesting. And so do the accompanying problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as you can kidnap real people to make money, you can
kidnap virtual people to make money,'' said Joseph Beard, a St.
John's University law professor who specializes in intellectual
property issues.
</P>
<P>
   By kidnapping, Beard means swiping the virtual re-creation of a
person, living or dead, and using it for profit. And that will get
easier and easier the more powerful and accessible the technology
becomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawyers tend to lag (behind) technology,'' said Beard. ``I
really thought we would have longer than we do have. But the
technology's really taken off. The goal is to be indistinguishable
from real life.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, Swiss researcher Nadia Thalmann's MIRALab at the
University of Geneva can take two digitized photographs of a person
and spit out a pretty good 3-D computer copy that talks and makes
appropriate facial gestures and interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Given the burgeoning business of celebrity porn on the Internet,
particularly where a star's face is digitally pasted onto someone
else's nude body, the implications for digital theft can be
dizzying, and troubling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm W.C. (Field)'s grandson,'' said Ronald Fields, a
television writer whose grandfather has been rendered into a
digital character that cracks jokes, looks at questioners and
twirls his cigar. ``He's a real guy in our family. I feel, even if
I were a teetotaler, a Mormon, and Southern Comfort came and wanted
to do a commercial with him, I'd say yes because that was his
image. But if someone wanted to do a nude poster, I'd stop it.
That's my grandfather. I want to protect his image.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Rosenthal, who represents many celebrities' estates in
trying to stop improper use of their images, said copyright and
trademark laws are far from clear in what can be done to stop
digital kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   Great Britain and New York have virtually no prohibitions on the
use of a dead celebrity's image, Rosenthal said. California gives
the estate control for 50 years, while Indiana has a tough 100-year
rule and other restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to happen,'' Beard said. ``If an
unscrupulous producer can take a couple of on-line stills and marry
them to a body double to make a porn flick, they will. The same
thing with overseas piracy of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   But Beard and others said serious work needs to be done to
update laws governing intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the laws were created with the analog world in mind, and
now we're dealing with the digital world,'' Beard said. ``I
personally think the laws need some tweaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The laws assume, for instance, that once a celebrity is dead,
his or her works are ``frozen in time; no more films will be
made,'' Beard said. ``Now, that's no longer the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The current widely differing patchwork of state laws begs for
some national legislation providing ``sufficient postmortem
protection,'' Beard said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I have is you can only control this so much,''
Fields said. ``There are thieves out there, and it is going to
happen, and we have to try to stop them.''

<P>
   Chances are, you or someone you know has arthritis. It affects
one in every seven Americans of all ages, including children. It is
more prevalent among older people who have years of wear and tear
on their joints.
</P>
<P>
   Warning signs include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Pain
</P>
<P>
   _ Stiffness
</P>
<P>
   _ Occasional swelling
</P>
<P>
   If you have any of these signs in and around joints for more
than two weeks, it's time to see your doctor, the Arthritis
Foundation says.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to tell the doctor where it hurts, when it hurts, when
it first began to hurt, how long it has hurt, if you have seen any
swelling, what daily tasks are hard to do now, if you ever injured
the joint in an accident or overused it on the job or in a hobby
and if anyone else in your family has had a similar problem.

MICHELANGELO'S HEARTBREAK COMES TO LIFE IN NEW LIGHT

 By MICHAEL SPECTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLORENCE, Italy _ He was a sick old man when he started the
monumental project, unable to climb stairs without pain. Often, he
could not work. But at some point in the middle of the 1540s
Michelangelo began carving what many art historians regard as his
most mature and provocative sculpture, the piece now known as the
Florentine Pieta.
</P>
<P>
   The sculpture was enormous _ nearly eight feet tall _ and
Michelangelo's friend and best-known biographer, Georgio Vasari,
wrote that the artist worked on it only at night. It was an
intensely personal effort. The largest of the four figures,
Nicodemus, is a heart-breaking self portrait of a suffering old
man.
</P>
<P>
   To see what he was doing, the artist fashioned for himself a
sort of 16th-century miner's lamp _ a paper hat with a notch cut
into it to hold a burning candle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is impossible to speak of its beauty and sorrow,'' wrote
the historian Ascanio Condivi, upon seeing the work at the time,
``of the grieving and sad faces of them all, especially of the
grieving Mother. Let it suffice: I tell you it is a rare thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody who saw it had any other opinion. Michelangelo intended
the statue for the top of his own tomb. But one day, without a word
of explanation and after a decade of brutal labor and emotional
pain, the artist took a sledgehammer to it.
</P>
<P>
   He broke away hands and arms and legs and nearly destroyed the
work before one of his most devoted servants dragged him away.
Eventually it was patched together by one of his less talented
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did he do it?'' asks Dr. Jack V. Wasserman, professor
emeritus of art history at Temple University, echoing a question
that has tormented researchers for four centuries. ``What was it
that happened that led him to break apart one of his greatest works
of art?''
</P>
<P>
   The usual answers _ that Michelangelo was a perfectionist, that
he was enraged by discovering flaws in the marble, that he was
angered by a mistake in his composition _ do not really satisfy
anybody. So at the request of Wasserman, who is preparing a lengthy
book on the Pieta to be published this year by Princeton University
Press, a team from the visual- and geometric-computing department
at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, N.Y.,
decided to get involved.
</P>
<P>
   Now scientists, armed with special photography equipment,
lasers, X-ray machines and the most powerful computers in America,
will try to help resolve one of the most intriguing mysteries of
Renaissance art. But it will not be an easy task.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many problems here that I realized I would never
solve by normal means,'' Wasserman said. ``I wanted to be able to
move the statue, to take it apart, to see it the way it was when
Michelangelo broke it up. How was I ever going to accomplish any of
that?'' In addition, Wasserman said he wanted to be able to look at
the statue's individual parts and understand what it looked like
before the broken pieces were put back on.
</P>
<P>
   Working with a special visual shape camera called a Virtuoso,
the IBM researchers are compiling the most complete digital
documentary ever attempted of any sculpture. Using the camera,
which was originally designed for plastic surgeons to take
three-dimensional photographs, scientists were able to take
thousands of accurate 3-D pictures of every millimeter of the
gargantuan statue.
</P>
<P>
   The camera works by taking several pictures of images at the
same time from slightly different perspectives, creating something
like a three-dimensional map of the area. Thousands of maps are
made and then they are merged with the help of the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The camera also takes color pictures at different distances and
in varying light. They too are blended by computer. Working at
night when the statue's permanent home, the Museo dell'Opera del
Duomo, is closed, the team has so far assembled more than 10
million data points _ essentially digital recollections of parts of
the statue _ that will be merged to create with astonishing
fidelity the complex contours of the chiseled stone.
</P>
<P>
   The team has collected enough data to fill 8 gigabytes of hard
disk space _ four times the size of a normal hard disk in today's
average computer. When they are done, the researchers will have
gathered at least 80 gigabytes of information needed to create an
image of the statue.
</P>
<P>
   That is actually the easy part. Creating a program that will
allow the picture to be compressed enough so that it can be placed
on the Internet, and made available to millions of people, might
prove far more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see some nice three-dimensional graphics,'' said Gabriel
Taubin, the manager of the visual research team at IBM. ``But not
on this scale. To recreate something as complicated as this statue
is an extremely difficult research problem. To merge thousands and
thousands of pictures into something that gives the appropriate
sense of space and shape and contour is really very hard to do. And
then to make it approachable by anyone who wants it, well, that's
our goal.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Wasserman has a different goal. He wants to understand the
statue _ and he wants to be able to see it from every possible
angle. Once the IBM team finishes its work, it should be possible

measure something determines its `reality.' And with computers,
there is often a sense that since it's science it must be true. We
need to remember that a computer image is just a computer image. It
is not the art.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``But this kind of work is extremely important. The
way we look at art has a great deal to do with the way we are able
to look at it. Art history today is in some ways the creation of
photography. Today there just wouldn't be much art history without
photography. So we can see now the beginning of something new and
valuable. Three-D imagery is likely to shape our notions of
visuality and of the third dimension in ways that we cannot yet
foresee.''

`KELLY LOVES TONY' PERSONALIZES ART 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
KELLY LOVES TONY 
Produced and directed by: Spencer Nakasako 
On: PBS 
Date: Tuesday6/30at 10 p.m. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When A-student Kelly Saeteurn graduates from high school, she's
already pregnant by her 22-year-old boyfriend Tony Saelio. But
she's resourceful and optimistic, set on marrying the ex-gang
member and school droput, Tony, going to college, and attaining her
dreams of success, American-style.
</P>
<P>
   Thus begins ``Kelly Loves Tony,'' a highly personal, rawly
crafted video diary covering 18 months in their strained and
culturally divided life. Kelly and Tony are both Iu Mien, a Laotion
hill tribe, but have grown up in Oakland, Calif., straddling
American society and their families' tribal traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Their story, full of potential drama and revelation that is too
rarely realized, will be aired Tuesday at 10 p.m. as part of the
independent non-fiction PBS film series, ``P.O.V.''
</P>
<P>
   Supplied with a camcorder by director Spencer Nakasako, the
young couple shot the video themselves. The advantage of the
approach is an intimacy and occasional honesty, especially when
Kelly's alone addressing the unmanned camera, perhaps otherwise
unattainable.
</P>
<P>
   In one monologue, Kelly, whose cheer and grit begin to ebb after
she moves in with Tony's big, demanding family, vents her
frustration. She has been caring for her infant, laboring for the
family's approval so she can marry Tony, commuting to a community
college, and worrying about Tony's possible deportation to Laos.
``It's like 10 loads of dirty laundry,'' she says, ``and it all
piles up, and I have to finish it in two hours.'' The homeliness of
Kelly's metaphor and her easy, striking directness cut to the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   But assigning this couple to shoot all their own video footage
has almost overwhelming disadvantages. The most obvious is that,
while Kelly and Tony separately interrogate each other from behind
the camera, they can't both interact visually (or very easily,
since one of them is always filming). This is, at best, a
cumbersome way to dramatize the documentary's central relationship;
at worst, impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Tony, whose speech can often barely be understood, has
little feel for using the camera. For example, on his way to work
at a local Asian youth center, he films the sidewalk while
typically mumbling his narration.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, there's pathos in his awkwardness, which can perhaps
be read as pained self-consciousness, and in his stilted
declarations of love for his ``dream lady'' and infant son. But
Tony doesn't grow or change, and while his underdevelopment is part
of this sad chronicle, it is also a large part of its undoing. On
camera and behind it, Tony, the film's ``co-star'' if you will, is
neither interesting nor dynamic.
</P>
<P>
   This could have, perhaps should have, been a searing story of
young lives overwhelmed, hopes tragically smothered. But neither
the director nor the camcorder couple can fully awaken, much less
shape, their dormant narrative or its promising themes about
immigration and the American Dream.
</P>
<P>
   It takes art to universalize personal experience _ without it,
banality beckons.

CALIFORNIA BAR DUMPS INVESTIGATIVE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Californians who feel cheated or neglected by
their lawyer now have only one recourse: Get another lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a political fight in the state capital, the State Bar
of California has cut all but 20 of the 283 employees who
investigate consumer complaints against attorneys and who prosecute
bad lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 140,000 attorneys in the state of California _ more
than any other country _ and now there is no oversight and no
disciplinary process,'' said Clothilde Hewlett, one of the few bar
employees who was not terminated Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Now the only way consumers can get back at an attorney who
cheats them is to find another lawyer willing to sue for
malpractice or take the case to a district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   The bar receives about 140,000 complaints a year and opens files
on 15,000 cases. The vast majority do not end in discipline, said
Steven Nissen, State Bar executive director. But the mere existence
of a complaint often leads to the parties working out their
differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we're not opening any new cases,'' Nissen said. ``There's
no buffer for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   There will no longer be a hot line for consumers _ a person can
only mail a written complaint to the State Bar, Nissen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the staff to investigate it; we'll time-stamp it
and warehouse it'' until some undetermined future time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Gov. Pete Wilson vetoed funding for the State Bar,
calling it bloated, arrogant and too political. Since then,
legislators have been unable to craft a deal to authorize the
agency to continue collecting annual license fees from the state's
lawyers, the agency's primary source of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has presented a reasonable offer that allows for
the continuous operation of the State Bar and protects the judicial
evaluation and discipline process,'' Wilson spokesman Ron Low said.
``As we have stated from the beginning, we are willing to listen to
reasonable proposals from the Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   The laid-off State Bar investigators said the general public
does not care about squabbles in Sacramento. But they want to see
attorneys, who have the power to interpret and possibly manipulate
the law, regulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel like I've provided a valuable service to the
public and it's the people of California who are the real losers
here,'' said J.D. Pickering, who spent 12 years investigating
complaints against attorneys. ``I love this work. I think the
people of California will be worse off without us.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could give exact numbers, but it is believed that only a
handful of attorneys have been prosecuted in criminal courts for
cheating clients.
</P>
<P>
   Membership in the bar is mandatory but many attorneys are
uncomfortable that their dues have been used for lobbying and
political advocacy. Wilson spokesman Sean Walsh said recently that
every time the governor gets on a plane, ``every lawyer gets on a
conga line to high-five him for his efforts to reform the (State)
Bar.''
</P>
<P>
   The State Bar asked the state Supreme Court earlier this week to
grant an interim order that would immediately have set attorneys'
licensing fees at $364 for 1998, but the court denied the request
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wilson's veto, the State Bar collected $458 per year from
each attorney to pay for most of its $61 million annual budget. But
critics have noted the annual fee is more than twice the national
average, which they say is too high.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's issues with the State Bar date back to at least 1982
when, as a U.S. Senate candidate, he was censured by a bar group
for threatening to lead a recall of the state Supreme Court if it
overturned a crime initiative. More recently, the Republican
governor got angry when a bar commission that evaluates candidates
for the bench gave an unqualified rating to his most recent Supreme
Court nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a month ago, Wilson announced his terms for saving the
State Bar. Among them: reducing dues to $295 per year and
transforming the policy-making board into a body appointed by the
governor. Wilson said the State Bar's functions should be limited
to admissions, discipline and education.

NAME THAT NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 5.)  
 (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
 (HLW)  
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On this Independence Day weekend, it is fitting and timely to
ask: Who coined the name  &UR; United States of America &LR; ?
</P>
<P>
   In the year before independence, many in the colonies went with
the name used by Benjamin Franklin in his July 1775 draft of an
articles of confederation:  &UR; United Colonies of North America &LR; .
Another name, however, most famously appeared in print on July 4,
1776, in the Declaration of Independence, which was drafted by a
committee that assigned the task to Thomas Jefferson: its last
paragraph referred to ``the Representatives of the United States of
America, in General Congress Assembled.''
</P>
<P>
   In our first exploration of this mystery a few months ago, it
was reported that the widely accepted Jefferson coinage (written by
Young Tom between June 11 and June 28, 1776) might have been
antedated by two other citations: the first in a letter from
Continental Congress member Elbridge Gerry to Gen. Horatio Gates
dated June 25, and the second in a letter to The Pennsylvania
Evening Post published on June 29, from the pseudonymous writer
``Republicus.''
</P>
<P>
   This is important; it's our country we're talking about, and we
ought to try to pin down its namer. Two letters have come pouring
in. One is from a biographer of Thomas Paine, Professor Jack
Fruchtman Jr., of Towson University, in Maryland, who insists that
Paine's usage two years after the Declaration in his widely read
``American Crisis'' publicized the name. Call me a summer soldier
or sunshine patriot, but common sense tells me that a popularizer
is not a coiner.
</P>
<P>
   Comes now Ronald Gephart, last of the editors of the Library of
Congress' 25-volume ``Letters of Delegates to Congress,
1774-1789.'' He searched his new CD-ROM of all that correspondence,
then dug around in the Journals of the Continental Congress, and
alerted me to his findings just in time for the nation's 222nd
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Henry Lee of Virginia was the Founder who made the
motion on June 7, 1776, to declare ``that these United Colonies
are, and of right ought to be, free and independent States.'' His
resolution led to the formation of three committees: one, starring
Jefferson and John Adams, to draft a declaration of independence;
another, including John Dickenson, the conservative Pennsylvanian,
and Roger Sherman, to draft articles of confederation, and a third,
including Dickenson, Adams, and Franklin, to draft a treaty plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three committees began deliberating simultaneously,''
writes Gephart, ``and continued to do so until the end of June.
Jefferson accepted the responsibility for drafting the declaration,
Dickenson the articles, and Adams the treaty plan. But as many as
18 members of the three committees were working together to create
these three fundamental documents in which  &UR; United States of
America &LR;  was used for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   So who came up with the catchy name for which the initials are
not UCNA but USA? We know that Dickenson had by June 17 prepared a
second draft _ all that survives _ of the articles, which includes
the flat statement: ``The name of this Confederation shall be the
` &UR; United States of America &LR; .''' Nothing tentative about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jefferson, on the other hand,'' writes Gephart, ``did not ask
Franklin to review his draft of `A Declaration by the
Representatives of the  &UR; United States of America &LR; ' until June 21.
It is not known when Adams drafted the preamble to the plan of
treaties.''
</P>
<P>
   The historian concludes cautiously: ``The term was first coined
by one or more members during the early deliberations of the three
committees _ between June 11, when Jefferson's committee began
work, and June 17, when it appeared in the second draft of
Dickenson's Articles.''
</P>
<P>
   Coinagists would give the edge to the conciliatory Dickenson
(who refused to sign Jefferson's Declaration), partly because the
first recorded surfacing of the phrase was his, and partly because
he's not as famous as Jefferson and can use the recognition.
</P>
<P>
   I'd still like to see Dickenson's first draft, with date. Keep
looking, historians; it's not as if he were working on a word
processor that obliterates first drafts. It would be of great
interest to all of us here in the good old UCNA, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   CHILLING EFFECT
</P>
<P>
   ``A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints,'' says the
frightened Quintus in Shakespeare's ``Titus Andronicus.'' Such a
flush of fear stimulates the sweat glands, which then cool the skin
with perspiration, metaphorically dampening ardor and freezing
action. In underworld lingo, the verb to chill is to change a warm
body into a cool corpse.
</P>
<P>
   When it was discovered last month that City College of New York
had installed a surveillance camera inside a smoke detector outside
a student meeting room, three graduate students sued the school on
privacy grounds. Brad Sigal, a graduate student, said: ``It
definitely has a  &UR; chilling effect &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   This phrase has now become the great cliche in First Amendment
and libel law. Chief Justice Warren Burger used it 15 times in a
1972 opinion. A  &UR; chilling effect &LR;  is one that intimidates, makes
timorous and turns timid (all from  &UR; timere &LR; , ``to fear'') the
ordinarily gutsy journalist, causing the sin of self-censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Who coined it? Forget early cases about coolants. According to
Bryan Garner, editor of the Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage, the
earliest metaphoric use found so far was in 1899, by
Vice-Chancellor Henry Cooper Pitney, of New Jersey: ``This letter
the wife swears she interpreted as one of intentional
discouragement to her return, and that it had a  &UR; chilling effect &LR; 
on her.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus are we coming up to the centennial of  &UR; chilling effect &LR; .
Break out the very cold Champagne, and toast the phrase good-bye.

BUS CHAT WORTH MORE THAN TOKEN IN TEREST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) - I'm not one of those folks who never met a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   You know the type. They smile easily, laugh loudly and strike up
conversations anywhere _ on airplanes, in grocery stores, even in
the bathroom at the movies.
</P>
<P>
   Like many newspaper and media types, I'm a little shy around
people I don't know. An editor once told me he thought most of us
were, and that's why we go into the business. It forces us to talk
to people, to overcome our aversion to chatting up a total
stranger.
</P>
<P>
   When a deadline looms and you've got to know (begin ital) right
now (end ital) why a person decided to set fire to a row of
oleanders, it tends to increase your assertiveness level
considerably.
</P>
<P>
   I've always admired people who could make that kind of
conversation naturally, even if countless of their number have
annoyed me on airplanes while I tried to nap.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to St. Louis?'' they'll grin, as if more than one answer
were possible. I've always wanted to shriek and bolt from my seat
and start screaming, ``St. Louis? STOP THE PLANE! I thought we were
going to Cleveland!''
</P>
<P>
   It's all a matter of whether being banned by the airline for
life would be worth the look on the person's face.
</P>
<P>
   I came across one of these easy talkers the other day. I had to
run to catch a bus. As I fumbled for change, the driver told me I
needn't have hurried, that she always checks for stragglers before
pulling back into traffic.
</P>
<P>
   She started this train of thought as I paid my fare, and
continued as I took the only available seat, just behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Fair enough, I thought as I nodded. Then she started in with
general chitchat about how traffic wasn't bad for a Friday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   This was casual, bartender-type chatter. I felt no obligation to
do anything more than nod or mumble the occasional ``um-hmm.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, from out of nowhere, she got personal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first day back,'' she said. ``My sister just had
surgery and I had to be there for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The casual eavesdropper would have thought that we were related,
that she was filling me in on how a cousin was faring after an
appendectomy. She talked as if she were resuming a conversation we
had been having minutes before. Only we had never seen each other
in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   We had reached that crucial point. She had engaged me and waited
for a response, even as she made stops for disembarking passengers
and greeted new ones.
</P>
<P>
   This is where I usually drop the ball. If I just sat there and
fidgeted with my glasses or scratched an imaginary itch on my arm
or something, that would be that.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if she knew me. A couple more stops and we would be
done, both gone our separate ways, the story she had tried to start
a pleasant-enough, though fleeting, memory.
</P>
<P>
   But she had been nice and clearly wanted to continue, so I bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is she OK?''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, just what she wanted to hear. She launched into a nearly
perfect spiel about her sister: She caught me up on her condition
(she was OK) without ever actually telling me what exactly was
wrong with her.
</P>
<P>
   She did give some details. She and her sister are identical
twins, she explained. She had donated a couple of pints of blood,
just in case.
</P>
<P>
   This led to a rather touching revelation on her part of how
lucky she felt to have an identical twin, to have a guaranteed
donor on hand, if it came to that.
</P>
<P>
   Other business captured her attention from there. She helped a
man in a wheelchair board the bus and explained routes to a couple
of passengers trying to wend their way to Apache Junction. A
handful of stops later, and I was on my way.
</P>
<P>
   As I walked from my stop, I again thought about how reluctant I
would have been to launch into a conversation like that with a
stranger.
</P>
<P>
   And how glad I was to have run into someone who wasn't. &QL;

 &HT;     TAIWAN _ WHERE A CRISIS IS ALWAYS WAITING TO HAPPEN
 &HT;     With CLINTON-CHINA-MAIN 
 &HT;     For Use Tuesday, June 30 And Thereafter.
 &HT;     By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL

<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ History suggests that Taiwan is the issue most
likely to lead to a world flashpoint between the United States and
China in the 21st Century. And as President Clinton learned Monday
from questioning by students at Beijing University, reunification
with the mainland is an important issue even among young Chinese.
Here is the background:
</P>
<P>
   1885 - Poor Province. The backward, thinly populated island of
Taiwan, or Formosa, becomes a province of imperial China. Most of
the 3 million inhabitants are Malayo-Polynesian ethnics.
</P>
<P>
   1895-1945 - Japanese Colony. Taiwan falls under Japanese
colonial rule. The economy flourishes. Education and income levels
inch upward. As China bogs down in civil war, Taiwan becomes more
developed than the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   1947 - Nationalist Redoubt. China's ruling Nationalist Party
forces are losing the Chinese civil war. They begin retreating to a
military base camp on Taiwan and assert control over the local
population.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 20, 1947 - Taiwan massacre. Local Taiwanese riot against
brutal measures by the mainland newcomers. Some Nationalist Chinese
troops open fire into a Taiwanese crowd, killing many and fostering
decades of resentment.
</P>
<P>
   June 1949 - Promise to Return. Nationalist Chinese leader
Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek retreats to Taiwan but promises to
return some day to take over the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   January 1950 - Crucial Omission. Declarations by the Truman
administration define a new Pacific ``defense perimeter'' that does
not include Taiwan. Truman said the U.S. ``will not provide
military aid or advice to Chinese forces'' on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Summer 1950 - Truman Reversal. With the outbreak of the Korean
war, China transfers a large military force to coastal Fujian
province, 120 miles from Taiwan. Truman decides to protect Taiwan
against a Chinese invasion, and the island becomes an ardent U.S.
ally
</P>
<P>
   1950-55 - On the Brink. Chinese troops shell the
Nationalist-held islands of Quemoy and Matsu, lying within 15 miles
of the Chinese coast. This spawns a running conflict that verges on
U.S.-China war. The U.S. and Nationalist China (Taiwan) sign a
mutual defense treaty.
</P>
<P>
   May 1955 - China Recedes. China decides to let the Nationalists
keep Quemoy and Matsu. With artful ambiguity, Chinese statesman
Zhou Enlai says China will strive to liberate Taiwan ``by peaceful
means so far as it is possible.''
</P>
<P>
   October 1971 - Taiwan Isolated. Diplomatic support for Taiwan
evaporates following news that President Richard Nixon plans a trip
to mainland China. The U.N. General Assembly grants China's U.N.
seat to the mainland government and expels Taiwan delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 28, 1972 - One China. President Nixon finishes historic
visit to China by declaring that ``there is but one China and
Taiwan is part of China.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan 1, 1979 - Breakoff. President Jimmy Carter ``normalizes''
relations with China, which means ending diplomatic recognition
with Taiwan and exchanging ambassadors with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Spring 1979 _ Congress Intervenes. To protect Taiwan, the U.S.
Congress passes the Taiwan Relations Act obligating the U.S. to
defend Taiwan from Chinese aggression. Carter signs the bill in
April, and arms sales to Taiwan continue.
</P>
<P>
   Dec. 31, 1979 _ Treaty canceled. As part of ``normalization''
with the mainland, Carter abrogates America's 1954 mutual defense
treaty with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Aug. 17, 1982 - Arms Sales. President Ronald Reagan pledges
gradual reduction in sales of U.S. weapons to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   1991 - Olive Branch. Taiwan renounces force to retake the
mainland, and informal talks begin with China.
</P>
<P>
   June 1995 - New Friction. Taiwan president Lee Teng-hui makes
``private'' trip to the United States for a Cornell University
reunion. China blasts this as a plot to promote Taiwan independence
and accuses Clinton administration of reneging on 1978 decision to
break Taiwan ties.
</P>
<P>
   July-October 1995 - Missile Test. China ratchets up pressure by
firing unarmed nuclear-capable missiles, then staging a live-fire
naval exercise off the Chinese coast.
</P>
<P>
   March 1996 - U.S. Carriers. China holds televised live-fire war
games in Taiwan Strait. Clinton responds by dispatching two
nuclear-armed carrier battle groups to waters near Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   1997-98 - De-escalation. Taiwan and China mend fences through
family visits, business deals and informal negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Early June 1998 - Congress Demands. By 411-0, U.S. House of
Representatives adopts resolution demanding that China abandon its
threat to invade Taiwan if the island declares its independence.
China refuses.
</P>
<P>
   June 18, 1998 - Taiwan Suspends. Taiwan suspends summer war
games to avoid being ``troublemaker'' during Clinton visit to
China.

E. COLI CONTAMINATION UNLIKELY IN POOLS, EXPERTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The water is fine. That's the message from health
and pool experts who say you're more likely to get E. coli from
contaminated food than from a chlorinated swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about contaminated pool water surfaced after a severe
outbreak of E. coli bacteria sickened at least 10 children at a
Georgia waterpark earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials believe an ill child caused the problem by
defecating in the pool. Other children swallowed the contaminated
water before chlorine and a filter system could treat the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The incident is believed to be the first of its type at a
children's pool.
</P>
<P>
   But that one outbreak shouldn't keep people from taking a dip to
cool off during this unusually hot and humid spell. Health and pool
experts emphasized that such problems are preventable if swimmers
and pool operators follow proper sanitary precautions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly what happened in Georgia points to the possibility,
but we haven't had these occurrences here,'' said Kristine Smith, a
spokeswoman at the New York State Health Department. ``By far, the
most common transmission route of getting E. coli is eating
undercooked ground meat.''
</P>
<P>
   E. coli is a common bacteria found in the intestines of humans
and other mammals. It can be spread through exposure to
contaminated food or from one person to another through fecal
matter, if proper handwashing habits aren't followed.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms include severe diarrhea and abdominal cramps. In some
people, particularly children under five and the elderly, E. coli
can cause kidney failure and even death.
</P>
<P>
   To date, it's been most often associated with a number of
food-borne illnesses, including a 1994 outbreak in the Pacific
Northwest that killed four and sickened hundreds. It's been found
in hamburger meat, raw milk, unpasteurized apple juice and alfalfa
sprouts.
</P>
<P>
   But up until the Georgia incident, E. coli hasn't been
associated with swimming pools.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials often are more concerned about E. coli
contamination in lakes and ponds because of pollution from boats
and sewage systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have this happen in a pool is extremely unusual,'' Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite precautions, health and pool experts say accidents will
happen, especially with young children.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the best advice is to let the pool manager know
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The protocol is to close the pool, get everybody out and
disinfect until the problem is resolved,'' Smith said.

<P>
   Two and a half years ago China and the United States stumbled
into a military confrontation that neither had sought or
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in retrospect, the March 1996 face-off between U.S.
aircraft carriers and Chinese warships and land-based missiles may
have had a salutary effect. The crisis reminded both countries of
the stake each has in positive relations with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the two governments have worked hard to establish a
respectful dialogue about a range of bilateral and international
issues. Summits and other high-level meetings are once again a
regular feature of Sino-American diplomacy, and there have been no
further military confrontations in the Taiwan area.
</P>
<P>
   Until President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in
June 1995, Taiwan and the Chinese mainland had been moving toward
mutual accommodation through informal economic and cultural
exchanges and dialogue. On both sides of the strait there was a
consensus on the ideal of ``one China'' and the imperative of
realizing it through some form of reunification.
</P>
<P>
   This consensus, endorsed by the United States, kept the peace
and fostered an atmosphere conducive to negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   But again the consensus has collapsed. Taiwan seems convinced it
can campaign for independence with the military backing of the
United States. If war is to be prevented, Washington must convince
Taipei as well as Beijing that it is time for them to work out a
mutually acceptable relationship.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has underscored the U.S. interest in resolving
the Taiwan question by peaceful rather than violent means. Yet most
American observers, including most members of Congress, have drawn
a lesson that the prospect of U.S. military intervention can deter
a Chinese attack on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders have always said they would go to war to prevent
the permanent division of China. They now believe that they are
likely to have to do so. China's armed forces have begun a
decade-long effort to acquire the capabilities to overwhelm
Taiwan's formidable defenses.
</P>
<P>
   If a demonstrated ability to do this proves insufficient to
dissuade Taiwan from separation, China's armed forces expect to
receive an order to invade the island, notwithstanding the risk of
conflict with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) displays
of force that followed Lee's visit to the United States stimulated
fear and dislike of the mainland and accelerated the demise of
popular support for reunification. The sudden arrival of U.S.
aircraft carriers halted any conciliatory moves toward Beijing. It
convinced the leaders of Taiwan's ruling and opposition parties
that they could count on U.S. intervention to shield them.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has attempted to shake this
conviction through quiet dialogue with Taiwan. But its leaders put
much more credence in the unqualified public statements of support
they hear from majorities in both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's leaders make no secret of their belief that, whatever
the cause of a crisis in the Taiwan Strait, U.S. congressional
pressure would quickly overwhelm a reluctant Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   And so Taiwanese politicians have concluded that they have wide
latitude to reject reunification and to maneuver the island toward
independence.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's Kuomintang (KMT) still pays lip service to reunification,
saying that it might be considered when and if the Chinese mainland
democratizes. Hsu Hsin-liang's opposition Democratic Progressive
Party flatly opposes reunification under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, governments on both sides of the Taiwan Strait
embraced the concept of ``one China'' _ although they disagreed, of
course, on which was the legitimate regime.
</P>
<P>
   By 1997, cross-strait trade was worth about $26.5 billion a
year. About 35,000 Taiwanese companies had invested $30 billion in
the PRC. Nearly 1.5 million visits _ the vast majority of them from
Taiwan to the Chinese mainland _ were being made each year. The
steady relaxation of tensions included minor steps to facilitate
the exchange of mail and trade across the strait.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing and Taipei also established a regular channel of
communication between citizens' groups, or ``nongovernmental''
organizations, to handle discussions with the other.
</P>
<P>
   Lee now asserts that the Republic of China, first established in
1912 by Sun Yat-sen, is still a sovereign independent nation whose
territory is limited to Taiwan and its offshore islands, and
entitled to international recognition as such.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's efforts to redefine itself as a sovereign nation-state
distinct from the PRC have been backed by well-financed ``pragmatic
diplomacy'' aimed at changing the global context of the Taiwan
question and raising the island's profile. Taipei has used economic
grants to persuade developing countries to recognize it as a state
separate from the PRC and to support its campaign to gain a seat at
the United Nations and other world groups.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, Taipei cannot join international
organizations unless Beijing agrees. Beijing was willing to
compromise on this issue when Taipei's membership was consistent
with the principle of ``one China.'' Taipei's new insistence on
independence has made additional compromises unacceptable to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a flag and other symbols of nationhood, it is difficult
to see what Taiwan would gain from formal separation from China.
Nor, truth be told, would Beijing gain much from reunification.
Mainland China is already benefiting from Taiwan's economic
know-how and financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Taiwan accept Lee's redefinition of the status quo and
see no reason to return to a view of the status quo as ``one China,
even if not now.'' In short, Taiwan's domestic politics now makes
it difficult for its leaders to address Beijing's reunification
agenda, even if they wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's political establishment does not want to appear to be
against talks across the strait because that would not sit well
with the United States or Japan. The problem is that Taiwanese
public opinion will only permit talks with Beijing about how to
preserve and enhance Taiwan's separation from China. Taiwan's
leaders know that Beijing cannot accept such a premise for talks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the 1950s, there is a real danger that
decisions in Taipei, not just Beijing, could ignite a conflict in
the Taiwan Strait. The United States, as well as both Chinese
parties, would be a loser in any such conflict, whether American
forces joined it or not.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy can no longer hope to deter war exclusively by
keeping Beijing at bay. The United States must also discourage
decisions and actions by Taipei that could leave Beijing with
little choice but to react militarily.
</P>
<P>
   But such a policy cannot be implemented if Congress and the
administration remain at odds. A serious effort to forge a national
consensus on policy toward China, including Taiwan, is overdue. The
United States should state unequivocally that it will not support
or endorse any unilateral change in Taiwan's status by either
Beijing or Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   The rising military tensions in the Taiwan Strait also call for
a reevaluation of arms sales to Taiwan. In the 1982 Sino-American
communique, China pledged ``to strive for a peaceful solution to
the Taiwan question.'' In return the United States promised to cap
the quantity and sophistication of its arms sales to Taiwan,
``leading to a final resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot hold Beijing to its word if Americans
do not keep theirs. The sale of 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan in 1992
and some subsequent deals do not square with the 1982 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is now wavering in its determination to stick with a
policy of peaceful resolution of its differences with Taipei. How
much of this wavering is due to U.S. noncompliance with the 1982
communique and how much to Taipei's new opposition to reunification
is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan no longer work
to boost Taipei's confidence that it can work out its differences
with Beijing. Instead, they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its
own way, regardless of history, geography and the views of Chinese
across the strait. This is not the message the United States should
be sending Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   That is why at a minimum the United States should return to
strict compliance with Ronald Reagan's 1982 understanding with Deng
Xiaoping and insist that Beijing do likewise. And as the United
States considers further arms sales to Taiwan, it should weigh
their impact on Taipei's intentions and behavior as well as
Beijing's.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest strengths of Taiwan's 22 million people are their
superior political and economic systems, not their capacity to
outspend, outarm or outfight the nearly 1.3 billion Chinese across
the strait _ with or without backing from U.S. forces. Taiwan's
security depends, in the end, on its ability to work out a mutually
satisfactory relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is no longer the central actor in cross-strait
relations, but its words and actions continue to shape their
context.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should return to a focus on the most important
interest of the Taiwan question _ ensuring that it is resolved
peacefully, by mutual accommodation, rather than in war.
</P>
<P>
   The regular summit meetings on which China and the United States
have now embarked offers ample opportunity to do so.

1912 by Sun Yat-sen, is still a sovereign independent nation whose
territory is limited to Taiwan and its offshore islands, and
entitled to international recognition as such.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's efforts to redefine itself as a sovereign nation-state
distinct from the PRC have been backed by well-financed ``pragmatic
diplomacy'' aimed at changing the global context of the Taiwan
question and raising the island's profile. Taipei has used economic
grants to persuade developing countries to recognize it as a state
separate from the PRC and to support its campaign to gain a seat at
the United Nations and other world groups.
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, Taipei cannot join international
organizations unless Beijing agrees. Beijing was willing to
compromise on this issue when Taipei's membership was consistent
with the principle of ``one China.'' Taipei's new insistence on
independence has made additional compromises unacceptable to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Besides a flag and other symbols of nationhood, it is difficult
to see what Taiwan would gain from formal separation from China.
Nor, truth be told, would Beijing gain much from reunification.
Mainland China is already benefiting from Taiwan's economic
know-how and financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Taiwan accept Lee's redefinition of the status quo and
see no reason to return to a view of the status quo as ``one China,
even if not now.'' In short, Taiwan's domestic politics now makes
it difficult for its leaders to address Beijing's reunification
agenda, even if they wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's political establishment does not want to appear to be
against talks across the strait because that would not sit well
with the United States or Japan. The problem is that Taiwanese
public opinion will only permit talks with Beijing about how to
preserve and enhance Taiwan's separation from China. Taiwan's
leaders know that Beijing cannot accept such a premise for talks.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the 1950s, there is a real danger that
decisions in Taipei, not just Beijing, could ignite a conflict in
the Taiwan Strait. The United States, as well as both Chinese
parties, would be a loser in any such conflict, whether American
forces joined it or not.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy can no longer hope to deter war exclusively by
keeping Beijing at bay. The United States must also discourage
decisions and actions by Taipei that could leave Beijing with
little choice but to react militarily.
</P>
<P>
   But such a policy cannot be implemented if Congress and the
administration remain at odds. A serious effort to forge a national
consensus on policy toward China, including Taiwan, is overdue. The
United States should state unequivocally that it will not support
or endorse any unilateral change in Taiwan's status by either
Beijing or Taipei.
</P>
<P>
   The rising military tensions in the Taiwan Strait also call for
a reevaluation of arms sales to Taiwan. In the 1982 Sino-American
communique, China pledged ``to strive for a peaceful solution to
the Taiwan question.'' In return the United States promised to cap
the quantity and sophistication of its arms sales to Taiwan,
``leading to a final resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States cannot hold Beijing to its word if Americans
do not keep theirs. The sale of 150 F-16 fighters to Taiwan in 1992
and some subsequent deals do not square with the 1982 agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is now wavering in its determination to stick with a
policy of peaceful resolution of its differences with Taipei. How
much of this wavering is due to U.S. noncompliance with the 1982
communique and how much to Taipei's new opposition to reunification
is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   What is clear is that U.S. arms sales to Taiwan no longer work
to boost Taipei's confidence that it can work out its differences
with Beijing. Instead, they bolster the view that Taiwan can go its
own way, regardless of history, geography and the views of Chinese
across the strait. This is not the message the United States should
be sending Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   That is why at a minimum the United States should return to
strict compliance with Ronald Reagan's 1982 understanding with Deng
Xiaoping and insist that Beijing do likewise. And as the United
States considers further arms sales to Taiwan, it should weigh
their impact on Taipei's intentions and behavior as well as
Beijing's.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest strengths of Taiwan's 22 million people are their
superior political and economic systems, not their capacity to
outspend, outarm or outfight the nearly 1.3 billion Chinese across
the strait _ with or without backing from U.S. forces. Taiwan's
security depends, in the end, on its ability to work out a mutually
satisfactory relationship with China.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is no longer the central actor in cross-strait
relations, but its words and actions continue to shape their
context.
</P>
<P>
   Washington should return to a focus on the most important
interest of the Taiwan question _ ensuring that it is resolved
peacefully, by mutual accommodation, rather than in war.
</P>
<P>
   The regular summit meetings on which China and the United States
have now embarked offers ample opportunity to do so.

MASTER OF MOLECULE MANIPULATION WORKS ON THE WILD SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ An atom can be here, there and somewhere
else all at once; it can be going both this way and that way; it
can be rattling with internal energy and quiet. Such are the quirky
freedoms of the quantum microworld that do not apply to
automobiles, apples or people.
</P>
<P>
   But if there is an exception to this rule, it would be the mind
of Dr. Steven Chu, the master of manipulating atoms and molecules
who shared the most recent Nobel Prize in Physics with two other
researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Chu, a professor at Stanford University, ranges so widely among
topics of interest to him that any attempt to keep up leaves a
blurry succession of visual images, like a slide show inadequately
describing one's dream vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Here he is clutching a reuben sandwich while filling a steno pad
with sketches of an experiment to stretch DNA molecules like
knotted rubber bands. Here, he is in the back of a cab where he is
alternately shouting instructions to the driver and quietly
rationalizing his mega-celebrity status in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   This one shows him explaining the cosmological theory of
multiple universes to the Dalai Lama. And finally, here, in his
lab, Chu is pointing through the window of a vacuum chamber to a
hovering blob of atoms that are trapped and supercooled by the
forces of laser light _ the achievement for which he won the 1997
Nobel Prize.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent day in his Stanford office, the 50-year-old,
aggressively trim Chu, wearing khaki trousers, a pullover shirt and
scruffy tennis shoes, sat on a puffy couch and held court for his
students and research associates. He bounced between taking phone
calls and bantering about projects that combine conceptual
simplicity with a faint air of unbelievability.
</P>
<P>
   In one experiment, the drop of a ``fountain'' of atoms is
clocked to measure gravity so precisely that the technique could be
used like a petroleum dowser to find hidden pockets of oil. In
others, a single DNA molecule marked with fluorescent dyes is
dragged about as a video camera mounted on a microscope captures
the reptilian motions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm drawn towards the wilder, science-fiction-type stuff,''
said Chu, who grew up in Garden City, N.Y. ``It's much more fun for
me to learn completely new things than it is to sort of ice the
cake,'' he said. ``Well, that's part of the reason one is a
scientist. It's not to just crawl into a little corner of some
field and go to all of the meetings that all 50 of you in the world
go to. `Oh, this person twiddled that and look what happened.'
After a while it becomes a little rococo, if you know what I
mean.''
</P>
<P>
   That adventurousness is reflected in Chu's recent moves from his
original field of atomic physics into polymer science, chemistry
and biology. But unlike the average scientific dilettante, Chu sees
to it that this crosscutting work always bears the mark of his
experimental dazzle and intuition for pay dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Steve brings to science is an incredible technical
virtuosity _ a sort of technical showmanship,'' said David
Pritchard, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in Cambridge. ``There is this terrific scientific taste,'' added
Daniel Kleppner, also of MIT. ``He has the vision to see new areas
emerging. He's a damn good experimenter, but he's also highly
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who work most closely with Chu say he also has the
incalculably useful ability to see the complex interactions of the
microworld directly, rather than relying on the equations that
thicken the chapters of physics textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to resort to those formulas,'' said Cheng
Chin, one of Chu's doctoral students. ``He has atoms in his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Chu emerged from a cauldron of academic overachievement.
His father, who emigrated from mainland China to study chemical
engineering at MIT, retired as a professor at Brooklyn Polytechnic
University and is a member of the Academica Sinica, Taiwan's most
distinguished scholarly society.
</P>
<P>
   His mother studied economics at a prestigious university in
China. Two brothers and four cousins eventually generated three
MDs, four PhDs and a law degree. And that doesn't count the aunts
and uncles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was to become the academic black sheep,'' Chu wrote in a
recent biographical sketch for the Nobel Foundation. There is still
an edge to his voice when he recalls that in his father's eyes, he
never lived up to the dizzying scholarly achievements of his older
brother, Gilbert Chu, an associate professor in the Stanford School
of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   With what he described as a ``relatively lackluster'' record at
Garden City High, Chu was not accepted into Ivy League colleges.
Instead, he attended the University of Rochester, where his
intellectual appetite exploded, leading to undergraduate degrees in
physics and math and a doctorate at the University of California at
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   An encounter with the late Richard Feynman's ``Lectures in
Physics,'' a comprehensive and idiosyncratic introduction to basic
physics, ignited an interest in theoretical physics. Not until
later, well into graduate school, did he start fiddling with
equipment in physics laboratories at night. It was like Nat King
Cole finding his voice: So long, jazz piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Well, it's ridiculous, sneaking in and making play
experiments, and I'm ignoring my theoretical problem,' '' Chu
explained. Experiments became the day job.
</P>
<P>
   He immediately began a long-term relationship with the powerful
light source called the laser. His method was to juice up the
inadequate equipment he could buy off the shelf, which let him stay
ahead of the beat scientifically. That improvisational approach
served him well when he moved to the old AT&AMP;T Bell Laboratories,
the famed center of technical and scientific innovation in New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``He would come into my office with great ideas, all excited,
and scripple stuff on my board,'' said Dr. Douglas Osheroff, who
shared the previous Nobel Prize in Physics and is also now a
professor at Stanford. (The university has raked in five physics
Nobels in the past 10 years.)
</P>
<P>
   As to the cross-disciplinary flair Chu would develop, Osheroff
said, ``that was a very standard approach at Bell Laboratories and
almost part of the culture there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was at Bell Labs that Chu met Arthur Ashkin, who was trapping
microscopic particles with laser light and who dreamed of trapping
atoms. Ashkin and his colleagues were the first to demonstrate that
particles would ``stick'' to the laser beam for nearly the same
reasons that dust sticks to a glass rod that has been charged
positively by rubbing it with cat's fur.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a dust mote has no net charge, its negative charges
_ electrons _ crowd over to the side closest to the rod, being
pulled toward it like vacationers waving at the rails of a docking
ship. That leaves a positive excess on the opposite side of the
mote, but because the negative charges are closer to the rod, their
attraction wins out and the mote sticks.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bell Labs apparatus, the dancing electric fields of laser
light take the place of those static electrical charges, attracting
a particle to the most intense parts of a laser beam. Instruments
that move particles around with lasers have come to be called
``laser tweezers.''
</P>
<P>
   After adding this technique to his repertoire, Chu expanded on
it by ``gluing'' tiny polystyrene beads, which he could grab and
move with laser tweezers, onto strands of fluorescent DNA. By
stretching the DNA and dragging it through a soup of other DNA
molecules, he and colleagues at Stanford later helped confirm
theories developed by Pierre-Gilles de Gennes, the Nobel Prize
winner at the Ecole Superieure de Physique et de Chimie
Industrielles in Paris. Dr. de Gennes had predicted that any such
long molecules, called polymers, should ``reptate,'' or change
directions like a snake, whose entire body follows the same path
without cutting corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had theories of that kind of thing for years,'' said
Bruno Zimm, in the chemistry department of the University of
California at San Diego. ``Actually seeing it is something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, reptation helps explain the toy-store
mystery of why Silly Putty bounces and squishes. If a child hurls
it against a wall, the impact comes faster than the polymers in the
putty can move along their tortuous paths, so the putty acts like a
solid and bounces. But a slow squish gives the polymers time to
slither around. Academics call such materials ``viscoelastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Still more recently, using a different method for manipulating
the polymers, Chu and his colleagues, Thomas Perkins and Douglas
Smith, took DNA that was in a naturally coiled state and stretched
it. They found that identical polymers beginning from the same
state can uncoil in different ways, getting hung up in strange
knots and bends _ behavior de Gennes called ``molecular
individualism.''
</P>
<P>
   This effect could be important in everything from the extrusion
of plastics to the flow of oil in pipelines, where squirming,
free-floating polymers reduce the drag when they are added to the
oil _ improving the flow for reasons that are still poorly
understood. And, noting that in every unraveling of the virus DNA
polymers they used ``you have the same virus and the same genes and
very, very different outcomes,'' he suggested lightly, ``So maybe
you can take that as a moral in life _ that it's neither nature nor
nurture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Polymer physicists were goo-goo, ga-ga over it,'' said Chu of
the DNA work.
</P>
<P>
   But the loudest applause came when Chu used laser light to chill
atoms, so that they _ like the beads _ could be trapped. At room
temperature this would be a hopeless task, because atoms are moving
at thousands of miles per hour and cannot be captured.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, Chu and his colleagues at Bell Labs cooled a cloud of
atoms to 240 millionths of a degree above absolute zero with what
he called ``optical molasses.'' They did it by bathing the atoms in
laser beams fired together from all directions, which created a
kind of drag that slowed the atoms to inches per second,
corresponding to the low temperature. That achievement finally
allowed atoms to be laser-trapped by several methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard about it, I said, `That's incredible,' ''
recalled Kleppner of MIT. ``And the next thing was, `But of course;
why not do that?' '' The molasses analogy was a brilliant way of
seeing through the immense technical challenges posed by the
optical cooler, Kleppner said.
</P>
<P>
   Chu shared the Nobel Prize with William Phillips of the National
Institute of Standards and Technology and Claude Cohen-Tannoudji of
the Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris. All three have made enormous
contributions to the science of atom cooling and trapping.
</P>
<P>
   The traps have become standard equipment for creating the
ultraprecise timepieces called atomic clocks. The techniques are
also often a starting point for outlandish physics experiments,
such as when scientists at the University of Colorado, Boulder,
created a new state of ultracold matter called a Bose-Einstein
condensate two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Like a juggler whose hands become ever more difficult to follow
over the years, Chu has continued playing tricks with trapped
atoms. In one experiment, for example, he and Mark Kasevich of Yale
University used laser pulses to put atoms into ``split
personality'' states predicted by quantum theory. Both states feel
the tug of gravity as they move on slightly different trajectories.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The degree to which those states are compatible when the split
atoms recombine gives a measure of gravity's strength to about a
part in a billion. That is fine enough to detect underground
geological features, like oil pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Chu has also continued the push into biology, partly in
collaboration with Jim Spudich, chairman of the biochemistry
department at Stanford. This aspect of Chu's work has become so
well known that he was almost lured away by another university's
fetching offer to co-direct a new cross-disciplinary institute. ``I
was tempted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He turned down the offer because of the difficult decisions the
move would have entailed for his two sons, ages 13 and 16. Chu is
divorced and shares in their care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fundamentally, I'm happy here,'' he said in his office. ``I'm
very much against people trying to leverage themselves and their
institutions. I don't want to see academics go into a state of free
agency.''
</P>
<P>
   As high as his star has risen in the United States, it is
nothing compared to his profile in Taiwan. His friend Yuan Lee _
yet another Nobel Prize-winning physicist _ now heads the Academica
Sinica, of which Chu is a member. The combination of Chu's ties to
Taiwan, his particular brand of charisma and a society that still
lionizes scholars has led to hordes of cameras and reporters'
shadowing him in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time he came back and said: `Taiwan is crazy for me,' ''
Chin recalled. A Taiwanese professor joked that Chu's popularity
was second only to Leonardo diCaprio's for a time. ``DiCaprio is
first by a whole lot,'' insisted Chu, who said that he speaks only
basic Chinese with a heavy American accent.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Dalai Lama found an opportunity to talk physics with
him a few years ago. ``He was obsessed with finding out what
physics could say about time,'' Chu said. ``I'm surmising why,'' he
explained. ``If you're a Buddhist, you believe in reincarnation,
and there's this conservation-of-souls problem,'' referring to the
question of where new souls come from as the number of living
beings in the world keeps expanding.
</P>
<P>
   In his moments with the Dalai Lama, the exiled leader of Tibet,
who wore his saffron robes for the public conversation, Chu
outlined the speculative theory that the universe is just one of
many that are appearing and disappearing like bubbles in a
champagne glass. (The theory is notably championed by another
Stanford physicist, Andrei Linde.) That way, as vast amounts of
time passed and whole universes became inhospitable to life, souls
might flit from one universe to another and keep the total number
constant, Chu suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``He just listened,'' said Chu. ``Juuuuust listened.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On broad plains layered with silt from the Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers, the people of ancient Mesopotamia managed to build the
first cities and spreading empires without local sources of such
raw materials of civilization as timber, metal ores, and stone.
What they could not import, they had to do without, or, as
archeologists have now discovered, learn how to make synthetic
substitutes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, archeologists and geologists reported finding the
first evidence of artificial stone in the ruins of Mashkan-shapir,
a city that existed about 4,000 years ago in what is now southern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Artisans had apparently heated fine-grained alluvial silt to
melting temperatures, then slowly cooled it to produce rock-hard
slab resembling a type of volcanic rock called basalt.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elizabeth C. Stone, an archeologist at the State University
of New York, at Stony Brook, described the discovery in the current
issue of the journal Science and in interviews. The findings were
based on a recent geological analysis of 17 pieces of stone
collected before the Persian Gulf war in 1991, and more soil and
stone samples borrowed from a museum in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stone's excavations in the late 1980s established
Mashkan-shapir as a relatively large city of 15,000 people in the
early second millennium B.C., after the collapse of the city of Ur
as the center of power. After a brief period of glory,
Mashkan-shapir declined and was abandoned in 1720 B.C. Its ruins
disappeared in the desert until archeologists began digging there
in this century.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the synthetic rock slabs, which measure about 30 inches
long, 16 inches wide, and 3 inches thick, were found in ruins near
one of the city's temples.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think they looked right,'' Dr. Stone said in an
interview. ``I thought, ah, this is just bad basalt.''
</P>
<P>
   One of her colleagues, Dr. Donald H. Lindsley, a Stony Brook
geologist, tested the slabs and linked them to local soils and to
several hundred fragments of rock found across the site. He and
other researchers satisfied themselves that the slabs were not
merely slag from metal or pottery furnaces.
</P>
<P>
   The synthetic basalt, Dr. Stone and her colleagues reported,
``appears to have been manufactured in some quantity as a
substitute for the natural basalt that had been used for grinding
grain in all parts of the ancient Near East since the beginning of
agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the coincidence of a scholar named Stone from a
university in Stony Brook finding the earliest known fake stone,
the discovery is noteworthy because it should provide new insights
into the history of ancient technology, especially the innovative
uses of fire in transforming raw materials into pottery, metal,
plaster, and glass.
</P>
<P>
   Such early production of synthetic stone was previously unknown
to historians, but its discovery suggests the existence of a
creative collaboration between metallurgists and ceramicists in
Mesopotamia about 4,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stone and her associates said that the deliberate production
of synthetic rock suggested that Mesopotamian artisans had learned
the technology from their experience in smelting metals and baking
pottery. The intense heats applied in those processes produced a
byproduct of slag that bore similarities to volcanic rock.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence, the archeologists said in their conclusion,
``suggests that the potentialities of those byproducts as a
substitute for imported grinding stones was perceived and that the
pyrotechnologies developed by potters and smiths were pooled in an
experimental process that eventually yielded a consistent
product.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Dr. Vincent C. Pigott, a specialist in ancient
technologies at the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archeology
and Anthropology, who participated in the artificial-stone study,
said he doubted that this was a true example of need being the
mother of invention, even though Mesopotamians clearly needed
scarce stone for building and grinding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know the pathways by which these people came
to artificial basalt,'' Pigott said. ``But most innovations in
technology proceed from experimentation and esthetics, not need.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Iraq is again open to archeological work, Dr. Stone said,
many questions about the artificial basalt will remain unanswered.
She would like to return to Mashkan-shapir to search for the
furnaces that were used for making the stone. They were at least
three feet in diameter, judging by the size of the largest slabs.
</P>
<P>
   Finding the furnaces could reveal much about the actual process
of making artificial stone some 4,000 years ago.

DINING A LA SPOCK IN A FAST-FOOD ERA 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Picture a childhood without ice cream or the occasional hot dog
or burger at a birthday party or ball game. Picture in their stead
organic applesauce, peanut butter and soy patties.
</P>
<P>
   The latter are the kinds of foods children should be fed if they
are to grow up lean and healthy, states the most influential book
on bringing up children, Dr. Benjamin Spock's ``Baby and Child
Care'' (Pocket Books).
</P>
<P>
   In a radical shift from the nutritional advice offered in
previous editions, the new seventh edition of this bible of
child-rearing advises parents to provide an all-plant, or vegan,
diet for their children after the age of 2.
</P>
<P>
   Spock, who died in March at 94, just weeks before the new
edition was published, had himself become a strict vegetarian in
1991, a change that his wife said greatly improved his failing
health and enabled him to complete the revision of his world-famous
book, which has guided parents through the sturm and drang of
child-raising for more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   But what an ailing man near the end of his life is willing to
eat (especially when a devoted wife is willing to spend hours a day
preparing his meals) is not necessarily what American children and
their already overworked parents could or would readily adopt.
</P>
<P>
   The dietary change recommended in the book would mean getting
all protein from plant foods like beans, nuts, tofu and other soy
products and seitan, a protein concentrate made from wheat.
</P>
<P>
   It would mean relying on vegetables, fortified plant foods and
drinks and a daily vitamin-mineral supplement to provide needed
amounts of essential nutrients like calcium, iron, zinc and
vitamins D and B-12 that are most readily available from animal
foods like meat, poultry, fish and milk.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that this way of eating is unhealthy _ quite the
opposite. Avoiding the saturated fats and cholesterol in animal
foods and consuming lots of fiber and nutrients from vegetables and
fruits could go a long way toward reducing problems with heart
disease, obesity, high blood pressure, gallbladder disease and even
some cancers later in life.
</P>
<P>
   But parents who decide to adopt Spock's nutritional advice
should know that it requires careful meal planning and professional
guidance to insure that the children will not be shortchanged on
needed nutrients.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should also realize that it will not always be easy to
prepare vegan meals for all occasions or to get children to eat
them. Children do not like to be different from their friends. Even
the most self-possessed youngsters may balk when friends comment
negatively about what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   Placing children on a vegan diet is a recommendation that few
experts in childhood nutrition endorse. Concerns center on the
ability of small children to consume enough bulky plant foods to
take in all the calories and nutrients they need to sustain normal
growth. Particularly worrisome are the calcium and iron that are
best absorbed from milk and meats, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most experts, including nutrition advisers to the
American Academy of Pediatrics, recommend a less radical approach
to children's diets _ a reduced dependence on animal foods,
especially those high in fat and cholesterol, and more emphasis on
plant foods that are excellent sources of the fiber, nutrients and
phytochemicals that many studies have linked to protection against
a wide range of devastating diseases.
</P>
<P>
   In its current Pediatric Nutrition Handbook, the academy points
out that small children can do very well on a diet that is partly
vegetarian (for example, includes no red meat or poultry but does
include fish, dairy products and eggs) and on a
lacto-ovo-vegetarian diet (dairy foods, eggs and plants) or
lacto-vegetarian diet (with dairy products as the only animal
foods).
</P>
<P>
   But for pure vegetarians, or vegans, the academy says parents
must pay close attention to what their children eat to be sure that
a wide variety of food is consumed and that meals are nutritionally
balanced. It urges particular care in making sure vegan children
get enough of certain nutrients that other children get from animal
foods. Among those nutrients are these:
</P>
<P>
   VITAMIN B-12, available through fortified soy milk or cereals or
a vitamin supplement.
</P>
<P>
   VITAMIN D, available by being in the sun _ without sunscreen _
for about 15 minutes each day. But sun as a source of this
essential vitamin is highly problematic in winter in the more
northerly parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   CALCIUM, which is not as well absorbed from plant foods as from
milk and other dairy products. Plant sources of calcium listed by
Spock include calcium-fortified soy milk, orange juice and tofu,
cooked dried beans and green leafy vegetables like broccoli, kale,
collards, watercress, Swiss chard, Chinese cabbage and bok choy.
</P>
<P>
   PROTEIN, by making sure that complementary plant sources like
beans and grains are consumed daily. Individual plant sources of
protein do not supply all the essential amino acids the body needs
to make new proteins. But complementary sources of plant proteins
like rice and beans do not have to be consumed in the same meal,
just on the same day, experts now know.
</P>
<P>
   A vegetarian diet for children has to be a family affair. You
cannot expect your children to eat tofu while you dine on
hamburgers. If you decide to feed your children a diet that
restricts some, most or all animal foods, you have to be prepared
to eat that way, too.
</P>
<P>
   Children who grow up eating rice and beans for breakfast and
whose parents eat that as well will not think it strange, at least
until they are old enough for sleepovers. But if you expect
children to stick to a vegan diet even when they eat away from
home, you may have to pack take-along plant foods.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Bonci, a registered dietitian in private practice in
Pittsburgh, is a vegan who is raising her two sons, ages 9 and 14,
on a vegetarian diet that includes some dairy products and eggs.
For school lunch, she says, vegetarian youngsters may be able to
get salad and fruit in school and bring the rest of their lunch
from home. When eating out with friends at a fast-food restaurant,
they might fill up on potatoes and salad and make up for the
missing nutrients at other meals.
</P>
<P>
   There are emotional and social concerns as well. Dr. T. Berry
Brazelton, the prominent child behavior specialist at Boston City
Hospital, noted that ``most children in their second and third year
are in such rebellion about food, it's hard to get them to eat any
vegetables.'' This can put pressure on parents, he said, ``who in
turn will put pressure on their kids.''
</P>
<P>
   There may also be difficulties when children are in social
situations, like birthday parties, where they may have to avoid
most of the foods served and perhaps be teased about it. Brazelton
said, ``There's already enough pressure on kids not to add that
one.'' &QL;

POLL SHOWS D'AMATO FACING LESS-THAN-EASY CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARVY LIPMAN  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Two of the three times Alfonse D'Amato has won
elections for the U.S. Senate, he has eked by with less than 50
percent of the vote. If the latest poll numbers hold up, he's
headed for a similar squeaker in November.
</P>
<P>
   Despite aggressive early advertising and weeks of campaign-style
public appearances, D'Amato holds only a slight edge over his
closest Democratic challenger, former congresswoman and vice
presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, according to a new Albany
Times Union-Syracuse Newspapers poll conducted by Zogby
International in Utica, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The poll of 707 registered voters also showed that after three
terms in office, more voters had a negative view of D'Amato than a
positive view.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Al D'Amato was `Candidate A' and I looked at his numbers, I
would say he's dead in the water,'' said pollster John Zogby.
``He's an incumbent under 50 percent and he's leading by less than
10 percent. Under normal circumstances, that's a sure defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Zogby said, ``this is D'Amato.''
</P>
<P>
   Zogby was referring to the senator's history of overtaking
opponents who lead him early in the race, despite low approval
ratings in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago he had a 26 percent positive job performance
rating. Now it's in the 40s. All his indicators are up.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Zogby noted, D'Amato also has already raised about $17
million for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro led her two competitors for the nomination in the
September primary, with nearly 40 percent of those Democrats who
said they were likely to vote favoring Ferraro. That's
two-and-a-half times the number who support Rep. Charles Schumer of
Brooklyn, and four times more than support New York City Public
Advocate Mark Green, who lost to D'Amato in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But Zogby said those poll numbers could be misleading, because
the poll also shows most voters don't yet know who Ferraro's
opponents are.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like Ferraro's support is thin,'' he said. ``It's
name-recognition support.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that either Schumer or Green has made up much ground in the
past couple of months. Schumer has gone from 12 percent to 16
percent since April _ while spending a couple of million dollars on
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schumer's problem is that he just doesn't seem to connect with
the voters,'' Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro was leading by tremendous margins in upstate New York
and the New York City suburbs, where Schumer and Green aren't
well-known. Nearly three of four upstate voters said they were not
familiar enough with Schumer and Green to voice an opinion about
them. More than half those in the New York City suburbs said the
same thing.
</P>
<P>
   That unfamiliarity is reflected in which candidate people
support. Nearly half the upstate Democrats said they supported
Ferraro, while Schumer and Green pulled in a combined seven
percent. In the New York City suburbs, Ferraro carried about 40
percent to Schumer's 10 percent and Green's 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Her big lead disappears in New York City, however, where voters
recognize her challengers' names. Only about 25 percent of New York
City residents said they were unfamiliar with Green, and about 33
percent did not know Schumer. Ferraro took 30 percent of the city
vote, to Schumer's 27 percent and Green's 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If she's looking for a big edge among women voters, however,
Ferraro may be in for a surprise. Her lead is noticeably bigger
among men _ 3-to-1 over Schumer and nearly 4-to-1 over Green _ than
it is among female voters. Among women, her lead over Schumer drops
to 2-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever emerges from the Democratic primary will face an
incumbent whose numbers, while not overwhelmingly positive, are
heading up. In a Zogby poll last month, more than half of those
polled gave D'Amato a negative job performance rating. In the
latest poll, the negative number was down to 48 percent _ still
high for a candidate seeking re-election, but lower than figures
D'Amato has registered at this point in previous races.
</P>
<P>
   His positive rating, meanwhile, rose from 38 percent in May to
44 percent in the latest poll.
</P>
<P>
   But that figure relates to his job performance. D'Amato enjoys
higher numbers when voters are asked whether they view him
favorably or unfavorably. By a 2-to-1 margin, those polled said
they have a favorable opinion of the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``This poll shows that working middle-class families of New York
know they've never had a stronger and more effective fighter than
Al D'Amato,'' D'Amato spokesman Harvey Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was conducted June 14-15. It has a margin of error of
plus or minus 3.8 percentage points.

   ASIA-RUBIN (Bangkok, Thailand) _ After a whirlwind visit to
Malaysia, in which he defended the International Monetary Fund's
harsh prescriptions for healing Asia's economies, Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin arrived on Monday evening in the place where
the financial contagion first began. Rubin will meet on Tuesday
with Thailand's prime minister, Chuan Leekpai, and other officials
to discuss their efforts to climb out of a recession _ nearly one
year to the day since Bangkok floated its currency, prompting a
devastating devaluation from which it has yet to recover. Rubin's
tour of Asia comes as the IMF is under growing attack from
politicians and businessmen here, who say the fund's formula of
high interest rates, rigorous fiscal policy, and stable currencies
is strangling the region's economies and worsening the pain of the
crisis. By Mark Landler.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TV-COVERAGE (Undated) _ When a Beijing University student
asked whether Americans have a distorted view of China, President
Clinton answered by pointing to a gallery crammed with lights and
cameras. ``As you can see, a few people come with me from the news
media,'' he said. ``I hoped that my trip would help show a full and
balanced picture of modern China.'' He almost got his wish. Though
intensely focused on human rights, television has depicted a
country so complex and changeable that reporters can hardly keep
up. One minute they are wondering why dissidents were arrested
during Clinton's trip (deliberate insult or public relations
gaffe?). The next, they are wondering why President Jiang Zemin
allowed his joint news conference with Clinton to be televised live
(sign of freedom or public relations coup?) By Caryn James.

<P>
   KOSOVO (Belacevac, Yugoslavia) _ Thousands of Serb special
police units and troops, backed by artillery, heavy armor, and
tanks, launched a series of attacks against separatist rebel
positions on Monday morning. Heavy armored personnel carriers
unleashed volleys at trenches and checkpoints held by lightly armed
Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas in the mining town of Belacevac,
six miles west of Pristina, the provincial capital. Serb gunners
also attacked Lapushnik, where rebels have barricaded the main road
leading from Pristina to Pec. Trucks and jeeps, packed with
soldiers in green camouflage uniforms that lacked unit insignias,
sped to the two battle fronts. There was no word on casualties. By

</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-POLITICS (Jerusalem) _ Issuing the strongest signal yet
of his frustration with the government's peace policies, President
Ezer Weizman on Monday publicly urged Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to call early elections. Weizman's largely ceremonial
office does not give him the power to dissolve the government or
call elections, and Netanyahu immediately responded that he had no
intention of so doing until his four-year term concludes in 2000.
But the unusual statement placed the popular and outspoken
president squarely in opposition to the prime minister, and gave
new credibility and strength to the notion that if Netanyahu is
unable to progress on the long-stalled peace with his two-year-old
coalition, he should take it to the voters. By Serge Schmemann.

   CHILD-SOLDIERS-U.N. (United Nations) _ As a measure of how
dramatically the face of modern warfare has changed in the last
decade, the Security Council spent its day on Monday debating the
rapid increase in the number of child soldiers worldwide and what,
if anything, can be done to keep children out of war. Experts say
that from 250,000 to 300,000 children in at least 50 countries are
directly involved in conflict around the world _ as soldiers,
porters and frequently as all-purpose camp slaves _ in violation of
international treaties. Children are conscripted, cajoled, or
tricked into volunteering and sometimes sold to armies and
guerrilla groups by families thrown into poverty by ethnic
conflicts that now kill more civilians than troops. By Barbara

and, to an unusual degree, achieved it in the term that ended on

justices spoke forcefully in drawing a coherent rule on sexual
harassment from a jumble of confusing precedents and vague
congressional language. They established a framework for applying
the new federal disability law's protections to people with
asymptomatic HIV infection and other conditions that may not at
first glance appear to qualify as disabling. They quickly put to
rest Congress' experiment with the line item veto as well as the
independent counsel's effort to pierce the shield of the
attorney-client privilege. These decisions, and nearly all the
others of the term's 91 rulings, were supported by clear
majorities, free of the ambiguities that often plague the court's

</HEADLINE>
 MARVIN GIROUARD, NEW PIER 1 CEO,(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Marvin Girouard is probably not your
father's idea of a chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's newest CEO, who took over last week at Pier 1
Imports, likes to talk about his rock 'n' roll days as a teen and
the time he hitchhiked to New Orleans with Janis Joplin.
</P>
<P>
   He traces his sense of style to a maverick grandfather who ran
gambling and prostitution houses during the Texas oil boom. He is
so tickled by celebrities that he decorates his office wall with
autographed photos of Meg Ryan and Katie Couric.
</P>
<P>
   But Girouard (pronounced Gerard) has substance as well as
sizzle. He was senior class president at Texas A&AMP;M, a member of the
cadet corps and later a Navy commando in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In the business world, he has been a globe-hopping merchant who
knew which village in Malaysia could produce 10,000 inlaid boxes in
time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been a loyal corporate employee, shunning offers to
lead other retailers and keeping his composure when an outsider was
once picked to run the company instead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is not widely known outside his industry, for 23
years Girouard has worked in key roles for Pier 1, the Fort
Worth-based retailer that does more than a billion dollars in
annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Girouard initially oversaw the worldwide buying that came to
define the home furnishings retailer. For t`e!past decade, he has
been the No. 2 executive who kept operations on track.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, less than two months shy of his 59th birthday,
Girouard finally grabbed the brass ring: He was named chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pier 1 had everything I wanted,'' Girouard said, explaining
why he hung in so long. ``It's like falling in love with a woman or
a beautiful car. Once you find the one you want, you'll wait
forever to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Girouard's climb up the corporate ladder is a tribute to
patience, persistence and loyalty, traits that may seem at odds
with a country-singing Aggie who collects German sports cars and
Rolex watches.
</P>
<P>
   But Girouard often seems to be an odd mix of flash and
conservatism. He made his mark by traveling the world, but once
refused to take a job _ even though he had children and was
unemployed _ because it would force him to move from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He owns three Porsches, wears Italian suits and buys custom-made
shirts in Hong Kong. But his favorite reading includes the National
Enquirer and the Star tabloids, and a top hobby is collecting
baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   Girouard is not physically imposing and admits that he was never
a great athlete. But he led a Navy commando unit in Vietnam,
parachuting onto beaches and swimming up rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In his early days at Pier 1, he was known as ``The Night
Fighter.'' During an uptempo moment at one meeting, an executive
challenged everyone to a push-up contest. Girouard blew away the
competition when he sprang to the floor and started doing them
one-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a quiet man,'' said Bob Bolen, the former Fort
Worth mayor and Hallmark store owner who frequently swaps retailing
tales with Girouard. ``His nature is to make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Girouard applied to Pier 1 in 1975, he had to fill out a
standard job form, and one line asked how he would get to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my Porsche!'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, he was overseeing the company's worldwide
buying, which had him scouring the globe for the trinkets,
housewares and rattan furniture that became Pier 1's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   As Pier 1 began to improve in the early '80s, his role became
increasingly important. With the company adding stores and
upgrading its product line, Girouard not only had to find
interesting, low-cost items, he also had to build the Asian supply
connections that could keep the inventories full.
</P>
<P>
   When Pier 1 picked a new top executive in 1980, Girouard had
hoped to be the choice. He wasn't. Five years later, when the chief
executive left, Girouard made a pitch directly to the board. Again
he was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Girouard said he felt like the builder and owner of
Pier 1, he conceded, ``Now I know that I didn't have the vision or
the experience that this job demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. For the past decade, Girouard has been Pier 1's
strong second-in-command, earning more than $1.2 million last year
and serving as a complement to top executive Clark Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who led Pier 1 for 13 years, stepped aside last week
and became nonexecutive chairman. The two were not close friends
away from the office, but they made a strong team, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was Mr. Outside, a smooth, formal executive who refined
Pier 1's public persona and sharpened the strategy that made it one
of the country's leading speciality retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Girouard was Mr. Inside, a scrappy operations man who can find
almost any item almost anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Among Pier 1 colleagues, Girouard's foreign expertise earned the
nicknames, ``Marco Polo'' and ``Tai-Pan,'' and he was one of the
early American merchants to visit China.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Camp, who led Pier 1 before Johnson and said his
management team was responsible for the company's turnaround,
recalled a visit to a Philippines village after Pier 1 stopped
buying a rattan trunk. The village depended heavily on Pier 1
orders, and people lined the dirt road as Camp and Girouard drove
up, hoping that they could persuade Girouard to order a replacement
piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like MacArthur's second coming,'' Camp said. ``They had
made about 800 different items, and they lined them up,
side-by-side on the grass.''
</P>
<P>
   Girouard sloughs off such memories now, saying that he and the
company have come a long way. In fact, he concedes that he still
holds a grudge against Camp, even though Camp urged him to join
Pier 1 initially.
</P>
<P>
   The rift came in 1985, when Camp unexpectedly left the company
and recommended that another colleague, not Girouard, replace him.
Girouard was so incensed that he went to the board meeting and
asked to be considered for the post.
</P>
<P>
   The directors tapped Johnson, who had been a board member for
two years but had never worked at Pier 1. Then Johnson extended an
olive branch to Girouard, offering him a promotion to senior vice
president and asking him to remain with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Girouard's condition: Johnson had to keep him aboard, not just
use him to train a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson agreed, and Girouard said he thought to himself, ``Maybe
I can learn a lot from this guy. If I wait it out, one day I'll get
my chance.''
</P>
<P>
   That chance was almost delayed again this year. Four months ago,
Girouard said, Johnson suggested that he might want to remain as
CEO until 2000. According to Girouard, the succession plan had
already been approved by the board, and the CEO-in-waiting
threatened to challenge any delay.
</P>
<P>
   After considering the issue for a few days, Johnson agreed to
leave as scheduled, Girouard said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, Johnson congratulated his successor at the annual
shareholders meeting and joked about his persistence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to give Marvin a hand,'' Johnson said. ``Marvin's
gestation period as president was about the longest on record.''
</P>
<P>
   Girouard attributes his determination and flamboyance to his
background and his family, especially his mother and maternal
grandfather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daddy Ben,'' as he was known, was from Spain, and Girouard
said he was one of Port Arthur's most colorful characters during
the early 1900s oil boom. He said his grandfather ran gambling
houses and prostitution rings, drove fancy cars and wore fine
clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real bon vivant man,'' Girouard said, ``and he had a
big influence on my taste and style.''
</P>
<P>
   When Girouard was in junior high, Elvis Presley played in Port
Arthur, and he and his friends were hooked by the beat. Janis
Joplin, a classmate, and several friends and cousins began playing
music and dreaming about the entertainment business.
</P>
<P>
   But Girouard's mother insisted that he become the first person
in the family to attend college. His father, an electrician, urged
him to become an electrical engineer, which could land him one of
the best jobs at the Port Arthur refineries.
</P>
<P>
   Girouard listened to his parents and went to Texas A&AMP;M
University. But it tore at him when a good friend, Johnny Preston,
wrote a hit song, ``Running Bear,'' and other friends made it to TV
dance shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went from playing rock 'n' roll to being a freshman fish in
the corps _ shaving my head and marching on weekends,'' he said.
``God knows I wanted to leave A&AMP;M.''
</P>
<P>
   He stuck it out, blossoming when he switched from engineering to
marketing. He became a class president, an ardent Aggie and a firm
believer in fate. How else, he said, to explain the coincidences
that led to his big breaks?
</P>
<P>
   He insists, for example, that he landed his first job as an
advertising manager because he and the boss shared three things:
They were Navy men, they each wore a Rolex, and each owned a
Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I drove a Buick, who knows how different my life would have
been?'' Girouard said.

YOUNG BRITISH STAR FACES MAJOR TEST AGAINST DEFENSE-MINDED
ARGENTINA

   PARIS _ There is the same pace, the same explosive acceleration,
the same readiness to take on defenders and leave them groping at
shadows, the same killer instinct in front of goal. No wonder,
then, that Michael Owen of England is already being compared to the
star Brazilian striker, Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
   The comparisons are premature, of course. Owen is a novice at
top international level. His coach, Glenn Hoddle, still calls him
``the young lad.'' But at the ripe age of 18, the Liverpool lad has
emerged during the World Cup here as perhaps the most exciting new
talent in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Skill such as Owen's _ the ability to go straight at a defender
and beat him _ has never been at such a premium as in the modern
game. Defenses are so tight, pressing in midfield so intense, that
the only way to find space is often to get past someone. America
had no player here who could that. But Owen _ head down, ball
seeming tied to his foot _ injects a tempo that can disarm the best
defender.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ronaldo at the last World Cup in the United States, Owen
started here as a substitute. But unlike Ronaldo, who was 17 then
and did not not play in America, Owen has already claimed a place
in the starting lineup for England's clash with Argentina on
Tuesday, a match that will test any player's temperament.
</P>
<P>
   He did so in just 17 minutes on the pitch against Romania a week
ago. Coming on as a substitute, Owen took six minutes to score,
sweeping in a cross from fellow-striker Alan Shearer. The goal was
taken with such cat-like speed that the Romanian defenders were
left gaping. A few minutes later, he hit the post with a rasping
right-footed drive from the edge of the penalty box. England still
lost 2-1 to Romania, but even Hoddle could no longer deny that
Owen's time had come.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the England coach had been insisting that Owen, for
all his talent, was too young. ``He still faces the hurdle of
proving he can take on the best defenses in the world,'' Hoddle
liked to say. He has stopped saying that. ``Frankly,'' said England
captain Alan Shearer, ``Owen brings a pace that nobody else, myself
included, can bring.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen, who still lives at home with his parents and four brothers
and sisters in a modest family home near the northwestern English
town of Chester, has already made a habit of breaking records.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, aged 18 years and 59 days, he became the youngest
player to appear for England, making his debut against Chile. Three
months later, aged 18 and 164 days, he became the youngest player
to score for England, beating Tommy Lawton's 60-year-old record
with a goal against Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   In the World Cup, he is now the third-youngest play ever to
participate, behind Norman Whiteside of Northern Ireland and a
young talent from Brazil named Pele, who was 17 when he played in
the 1958 World Cup in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Owen is not the talkative kind, preferring, in the phrase of
former Scottish striker Kenny Dalglish, ``to let my boots do the
talking.'' Here in France, Hoddle has generally kept his young
protege under tight wraps. But Owen is already known for an unusual
level-headedness and a single-minded dedication to achieving his
ambition: becoming the best player in the world. From the age of
15, he has talked with a deadpan assurance of how we will one day
be the world's best. Extraordinarily assured for his age, he seems,
for now, to be on course toward his objective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't look at players' strengths,'' he observed during his
one appearance before the press here. ``You look at their
weaknesses and try to see where you can hurt them most if you get
the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Owen had already done a lot of hurting. Having scored a record
97 goals for Deeside Schools at the age of 10, he was signed up by
Liverpool the following year. Playing in the Liverpool youth team
at the age of 15, he had already established a reputation that
sometimes lured first-team players to go out and watch him. There
was a buzz at Liverpool, that of a special talent that was
emerging. At the age of 17, he became a professional and made his
debut for the club last year, scoring within ten minutes of coming
onto the field as a substitute. He finished last season as joint
top scorer in the English league, an extraordinary achievement for
a player in his first year at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Owen, naturally, has weaknesses. His skills at shielding he
ball, essential for a striker, and his passing are average. But
like Gerd Muller, the legendary German striker who could be
invisible for long periods before bursting into a match with a
goal, Owen has an extraordinary eye for the target. It is this
clinical determination in front of goal, allied to his pace, that
makes Owen so exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   Against Argentina, Owen will face his greatest test. Hoddle, who
was in the England team that lost 2-1 to Argentina in the World Cup
quarterfinal in 1986, a match when Maradona scored a goal with his
hand, has talked of the opportunity to get a grievance ``out of our
systems.'' Owen was all of six back then, but if England is to
break an Argentina defense that has not yet conceded a goal here,
he will have to rise to the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Lined up against him, Owen will find two other young talents _
although, by his standards, they are already veterans. Amaldo Ariel
Ortega, aged 24, has already shown here that he is one the finest
aggressive midfielders in the game. He scored two goals against
Jamaica with an insolent ease _ chipping the ball over the
goalkeeper first with his left and then with his right foot _ and
has been an inspiration to his side.
</P>
<P>
   Marcelo Gallardo, aged 22, may start as a substitute, but it is
not for nothing that he has already been compared to Maradona. Like
the great Argentine star of the 1980s, he has a low center of
gravity and can move past players as if they did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Owen, with one goal in the tournament so far, has a long way to
go if he is to catch up with the top scorer, Christian Vieri of
Italy. While scarcely a newcomer, Vieri, aged 25, has burst on the
scene with a new authority, scoring in every match and placing even
Italy's star strikers, Roberto Baggio and Alessandro Del Piero, in
his shadow.
</P>
<P>
   Vieri, who grew up in Australia and speaks modest Italian, has
five goals so far. If Owen wants to get anywhere near that, and not
return home on Wednesday, he knows what he has to do against
Argentina. Facing him will be perhaps the best defense in the
world, but Owen has lived and thrived by surprising people.

MARVIN GIROUARD, NEW PIER 1 CEO, MADE HIS MARK BY TRAVELING THE
WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MITCHELL SCHNURMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Marvin Girouard is probably not your
father's idea of a chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth's newest CEO, who took over last week at Pier 1
Imports, likes to talk about his rock 'n' roll days as a teen and
the time he hitchhiked to New Orleans with Janis Joplin.
</P>
<P>
   He traces his sense of style to a maverick grandfather who ran
gambling and prostitution houses during the Texas oil boom. He is
so tickled by celebrities that he decorates his office wall with
autographed photos of Meg Ryan and Katie Couric.
</P>
<P>
   But Girouard (pronounced Gerard) has substance as well as
sizzle. He was senior class president at Texas A&AMP;M, a member of the
cadet corps and later a Navy commando in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In the business world, he has been a globe-hopping merchant who
knew which village in Malaysia could produce 10,000 inlaid boxes in
time for the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   And he has been a loyal corporate employee, shunning offers to
lead other retailers and keeping his composure when an outsider was
once picked to run the company instead of him.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is not widely known outside his industry, for 23
years Girouard has worked in key roles for Pier 1, the Fort
Worth-based retailer that does more than a billion dollars in
annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Girouard initially oversaw the worldwide buying that came to
define the home furnishings retailer. For the past decade, he has
been the No. 2 executive who kept operations on track.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, less than two months shy of his 59th birthday,
Girouard finally grabbed the brass ring: He was named chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pier 1 had everything I wanted,'' Girouard said, explaining
why he hung in so long. ``It's like falling in love with a woman or
a beautiful car. Once you find the one you want, you'll wait
forever to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Girouard's climb up the corporate ladder is a tribute to
patience, persistence and loyalty, traits that may seem at odds
with a country-singing Aggie who collects German sports cars and
Rolex watches.
</P>
<P>
   But Girouard often seems to be an odd mix of flash and
conservatism. He made his mark by traveling the world, but once
refused to take a job _ even though he had children and was
unemployed _ because it would force him to move from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   He owns three Porsches, wears Italian suits and buys custom-made
shirts in Hong Kong. But his favorite reading includes the National
Enquirer and the Star tabloids, and a top hobby is collecting
baseball cards.
</P>
<P>
   Girouard is not physically imposing and admits that he was never
a great athlete. But he led a Navy commando unit in Vietnam,
parachuting onto beaches and swimming up rivers.
</P>
<P>
   In his early days at Pier 1, he was known as ``The Night
Fighter.'' During an uptempo moment at one meeting, an executive
challenged everyone to a push-up contest. Girouard blew away the
competition when he sprang to the floor and started doing them
one-handed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a quiet man,'' said Bob Bolen, the former Fort
Worth mayor and Hallmark store owner who frequently swaps retailing
tales with Girouard. ``His nature is to make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Girouard applied to Pier 1 in 1975, he had to fill out a
standard job form, and one line asked how he would get to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my Porsche!'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, he was overseeing the company's worldwide
buying, which had him scouring the globe for the trinkets,
housewares and rattan furniture that became Pier 1's trademark.
</P>
<P>
   As Pier 1 began to improve in the early '80s, his role became
increasingly important. With the company adding stores and
upgrading its product line, Girouard not only had to find
interesting, low-cost items, he also had to build the Asian supply
connections that could keep the inventories full.
</P>
<P>
   When Pier 1 picked a new top executive in 1980, Girouard had
hoped to be the choice. He wasn't. Five years later, when the chief
executive left, Girouard made a pitch directly to the board. Again
he was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Girouard said he felt like the builder and owner of
Pier 1, he conceded, ``Now I know that I didn't have the vision or
the experience that this job demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore. For the past decade, Girouard has been Pier 1's
strong second-in-command, earning more than $1.2 million last year
and serving as a complement to top executive Clark Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who led Pier 1 for 13 years, stepped aside last week
and became nonexecutive chairman. The two were not close friends
away from the office, but they made a strong team, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was Mr. Outside, a smooth, formal executive who refined
Pier 1's public persona and sharpened the strategy that made it one
of the country's leading speciality retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Girouard was Mr. Inside, a scrappy operations man who can find
almost any item almost anywhere in the world.

GREATEST SOURCE OF DANGER IN NATIONAL PARKS IS NOT NATURE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where are you more likely to be injured: climbing down a rock
face or sitting around the campsite? The rock face may seem like
the obvious answer, but a new study of the hazards of national
parks has found that injuries at campsites _ from fist fights to
substance abuse _ outnumber those sustained during rock climbing by
more than 3 to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, a University of California at San Diego study of eight
national parks in the state found that the greatest source of
danger is not nature. Only 3 of the 78 fatalities recorded were
attributed to ``purely environmental'' causes _ 1 apiece for shark
attack, avalanche, and inhalation of volcanic fumes.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the bulk of the fatalities stemmed from the same
weaknesses of the human heart and head that make life chancy in
civilized locations. Heart disease was the leading cause of death
(16), followed by drownings (12), falls (12), and motor vehicle
accidents (8). Men accounted for 80 percent of the fatalities,
including all 5 suicides.
</P>
<P>
   Animal attacks did show up on the list of injuries. But insects
were the most fiercesome group, accounting for 78 illnesses or
injuries, compared with 8 bites by larger creatures.

OPTIMISM'S BRIGHT SIDE: A HEALTHY, LONGER LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SUSAN GILBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   People who look on the bright side have reason to be optimistic.
Evidence suggests that they have healthier, longer lives than their
gloom-and-doom counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   For years, research has shown that optimists weather coronary
bypass surgery better and live longer with HIV. Now a new study
suggests that positive thoughts are also good for healthy people.
</P>
<P>
   When under tremendous, unrelenting stress _ in this case, the
first semester of law school _ students who were optimistic about
doing well had more T-cells and natural killer cell activity than
they had before the semester began. These immune factors, which
help thwart infection, showed little change in the pessimists.
</P>
<P>
   The findings strengthen the notion that thoughts and feelings
can affect the immune system, said Dr. Suzanne Segerstrom, an
assistant professor of psychology at the University of Kentucky in
Lexington and the lead author of the study, which appears in the
June issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Other research has found that the more stress people experience,
the more likely they are to get colds. And the new work raises the
possibility that optimism may help prevent people from getting sick
during stressful times, Dr. Segerstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study provides an important link in the optimism
literature: immunological data,'' said Dr. Janice Kiecolt-Glaser, a
professor of psychiatry at Ohio State University College of
Medicine in Columbus. Dr. Kiecolt-Glaser and her husband, Dr.
Ronald Glaser, study how stress and emotions affect the immune
system.
</P>
<P>
   The study followed 90 healthy students just before they started
law school through the middle of their first semesters, a
notoriously stressful period. In the beginning, blood tests
revealed that all of the students had comparable levels of T-cells
and natural killer cell activity. These measurements were repeated
eight weeks later to see whether they had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, each student filled out questionnaires that gauged
two kinds of optimism: dispositional optimism, the students'
expectations about life in general, and situational optimism, their
expectations for success in law school specifically.
</P>
<P>
   An example of dispositional optimism is agreeing with the
phrase, ``In uncertain times, I usually expect the best.''
Situational optimism is reflected in this statement about law
school, ``It's unlikely that I will fail.''
</P>
<P>
   Though situational optimists also tend to be dispositional
optimists, the relationship is not perfect, explained Dr. Shelley
Taylor, a co-author and psychology professor at the University of
California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some immediate social factors can give you a sense of optimism
about your situation, like whether there are things in your
environment that give you a sense of hope,'' she said. ``But
dispositional optimism has a moderate genetic basis and is not easy
to modify. By the time you're 25, you're not going to affect
dispositional optimism a whole lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The study found that the more optimistic the students were, the
greater the increase in the immune system measurements. But the
relationship was strongest for situational optimism.
</P>
<P>
   The number of T-cells rose by 13 percent in the situational
optimists but dropped by 3 percent in the situational pessimists.
Natural killer cell activity was up 42 percent in the situational
optimists but it increased by just 9 percent in the situational
pessimists.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Segerstrom said that she was not surprised that situational
optimism was more closely tied to the immune system than
dispositional optimism, because it reflected the students'
attitudes about the stressful situation at hand, law school.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, research by Dr. Taylor and others had found
situational optimism beneficial for men with HIV. In a 1994 study,
men with HIV who thought that their illness could be controlled
showed increased T-cell counts over time and lived nine months
longer than men with negative expectations, Dr. Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   In a study to be published this year, she found that
HIV-positive men without symptoms who were pessimistic about their
condition had a drop in T-cells and faster onset of symptoms than
men who were optimistic, whose T-cell counts stayed about the same.
</P>
<P>
   The study on the law students left two unanswered questions. One
is why the optimists' immune systems got stronger once the pressure
was on. The researchers suspected that the optimists had healthier
attitudes and habits than the pessimists, that they perceived less
stress, had less intense mood disturbances, exercised more and
avoided smoking and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   But while the optimists did have these healthy traits, as
measured by questionnaires assessing health-related traits, only
mood and stress had any bearing on the immune system measurements,
and it was small.
</P>
<P>
   Mood accounted for part of the increase in T-cells and none of
the increase in natural killer cell activity. Perceived stress
explained part of the increase in natural killer cell activity and
none of the increase in T-cells, Dr. Segerstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This suggests that there's something we didn't measure about
optimism that explains the immune system effects,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The other unanswered question is whether the immune system
factors went up enough in the optimistic law students to reduce
their risk of contracting colds or other infections. Though
comparable increases have affected the course of illness in people
whose immune systems were weakened by poor health, it is not known
whether they would have any effect on healthy people, Dr.
Segerstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most encouraging news from the study is that the
brand of optimism that proved key is not a hard-wired personality
trait, but something that pessimists can adopt with a little help,
psychologists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's ample evidence that pessimists can become more
optimistic,'' said Dr. Christopher Peterson, a psychology professor
at the University of Michigan who has studied optimism.
</P>
<P>
   One way is with cognitive therapy, he said, which gets people to
identify and change habitually negative thoughts. Self-help
techniques can also teach people how to improve aspects of their
lives, like their friendships or study habits.
</P>
<P>
   Situational optimism and pessimism usually reflect people's
circumstances, he added. ``You can't just tell people to be more
optimistic if their life stinks,'' he said. ``Better to give them
the tools to change their lives, and then change their outlook.'' &QL;

SCIENCE AND RELIGION: BRIDGING THE GREAT DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By GEORGE JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ever since science began drifting away from religion, centuries
ago, each has dreamed of subsuming the other. Scientists, in their
boldest moments, speak of explaining away all the mysteries by
empirical inquiry, leaving no need for ancient wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   And the faithful, fervently believing in spiritual forces
nmeasurable by any meter, find it absurd that God's children would
aspire to heaven solely by building telescopes and computers _
scientific Towers of Babel. They have longed for a reality beyond
the shadowplay of the material realm.
</P>
<P>
   Left between these extremes are many people who are both
scientific and religious, and confused about whether a bridge can
ever cross the divide. Every few decades, this hope for
reconciliation, or ``dialogue,'' experiences a revival.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent may be the biggest, with books, conferences and
television shows trying to find a common ground between two
fundamentally different ways of thinking about the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s scholars tried to merge science with Eastern
religion; the emphasis now is on rejoining science with
monotheistic, usually Christian, faith.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the work is motivated by religious passion. In his
best-selling book, ``Consilience'' (Knopf, 1998), the Harvard
biologist Dr. Edward O. Wilson tries to revive the Enlightenment
dream of a unified system of knowledge that would embrace not only
the sciences but also morality and ethics, removing them from the
uncertainties of religion. Here the effort is not to make science
spiritual but to make religion scientific.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the longing for reconciliation comes from the
religious side. With a $3 million grant from the John Templeton
Foundation, which is fueling much of the metaphysics boom with its
considerable resources, a modest newsletter on science and religion
was reborn this year as a glossy magazine called Science &AMP; Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a growing number of individuals looking toward religion
to explain what science cannot, and asking science to validate
religious teachings,'' the publisher, Kevin Sharpe, said.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, PBS will broadcast ``Faith and Reason,'' a
documentary written and narrated by Margaret Wertheim and partly
financed with $190,000 from the Templeton Foundation, featuring
interviews with scientists about God. In the last two years, a
steady stream of books with titles like ``Cybergrace: The Search
for God in the Digital World'' and ``God &AMP; the Big Bang:
Discovering Harmony Between Science &AMP; Spirituality'' has been
published.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most conspicuous events was the heavily promoted
conference called ``Science and the Spiritual Quest,'' held this
month in Berkeley, Calif., by the Center for Theology and the
Natural Sciences. The Templeton Foundation gave the center $1.4
million for the conference.
</P>
<P>
   For four days scientists, most of them Christians, Jews or
Moslems, testified about their efforts to resolve personal
conflicts over science and religion. All seemed to share the
conviction that this is a purposeful universe, that there is a
reason to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theology is not some airy-fairy form of metaphysical
speculation,'' said John C. Polkinghorne, a Cambridge University
particle physicist turned Anglican priest whose books include
``Quarks, Chaos &AMP; Christianity'' and the newly published ``Belief
in God in an Age of Science.'' Like science, he said, religion is
rooted in encounters with reality _ though in the latter case
encounters include spiritual revelations whose truths lie in the
unreachable realm of the subjective. The pervading question was
whether this kind of experience could ever be studied
scientifically.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the century people have espoused the view that
science and religion should be kept apart to avoid the inevitable
combustions. But to rational minds it has always been troubling
that two opposing ways could exist to explain the same universe.
</P>
<P>
   Science and religion spring from the human obsession with
finding order in the world. But surely there can be only one true
explanation for reality. Life was either created or it evolved.
Prayer is either communication with God or a psychological salve.
The universe is either pervaded by spiritual forces or ruled by
nothing but physical laws.
</P>
<P>
   One way out of the dilemma has been to embrace a kind of deism:
The Almighty created the universe according to certain
specifications and then left it to run on its own. ``God'' becomes
a metaphor for the laws that science tries to uncover.
</P>
<P>
   Or religion can be explained away scientifically. ``There is a
hereditary selective advantage to membership in a powerful group
united by devout belief and purpose,'' Wilson wrote in
``Consilience.'' He warned against letting this genetically
ingrained drive overpower the intellect. ``If history and science
have taught us anything, it is that passion and desire are not the
same as truth. The human mind evolved to believe in the gods. It
did not evolve to believe in biology.'' It is important not to
confuse the universe as it is with the universe as we wish it would
be.
</P>
<P>
   For many scientists, the point of the scientific enterprise is
to replace religious teachings with verifiable theories, and to
pretend otherwise is self-delusion. ``We're working on building up
a complete picture of the universe, which, if we succeed, will be a
complete understanding of the universe and everything that's in
it,'' Richard Dawkins, a University of Oxford biologist, said in a
preview copy of ``Faith and Reason.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He found it baffling that some of his colleagues struggle to
keep God in the picture, ``I don't understand why they waste their
time going into this other stuff, which never has added anything to
the storehouse of human wisdom, and I don't see that it ever
will.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like the cosmologist Dr. Allan Sandage, have found
that their search for objective truth has led them to questions
that science cannot answer. ``The most amazing thing to me is
existence itself,'' Sandage said at the Berkeley conference. ``Why
is there something instead of nothing?'' He said this impenetrable
mystery drove him to become a believer. ``How is it that inanimate
matter can organize itself to contemplate itself? That's outside of
any science I know.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Science, like religion, is ultimately built on a platform of
beliefs and assumptions. No one can prove that the universe is
mathematical or that the same laws that seem to hold in the here
and now can be applied to the distant quasars or to the first
moments of time. These are among the tenets of the faith, marking
the point at which reasoning can begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Science is not able to question these issues,'' Dr. George
Ellis, a professor of applied mathematics at the University of
Capetown and a Quaker, said at the conference. ``It takes them for
granted as its bedrock.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just the coincidence of the approaching millennium
that is inspiring hopes for what would be the grandest unified
theory. Faced with science's undeniable success in modeling the
world, people find it harder to accept religious teachings that
cannot be verified.
</P>
<P>
   Many Christians were disturbed when radiocarbon dating suggested
that the Shroud of Turin was not Jesus' burial cloth but a medieval
forgery, and they hope that new scientific data, not religious
fiat, will overturn the old research. Even the creationists
realized long ago that they can't sway the opposition simply by
asserting that their beliefs are true because they are written in
the Bible. They proffer scientific proof _ pseudoscientific, those
outside the faith would say _ that life and the universe were
created as described in Genesis.
</P>
<P>
   But science, too, is feeling its limits, leaving a vacuum that
religion is happy to rush into. Neuroscientists can explain the
brain, on a rough level, as networks of communicating cells called
neurons. But it is hard to imagine a satisfying theory of the
conscious experience _ what it is like to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   And no amount of theorizing is apt to converge on a persuasive
explanation of where the mathematical laws are written or what
happened before the Big Bang. Humans can observe and reason, but
ultimately the mind encounters chasms. Then the only choice is to
retreat or take the great leap and choose what to believe.
</P>
<P>
   For all the genuine philosophical longings, the recent drive to
put God back in science would not be nearly so intense without the
millions of Templeton dollars looking for places to land. ``We are
searching for a serious rapprochement between science and
religion,'' Charles Harper, the executive director and vice
president of the Templeton Foundation, said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   The money and the inspiration come from the investor John Marks
Templeton, founder of the Templeton Growth Fund and other ventures,
who retired in 1992 to work fulltime on his philanthropy. The most
prominent of Sir John's endeavors (he was knighted in 1987) is the
annual Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, guaranteed to
exceed the Nobel Prizes in monetary value. (Templeton thought
Alfred Nobel snubbed spirituality.)
</P>
<P>
   Early winners of the Templeton award, first given in 1973, were
usually religious leaders like Mother Teresa. More recently the
prizes, now more than $1 million, have gone to the political
scientist Michael Novak and the physicist and science writer Paul
Davies.
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Theology and the Natural Sciences in Berkeley is
receiving $12.6 million from Templeton to help develop science and
religion programs at universities. The American Association for the
Advancement of Science received $1.3 million ``to help establish a
science and religion dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the foundation's announcement that it would award
grants of $100,000 to $200,000 for a program in ``forgiveness
studies'' sent behavioral scientists scrambling to write proposals.
Among the work being funded are, ``Forgiveness and Community: A
Game-Theoretic Analysis,'' ``Assessment of Forgiveness:
Psychometric, Interpersonal, and Psychophysiological Correlates''
and ``Does Forgiveness Enhance Brain Activation Associated with
Empathy in Victims of Assault?''
</P>
<P>
   Those who submitted proposals were asked to include a section
about how their research would address the issues clarified in
Templeton's books ``Discovering the Laws of Life'' and ``Worldwide
Laws of Life: 200 Eternal Spiritual Principles.''
</P>
<P>
   A major focus of the foundation is publishing some 20 works by
and about Templeton. The foundation is also encouraging scientific
research on what its literature describes as ``optimism, hope and
personal control.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the conference, no amount of money is likely to
succeed in blending science and religion into a common pursuit. A
kind of Sunday school politeness pervaded the meeting, with none of
the impassioned confrontations expected from such an emotionally
charged subject.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the speakers have been preaching to the choir,''
Sandage complained. ``There are no atheists on the program, only
strict believers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the speakers avoided grappling with religion directly,
content to ponder mysteries that have disturbed scientists for
decades. The Stanford University cosmologist, Andrei Linde,
speculated on the tantalizing possibility that consciousness, the
very hallmark of humanity, could be an intrinsic part of the
universe _ as fundamental to the warp and woof of creation as space
and time. After all, he said, our subjective experience is the only
thing each of us is really sure of. All else is speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our knowledge of the world begins not with matter but with
perceptions,'' Linde argued. ``I know for sure that my pain exists,
my `green' exists, and my `sweet' exists. I do not need any proof
of their existence, because these events are a part of me;
everything else is a theory.'' It is to explain the source of these
perceptions that we posit the existence of an outside reality,
forgetting that this is just a supposition.
</P>
<P>
   The existence of a real world is another of the tenets of the
scientific faith. It is impossible to proceed without it. But many
scientists would find the view that consciousness is the root of
everything to be hopelessly anthropomorphic and even solipsistic.
</P>
<P>
   The conference might also have booked prominent scientists, like
Stephen Jay Gould, who argue that consciousness, as powerful as it
necessarily seems to its holders, may be just an accident of
evolution. Behind consciousness, one can choose to find God. Or
not. Without a decisive experiment, it is a matter of personal
belief not of science.
</P>
<P>
   The astrophysicist Dr. John Barrow of the University of Sussex
spoke of another longstanding mystery: the cosmological
coincidences that make life possible. If certain physical constants
had slightly different values, stars would not have formed to cook
up the atoms that made the biological molecules.
</P>
<P>
   Since early in the century some truth seekers have taken this
sort of argument as a reason to believe that the universe was
created with people in mind.
</P>
<P>
   But one is also free to choose the opposite belief: that the
coincidences simply show that life is indeed an incredible fluke.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to know what to make of some of the presentations.
Dr. Mitchell Marcus, chairman of the computer science department at
the University of Pennsylvania, speculated that the craft of
artificial intelligence _ designing thinking computers _ is a
modern realization of the school of Jewish mysticism based on the
Kabala.
</P>
<P>
   According to this ancient teaching, it is not quarks and leptons
but the first 10 numbers and the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet
that are the true fundamental particles: the elements of the divine
utterance that gave rise to creation. ``Computer scientists,'' he
declared, ``are the Kabba lists of today.''
</P>
<P>
   The ancient rabbis are said to have used magical incantations to
create beings called golems. The programmers create their simulated
creatures with incantations of computer code.
</P>
<P>
   The audience politely applauded after each presentation. But
there was little sense of intellectual excitement, that people were
coming to grips with the disturbing issue of whether there really
is a God.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the presentations consisted more simply of heartfelt
testimonials about the difficulties of constantly being pulled by
two powerfully conflicting attractions, the material and the
spiritual, the known and the unknowable. And some of the speakers
seemed to believe that, for all the efforts to bring them together,
science and religion must inevitably go their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would I do science differently if I weren't a Quaker?'' asked
Dr. Jocelyn Bell Burnell, chairwoman of the physics department of
the Open University in England. ``I don't think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandage, the cosmologist, matter of factly put it like this: ``I
don't go to a biology book to learn how to live. I don't go to the
Bible to learn about science.''
</P>
<P>
   As science continues to draw its picture of the physical world,
each question it answers will inevitably raise more. So there will
always be mysteries, the voids in human knowledge where religious
awe can grow.

FIRST AID OR NOT?

<P>
   Q. Whatever happened to Mercurochrome and Merthiolate? How do
they work?
</P>
<P>
   A. Mercurochrome is a trade name for merbromin, a compound
containing mercury and bromine. Merthiolate is a trade name for
thimerosal, a compound containing mercury and sodium. Both these
compounds kill some (but not all) disease-causing microbes by
denaturing enzymes and other proteins so that the microbes'
metabolism is blocked; they do this by breaking up chemical bonds
in the proteins.
</P>
<P>
   Both have been widely used as topical antiseptics, applied to
the surface of the skin of a living body. Thimerosal is still often
used to help rid skin of bacteria before medical procedures.
Mercurochrome is not widely used anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mercurochrome and Merthiolate (and iodine preparations,
too) sting when applied to broken skin and can interfere with
healing. Experts now recommend that first aid kits contain newer
antibacterial creams, especially those containing bacitracins, a
class of antibacterials first produced by other microorganisms.
</P>
<P>
   A cut or scrape should first be washed with soap and water, and
the first-aid cream should be put on with a sterile applicator,
like a cotton swab, when the injury is clean and dry.

moving closer to becoming a fighter pilot. His former fiancee,
Diane Zamora, would be on the same track at the Naval Academy, her
goal of being an astronaut still intact. And for Adrianne Jones,
senior prom would be fresh in her mind as she prepared to leave
Mansfield for her first year at Texas A&AMP;M, where she hoped to study
psychology. Now, four months after Zamora was sentenced to life in

   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a new seminary student, Julie

pray for all the poor women who thought they were being called to
become pastors.'' A year later, as she delved into studies in
theology, philosophy and languages, she said she found biblical
evidence that a woman can lead a church. ``I think deep inside I
had always thought, `This is a crock. God loves us the same,' ''
she said. In 1985, Pennington-Russell became associate pastor of
19th Avenue Baptist Church, a 90-member congregation tucked between
San Francisco's crowded row houses. In 1993, she agreed to become
the church's senior pastor. Now, Pennington-Russell is preparing to
come to Texas as the state's first female senior pastor of a
Southern Baptist church, stoking a debate that has divided Baptist
conservatives and moderates since the mid-1980s. By KRISTIN N.

RECOGNIZING WHAT'S REAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If scientists are too rigid in ignoring phenomena that cannot be
explained by standard theories, they risk ignoring hints that may
lead to new and better theories. But chasing every ``X-File''
anomaly guarantees wasting a lot of time.
</P>
<P>
   How can one tell the difference between real science and
pursuits that may have the form, but generally not the content, of
science, like parapsychology?
</P>
<P>
   One test is having a good theory to explain the alleged
phenomena, writes philosopher Paul M. Churchland, co-author of ``On
the Contrary,'' a book of essays published by the MIT Press. The
articles in parapsychology journals report many studies of strange
mental powers imputed to humans or animals, but offer little
explanation of why such properties should exist.
</P>
<P>
   Another test is whether the field's usually rare claims of
success were repeated in a second laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   These rules might be worth the attention of the Society for
Scientific Exploration, which last week issued a report on
unidentified flying objects. The document, written by a panel of
nine scientists chaired by Von R. Eshleman of Stanford University,
concluded that ``it may be valuable'' to explore UFO sightings in
the hope of extracting ``information about unusual phenomena
currently unknown to science.''
</P>
<P>
   The authors discuss several mysterious encounters in which
pilots and others have noticed glowing lights, gigantic disks and
other perplexing objects.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists conclude that some episodes can be explained by
known natural phenomena but that others, which are harder to
account for, are worth investigating further.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there are unexplained observations, there is the
possibility that scientists will learn something new by studying
those observations,'' the report states. But in terms of
Churchland's test, the authors offer no theory to account for the
unexplained sightings, and according to a press release issued by
Stanford University, they are ``not convinced'' by the theory that
would explain the alleged episodes, the thesis of extraterrestrial
visitations.
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UFOs aside, there seem to be enough weird goings on within the
portals of accepted science. Take the method of dating ancient
Indian rock art, known as petroglyphs, by means of the pollen and
other carbon-containing dust said to be trapped beneath the rock
varnish.
</P>
<P>
   Several paintings, which bear on the timing of the first
colonization of the Americas, have been dated by Dr. Ronald I.
Dorn, a pioneer of the rock varnish method at Arizona State
University.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the method write in the current issue of Science that
they found particles of coal and charcoal in samples prepared by
Dorn but not in samples from the same sites that were collected
independently. The coal and charcoal grains were of different ages,
raising a question as to how both had been incorporated into the
same rock varnish.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy reply, Dorn adamantly denies that he tampered with
his samples and states that his critics ``failed to replicate my
results because they did not duplicate my techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorn states that coal and carbon are found together under rock
varnish. It would be absurd for anyone intent on cheating to mix
together carbon-bearing materials of different ages, he writes,
``instead of just using homogeneous materials with desired ages.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some mysteries, of course, have robust, scientific explanations
but depend on the human propensity for self-deception to be seen as
supernatural. The trick in fire-walking, Churchland notes, is that
there is no trick.
</P>
<P>
   The coals are red-hot and the fire-walkers tread on them,
usually without injury. People expect to be burned by anything
incandescent, but the coals, if carefully prepared and at a late
stage of combustion, have the density of styrofoam and hold too
little heat to burn the skin if touched quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The spectacle depends on expert preparation of the coals, and on
indoctrinating the walkers to swathe their feet in bio-magnetic
energy that repels the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Do not try this trick at home, Churchland warns. Careful
preparation is a necessity, as much in science as in the delicate
art of deceiving others.

CHEATING ON DRIVER'S LICENSE TEST COMMON 
</HEADLINE>
 DRIVERS-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHASHANK BENGALI  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Kansas City, Mo.) _ Silently and in seemingly one swift
movement, two uniformed officers of the Missouri Highway Patrol
surrounded the perpetrator.
</P>
<P>
   An officer shook the man's hand free of pencil and paper and
revealed the crime: test answers scrawled between his left index
and middle fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The twentysomething offender had joined the swelling ranks of
those caught _ some red-handed _ cheating on their driver's license
test.
</P>
<P>
   Every week at testing stations throughout Missouri and Kansas,
cheaters of all ages are caught and their tests confiscated. Unlike
in school, however, where such an offense might warrant detention
or worse, the penalty for cheating in either state is little more
than some embarrassment and a slap on the wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Officials insist that the punishment fits the crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we should be arresting people because they
cheated,'' said Fount Foushee, a chief examiner with the Missouri
Highway Patrol, which administers the test.
</P>
<P>
   Foushee points out that the written test is only part of the
licensing process. First-time drivers, and those with expired,
suspended or revoked licenses, also must take the road test, which
three-quarters of Missouri applicants passed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A poor score on the written test doesn't necessarily equate with
a poor driver, Foushee said. Many applicants have gone from a
barely passing score on the written test to nearly perfect results
on the road test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The written test tells you that you have the knowledge to
drive. The road test shows that you actually can drive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the testing station, where the cheating incident occurred
last Monday, supervisor Ethel Mae Caldwell said applicants who did
not take the test seriously might not take driving seriously,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a good indication for you if you cheat. I really
don't think we're letting bad drivers fall through, but I wish more
people took the time to study the rules,'' said Caldwell, who
catches ``a couple'' of cheaters each week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like it if there would be a stiffer penalty for
cheating,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Test administrators also say security procedures haven't kept
pace with increasingly creative cheaters. In a new twist on the
age-old methods _ writing the answers on a crib sheet or the bill
of a cap _ one recent culprit programmed his calculator watch with
the answers but gave himself away, Caldwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would check the time every few seconds,'' Caldwell said,
``so we knew something was up.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states are cracking down. In California the number of
English-language test versions recently was doubled to 10 and the
number of Spanish versions increased to five from three.
</P>
<P>
   California's new measures resulted from several undercover
operations by the state's Highway Patrol. Some troopers said they
cited about a dozen cheaters a month. And state officials reported
a black market for crib sheets that cost as much as $500.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, where an applicant can take the test twice in a
day, cheaters are barred from taking the exam again that day, but
they are allowed to return the next day with a clean slate. They
can take the test as often as they need until they pass.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas laws limit the number of times an applicant can take the
test at four. After that, they must wait six months before they are
eligible to take it again.
</P>
<P>
   No formal records of cheaters are kept in either state, and
officials acknowledge that many get away with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't catch 10 percent of the cheaters,'' said Foushee.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas officials say cheating isn't a significant concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't believe we have a problem here,'' said Alan
Anderson, chief examiner with the Kansas Division of Vehicles,
which administers the test. ``I've been here for 17 years, even
worked in the testing stations, and never saw that it was a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Kansas testing protocol discourages cheating. Test
answers aren't allowed out of the office, which he said makes
memorizing them more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But no security measures will entirely deter cheating, Foushee
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started here in 1970, and people cheated then,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Missouri and Kansas update the 25-question, multiple-choice
tests about every 12 months to account for changes in driving laws.
Missouri's current versions date to December 1997. Kansas will
introduce new tests the first week of July.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, four English versions of the test exist, and one
for each of 10 foreign languages, including Spanish, Chinese and
Russian. Kansas has two English-language versions, and none in a
foreign language. Kansas has bilingual examiners who will translate
for Spanish-speaking applicants and also offers a nonverbal picture
test for those who speak other languages.
</P>
<P>
   In California's attack on cheating, the tests will be changed
four times a year, but officials in Missouri and Kansas don't think
that's practical, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're changing the test that often, it becomes a
management issue and a question of logistics, and in our state it
can get very difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the limited number of versions makes it easier to cheat.
Repeat test-takers can memorize answers or share them with others.
The offender caught Monday said he got the answers from ``a
friend'' who had come in a week earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same test,'' he said in Spanish. ``Last time I made
too many mistakes. This time, less.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not alone. Missouri's failure rate seems remarkably high.
</P>
<P>
   In Foushee's 16-county region last year, 48 percent failed the
test and Kansas City's rate is usually several points higher.
Anderson estimated that the passing rate in Kansas, however, hovers
steadily about 75 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Kansas City testing station, some applicants this
week said that passing the test _ answering 80 percent of the 25
questions correctly _ just requires a little effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty easy test,'' said David Ulett, 26, who said he
didn't study but passed his renewal examination anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Caldwell, a 25-year veteran of the testing office, said: ``I
honestly believe that if they took the time to prepare themselves,
and didn't just come in blindly, they'd all pass.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, the man caught cheating said he had been
embarrassed into reform: ``I did a bad thing. I won't do it next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   On his way out of the office, he grabbed a copy of Missouri's
80-page driver's manual.
</P>
<P>
   ``To read,'' he said.

NETWORKS FOR SUPER-LINKED FAMILIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the planet becomes increasingly networked, shrinking the
globe and redefining age-old concepts of community, all this
digital connectivity has so far bypassed our most fundamental
social unit, the family. Now, a rapidly emerging new industry is
betting that the next ``killer app'' will be a network in your
home.
</P>
<P>
   Already, according to the Dataquest research firm, two or more
computers are being used in an estimated 15 million American
households, a number that is expected to more than triple by 2002.
The assumption that people will want all those computers to talk to
each other, from bedroom to den to living room, kitchen, deck and
patio, has touched off a race for a chunk of a what Wedbush Morgan
Securities of Los Angeles estimates will be a $4 billion market
within four years.
</P>
<P>
   My own family contributed a few hundred dollars to the
beginnings of that market last month when it became clear that
installing a home network would cost a lot less than buying modems,
Internet access and printers for each the four computers
accumulated by three students and two increasingly Net-dependent
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The deciding factor, though, was the introduction of a cable
modem into the household. Always connected and delivering incoming
data at better than 60 times the speed of today's fastest modems,
it quickly made the Internet the children's primary reference
library as well as a social and entertainment hub.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a bottleneck. The cable modem is connected to the
same multimedia PC that runs the color printer, the scanner and,
most importantly, a CD-ROM changer with an encyclopedia, an atlas,
a dictionary and other reference books.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the vast majority of our digital resources were
available only to the family member who happened to be using that
one machine. Simple efficiency, not to mention domestic harmony,
demanded that they be shared.
</P>
<P>
   That, says John W. Todd, Wedbush Morgan's vice president for
research, is a typical set of reasons for installing a home
network.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely shared Internet access that will drive the
home networking market,'' said Todd, who recently released an
investment analysis on the subject. ``But in addition, people are
quickly realizing that they can't afford to equip every computer in
the house with a complete set of peripherals.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapidly falling prices for network cards and ethernet hubs, the
equipment needed for the kind of high-speed network typically used
in corporate environments, now make it possible to connect two home
computers for less than $200 _ but only if both machines happen to
be in the same room.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest expense faced by would-be home networkers today is
the cost of running ethernet cables through walls, floors and
ceilings. Wiring a typical home can easily cost several thousand
dollars. I took this route because I am comfortable doing my own
wiring, but by the end of this summer, consumers will have a choice
of several easier, less costly alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   The best features of all these new schemes is that they will
require no new wiring and most will configure themselves _ a
significant breakthrough, since setting up a network is a more than
daunting challenge for most weekend warriors.
</P>
<P>
   While none of these new systems will deliver the 10 to 100
megabits per second bandwidth of a cable-connected ethernet (at
least not yet) they will offer speeds up to 1.6 megabits per
second, about 30 times faster than today's fastest modems.
</P>
<P>
   They will arrive in three basic flavors: wireless, phone-line
systems and power-line systems.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless networks use a high-frequency radio signal to connect
computers equipped with tiny two-way radios, or transceivers. While
these are prone to interference from other radio sources, they will
be by far the most attractive options when the technology is
mature.
</P>
<P>
   One system is already on the market, but faster, more reliable
systems will be introduced later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   For the foreseeable future, systems that use a home's existing
telephone lines _ without interfering with normal telephone use _
will be the most dependable and among the fastest and lowest cost.
The most developed of the home network technologies, they inspired
the creation earlier this month of the Home Phoneline Networking
Alliance, a standards group that includes industry giants like
AT&AMP;T, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, it also includes 3Com, Lucent Technologies and
Rockwell Semiconductor Systems, indicating that these three
companies learned a hard lesson when their years of sparring over a
standard all but destroyed the market for 56K modems.
</P>
<P>
   Systems that use existing electrical wiring employ the oldest
technology and, to date, are the more expensive and least
dependable of the home networks under development. But they are
also the most promising because of the ubiquitous nature of
electrical wiring in every room in most homes. Look for systems of
this type by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   None of these systems is likely to be really mature and
glitch-free for several years, but even in their primordial stages,
they will nurture the emergence, for better or worse, of the
super-connected family.

TWO WORDS FOR JUSTICES: GET REAL 
</HEADLINE>
 WORK COLUMN-KAN   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. Supreme Court justices understand a lot of things, but
teen-agers aren't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   In the same week that the court strengthened the position of
employees in sexual harassment lawsuits, it made it extremely
difficult for youngsters to win damages from school districts even
if ``reprehensible'' abuse has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled in a 5-4 decision that school districts cannot
be forced to pay damages to a student who was sexually abused by a
teacher because officials did not know of the abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students essentially have no protection because the (legal)
standards are so high,'' said Neena Chaudhry, a staff attorney with
the National Women's Law Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it is almost impossible for students to win
monetary damages unless someone ``with authority'' knew about the
harassment and was ``deliberately indifferent.''
</P>
<P>
   As a teen would say: ``Get real.''
</P>
<P>
   Many adults have difficulty recognizing harassment, so how can
we expect teen-agers to be even better informed? In a survey of 83
high schools for the Iowa Commission on the Status of Women, focus
groups found that many students do not have a well-formed idea of
what constitutes sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked about specific examples of sexual harassment, the
same survey found that 83 percent of young women and 62 percent of
young men had at least one exposure to a sexually harassing
incident at school.
</P>
<P>
   The study also found that 19 percent of the young women and 8
percent of the young men were experiencing ongoing harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Did most of the youngsters tell their parents, teachers or
school administrators about the harassment? Of course not. The
average teen-ager doesn't even want to talk about sex with an
adult, let alone describe a personally humiliating experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of courage, whether the student is male or
female, to come forward,'' said Charlotte B. Nelson, executive
director of the Iowa Commission on Women.
</P>
<P>
   The National Women's Law Center is working with other
organizations to persuade Congress to remedy the high court's
ruling by revisiting Title IX.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds great, but we know that legislation takes months, if
not years.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, we should follow Iowa's example. We should
educate our teachers and teen-agers so they can recognize and
prevent harassment.
</P>
<P>
   After completing its survey, the Iowa Commission on the Status
of Women produced the film ``Stop It! Students Speak Out Against
Sexual Harassment.'' The film, which is available to schools, is
designed to encourage discussion.
</P>
<P>
   The courts obviously won't protect our children, so we must.

SAMPSON RESIGNS AS U.S. SOCCER COACH

<P>
   MONTPELLIER, France _ Four days after his divided team
unceremoniously exited the World Cup after three losses and and a
32d-place ranking out of 32 teams, Steve Sampson resigned Monday as
coach of the U.S. soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   In his three years as head coach, Sampson became the first
American ever to qualify the United States for the World Cup and he
provided some of the country's most important victories, including
a 1-0 win over Brazil in February.
</P>
<P>
   However, he radically changed the lineup in the months leading
up to the 1998 World Cup, dropped captain John Harkes and drew
severe criticism from veterans who had been benched.
</P>
<P>
   After the Americans lost all three first-round matches in the
World Cup and scored only one goal, Sampson was lambasted by such
players as Alexi Lalas and Tab Ramos, who said they would never
again play for the national team while Sampson was coach.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. soccer federation announced that it hoped to find a
replacement for Sampson within a month after the World Cup ends in
mid-July. The list of potential candidates includes two coaches
whom the federation attempted to hire before Sampson _ Carlos
Alberto Parreira, who led Brazil to the 1994 World Cup title and
was fired last week by Saudi Arabia; and Carlos Quieroz of
Portugal, who just left the U.S. team as head of player development
to coach the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   Also likely to be available is Bora Milutinovic, who coached the
Americans in the 1994 World Cup and is not expected to stay with
Nigeria now that it has been eliminated in the second round of the
1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Before the World Cup, many of the U.S. players said they liked
Sampson because he was an American and understood the mentality of
American players. If that preference leads the soccer federation to
hire another American coach, it would likely be Bruce Arena, coach
of D.C. United, the two-time champions of Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at the federation thank Steve for his tremendous service to
our national team program and to soccer in the USA,'' Alan I.
Rothenberg, president of the United States soccer federation, said
in a statement. ``His tireless work has helped advance our sport
and, on balance, it was an era of growth. I compliment him on his
achievements with the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who was hired on Aug. 2, 1995, coached the American
team to a 26-22-14 record. This spring, Harkes was removed for a
lack of leadership and discipline and such veterans as Lalas and
Marcelo Balboa were benched, while David Regis of France, who was
naturalized only three weeks before the World Cup, stepped in as a
replacement.
</P>
<P>
   After the team failed miserably in the World Cup, Sampson was
criticized for wrecking his team's cohesiveness and for using such
inexperienced players as Chad Deering and Brian Maisonneuve in
midfield. In truth, it was Sampson's most experienced players who
let him down most - Claudio Reyna in midfield and Eric Wynalda at
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the criticisms of Sampson were valid. He did not
recognize that Reyna was incapable of leading the team. And he
played with no defensive midfielders against Iran, which
contributed mightily to a 2-1 defeat. But it was the players, not
Sampson, who came out tentative against Germany and who hit the
post repeatedly without scoring against Iran. As much criticism as
he deserved, the players largely failed to take responsibility for
their own ineptitude.

<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. _ Liza Lou takes off her shoes and steps
gingerly into her neat back yard, careful not to disturb the
exuberant flowers. It has all the trappings of almost any other
well-tended patch of suburbia, with its meticulously groomed lawn,
its barbecue grill stoked with coals and its picnic table groaning
with food.
</P>
<P>
   But what makes this life-size yard unique is that the lawn
itself, along with everything on it, is formed by millions of tiny
glass beads.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Ms. Lou grabs the salad bowl off the table and
offers up a glimmering carrot (covered in orange beads, of course).
There are 80 items in the salad bowl alone, from jeweled garden
mushrooms to sparkling ruby-red tomatoes. Fat sandwiches, corn on
the cob and Bud beers, all beaded. The Sunday afternoon fare is, in
fact, like a shimmering hallucination of the suburban dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back Yard,'' which is on display through July 5 at the Santa
Monica Museum of Art, is the latest beaded project created by Ms.
Lou, 29, a Los Angeles artist who has been working with bugle beads
for about a decade. Her first installation was a beaded kitchen
that drew attention for its quirkiness, its love of detail and its
feminist critique of suburban life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back Yard,'' a companion piece, is a look at the more public
side of suburbia. It is, the artist says, ``a sugar-coated dream
turned toxic.''
</P>
<P>
   The new piece was partly financed by the Santa Monica Museum of
Art for its opening exhibition at its new location in the Bergamot
Station Art Center, a complex of art galleries on a former
industrial site. The museum's executive director, Thomas Rhoads,
became interested in Ms. Lou's work after seeing a bead-covered
vanity she made a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``What amazed me about Liza is the merging of both fine art and
craft,'' he said. ``Her work is accessible to the kinds of
individuals who would go to the state fair to see craft projects,
and yet it has a real conceptual grounding in feminist art. It's
the bringing together of these two worlds that makes it so
appealing and successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The beads are normally used to decorate clothing, and Ms. Lou
describes her work as ``three-dimensional paint'' with the ability
to create ``an explosion of color and light.'' But when she started
as an artist, many people disparaged her choice of materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look like art to anyone,'' she recalled. ``I had
artist friends asking me, `How's the life of a jeweler?' People
made the most unbelievable comments. It was horrible, but it also
encouraged me in a lot of ways, because I thought it must be
something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Although other contemporary artists have incorporated beads into
their work, only a few have used them on such a large scale. ``Back
Yard,'' which covers 528 square feet, required two years of work.
The installation is landscaped with 250,000 blades of bead grass in
varying shades of green and yellow. Hundreds of volunteers
fashioned the grass out of wire and beads, at what they called
weekend lawn parties.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lou constructed many of the objects, like the picnic table
and the leaves of the tree, out of old newspapers, and then glued
on beads and even sequins. ``The work takes so long that you don't
have a sense of achievement or accomplishment on a daily basis; you
feel like a failure every day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lou has been accused of being obsessive or even a bit loopy,
because she works so intensively with small materials. But she
disagrees with these labels. ``The practice of sitting and doing
your work every day is the opposite of obsession _ it's more like
devotion or a prayer,'' she said. ``The fact that it takes a long
time is just unfortunate. It's the price that one has to pay. When
you try to do something like this, you realize that you're going
against the grain of culture.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Lou attended the San Francisco Art Institute, but dropped
out to pursue her own projects, in part because of the criticism
she received over her use of beads. ``When people hated my work, I
wanted to do it bigger,'' she said. ``I left in order to develop
and grow.'' Cheryl Haines, who represents Ms. Lou out of the Haines
Gallery in San Francisco, describes her as a real contrarian.
</P>
<P>
   But having seen the grand mosaics and cathedrals of Italy, Ms.
Lou said, she wanted to create a work that was large, resplendent
and labor-intensive. One day she had a brainstorm in her mother's
kitchen: Why not bead the entire room?
</P>
<P>
   ``Kitchen,'' her first major piece, took five years to complete,
and it is also on display at the Santa Monica Museum, as a tribute
to the unacknowledged housewife.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fully beaded environment, complete with stove,
refrigerator, sink, cabinets and a table set with a bountiful
breakfast, all done in psychedelic patterns and colors. On a side
of the stove, a beaded poem by Emily Dickinson reads, ``She rose to
his Requirement, dropped/ The playthings of her life/ To take the
honorable work/ Of Woman and of Wife.''
</P>
<P>
   In between ``Back Yard'' and ``Kitchen,'' Ms. Lou completed
``Portrait Gallery,'' a series depicting all the American
presidents. She painted the portraits and then beaded them in
black, white and shades of gray, making them resemble old
photographs. ``Portrait Gallery'' is on display at the Aspen Art
Museum in Colorado through Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lou is now completing her first major commissioned work for

   TECHNOBUDDY30 _ Once upon a time, folks sat open-mouthed at
their first sight of a television set. When radio was first

understand human speech and translate more languages than a platoon

   CONSUMER-WATCH30 _ The federal Cooling-Off Rule, passed by
Congress in 1972 to protect vulnerable consumers from unscrupulous
door-to-door salespeople, is one of the nation's best consumer
laws. But it still remains one of the most misunderstood, which
often causes problems. Rarely a week passes that we don't receive
calls from readers who say they have purchased some item, usually a
car, and they want to return it. ``Don't I have three days to
change my mind?'' they ask. Usually the answer is no _ and nearly
always no with the purchase of a car, unless the seller agreed to a
return period. (Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   THARPE-COLUMN30 _ Fraudulent credit card offers are the kudzu
vine of consumer cons. They keep coming back, despite constant
efforts to eradicate them. Kudzu will thrive almost anywhere where
there's a little bit of dirt. Fraudulent cards thrive on the need
for credit _ and consumers who have difficulty obtaining credit are
prime targets for the bogus offers. (Tharpe, Atlanta

<P>
   TECHREPORT30 _ Dueling formats _ you know the story.
</P>
<P>
   It could be VHS against Betamax. Or compact discs against vinyl.
Fax vs. e-mail, vs. the Postal Service. Among wireless phones, it
could be traditional cellular against personal communications
services, or analog against digital. In connecting to the Internet,
there is a coming battle between phone lines called Asymmetric
Digital Subscriber Lines, known as ADSL, and cable modems running
over cable lines. And for them to succeed, they must both overcome
the slower but more entrenched modems. The formats clash. Sometimes
one dies, and sometimes they coexist. (Kanell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED.

RUBIN BACKS IMF AHEAD OF TALKS WITH THAI LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ After a whirlwind visit to Malaysia, in
which he defended the International Monetary Fund's harsh
prescriptions for healing Asia's economies, U.S. Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin arrived Monday evening in the place where the
financial contagion first began.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin will meet Tuesday with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai of
Thailand and other officials to discuss their efforts to climb out
of a recession _ nearly one year to the day since Bangkok floated
its currency, prompting a devastating devaluation from which it has
yet to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin's tour of Asia comes as the IMF is under growing attack
from politicians and business people here, who say the fund's
formula of high interest rates, rigorous fiscal policy and stable
currencies is strangling the region's economies and worsening the
pain of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday, Rubin offered a measured endorsement of the policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, on balance, the IMF has had it about right,'' he said
at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur after meeting with Malaysian
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. ``I think if you loosen interest
rates, it runs the risk of eroding the currency.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said he had a ``very good discussion'' with Mahathir,
though he would not divulge details. Mahathir has been a
vituperative critic of the West, blaming the crisis on currency
traders and accusing the U.S. government of attempting to profit
from the economic misery.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear that Rubin and Mahathir had a meeting of the
minds. On the question of whether the United States should
intervene in the market to support Malaysia's currency _ a measure
Mahathir has called for but which the United States has rebuffed _
Rubin said, ``The views of the prime minister are well known. And I
think our views are well known.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rubin's aides said the tone of the meeting was
constructive and that Mahathir did not make any inflammatory
remarks, which he has been known to do in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Rubin met with Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim, who made waves recently by publicly disagreeing with
Mahathir about whether Malaysia should lower its interest rates to
jump-start its economy. Mahathir said they should be lowered, while
Anwar favored keeping them high enough to maintain the stability of
Malaysia's currency, the ringgit.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a meeting Monday with Rubin, Anwar sounded more like
his boss _ declaring that interest rates were ``prohibitively
high'' and that the financial crisis was putting a severe strain on
Malaysian society.
</P>
<P>
   The pain of the Asian crisis has reached even Malaysia's
prosperous neighbor, Singapore, which announced a $1.2 billion
package of measures Monday to stimulate its sluggish economy.
Acknowledging that its economy will grow far more slowly in 1998
than it had forecasted, the Singaporean government said it would
increase public spending and offer tax rebates to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The social and political cost of the Asian crisis has been a
recurring theme of Rubin's tour, which began in China on Friday and
concludes Wednesday in South Korea. In a meeting with American
business executives in Kuala Lumpur, several people warned Rubin
about Indonesia, which they said could easily slide into disarray
in the wake of President Suharto's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a discomfort in Indonesia that the U.S. and
the West aren't taking Indonesia seriously,'' said Peter Woicke,
the managing director and chief executive of J.P. Morgan's Asia
Pacific division.
</P>
<P>
   Although the economic crisis precipitated a change in
governments here, Thailand has so far avoided the kind of social
unrest that hit Indonesia or the political dissension that has
afflicted Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the United States has praised the Chuan government for
faithfully carrying out the IMF plan, which it says has helped
Thailand regain the confidence of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   By most yardsticks, though, Thailand's economy is in parlous
shape. Exports are falling, unemployment is soaring and economists
say the country's output could shrink by 5.5 percent this year.
After a binge of borrowing from foreign banks during the Asian
economic boom, Thailand's bad debts may total as much as $25
billion _ a figure equal to 20 percent of its gross domestic
product.
</P>
<P>
   Even Bangkok's notorious traffic jams have subsided _ a
barometer, say residents here, of how much the city's commercial
life has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   Business executives here say the public's patience with
IMF-style solutions is wearing thin.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is deteriorating, with no end in sight,'' said
James Stent, the senior executive vice president of the Bank of
Asia, Thailand's 11th-largest bank. ``It's time for emergency
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lipton, the U.S. undersecretary of the treasury for
international affairs, said the IMF had made ``sensible''
adjustments to take account of Thailand's worsening condition _
allowing it, for example, to run a budget deficit instead of a
surplus. He said Rubin would urge the government to continue to
reform its banks, to strengthen its bankruptcy laws and to allow
more foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   But Stent said that as the crisis has dragged on, some people
here are coming to believe that Thailand's political and financial
institutions are not strong enough to tolerate the pressures of
being fully open.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's increasing skepticism that opening up to foreign
investment is a panacea,'' he said. &QL;

Meanwhile, a generation of daughters and granddaughters can take
the opportunity to check out ``GWTW'' on the World Wide Web and
maybe teach mom and grandma a little bit about cybersurfing at the
same time. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED.

   TECHNOBUDDY30 _ Once upon a time, folks sat open-mouthed at
their first sight of a television set. When radio was first
invented, some people seriously thought it might be the work of
devils. And nowadays we have computers that can read handwriting,
understand human speech and translate more languages than a platoon
of U.N. translators. So _ compared to all that _ I have my work cut
out for me when I tell you that the most magical technological
device that I know is an antenna. (Husted, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED.

   TECHTOOLS30 _ This column is dedicated to the literati among you
who run computers despite an innate loathing of them; consider it
your reward for reading this column even when it bewilders you. And
now ... Computer Haiku. (Warner, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f,

</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER-WATCH30 _ The federal Cooling-Off Rule, passed by
Congress in 1972 to protect vulnerable consumers from unscrupulous
door-to-door salespeople, is one of the nation's best consumer
laws. But it still remains one of the most misunderstood, which
often causes problems. Rarely a week passes that we don't receive
calls from readers who say they have purchased some item, usually a
car, and they want to return it. ``Don't I have three days to
change my mind?'' they ask. Usually the answer is no _ and nearly
always no with the purchase of a car, unless the seller agreed to a
return period. (Tharpe, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   THARPE-COLUMN30 _ Fraudulent credit card offers are the kudzu
vine of consumer cons. They keep coming back, despite constant
efforts to eradicate them. Kudzu will thrive almost anywhere where
there's a little bit of dirt. Fraudulent cards thrive on the need
for credit _ and consumers who have difficulty obtaining credit are
prime targets for the bogus offers. (Tharpe, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TECHREPORT30 _ Dueling formats _ you know the story.
</P>
<P>
   It could be VHS against Betamax. Or compact discs against vinyl.
Fax vs. e-mail, vs. the Postal Service. Among wireless phones, it
could be traditional cellular against personal communications
services, or analog against digital. In connecting to the Internet,
there is a coming battle between phone lines called Asymmetric
Digital Subscriber Lines, known as ADSL, and cable modems running
over cable lines. And for them to succeed, they must both overcome
the slower but more entrenched modems. The formats clash. Sometimes
one dies, and sometimes they coexist. (Kanell, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) (f, l) MOVED.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ He is clearly a man on a mission: so much so that it is
easy to forget that Daniel Passarella already has won two World
Cups for Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   But the first came at home in 1978, when Gen. Jorge Rafael
Videla, head of the military junta that was responsible for the
disappearances and deaths of tens of thousands of Passarella's
countrymen, triumphantly handed him the trophy. ''If I'd known then
what was happening, I wouldn't have played at all,'' Passarella,
the captain of that team, has said.
</P>
<P>
   The second came in 1986, when he was on the Argentine roster,
but because of an illness, only got to watch from the bench as his
teammate Diego Maradona worked wonders with his feet and, in one
infamous instance against England, with his fist.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps that helps explain why Passarella, now national
technical director and coach, has erected an eight-foot fence
around Argentina's French training base in L'Etrat and decided to
keep distractions, including interviews, to a minimum. This
Argentine team, in every sense his team, has a chance to give him a
title without an asterisk.
</P>
<P>
   First it must get past England in the second round on Tuesday in
what is viewed as a grudge match by the English, who will never
forget nor entirely forgive Argentina for Maradona's handball that
became a goal in the 1986 quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sleep for four days afterward,'' said England coach
Glenn Hoddle, who, unlike Passarella, played in that match.
</P>
<P>
   Passarella has been less forthcoming with his reminiscences, but
his team, a foreboding mix of polished veterans and gifted
youngsters, is clearly the favorite against England. It has not
given up a goal in its last eight matches, and with midfielder Juan
Veron who excels at organizing, midfielder Ariel Ortega who excels
at creating and striker Gabriel Batistuta who excels at scoring,
its strengths are hardly on the back line alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gathering strength,'' Passarella said after his team
defeated Croatia to win Group H.
</P>
<P>
   Only two other men have won World Cups as players and coaches:
Mario Zagallo of Brazil, and Franz Beckenbauer of Germany, but
Passarella already shares a continent with Zagallo and a nickname
with Beckenbauer. At home, the stocky, stylishly dressed Passarella
is known as ``El Kaiser,'' and at 45, he is as focused and
unflinching a coach as he was a central defender in a fine career
that took him from Argentine club River Plate to the Italian first
division. He was a high-scoring defender, in part because he often
took penalty kicks, but he is best remembered for his intensity,
and it is telling that he received a red card in the club match
that was intended to honor his career.
</P>
<P>
   Passarella has experienced personal tragedy: the death of his
18-year-old son, Sebastian, in an automobile accident. He has had
to live with regrets: the 1978 World Cup and the junta it helped
legitimize. But if he adopted a hard line with Argentina, it is
also because of timing. When he took over the national team in
1994, it had just been through a convulsive, divisive experience at
the World Cup in which it had started brilliantly and then
self-destructed after Maradona tested positive for epehedrine and
suspended from the tournament. Passarella, who already had coached
River Plate to three Argentine titles, took over with the intention
of emphasizing rigor and professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Practices became more structured and players were required to
undergo nasal examinations to ensure that none was using cocaine.
But what would become the biggest conversation piece at home and
abroad was Passarella's decision to ban long hair. His public
explanation was that long hair was a distraction during matches,
but for Batistuta, one of those who trimmed his locks, that was not
Passarella's only reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cut mine because there was a project to to change the image
of the Argentinian player,'' he said. ``It was a question of
helping out Passarella.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone acquiesced. Fernando Redondo, one of the world's
finest defensive midfielders, refused to cut his hair for the
cause, and though Passarella has since ended the ban, he and
Redondo have yet to reconcile. Passarella has said part of the
problem is that Redondo did not want to play a different position
on the national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I select a player who thinks he's doing the team a favor by
joining us, then I not only irritate myself but my players, as
well,'' Passarella said.
</P>
<P>
   Passarella did irritate Batistuta, Argentina's all-time leading
scorer with 46 goals, by leaving him off the team for much of 1997
and choosing to rely on Hernan Crespo and other young players he
had coached at River Plate and at the Olympics in 1996, where
Argentina won the silver medal. Passarella also had coached
Batistuta at River Plate in 1989, and had benched him then, too.
This time, he explained that integrating Batistuta properly into
the national team required more than the few days allotted by FIFA
for teams to prepare for World Cup qualifying matches.
</P>
<P>
   Dropping Batistuta ignited a thousand arguments in the streets
and cafes of Argentina, but there was no arguing with the results.
With its star striker, Argentina had only 10 points in seven
matches and was in third place in the South American qualifying
race. Without him, it would go on to defeat Colombia in Colombia
and finish first. But Passarella did not leave Batistuta off his
World Cup team, and ``Batigol'' has responded with four goals in
three games in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has worked very hard, and he deserves his success,''
Passarella said. ''I hope he finishes leading scorer, but I know
that his first desire is that the team go as far as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``El Kaiser,'' as it turns out, can also be kind, but however
far his fine team goes, he does not plan on trying again in 2002.
The day after Argentina's last match in France, he will resign.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Strong thunderstorms will erupt across sections of the East on
Tuesday as a potent jet-stream disturbance rotates through the
region. During the morning, one cluster of showers and
thunderstorms will move through New York and eastern Pennsylvania,
affecting New England by afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the jet-stream disturbance intercepts a fast flow of sultry
air from the southwest, an area of showers and strong thunderstorms
will form in portions of the Ohio Valley on Tuesday morning. These
storms will advance east to the Middle Atlantic States by
afternoon. A few of the storms will produce hail and flooding
rains, though the fast movement of the storms will preclude
widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, winds changing direction and increasing with
altitude will cause a few of these storms to rotate. These rotating
storms, known as supercells, are capable of producing tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Uncomfortably hot and humid air will cover the southern Plains
and Southeast. As the sun heats the sultry air, rising currents of
moistened air will produce scattered afternoon cumulus clouds, a
few of which will yield to afternoon thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   An expansive high-pressure system at 20,000 feet will bring
sunny skies and blistering heat to the valleys of the interior
Southwest and eastern New Mexico. Farther northeast, isolated
afternoon thunderstorms will develop near a front over western
Kansas and eastern Colorado. Elsewhere, the West Coast will be
mainly sunny and seasonably warm, though patchy morning clouds will
cling to the coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Warmth Returns
</P>
<P>
   The mercury hit 80 degrees at Elko, Nev., on Sunday for the
first time since October 4, 1997. The streak of 266 days with
temperatures below 80 degrees broke the previous record of 255
consecutive days set in 1970-1971. Sunday's milestone also marked
the latest date for 80 degrees to be observed at Elko, surpassing
the previous latest date of June 16, 1971. The lack of heat in the
Far West has resulted, in part, from the absence of warm
high-pressure systems over the region, allowing cloudy low-pressure
systems from the Pacific to regularly tamp down daytime
temperatures.

U.S. TEAM IN FRANCE: `LES MISERABLES' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JILL R. DORSON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Eric Wynalda sat in the shadows beneath the
bleachers at Spartan Stadium Saturday night, sporting a freshly
buzzed head and showing a tremendous amount of restraint.
</P>
<P>
   After much prodding, Wynalda finally said what anyone who
followed the U.S. national team during the World Cup already knew:
``It was just miserable. The whole World Cup experience was
miserable. We just felt so helpless.''
</P>
<P>
   So Wynalda did the only thing he knew to do _ he hightailed it
back from France in time to start for the Clash (5-11) against Los
Angeles (14-2).
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda had an assist to Richard Gough in the 15th minute but
the Clash lost, 2-1, thanks to Galaxy goals by Paul Caligiuri in
the 64th minute and Harut Karapetyan in the 85th minute. The
outcome extended San Jose's losing streak to five games and Los
Angeles' winning streak to four.
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda, who along with New England's Joe-Max Moore and Mike
Burns were the first national team players to play in MLS games
since the U.S. team was eliminated Thursday, came back for two
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, he said, ``the World Cup effort is over,'' and second,
``I wasn't playing that much anyway. I wanted to play in France and
I wasn't given that opportunity and I want to play now. ... I've
got a lot to prove to this club and to myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken a lot from this club with regards to the national
team ... that I was more involved with the national team than with
this club and that I saved myself for national team games and that
wasn't fair to me. ... I think this is my way of proving that my
heart was always here because it has been.''
</P>
<P>
   At best, Wynalda's World Cup experience was disappointing. At
worst, it did nothing to showcase his skills at the international
level. In his third World Cup appearance, Wynalda started against
Germany, was benched against Iran and entered the Yugoslavia game
as a substitute in the second half. In all, he played less than 90
minutes and barely got a touch on the ball during the two weeks.
But the experience led him to at least one decision about the
future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made my mind up after the Iran game that I am going to go
for my fourth (World Cup) because there is no way I'm going to let
my WC career end like that,'' Wynalda said.
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda was slow to point a finger at national team coach Steve
Sampson. Wynalda did say that Sampson's lack of experience in the
international arena was apparent and that any relationship that
Wynalda had with Sampson is virtually over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve and I used to have a very good relationship and we used
to talk but somewhere along the line, there just wasn't a dialogue
anymore,'' Wynalda said. ``Since (Sampson cut captain) John Harkes,
I think that he made up the mind that he wanted to sever the cord
there. The people who were most honest with him got hurt the
most.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynalda's quick return to the Clash was greeted with enthusiasm
by the organization and 22,694 fans, who offered a standing
ovation. But, as has been rumored, Wynalda's time in San Jose may
be short. Wynalda's contract runs out at the end of this season and
he has a one-year option.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rumors were true, I did have an opportunity to go back to
Europe but I can't be specific because then you get in trouble,''
Wynalda said. ``My contract ends this year and it has an option. If
MLS can convince me, I'll stay. But either way, by the time I'm 30,
I'll be free.''

FATE OF `PEONY' MAY HANG ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ With barely a week to go before the scheduled
opening of ``The Peony Pavilion'' in New York City, Lincoln Center
Festival director Nigel Redden said Monday there was still a slim
chance that intervention by President Clinton would persuade
Chinese authorities to allow the opera's actors to fly to New York
in time for opening night, July 7.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
arrived in Shanghai on Monday night after three days in Beijing
that were characterized by remarkably open public discussion of
issues like freedom and human rights. Redden said he was planning a
news conference on Tuesday to urge the president to extend that
spirit of openness to artistic freedom while he was in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the time when President Clinton, or Secretary of State
Albright, should speak out,'' Redden said. ``My hope is that
somehow the timing of his visit will help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Redden flew here a week ago, after Shanghai's Bureau of Culture
suddenly blocked shipment of the elaborate sets, costumes and props
for the classic Chinese opera, raising objections to the innovative
staging of the production and calling it too feudal, superstitious
and pornographic.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of getting nowhere in negotiations, and a
confrontation with Shanghai officials at Shanghai's Hongqiao
International Airport, Redden left for Hong Kong. But he came back
the next day after the authorities agreed to allow the sets,
costumes and props _ all paid for and technically owned by Lincoln
Center and its co-producers _ to be shipped.
</P>
<P>
   The shipment left Shanghai on Sunday and arrived safely in New
York, Redden said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the actors of ``The Peony Pavilion,'' members of the Kunqu
Opera Company who had never before performed this refined
16th-century opera in its full, 55-act form, have not been given
clearance to go to New York.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the actors were taken by the authorities to a country
guest house outside Shanghai to rehearse a revised script of the
opera, Redden said, apparently to keep them far from the White
House press corps, which descended on Shanghai Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Two censors were there monitoring the rehearsal, Redden said, as
well as a new director, replacing Chen Shi-Zheng, who was born in
China and moved to the United States in 1987. He was hired by
Lincoln Center to direct a groundbreaking new version of the opera.
</P>
<P>
   Redden said he and Chen attended rehearsals on Sunday and Monday
and were surprised to find that the revisions seemed minor, in some
cases virtually inconsequential. Yet an official from the Bureau of
Culture told Redden that more discussions were needed and that
there was no guarantee that the actors would be allowed to leave
Shanghai this week in any case.
</P>
<P>
   Redden has said from the beginning of his negotiations that
Lincoln Center would be prepared to accept minor changes but not
anything that would alter the artistic integrity of Chen's
production or that did not have Chen's approval.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's version of the opera, a novel interpretation that takes
more than 20 hours to perform, met great response and received a
rave review in People's Daily, the Communist Party's principal
newspaper, when a dress rehearsal was performed here this month.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it brought objections from Ma Bomin, director of Shanghai's
Bureau of Culture, who called ``The Peony Pavilion'' a national
treasure that needed protection from unorthodox interpretations.
She also seemed angered when Chen refused to accept all of the
officials' suggested changes, as directors in China are usually
required to do.
</P>
<P>
   With Shanghai officials convening one long closed-door meeting
after another to discuss the opera over the last week, it appears
that ``The Peony Pavilion'' became a major political issue within
the local government, particularly with the timing of Clinton's
arrival. The nature and details of that internal debate have
remained secret.
</P>
<P>
   Redden, admittedly a neophyte in Chinese politics, said he
remained mystified by the way the opera's fate seemed to be tied up
in local political concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects so well on Chinese culture,'' said Redden,
referring to the production. ``I just don't understand why they
don't want to let it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Summing up, he said he was not optimistic: ``It's a game of
chicken, and I'm not sure we're going to win.''

`EXPLAINING HITLER': DANGEROUS TO UNDERSTAND, DANGEROUS TO IGNORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(th) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you thought the one historical figure people could reach a
consensus on was Adolf Hitler, you'd be very wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Given the growing relativization of history writing and the
constant intramural infighting in academia, given the growing
preference of scholars for seeing history as a product of abstract
social forces rather than the acts of individual men, historians
have left us not with one Hitler, but a multitude of Hitlers.
</P>
<P>
   There's the demonic Hitler, the very embodiment of
unaccommodated evil and irrational hatred, of course. But as the
journalist Ron Rosenbaum points out in his fascinating new book
``Explaining Hitler,'' there is also the small-time con man Hitler,
the statesman-like Hitler, the gemuetlich Hitler, and the
dithering, Hamlet-like Hitler, who had a hard time making up his
mind whether or not to exterminate the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The historian Hugh Trevor-Roper gave us an irrational but
sincere Hitler, ``convinced of his own rectitude,'' while the
Hitler biographer Alan Bullock gave us a calculating, coldblooded
Hitler who came to believe his own Machiavellian act.
</P>
<P>
   While Daniel Goldhagen, the author of the best-selling book
``Hitler's Willing Executioners,'' suggests that Hitler was little
more than a midwife to the war against the Jews, the writer Milton
Himmelfarb takes the position of ``No Hitler, no Holocaust.''
</P>
<P>
   What all these different Hitlers represent are different ways of
looking at evil, at free will, at personal responsibility and at
the workings of history, and in ``Explaining Hitler,'' Rosenbaum
not only re-examines a myriad of scholarly writings on the Nazi
leader, but also attempts to explicate the explanations.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, he shows how historians, philosophers and
psychologists have projected their own agendas, preconceptions and
yearnings for certainty onto their portraits of Hitler, and how
their portraits in turn mirror broader cultural assumptions.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many intellectual histories, ``Explaining Hitler'' does
not confine itself to simple textual analysis, but showcases
Rosenbaum's reportorial skills with acute, sometimes edgy
interviews with such controversial thinkers as Claude Lanzmann, the
creator of the movie ``Shoah''; George Steiner, the critic and
author of the much debated novel ``The Portage to San Cristobal of
A.H.,'' and the Hitler apologist David Irving.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting book, portions of which originally appeared in The
New Yorker, is a lively, provocative work of cultural history that
is as compelling as it is thoughtful, as readable as it is smart.
</P>
<P>
   As Rosenbaum observes in this volume, ``powerful tendencies in
contemporary scholarship have cumulatively served to diminish the
decisiveness and centrality of Hitler's role.''
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, many scholars have argued that larger, more
profound forces of history and society are to blame for the
Holocaust. Goldhagen suggests that by the time Hitler came to power
in 1933, racial anti-Semitism had already made Germany ``pregnant
with murder''; the scholar Hyam Maccoby contends that Christianity
(with its pernicious anti-Semitic stereotypes) had by World War II
created a craving for vengeance against Jews; and Richard Breitman,
editor of ``Holocaust and Genocide Studies,'' argues that the
traumas sustained by Germany in the early years of the century (a
humiliating defeat in World War I, then starvation, inflation and a
crushing depression) forged a desperation and rage that Hitler was
able to channel against the Jews.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, hard-core Freudians and psycho-historians
intent on trying to map Hitler's psyche have come up with an
assortment of explanations that effectively let Hitler off the
hook, using what Rosenbaum calls ``the Menendez defense'' to depict
him, astonishingly enough, as a victim.
</P>
<P>
   The famous psychoanalyst Alice Miller portrays Hitler as a
victim of an abusive father; Erich Fromm, as the victim of an
overbearing mother. Other thinkers have attributed Hitler's
pathology to a ``primal-scene trauma,'' to a missing testicle, to a
sexual secret that ``isolated him from the normal love of human
beings,'' to a physical illness and to a self-hatred (stemming from
his suspicion that his grandmother had a Jewish lover and that he
himself was ``tainted'' by Jewish blood).
</P>
<P>
   Even more perversely, other scholars have tried to come up with
a single Jew as the true source of Hitler's metamorphosis from a
run-of-the-mill malcontent into an anti-Semitic monster.
</P>
<P>
   Their suspects include a Jewish prostitute who might have given
him syphilis (this is a theory advanced by the renowned Nazi hunter
Simon Wiesenthal), a Jewish music teacher or musician who might
have been involved with Hitler's beloved half-niece Geli Raubal
(who died of a gunshot wound under mysterious circumstances in
Hitler's apartment), and a Jewish doctor who may have bungled the
treatment of Hitler's mother, who died in 1907 of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
   What the more absurd of these theories make clear is how
dangerous the effort to explain Hitler can be _ how it can result
in a rationalization of his actions, exempting him from
responsibility for his crimes while shifting the blame to abstract
historical forces or subconscious psychic drives.
</P>
<P>
   It can also provide us with false consolation. Those theories
that suggest that Hitler was a madman completely off the charts of
human behavior allow us to shrug him off as a horrible anomaly,
while other theories, which suggest that he was not consciously
evil, enable us to ignore his darkest implications about human
nature.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rosenbaum argues, repudiating any effort to
understand Hitler or the Holocaust (as Lanzmann has done) can lead
to a process of mystification that effectively shields the
murderers from responsibility for their crimes and thwarts all
efforts to learn from the horrors of the past.
</P>
<P>
   In analyzing the consequences and implications of various
efforts to explain Hitler, Rosenbaum himself has made an important
contribution to our understanding not just of Hitler, but of the
cultural processes by which we try to come to terms with history as
well.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Explaining Hitler,'' he has written a book that does for
Hitler studies what David Lehman's superb book ``Signs of the
Times'' did for deconstruction: he has written an exciting, lucid
book informed by two qualities in increasingly short supply in
academic circles: old-fashioned moral rigor and plain old common
sense.

 &HT;    NAACP RATES HOTEL CHAINS TO FORCE CHANGES
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Conceding he aims to ``intimidate'' the lodging
industry into ``doing the right thing,'' NAACP President Kweisi
Mfume released the civil rights group's ratings of hotel chains on
Monday and urged travelers not to check in at those that scored
low.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the NAACP's ``economic reciprocity initiative,'' the
hotel chains were graded on their ``diversity and minority business
development'' in categories such as employment, vendor relations ,
equity and ownership in hotels, advertising, marketing and
philanthropy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hotels that receive a 'D' will not receive NAACP business
dollars,'' explained Mfume. ``And, we will take every opportunity
to inform consumers of our decision and urge them to make similar
choices.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas-based Omni Hotels chain received the lowest grade, a
'D-minus,' and Mfume said the NAACP has purposefully avoided the
Atlanta Omni in booking rooms and events for its annual convention
there next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, you often get what you can get when you can get
it'' because conventions must compete for space, he said. ``But we
were able to extract some punishment (by avoiding the Omni), if not
distribute some rewards'' by booking hotels that scored highest on
the NAACP report card.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the report, Omni Hotels released a statement
saying its 1997 report to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission showed that ``minorities, including African Americans,
represent a majority of the company's employees.'' Omni said 64
percent of its employees were minorities, including 25 percent
African-American, and 58 percent of its managers were minorities,
including 13 percent African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Omni said this represented an increase in the number of minority
managers, including African-Americans, over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   In the NAACP ratings, Omni did score ``excellent'' in minority
employment of division managers and clerical and administrative
workers on their hotel staffs. But Omni rated ``poor'' in the
percentage of properties owned by minorities and in doing business
with minority vendors. Omni also rated ``poor'' in the use of
minority-owned advertising firm, expenditures in minority-owned
media and marketing campaigns aimed at minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Bennett, the Omni Corporate Communications Director,
said the firm's rating was at least partly because it is a private
firm and didn't answer many of the NAACP questions, deeming the
information ``proprietary.'' Its employment statistics came only
from the firm's 25 owned and managed hotels and not its 17
franchised operations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mfume said the hotel industry must realize that
minority workers ``can do something other than carry bags, make
beds and wash dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP gave its top grade, a ``B,'' to Cendant, a chain that
includes Days Inn, Howard Johnson, Travel Lodge and Super 8 Motels.
Next came a B-minus for Promus, with properties including
Doubletree, Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn and Guest Suites and
Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a ``D'' the previous year, Memphis-based Promus
said it formed a ``diversity committee'' and tried to bring
African-American companies into its advertising, community
relations and vendor support programs.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott, Westin and Choice, which includes Comfort Inns and
EconoLodges, all received ``C-pluses.'' Holiday Hospitality,
Wyndham, Hilton, and Radisson got ``C's.'' Hyatt and ITT Sheraton
got ``C-minuses.'' Best Western got a ``D-plus'' and Adam's Mark
got a ``D.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions at a press conference, Mfume said the
ratings are ``designed to intimidate'' hotel chains into being fair
to the minorities who he said spend over $5 billion a year in
travel and tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe, quite frankly, that our corporate friends ought to
be rewarded with our business,'' he said. ``We are looking for
evidence that companies are taking steps to create opportunities
for African Americans and other people of color.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is based on industry responses to an NAACP survey.
</P>
<P>
   Holiday Hospitality, based in Atlanta, is a subsidiary of Bass
Hotels and Resorts, and includes Holiday Inns. Responding to the
survey, the company said, ``Bass Hotels and Resorts will continue
efforts to address diversity across its hotel system and corporate
offices, including bringing more diversity to senior managment
ranks, sales and customer service teams.''

 SOSA, GRIFFEY HOMER HAPPILY IN McGWIRE'S SHADOW  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN SHEA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mark McGwire might feel like a caged animal, but
Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr. feel as free as birds. That's
because McGwire is doing all the dirty work, drawing unprecedented
attention to his awesome batting-practice displays, majestic home
runs and legitimate pursuit of Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and Griffey are simply waiting in the wings, silently but
effectively keeping within striking distance of Maris without the
pressure and headaches that seem to plague McGwire, even though he
plays in a tiny media market.
</P>
<P>
   In any other season, Sosa and Griffey would be smothered in
national publicity and daily updates on The Chase. But this year is
different because McGwire is so far ahead of Maris' 1961 pace that
anything fewer than 62 home runs would now be a letdown.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire entered the weekend, which signaled the halfway point of
the season, with 35 home runs. A 70-homer pace. Sosa, thanks to his
monster June _ a record 19 blasts so far _ checked in with 32
homers, a 64-homer pace. And Griffey had 30, on pace for 60.
</P>
<P>
   For the sake of comparison, Griffey also had 30 homers at the
midway point last year, but he was getting gobs of attention
because his Mariners were leading the American League West and
McGwire, who was going nose-to-nose with Griffey, was a member of
the last-place A's.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, McGwire has become an event, and others are sitting
comfortably in the back seat willing to wait until September to hop
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth,'' Sosa said, ``I'm not thinking about
it. I'm not Mark McGwire. Mark McGwire is the man. I'm just trying
to do my job and help the team. Maybe I'll think about it at the
end of the year, but not right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey usually refuses to address any questions relating to
Maris, simplifying things with his standard line: ``I'm not a
home-run hitter.'' It may be true, because Griffey can do so many
other things. But a guy like McGwire would never get away with such
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In the days Griffey was talking about the record, he said,
``It's surprising it's lasted that long with (Jose) Canseco,
McGwire, Cecil (Fielder), Al  &LR; (Belle) and Frank (Thomas) around.
Hey, I'm the little guy in that group. Maybe that's why I don't
have a statue at home with 62 on it.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems as though Griffey's father walked out on the Reds last
week because of problems that date back to 1975. Ken Griffey Sr.,
who doesn't forget much, is still miffed that Sparky Anderson
pulled him for a pinch hitter two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was treated with no respect in 1975 when he pinch-hit for me
in the eighth inning of a game with the bases loaded and no outs
when I was hitting .300,'' Griffey said. ``And nobody knows the
full story of 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Griffey said he was asked by then manager Lou Piniella
and GM Bob Quinn to fake an injury so the Reds could replace him
with Bill Doran. Griffey refused and was placed on the involuntary
retired list. He later signed with Seattle to play with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey also chided the current manager, Jack McKeon, by saying,
``I'm out of the loop because I don't drink whiskey, smoke cigars
and listen to old stories.''

   &UR; South Africa Garden Route &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. During a tour of South Africa in October, my husband and I
would like to visit the Garden Route for three days. Can you
recommend agencies that start from George and list the highlights?
_ Ethel Rosenthal, Bayonne, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Stretching for about 125 miles, the Garden Route, where trees
rise like cathedral columns in some places, includes such
highlights as Oudtshoorn, the home of ostrich farms; the Little
Karoo, a semiarid region adjoining lush areas; the lagoons at
Plettenberg Bay and Knysna; the Cango Caves; a steam train ride of
about two hours from George to Knysna, and Tsitsikamma National
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Tours of the route run three or four days and cover many of the
highlights cited. They usually go from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth,
or vice versa, or start and end in Cape Town. Vehicles you would
take range from a minivan for 7 to a bus seating 18 or more.
</P>
<P>
   If you're committed to starting in George and prefer not to
drive _ having to drive on the left may be enough cause for

   &UR; The Concorde on the Cheap &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I would like to experience flying on the Concorde but can't
afford to spend thousands of dollars. What is the least expensive
Concorde trip one can take? _ Fred Bernstein, New York, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. So that you get the big picture, it seems worth mentioning
that a regularly scheduled round trip flight costs $10,384 between
New York and Paris on Air France and $9,165 between New York and
London on British Airways. On Air France, the fare to Paris to
$9,346 if a ticket is bought four days ahead. Between July 1 and
Aug. 31, members of the Air France frequent flier club can take a
companion along at half price, which comes to $7009.50 apiece. If
the fares seem steep, bear in mind that the flight time to Paris,
gate to gate, is a 3 hours and 40 minutes _ and a half-hour less to
London _ since you're traveling as fast as 1,340 miles an hour, or
twice the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   For a taste of the Concorde, an hour-and-40-minute flight
operates about twice a month from Heathrow Airport outside London.
The cost is $1,125 and, in December, $1,141 (at 60 pence to the
dollar). The flight takes you out over the Atlantic and includes a
champagne breakfast and a visit to the flight deck. It is organized
by Goodwood Travel, St. Andrew's House, Station Road East,
Canterbury, Kent CT1 2WD; telephone (44-1227) 763336, fax (44-1227)
762417.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, you can take a one-hour flight on Aug. 1 or 2
aboard a British Airways Concorde at the Experimental Aircraft
Association's annual meeting in Oshkosh, Wis. Flights will operate
twice a day and cost $715. Note, however, that because of Federal
Aviation Administration regulations flights may not exceed the
speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   A bargain is to be had on Aug. 3 when a British Airways Concorde
returns to Europe from Wisconsin. The fare is $2,222 from Oshkosh
to Heathrow via Kennedy Airport or $1,925 from Kennedy to Heathrow.
Information: Travel Service Corporation, (800) 634-2153 or (312)
726-3290, fax (312) 726-1189. While gloating about the saving,
don't forget about the cost of getting back: Subsonic one-way
flights start at $440.

   &UR; Van Goghs to Washington &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the fall the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam is scheduled to
be renovated. Part of the collection is to be on display in
Washington during the closing. How can I get tickets? _ Arlene
Copeland, Clifton Springs, N.Y.
</P>

</P>
<P>

expected to reopen in April.
</P>
<P>

   CLINTON-CHINA-MAIN _ BEIJING _ At the Beijing train station
Monday morning people were playing pool, tending fussy kids, buying
snacks. And a few dozen followed a very abnormal pursuit, listening
raptly to President Clinton talk about freedom and democracy. What
they and potentially half a billion other Chinese heard was
Clinton's unprecedented argument on behalf of freedoms never
enjoyed here and change that is seldon even whispered about today.
Some Chinese enthused. Many thought Clinton was meddling. But even
among those, thoughts lingered that some good might come of his

of the handover of Hong Kong _ a celebration he reportedly was

performed late in a woman's pregnancy when a fetus is partially
delivered and then aborted when only its head remains in the birth
canal. Opponents say the procedure, which they call ``partial-birth

END IN SIGHT FOR DEBACLE OF DAVIS LAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTOLA, Calif. _ The continuing saga of Davis Lake has turned
into a giant monkey that the California Department of Fish and Game
just hasn't been able to shake off its back.
</P>
<P>
   But the inside word is that the DFG will try to shed the nemesis
over the July 4 weekend, and the immediate weeks that follow.
That's when the DFG hopes to make the first in a series of trout
plants that will add up to more than 700,000 fish, including tons
of 5-to 15-pound trout, the biggest trout plants in the history of
the state.
</P>
<P>
   There's never been another story quite like this one anywhere in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Davis Lake, in the Sierra Nevada northwest of Reno, Nev., had
been one of the nation's most aquatic-rich mountain lakes. That is
why it produced a strain of wild rainbow trout that were huge by
mountain standards, with 16-to 24-inch trout quite typical, with
the brightest spots and the fightingest fight you've ever seen.
They added special sizzle for place always enticing to camp, see
wildlife and enjoy outdoor adventure.
</P>
<P>
   All that changed when two locals reportedly caught some pike at
Winnemucca Lake in Nevada, then illegally transported the fish into
Davis and plunked them in. The habitat was perfect for pike, and in
two years, they wiped out both year classes of young trout. From
the start, DFG biologists feared that the pike would slip
downstream and wipe out other fisheries, so they poisoned the lake
last fall, against intense protests by residents.
</P>
<P>
   You probably have heard the rest: Despite all kinds of promises
that everything would be fine, the poisoning was screwed up so
badly, with lax monitoring, overkill on poisons and lingering toxic
readings, that the State Water Resources Control Board made the
lake off limits to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Water Board fined the DFG the equivalent about $500,000
(in the form of trout plants at nearby Frenchman Lake and Grizzly
Creek), the Plumas County district attorney tried to arrest the DFG
people who were responsible for the foul-ups, and business owners
are lining up for lawsuits. If you took a vote in Plumas County
right now, I bet they'd vote 95 percent or higher to secede from
California.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the tests finally came in clean. The Department of
Health Services will have one last series of tests, then the DFG
plans to hold a public hearing in Portola to discuss hopes of
opening the lake for the July 4 weekend holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of fish planned to be stocked is staggering. 700,000?
In comparison, Lake Merced in San Francisco, which is within 20
miles of 3 million people, gets only 15,000 pounds of trout per
year from the DFG. In addition, the DFG will be buying many loads
of bigger fish from outside vendors, and provide fish from many
different year classes.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is the planted fish will quickly take on the
characteristics of the previous wild strains that made Davis so
popular among anglers.
</P>
<P>
   But the reality is that the true future of this once-great
fishery will be the progeny of those planted fish _ fish that will
be born wild and learn to fend for themselves.

BIKER BROTHERHOOD: THE SOFTER SIDE OF A MOTORCYCLE GANG 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Broadcast details appear at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(nk) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The home life of the ``Ching-a-Ling,'' a subspecies of the genus
``Biker Brotherhood,'' is inspected Tuesday night on a new series
unoriginally titled ``Inside Story'' and presided over by the
ubiquitous Bill Kurtis. Known to some as a motorcycle gang, the
Ching-a-Lings are here described as ``Road Warriors,'' dedicated,
they announce, to ``family, freedom, honor.'' The black-garbed,
ferociously decorated fellowship (they go in for Nazi symbols on
their jackets and tattoos everywhere) is tracked to its home lairs
and revealed to have a domestic side.
</P>
<P>
   The Ching-a-Lings are a mostly Hispanic group of perhaps 30
Bronx motorcycle enthusiasts: ``a religion, a brotherhood, a
family,'' Kurtis croons. There are intimations of a violent past
involving drugs, rape, even murder. These days heroin is strictly
forbidden, and members hint that persons who do not live up to
their present standards can count on retaliation. (``We ain't no
saints here,'' one confesses or boasts.) Details of what they mean
by ``taking care of business'' we are left to imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this hour, which can be enjoyed as a takeoff on pop
sociology (``the Ching-a-Ling culture is steeped heavily in the
past,'' says Kurtis), is given to the softer side of the tribe. One
female companion proclaims, ``I'm his property,'' and the men
report that their bikes attract too many girls to handle. Family
values receive their due. We travel with one biker (on foot) as he
escorts his little daughter around the neighborhood on Halloween
night; his hefty presence gives a certain imperative to trick or
treat.
</P>
<P>
   You can also see the comrades partying, posturing (``Win it all
or lose everything'' is their slogan), hanging out and making an
annual visit to the cemetery to pay homage to a fellow member
killed in a shootout. There are flowers and candles, and cocaine
fumes are blown and beer is spit reverently over the tomb of
another departed. ``The Ching-a-Lings have seen a need to evolve,''
Kurtis says unsmilingly, to pictures of them riding their machines
on behalf of Toys for Tots, but not on the sidewalk.

SECURITY COUNCIL DEBATES RAPID INCREASE IN CHILD SOLDIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ As a measure of how dramatically the face of
modern warfare has changed in the last decade, the Security Council
spent its day Monday debating the rapid increase in the number of
child soldiers worldwide and what, if anything, can be done to keep
children away from combat.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say as many as 300,000 children in at least 50 countries
are directly involved in conflict around the world _ as soldiers,
porters and frequently as all-purpose slaves _ in violation of
international treaties.
</P>
<P>
   Children are conscripted, cajoled or tricked into volunteering
and sometimes sold to armies and guerrilla groups by families
thrown into poverty by ethnic conflicts that now kill more
civilians than troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often children become soldiers just to survive,'' Italy's
representative at the United Nations, Paolo Fulci, told the
council, which opened the daylong session with an impassioned
speech from Secretary-General Kofi Annan's newly appointed special
representative on children and armed conflict, Olara A. Otunnu.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last decade alone, we have seen 2 million children
killed, over 1 million orphaned, 6 million seriously injured or
permanently disabled, 12 million made homeless and 10 million left
with serious psychological trauma,'' said Otunnu, a former Ugandan
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Lewis, deputy executive director of UNICEF, the U.N.
children's fund, said in an interview Monday that a booming trade
in small arms was contributing to a worldwide ``culture of violence
and indiscriminate killing at end of the 20th century'' that was
putting guns into the hands of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``One tries to fathom what is happening towards children,''
Lewis said. ``One tries to fathom what it is internationally that
allows children to be killed so gratuitously, to be turned into
child soldiers, mostly by obligation _ though sometimes they
voluntarily join because there is nothing else in the society that
gives them a sense of place _ to have them brutalized and to do the
brutalizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Otunnu, who was among the candidates for U.N. secretary-general
in 1996, said he intended to keep the issue on the Security Council
agenda, although there is limited scope for council action apart
from urging nations to abide by the 1949 Geneva Conventions and the
1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Somalia are the only two countries that
have not signed or ratified the convention on children's rights.
The Pentagon objects because efforts are under way to amend the
treaty to make 18 the minimum age for recruitment. Americans can be
recruited, but not sent into combat, at 17.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-nine countries recruit children under 18 or accept them as
volunteers for their armed forces. Guerrilla armies are rounding up
children as young as 8 or 10.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Security Council has limited power and no
experience in dealing with the problem, members agreed to take
children into account when discussing peacekeeping operations or
other responses to conflict. Some members called for a more formal
system of impact statements when any international military or
relief mission or the imposition of sanctions was being considered
by the council.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The growing phenomenon of children at war has begun to attract
considerable international attention. The European Union held a
meeting on June 22-23 and agreed to lend assistance to Otunnu's new
office and to put pressure on governments and others who abuse the
rights of children.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Japan's representative, Hisashi Owada, announced a
$100,000 grant to Otunnu and offered to stage an international
symposium on the issue for the Asian region.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday five private international organizations plan to
announce the formation of a coalition to fight for an international
prohibition against recruiting anyone under 18.
</P>
<P>
   The groups involved are Amnesty International, Human Rights
Watch, the Jesuit Refugee Service, the Quaker United Nations Office
in Geneva, Swedish Save the Children (on behalf of the
International Save the Children Alliance), and Terre des Hommes, a
European-based network of children's aid organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's debate, speaker after speaker took the opportunity
of an open session not limited to the 15 council members to raise
larger social issues not often aired in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of a wide range of countries spoke of what they
saw as a breakdown in community values. A Russian deputy
representative, Alexander Myevskiy, drew attention to the
prevalence of guns among children everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``A whole generation is growing up who do not know about a
school, a book or children's toys,'' he said, ``but who are very
sophisticated about modern weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the U.S. representative at the United Nations,
said that as civil wars increased, ``international standards and
principles are being swept aside, civilian populations are often
deliberately targeted and children suffer disproportionately.''
</P>
<P>
   Otunnu told the council about the tribal ethical code of
warfare, lapir, that he had learned as a child among the Acholi
people of northern Uganda, who believed that honor in battle meant
never harming civilians or their food supplies and livelihoods. He
contrasted that with the behavior of armies today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The moral center is no longer holding,'' he said. ``In so many
conflicts today, anything goes. Children, women, the elderly,
granary stores, crops, livestock _ all are fair game in the
single-minded struggle for power.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Wohlers ready to return to game
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Wohlers graduated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves closer will be joining the Richmond Braves, Atlanta's
Class AAA affiliate, tonight after working out in Orlando for the
past 10 days to regain his control. He is expected to be in
Richmond's bullpen in Durham, N.C., for the R-Braves' International
League game with the Durham Bulls, which this season beame a Tampa
Bay farm club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a matter of his delivery and mechanics and his
confidence in all those things,'' Atlanta general manager John
Schuerholz said. ``He'd gotten to the point where he had complete
confidence and consistency with all the pitches he was throwing. We
all just feel like it's time to go out and face some competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz took that recommendation in a Monday-morning
telephone call from special assistant Guy Hansen, who has been
working with Wohlers the past week at the team's minor-league
complex. Hansen will stop working with Wohlers, who now will pitch
for highly respected Richmond coach Bill Fischer, a long-time
fixture in the system who coached Wohlers during his minor-league
career.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves still have no master plan for Wohlers' return nor
will they estimate how long he will remain with Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``No general plan but to go pitch,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-20 club
</P>
<P>
   Both Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine will get one more start before
the All-Star break but with 11 wins each, both have a leg up on
twin 20-win seasons. It may not a rarity for them _ both reached 20
in 1992 and 1993 _ but it remains a rare feat in the National
League. Over the last 27 years, only two other clubs have had two
20-win pitchers _ San Francisco in 1993 with Bill Swift and John
Burkett and St. Louis in 1985 with Joaquin Andujar and John Tudor.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine has had three 20-win seasons, Maddux has had two but
neither has one since 1993. Maddux has subsequently twice won 19
while Glavine has topped out at 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty wins as a pitcher is the same thing as a hitter hitting
.300,'' Glavine said. ``It's kind of the number that's out there
all the time. I guess that defines a great season, rather than just
a good one. I still feel I can have a good season and not win 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Over his career, Glavine's winning percentage has dipped
slightly in the second half of the season (.635 to .574) while
Maddux's winning percentage has increased in the second half (.605
to .659).
</P>
<P>
   Simon says
</P>
<P>
   Batting .254 at Richmond when the Braves re-called him, Randall
Simon was hitting for his lowest average since his first season of
rookie ball (.254 at Danville in 1993). After hitting a career-high
.308 at Richmond last year, Simon explained the fall-off as a
combination of the International League's decision to pitch him
more cautiously and his own inability to lay off pitches off the
plate. Then he begain listening to Richmond hitting coach Max
Venable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been giving me the advice to go take more walks and give
my teammates an opportunity to do the job,'' Simon said. ``I've
started doing that more they they're starting to pitch to me a
little more.''
</P>
<P>
   That advice may have been lost in handling when he reported to
the Braves on Sunday. The first pitch he saw in his first at-bat,
he singled.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and cold
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko and Andruw Jones are swinging the hottest bats as
the Braves take their last road trip of the first half. Klesko
enters the Tampa Bay series with nine multi-hit games in his last
16 starts, while Jones is hitting .356 in June. Javy Lopez, who
takes an eight-game hitting streak into tonight's game, has 18 RBIs
in his last 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Tony Graffanino is in a 1-for-22 slump, followed
closely by Chipper Jones at 1-for-20.

 &HT;    In latest sports labor dispute, siding with owners is most
logical
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Just like their brethren in baseball, those on both
sides of this NBA labor fight between players and owners will bleed
forever. Nobody really wins these things. But if forced to make a
choice, take the owners in something like a second-round TKO.
</P>
<P>
   The players simply don't have a Joe Bugner of a chance during
this struggle for power of a sport that owns the best potential for
turning billions into trillions sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   With NBA arenas already filled at 91 percent capacity in recent
years, bigger and fancier arenas are on the way (translated: higher
ticket prices and more bucks for the league). Television gave the
NBA a $2.6 billion deal before last season. There also is the
foreign market. Given President Clinton's initiative with China,
who's to say buying Bulls' paraphernalia in Beijing won't become
more popular than visiting Mao's corpse?
</P>
<P>
   So, after the owners voted Monday to use an option in the
collective-bargaining agreement to impose a player lockout to get
more of the NBA's total revenue, the bell was rung. Although the
players continue to stick and move while saying they won't budge on
any of their gains through the decades, they eventually will rush
into a straight right along the way to what will be the ugliest of
defeats.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Steve Woods, the Atlanta-based Jerry Maguire of
an NBA agent, ``This is like Iraq against the United States. For
the sake of negotiations, Iraq has to talk tough, but for everybody
looking in from the outside, it is futile for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The same goes for the NBA players, and it starts with this: Of
the 400 players who ended this past season, 211 are free agents.
Among other things, the lockout prohibits teams from negotiating
player contracts. That means more than half of those in the league
will be without NBA-related income until this labor fight is over.
The players union says it has a fund to help those in need, but I'm
guessing that fund won't match the vast resources of their Muhammad
Ali counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   To worsen matters for the players, the NBA's new television deal
is guaranteed to pay the owners for an entire season.
</P>
<P>
   End of bout.
</P>
<P>
   This is disturbing in a way. Because this is America, we
shouldn't have salary caps or any of those other socialistic
controls that owners employ in professional sports to save
themselves from themselves. The last I checked, there wasn't a
report of Kevin Garnett shoving a knife against the throat of
Minnesota Timberwolves owner Glen Taylor to get that $126 million.
Still, the owners want the players to agree to an even tighter cap
that would keep salaries from rising at a rate dictated by supply
and demand. You know, one of our basic principles in the land of
the free.
</P>
<P>
   But here's why I'm not totally troubled by the owners winning
this fight in a romp: Everything else. In addition to keeping the
status quo financially, the players want the right to smoke
marijuana, to choose their coach, to choke their coach, to wear
shorts to their ankles, to miss practice, to ignore the media and
to ignore the fans.
</P>
<P>
   That's for starters. Given the lesser of both evils here, maybe
socialism isn't that bad.

YOUNG LAOTIANS' TROUBLED LIFE CAPTURED ON `P.O.V.' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kelly Saeteurn is a Dr. Laura kind of person _ the kind of
person Dr. Laura likes to tee up and smack down the fairway every
day on her radio show.
</P>
<P>
   A Laotian born in a refugee camp in Thailand and raised in
Richmond, Calif., Kelly was pregnant and unmarried when she
graduated from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend, Tony Saelio, was also Laotian and had served jail
terms for burglary and robbery. Kelly gave birth to their son and
began living with his family in Oakland. Things got drearier when
her family responsibilities interfered with her junior college
classes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where Dr. Laura reminds Kelly that she's been shacking up
and scolds her for having one child, then another, out of wedlock.
Then Dr. Laura goes into her backswing, pivots her hip and tells
Kelly to quit whining and sleep in the messy bed she's made for
herself.
</P>
<P>
   That would be about a 300-yard drive in Dr. Laura-land. But for
filmmaker Spencer Nakasako, Kelly and Tony are documentary film
subjects of the first order. The result is ``Kelly Loves Tony,''
airing Tuesday night on PBS' ``P.O.V.'' series.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, it's not even Nakasako's film. He arranged for Kelly
to get a camcorder when she graduated from high school, then let
Kelly and Tony record their own lives for the next year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   So ``Kelly Loves Tony'' is gritty, authentic and finally
mesmerizing, whether it's Tony training the camera on the
understandably moody Kelly as they squabble through another day, or
Kelly wearily holding a mike and unburdening herself in front of
the lens.
</P>
<P>
   It's a film in which Kelly is gripping American culture with a
desperate handhold, while the Iu Mien tribal culture of Laos pulls
at her ankles.
</P>
<P>
   She's painfully isolated in Tony's home, where custom dictates
that she assume an expanded domestic role. She feels she's getting
little help with the baby, and practically no understanding from
Tony, as she copes with schoolwork. Education isn't Tony's strong
suit. And Kelly wonders why neither Tony nor his family seems in a
hurry to get the wedding done.
</P>
<P>
   Tony comes across as jolly but clueless. In one exchange with
Kelly, he blithely starts a sentence with, ``If you were a real
woman ...'' She shoots him a laser look in return. Tony wonders _
(set ital)doh!(end ital) _ ``Did I jump into some stuff, or what?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a coin laundry, Kelly angrily hits Tony with her
opinion of the moment that he is a ``stupid dumb ass.''
</P>
<P>
   She might as well flog a sack of flour. The pudgy Tony simply
isn't equipped to receive bulletins. Alone afterward, he chirps
into the microphone, ``Our relationship right now is kind of not
perfect, you know?'' Yes, we noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Then Kelly finds out that she's pregnant again. You can imagine
Dr. Laura reaching for her putter to tap Kelly into the hole. But
to listen to Kelly, ruminating again about her in-laws, is to hear
the truth about the bicultural predicament of a young Asian
American woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they found out that I was pregnant, they were happy,''
she says. ``They didn't understand what the big deal is, having to
quit school and everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``To them, a kid should always come first. It's not like I
disagree with them or anything like that. It's just that I feel so
disappointed in myself.''

A LONDON FESTIVAL BRIGHTENS AMERICA'S ART IMAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ If New Yorkers have recently come away with the
impression that British theater is taking over Broadway and its
environs, they may feel reassured to know that American culture is
alive and well in London these days _ and not just through those
peculiarly American art forms, the Broadway musical and the
Hollywood blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to ``Inventing America,'' a $4.8-million festival
organized by the Barbican Center and sponsored by American
Airlines, London is being offered a smorgasbord of United States
arts through a program of theater, dance, visual arts shows, opera,
classical and contemporary music, jazz, and cinema, running from
January through November this year. The Barbican has called it the
biggest festival of American culture ever held outside the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Londoners, of course, might be forgiven for wondering why
American culture needs a fresh boost here. ``If you want to be
enveloped by America,'' one local critic sniffed, ``you don't need
to go to the Barbican: wander down any British High Street.''
Indeed, the transfiguration of postwar Britain by American popular
culture is hard to miss. But that is the Barbican's point: the rest
of American culture is rarely seen here.
</P>
<P>
   Put differently, while the latest American imports, like the
musicals ``Rent,'' ``Show Boat,'' and ``Chicago,'' have no
difficulty in finding West End theaters eager to receive them, only
a subsidized arts center like the Barbican _ it has a $38-million
annual grant from the city of London _ is able to present less
commercial aspects of American culture. Indeed, the festival could
easily have been called ``Discovering Another America.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted, quite unapologetically, to reflect the fact that
the United States is one of the major cultures of the 20th
century,'' Graham Sheffield, the Barbican Center's arts director,
said of ``Inventing America.'' ``The public's reaction has been
enthusiastic. Half the audiences are people coming to the Barbican
for the first time. Even some Americans were surprised. They said,
`We didn't think we were that interesting.' ''
</P>
<P>
   John Tusa, the center's managing director, is no less delighted
by the response because the American festival is also the highlight
of what has been tagged the Reinventing of the Barbican, a strategy
provoked by the Royal Shakespeare Company's decision not to use the
center, its traditional London base, from May through November each
year. ``We decided that this offered an opportunity to mount our
own season,'' Tusa said.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for this, after the Royal Shakespeare Company moved
out for the first time last summer, the center carried out
$3.2-million worth of refurbishment on the 1,156-seat Barbican
Theater. Now, equipped with two orchestra pits, a portable sprung
dance floor, better scenery storage and a new system of acoustic
enhancement, its stage can at last present opera and dance as well
as theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the American festival has worked as a brand relaunching for
us,'' Tusa explained. ``This is something that only the Barbican
Center could put on. No one else can offer a concert hall, two
theaters, extensive gallery space, a library for readings, and
several restaurants, all under one roof.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Inventing America'' nonetheless aspires to more than simply
filling the gap left by the Royal Shakespeare Company. The program
began with art exhibitions and concerts well before the company
ended its 30-week season in May. Then, as the company headed to the
United States to perform at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the
Kennedy Center in Washington, the Barbican Theater presented Robert
Wilson's ``Monsters of Grace,'' in collaboration with Philip Glass,
and Trisha Brown's new production of Monteverdi's opera ``Orfeo.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the highlights of the fall will be Peter Sellars'
production of the Chinese classic opera ``The Peony Pavilion,''
with the New York-based Chinese composer Tan Dun fusing both
traditional and new music for the occasion. This production, which
will later travel to Paris, Berkeley, Calif., and New York, is a
much shorter version of the opera than the Kunqu Opera Company
production that has thus far been prevented by Shanghai cultural
officials from traveling to New York for next month's Lincoln
Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the New York-based Acting Company presented the
British premiere of ``Love's Fire,'' seven one-act plays by
American playwrights based on Shakespeare sonnets (it has just
opened at the Joseph Papp Public Theater in New York). Also soon to
be seen for the first time in Britain are David Feldshuh's play
``Miss Evers' Boys''; ``2.5 Minute Ride,'' by the writer and
performance artist Lisa Kron; Roger Guenveur Smith's one-man show,
``A Huey P. Newton Story,'' and ``The Man Who Came to Dinner'' by
George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart in a new production by the
Steppenwolf Theater Company in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest novelty, though, is the dance program,
because it reflects Sheffield's determination to give contemporary
American and international dance a London home: until now, the
likes of Mark Morris and Pina Bausch were regulars only at the
Edinburgh Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Now, apart from Ms. Brown's choreography in ``Orfeo,''
``Inventing America'' will be presenting the Twyla Tharp Dance
Company in July and the Merce Cunningham Dance Company in October
as well as an all-American music program by the British
choreographer Siobhan Davies.
</P>
<P>
   This summer's visual arts centerpiece is ``The Warhol Look,'' a
touring exhibition organized by the Andy Warhol Museum in
Pittsburgh focused on the artist's obsession with glamour, style
and fashion. Two earlier shows this year, ``Shaker: The Art of
Craftsmanship,'' dealing with Shaker furniture, and ``The Art of
the Harley,'' which displayed 30 customized Harley-Davidson
motorcycles, drew the Barbican Art Gallery's highest attendance in
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   One recent setback was Cindy Sherman's decision to cancel an
exhibition of her work from the 1970s to the present day that was
scheduled to run from Sept. 10 to Dec. 13. ``It's a blow, no
doubt,'' said John Hoole, the Barbican's visual arts director.
``There was a lot of interest in the show, but I think Cindy wanted
a clean, white pristine space and she did not see the Barbican
giving her that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the fall, though, the center will present a different
kind of photography in ``Native North American: Photographs From
the Edge,'' which will include some 300 images of Indians made
between 1850 and 1914 as well as photographs of indigenous tribes
taken around the turn of the century by Edward Curtis. The
photography component of ``Inventing America'' has already included
an exhibition of some 90 portraits by the African-American artist
Dawoud Bey.
</P>
<P>
   In classical music, the Barbican Center has the advantage of
being the permanent residence of the London Symphony Orchestra,
which is naturally being kept busy, starting in January with a
concert performance of John Adams' opera ``Nixon in China,''
conducted by Kent Nagano, and continuing throughout the year with
numerous concerts of American music, among them four programs in
which John Williams will conduct his own compositions and a
celebration of Elliott Carter's 90th birthday to be conducted by
Pierre Boulez.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestras and ensembles visiting from the United States include
the New World Symphony Orchestra under Michael Tilson Thomas, the
Minnesota Orchestra, the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and the
Emerson String Quartet.
</P>
<P>
   Further, among soloists who have already performed here _ or
will in the fall _ are the sopranos Barbara Bonney, Kathleen
Battle, Dawn Upshaw, and Barbara Hendricks, the baritone Thomas
Hampson, the tenor Jerry Hadley, and the violinist Itzhak Perlman.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably appealing to a different audience is the program of
contemporary American music. The jazz section is particularly rich,
with the drummer Max Roach performing gospel songs with a New York
choir and performances by Herbie Hancock, Sonny Rollins, and George
Russell. Another section, ``Sing It Loud (I'm Black and Proud),''
focuses on the musical contribution of African-Americans in
everything from soul and blues to rock and rap, with Ray Charles
and James Brown on the program.
</P>
<P>
   More surprising, perhaps, ``Inventing America'' also includes
movies, albeit around specific themes. The Harley-Davidson
exhibition in the Barbican Art Gallery, for example, was
accompanied by so-called biker films like ``Easy Rider.'' Other
mini-series include Westerns, the American film noir,
African-American cinema, Hollywood musicals on screen and a
celebration of American B-movies like Roger Corman's ``Attack of
the Crab Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of this festival can hardly aspire to putting on
something this large every year, but they are determined to
reinforce the center's international profile by institutionalizing
what they called the Barbican International Theater Event as a way
of drawing more unconventional theater to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Already this year's non-American program involves a production
by St. Petersburg's Maly Drama Theater of ``The Possessed'' by
Dostoyevsky and a Japanese version of ``Hamlet,'' directed by Yukio
Ninagawa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can now fill a yawning gap in the London theater scene,''
Sheffield said of life without the Royal Shakespeare Company. ``I
imagine our becoming a mixture of the Brooklyn Academy of Music and
the Edinburgh Festival.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, American culture is not likely to drop from sight.
``Chicago'' and ``Show Boat'' look set for long runs and, although
``Rent'' received a mixed reception from London critics when it
opened here in May, it too is drawing big crowds and winning
standing ovations. And in the spoken word, two new American plays _
``The Old Neighborhood'' by David Mamet and Paula Vogel's Pulitzer
Prize-winning ``How I Learned to Drive'' _ have just had their
British premieres to warm reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, ``Inventing America'' may itself help smooth the way for
more noncommercial American culture here. Certainly, it has
prompted some Britons to think twice before engaging in what one
critic called ``sneering'' about the ``serious'' arts in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind our easy snobbery is a sense that Americans spend their
lives slobbed out either behind a wheel or in front of a
television,'' the critic Simon Hoggart wrote in The London
Guardian, ``as if most Britons were any different, except in the
greater poverty of our aspiration. The fact is that America is
stuffed to the gunwales with artistic talent and enterprise. It
just doesn't always take the same form as traditional European
pursuits.''

   NEW YORK _ For opera lovers and especially for Verdi
aficionados, Wednesday night at 7:30 is the time and the Central
Park Summerstage at the Rumsey Playfield at 72nd Street near Fifth
Avenue is the place.
</P>
<P>
   That is where Vincent La Selva and his New York Grand Opera
Company will begin their 25th successive season of free, fully
staged opera and the second half of their Viva Verdi! Festival,
which is offering all 28 Verdi operas in chronological order. The
attraction is ``Luisa Miller,'' Verdi's 15th opera, based on a
Friedrich von Schiller play and first performed in December 1849,
when the composer was 36.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Warning that France's cultural influence is waning, Jack Lang,
the former culture minister, on Monday proposed the creation of a
Ministry of Foreign Cultural Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In comments in the newspaper Le Monde, Lang, now a leader of the
Foreign Affairs Committee in Parliament, cited the decline of
French cinema and cuts of 15 percent in three years in the budget
to promote French culture abroad. A lack of action, he said, ``will
threaten our political influence and compromise our economic
opportunities.''

   Slice of Life

<P>
   The bagel and hand wounds go together like the bagel and lox.
Just ask emergency-room physicians and the pianist Andre-Michel
Schub, who sliced his right palm while slicing a bagel on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, Schub was scheduled to be the soloist
that evening with the Rochester Philharmonic in the demanding
Tchaikovsky Concerto No. 1 at the opening of the Vail Valley Music
Festival in Vail, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenia Zukerman, the festival's music director, thought he
might have to cancel. Schub refused to hear of it. Having declined
treatment, he played, won a standing ovation and then, still
bleeding, went off to the emergency room. The prognosis is for full
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, through Aug. 5, continues Wednesday when Robert
Bernhardt leads the Rochester in a program of arias and other music
from operas.

   Memorial
</P>

   Two new statues commemorating the Irish famine were dedicated on
Sunday in a $1 million, 6,000-square-foot downtown Boston park. The
sculptures by Robert Shure depict an anguished, starving family on
the Irish shore and a more hopeful one landing in Boston, where
more than 100,000 Irish immigrated as a result of the famine, which
began with a potato blight, led to the dispossession of farmers and
claimed an estimated 1 million lives from 1845 to 1851.

<HEADLINE>
FOR BIRD THE PLAYER, THE GAME WAS EVERYTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA is about to lock out its players, and you'll be hearing
a lot about the so-called ``Larry Bird Exception.'' It has to do
with money, and therein lies the irony: Larry Bird was never about
the money.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Larry liked money as much as the next guy _ ask anyone who
has ever uttered those fateful words (itals)Larry, I'll bet you
can't (fill in the blank)(unitals) _ but once the contract was
signed you never heard another word from Larry Bird about the
money. With Larry Bird, the game came first, second and always.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more money you paid him,'' Red Aurbach says, ``the more he
wanted to prove he deserved it.''
</P>
<P>
   You look back at it now, more than six years after his final NBA
game, and he really (itals)does(unitals) seem more like a legend
than one of the two greatest players ever to play in a Boston
Celtics uniform (no way I'm going to get bogged down in a
Bird-Russell debate today). The stuff Larry did, the things he
said, and the impact he had on both the franchise and the city
itself from 1979-92 could not have been scripted. When it comes to
Truth vs. Fiction, I'll take Truth, plus the points, every time.
And Larry Bird was the simple, unvarnished truth.
</P>
<P>
   To me, Larry Bird was, and always will be, the personification
of the sport, the one whose game was a microcosm of all the sport
has to offer. He could shoot, he could pass, he could rebound, he
could disrupt the other team's offense, and he could think three
steps ahead of the mortal players (pull out the tape of Houston
Game 6 in '86 if you want to see a man dominating every aspect of a
basketball game).
</P>
<P>
   The only other person who has ever seen what Larry saw and knew
deep inside what Larry knew was, of course, Magic Johnson, his
great friend and rival. Michael? No, Michael is different, as Larry
was first in the NBA to identify and then articulate. Michael
Jordan plays a different game. But don't ever think it's a better
one.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan is great, superb, the Man From Another Planet and
just generally beyond compare. That's a given, right?
</P>
<P>
   Well, uh, no. Give the '92 Michael and a completely healthy '86
Bird four comparable teammates, and I'll happily take my chances
with Larry Bird and his guys. One-on-one, no contest. Five-on-five,
bring 'em on.
</P>
<P>
   Has Michael Jordan ever dominated entire huge chunks of
basketball games without taking a shot? No, never. Larry Bird did.
Shooting was part of Larry's game, and not the best part.
</P>
<P>
   Return with me to Saturday, May 17, 1986. It is Game 3 of the
Eastern Conference finals against the Milwaukee Bucks. In the first
period Larry Bird, a forward, has seven assists. Six are layups,
real assists, old-fashioned assists, Tricky Dick McGuire assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a dealer in Three-Card Monte as Bucks came to surround
him,'' wrote the great Leigh Montville, ``and he neatly zipped the
ball through their arms, legs, whatever for easy baskets for
someone else. He was magic.''
</P>
<P>
   No forward has ever played the game this way. ``He gave me at
least five baskets where I didn't have to do a thing,'' said Kevin
McHale (speaking of quasi-fictional characters). ``All I had to do
was stand there. Didn't do a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had one thing on his mind at all times,'' says Auerbach,
``and that was to win. He made everyone around him play better.''
</P>
<P>
   When I think of Larry Bird, I don't think first of the huge
scoring outputs such as the 60-point game against the Hawks that
March night in New Orleans or the 9-for-10, 20-point fourth quarter
against Atlanta in '88.
</P>
<P>
   I think of the Boston Garden Heat Game against LA in '84, when
Kareem &AMP; Co. were sucking on oxygen and Larry was frolicking his
way to 15 for 20 and 17 rebounds in 97-degree heat. I think of K.C.
Jones saying practice would be called if anyone could sink a shot
from midcourt and Larry immediately grabbing the ball and
preventing practice with one shot. I think of him sitting in the
visiting locker room in Milwaukee's Mecca after being swept by the
Bucks and vowing to go home and come back a better ballplayer. I
think about him diving for the ball in Game 4 of the '87 Milwaukee
series and firing an amazing pass to McHale for a dunk from a
sitting position. I think of an inexplicable and completely
unnecessary 15-foot, lefthanded banker in the middle of a great
fourth-quarter, Game 7 run against Detroit in '87.
</P>
<P>
   I think about him spurning Jones's invitation to go for a
quadruple-double in Salt Lake City (``I've already done enough
damage''). I think about him calling a banked 3-pointer to New York
trainer Mike Sauders in the middle of a game. I think about him
standing in front of 20,000 people at City Hall Plaza and
describing the eating habits of Moses Malone. I think about him
taking $160 of Dan Shaughnessy's money by sinking 86 of 100 free
throws with his entire right hand taped shut. I think about him
returning to the Indiana Game 5 in '91 like the cavalry after
landing on his head in the second quarter. I think of the way he
used the media to get to the crowd before big games. I think about
him looking up at Bobby Orr's number 4 during the anthem, because
``when I retire, I want people to look at me the way they do at
him.'' I think about him saying, ``Tell Dudley Bradley to cut his
damn fingernails.''
</P>
<P>
   More legend: every year somebody or other sinks some threes and
sets a new record of some sort, but don't ever be fooled. I am here
to say that Larry Bird remains the King of the Three-Pointers
because no one has ever better understood the psychological effect
of the three better than Larry Bird. And I doubt if anyone will
ever match his 1986 25-for-34 3-point run from the real 3-point
distance, either. There are guys today who can shoot threes, but
only Larry Bird ever made it an art form.
</P>
<P>
   He always understood what real leadership was, and he never ran
from it. He knew he was different and better than everybody else,
and he knew what responsibilities went with the territory.
``There's no question I'm the leader of this team,'' he once said.
``Guys look at me and how I play and it determines how they play. I
know that. I recognize that. I don't mean running around and
everything on the floor. I might have done that my first few years,
trying to lead. I mean making the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Healthy or injured _ and when injured he simply refused to
discuss the matter _ he made plays when they were most needed. He
was the superstar with the 12th man mentality. No millionaire
player ever went after more loose balls. ``I don't ever want to be
sitting in a locker room after losing a game by 2 points thinking
back to a time when I could have gone to the floor and made the
play for those points, but didn't,'' he explained. ``That's never
happened to me once. And I don't want it ever to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It never did. The only thing left now is for Larry Bird to solve
the mystery. Once upon a time, he said, ``There's a secret to
playin' basketball. But I ain't tellin' what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 2, Larry Bird will enter the Basketball Hall of Fame.
Maybe that's when we'll find out.

GORAN ON GORAN: IDIOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The tall blackbearded man is cursing Goran Ivanisevic.
The tall blackbearded man is Goran Ivanisevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things I say to myself are terrible,'' he confesses, but
doesn't wish to tutor me in Croation naughtiness. ``No, I will not
tell you.'' Kind man, he wishes to spare my ears, if not his own,
and the others in Wimbledon's hazardous Court 2 who may not be deaf
to his native tongue.
</P>
<P>
   I know one word in Croation: idiot. Same as English. He directs
it at himself a lot. ``The rest is very bad, the adjectives, the
phrases,'' says a Croation journalist named Petar Radovic. ``Lucky
for him the umpire doesn't understand Croation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody understands Goran Ivanisevic, who lately has played
tennis more like an idiot than the incendiary he can be. Least of
all Goran. ``I am a movie ... interesting to watch ... a thriller
... but you never know how it will end,'' he says in his bass
voice, much deeper than his concentration.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like another unhappy ending for this 26-year-old,
6-foot vertical monument to erraticism for a couple of reels. A
burly Czech, Daniel Vacek, slugged away with Goran, toe to toe, for
the first 75 minutes of a 2-hour-13 minute shootout saga, and came
within a point of a two-set lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get two sets down, bye-bye,'' Goran is recalling after
his 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, 6-4 triumph that raised him to a
fourth-rounder against Todd Martin. ``But now is different.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he escaped wasn't. At 5-6, 30-40 _ the set point _
Ivanisevic, his mien as dark and menacing as the clouds that
shortly would deliver almost two hours of rain, raised his left arm
and blugeoned his 24th ace of the afternoon. Crash! Then, blam!
Along came No. 25, and trouble flew away with it. Let it rain. He
could _ and did _ finish up later.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yes, I know one other Croatian word: as. Ace. This should be
Goran's first name. The ace is for Goran what the knuckleball is
for Tim Wakefield _ life blood _ but a ton or two faster. Without
aces he is Bill Clinton minus lawyers, Milosevic without an army,
Keith Richards lacking a guitar, Michaela Larsen deprived of a
stove.
</P>
<P>
   Goran has so many aces up his short sleeve that if he were a
gambler in his movie, he would have been shot or run out of town.
Nobody has ever served as many at the Big W. He trumped Vacek with
44 of them, two short of his tournament record that he set last
year against Magnus Norman _ while losing the match. He holds the
season record, 1603 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is with him. Even flocks of them winging past
foes aren't always enough protection. He riddled Andre Agassi with
37 in the 1992 final _ and still lost.
</P>
<P>
   After six years in the top ten he has skidded to No. 25, a first
round fade-out in nine of 13 tournaments. After falling at the
opening hurdle of the Australian and French, he had an excellent
chance for a Grand Slop (first-round defeats in all four majors).
Goran blew it by beating Grant Stafford, And has kept going, the
forgotten guy looking better all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Goran can win this,'' says Pete Sampras. ``If he gets
going he can beat anybody. His serve can get very scary. You just
have to guess on it, and mostly you're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can beat them all, and maybe I will,'' Goran says. ``This is
the tournament I have the best chance of winning. Is really
different now.''
</P>
<P>
   What's different?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is new six months, a new time. I cannot play worse than
the first six months. I start to feel sorry for myself. Really
disgusted. I try to be cool. I'm not a cool guy. I have to explode,
yell at myself. I don't throw rackets _ but I should start again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not easy for me to hear all the talking that he's gone _
me _ can't play any more. Hurts. So I stop feeling sorry for
myself, and play, just enjoy no matter what happens. I'm happy
again, playing good again.''
</P>
<P>
   London bookmakers agree. His price has dropped to 6-to-1, same
as 1996 champ Richard Krajicek, behind Sampras's even money.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his growls and glares, Ivanisevic is a teddy bear of
great charm who never hides his feelings. When he lost to the
forgettable Dinu Pescario in _ of course _ the first round at the
1997 US Open, he declared, ``I should enter the women's tournament.
Maybe I can win first round. Maybe.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wimbledon's grass has been his foremost platform. Finalist
in 1992 and 1994, he's made $16 million and change in prize money,
and never won an important tournament. Is this a wonderful game or
what?
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day, when it's raining they show the 1992 final on
TV. I watch. I can't lose the way I'm playing ... but I do to
Agassi in five,'' Goran sighs.
</P>
<P>
   But he's still here, as impossible to figure as the weather, a
cloudburst of aces, and returning well, too. ``I have to win this
someday.'' If he holds the trophy on high Sunday, the tall
blackbearded man can call himself a ``pobjeda.'' That's success.

SAMPRAS PREVAILS AFTER LONG HAUL AGAINST ENQUIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Let's just say that it took a while to declare a winner
in the Pete Sampras-Thomas Enquist match. Four days, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   The players warmed up Friday, but rain forced a postponement to
Saturday. The match was then suspended by showers, and Sunday is a
mandatory off day.
</P>
<P>
   Monday they tried again and, after still another rain delay _
this one nearly three hours _ MondaySampras finally prevailed, 6-3,
7-6 (7-4), 7-6, (7-3). The top seed relied on old reliable, his
serve, which produced 29 aces.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras led, 6-3, 1-0, when play was suspended Saturday, but
Monday Enquist was playing better, holding serve fairly easily.
Sampras controlled the tie-breakers, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very tough,'' said Sampras, who has won only two
tournaments this year, at Philadelphia and Atlanta. ``Thomas is,
obviously, not as used to the grass-court surface compared to hard
court, but he serves very, very big (eight aces), especially his
second serve. And if he's going to serve that big, he's going to
hold serve on grass, and it came down to a couple of breakers.''
</P>
<P>
   During rain delays, players are given a 20-minute notice when
play is set to resume. ``Then, when it stops raining, you have to
get yourself emotionally keyed up again, get ready for the match,''
Sampras said. ``It's the same for everybody. It's not easy; you've
just got to try your best, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the rain delays, Sampras added, ``It's part of
Wimbledon, it's part of the aura about this place. You're going to
have a lot of rain delays, and we certainly had our fair share.
There's a lot of hanging around, a lot off dead time, and there's
nothing really you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been only been a so-so year for Sampras, to the point
where Richard Krajicek called Sampras only the ``10th player on the
tour'' a few days ago. Marcelos Rios overtook Sampras for the
world's No. 1 ranking for four weeks in late March, ending the
American's 102-week reign.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff doesn't really faze me,'' Sampras said. ``I know my
capabilities. I know how I'm playing this week. That's really my
main concern. The year has been a little bit up and down, but this
point last year, my year was pretty similar, except I won
Australia. So, whatever, it doesn't really faze me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was power against power in the Tim Henman-Patrick Rafter
outing, as Henman reached the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-7 (7-3),
6-3, 6-2 decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted to be through to the quarterfinals, but I do
feel very, very relaxed about the whole situation,'' said the
Englishman, the 12th seed. ``I surprised myself how relaxed I was.
I felt very loose in my whole game, the way I was serving. I wasn't
really trying to hit my serve particularly hard, but sometimes when
you've got good rhythm, that's when you serve best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Likewise on my returns, I was keeping it simple, and I think
that's when I do play best, when it's instinctively.''
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek, the 1996 champion and ninth seed, had to go through a
couple of tie-breakers in defeating Nicolas Kiefer in straight
sets, 6-4, 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-4). Krajicek has faced only four break
points in three matches, two against Kiefer.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the two break points, I served very good first serves and I
played a very good tie-breaker, especially in the second set,''
said Krajicek. ``I never return well, but if the serve and volley
is there, and if it's sharp, then I can still win these matches in
straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play a good returner like Nicolas, I think it's important
to mix it up, in the body, the speed, and the slice. So I think
that was maybe even more important than my first serve. I varied it
pretty well, and he couldn't see where I was serving my second
serve, so he was always guessing, and I think that is a good
thing.''

JUDGE EXTENDS INJUNCTION AGAINST WOODWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Louise Woodward can sell her story to tabloids,
television or the movies, but she won't be able to spend any of the
money until the wrongful death suit filed by the parents of Matthew
Eappen is resolved this fall.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Boston issued a preliminary
injunction &UR;  &LR; Monday against the former au pair which bars her from
spending any money she gets for her story and forces her to notify
the court and the Eappens' lawyer of any deals she makes.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing that the Eappens are likely to convince a jury that
Woodward was responsible for the death of their eight-month-old-son
-- as the state's highest court ruled two weeks ago, Judge William
G. Young took steps Monday to freeze Woodward's assets so money
will be available should the Eappens win their wrongful death suit
in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an overwhelming likelihood that (Sunil) Eappen will
succeed in establishing Woodward's civil liability for the death of
Matthew Eappen,'' Young wrote in a 21-page decision released
Monday. Sunil Eappen, Matthew's father, is administrator of his
son's estate and sued on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But since Woodward is a young woman of ``modest means,'' her
only potential asset is the value of her celebrity, which Young
termed ``a tragic irony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever their protestations,'' Young wrote, ``these parties
need each other in the most practical sense: absent insurance, if
Eappen is to have any chance to collect his expected judgment,
Woodward must amass the necessary funds, and the only potential
source appears to be the same media that all parties agree are most
morally repugnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens have said that any money received from the wrongful
death suit would go to a foundation they've set up in Matthew's
name to fight child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is questionable whether a British court will enforce
the injunction if Woodward violates it.  &UR;  &LR; While British courts
traditionally have upheld judgments from foreign courts _ such as
damages won in a lawsuit _ they are less likely to find a British
citizen in contempt of an American court order, legal experts have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fredric L. Ellis, the attorney representing the Eappens, was out
of town Monday and could not be reached for comment. Woodward fired
the lawyers representing her in the civil case last week and they
have not been replaced, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Following her conviction, Woodward and her parents insisted her
story was not for sale, calling any such deal ``distasteful and
inappropriate.'' She said she has turned down six-figure offers and
proclaimed, ``I have no intention of profiting from this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But 10 days ago, the Daily Mail newspaper, a British tabloid,
admitted it paid Woodward's parents $60,000 for an interview last
November. Since returning to England two weeks ago, Woodward's most
highly-publicized interview was with a BBC television news
magazine, for which she was not paid.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward went home after the state Supreme Judicial Court upheld
her conviction for manslaughter in the death of Matthew, who
prosecutors say died after Woodward violently shook him and struck
his head against a hard surface.
</P>
<P>
   A Middlesex jury convicted Woodward of second-degree murder last
fall, &UR;  &LR; but Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel reduced the verdict to
manslaughter and freed her on the 279 days she served in prison.
The SJC upheld Zobel's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours after the SJC ruling, attorneys for Sunil
Eappen filed the wrongful death suit in federal court. At the same
time, they asked Young to issue two orders: one requiring Woodward
to notify them and the court if she signed any contracts to sell
her story, and a second one barring her from spending the money.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's lawyers argued that such conditions would violate her
First Amendment rights but Young rejected that argument, noting
that Woodward is free to speak or write about her experiences and
sell her story.
</P>
<P>
   Young initially granted a temporary order which expired Monday.
The current injunction will remain in effect until the lawsuit is
concluded; the case is set for trial Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Although Woodward firing her lawyers ordinarily might delay
the case, Young said in his ruling Monday that he would not grant
any continuances.

5 WEAK KOREAN BANKS TO BE MERGED WITH `AMBULANCE BANKS' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The government's decision to close five
small weak banks has drawn a tepid response from economists, who
regard the move as a symbolic but largely ineffective start to
fixing the nation's ailing financial system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give them credit for making a first move,'' said Lee
Jeung-hoon, a banking analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in
Seoul, after the plan to merge the five banks into bigger,
healthier competitors was announced Monday. ``This is the
first-ever closure of any Korean bank, so it was a very brave thing
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, Daedong Bank will be closed and merged into
Kookmin Bank, Dongnam Bank into Housing and Commercial Bank,
Dongwha Bank into Shinhan Bank, Kyonggi Bank into Koram Bank and
Chungchong Bank into Hana Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In real terms, the closings will have little significance. The
five banks being closed hold only 7.2 percent of all the bad debts
in the banking system.
</P>
<P>
   The plan gave seven other shaky banks a reprieve and foisted new
problems onto the banks that will be forced to swallow their
cousins, nicknamed ``ambulance banks'' by an analyst, James Han, at
Jardine Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Supervisory Commission, the new regulatory agency
established to police the financial system, plans to spend 17.5
trillion won, or $12.65 billion, to buy nonperforming loans from
the five banks, add capital to the acquiring banks and establish a
reserve fund to buy whatever unforeseen problem debts arise in the
six months after the mergers.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts like Han worry about what will happen after six
months, especially when most market strategists see no end in sight
to the bankruptcies that are happening at the rate of between 2,000
and 3,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the longer term, there's likely to be greater costs for
the good banks than they would have had otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Not even the bank regulators are completely confident that they
have accounted for all of the problems at the five banks, or that
further problems will not arise. Indeed, reports in the local media
Monday said executives at Chungchong Bank met late Sunday night to
formally resign so that they would be eligible for severance
packages that cost the bank $35.7 million. The commission said they
would be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   This was the government's first move to solve the banking
crisis, which has hindered efforts to restructure the broad
economy. By some estimates, the South Korean banking system is
staggering under as much as $500 billion of soured loans
accumulated during years of state-directed lending that emphasized
relationships rather than credit quality.
</P>
<P>
   The process of forcing mergers in the banking sector reduces the
need to use the taxpayers' money for a bailout, a prospect the
government has dreaded at a time when the social safety net is
underfinanced and an average of 2,000 people a day are losing their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, foreign investors may end up bearing more of the cost
of cleaning up the banking system than they anticipated, a lesson
investors might bear in mind when considering a stake in any bank
in this region. Foreigners who have bought into the financial
system here have largely bought into those banks that are
considered relatively sound _ in other words, those banks forced to
merge with the worst banks.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Grand National Party on Monday accused the
government of playing favorites in determining which banks would
survive and which would die. Park Jie-won, President Kim Dae-jung's
spokesman, said that the selection process was ``very fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the federation of trade unions representing bank
workers promised to strike if the bank closings were carried
through. Several thousand people are likely to lose their jobs when
the banks are merged.
</P>
<P>
   More than 8,600 police officers were dispatched to each of the
five banks' headquarters and branch offices, but at some locations,
union demonstrators tried to prevent officials from the ``ambulance
banks'' from entering the banks scheduled for closing.
</P>
<P>
   At other sites, teams entering the banks to do the work of
merging computer and back office systems found that computer
passwords had been changed and doors to rooms housing computers
locked without any sign of a key. &QL;

AGENCY ORDERS PROTESTANT PARADE IN ULSTER REROUTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ The Northern Ireland Parades Commission Monday ruled
that a Protestant parade will not be allowed to march through a
Catholic neighborhood in Portadown next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Order, a fraternal group that organizes the parade,
vowed to defy the rerouting order, and violent confrontations are
expected.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three months of political progress that includes
the Good Friday agreement, its overwhelming endorsement by voters,
and the election of a new assembly last week, Northern Ireland's
fledgling spirit of accommodation will face its biggest test this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   There have been standoffs in Portadown over this parade in each
of the last three years, and widespread violence has flared the
last two years after nationalist protestors were forcibly removed
by police from blocking the Garvaghy Road, the disputed part of the
route.
</P>
<P>
   The decision creates a divisive Catch-22 in what recently has
been a more politically harmonious Northern Ireland. Many
Protestant unionists, already bitterly divided over the wisdom of
the Good Friday agreement, say they have compromised enough and see
the rerouting of the parade as a further erosion of their rights
and British identity.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic nationalists see this as a test of whether the
British government and the overwhelmingly Protestant police force
are serious about treating their concerns equally.
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the sensitivity of the situation, British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, are
scheduled to hold talks today about Portadown.
</P>
<P>
   Orangemen are named for King William of Orange, who in 1690
defeated the Catholic forces of King James II, establishing the
Protestant hegemony in Northern Ireland. They hold nearly 3,000
parades each year to celebrate that heritage. But most Catholics
consider the parades triumphalist and offensive, and they don't
want them passing through their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   David Jones, a leader of the Portadown Orange lodge that
organizes the parade, pointed out that his group has been marching
the same route since 1807 and sees no need to alter it. ``We don't
recognize the Parades Commission,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alistair Graham, the Parades Commission chairman, said the
decision to block the Orangemen from marching down the Garvaghy
Road was unanimous. It came after parade organizers refused to meet
with the local residents group that opposes the route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the absence of any positive move towards accommodation,
we cannot see at this stage how a parade could proceed again this
year without having a very serious impact on community
relationships, both locally and more widely across Northern
Ireland,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   According to him, the commission has also imposed restrictions
on a planned protest by Garvaghy Road residents that was to
coincide with the parade. Resident leaders said they would also
defy that ban.
</P>
<P>
   Both Graham and the British secretary of state, Mo Mowlam, said
they hoped that parade organizers and resident leaders could reach
an accommodation before Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But there seems little chance of that. The Orange Order
maintains that the residents group is a front for Sinn Fein, the
party that is linked to the Irish Republican Army, and refuses to
talk to its leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Garvaghy Road leader, Breandan Mac Cionnaith, who served
time in prison for IRA activity but denies any links with the IRA
or Sinn Fein, said his group still fears that the police chief,
Ronnie Flanagan, will overrule the commission and allow the march
to proceed as planned through his neighborhood. Flanagan has vowed
to uphold the commission's decision.

money until the wrongful death suit filed by the parents of Matthew
Eappen is resolved this fall.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in Boston issued a preliminary
injunction &UR;  &LR; Monday against the former au pair which bars her from
spending any money she gets for her story and forces her to notify
the court and the Eappens' lawyer of any deals she makes.
</P>
<P>
   Agreeing that the Eappens are likely to convince a jury that
Woodward was responsible for the death of their eight-month-old-son
-- as the state's highest court ruled two weeks ago, Judge William
G. Young took steps Monday to freeze Woodward's assets so money
will be available should the Eappens win their wrongful death suit
in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an overwhelming likelihood that (Sunil) Eappen will
succeed in establishing Woodward's civil liability for the death of
Matthew Eappen,'' Young wrote in a 21-page decision released
Monday. Sunil Eappen, Matthew's father, is administrator of his
son's estate and sued on its behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But since Woodward is a young woman of ``modest means,'' her
only potential asset is the value of her celebrity, which Young
termed ``a tragic irony.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever their protestations,'' Young wrote, ``these parties
need each other in the most practical sense: absent insurance, if
Eappen is to have any chance to collect his expected judgment,
Woodward must amass the necessary funds, and the only potential
source appears to be the same media that all parties agree are most
morally repugnant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Eappens have said that any money received from the wrongful
death suit would go to a foundation they've set up in Matthew's
name to fight child abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is questionable whether a British court will enforce
the injunction if Woodward violates it.  &UR;  &LR; While British courts
traditionally have upheld judgments from foreign courts _ such as
damages won in a lawsuit _ they are less likely to find a British
citizen in contempt of an American court order, legal experts have
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fredric L. Ellis, the attorney representing the Eappens, was out
of town Monday and could not be reached for comment. Woodward fired
the lawyers representing her in the civil case last week and they
have not been replaced, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   Following her conviction, Woodward and her parents insisted her
story was not for sale, calling any such deal ``distasteful and
inappropriate.'' She said she has turned down six-figure offers and
proclaimed, ``I have no intention of profiting from this tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But 10 days ago, the Daily Mail newspaper, a British tabloid,
admitted it paid Woodward's parents $60,000 for an interview last
November. Since returning to England two weeks ago, Woodward's most
highly-publicized interview was with a BBC television news
magazine, for which she was not paid.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward went home after the state Supreme Judicial Court upheld
her conviction for manslaughter in the death of Matthew, who
prosecutors say died after Woodward violently shook him and struck
his head against a hard surface.
</P>
<P>
   A Middlesex jury convicted Woodward of second-degree murder last
fall, &UR;  &LR; but Superior Court Judge Hiller Zobel reduced the verdict to
manslaughter and freed her on the 279 days she served in prison.
The SJC upheld Zobel's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours after the SJC ruling, attorneys for Sunil
Eappen filed the wrongful death suit in federal court. At the same
time, they asked Young to issue two orders: one requiring Woodward
to notify them and the court if she signed any contracts to sell
her story, and a second one barring her from spending the money.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward's lawyers argued that such conditions would violate her
First Amendment rights but Young rejected that argument, noting
that Woodward is free to speak or write about her experiences and
sell her story.
</P>
<P>
   Young initially granted a temporary order which expired Monday.
The current injunction will remain in effect until the lawsuit is
concluded; the case is set for trial Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Although Woodward firing her lawyers ordinarily might delay
the case, Young said in his ruling Monday that he would not grant
any continuances.

YOUNG DANCERS POUNCE INTO BATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Del., Denmark)  (lb) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ It is a marvelous anomaly that many of the
world's finest young ballet dancers have just spent two weeks
performing in this otherwise somnolent capital city of some 200,000
people. Jackson, after all, can lay claim to some cultural
sophistication as the home of Eudora Welty, but it is still small
and rural enough that the lead newspaper article one recent day was
about vandalism at a hog farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some irony in a relatively obscure Southern town
hosting this event,'' the mayor, Harvey Johnson, acknowledged in an
interview. And virtually everyone in town agreed it felt sort of
odd to have the dancers here, though they have been to Jackson
before.
</P>
<P>
   The event was the sixth U.S.A. International Ballet Competition,
which ended last weekend. Every four years or so since 1979, it has
brought ballet coaches, company directors and choreographers from
five continents here to view dancers they might not have a chance
to see anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at a time when international competitions are
proliferating around the world _ there are now about 15 of them,
including the triennial one in New York, the sixth of which will
occur in June 2000 _ Jackson's, astonishingly enough, may well be
the best attended, most fiercely contested of them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now the world's premier competition,'' said Bruce
Marks, artistic director emeritus of the Boston Ballet, implying
that in ballet these days, even the competitions compete.
</P>
<P>
   Marks has a bias; he has served as chairman of the jury for the
last three competitions in Jackson. But he isn't necessarily wrong.
Past grand prix winners in Jackson have included Jose Manuel
Carreno, the Cuban dancer who is now a principal at American Ballet
Theater, and Andris Liepa, the former Bolshoi and Kirov star.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, for many ballet companies, it is their best
opportunity to fill openings. And for many dancers, in the United
States and overseas, it is their best opportunity to be seen, to
assess their standing in the world of dance, perhaps to earn a
little prize money and, most important, to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 87 dancers from 26 countries (including New Zealand,
Australia, Mongolia, Cuba and South Korea, as well as Eastern and
Western Europe and South America), all selected from applications
and videotapes, joined the competition. There were three rounds,
with dancers eliminated after the first two. By round three, 37
dancers remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important to me to get to the third round, so I would
get to perform all the solos I prepared,'' said Lenaig Guegan, 22,
a French dancer who is a member of the Royal Danish Ballet in
Copenhagen, and was hoping, with her boyfriend and fellow dancer,
Bernard Courtot de Bouteiller, 24, to attract the attention of
other artistic directors. ``We're a bit bored where we are,'' she
said. He added, ``If we could get a contract somewhere, that would
be great.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a provocative thing, throughout the week, to hear the
dancers routinely referred to as ``competitors,'' to see the
women's senior gold-medal winner, a 24-year-old Russian dancer,
Anna Antonicheva, burst into tears like a beauty-pageant winner at
the announcement of her triumph, and to see Ms. Guegan so obviously
despondent after winning a merit award but not one of the main
prizes.
</P>
<P>
   She and Courtot were among many at the event who decried the
idea of applying the numerical standards of sport to an art form,
though everyone conceded that the audition was no less competitive
in its way and that all performers needed a competitive spirit to
match their expectations of themselves.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Competing, but With Whom?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that in dance you should compete for a
title,'' said Elisabeth Carroll, a coach and former dancer with
American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey and Harkness ballets. ``You
compete with the audience, and in that sense you have to win every
night. The difference is you make your competitors happy. Here you
want to make them sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Competitive events discourage the expression and feeling that
are the main business of art, the argument goes, and encourage
dancers to be sensational and superficial, to rely on the
gravity-defying athletic leaps and diverse turns on toe that draw
gasps from an audience _ ``the flash and bash,'' in the words of
the prominent dance coach David Howard _ but have little to do with
the evocative grace of the art; jumping, after all, is not dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often wondered if we lived in outer space, would we be
trying so hard to get to earth?'' Howard said. For the audience,
too, a competition is an odd experience.
</P>
<P>
   What was presented in Jackson was not a finished ballet
performance, with its arcs of narrative and music and variety of
choreographed passages. Rather, the evenings consisted of
individual dancer after individual dancer (with the occasional pair
thrown in), each offering a few minutes from the 19th-century
classical repertory (solos from works like ``Esmeralda,'' ``Don
Quixote'' and ``Paquita,'' and pas de deux from ``Sleeping Beauty''
and ``Le Corsaire'') and later, something contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   They were bite-size ballet nuggets filled with leaps and turns,
the dance equivalent of a football highlight film or an Olympic
gymnastics event. And when Renata Pavam Maia, a 16-year-old from
Brazil who would win a silver medal, danced the final round with a
bandaged ankle, wincing through her performance and weeping as she
took her bows, it seemed an echo of Kerri Strug.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, everyone acknowledges that the competitions
are effective professional tools, clearinghouses where dancers'
talents can be displayed, discussed and bartered. And for all their
ambivalence, dancers do want to win, because with winning comes the
imprimatur of supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   All this puts an unusual burden on the judges, who must try to
see beyond the flash and bash of each dancer in order to assess his
or her artfulness. The 13 judges, all from different countries,
awarded no grand prix this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that means is that we didn't think anyone was ready to
leap onto the stage at the Metropolitan Opera at just this
moment,'' Marks said. ``We definitely saw the potential for that,
though.''
</P>
<P>
   They did award some $60,000 in prizes and scholarships to 21
dancers, including Ms. Guegan (a merit award in the name of Robert
Joffrey, the jury chairman of the first competition), Courtot (who
won a silver medal) and Rasta Thomas, from Washington, who won the
top prize in the senior men's division, though he is only 16. (The
junior division was ostensibly for dancers 15 through 18; the
senior, 19 through 26.)
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, a principal with the Hartford Ballet, doesn't even want
to be a dancer. A student of martial arts with aspirations to
attend the Yale School of Drama, he exhibits a supernaturally
flawless charm (``The pleasure is all mine'' he is wont to say
after a handshake), and he intends to be the next Hollywood action
hero. ``I want to inspire, I want to be a legend, I want to be
president of the United States, I want to be so much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Begun With Energy and Fund Raising
</P>
<P>
   Major international competitions date back to 1964, when the
first one was held in Varna, Bulgaria; it and eventually expanded
into a series of contests that rotated annually among Varna, Moscow
and Tokyo. (When Tokyo withdrew in the early 1980s, it was replaced
by Helsinki, Finland.)
</P>
<P>
   It was in the mid-1970s that a well-known New York ballet
teacher named Thalia Mara, who has just turned 87, moved to Jackson
to run the local ballet company. It was her fund raising and
energy, along with the efforts of Joffrey and the dance critic
Walter Terry, that brought the American version of the event to
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   The event pumps some $6 million into the city's economy, and it
has remained here because Jacksonians volunteer by the hundreds,
provide accommodation for dancers in their homes and generally
treat the visitors with a hospitality that is downright, well,
Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the practice in other competitions, for instance, dancers
eliminated in the early rounds are invited to stay, at no cost, to
participate in classes and workshops, to attend all performances
and to dance in a choreographed group performance at the closing
gala.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is so nice here,'' the foreign dancers said last
week, again and again, often with noticeable incredulity. And some
of them even liked the early-summer heat, which had stunned the
city torpid. ``It keeps my muscles warm, so that's good,'' said
Anna Ivanova, who is the principal dancer at the Russian Ballet
Theater of Delaware, in Wilmington. She was born in Siberia.
</P>
<P>
   For admittedly sports-minded Jacksonians, the event was clearly
an opportunity to mix the culture of the concert hall with the
culture of the stadium. (White Jacksonians, anyway. In a city that
is half black, the homogeneity of the crowd was striking.)
</P>
<P>
   Night after night, they filled the 2,400-seat Thalia Mara Hall
downtown, whooping for their favorites in mid-dance and launching
``bravos'' and ``bravas'' from the mezzanine.
</P>
<P>
   They even seemed to like the contemporary offerings of the
dancers, though most of the professional dance observers found
them, with a few exceptions (like Courtot's performance of his own
choreography of ``The Rite of Spring'') poorly chosen at best,
ponderous and pretentious at worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a serious taste problem with the contemporary stuff,''
said Marks, adding that next time he might well have all the
dancers prepare a piece selected in advance by the jury. For all
the complaints, in the end, almost everyone found the event
gratifying, with Ms. Ivanova giving a particularly measured
assessment of her experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first round was kind of scary, but now I like it,'' she
said after her final performance in round three. ``It's different
from dancing with a company. This is a little harder. You don't get
a second chance to try again another night, with a different
preparation. And you have more responsibility, because with a
company you have their support. It's difficult for everyone to
compete, but if you don't want to compete, you don't come.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused. This was before the results were announced, before
learning she had not won a prize. ``Of course it matters if I win,
but it's more important that I performed well, that I did my
best,'' she said, realizing that at 25, she may have come too late
to the joys of competing. ``This is my first competition, and I'd
like to come back. But now I'm too old.''

CLINTON GETTING HIGH MARKS FOR CHINA PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China -- A week ago - even a few days ago - White
House officials viewed President Clinton's foray into China with
near palpable fear. The trip began so dismally that President
Clinton's most senior foreign policy adviser stood in a roomful of
reporters in Xian and pleaded for them not to hastily declare it a
failure.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as Air Force One left Beijing for Shanghai on the third
leg of the trip, those same officials were ecstatic, filled with a
sense that Clinton's performance in the televised news conference
and his Beijing University address helped him realize his most
important goals: He spoke directly to the Chinese people,
coherently articulated a strong view on human rights and developed
a closer relationship with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared ebullient Monday. He was relieved enough to
take the afternoon off in his Chinese government guesthouse in
Beijing to play cards and board games with family and friends
before flying here for a fresh round of speeches on the Chinese
economy. He took a quick limousine ride Monday night to see
Shanghai's city lights before retiring early to his hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Aides spoke in unfiltered awe about Clinton's performance. White
House spokesman Michael McCurry called it ``an important moment of
transformation in China.'' Stanley Roth, the ranking State
Department official on China, said it would have ``profound
reverberations.'' Even Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in an
unusually impolitic assessment, said she was surprised by the
degree of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of raising issues by both presidents, and their
interchange with each other, I think is something that frankly was
not expected,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, administration officials were puzzling Monday over the
long-term impact that the weekend summit would have on the future
relationship between the United States and China, and most said it
would take weeks and even months to find the answer. It is a
relationship, they cautioned, that moves forward not in yards or
even feet, but in inches -- when it moves forward at all.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, they said, the trip would probably not lead to any
sort of post-Tiananmen Square phase in US-Chinese relations, and
they warned that the political climate in Beijing today should not
be compared to Moscow before the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``As to what happens next, we don't know,'' conceded Susan
Shirk, the deputy assistant secretary of State for East Asian and
Pacific Affairs. ``I don't think it would be wise to say this opens
up a whole new era in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Still unclear was why Jiang decided to air the news conference
Saturday on national television, allowing Chinese citizens the
unusual -- if not unprecedented -- chance to see a foreign leader
criticize the government and offer a pointed condemnation of the
1989 Tiananmen Square massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Most aides believed Jiang felt confident enough with his
domestic standing in China to allow the two broadcasts, and he
wanted to help Clinton address critics at home who had chided the
White House for his China mission and policy of engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech Monday, and the subsequent question and answer
session with hard-line students, was also aired live. But much of
the broadcast was inaudible on China's state-run television
network. White House officials Monday said they believed the
problem was unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the students' questions were particularly pointed. One
student was applauded when he asked if there were problems with
democracy and human rights in the United States. Another asked
Clinton how he would feel if students protested his appearance at
Beijing, as students protested against Jiang when he appeared at
Harvard last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, analysts said Clinton rescued his policy with his
weekend performance, at least for now. They added that critics
would still charge that Clinton failed to meet with dissidents
during his trip, and that his official welcoming ceremony on
Tiananmen Square, where a 21-gun salute eerily echoed off nearby
walls, was a potential public relations disaster. But they added
that his pointed lectures on human rights Saturday and Monday would
help him gain support on Capitol Hill for his approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both Clinton and Jiang Zemin took risks, and the gambles paid
off for both of them,'' said David M. Lampton, director of China
studies at Johns Hopkins University and the Nixon Center. ``One
doesn't want to exaggerate the accomplishments, but this was
certainly a step forward, whether your priority was human rights or
economic concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stephen Yates, a China scholar with the conservative
Heritage Foundation: ``His press conference was extraordinary. The
only thing that limited it was that it took place in the middle of
the night back home.''
</P>
<P>
   When pressed, some administration officials conceded that the
summit failed to yield the substantive gains by which these affairs
are usually measured. Little progress was made,for example, in
helping China gain admission to the World Trade Organization and
the other fair trade issues that are pegged to that -- a main
concern of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our relationship with China deals with a whole host of
issues,'' said Albright, in a session with reporters. ``The trade
agenda was not one that was particularly moved forward during this
summit.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, China made little movement toward signing a pact that
would severely limit its ability to send missiles to its allies.
Chinese leaders also deferred signing its endorsement of an
international human rights accord.
</P>
<P>
   But aides and analysts said this was a summit about
communication, not treaties, and the most important victory came in
the image of Clinton, beamed to a potential audience of some 600
million viewers in a country of 1.2 billion people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had any expectation for blockbuster agreements,'' said
Nicholas Lardy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute in
Washington. ``A lot of the issues outstanding are very fundamental.
China is not going to totally transform their human rights
practices. We are down to some very hard issues that are not going
to be resolved fully, and the best one can hope for is a candid
airing of views, and that each side understands the other's
perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   Said McCurry: ``No one's necessarily naive that we've seen a sea
change in behavior'' on the part of Chinese officials. He rattled
off thorny issues where little progress was made, such as trade and
political dissidents. Then he added, ``But these differences have
to be seen in a new light. There's a much more engaged strategy for
dealing with them on both sides.''

RENO LASHES OUT AGAINST VIOLENCE, URGES HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno went on the offensive
Monday against violence that involves children, urging schools to
train teachers to confront conflict and calling for children who
are victims of domestic disputes to receive counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are perpetuating domestic violence from one generation to
another. If we cannot end it in our homes, how can we expect to
keep it off our streets,'' Reno told students from the Presidential
Classroom Scholars, sponsored by the Presidential Classroom civic
and education organization.
</P>
<P>
   Reno told some 300 high school students from 46 states, Canada,
Cuba and Russia that 40 percent of homicides in America result from
violence in the home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The child who watches his father beat his mother comes to
accept violence as a part of life,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said she hoped to see programs that offer counseling for
children who witness domestic violence, and a program that would
require every certified teacher to take a course on helping
children resolve conflict ``without knives and guns and fists.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, schools need to teach about the perils of
drug use.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to change the rhetoric of America, which politicizes
drugs,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Raising an issue that haunted President Clinton during his first
two years in office, Reno called for improved health care for
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong with a nation that says to a 70-year-old
person, you can have an operation to extend your life expectancy by
three years, but turn to a five-year-old who has a ... disease and
say, sorry, your parent makes too much money to be eligible for
Medicaid, and she doesn't have enough money for insurance,'' Reno
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration proposed an extensive overhaul of the
national health care system in 1993, but it failed the following
year when the issue foundered in Congress. The administration
sought to build a network of health care providers for the 38
million Americans not covered by private insurance; Medicaid, the
program for poor people; or Medicare, which provides coverage for
the elderly and disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In her address to the students, Reno never explained how such
programs would be paid or whether the federal government should
take the lead in paying for violence counseling and anti-drug
programs in schools.
</P>
<P>
   Reno urged the students to focus on the future and be positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can't make this world a better place,'' she said,
``but if that be the case, unless I fight as hard as I can, it's
going to get a lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy Korona, a student from Bishop Ireton High School in
Alexandria, Va., said Reno had good ideas, but she omitted
specifics about methods of changing educational programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``She mentioned paying teachers well ... where is that money

DUTCH `PITBULL' SCORES GOAL TO DEFEAT YUGOSLAVIA, 2-1

<P>
   TOULOUSE, France _ Edgar Davids, the man Holland knows tenderly
as ``the pitbull'', is back, lifting the Dutch side to a 2-1
victory over Yugoslavia with a magnificent last-minute goal.
</P>
<P>
   In Davids' elation after his 20-yard left-footed shot nestled in
the corner of the net, there was more than the average happiness of
a goal scorer. There was the heady fury of vindication after a long
spell in the cold. And in his joyous post-match embrace with coach
Guus Hiddink, there was reconciliation at last.
</P>
<P>
   In a country that produces talented soccer players with the same
regularity as it grows tulips, Davids stands out as an unusually
gifted midfield player. Mobile, tireless and tremendously
aggressive, he was such a force of nature at Ajax Amsterdam that
Louis Van Gaal, the great coach of that great club, dubbed him
``the pitbull.''
</P>
<P>
   The name stuck. But Davids' aggressive nature was not confined
to the pitch. Born in Surinam, raised on the wrong side of the
tracks in Amsterdam, black in a predominantly white country, he was
easily riled. When Hiddink dropped him from the Dutch during the
European Cup in 1996, Davids accused him of racism. Hiddink told
him to pack his bags and go home.
</P>
<P>
   Davids' international career seemed over. Moving to AC Milan, he
was dropped. Last year, he broke his leg. But then, six months ago,
came redemption. Signed by Juventus, Davids suddenly clicked back
into form, lifting the Italian club to the championship this year.
Hiddink simply could not ignore him.
</P>
<P>
   The coach told David the rules. He told him what he expected
from him. And he put the 25-year-old player back in the heart of
the Dutch midfield, where it is now hard to imagine the team
without him.
</P>
<P>
   Davids was flanked Monday by Clarence Seedorf of Real Madrid and
together they gave the Dutch midfield an authority that held
through much of a see-saw match. But the Yugoslavs are maddening
opponents. They can seem utterly mediocre for long spells, and
entirely defensive, before springing to life. More a collection of
stars than a cohesive team, Yugoslavia could nevertheless have won
this game.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was all Holland, but the team found it hard to
create clear chances. The Yugoslav goalkeeper, Ivica Kralj, saved
well from Seedorf in the 29th minute, after good work by
right-winger Ronald de Boer.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 38th minute, one of Holland's many world-class
players, center-forward Dennis Bergkamp, struck. Latching onto a
long pass from Frank de Boer, he controlled the ball and shot
right-footed in a single movement. Surprised, Kralj could only get
a hand to it and the ball bounced off him into the net.
</P>
<P>
   But three minutes into the second half, Yugoslavia equalized,
when left-back Slobodan Komljenovic rose at the far post to head in
a free kick. Two minutes later, Yugoslavia had a penalty, when
Dutch center-back Jap Staam fouled Vladimir Jugovic, tugging his
jersey as he prepared to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   There are few better penalty shot-takers than Predrag Mijatovic,
the Yugoslav striker who plays for Real Madrid. But with the
pressure on him, Mijatovic blasted his shot against the underside
of the bar and it bounced out.
</P>
<P>
   With the night humid, and the players tiring, it seemed the
match would go into ovetime. But with seconds remaining, Davids
collected a corner kick on the left edge of the penalty box. He
pushed the ball forward and blasted an unstoppable shot into the
lower left corner of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Holland, which twice reached the final of the World Cup, in 1974
and 1978, with one of the greatest teams never to win soccer's
supreme tournament, was through to the quarterfinal, where it will
meet the winner of Tuesday's England-Argentina game.
</P>
<P>
   After the match, Hiddink said he had thought of taking Davids
off with ten minutes to go because the midfielder had strained a
muscle. ``It was a happy non-decision that I left him on the
pitch,'' he said. Hiddink did not say it, but it was also a happy
decision that he had brought his ``pitbull'' in from the
wilderness.

 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Liam Neeson didn't look so scary. The large, almost
lumbering screen presence from films like ``Schindler's List'' and
the current ``Les Miserables'' just seemed tall and slim in person,
with more delicate facial features than those of the lovers and
fighters he has played.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was just tired. Understandably. It was a Friday
afternoon, roughly halfway through a 14-week Broadway run of ``The
Judas Kiss'' (it closes Aug. 2) in which he plays Oscar Wilde in
two conditions: doomed and drained.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard, you know,'' said Neeson, seated in a back booth at
Cafe des Artistes in Manhattan. ``It's such an emotional journey
for me every day. He's practically a broken man, which two years'
hard labor did to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson becomes that broken man eight times a week, portraying
Wilde in 1895 (Act I), just as he makes the decision not to flee
England but to stay and face imprisonment for homosexual acts, and
in 1897 (Act II), just after his release. ``You just have to go
there,'' he explained, referring to the psychological demands of
the role. ``Otherwise there's no point in doing it, you know. And
sometimes it pays off, and other times it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   And after you do it, the challenge is in leaving behind the
character's mind set when the curtain goes down, in order to live
as a sane person at least a few hours of the day. Neeson has
developed a system for that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm helped by a wonderful dresser called Helen Toth,'' he
said, ``and a glass of the best French red wine I can get.''
</P>
<P>
   What exactly does Ms. Toth do to help? Neeson made the motion of
twisting a corkscrew. ``A lovely ceremony whereby she pops the cork
as I'm just reaching for the towel; we've got it all totally
synchronized,'' he explained. ``One glass of that gets rid of Oscar
Wilde.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Neeson was drinking only Pellegrino, with a
salmon omelet and vast quantities of brown bread. He was dressed in
a casual, very un-Wildean way _ navy jacket, gray shirt, black
jeans, rimless glasses _ and was eager, he said, to get home to
spend time with his two sons, who are at that ``running about''
stage (ages 3 and almost 2.)
</P>
<P>
   The children are the focus of his weekends, when he and his
wife, Natasha Richardson, take them to the country. One recent
exception, however, was the weekend of the Tony Awards (June 7) at
Radio City Music Hall, where he presented an award and Ms.
Richardson was honored as best actress in a musical for her
portrayal as Sally Bowles in ``Cabaret.'' Later that evening, the
two embraced and kissed for the cameras during a brief appearance
at the post-awards supper.
</P>
<P>
   It was a subject of much discussion when Neeson didn't receive a
Tony nomination for ``The Judas Kiss.'' His New York reviews had
been all over the place, describing his work as astonishing,
enthralling and ``the performance of the year'' on one end of the
scale, and as actorly and ``a bit of a snooze'' on the other.
Reviews also sometimes included comments on his having been cast in
the role at all (``boldly against type,'' ``slightly perverse,''
``a calamity''). The play, by David Hare, elicited equally mixed
adjectives (from brilliant, luminous and ``cleverly elliptical'' to
static and ``mind-numbing'').
</P>
<P>
   Neeson laughed off the Tony controversy (``I'm always joking
with Natasha,'' he said. ``I'm not concerned about the Tonys, but
I'm very upset about the Fanys,'' a group of New York
people's-choice awards) and complimented his audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York audiences are so responsive, you know, incredibly
interested,'' he said. London theatergoers, he explained, sometimes
``came with a preconceived idea of who Oscar Wilde was, hoping to
see this dandy, this fop who would come out with one-liners, and
that's not what David Hare has written.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Neeson does see Wilde as a colorful, fascinating
character. In fact, he professes a certain national possessiveness
about the man and ``his love of words.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The English tend to claim him as their own, but he wasn't,''
said Neeson. ``He was very, very Irish, brought up in a very strong
tradition of Irish storytelling.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mother was this huge, outrageous Irish nationalist and was
a bit of a cult hero,'' continued Neeson, who is from Ballymena,
Northern Ireland. ``She always had an open door to visiting artists
and lecturers. So he grew up in this extraordinary educated world:
of books, yes, but of people coming from all walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilde's father, he pointed out, was a noted eye and ear surgeon
who died in Oscar's youth. In what Neeson called ``one of these
strange twists of fate,'' Wilde died of an ear infection, one that
his father probably could have cured.
</P>
<P>
   Before portraying Wilde, Neeson paid a visit to the Off Broadway
production of ``Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I wanted to cut down on my research,'' he said. ``I
thought, `Well, if I see this play, and it's taken from the
transcripts, it's going to save me really a lot of boring books.' I
loved it. I thought it was a wonderful production. It was sort of
like a fascinating documentary, but I was moved by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson said he believed there had been some negative reaction to
his having taken on the role. ``I sensed that there was a kind of a
gay thing, of a heterosexual playing Oscar Wilde,'' he said.
``There were some actors, some very well-known actors, who came
backstage who didn't even deign to say, `Congratulations, well
done,' which is the basic you should always say, even if you hate
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson finds the concern puzzling. ``We're not talking about a
different species,'' he said, looking amazed that anyone could
consider playing a person of different sexual orientation that
great a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   When Neeson wants to get away from opinions like that, and from
pretty much everybody, his passion is fly-fishing and has been for
the last four years or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very absorbed in that,'' he said. ``There's incredible
paraphernalia. Each rod is totally different and has a different
action, action being the sway of the rod and how it throws the line
out. There's an art form in casting. Basically what you're trying
to do is imitate a fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not terribly successful at catching fish,'' he added,
``but that's not why I do it really.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled a day last year during the filming of ``Star Wars:
Part 1.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to this little bed-and-breakfast hotel very near
Stonehenge,'' he said. ``And it had a lovely river running beside
it, and I took a rod out. It was the most gorgeous, idyllic day.''
He described having seen a kingfisher flying, moorhens and
butterflies, like a Walt Disney movie come to life, he said. ``And
I got a couple of great bites on that line, which was thrilling.''
</P>
<P>
   He is familiar with the book ``Fly Fishing Through the Midlife
Crisis,'' he said, but contended that he wasn't fazed by his recent
birthday, his 46th, which fell on Tony Awards night. And, he said,
he had made it through his 40th birthday without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I freaked out at 30,'' he recalled. ``I was actually doing
what I always dreamed I'd be doing. I was on location doing a film,
in the Dolomites in the middle of Italy. I wasn't working that day,
so I stayed in my room and went through this miserable depression.
This was my little exorcism.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was romantically unattached at the time (which might
have contributed to his gloomy outlook), he said: ``No, I wasn't.
But she wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Neeson was linked with a number of famous women (including Helen
Mirren, with whom he had a long relationship) before he and Ms.
Richardson fell in love as co-stars of the Roundabout Theater's
1993 production of ``Anna Christie.'' They were married in July
1994.
</P>
<P>
   She is leaving ``Cabaret'' at the same time Neeson completes his
run in ``Judas Kiss.'' Then it's back to London to finish the
``Star Wars'' film. Nobody seems to have a problem with his playing
a Jedi knight.

PANEL URGES MORE INTENSE SCIENTIFIC UFO STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine scientists from major universities and research
institutions in the US and Europe have carefully reviewed a variety
of UFO reports and concluded that no, there's no proof the reports
have anything to do with extraterrestrial intelligence, but yes,
the subject deserves far more attention from scientists than it has
had.
</P>
<P>
   The first such review by a scientific panel in 28 years, the
report, published Monday, was critical of scientists for their lack
of curiosity about a subject that has attracted such widespread
public interest, and of scientific journals for their reluctance to
publish research papers on the topic. But the report had high
praise for the French government, which for 21 years has had a
panel devoted to collecting rigorous scientific evidence related to
new sightings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever there are unexplained observations, there is the
possibility that scientists will learn something new by studying
those observations,'' the panel wrote in its report, which was
published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration.
</P>
<P>
   The journal specializes in publishing reports by legitimate
scientists on topics that are considered too controversial for many
other scientific journals.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the panel pointed out, many phenomena that are now
recognized and understood, including the fall of meteorites and the
existence of ball lightning, were known from anecdotal eyewitness
reports but were rejected by the scientific community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be valuable to carefully evaluate UFO reports to
extract information about unusual phenomena currently unknown to
science,'' the group wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, which met last fall for four days to hear various UFO
investigators present their ``best case'' evidence, focused on
reports where there was some kind of physical evidence:
photographs, radar recordings, damaged soil or plants, or physical
symptoms suffered by witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The report's conclusions were in contrast to the last major
independent review of UFO cases, conducted by Edward Condon of the
University of Colorado in 1970, which suggested there was unlikely
to be anything of value to be learned by further study.
</P>
<P>
   This panel was led by Peter Sturrock, professor emeritus of
physics at Stanford University, and included scientists from the
University of Arizona, the University of Virginia, the German
Aerospace Center and several other institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists said they were ``not convinced that any of the
evidence involved currently unknown physical processes or pointed
to the involvment of an extraterrestrial intelligence. A few cases
may have their origins in secret military activities.''
</P>
<P>
   But many cases, while intriguing, simply did not have enough
hard evidence to be able to provide a definitive explanation, they
said. They hope to spur greater efforts at scientific data
collection, and collaboration between scientists and UFO
investigators in future incidents, in hopes of being able to
pinpoint the nature of the phenomena involved.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, they cited reports of serious physical symptoms,
including some that resembled radiation sickness, and said the
medical community should be alert to the possibility of health
risks from some UFO events.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more interesting cases the panel examined, where there
were both physical evidence and trained, reliable witnesses, were
these incidents:
</P>
<P>
   _ Three hundred witnesses, most of them officers and crew aboard
two French submarines and personnel of a weather station, all
observed a 1965 incident near the Caribbean island of Martinique in
which a large luminous object arrived silently and circled the
craft twice before vanishing ``like an extinguished light bulb.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The three-member flight crew of a commercial jet flying near
Paris on January 28, 1994, saw a luminous disk they estimated to be
3,000 feet across, with fuzzy edges. The object was observed by
radar stations on the ground for 50 seconds, during which it slowed
from a speed of 110 knots to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Six employees of an Air Traffic Control Center in Switzerland
saw a large, silvery disk on June 5, 1996, rotating and wobbling.
Three separate radar systems also recorded the object.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dozens of people saw unexplained lights over a valley in
Norway called Hessdalen in the early 1980s, and less frequently
right up to the present. Some of these also produced magnetic
disturbances that were recorded by instruments.
</P>
<P>
   In cases such as that in Norway of repeated sightings from the
same location, the panel noted, ``it is difficult to understand why
no rational explanation has been discovered, and it would seem that
a small investment in equipment and time should produce useful
results.'' They recommended the development of small, automated
packages that could be set up in such places to provide continuous
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The panel concluded that ``the UFO problem is not a simple one,
and it is unlikely that there is any simple universal answer.'' But
it added that ``...there is the possibility that scientists will
learn something new by studying these observations.''

ISRAELI PRESIDENT URGES NETANYAHU TO CALL EARLY ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Dealing a stunning and unusual slap to the
government over its indecisive peace politics, President Ezer
Weizman on Monday publicly urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to call early elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The peace process is limping, and we had a few pitfalls in
recent months,'' Weizman told surprised reporters after a routine
meeting with the state comptroller. ``If I were in his place, I
would move for early elections. The sooner we go to early
elections, the sooner we'll know what the public thinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's largely ceremonial office does not give him the power
to dissolve the government or call elections, and Netanyahu
immediately responded that he had no intention of holding a new
vote until his four-year term expires in 2000. The initial reaction
among politicians and commentators was that Netanyahu would weather
this jolt, as he has so many others.
</P>
<P>
   But the unconventional action placed the outspoken president _ a
73-year-old former air force chief and defense minister who has
great popularity _ squarely in opposition to the prime minister.
The call gave new credibility and strength to the idea that if
Netanyahu is unable to make progress on the long-stalled peace with
his two-year-old coalition, he should take it to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman is notorious for stepping out of his ceremonial role to
speak his mind. Yet officials and reporters close to him said
Monday's comments were not spontaneous, but a deliberate decision
to make public his dismay and his sense that he was deceived by the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration is shared by many on both left and right _ as
well as in Washington, among the Palestinians and in Europe. Week
after week a breakthrough has appeared imminent, only to dissolve
for reasons that are never made fully public.
</P>
<P>
   The growing sense among some politicians and diplomats is that
Netanyahu is simply too unsure of the response of his Cabinet to
commit himself to ceding more West Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Party has repeatedly said it will quit
the coalition, and so bring it down, if he does so. At the other
end of the political spectrum, the Third Way party has threatened
to leave if no agreement is reached soon.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu has repeatedly insisted that progress is being made,
and has blamed the Palestinians for any and all delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am working day and night for one thing _ to bring a good
agreement, an agreement that will be based on peace and security
for Israel,'' he said Monday at a joint news conference with
visiting Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu pointedly avoided referring to Weizman by name or by
office, evidently looking to avoid a confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ``No amount of pressure, nothing, no one, will sway me from
this,'' Netanyahu said. ``For those who are interested in the
facts, I have one thing to say: Peace is very, very close. It's
very close if the Palestinians do their part.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But after more than a year of such statements, there is little
reason to believe that Netanyahu is right this time.
</P>
<P>
   After direct Israeli talks with the Palestinian Authority of
Yasser Arafat collapsed 16 months ago, the United States began
negotiating directly with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Several times in the last seven months, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright set deadlines and indirectly threatened to go
public against Netanyahu, but he has countered by mobilizing
support in the U.S. Congress and among American Jews.
</P>
<P>
   The basic outline of the package deal under discussion is for
Israel to withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank, apparently in
increments of 10 percent and 3 percent, with the pullbacks linked
to a timetable for Arafat to fulfill his obligations under the Oslo
accords, including a roundup of illegal arms, the detention of
terror suspects and another revision of the Palestinian Charter.
</P>
<P>
   According to Israeli officials, the latest problem is that
Arafat is balking at those demands, though he has said in the past
that he accepts the American proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Netanyahu offered the idea of holding a national
referendum on a withdrawal. The issue was debated furiously, then
abruptly dropped several days ago.
</P>
<P>
   Next, over the last weekend, during meetings with Aznar,
Netanyahu proposed convening a new Madrid conference, the talks
that began the current peace efforts in 1991. This idea was
immediately denounced by Arab leaders, and soon abandoned by the
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's comment was evidently prompted by his feeling that he
had been deceived by Netanyahu. Last month, when indications were
strong that a deal really was imminent, Weizman tried to drum up
support for Netanyahu in the Labor opposition and from Jordan's
King Hussein and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak _ only to find
that there was no deal. Weizman said Monday that he had not talked
to Netanyahu for four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   When talk arose about a referendum, Weizman supported the idea,
until that was dropped. ``If he isn't going to call a referendum, I
think the next solution should be elections,'' he said.

BIRD AMONG SIX NAMED TO HALL OF FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To today's beeper/cell phone/entourage set, Larry Bird may be
more identifiable as either the stoic coach of the Indiana Pacers
or the guy whose name is attached to a key provision of the
Collective Bargaining Agreement that makes a lot of players
excessively wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   He is both of those, of course, but his election to the
Basketball Hall of Fame Monday was due to his nonpareil playing
career for the Boston Celtics. It resulted in three world
championships, three MVP awards, 12 All-Star selections, a Rookie
of the Year award, and a spot on the 1992 Olympic team. His
election to the Hall was as much of a lock as a Bird free throw
down the stretch in a close game.
</P>
<P>
   Bird was one of six individuals chosen Monday. Former Harlem
Globetrotter and Magician Marques Haynes was named as was Alex
Hannum, coach of the 1957-1958 St. Louis Hawks and 1966-1967
Philadelphia 76ers, the only teams to ever defeat Bill Russell in a
playoff series. Hannum also coached the Oakland Oaks to an ABA
title and told the AP he was in ``utter and complete shock'' after
hearing of his selection. ``I think it's a tremendous honor and
it's something you can only dream about,'' Hannum added.
</P>
<P>
   Arnie Risen, who spent the last three years of his 13-year
career with the Celtics (1955-58), Jody Conradt, the coach of the
University of Texas women's team, and ex-Yugoslavian coach
Aleksandar Nikolic. In addition, Lenny Wilkens joined John Wooden
as the only two-time inductees last week. Wilkens was honored as a
coach, having already been selected as a player.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first year Bird was eligible, having been out of
basketball for the minimum five years. While the Hall does not
release vote tallies, its public relations director, Robin Deutsch,
said he'd be ``surprised'' if the 24 voters did not all include
Bird on their ballots. In recent elections, both Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar and Julius Erving were both first-time inductees as
well as unanimous selections.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 24 voting members are 10 members of the media (a 5/5
split among professional and college writers), and 14 who really
know something about basketball. The voters are rotated, sometimes
on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   Bird released a statement Monday which sounded a lot like it
came from the file cabinet folder marked `Grateful Acceptance
Speech.'' He thanked his family, his friends, his fans, his coaches
at high school, college, and the pro level, and basically everyone
but Marc Iavaroni.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, it's a great honor,'' the statement said. He
said all those who helped him along the way should share in the
award, ``because, like the other awards I received, this is as much
a team accomplishment as an individual accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird presumably will have other basketball bonbons to disperse
this afternoon at a news conference at Market Square Arena in
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Bird has been out of the NBA since 1992, when a bad back forced
him to retire at age 35. He spent five restless seasons working for
the Celtics as a consultant, but never felt he was being heard. He
eagerly returned to the NBA last year as the coach, future general
manager, and part-owner of the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   His name also is held in vain by most owners because of the
so-called ``Larry Bird Exception,'' which is at the heart of the
impending lockout. When the NBA instituted the cap in 1983, it
wanted a device that enabled teams to exceed the cap to re-sign its
own players. Bird's contract was up and it was deemed by everyone
to be a good thing for the Celtics to keep him in Boston. Thus was
born the Larry Bird Exception.
</P>
<P>
   As is always the case, there were some deserving nominees who
did not get selected. Among those were former coach and player
Larry Costello, Adrian Dantley, Sidney Moncrief, Chet Walker, Artis
Gilmore, and Gus Johnson. Coaches who fell short included
Georgetown's John Thompson and Bulls assistant Tex Winter,
architect of the triple-post offense as well as a longtime college
coach. Former Wayland Baptist coach Harley Redin (women's
category), shoe company executive Grady Lewis (veterans), and
Ubiratan Pereira Maciel of Brazil (international) also were not
selected.

HOLLAND EDGES YUGOSLAVIA, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOULOUSE, France _ Two years ago, Edgar Davids hailed a taxi in
the England countryside and left the Holland national team amid
accusations of racism.
</P>
<P>
   He did not return until last month, after peace talks with coach
Guus Hiddink, and after an impressive season with Juventus in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Davids' comeback had been quiet _ he was boycotting the media _
before last night, when he launched the winning goal in the last
minute of Holland's 2-1 win over Yugoslavia. The Dutch will meet
either Argentina or England in the quarterfinals in Marseille
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the goal, Davids, nicknamed ``Pit Bull,'' had stifled
Yugoslavia's creative midfielders, except for the period at the
start of the second half, when the Yugoslavs nearly took the lead.
In fact, had Pedrag Mijatovic not missed a penalty, the Yugoslavs
might have won. But after Mijatovic's shot bounced away, the Dutch
regained the momentum and deserved the victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch team has been divided into two camps _ young players
such as Davids and Clarence Seedorf, of Surinamese descent, and the
veterans whose families have been in the Low Countries for ages.
They had blended well, especially in the '80s with Ruud Gullitt and
Frank Rijkaard, but the new generation has had clashes which
culminated in a disastrous 4-1 loss to England in the 1996 European
Championships.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions were already high for this match, as Yugoslavia was
making its first appearance in an international tournament since UN
sanctions had banned it for 33 months, and they were inflamed by a
proposal from a deputy in Holland's Socialist party that the Dutch
players turn their backs while the Yugoslavian national anthem was
played to protest Belgrade's policies in Kosovo. Miljan Miljanic,
president of the Yugoslav football federation, made a formal
protest. The Dutch Minister of Sport, Erica Terpstra, boycotted the
match, and the ruling Labor party urged Dutch fans to turn their
backs.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, conflicts started in a section of Yugoslavs, and
riot police entered.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the attention was focused on the field, as two of
the most explosive, highly-skilled teams battled. The Dutch,
though, were the more proactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the feeling we couldn't lose,'' striker Dennis Bergkamp
said. ``We were the stronger team. But I hope we can do better than
we did before if we play England.''
</P>
<P>
   They controlled midfield and pressured Yugoslavia into mistakes.
The Yugoslavs simply backed off into a defensive shell and launched
some speculative long balls toward Mijatovic in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Bergkamp finally converted the first goal, the indirect result
of the constant pressure. After several close calls following
intricate buildups, Bergkamp converted a simple, long clearance, by
holding off defender Zoran Mirkovic, controlling the ball with the
outside of his right foot, and drilling a low shot which glanced
off the hands of 6-foot-6-inch Ivica Kralj in the 38th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bergkamp's goal was mostly the result of the goalkeeper's
error, Holland had several near-misses. By the 16th minute, the
Yugoslavs appeared on the verge of panic as Slobodan Komljenovic
headed away for a corner _ after the Dutch had backed off and given
up on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Holland's became more confident, and increased its attacks.
Apparently, they had become overconfident, traditionally a bad
habit for the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it drives me crazy because this team can play so
well,'' Hiddink said.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia changed its tactics at the start of the second half.
Dragan Stojkovic livened up the midfield, despite the close pursuit
of Davids.
</P>
<P>
   A Stojkovic advance led to a throw-in, and Mijatovic was tripped
by Michael Reiziger on the left edge of hte penalty area. Stojkovic
curled the free kick to the far post, where Slobodan Komljenovic
headed to tie in the third minute of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Two minutes later, Yugoslavia penetrated again, and Vladimir
Jugovic's shirt was pulled by Jaap Stam. Jugovic's strength
rendered the pull inocuous, but referee Jose Garcia-Aranda called a
penalty. Goalkeeper Edwin Van Der Sar dove to his right as
Mijatovic smashed the penalty into the underside of the crossbar.
The Dutch countered quickly, and Bergkamp and Mihailjovic collided
in the right corner.
</P>
<P>
   Dejan (Il Genio _ The Genius) Savicevic replaced Stojkovic early
in the half, but could not share his ideas as the Dutch played
keepaway.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia retreated to play for overtime, and the Dutch
capitalized. Marc Overmars lined up two shots in the 45th minute,
both resulting in corner kicks. Then, Davids was left unmarked just
outside the penalty arc on the left, and he sent a low shot into
the right corner.
</P>
<P>
   Had the match gone into overtime, Davids would have been
benched, according to Hiddink.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest I was planning some things in extra time,''
Hiddink said. ``Edgar Davids had lost his muscle in the last six or
seven minutes, and I was preparing a subsitution. It was a happy
non-decision to let him go to the end.''

   WENATCHEE-VERDICT (Seattle) A jury acquitted the defendants of
any liability Monday in a lawsuit stemming from the Wenatchee child
sex rings investigation.

<P>
   After deliberating for more than five days, the jury decided
that Wenatchee, the town's police officials and three members of
the Douglas County sheriff's department did not violate the civil
rights of four people who say they were falsely accused of child
rape and molestation in the 1994-95 investigations.

   SALMON-AGREEMENT (Undated) A salmon conservation agreement
announced Friday is ``inequitable'' and will be ``devastating for
British Columbia fishermen,'' British Columbia Premier Glen Clark
said Monday. Clark was cut out of the agreement, which was
negotiated between Canada's federal fisheries ministry and
Washington Gov. Gary Locke. ``Canada is not ready to stand up to
the United States on this issue, so they cobble together a stop-gap
deal, and claim victory for what is really a defeat,'' Clark said
in an interview. The premier hinted that British Columbia will
again try legal action in American courts, and may ``reconsider''
costly salmon conservation measures if they only produce fish for
Americans to catch. Clark's charges were dismissed by Fisheries
Minister David Anderson, who argued that Canada and Washington have
taken long overdue, urgently needed measures to save imperiled
salmon stocks on both sides of the border. ``We don't want to get
mixed up in this,'' said Locke's fisheries adviser Curt Smitch.

GENE MAY NOT EXTEND LIFE OF NON-HISPANIC WHITES WITH AIDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DON FINLEY  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A gene mutation previously found to extend the
life and health of HIV-infected people appears only to work in
African Americans and perhaps Hispanics, but not non-Hispanic
whites, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the study _ which examined 1,090 HIV-infected Air
Force personnel _ found that another gene mutation earlier believed
to delay disease progression actually caused patients to sicken and
die faster.
</P>
<P>
   The findings, appearing Tuesday in the journal Nature Medicine,
suggest that developing treatments around the relatively new
science of genetic resistance to AIDS may be more difficult than
many had hoped, said Dr. Sunil Ahuja, assistant professor of
medicine at the University of Texas Health Science Center in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though non-Hispanic whites and African Americans have the
same gene mutation, it's only protective in one group,'' Ahuja
said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the findings suggest that other, yet-undiscovered
gene mutations are also at work in one group but not the other.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, it was known that the virus that causes AIDS
latches onto a receptor called CD4 to enter and infect immune
cells.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, researchers confirmed the virus also locks onto a
second site, or co-receptor. That co-receptor varies depending on
the stage of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the infection, the virus latches onto a receptor called
CCR5. A mutation in both copies of the CCR5 gene _ found in 1
percent of non-Hispanic whites, but rare in other groups _ makes
people resistant to becoming infected in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   As the disease runs its course, it binds to other receptors.
Mutations in those receptors have been linked in earlier studies to
longer, disease-free lives among people infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus.
</P>
<P>
   One is the CCR2 receptor. The San Antonio researchers found the
mutated CCR2 twice as often in African Americans, Hispanics and
American Indians than in non-Hispanic whites.
</P>
<P>
   But even in those non-Hispanic whites who have CCR2, there was
no delay in disease progression. A significant delay was found in
African Americans, and Ahuja said some effect was seen in
Hispanics, but there was too little to make a statistical
comparison.
</P>
<P>
   In January, researchers with the National Cancer Institute
announced a protective effect linked to people with mutations in
the gene SDF1. That gene was associated with a seven- to 10-year
delay in the onset of AIDS from infection.
</P>
<P>
   But the San Antonio study found those with the SDF1 mutation in
the study group actually died three years sooner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why there's this discrepancy in the reports from our group and
the previous group aren't clear,'' Ahuja said. ``We repeated this
analysis several times and we feel confident in our data.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ahuja, the researchers include his wife, Dr.
Seema Ahuja, also an assistant professor of medicine at the health
science center; and Air Force Lt. Col. M.J. Dolan with the
infectious diseases service at Wilford Hall Medical Center.

TRIPP SET TO FACE GRAND JURY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House aides, lawyers, and political spinners
have all had their chance to discuss the alleged sexual
relationship between President Clinton and a White House intern.
Tuesday morning Linda Tripp, who touched off the scandal, gets her
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after going to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr with
homemade tape recordings of conversations with Monica S. Lewinsky,
Tripp finally will testify before his federal grand jury. Tripp, a
Pentagon employee, is expected to discuss why she secretly taped
her friend and what she learned from their frequent talks about the
former White House intern's alleged sexual relationship with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty to tell, said Lucianne Goldberg, a literary agent
and conservative activist who in 1996 tried to get Tripp to write a
book about White House scandals. ``Only half of it is the tapes,''
Goldberg said in an interview Monday. ``You have to realize that
Linda Tripp was working in the White House when the Clintons moved
in, so she has other things to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what more Tripp could reveal, Goldberg would say only
``things, people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tripp's critics at the White House and elsewhere have
questioned her motivation, saying she pretended to be a confidante
while prodding Lewinsky to make statements damaging to the
president. They also question whether she and Goldberg were trying
to cash in on controversies involving Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This much is clear: the rumors, political bickering, and legal
skirmishes prompted by Tripp have not subsided. In a marble-lined
federal appeals court Monday, Clinton's lawyers squared off with
Starr over whether the president can invoke attorney-client
privilege to shield one of his aides from questioning in the
Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's team of prosecutors is investigating whether Clinton and
Lewinsky, who both gave sworn testimony in the Paula Jones's sexual
harassment case against the president, lied under oath when they
denied having a sexual relationship. Starr is also trying to
determine if Clinton and his top aides tampered with witnesses and
obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   Starr told the three-judge panel that Bruce Lindsey, the
president's adviser and lawyer, must be compelled to testify about
his discussed it with Clinton. Unlike a private lawyer, a
government lawyer represents not just an individual but an
institution, Starr said. The grand jury in the Lewinsky
investigation must have all ``relevant'' information that deputy
White House counsel Lindsey gathered in his discussions with
Clinton and others, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr compared Clinton to a chief executive officer who seeks
advice about a legal problem from one of his company's lawyers. The
lawyer has a responsibility to the company, not just the CEO, Starr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Neil Eggleston, representing the White House, said
Starr has no grounds for seeking information about discussions that
Clinton, Lindsey and the president's private lawyers held about how
to deal with the Lewinsky investigation. A president who cannot be
assured of privacy in his talks with lawywers would effectively be
``completely and irrevocably deprived'' of legal advice, Eggleston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, the Justice Department disagreed with both
Clinton and Starr. The department, taking a middle path, urged that
the case between returned the district court with instructions that
evidence should be surrendered to the grand jury only if it is
deemed ``essential to ... justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal district court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson has already
backed Starr. Monday's arguments were filled with hypothetical
discussions about a president facing impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time ever a president has asserted executive
privilege in response to a grand jury subpoena,'' said Appeals
Court J. Raymond Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the woman who was the original trigger for these
debates remained silent Monday. Tripp has remained at her
$88,200-a-year public relations job at the Pentagon, though she
works from a secret location.
</P>
<P>
   Back before she sought out Starr, Tripp was one of the many
civil servants who work in near-anonymity in Washington. Now she
has two lawyers, a spokesman, a team of volunteers raising money
for her legal fund, a web site and even a bumper sticker issued by
her fans. Desperate for any scrap of information, reporters have
even interviewed neighbors in suburban Virginia about Tripp's
dog-walking habits.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp is expected to appear before the grand jury for three
days. For all the media furor, she remains enigmatic. She has said
little about her motives for going to Starr. Indeed, she has not
spoken in public since making a brief statement on Jan. 21, after
the allegations of the Lewinsky liaison first broke and existence
of the 20 hours of tapes was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   It was also revealed that Tripp had met Lewinsky in a hotel in
January and, at Starr's request, made secret tapes of their
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said there is no mystery to Tripp's behavior. Tripp,
she said, was angered by a list of ``talking points'' that she
received from Lewinsky, which suggested possible answers they could
give in testimony that would help Clinton in the Jones's case. The
author of the list has not been revealed, but Tripp's supporters
suggest a Clinton aide drew it up for Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was being asked to commit perjury by the most powerful man
in the world, through his surrogates, and she didn't want to do
it,'' Goldberg said.

POLITICS LARGELY OVER, CLINTON IN SHANGHAI TO SEE CHINA'S FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-DAY, CHINA-BOEING, CHINA-TV-COVERAGE,
CHINA-PEONY) 
(th) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ With the heavily political, issue-laden leg of
his China trip now behind him, President Clinton and his entourage
came to the nation's largest and most cosmopolitan city Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   To put his finger on the vibrant pulse of modern China, his
aides said, Clinton will spend two days and three nights here
talking to regular people.
</P>
<P>
   Driving down the winding avenues of neon that advertise a
distinctly commercial sensibility in this city, Clinton's motorcade
went directly from the airport to Shanghai's thriving waterfront,
the visual climax of any tour of this megacity of 14 million.
</P>
<P>
   On one side of a dark and brooding river, a long row of stately,
colonial bank buildings were vividly lighted as if in celebration
of Shanghai's swanky past. Across the river, in a newly-developing
area known as Pudong, a crowd of shiny new skyscrapers seemed to
play to this city's boast of being the future of China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is scheduled to meet entrepreneurs, community leaders
and home-owners in Shanghai, to try to accentuate the dynamic,
fast-growing economic side of China. And to address ordinary
Chinese people, as he did by speaking on live television in
Beijing, Clinton will also host a live radio call-in show that his
Chinese hosts have promised not to censor.
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped out of his limousine at the Portman Ritz-Carlton
Hotel, located on a busy street in downtown Shanghai that was lined
with crowds of people craning their necks for a glimpse of him,
Clinton waved to acknowledge the roar of cheering that greeted him.
</P>
<P>
   Then he went inside for the evening, passing up the chance to
peek at Shanghai's boisterous nightlife at any of the bars and
supper clubs that self-consciously fashion themselves after the
styles set in the 1920s and '30s, when Shanghai was the most
cosmopolitan city in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   On Clinton's daytime itinerary in Shanghai are three landmarks
that, in an indication of how this city is coming alive, have
opened in just the past two years: a technologically advanced stock
exchange, a world-class museum with inventive display techniques
and the nation's most modern and accessible public library.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides have portrayed his itinerary as one that traces
China's history. In Xian, the first stop, one sees relics of
ancient China. In Beijing the largest icons of Communist China are
on view. And Shanghai is clearly the most forward-looking city in
the country. Of course, that neat description does not account for
Guilin, the pleasure spot, or Hong Kong, which both lie ahead on
the presidential travel plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Shanghai is the future of China,'' said Mike
McCurry, the White House spokesman. ``The changes that are taking
place in China are reflected in the very dynamic growth,
economically, and the changes taking place in South China.''
</P>
<P>
   To Shanghai residents, actually, the rate of economic growth is
palpably slowing. The real estate boom of the mid-1990s has now
created a bubble of supply that seems poised to burst, but has not
done so yet.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison with much of the rest of Asia, however, Shanghai
looks healthy. Round-the-clock construction continues on
skyscrapers throughout the city, if on fewer than before. The
unemployment rate is rising steadily, as state-owned factories
downsize, yet average family income is still climbing marginally.
</P>
<P>
   There are relatively few formal events planned during Clinton's
stay here, and officials doing advance planning work say that
offers the Clinton family the flexibility for shopping and walks,
or quiet time away from their 1,000-member entourage.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's itinerary includes only three events, leaving almost
the entire afternoon free for shopping or something unscripted.
Wednesday's plans are almost as relaxed. On Monday, after speaking
at Beijing University, Clinton and his family took it easy. They
stayed in, at Diaoyutai Guest House, playing cards and board games,
McCurry said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton also has a modest handful of visits
planned in Shanghai. To combine her long-standing interest in
health care and the welfare of children, Mrs. Clinton is scheduled
to visit the Shanghai Children's Medical Center, a new hospital
that was built by Project Hope, a U.S.-based foundation, and
Shanghai's Second Medical University.
</P>
<P>
   It is the first hospital in China devoted to treating children,
and it was created by nongovernment entities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not in any five-year plan,'' said William Walsh,
president and chief executive of Project Hope, which has been
active in China since 1983, training and advising medical personnel
about public health. ``It reflects the kind of volunteerism that is
starting to grow in China today.''
</P>
<P>
   And it also has helped, Walsh said, that two of Shanghai's
former leaders who welcomed Project Hope to the city were later
promoted to the country's top positions: President Jiang Zemin and
Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is also planning to visit a women's education and
training center, and the Shanghai No. 3 Girl's School. On
Wednesday, she will visit the Ohel Rachel Synagogue, a place of
worship for Jews who lived in Shanghai before the Communist-led
army arrived in 1949, inducing most foreigners to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is expected to join her husband at a roundtable
discussion on Tuesday morning at the Shanghai Library, titled
``Shaping China for the 21st Century,'' which is expected to
highlight the way an information-driven age will affect all
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the world we live in, this global information age, constant
improvement and change is necessary to economic opportunity and to
national strength,'' Clinton said Monday at Beijing University.
``Therefore, the freest possible flow of information, ideas and
opinions, and a greater respect for divergent political and
religious convictions will actually breed strength and stability
going forward.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Expensive anti-AIDS drugs for pregnant women now being made
available to developing countries
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geneva _ Thousands of unborn babies in the Third World soon will
have a better chance at dodging AIDS, because of a new program that
will make expensive anti-HIV drugs available to HIV-positive
pregnant women in some developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the
World Health Organization announced Monday at the 12th World AIDS
Conference that it plans to launch pilot drug therapy programs in
several developing countries where mother-to-child HIV transmission
is a serious problem. One in three babies born to women with HIV
contract the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or birth, or
through breast-feeding, according to the WHO.
</P>
<P>
   Through this initiative, about 30,000 HIV-infected women in
about 30 different locations will receive treatment with AZT
(zidovudine), for about a month during late pregnancy and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save the life of a child costs $50,'' said Bernard
Kouchner, France's health minister. ``The effort, of course, must
be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the per-person cost of AZT treatment for this program
nor the program's total cost has been determined, said Peter Young,
vice-president of Glaxo Wellcome, which manufactures AZT.
</P>
<P>
   But $50 per person is the estimate used by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Monday the CDC presented
the results of a study in Bangkok, Thailand,that found AZT cut the
risk of mother-to-child infection by half, when given to
HIV-positive women in the last weeks of pregnancy. ``The challenge
now is how to translate these findings into practice,'' said Dr.
Nathan Shaffer of the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   The standard course of treatment for HIV-positive pregnant women
in industrialized countries is longer and more complex than the
regimen used in the Bangkok study. It is also more effective,
reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The chances are even better for babies born to mothers who not
only receive this higher standard of anti-viral therapy but also
opt to deliver via elective Caesarian section performed before
labor begins. Research has shown that infants can be infected with
HIV during labor contractions as well as when they pass through the
birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Denison, an HIV-positive American who gave birth to
twins two years ago, credits this treatment with keeping her
children free of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely a result of the access to care I have
in the United States,'' said Denison.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, nearly 600,000 infants were not as fortunate as
Denison's twins. The longer drug regimen costs $600-$800. In
countries such as Tanzania, where the annual health care
expenditure per person is $4, this form of treatment is out of
reach.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to receiving AZT therapy, the women who are selected
for the UNAIDS/WHO program will receive prenatal counseling and
treatment, better care during labor and delivery and support in the
form of infant formula if they opt not to breast-feed their
infants.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participating nations: Botswana, Burkina, Cambodia,
Faso, Honduras, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   The UNAIDS/WHO program highlights the enormous disparity between
treatment and prevention efforts in developing and developed
countries, AIDS experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Many have asked what will happen to the HIV-positive mothers who
participate in this and other similar programs once their drug
therapy ends.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they do not expect the mothers to develop
resistance to AZT after ending a short course. But they shy away
from directly answering questions about the possible fate of these
women. As they know, drastic improvements in economy, health care
and the basic quality of life must occur for the face of AIDS to
change in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pregnancy lasts nine months,'' Denison said. ``But motherhood
lasts the rest of their lives.''

 &HT;    Expensive anti-AIDS drugs for pregnant women now being made
available to developing countries
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geneva _ Thousands of unborn babies in the Third World soon will
have a better chance at dodging AIDS, because of a new program that
will make expensive anti-HIV drugs available to HIV-positive
pregnant women in some developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) and the
World Health Organization announced Monday at the 12th World AIDS
Conference that it plans to launch pilot drug therapy programs in
several developing countries where mother-to-child HIV transmission
is a serious problem. One in three babies born to women with HIV
contract the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or birth, or
through breast-feeding, according to the WHO.
</P>
<P>
   Through this initiative, about 30,000 HIV-infected women in
about 30 different locations will receive treatment with AZT
(zidovudine), for about a month during late pregnancy and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save the life of a child costs $50,'' said Bernard
Kouchner, France's health minister. ``The effort, of course, must
be implemented.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the per-person cost of AZT treatment for this program
nor the program's total cost has been determined, said Peter Young,
vice-president of Glaxo Wellcome, which manufactures AZT.
</P>
<P>
   But $50 per person is the estimate used by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. Monday the CDC presented
the results of a study in Bangkok, Thailand,that found AZT cut the
risk of mother-to-child infection by half, when given to
HIV-positive women in the last weeks of pregnancy. ``The challenge
now is how to translate these findings into practice,'' said Dr.
Nathan Shaffer of the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   The standard course of treatment for HIV-positive pregnant women
in industrialized countries is longer and more complex than the
regimen used in the Bangkok study. It is also more effective,
reducing mother-to-child transmission of HIV by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The chances are even better for babies born to mothers who not
only receive this higher standard of anti-viral therapy but also
opt to deliver via elective Caesarian section performed before
labor begins. Research has shown that infants can be infected with
HIV during labor contractions as well as when they pass through the
birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Denison, an HIV-positive American who gave birth to
twins two years ago, credits this treatment with keeping her
children free of HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's absolutely a result of the access to care I have
in the United States,'' said Denison.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, nearly 600,000 infants were not as fortunate as
Denison's twins. The longer drug regimen costs $600-$800. In
countries such as Tanzania, where the annual health care
expenditure per person is $4, this form of treatment is out of
reach.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to receiving AZT therapy, the women who are selected
for the UNAIDS/WHO program will receive prenatal counseling and
treatment, better care during labor and delivery and support in the
form of infant formula if they opt not to breast-feed their
infants.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participating nations: Botswana, Burkina, Cambodia,
Faso, Honduras, Rwanda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   The UNAIDS/WHO program highlights the enormous disparity between
treatment and prevention efforts in developing and developed
countries, AIDS experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Many have asked what will happen to the HIV-positive mothers who
participate in this and other similar programs once their drug
therapy ends.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers say they do not expect the mothers to develop
resistance to AZT after ending a short course. But they shy away
from directly answering questions about the possible fate of these
women. As they know, drastic improvements in economy, health care
and the basic quality of life must occur for the face of AIDS to
change in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pregnancy lasts nine months,'' Denison said. ``But motherhood
lasts the rest of their lives.''

 &HT;    Conference discusses making AIDS drugs easier to take
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geneva _ It may take a decade or more to determine if the most
potent AIDS drugs now available can eradicate the virus from the
body, one of the world's top AIDS researchers said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the 12th World AIDS Conference, Dr. David Ho said
understanding how HIV hides from drugs within the body in
``reservoirs,'' such as brain cells, is a major hurdle to curing
the disease. ``This is the major documented obstacle to virus
eradication,'' said Ho, of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center
in New York. ``The task ahead is to try to understand this
reservoir.''
</P>
<P>
   Ho suggested that it may not be necessary to completely
eliminate the virus, but to reduce it to a point at which a
patient's immune system could keep the virus in check, without
assistance from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Until a more effective treatment is discovered, patients must
continue taking their current drug regimens, typically involving
dozens of pills a day, said Ho. A challenge for researchers is to
make it easier for patients to adhere to these drug regimens, or
HIV will swiftly develop resistance to them.
</P>
<P>
   Ho and other scientists spoke about advances and challenges in
anti-HIV drug therapy at a conference symposium Monday. While the
researchers emphasized how much progress has been made in the last
few years, they also stressed that no new drug advances shine as
brightly as did protease inhibitors, the most effective class of
drugs available, when they were first introduced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single magic bullet . . . doesn't exist,'' said Dr. Joep
Lange of the University of Amsterdam. ``It's biologically
impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   But making drugs at least easier to take is important for
patients to follow dose regimens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Therapy must go toward once-a-day (drugs),'' said Dr. Julio
Montaner of the University of British Columbia. ``It's not whether
we like it or not, that's the direction we have to go in if we want
patients to benefit over a long-term basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Efavirenz, also known as Sustiva, is a once-daily
investigational drug that has shown excellent results in
large-scale tests, DuPont Pharmaceuticals announced Monday. But the
best results are from combinations of efavirenz with other
anti-viral drugs, such as AZT and Crixivan, which must be taken two
or three times per day.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont applied this month for efavirenz to be approved by the U.
S. Food and Drug Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Murphy of Northwestern University, who spoke at
Monday's symposium about numerous combinations of drugs, said the
dozen or so drugs now in the testing pipeline will offer patients
and doctors many more options for treatment. But for those for whom
the existing options don't work, time is running short.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things do look encouraging, but these things are pretty far
away,'' Murphy said.

 &HT;    COLUMN:Finding closed-end funds
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the stock market gets this high and unruly, a lot of people
want to shop for bargains.
</P>
<P>
   That sometimes brings to mind closed-end mutual funds,
particularly the ones that trade at a discount to the true value of
the stocks they hold.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, closed-end funds can be a bargain. But they aren't for
everyone and all occasions. If they were, more people would be
actively selling them, and more people would be buying them.
</P>
<P>
   Not that the field is dormant. As the chart shows, total
investment in closed-end funds between 1991 and 1998 has grown
every year but one, registering a decline in 1994. Still, the funds
have only a small fraction of the $5.05 trillion invested in all
mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   A closed-end fund is a special critter. Like the regular,
open-end funds, the closed-end ones are portfolios of stocks or
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But there are differences. You buy shares in a regular fund
directly from the fund, at a price that is always pegged to the net
asset value of the stocks it owns. By contrast, a closed-end fund
issues a set number of shares, which then trade on the exchanges,
like stocks.
</P>
<P>
   That means in periods of high demand, closed-end funds may sell
for a premium _ more than the value of the stocks they own. But
more often than not, they trade at a discount, meaning you get the
underlying shares for less than their face value. That's what
brings out the bargain hunters.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, you get more securities for your buck. That's
particularly attractive for bond investors. If you buy at a lower
price, yield automatically goes up.
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction is the possibility that your fund could move
back into favor. ``If it performs well, you could make even more
money, because you get the extra kick from the narrowing
discount,'' pointed out Gregg Wolper, the closed-end fund editor
for Morningstar Inc.
</P>
<P>
   If the market tanks, on the other hand, you get a certain kind
of stability by owning a closed-end fund. Its price will presumably
go down, of course. But a closed-end manager doesn't have to do
what open-end managers are sometimes compelled to do _ sell stocks
in a panic if a lot of shareholders want out.
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction, however, is the discount. A warning comes
with it: Today's 8 percent discount, compelling as it may be, could
go to 10 percent or 12 percent tomorrow, if the fund goes out of
favor. As with any other investment, there may be a very good
reason why the fund was out of favor to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Some very bright people warn against closed-end funds if you
want a general-purpose stock fund. ``Among diversified equity
funds, prefer open-end over closed-end,'' writes Sheldon Jacobs in
his ``Guide to Successful No-Load Fund Investing.''
</P>
<P>
   His reasoning is this: ``As a generality, we believe the
open-end funds have more aggressive management, since they can be
penalized for poor performance. The managers of closed-end funds
know that their funds can't be redeemed.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolper agrees, especially among large-cap stocks. ``Closed-end
funds are beneficial for areas that are more volatile or less
liquid,'' he said. They could include funds that invest only in one
country's stocks, or only in narrow industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that general warning, a diversified U.S. stock fund was
the first he mentioned on a short list of closed-end funds worth a
look:
</P>
<P>
   -- Central Securities, which invests in midsize U.S. companies,
``has a tremendous record over a long period,'' Wolper said. At the
end of May, Morningstar gave it five stars, the top risk-vs.-return
rating. It had a five-year annualized return of 23.7 percent, based
on net asset value, and a discount of 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Europe Fund, which Wolper said matches its peers over
time. It had five stars, a five-year return of 26.8 percent and a
discount of 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, one of several run by
the widely admired Mark Mobius. Its numbers were not as high,
however: Four stars, a five-year return of 11.5 percent and a
premium _ rather than a discount _ of 4 percent.

COMPAQ BEGINS TRIMDOWN IN WAKE OF DIGITAL ACQUISITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Compaq Computer Corp., which completed its $9.5 billion
acquisition of Digital earlier this month, Monday said it will lay
off 5,000 manufacturing workers worldwide and close eight plants
and distribution centers.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first part of a previously announced massive
restructuring that will eventually claim 17,000 jobs, including
15,000 Digital workers.
</P>
<P>
   The restructuring will leave Compaq with a total of 67,000
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the shake up is about much more than Compaq's effort to
absorb Digital. It's also part of a year-old plan to completely
overhaul the way Compaq makes computers _ an effort to keep up with
one of the industry's most successful companies, Round Rock,
Texas-based Dell Computer Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The single biggest job cut &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; 1,000 workers &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; comes at
Compaq's manufacturing facility in Houston. Compaq will cease
production of printed circuit boards for computers &UR;  &LR; and some
consumer products. The company will also reorganize its Houston
warehousing and distribution operations.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the overhaul of US manufacturing operations, Compaq
began laying off 600 administrative workers at the Marlborough,
Mass., facility that formerly served as headquarters for Digital's
manufacturing operations.
</P>
<P>
   Another 3,400 jobs will disappear as Compaq closes facilities
worldwide, or merges them with Digital facilities. Digital's
operations in Taiwan will be phased out. Digital &UR;  &LR; operations in
Australia, Scotland, Brazil and Singapore will be closed, with
operations moved to Compaq sites in those countries. In Japan,
Compaq will consolidate operations at a former Digital center which
assembles computers for delivery.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shannon, publisher of a newsletter on Digital, notes that
Massachusetts got off lightly in this round of layoffs beecause of
the focus on manufacturing. ``There's precious little of it in this
state,'' he said. ``It could be an awful lot worse.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Digital's workers in Massachusetts are concentrated in sales,
customer service and hardware and software engineering, as well as
corporate administration.
</P>
<P>
   But there are many more cuts still to come. Greg Petsch,
Compaq's senior vice president for manufacturing, said that further
layoffs were being planned in staffing for specific product lines,
the company's sales organization, and in corporate administration.
</P>
<P>
   Along with helping Compaq to absorb its Digital acquisition, the
changes are part of the company's year-old plan to adopt more
efficient methods of getting computers to customers. Compaq was the
darling of the computer industry last year, but has stumbled in
recent months. The company manufactured computers faster than its
distributors could sell them. That led to slower orders for new
machines and forced drastic price cuts that have weakened profit
margins throughout the industry.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of 1998, Compaq reported profits of $16
million, down from $414 million a year earlier. And the company
predicts that it will just break even this quarter. Meanwhile,
cross-state rival Dell Computer has seen its earnings grow
steadily. In its first quarter ended in April, Dell earned $305
million, up 54 percent from the year before. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Dell sells virtually all its computers by telephone or over the
Internet, assembling them only after an order is received. This
dramatically reduces the company's costs, leading to stronger
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Now Compaq is trying to embrace a similar model. The company has
launched an Internet site to sell directly to consumers. It's
cutting back on production &UR;  &LR; of some electronic components, opting
to buy them instead. At the same time, it's trying to keep good
relations with its traditional distribution channels that bring in
most of Compaq's revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very delicate balance,'' said Roger Kay, an analyst
with International Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass. ``They have to
maintain their channel balance because they can't withstand the
hiccup in revenue ... At the same time, they have to get their cost
model in line with Dell's.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq stock closed up 3/8 at 29 5/16 on the New York Stock
Exchange. &UR;  &LR;

end of May, Morningstar gave it five stars, the top risk-vs.-return
rating. It had a five-year annualized return of 23.7 percent, based
on net asset value, and a discount of 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Europe Fund, which Wolper said matches its peers over
time. It had five stars, a five-year return of 26.8 percent and a
discount of 9.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, one of several run by
the widely admired Mark Mobius. Its numbers were not as high,
however: Four stars, a five-year return of 11.5 percent and a
premium _ rather than a discount _ of 4 percent.

 &HT;    Time puts faces on disparate group of gun owners
 &HT;    By Don O'Braint
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated 30 years ago, Congress
reacted by passing an act that banned most interstate sales of guns
and outlawed ownership by felons, minors and the mentally ill.
Today, Time ($2.95) reports, America is still under the gun. A
haunting photo essay by British photographer Zed Nelson portrays
born-again Christians, female executives, housewives and doctors,
all armed and ready to defend themselves. The most troubling
photograph shows a young Dallas father holding his infant daughter
in one hand and a pistol in the other. In a companion article,
writer Margot Hornblower interviews Charlton Heston about his plans
to revive the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   Life ($3.95) addresses the same subject with a twist. The
magazine visits nine heroic teenagers who helped disarm Kipland
Kinkel when he opened fire at Thurston High School in Springfield,
Ore. Says Josh Ryker: ``I don't feel like a hero _ it still hasn't
hit me that I saved a lot of people.'' Now the people of
Springfield are trying to figure out how to make such heroism
unnecessary ever again. On a lighter note, Life presents exclusive
photos of Maya Angelou's 70th birthday bash on a Caribbean cruise
with Oprah Winfrey, Coretta Scott King and Quincy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ALL IN THE FAMILY: Violence can occur even when no guns are
involved. In a compelling cover story, Mother Jones ($3.95)
explores domestic violence and its toll on children. Kids act out
what they see, writes Claudia Glenn Dowling, a senior editor at
Life magazine who spent a year following a Vermont family in a
study of violence. ``Opposite-sex siblings tend to be at more risk
to act out exactly what their parents do,'' psychologist Carla
Garrity says. ``Girls align with the victim, boys align with the
aggressor.'' And, in a terrifying statistic, Garrity predicts that
half of the 3 million children who live in violent homes will
become violent adults.
</P>
<P>
   SEX AT THE TOP: Some say that if Bill Clinton were the head of a
corporation he would have been fired because of alleged sexual
misconduct. That's not necessarily so, says U.S. News &AMP; World
Report ($2.95) in an article on Milan Panic. As CEO of ICN
Pharmaceuticals, Panic (pronounced PAH-neesh) has tripled the
company's value in the past year. The 68-year-old father of five
also has been involved in four sexual harassment cases. The women
claim Panic repeatedly propositioned them or groped them and
rewarded or punished female employees based on their responses. The
ICN board of directors responded not by kicking him out, but by
sweetening his $644,680 salary with a $1.8 million bonus. And, in
its continuing coverage of the Monica Lewinsky case, the magazine
explains why race may be a hidden factor. Lewinsky's attorneys seem
to be betting that she could win a jury trial in the largely
African-American and Democratic District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   WAR STORIES: Steven Spielberg's war epic ``Saving Private Ryan''
is so realistic that during a screening, historian Stephen E.
Ambrose asked the projectionist to stop the film until he could
compose himself after seeing the combat scenes at Omaha Beach. One
of the reasons the film is so moving, reports US ($3), is that it
is inspired by real people and their sacrifices. Spielberg based
his film on the story of the four Niland brothers of Tonawanda,
N.Y. Two of the sons had died on D-Day, Edward was missing in
action in the Pacific, and Frederick was fighting somewhere in
northern France. Aware of the outcry that had occurred when all
five Sullivan brothers had been killed two years earlier, the Army
organized a successful search for Frederick. A year later, the
family received word that Edward was alive in a Japanese POW camp.
</P>
<P>
   CIRCLING THE WAGONS: When Harry Thomason watched Bill Clinton
make his first public statement about Monica Lewinsky on Jan. 21,
he knew his old friend was in trouble. So, according to Jeffrey
Toobin in a juicy New Yorker ($3) article, Thomason and his wife,
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason (creators of TV's ``Designing Women'')
offered their help. Clinton's subsequent _ and more forceful _
denial is credited to Thomason's advice. ``Harry is like a throat
lozenge,'' says Clinton adviser James Carville, ``there's something
very soothing about him.''

 &HT;    A really clever headline needs to go here
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA--With suffocating heat, strangulating traffic and
choking smog, it only makes sense as the next big summer
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   A 5-foot-tall flower that smells like rotting human flesh.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today Atlantans can drop in _ and maybe drop over _ at
the Atlanta Botanical Garden and catch one of the rarest events in
horticulture: the blooming of the exotic Amorphophallus titanum , a
plant with the double distinction of being both the world's largest
and the world's foulest-smelling flower.
</P>
<P>
   Just how bad does it stink?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it's a cross between fresh cow manure and a dead
animal,'' says Ron Gagliardo, the Garden's curator of tropical
plants, who's spent the last few weeks nurturing the bud to
maturity with a diet of chicken manure.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday workers moved the flower in its 250-pound pot from the
greenhouse to display in the lobby of the Dorothy Chapman Fuqua
Conservatory. Gagliardo said he expects it to bloom by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The flower only stinks when it's in blossom. Botanists theorize
that's because in the wild of its native Sumatra the flowers are
pollinated by stench-loving carrion beetles.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Titan arum'' will stay in bloom for two or three days.
Then its phallus-like center stalk, or ``spadix,'' will topple, and
the yearslong regeneration process will begin again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it survives, it's hard to say when it will bloom again,''
said Gagliardo. ``We've had this plant since 1994, and this is the
first time it's bloomed. They're highly unpredictable.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no special plans to ventilate the conservatory to
offset the flower's stench. Visitors can expect to have a pretty
rotten time.
</P>
<P>
   Or they can take the advice of Madeleine Groves, the Garden's
coordinator of conservation programs, who worked at a London garden
when its Titan bloomed _ and people started gagging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just looked around the Army surplus stalls for a few gas
masks.''

TRIPP SET TO FACE GRAND JURY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ White House aides, lawyers, and political spinners
have all had their chance to discuss the alleged sexual
relationship between President Clinton and a White House intern.
Tuesday morning Linda Tripp, who touched off the scandal, gets her
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after going to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr with
homemade tape recordings of conversations with Monica S. Lewinsky,
Tripp finally will testify before his federal grand jury. Tripp, a
Pentagon employee, is expected to discuss why she secretly taped
her friend and what she learned from their frequent talks about the
former White House intern's alleged sexual relationship with
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty to tell, said Lucianne Goldberg, a literary agent
and conservative activist who in 1996 tried to get Tripp to write a
book about White House scandals. ``Only half of it is the tapes,''
Goldberg said in an interview Monday. ``You have to realize that
Linda Tripp was working in the White House when the Clintons moved
in, so she has other things to talk about.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what more Tripp could reveal, Goldberg would say only
``things, people.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tripp's critics at the White House and elsewhere have
questioned her motivation, saying she pretended to be a confidante
while prodding Lewinsky to make statements damaging to the
president. They also question whether she and Goldberg were trying
to cash in on controversies involving Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This much is clear: the rumors, political bickering, and legal
skirmishes prompted by Tripp have not subsided. In a marble-lined
federal appeals court Monday, Clinton's lawyers squared off with
Starr over whether the president can invoke attorney-client
privilege to shield one of his aides from questioning in the
Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's team of prosecutors is investigating whether Clinton and
Lewinsky, who both gave sworn testimony in the Paula Jones's sexual
harassment case against the president, lied under oath when they
denied having a sexual relationship. Starr is also trying to
determine if Clinton and his top aides tampered with witnesses and
obstructed justice.
</P>
<P>
   Starr told the three-judge panel that Bruce Lindsey, the
president's adviser and lawyer, must be compelled to testify about
his discussed it with Clinton. Unlike a private lawyer, a
government lawyer represents not just an individual but an
institution, Starr said. The grand jury in the Lewinsky
investigation must have all ``relevant'' information that deputy
White House counsel Lindsey gathered in his discussions with
Clinton and others, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr compared Clinton to a chief executive officer who seeks
advice about a legal problem from one of his company's lawyers. The
lawyer has a responsibility to the company, not just the CEO, Starr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Neil Eggleston, representing the White House, said
Starr has no grounds for seeking information about discussions that
Clinton, Lindsey and the president's private lawyers held about how
to deal with the Lewinsky investigation. A president who cannot be
assured of privacy in his talks with lawywers would effectively be
``completely and irrevocably deprived'' of legal advice, Eggleston
said.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters, the Justice Department disagreed with both
Clinton and Starr. The department, taking a middle path, urged that
the case between returned the district court with instructions that
evidence should be surrendered to the grand jury only if it is
deemed ``essential to ... justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal district court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson has already
backed Starr. Monday's arguments were filled with hypothetical
discussions about a president facing impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time ever a president has asserted executive
privilege in response to a grand jury subpoena,'' said Appeals
Court J. Raymond Randolph.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the woman who was the original trigger for these
debates remained silent Monday. Tripp has remained at her
$88,200-a-year public relations job at the Pentagon, though she
works from a secret location.
</P>
<P>
   Back before she sought out Starr, Tripp was one of the many
civil servants who work in near-anonymity in Washington. Now she
has two lawyers, a spokesman, a team of volunteers raising money
for her legal fund, a web site and even a bumper sticker issued by
her fans. Desperate for any scrap of information, reporters have
even interviewed neighbors in suburban Virginia about Tripp's
dog-walking habits.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp is expected to appear before the grand jury for three
days. For all the media furor, she remains enigmatic. She has said
little about her motives for going to Starr. Indeed, she has not
spoken in public since making a brief statement on Jan. 21, after
the allegations of the Lewinsky liaison first broke and existence
of the 20 hours of tapes was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   It was also revealed that Tripp had met Lewinsky in a hotel in
January and, at Starr's request, made secret tapes of their
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said there is no mystery to Tripp's behavior. Tripp,
she said, was angered by a list of ``talking points'' that she
received from Lewinsky, which suggested possible answers they could
give in testimony that would help Clinton in the Jones's case. The
author of the list has not been revealed, but Tripp's supporters
suggest a Clinton aide drew it up for Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was being asked to commit perjury by the most powerful man
in the world, through his surrogates, and she didn't want to do
it,'' Goldberg said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court aimed for clarity and, to an
unusual degree, achieved it in the term that ended on Friday after
a final week's deluge of important rulings.
</P>
<P>
   The justices spoke forcefully in drawing a coherent rule on
sexual harassment from a jumble of confusing judicial precedents
and vague congressional language.
</P>
<P>
   They established a framework for applying the new federal
disability law's protections to people with asymptomatic HIV
infection and other conditions that may not at first glance appear
to qualify as disabling.
</P>
<P>
   They quickly put to rest the experiment by Congress with the
line-item veto as well as the independent counsel's effort to
pierce the shield of the attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   These decisions, and nearly all the others of the term's 91
rulings, were supported by clear majorities, free of the
ambiguities that often plague the court's efforts to wrestle with
highly charged subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Few Supreme Court decisions in recent memory have been received
as enthusiastically across the spectrum of interested parties as
the twin sexual harassment rulings, praised by women's rights
leaders, the Chamber of Commerce, and federal trial judges alike
for providing the first clear set of rules in this rapidly
developing area of employment law.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true, however, that the court was spared this term
from having to deal with disputed areas of the law on which there
is little common ground among the justices. There were no
federalism cases, for example. The last-minute settlement of an
affirmative action case from Piscataway, N.J., which had raised the
question of whether achieving diversity in the workplace could be a
valid justification for racial preferences, left the court for the
first time in years without a case directly confronting questions
of race.
</P>
<P>
   There was also no case involving religion, a gap that could be
filled quickly in the next term if the justices decide to resolve
the constitutionality of publicly subsidized vouchers for parochial
school tuition. For reasons that were not clear, there were 31
decisions involving criminal law _ more than one-third of the
docket, a much higher proportion than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Of the term's 91 decisions, up from 80 last year, nearly half,
43, were decided by 9-to-0 votes, unanimous in result although not
always in reasoning. Fifteen cases, including several of the term's
most important, were decided by 5-to-4 votes.
</P>
<P>
   These included: the decision on the application of the federal
disability law to people with the virus that causes AIDS; a ruling
that, in contrast to the other sexual harassment cases, took a
restrictive view under a different federal law of the rights of
students to sue school districts for harassment by teachers; and a
decision that the interest on short-term deposits that clients
leave with their lawyers is the property of the clients, calling
into question the current use of that money to help finance legal
services programs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the outcome in 5-to-4 cases was the vote of Justice
Anthony M. Kennedy, who voted in the majority in these cases and in
all but two of the 15 in this category. Given the existing
divisions on the court, whichever side persuaded Kennedy took a
giant step toward winning the case.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, with some significant exceptions, that was the
conservative side. In 35 cases that found Justices John Paul
Stevens and Antonin Scalia on opposite sides _ a rough but
reasonably accurate proxy for cases with some ideological content _
Kennedy voted 22 times with Scalia, who along with Justice Clarence
Thomas is the court's most conservative member, and 13 times with
Stevens, arguably its most liberal.
</P>
<P>
   Over the entire term, Kennedy cast only five dissenting votes, a
remarkably small number. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor tied for second in the category of
fewest dissents, with 10 each. These three essentially defined the
center of the court. The most dissenting votes were cast by Stevens
with 22 and Scalia with 19.
</P>
<P>
   That Rehnquist, who joined the court in 1971 and was a
conservative voice in the wilderness for perhaps the first 15 years
of his tenure, could be described as occupying the center of the
court is a measure of how the spectrum has shifted over the years.
</P>
<P>
   While Justices David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen
G. Breyer, along with Stevens, are undoubtedly the Court's
liberals, there were several reminders this term of how relative a
label that is. For example, there were no dissents from an opinion
by Souter, in County of Sacramento vs. Lewis, holding that the
police cannot be found liable for injury or death from high-speed
chases unless they acted with ``a purpose to cause harm.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the liveliest debates on the court, in fact, are taking
place not between liberals and conservatives, but within the
conservative bloc itself. For example, the court ruled in United
States vs. Bajakajian, a 5-to-4 decision by Thomas, that a
government-imposed criminal forfeiture was unconstitutional as an
``excessive fine.'' The four liberals, whose skepticism of
prosecutorial authority appeared to coalesce with Thomas'
solicitude for private property rights, voted in the majority.
Kennedy, who was joined in dissent by Rehnquist, Scalia and
O'Connor, objected in angry tones that the court was impeding the
federal government's efforts to fight crime.
</P>
<P>
   Two other decisions in criminal law cases left Scalia and Thomas
isolated as the only votes to uphold prosecution positions that the
other justices appeared to regard as extreme. Rehnquist wrote the
majority opinions in both the cases, Stewart vs. Martinez-Villareal
and Bousley vs. United States, granting inmates new federal court
hearings. In the Bousley case, Rehnquist said there was a
``significant risk'' that the defendant had been wrongly convicted,
while a dissenting opinion by Scalia and Thomas stressed the need
for a ``rule of finality.''
</P>
<P>
   Those two justices also found themselves isolated in the two
sexual harassment cases, decided by 7-to-2 votes on the term's
final day.
</P>
<P>
   These two decisions, for which the Supreme Court's 1997-98 term
is likely to be best remembered, had little to do with ideology.
Rather, they drew a broad majority together in a pragmatic search
for ``manageable standards,'' as Souter put it in one of the
majority opinions. Thomas' objection that the court was engaging in
``willful policymaking, pure and simple'' could not shake the
majority's resolve.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Here are summaries of the major rulings of the term, which began
last Oct. 6 and ended on June 26.
</P>
<P>
   SEXUAL HARASSMENT
</P>
<P>
   The court clarified the law of sexual harassment in the
workplace, making some sexual harassment suits easier for employees
to win and at the same time indicating that employers can limit
their legal liability by adopting effective anti-harassment
policies and complaint procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The new rules came in a pair of decisions in separate cases that
shared some crucial language. The vote in both was 7 to 2, with
Scalia and Thomas dissenting. Souter wrote the majority opinion in
Faragher vs. City of Boca Raton, No. 97-282, making clear that
employers are responsible for preventing and eliminating harassment
in the workplace. They can be liable for even those harassing acts
of supervisory employees that violate clear policies and of which
top management has no knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   In Burlington Industries, Inc. vs. Ellerth, No. 97-569, in an
opinion by Kennedy, the court said employees could sue even without
being able to show job-related harm, but must have made use of
effective complaint policies and other protection offered by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In a third case, the court expanded the category of people
protected by federal law against workplace harassment, ruling
unanimously that the law covers harassment by people of the same
sex. What matters, Scalia said in his unanimous opinion in Oncale
vs. Sundowner Offshore Services, No. 96-568, is the conduct at
issue, not the sex of the people involved and not the presence or
absence of sexual desire, whether heterosexual or homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   While ruling expansively in the employment cases, the court
interpreted a different law and set a highly restrictive standard
for determining when a school district can be found liable under
federal law for a teacher's sexual harassment of a student. Voting
5 to 4, the court said a victim can recover damages from the school
district only if an official with authority to intervene knew of
the situation and, acting with ``deliberate indifference,'' failed
to stop the harassment. O'Connor wrote the majority opinion in
Gebser vs. Lago Vista Independent School District, No. 96-1866,
joined by Rehnquist and Scalia, Kennedy, and Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   LINE-ITEM VETO
</P>
<P>
   The Line-Item Veto Act of 1996, giving the president the power
to cancel provisions of statutes he has signed into law, is
unconstitutional, the court ruled, because the Constitution
specifies the exclusive means for enacting laws and does not give
the president the power to cancel parts or to amend them. The vote
in Clinton vs. City of New York, No. 97-1374, was 6 to 3, with
Stevens writing for the majority and Scalia, Breyer, and O'Connor
dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   EVIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   The justices rejected an effort by the Whitewater independent
counsel, Kenneth Starr, to persuade them to change the rules for
the lawyer-client privilege after the client dies. The privilege
remains absolute, Rehnquist said in a 6-to-3 opinion that had the
effect of blocking Starr's effort to get notes of a conversation
that the former deputy White House counsel, Vincent W. Foster Jr.,
had with a lawyer shortly before committing suicide. O'Connor,
Scalia, and Thomas dissented in Swidler &AMP; Berlin vs. U.S., No.
97-1192, and said there should be a posthumous exception to the
privilege for some criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   DISCRIMINATION
</P>
<P>
   The court made new law by ruling that the Americans with
Disabilities Act offers protection against discrimination to people
who are infected with the virus that causes AIDS, even if they show
no symptoms of disease. The 5-to-4 majority applies the l990 law's
definition of disability, an impairment that substantially limits a
major life activity, to a woman who said she had decided never to
have children because of her HIV-positive status. She sued under
the law when a dentist refused to treat her in his office. Justice
Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in Bragdon vs. Abbott, No.
97-156, joined by Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the court ruled unanimously that Congress intended
the disability law to apply to inmates in state prisons. Scalia
wrote the opinion in Pennsylvania vs. Yeskey, No. 97-686.
</P>
<P>
   A splintered decision cast serious constitutional doubt on a
federal law that makes the American citizenship of foreign-born
illegitimate children dependent on whether it was their mother or
their father who was a United States citizen. If the mother is an
American, the child can be deemed an American citizen at birth. But
if citizenship is claimed through an American father, that parent
must acknowledge paternity before the child turns 18. The law was
challenged on equal-protection grounds by the Philippines-born
daughter of a U.S. serviceman who did not acknowledge paternity
until the daughter was 21.
</P>
<P>
   Three justices, Ginsburg, Breyer, and Souter, found the law
unconstitutional and two others, O'Connor and Kennedy, suggested
that it was. But the vote was nonetheless 6 to 3 to uphold it
because O'Connor and Kennedy said that the daughter did not have
standing to challenge the law; only the father did, they said, and
he was not before the court. The decision to uphold the law, Miller
vs. Albright, No. 96-1060, was written by Stevens and joined by
Rehnquist; in addition to O'Connor and Kennedy, Scalia and Thomas
voted with the majority on separate grounds.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 5 to 4, the court rejected new, restrictive rules
for an important category of civil rights suits against public
officials that would have made it easier for such suits to be
dismissed before trial, and even before pre-trial discovery.
Writing for the majority, Justice Stevens said that it was not the
business of judges to change the law, as the federal appeals court
here did last year when it ruled that suits alleging that an
official acted with an unconstitutional motive should be dismissed
before trial unless the plaintiff offered ``clear and convincing
evidence'' of the official's state of mind. Kennedy, Ginsburg,
Breyer, and Souter joined the majority in Crawford-El vs. Britton,
No. 96-827, which reinstated a lawsuit by a District of Columbia
prison inmate claiming that officials retaliated against him for
exercising his right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   FREE SPEECH
</P>
<P>
   The court upheld a decency test for awarding federal arts
grants, but only after a majority interpreted the 1990 law as
containing only ``advisory language'' that did not actually
prohibit federal subsidies for indecent art. The vote in National
Endowment for the Arts vs. Finley, No. 97-371, was 8 to 1, with a
majority opinion by O'Connor and a lone dissent by Souter. Two
members of the majority, Scalia and Thomas, said the law did have
real teeth but was constitutional anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled 6 to 3 that government-owned television stations
have the editorial discretion to exclude minor-party candidates
from political debates, as long as the exclusion is not based on
the candidate's views. In his majority opinion, Arkansas
Educational Television Commission vs. Forbes, No. 96-779, Kennedy
said that a candidate debate was not a public forum, like a street
corner or a park, but a ``nonpublic forum'' subject to reasonable
restrictions to prevent it from being overrun by unmanageable
numbers of participants.
</P>
<P>
   The case was brought by a former Nazi and self-described
Christian supremacist who was running for Congress in Arkansas and
sought access to a debate at a state-run public television station.
Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg dissented.
</P>
<P>
   CRIMINAL LAW
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled that a suspect's fear of prosecution overseas
does not require prosecutors to honor the Fifth Amendment privilege
against self-incrimination which, the court ruled in a 7 to 2
decision by Souter, applies only in domestic criminal proceedings.
Ginsburg and Breyer dissented in United States vs. Balsys, No.
97-873. The case grew out of the refusal by a suspected Nazi
collaborator from Lithuania, in the United States for nearly 40
years, to testify in a preliminary investigation that could lead to
his deportation and prosecution in Lithuania or Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled for the first time that a criminal forfeiture
sought by the government was unconstitutional under the Eighth
Amendment's prohibition of ``excessive fines.'' A man whose only
crime was failing to report that he was taking more than $10,000
out of the country could not be made to forfeit the entire amount
of the undeclared cash _ $357,144 _ as provided by the reporting
statute, the court held in a 5-to-4 decision by Thomas. Stevens,
Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer joined the decision, United States vs.
Bajakajian, No. 96-1487.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-to-0 decision made it unlikely that the police can ever be
found liable for death or injury from high-speed chases. In an
opinion by Souter, the court held that the police must have acted
with ``a purpose to cause harm'' for victims to be able to
establish liability; negligence or recklessness is not sufficient.
The case was County of Sacramento vs. Lewis, No. 96-1337.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 8 to 1, that criminal defendants do not have a
constitutional right to present evidence at trial of having passed
a lie-detector test. The reliability of polygraphs has not been
sufficiently established, Thomas said in a majority opinion that
overturned a ruling by the highest court in the military justice
system. Stevens dissented in the case, United States vs. Scheffer,
No. 96-1133.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled, 5 to 4, that the exclusionary rule that bars
prosecutors from introducing illegally seized evidence at trial
does not apply to parole revocation hearings. Thomas wrote the
opinion in Pennsylvania Board of Probation vs. Scott, No. 97-581.
</P>
<P>
   STATES
</P>
<P>
   In a rare interpretation of the Constitution's ``full faith and
credit'' clause, which generally obliges states to respect one
another's legal judgments, the court ruled 9 to 0 that
notwithstanding that obligation, one state's court system cannot
bind another's to an agreement barring particular testimony or
evidence from a trial.
</P>
<P>
   The case, Baker vs. General Motors, No. 96-653, concerned an
automobile industry whistleblower, who had agreed in a Michigan
court settlement with General Motors not to testify against the
company as an expert witness. He was then subpoenaed by plaintiffs
in a case against GM in Missouri. The federal appeals court there
barred the testimony on the basis of the Michigan court order. In
her opinion overturning that ruling, Justice Ginsburg said that
Michigan lacked authority to limit other states' courts in their
``search for the truth.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   In one of its most important antitrust rulings in years, the
court ruled unanimously that manufacturers can set ceilings on
retail markups without necessarily violating the Sherman Antitrust
Act. O'Connor's opinion for the court overruled a 1968 precedent
that had labeled as illegal price-fixing the practice known as
resale price maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that the earlier decision was based on bad
economics and that limiting the price a retailer can charge can be
good for consumers as well as good for the manufacturer's business.
Under the new decision, State Oil vs. Khan, No. 96-871, which began
as a dispute between a gasoline supplier and a retail dealer, the
legality of price ceilings will be based on a case-by-case analysis
of the effect on competition.
</P>
<P>
   By a 5-to-4 vote, the court handed the banking industry an
important victory in its battle against credit unions for the
consumer banking dollar. The court invalidated a 1982 federal
regulation that had permitted credit unions to expand far beyond
their traditional base in tightly defined employee or community
groups. The regulation did not properly interpret a 1934 federal
law that limited credit union membership to groups having a
``common bond,'' Thomas said in his opinion, National Credit Union
Administration vs. First National Bank &AMP; Trust Co., No. 96-843.
Rehnquist and Kennedy, Justice Ginsburg, and Scalia also voted in
the majority.
</P>
<P>
   A unanimous opinion virtually insured the continued flourishing
of the multibillion-dollar ``gray market'' in unauthorized imports.
The court ruled that copyright law is of no use to a manufacturer
seeking to block the domestic resale of American-made goods
initially distributed overseas, because once a ``first sale'' has
taken place, the copyright owner has no further control over a
product's fate. Stevens wrote the opinion, Quality King
Distributors vs. L'Anza Research International, No. 96-1470.
</P>
<P>
   In an important interpretation of the federal Superfund law on
environmental cleanups, the court ruled unanimously that
corporations cannot ordinarily be held responsible for cleaning up
the pollution caused by activities of their subsidiaries. However,
the court said in an opinion by Souter, the parent corporation can
be liable if it has directly operated, as opposed to merely
supervised, the subsidiary's facility. The case was United States
vs. Bestfoods, No. 97-454.
</P>
<P>
   PROPERTY
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled 5 to 4 that interest on the money that clients
leave on deposit for short periods with their lawyers is the
property of the clients. While this was only a preliminary ruling,
it cast in doubt the future of a program, adopted by all 50 states,
that generates some $100 million a year for legal services for the
poor from the interest on pooled small client accounts.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, the individual deposits would be too small to
earn net interest after the expenses of setting up the accounts.
Nonetheless, Rehnquist said in his majority opinion, ``interest
follows principal,'' and the interest must be considered the
clients' property even if, as a practical matter, no interest would
otherwise exist. Now the lower courts must decide whether the
programs amount to an unconstitutional ``taking'' of the private
property. Scalia, Thomas, O'Connor, and Kennedy joined the majority
opinion, Phillips vs. Washington Legal Foundation, No. 96-1578.
</P>
<P>
   The court struck down a 1992 law that required companies
previously in the coal mining business to assume retroactive
liability for health benefits for miners and their families. A
plurality of four justices, in an opinion by O'Connor, said the
Coal Act amounted to an unconstitutional taking of the companies'
property. Rehnquist, Scalia, and Thomas joined that opinion.
Kennedy provided a fifth vote to declare the law unconstitutional
on due process grounds. The case was Eastern Enterprises vs. Apfel,
No. 97-42.
</P>
<P>
   BOUNDARIES
</P>
<P>
   In the long-running battle over Ellis Island, the court awarded
victory to New Jersey over New York by a vote of 6 to 3. All the
landfilled portion, or roughly 90 percent of the island through
which some 12 million immigrants passed during the years from 1892
to 1954, is New Jersey territory under the terms of an 1934
interstate compact, Souter said in his majority opinion. Stevens,
Scalia, and Thomas dissented. The decision, New Jersey vs. New
York, No. 120 original, will have little practical effect because
the National Park Service runs the historic sites on the 27-acre
island, but the psychological impact appears to have been
considerable.

GIANTS TRY TO RESTORE THEIR TRADITION OF DEVELOPING HISPANIC
PLAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JORGE L. ORTIZ  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Peter Magowan became a Giants fan during the
days when such Latin luminaries as Orlando Cepeda, Juan Marichal,
Jose Pagan and the Alou brothers populated the team's roster in the
late '50s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   When the ownership group he heads acquired the club in December
1992, Magowan vowed to reawaken the long-dormant tradition of
homegrown Latin American players on the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't just driven by a pang of nostalgia. Magowan was aware
of the growing presence of Hispanics in the major leagues _ they
make up nearly 20 percent of the rosters today _ and he wanted the
Giants to get their share of the wealth.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks after he took over, the Giants named Luis Rosa
as their coordinator of Latin American operations. The move seemed
like a coup at the time. Rosa had discovered such talented players
as Juan Gonzalez, Roberto and Sandy Alomar, Carlos Baerga, Ivan
Rodriguez, Ozzie Guillen and Wilson Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   Yet more than five years after Rosa's hiring, the Giants still
haven't developed a front-line Hispanic player, a streak of
futility that dates all the way back to Elias Sosa in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   And now they find themselves with a legal mess on their hands.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa resigned from the Giants _ he says the team forced him out
_ on June 13, 1997, the day before eight former players went on
Dominican television and said Rosa had demanded sexual favors as a
condition of employment. They also accused Rosa of embezzling part
of their signing bonuses and salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Seven more players later joined the complaint, but since then
three of the original players have retracted their story and said
it was all part of a scheme to extort money from Rosa and the
Giants. Rosa traveled to the Dominican voluntarily to face the
charges and spent four months in a San Pedro de Macoris jail before
being let out in March on $40,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal and civil charges against Rosa are pending. The 12
remaining players have also sued the Giants in civil court in the
Dominican Republic, as well as both Rosa and the Giants in U.S.
District Court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Team vice president and legal counsel Jack Bair said: ``If the
allegations are true _ and there's considerable dispute over
whether they're true, obviously, with three individuals retracting
_ but if the allegations are proven to be true, then Rosa will have
violated our policy and have acted clearly out of bounds with
respect to conduct of an employee. Certainly the Giants would never
sanction such behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the hint of such behavior could have severely damaged the
team's Latin-American efforts, which haven't borne much fruit
anyway. But the quick parting of the ways between the Giants and
Rosa appears to have prevented further harm.
</P>
<P>
   Several scouting directors from competing teams indicated the
Giants' reputation in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico,
Rosa's base of operations, has not been hurt appreciably.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first they got hit hard with all the TV commotion and all
the newspaper articles,'' said Raymond Abreu, the Oakland A's
director of operations in the Dominican. ``But since it has died
down and everything's back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a couple of kids who have signed with the Giants
without any problems. I mean, if the problem was Luis Rosa _ which
I'm not saying he was _ but he's gone anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he would have stayed, it would have been way different,
after all these testimonies and after all these court dates here in
the Dominican. If he would have stayed, it would have impacted the
Giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Julian Perez, the Braves' scouting supervisor in the
Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico: ``I haven't heard any prospect
say, `Damn, I hope it's not San Francisco.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants retrenched and hired John Dipuglia from the St. Louis
Cardinals organization to take over Rosa's old duties, and they
named Ozzie Virgil manager of their summer-league team in San Pedro
de Macoris, site of their baseball academy.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Ragazzo, the ~Giants' coordinator of international
operations, said the team now has five instructors and two trainers
at the academy, plus a head scout who scours the island along with
five other scouts under him.
</P>
<P>
   Ragazzo added that prospects receive English training and even
go on trips to the States so they get exposed to the different
coaching, language, culture, weather, food, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do a lot,'' Ragazzo said. ``Other than maybe the Dodgers or
possibly the Blue Jays of five years ago, we do as much as
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years that wasn't the case. At one time the
Giants had only one scout in Puerto Rico and none in Venezuela.
Although the team has since taken steps to increase its presence,
it still lags behind other clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Money has been _ and continues to be _ a major factor. For a
while the Giants had a baseball academy in the Venezuelan city of
Barquisimeto, but they have since closed it and are pondering
whether it will be cost-effective to open another one elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime Houston has become the dominant team in the
Venezuelan market. The Astros are one of several clubs spending
heavily on Latin prospects, along with the Braves, Diamondbacks,
White Sox, Dodgers, Rangers, Yankees and Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have the economic wherewithal to compete with those
major-market clubs on a per-player basis,'' Ragazzo acknowledged.
``However, if we're a little more selective in how we spend our
money, then yes, I think we can be as competitive, if not more in
certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   That selective approach has worked for the tight-fisted Pirates,
who are benefiting from their investment and contacts in Mexico.
Pitchers Francisco Cordova, Jose Silva, Esteban Loaiza and Ricardo
Rincon all come from south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   They are part of the steadily increasing number of Latin
Americans in the big leagues. According to Major League Baseball,
Latinos represented 17.5 percent of the players on Opening-Day
rosters, including players on the disabled list. That figure grows
to nearly 20 percent when U.S.-born players of Hispanic parents _
including such stars as Alex Rodriguez, Edgar Martinez and Alex
Fernandez _ are included.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants don't seem close to cashing in on the bonanza. In
early '93, a couple of months after joining the organization, Rosa
said he had signed two infielders ``who are going to have people in
San Francisco dancing in the streets in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Unless they were involved in Carnaval festivities, that
prediction hasn't come true. The Giants' media guide shows only two
players signed by Rosa were included on the preseason 40-man
roster: Triple-A outfielder Armando Rios, 26, and third baseman
Pedro Felix, 21.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the best prospects Rosa left behind _ Felix, catcher
Yorvit Torrealba and infielder Raul Marval _ were having so-so
years at Double-A Shreveport as the halfway point of the season
approached. Torrealba has been demoted to Single-A San Jose, where
his hitting has picked up. All three are still a ways from getting
to the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   The only player Rosa signed for the Giants who has reached the
majors is Dominican shortstop Deivi Cruz. The Tigers stole him away
in the Rule V draft. Two other promising prospects, pitchers Fausto
Macey and Lorenzo Barcelo, were packaged in the trades that brought
in J.T. Snow, Alvarez and Roberto Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, 52, blames the lack of production on the Giants' inability
to develop the players he delivered them and on poor management at
the minor-league level. He also accused the club of stifling the
progress of Latin players and of turning its back on him at a time
of need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Giants forced me out with some irregular tactics to get to
the point of resigning, to get to the point where mentally I wasn't
in position to make the best decision,'' said Rosa, who denies the
charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They decided to throw me overboard and let me swim on my own.
They didn't realize my situation affected them too. They totally
abandoned me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Bair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team's obligation is to look into the matter in a
fair-minded way,'' he said. ``I'm sure he would like us to say,
`Regardless of what the claims are, we stand behind you.' We didn't
do that. We took the responsible approach to the matter and I'm
sure he was disappointed that we wanted to look into the matter
prior to making any assessments.''
</P>
<P>
   General manager Brian Sabean said: ``He was hired before I got
here, and if you look at his track record with other organizations,
you'll understand the reason he was hired.''

<P>
   MILAN, Italy _ Romance has come to menswear here, an apt
development in the age of Viagra. Designers like Jil Sander,
Donatella Versace, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and Issey Miyake have been
careful, though, as they infuse their spring clothes with soft,
fanciful touches, to preserve the swagger of masculinity.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Gabbana, half of the Dolce &AMP; Gabbana design team, said
that he and Domenico Dolce discarded two looks from the collection
because they were too feminine. ``This is a strong romantic,''
Gabbana said. ``It's always masculine. I don't like for a man to be
feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   Flesh rippling through sheer sweaters, embroidery twisting down
trousers and sequins dancing across jackets have the ominous ring
of clothes for girls. But if there was one bar that designers here
were able to hurl successfully, it was the challenge of making
softer clothes manly.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that one can see Ms. Sander's influence on runways
other than her own seems to spur her forward. Using the word
``cheerful'' to describe her clothes, as she did in the program
notes for the collection that she showed Monday, is using the word
creatively. Ms. Sander has never strayed from her austere fashion
vision. What was new here was the effortlessness of sportswear and
even suits.
</P>
<P>
   The relaxation of menswear begins with the basic teaming of a
shirt and a pair of trousers, offered as a man might wear a suit.
Ms. Sander showed elastic-waist trousers in cotton and white
zip-front shirts in Egyptian cotton. A navy tubular sweater was
paired with below-the-knee dark teal shorts cut like parachute
pants.
</P>
<P>
   Many jackets were unlined and rolled easily over the shoulder
with a modified raglan cut. They evoked the same zephyrlike feeling
as the white or khaki trousers that the models wore rolled up
slightly at the ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Are men ready to free themselves from the restriction of suits?
To some degree, yes. Certainly, not all the time. Ms. Sander's
proposal of the suit without its traditional constriction is
timely, and it is not as difficult as Ms. Versace's use of sequins
and embroidery as decoration for men's clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting a slimmer suit jacket than her line Gianni Versace has
shown in the recent past, Ms. Versace sensualized sweaters with
bands of matte sequins across the torso. A tiny feathered white
stripe ran down one leg of tuxedo pants, and embroidered dragons in
baby blue fire-breathed their way across the chest of gray suit
jackets. She paired white-leather fitted vests with pants
embellished with tiny appliques of feathery fabric, a traditionally
feminine textile.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Versace adapted ideas on display on runways of emerging
designers, like the cutaway jacket, and she added many of her own:
a leather shirt whipcorded with thin silver chain; smoothly
finished burned-out shirts, and a black lace lining for a sheer
black cutaway jacket. She replaced last season's rhinestone
embellishments with more sophisticated clear matte sequins on
sleeves and jackets. Her attempt to add some excitement with small
harness straps was less successful. They dangled from otherwise
appealing jackets and a white lab coat like misplaced participles.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Versace and Dolce &AMP; Gabbana have always served the
adventurous dresser, these collections have elements for a meeker
customer, as well. It was more than coincidence that both design
houses turned to the macho spatter prints of Jackson Pollock for
stimulation.
</P>
<P>
   Dolce and Gabbana enlivened black sweaters and white shirts with
colorful injections of paint, and that was mostly where the color
ended. The wonderfully limited palette _ black, gray and white,
mostly _ was fashioned into uniformlike jackets that had little
extraneous seaming.
</P>
<P>
   For suits, there were Mao-style jackets of cotton topping
relaxed pants. Designs were cast in a gray melange cotton that
Steffano said is used for the uniform for Milan's sanitation
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Pants paired with skinny sweaters bore seams at the points of
movement: the knee, the ankle. The inspiration, Gabbana said, was
the anatomical work of Leonardo. A bit of fashion chauvinism,
perhaps. In fact, the soft, blousy pants, like much of the
collection, seemed Asian at root.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Asian influence has seeped back into menswear.
Barneys New York, for instance, is making Japanese designers like
Yohji Yamamoto, Miyake and Rei Kawakubo centerpieces of its fall
season.
</P>
<P>
   Even Vivienne Westwood had, among her romance-gone-awry pieces,
some artfully draped shorts and trousers and long nylon coats
tucked and folded in the Japanese tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps sensing his moment again, Miyake moved his show to Milan
from Paris, where he has shown for more than a decade. The idea,
said Nancy Knox, a spokeswoman for the designer, is to be closer to
the source of manufacturing and at the same time to create stronger
ties with the powerful Italian manufacturers, particularly in the
area of knitwear. Miyake's defection is yet another blow to the
French, who see the number of important menswear designers who
choose to show in Paris dwindling.

   Designed by Naoki Takizawa, a member of Miyake's studio, the
Miyake collection was more cohesive and comprehensible than it has
recently been. Clothes were made and then shrunk to size, enabling
Takizawa to achieve an ethereal quality in his designs despite the
preponderance of suits.
</P>
<P>
   The secret lay in the butter-soft color palette and the unlined
jackets of cotton, which resembled refined calico. Here, too,
Chinese worker suits seemed paradoxically liberating. Brawny
straw-colored crocheted sweaters paired with heat-pleated pants cut
like sweat pants achieved a balance of traditional maleness with
pliability.
</P>
<P>
   More restless designers have realized that men may be ready for
some dimension in their clothing, and the traditional tools valued
in women's wear are being brought into play. Women have had little
problem defining themselves with male dress when it suits them, and
while men have not moved as far, designers are to be applauded for
trying to nudge them along.
</P>
<P>
   There is no pat on the back, though, only sure dollars, for
houses like Cerruti 1881, where numbing good taste is paramount.
Steadily evolving into a label known more for a kind of generic
avant-garde than for innovation, Cerruti, with its' khaki-colored
cotton suits and perfectly acceptable sheer sweaters, has put
itself firmly in the safe-and-not-sorry camp in Italy.

BAY STATE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE PAN AM ASSETS

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With three airplanes left to its name, one of the best known
names in aviation, Pan Am, got a new owner Monday _ a Massachusetts
railroad holding company.
</P>
<P>
   Guilford Transportation Industries Inc., which owns the Boston &AMP;
Maine and Maine Central railroads in New England, won approval from
a US bankruptcy court in Miami to buy the assets of the former Pan
Am Corp. _ two airplanes, flight certificates, spare parts, and the
trademarks _ for $24.5 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Guilford, which had earlier put up $1 million to acquire the
airline's third plane, also agreed to make an additional $4 million
infusion of operating capital to keep Pan Am alive.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Pease, executive vice president of Guilford, said in a
telephone interview that the resurrected Pan Am will continue
operating as a charter carrier, flying primarily to Caribbean
tourist destinations, while the new owners decide whether to expand
or add scheduled routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to build a base, and then see what we are going
to do next,'' Pease said in a telephone interview. ``The airline
today as a charter airline is doing well ... but we are not in a
position today to expand into a regular route system.''
</P>
<P>
   Guilford Transportation is privately held and controlled by
Timothy Mellon, 56, a reclusive financier and heir to the Mellon
banking fortune, and David Fink, 62, who as president oversees
railroad operations.
</P>
<P>
   The new corporation, Pan American Airlines Inc., will be legally
based at Guilford's offices in Billerica, Mass., but will maintain
its operational headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Memories of Pan Am past rang out as bankruptcy Judge A. Jay
Cristol, who holds a private pilot's license, approved the sale
plan Monday. ``We're all praying you'll keep the Pan Am logo
flying,'' the judge said, according to the Associated Press.
``Let's get 'em in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Mellon also is a licensed pilot and regularly flies a small jet
between his home in Connecticut and airports near Billerica, Pease
said.
</P>
<P>
   Founded in 1927 as Pan American World Airways, the original
airline operated globally for 65 years, including as the first air
service to cross the Pacific Ocean. It filed for bankruptcy in 1991
in the wake of a terrorist bombing aboard one of its planes over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
   New investors bought the Pan American name and familiar
blue-globe trademark in 1996, hoping to rebuild Pan Am as a
discount carrier. They failed, and the airline filed again for
bankruptcy protection last February, listing $94 million in debts.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,300 of Pan Am's 1,450 employees were laid off,
leaving only enough personnel to continue charter service.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank, the largest secured creditor, will get $20.5
million from the settlement approved Monday. Shareholders will get
nothing. Another distribution is expected, however, after $4
million worth of real estate in Miami is sold.
</P>
<P>
   People who still hold tickets on canceled Pan Am flights will be
entitled to $100 each in refunds. They have until Aug. 11 to make
claims. Lawyers said proof-of-claim forms are available from
Poorman-Douglas Corp., Box 4390, Portland, OR 97208-4390. The forms
also can be requested by telephone at 1-503-350-5938.

COMPAQ TO LAY OFF 1,000 WORKERS IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
and KAREN SANTOS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The 1,000 Houston layoffs announced Monday by Compaq
Computer Corp. were planned before the company's purchase of
Digital Equipment Corp. and were inevitable even if Digital hadn't
been acquired.
</P>
<P>
   The local cuts come with the elimination of factory lines that
make desktop system boards _ also known as motherboards _ and some
consumer PC operations, said Greg Petsch, Compaq's senior vice
president for manufacturing and quality.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs, in manufacturing and warehousing, are part of 5,000
worldwide, most of which are directly related to Compaq's $9
billion acquisition of Digital.
</P>
<P>
   The layoffs will take place over a 6-12 month period, with most
of them happening sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Compaq still expects about 17,000 layoffs worldwide,
which a Compaq spokesman called ``the big-picture number.'' About
15,000 of those will involve Digital employees.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000 Houston cuts represent about 7 percent of the
14,000-person work force at the company's headquarters. The
combined Compaq/Digital workforce is about 84,000.
</P>
<P>
   More job cuts are coming here, but they'll be few and will be
offset by new jobs resulting from the acquisition, Petsch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, this represents the majority of the (layoffs) that
will take place in Houston,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They are the largest number of job reductions since the company
cut about 2,000 positions through layoffs and attrition in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The local cuts are the result of ongoing changes in the way
Compaq is building and distributing its personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   From its beginning, Compaq designed and built its own
motherboards for its desktop computers. But what started as a way
to engineer technological advances into Compaq's systems, soon
became a drag on its ability to bring large numbers of PCs to
market quickly.
</P>
<P>
   With its new line of both business and consumer desktops, Compaq
has started using motherboards designed as commodities by other
manufacturers, Petsch said. As older machines that use Compaq-built
motherboards are phased out, those workers will be laid off, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Workers who assemble Compaq's lower-priced consumer PCs are
being laid off because those machines will be built in the Far East
where labor costs are cheaper. Petsch said Houston workers will
still work on Compaq's higher-priced Presario systems. That
includes PCs configured and purchased via in-store kiosks through
Compaq's new ``Built for You'' scheme.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of the consumer business, it's my sense that the
Houston factory is no longer a low-cost production plant,'' said
William Conroy, an analyst in Houston with Sanders Morris Mundy.
``Labor is just a small cost of the PC, but in an industry this
hypercompetitive, to say that every dollar counts is an
understatement. It's quarters, dimes and nickels that count.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's stock closed Monday at 29 5/16, up 3/8.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the workers streaming into a McDonald's across the street
from Compaq's northwest Harris County headquarters seemed concerned
about the layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expected it, with this big merger,'' said one employee.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was as fatalistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned. I've put in a lot of years (at Compaq). I don't
want to let it go,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is usually helpful to the employees it lays off, said
another worker.
</P>
<P>
   ``They help people get another job better than any other company
in the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sockwell, director of human resources for manufacturing at
Compaq, said the laid-off workers will receive a cash severance,
continuation of benefits and may be offered a chance to apply for
other jobs within the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also in discussion with some other firms regarding the
outplacement of these employees,'' Sockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say how many weeks of severance pay workers would
receive.
</P>
<P>
   Petsch said that even though the local layoffs were planned
before the Digital acquisition, their announcement was delayed
until Monday ``to keep all this together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We used the Digital acquisition to help validate our decision
points,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Conroy said Compaq held back word of the layoffs
because, ``It's probably more salable to do it today than three
months ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also will close its warehouse and logistics facilities in
Houston, the result of the company moving to a build-to-order
system, Petsch said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Compaq built its computers based on sales
forecasts and used its warehouses to hold inventories waiting to be
sold. But to better compete with companies such as Dell Computer,
which sells its PCs direct to buyers, Compaq now assembles
computers only after orders are received.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq's goal is to have 95 percent of its products deliverable
to the customer within five days. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Compaq also has transferred much of its storage needs to its
resellers and a network of satellite warehouses around the country,
Petsch said.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston warehouse space, as well as the assembly lines freed
up by the motherboard and consumer PC layoffs, will be used for
expansion of the built-to-order system, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq is the top PC manufacturer in the world and, with its
acquisition of Digital, is the second largest maker of all kinds of
computers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the market for personal computers is in flux. Compaq is
trying to recover from a glut of commercial PCs that flattened its
profits in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Also, recent reports show that the consumer PC market, which had
been healthy earlier in the year, slowed over the past couple of
months as buyers awaited the release of Microsoft Corp.'s new
Windows 98 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The other 4,000 manufacturing layoffs will come as Compaq closes
and consolidates plants as far away as Australia, China, Brazil and
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   It affects plants operated by Compaq, Digital and Tandem
Computer, the Cupertino, Calif.-based maker of large systems that
Compaq bought last year.
</P>
<P>
   For example, plants that builds Tandem computers in Stirling,
Scotland, and Digital machines in Irvine, Scotland, will be closed.
Their operations will be moved to Compaq's own factory in Erskine,
Scotland. The former Digital factory in Irvine will become home to
Compaq's services operation.

   MILAN, ITALY _
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Ruffo's Newest Talent &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The spate of large companies hiring young talent has speeded up
the rate at which designers move from newcomer status to
establishment insiders. Ruffo, a second-generation Italian leather
company, has hired Raf Simons and Veronique Branquinho as design
consultants for the Ruffo Research collection.
</P>
<P>
   The menswear, by Simons, is to be introduced here on Thursday.
The women's line, by Ms. Branquinho, will be shown in October,
during the spring 1999 presentations, said Joy Yaffe, the head of
sales and marketing for Ruffo.
</P>
<P>
   Simons and Ms. Branquinho replace Antonio Berardi, the British
designer whose meetings with executives at Versace in the last year
attracted considerable attention in the fashion world. Berardi
seemed about to join the Versace team, but that has not happened.
</P>
<P>
   Even more talked about than Berardi, Simons and Ms. Branquinho
burst onto the international scene from Belgium, their home base.
Linked romantically, they separately represent progressive design
voices in the postminimalist mode, with an emphasis on precise,
inventive cut.
</P>
<P>
   They were designers to watch as they appeared poised for a long
climb. But with the Ruffo contract, they have immediately become
more of a force, wielding influence on two separate collections and
collecting that valuable second paycheck, which can go a long way
toward developing and marketing their own lines. The impact that
progressive designers can have on classic lines is well documented,
but the effect goes both ways, giving the designer immediate
establishment status for a signature collection.
</P>
<P>
   Ruffo has a one-year contract with the designers. Hiring them is
part of the company's plan to raise its profile. A line of
accessories, Ruffo Origami Express, is being introduced for fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our plan is to continue to hire the designer of the moment,''
Ms. Yaffe said. ``We chose Raf because he basically represents the
fashion statement of today's man. His work is based on the Bauhaus
school and a strong influence from street culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruffo, a classic line, and Ruffo Research, its more avant-garde
counterpart, are carried in stores like Barneys New York, Bergdorf
Goodman, Louis of Boston, Neiman Marcus and Fred Segal in Los
Angeles. Most jackets in the Ruffo line cost between $1,800 and
$1,900; Ruffo Research between $2,500 and $2,800.
</P>
<P>
   Simons' own collection is scheduled to be presented in Paris on
July 3, during the French spring 1999 men's shows.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dolce &AMP; Gabbana Nights &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Forget the power lunch. Italians in the fashion business
consider the power dinner and power party a serious extension of
the business day, so the only unusual aspect of the Dolce &AMP; Gabbana
party held here on Sunday night was that, instead of being just a
celebration, it signaled the designers' entry into the club
business.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce are co-owners of the new
nightclub and restaurant where their post-show party was held.
Called Postgarage, it is at 5 Via Castello in Legnano, about a 30-
to 40-minute drive from the center of Milan.
</P>
<P>
   The club is an opportunity to extend Dolce &AMP; Gabbana without
using the designers' names, Gabbana said. They began searching for
a location two years ago at Dolce's insistence.
</P>
<P>
   But though their names are absent, their design insignia sets
the club's mood, Gabbana said. Huge leopard ottomans, red velvet
cushions, gold-leafed chairs, gold-colored floors and lamp shades
of Venetian glass were designed or chosen by the designers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like home, or one big Dolce &AMP; Gabbana showroom,'' Gabbana
said. ``I want to open more shops, but this is like another form of
communication. Everything is Dolce &AMP; Gabbana style but nothing has
the label. I don't want to build the club with the label. It should
feel like home.''
</P>
<P>
   Staff members wear black, designed, of course, by Dolce and
Gabbana. While clubs and restaurants now routinely sell clothing
and other club-brand paraphernalia, there are no plans to offer any
Dolce &AMP; Gabbana merchandise at Postgarage. And there are no plans
to turn away patrons not dressed in the same.

LAW PROFESSOR IN MICROSOFT CASE SAYS HE WAS MISINTERPRETED

   Federal antitrust lawyers aren't the only ones who have taken
issue with &UR;  &LR; last week's federal appeals court ruling in favor of
Microsoft Corp. The decision has also drawn fire from a Harvard Law
School professor who says the court based its ruling in part on a
misinterpretation of his writings.
</P>
<P>
   Einer Elhauge said that the court last week erred in throwing
out an injunction ordering Microsoft to provide computer makers a
version of its Windows 95 operating system that does not contain
the Microsoft Internet Explorer Web browser. A federal judge in
Washington had issued the injunction at the behest of the U.S.
Justice Department. Federal attorneys argued that Microsoft had
violated a 1995 antitrust consent decree by forcing computer makers
to use Internet Explorer in order to obtain Windows 95. The decree
barred Microsoft from forcing companies to buy one Microsoft
product as a condition for buying another product, a practice known
as ``tying.''
</P>
<P>
   But a three-judge appeals panel ruled 2-1 that Microsoft's
actions did not violate the consent decree, because Internet
Explorer is an integrated part of Windows 95, and not a separate
product.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court based its ruling on a standard treatise in
antitrust law, written in part by Elhauge. In an op-ed piece in
Monday's New York Times, Elhauge said the court had misread his
analysis in deciding whether Microsoft had violated the consent
decree.
</P>
<P>
   Elhauge argues that since any consumer can combine Windows 95
and Internet Explorer as well as Microsoft can, the two should be
treated as separate products. The appeals court said Microsoft, by
combining the two products, created a new integrated product that
was better.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got wrong the interpretation of the legal standard,'' he
said. ``It's a fairly subtle misinterpretation,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   He noted Microsoft faces a similar antitrust complaint in a
larger case filed last month by the US Justice Department and 20
states, thus giving the federal courts a chance to rethink the
issue.

PROGRAM TO OFFER AZT PROTECTION TO INFANTS IN THIRD WORLD
COUNTRIES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RUTH SoRELLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Since 1994, pregnant women infected with the AIDS virus
in the United States and Europe could take the antiviral drug AZT
and reduce the risk that their children would be infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a pilot project that would extend similar protection
to 30,000 infants of the Third World was announced by leaders of
the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS, the World Health
Organization and UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
   The programs will begin within the next 12 to 18 months for
HIV-positive pregnant women in 30 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to reduce the pain suffered by people like Mercy
Maklehemena, who described during a speech at the 12th World
Conference on AIDS what it is like to experience the loss of an
infant to HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Maklehemena knew she was HIV-positive when she gave birth to her
second child, a daughter, in Soweto, South Africa, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Because her health care providers knew she was infected, she was
virtually abandoned in the hospital after birth. And her baby was
kept from her. When the infant proved infected, she was given AZT,
but no one told Maklehemena about side effects. No one told her
that she could infect her child through breastfeeding.
</P>
<P>
   As the side effects increased, Maklehemena and her doctor
decided to take the child off AZT. Her baby died in the hospital
after developing a bad cough.
</P>
<P>
   ``This experience and the pain have not gone away,'' she said.
``But the painful experience has taught me how important it is for
a woman to demand to know and to get the fullest possible
information for themselves and for their babies.``
</P>
<P>
   The death of Maklehemena's child is an example of the gap
between treatment in the industrialized northern sections of the
world and the largely developing south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perinatal (mother-to-child) HIV infection is now a preventable
disease,'' said Dr. Lynn M. Mofenson, an associate chief for
research in the pediatric, adolescent and maternal AIDS branch of
the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.
</P>
<P>
   However, the treatment plan used in the United States is
complicated with the mother receiving AZT 16 weeks before birth and
during labor. The infant receives medication for six months
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   In the Third World, where such treatment is impractical, a
shorter course of treatment seemed ideal.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study in Thailand showed that giving AZT for three to
four weeks before birth, orally during labor and to the infant for
a month afterward reduced the rate of infection in infants by 50
percent, said its lead researcher Dr. Nathan Schaffer, chief of
epidemiology at the federal Centers for Disease Control. (By
comparison, the longer treatment used in the United States reduced
infection by almost 70 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   It is not a perfect solution, but it is a possible one in a
world where 32 percent of women receive no prenatal care and 40
percent give birth without an attendant, Mofenson said.
</P>
<P>
   Saving children will still cost money _ more than most nations
spend on health care for their citizens annually on a per capita
basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save a child costs $50,'' said Bernard Kouchner, minister
of health for France. He said his government is prepared to start a
study on the value of preventing mother-to-child transmission in a
developing country by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The nations of Cote d'Ivoire, Tanzania, Thailand and Uganda,
participants in studies of the short-course AZT therapy, will be
part of the new pilots. Other countries participating will be
Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Honduras, Rwanda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Young of Glaxo Wellcome Inc., the drug company that makes
AZT, said his organization already has reduced the cost of the drug
for the pilot study. ``It will cost three-fourths less than it
would in a Western setting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is also negotiating to provide initial start-up
supplies for the pilot projects free, Young said.
</P>
<P>
   But Maklehemena warned that women in the poor countries must be
part of the solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``What of the new trials and costing of services, including AZT
and other new therapies for women and babies _ what services and
follow-ups will these include?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   That is unclear, although there are indications that the
international agencies setting up the 30 pilot studies would like
to have continuing treatment as part of their work and hope to
persuade two other drug companies to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women will move mountains to have a healthy child,''
Maklehemena said. But women have not been involved in the design of
trials and they must be before they will enroll, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In other studies:
</P>
<P>
   _ Dr. Wafaie Fawzi of the Harvard School of Public Health along
with researchers in Tanzania found that multivitamins reduced
stillbirths, prematurity and low birthweight in children born to
mothers infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
   _ A new experimental drug called abacavir in combination with
two commonly used anti-AIDS drugs reduced the level of HIV in the
blood to undetectable levels _ even though it was not one of the
potent protease inhibitors. Dr. Neil Graham, director of HIV
programs for Glaxo Wellcome Inc., said the new drug could be useful
for people for whom protease inhibitors do not work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Half of young gay men in a University of California at San
Francisco study said they were engaging in high risk sex
activities, often when they did not know the HIV status of their
partners. Yet, said Dr. Dennis Osmond, an associate professor of
epidemiology and biostatistics, the activities have not yet led to
an increase in infection rates.

LITIGATION FOLLOWS TEACHER TESTING IN MANY STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Budgeted as Student-Tests)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Efforts to test the competency of teachers have touched
off courtroom battles from New York to California, and
Massachusetts almost certainly is next, specialists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Education will meet again Wednesday, when it
is expected to reverse its decision earlier this month to lower the
passing score for would-be teachers.
</P>
<P>
   If it does adopt the tougher standard, it will mean that 59
percent of 1,800 candidate who took the two-day examination in
April flunked _ a number which, some educators contend, would
invite a lawsuit on the grounds that the test was too tough.
</P>
<P>
   But a return to the stricter standard would reflect top
education officials' conclusion that even while it may be easier to
defend the lower standards in court, lawsuits over the teacher
competency tests are nearly inevitable in any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter what the standard is we're going to have a high
failure rate, either 44 or 59 percent,'' said Deputy Education
Commissioner David Driscoll. ``I think there will be a legal
challenge. Just like in other states we're going to be
challenged.''
</P>
<P>
   California's state certification test wound up in federal court
in 1996 when 50,000 Latinos, blacks and Asian-Americans charged it
was to blame for keeping minority applicants out of the classroom.
A judge upheld the exam.
</P>
<P>
   When more than 1,200 New York City teachers last year failed an
examination that was a prerequisite for state certification, the
teachers' union sued the Board of Education on the grounds that the
teachers had not been properly notified _ legal turf likely to be
replowed in any Massachusetts challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In a conciliatory move, the New York board agreed to seek
temporary licenses for 900 of the teachers who failed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts is vulnerable on the issue of notice,'' said
Roger Rice, a Boston attorney who has been involved in several
testing cases. ``They just sprung this on people at the very last
minute. I've never heard of a later test imposed than the one
Massachusetts pulled. These people were just getting measured for
their cap and gown and the state said, `Guess what? You've got to
take a test.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, Massachusetts was one of only seven states
that did not test teachers for certification. The tests drew
criticism in April after college students found out the scores
would count toward certification only a week before the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``The test development process seems to have been extremely
hasty and badly planned with little notice of either the nature of
the testing or the consequences of the testing,'' said Walter Haney
of Boston College's Center for the Study of Testing. ``It seems to
me that regardless of whether they're going to raise or lower the
passing score, there is ample ground for legal challenges.''
</P>
<P>
   Some minority groups scored substantially lower than whites on
the test, raising the possibility of a discrimination lawsuit, even
though officials said the test was reviewed to eliminate any
cultural or ethnic biases.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, after deadlocking twice on the matter, the
Massachusetts Board of Education voted to lower the passing score
for teacher candidates, touching off an election-year debate about
how to get the best and the brightest in front of Bay State
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   After first saying he could do nothing about the falling
standard for teacher certification, Acting Governor Paul Cellucci
last Friday called for competency testing for all teachers and
pledged to fire those who flunked those exams.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also said he had asked John Silber, chairman of the
Board of Education, to reconvene this week to take a fourth vote to
raise the passing standard on certification for new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Silber said he had assured Cellucci that the vote to lower the
standards for the test would be reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Schaeffer of FairTest, a Cambridge, Mass. monitoring
group that opposes teacher certification tests, said he believes if
the state opts this week for the tougher standards, it will
increase the likelihood of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Schaeffer said a certification test for new teachers in Alabama
was eliminated in 1985 after critics of the exam sued, claiming
that its standards were arbitrary and based on politics not merit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more this plays out as being driven by politics and not by
educational measurement, it makes them more open to litigation,''
Schaeffer said. ``The tests are based on the unproven belief that
you have to know this kind of stuff in order to function well in
the classroom. And that link is unproven.''

UN MOVES TO HELP WOMEN CUT RISK OF HAVING AIDS BABIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Opening a new front in the global fight against AIDS,
UN officials said Monday they would offer 30,000 pregnant women in
developing nations access to a drug regimen recently proven to cut
their risk of transmitting the AIDS virus to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million program, which will treat its initial patients
late this year, marks the first concerted effort to extend
sophisticated AIDS treatments to the world's poorest countries,
home to 90 percent of the 30.6 milion people who harbor the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The program _ which US Surgeon General David Satcher said the
Clinton administration would support with a level of funding he
would not disclose _ will prevent only a tiny fraction of the
540,000 new cases of newborn HIV infection that arise each year in
the developing nations of Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   However, UN officials and health officials from various nations
see the program as an opening wedge in an effort to bring the
benefits of AIDS research to the nations most grimly beset by the
17-year-old epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the crucial point,'' Bernard Kouchner, France's health
minister, said. ``We must start on the issue of HIV transmission
from mother to child.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Satcher and Kouchner said, the new program will
go beyond the attempt to chip away at mother-to-child transmission
of HIV. It will also make a start at providing infected mothers
with long-term anti-HIV drug treatments of the type that have
recently transformed AIDS care in rich nations.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said the Clinton administration is consulting with the
Ivory Coast in West Africa to mount a program that would offer
sophisticated antiviral treatments to infected women there after
delivery. He said he hopes such US-funded programs will be launched
in several nations.
</P>
<P>
   Without sustained treatment for HIV-infected mothers, critics
say, programs aimed merely at preventing newborn HIV infections
could turn into ``orphan factories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to let the mother die after she has
delivered her baby,'' Kouchner said. ``We will take care of women
after delivery, starting with a few hundred in the first three
sites'' of the mother-child prevention program.
</P>
<P>
   The new program to prevent mother-child HIV transmission will be
funded by an International Solidarity Fund spearheaded by France,
with the support of European Union nations, and possibly the US and
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner said he is increasingly optimistic about raising the $4
million in start-up funds even though ``some nations are very
reluctant'' to contribute. ``I talked last week to Donna Shalala,''
the US secretary of health and human services, Kouchner said. ``She
said she was interested but I haven't gotten any dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the pregnancy-focused program will be set up in 30
sites around the world, including Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Thailand,
and Uganda. In those countries, recent studies showed that
mother-child HIV transmission can be cut in half with a short
course of the drug AZT administered in the final three weeks of
pregnancy and during labor.
</P>
<P>
   With price cuts for AZT announced in March by its manufacturer,
Glaxo Wellcome, the short course will cost about $50 to provide the
drug to each expectant mother. By contrast, the longer-duration
treatment that has become standard in North America and Europe runs
$600 to $800.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of treatment in developing nations will be about
$120 per case, including the cost of HIV testing to identify which
pregnant women carry the virus, counseling women about the
implications of testing and treatment, and access to infant formula
to avoid the risk of infants' infection through breast feeding.
</P>
<P>
   It might cost $180 million to treat the approximately 1.5
million HIV-infected pregnant women in developing nations each
year. Such a program, if it could reach every infected woman, might
prevent HIV infection in 270,000 infants.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOMBAY, India _ Around noon on every business day, Jaganath Adav
strides briskly along the sidewalk of Mahatma Gandhi Road in the
heart of Bombay's business district, into the granite fortress that
serves as the head office of the Hongkong Bank in India, and rides
up to the ninth floor, where currency traders in short sleeves peer
over banks of blinking computers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the new India, awakening in recent years from economic
slumber. But Adav, 35, is a torchbearer for the old and often
disparaged India, a man plying a trade little changed in 130 years.
Even his job title, tiffin-wallah, derives from British India's
Victorian heyday, when English gentlemen who ruled the roost
partook of tiffin, a light lunch, and had it delivered by a wallah
_ an Urdu word used as a suffix to denote a function, duty or
profession.
</P>
<P>
   The India of the past had amen-wallahs, meaning church
ministers; competition-wallahs, officials selected by examination;
lemonade-wallahs, or teetotalers; lootie-wallahs, or thieves, and
poultice-wallahs, meaning paramedics. Today, it still has
box-wallahs, traders who carry their wares in boxes; car-wallahs,
the owners or drivers of cars; char-wallahs, men who serve tea;
press-wallahs, editors or reporters; Delhi-wallahs, residents of
the capital, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, as in the 1890s, when the tiffin-wallahs formed
their own trade union and called it the Bombay Tiffin Box
Suppliers' Association, men like Adav see to it that the business
people of Bombay can still have home-cooked meals personally
delivered to their desks _ without the inconvenience of carrying
meals to work themselves on overcrowded trains _ and at bargain
prices. Adav is one of 5,000 tiffin-wallahs in this city
(officially renamed Mumbai), delivering lunches to 150,000 people
daily, at a cost of about $3.80 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The tiffin-wallah business survives in an India that has the
services of American fast-food outlets and American jet-borne
courier companies. But for all the old-fangledness of the system,
Adav, who is illiterate, is part of an enterprise that demands
levels of organization, enterprise and ingenuity, not to mention
back-breaking work, and that needs to make little apology to the
more up-to-date businesses that characterize the new India.
</P>
<P>
   From the tiffin-wallahs' perspective, neither McDonald's nor
Federal Express, both making inroads in India, has thought of
anything much that is new. A network of wallahs collects the tiffin
boxes from customers' homes, or from women who cook lunches to
order, then delivers the meals by bicycle, handcart or head-borne
basket to a local railway station.
</P>
<P>
   There, they are sorted for different stations in central Bombay,
where they are re-sorted and carried to their final destination,
sometimes 45 miles from where they started. After lunch, the chain
reverses, delivering the empty tiffin boxes back home.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the enterprise are multicolored codes on the
tiffin boxes, circular metal containers that are stacked and
sealed. The codes tell the tiffin-wallahs which home the food comes
from, which railway stations must be used, who the carriers are and
the destination.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the system is virtually fail-safe, aside from
train strikes or accidents, or the unreported sickness or death of
a carrier. Ask a tiffin-wallah when he last failed a customer, and
he will scratch his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never, that I remember,'' Adav said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the efficiency, the tiffin-wallahs offer
old-fashioned values. A Code of Ethics hanging on the wall at their
union headquarters, a bare room in a dingy walk-up, lays down the
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please see to it that a customer never starves,'' says one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If for any reason successful delivery is not achieved, please
see to it that service resumes as soon as possible,'' says another.
</P>
<P>
   And, in bold face: ``Every tiffin-wallah should have his
customer's confidence, and remain well behaved at all times.''
</P>
<P>
   The union demands a six-month apprenticeship and new entrants
must buy a route. In a lucrative area like Mahatma Gandhi Road,
this can cost as much as $20 per customer. Since most carriers
deliver meals to 35 customers or more every day, buying a route
entails a hefty outlay for a carrier whose monthly income will be
about $90. One unwritten rule is that all new entrants must come
from the same rural area outside Pune, 80 miles southeast of
Bombay, that has monopolized the tiffin-wallah trade since it began
in the 1860s.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even the tiffin-wallahs say things are not what they used
to be. Their business must cope with new restrictions on Bombay's
overcrowded railway system, which forbids the lunch-men to travel
until past the morning rush hour, and then confines them and their
panniers to special freight cars. As old tiffin-wallahs retire, men
ready to step into their shoes, working 12-hour days and carrying
panniers weighing 200 pounds, are becoming scarcer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our children go to school and get educated, they don't want
to have anything to do with this business,'' said Damodar Pingle,
55, who has been a tiffin-wallah for 40 years and who is also a top
union official. ``But if they don't study, they will take over from
us. Either way, we tiffin-wallahs will survive, because we need our
customers, and they need us.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One such customer is Harosh Suvarma, a 35-year-old clerk at the
State Bank of India, who has been eating lunches delivered by Adav
to his office for 15 years. So reliable has the system been that
the two men never met until a reporter brought them together. When
Adav was told that the customer he knew only as 1B2-38H3-9 was
Suvarma, and Suvarma learned that the quiet man in the white topi
cap had kept him from going hungry for years, both seemed
unimpressed.
</P>
<P>
   Suvarma is in some ways part of the old India himself, spending
his working days poring over ledgers in a grungy cornerstone of an
industry frozen into Dickensian fustiness when it was nationalized
by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   As he ate the fish, curry, rice and pickles his mother had
cooked, Suvarma said he favored change at the bank, which has
floundered in the market-driven India of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if it would not be better for him to go down to one of
the fast-food outlets that have proliferated along Mahatma Gandhi
Road, Suvarma dissented.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go out into the street for tiffin, a little bit expensive
is there, oily food is there, upset stomach is there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A larger conclusion was offered by a lawyer who traveled down in
the elevator with Adav at the Hongkong Bank. Darshana Bogilal
Gupta, 53, educated at the London School of Economics, said there
were many things in India that might seem fusty to Westerners that
worked perfectly well, and should not be changed in the rush to
modernize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just so colonized in our minds,'' she said. ``Why do we
have to follow the West like bloody morons?''

UN MOVES TO HELP WOMEN CUT RISK OF HAVING AIDS BABIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Opening a new front in the global fight against AIDS,
UN officials said Monday they would offer 30,000 pregnant women in
developing nations access to a drug regimen recently proven to cut
their risk of transmitting the AIDS virus to their babies.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million program, which will treat its initial patients
late this year, marks the first concerted effort to extend
sophisticated AIDS treatments to the world's poorest countries,
home to 90 percent of the 30.6 milion people who harbor the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The program _ which US Surgeon General David Satcher said the
Clinton administration would support with a level of funding he
would not disclose _ will prevent only a tiny fraction of the
540,000 new cases of newborn HIV infection that arise each year in
the developing nations of Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   However, UN officials and health officials from various nations
see the program as an opening wedge in an effort to bring the
benefits of AIDS research to the nations most grimly beset by the
17-year-old epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the crucial point,'' Bernard Kouchner, France's health
minister, said. ``We must start on the issue of HIV transmission
from mother to child.''
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, Satcher and Kouchner said, the new program will
go beyond the attempt to chip away at mother-to-child transmission
of HIV. It will also make a start at providing infected mothers
with long-term anti-HIV drug treatments of the type that have
recently transformed AIDS care in rich nations.
</P>
<P>
   Satcher said the Clinton administration is consulting with the
Ivory Coast in West Africa to mount a program that would offer
sophisticated antiviral treatments to infected women there after
delivery. He said he hopes such US-funded programs will be launched
in several nations.
</P>
<P>
   Without sustained treatment for HIV-infected mothers, critics
say, programs aimed merely at preventing newborn HIV infections
could turn into ``orphan factories.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very difficult to let the mother die after she has
delivered her baby,'' Kouchner said. ``We will take care of women
after delivery, starting with a few hundred in the first three
sites'' of the mother-child prevention program.
</P>
<P>
   The new program to prevent mother-child HIV transmission will be
funded by an International Solidarity Fund spearheaded by France,
with the support of European Union nations, and possibly the US and
World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner said he is increasingly optimistic about raising the $4
million in start-up funds even though ``some nations are very
reluctant'' to contribute. ``I talked last week to Donna Shalala,''
the US secretary of health and human services, Kouchner said. ``She
said she was interested but I haven't gotten any dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the pregnancy-focused program will be set up in 30
sites around the world, including Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Thailand,
and Uganda. In those countries, recent studies showed that
mother-child HIV transmission can be cut in half with a short
course of the drug AZT administered in the final three weeks of
pregnancy and during labor.
</P>
<P>
   With price cuts for AZT announced in March by its manufacturer,
Glaxo Wellcome, the short course will cost about $50 to provide the
drug to each expectant mother. By contrast, the longer-duration
treatment that has become standard in North America and Europe runs
$600 to $800.
</P>
<P>
   The total cost of treatment in developing nations will be about
$120 per case, including the cost of HIV testing to identify which
pregnant women carry the virus, counseling women about the
implications of testing and treatment, and access to infant formula
to avoid the risk of infants' infection through breast feeding.
</P>
<P>
   It might cost $180 million to treat the approximately 1.5

year. Such a program, if it could reach every infected woman, might
prevent HIV infection in 270,000 infants.

FED EXPECTED TO HOLD BACK ON A RATE INCREASE FOR NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The most militant inflation fighters at the Federal
Reserve Board will have plenty to fret about when the central bank
meets Tuesday and Wednesday to consider whether to raise interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew at a sizzling 5.4 percent annual pace in the
first quarter. The unemployment rate, at 4.3 percent, is the lowest
since 1970. Consumer price inflation, while still low, is
increasing, and the Clinton administration's decision to help prop
up the Japanese yen could ameliorate the inflation-fighting effects
of the strong dollar, which has helped keep import prices down.
</P>
<P>
   The strength in the stock market has left consumers feeling
flush and confident. On Monday the Commerce Department reported new
home sales in May hit a record.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, such signals of strong growth and rising
inflation pressures might normally be enough to lead the Federal
Reserve to nudge rates up. But they will almost certainly be
overshadowed during the Fed meeting by a patient, pragmatic
approach championed by Alan Greenspan, the central bank's chairman.
After the meeting adjourns, the Fed is expected to announce it is
holding interest rates steady, at least until its next meeting on
Aug. 18, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of the pragmatists' argument is the belief that
growth is already slowing towards a noninflationary rate because of
the financial crisis in Asia and perhaps the strike that has nearly
shut down General Motors. Moreover, raising rates now could further
destabilize Asia and emerging economies from Russia to Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the American economy has exhibited a surprising
ability for several years to grow at robust rates without setting
off inflationary wage and price spirals. Greenspan himself even put
aside the dour mien that has long been his trademark and a few
weeks ago proclaimed the economy to be just about the best he had
ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   David Orr, the chief economist at First Union Corp.'s capital
markets group, said the economy was shifting from a Goldilocks
stage _ neither too hot nor too cold _ into a Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde stage in which it exhibited contradictory characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's crisis has had a substantial impact on farmers and
manufacturers that export chemicals, electrical equipment, lumber
and textiles, he said, helping to slow the overall economy's growth
to 2 percent or less this spring and summer.
</P>
<P>
   But at the same time, he said, consumer spending remains strong,
incomes continue to grow and business investment in computers and
other equipment remains heavy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see Alan Greenspan raising rates unless the
manufacturing sector shows some rebound, which I don't see
happening this year,'' Orr said. ``On the other hand, the
fundamentals of private sector domestic demand are just so solid
that demand is really exceeding supply in areas like housing, an
awful lot of service and retail areas and commercial construction.
So inflation is going up in those areas.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, Orr said, is to keep the Fed trapped between
conflicting forces, with monetary policy on hold until inflation
becomes a clear threat or the economy becomes so sluggish that it
needs to be reinvigorated by a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our bet is that the strength of underlying U.S. domestic
demand prevails, and that by spring of next year, or something of
that order, they do raise rates,'' Orr said. ``But it's a close
bet.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The best clues to how the Fed is handling the situation could
come not in the expected terse announcement Wednesday that the
Federal Open Market Committee has left rates unchanged, but in the
minutes, to be released on Thursday, of the committee's May 19
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   At the previous meeting, on March 31, the Fed left rates
unchanged but formally signaled that it expected the next move on
interest rates to be upward _ in essence an early warning to the
markets that if the expected slowdown in growth did not happen it
would probably tighten policy.
</P>
<P>
   The May 19 minutes will reveal whether that policy bias was left
in place. It will provide a synopsis of the debate between the
pragmatists on the committee and those members who see inflation as
more of an immediate threat.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among the inflation hawks is Jerry Jordan, the
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, who alone among
the committee's 12 members voted to raise rates at the March 31
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's vote was based in part on his concern about the rapid
growth in the money supply, a development that has a number of
other Fed officials worried. Money supply growth has fallen out of
favor in the last decade as a proxy for inflation pressures, but
some economists are now arguing that the link has been at least
partly re-established.
</P>
<P>
   Economists said they would be closely watching Thursday's
employment report, which will provide the clearest look yet at
whether growth began slowing in earnest in June.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists expect a slight uptick in the unemployment rate,
to 4.4 percent, and a slowdown in job creation, to a little more
than 200,000 in June from 296,000 in May. &QL;

TAINTED GALVESTON BAY OYSTERS SICKEN 107 PEOPLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif., Colo., Fla., La., N.M.) 
 
By KEVIN MORAN

<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ The number of people reported to be ill from
bacteria in raw Galveston Bay oysters had more than doubled Monday,
and state health officials said more cases were being reported.
</P>
<P>
   The total was up to 107 cases, 18 of them involving people who
had eaten the raw Galveston Bay oysters in Florida restaurants,
said Texas Department of Health spokesman Doug McBride. The other
89 cases involved people who had eaten them in Texas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials had recorded 51 cases Friday after issuing
bulletins about the oysters, tainted by a bacterium called Vibrio
parahaemolyticus. Wholesalers were tracking down shipments _ to
restaurants around Texas and in California, Colorado, Florida,
Louisiana and New Mexico _ and warning them not to serve the
shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak of illness is the second-largest of its kind in the
nation's history. Last year, 208 people in the Pacific Northwest
fell ill from eating oysters tainted with the bacterium and one
person died, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The bacterium's development is attributed to warm, unusually
salty water around oyster beds in Galveston Bay. Officials said
they hope the infusion of fresh water from last weekend's rains
will help prevent more oysters from becoming contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Fishermen who lease state-controlled oyster beds in the bay have
stopped harvesting oysters there at least until next week while
tests are conducted to see if the oysters are contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters from seven of the 43 beds where oysters have been
harvested recently are known to have caused illnesses since early
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms from consuming foods tainted with Vibrio
parahaemolyticus include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, nausea, fever,
vomiting and headache, health officials said. The bacterium rarely
causes death, they said, but it can be dangerous to people who have
liver problems or weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The state health department still was receiving calls Monday
from health officials who have treated people who appeared to be
suffering from the illness and people who have heard about the
outbreak and believe they were victims, McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   People who have suffered symptoms within a day or two of eating
raw oysters are asked to report the illness to state officials by
calling 1-888-883-9997.
</P>
<P>
   People who develop such symptoms after eating oysters should see
a physician, the officials said.

   NEW YORK _ Leopards may not be able to change their spots, but
habits can change their nuns.
</P>
<P>
   So today's news is that the Little Sisters of Hoboken, those
cowled cutups and wimpled wiseacres who exemplified the spirit of
mischief on New York stages for nearly a decade in ``Nunsense,''
have returned. But only after a sex change.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   The five sisters who opened the other day in a revival of the
show are men. The new version, written and directed once again by
Dan Goggin, goes by the title ``Nunsense A-Men!'' But it is still
very much the anything-for-a-laugh grab bag of jokes and songs
wrapped in a see-through plot that opened at the Cherry Lane
Theater in December 1985 and didn't give up the ghost until
February 1995 at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater after 3,672
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a great show? No. Is it fun? Definitely yes, especially
for those who can bear with the gags, which run from the inane
(``How do you get down off a duck?'' ``How did you get up there in
the first place?'') to the profane (double-entendres about names
like John) to the punny (``Hello, Dalai Lama'') and the funny (a
raucous recipe for turkey stuffing using unpopped corn). The show
gathers momentum as it proceeds, and by its conclusion it manages
to impress if not with its sophistication then with the energy and
talent of its cast and its relentless commitment to the spirit of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Does it make a difference that the nuns are played by men? Not
in the least. It's a one-joke joke, and after Sister Mary Amnesia
makes her entrance, looking seven feet tall, and the other four
sisters quickly establish their characters, ``Nunsense A-Men!''
wisely moves on to the funny business at hand, and the fine actors
take advantage of the show's many opportunities to display their
talents.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is a genuine blessing. It is led by David Titus as that
porky pixie Sister Mary Regina, the Reverend Mother and resident
mugger, with plenty of help. Lothair Eaton plays Sister Mary
Hubert, the ambitious deputy whose lack of humility led her to
dream of turning the Little Sisters of Hoboken into the Big Sisters
of Newark. Greg White is the sweet, silly Sister Mary Amnesia, who
makes her loss of memory memorable and turns out to be a blessing
in disguise. Doan Mackenzie is the innocent-looking novice Sister
Mary Leo, a not-so-secret balletomane. And Danny Vaccaro is Sister
Robert Anne, right out of Canarsie and yearning for a leading role
in the sisters' fund-raising show.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness that all these performers can act, sing, dance
and put over a joke, because as anyone familiar with ``Nunsense''
knows, the airheaded plot revolves around the sisters' efforts to
raise money by putting on a show.
</P>
<P>
   It seems that the order's chef, Sister Julia, Child of God,
managed to send 52 of its sisters heavenward, chilled out by means
of a batch of vichyssoise tainted with botulism. Forty-eight were
buried before Sister Mary Regina blew the order's remaining money
on a VCR, so four are still literally on ice in the freezer while
the question of paying for their burial remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   So, under the musical direction of Leo P. Carusone, with songs
that range from the tender to the hand-clapping torrid, the show
goes on, with everything from ``The Dying Nun Ballet'' to a
ventriloquist act with a nun dummy to gags about ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' ``Show Boat'' and ``Sunset Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing at the 47th Street Theater, between heaven and Hell's
Kitchen, ``Nunsense A-Men!'' may not please the rigidly reverent,
but those who stick around long enough will find a fair share of
earthly rewards.

   NEW YORK _ At the vast cultural banquet that is New York, try to
imagine a sorbet course flavored with something exotic, like loco
weed. Anyone who can do that will be on the way to appreciating the
wacky and wise, melodic and mischievous summertime refreshment
being served at the New York Theater Workshop under the title
``Love's Fowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Before retiring the imagination to a padded retreat, try to
visualize this: the tale of Chicken Little, that immemorial prophet
of doom, resurrected in the form of yet another sequel to popular
fiction (imagine ``Gone With the Wind'' and ``Scarlett''). Now,
while planting tongue in cheek and maintaining a firm grip on
reason (try two hands), imagine this story of the foolish fowl,
this ``Recherche du Temps Perdue,'' told by means of puppets made
of wooden clothespins. Well, not so much told as sung, because
``Love's Fowl'' is an opera. And like so many fine operas, it is
sung in Italian, which transforms Chicken Little into La Pulcina
Piccola, which is already music to the ears.
</P>
<P>
   But since the story _ with mass murder, crime passionel, a
sensational trial, tragic love, liaisons dangereuses, show
business, shipwreck on the high seas, adventure on the lone prairie
and an excursion into the spirit world beyond the grave _ is as
lurid as the fever dream of a talk show host, clearly this is
material for the screen.
</P>
<P>
   But can a single screen hold so rich a helping of the human _
make that chicken _ comedy? Of course not. On the stage, ``Love's
Fowl'' spills over onto three screens. One carries an English
translation of the Italian lyrics. The two others carry the
magnified images of the puppets manipulated by Susan J. Vitucci,
who wrote the canny and clever libretto and sings to the sprightly
music (and occasional voice) of Henry Krieger, composer of
``Dreamgirls,'' ``Side Show'' and ``The Tap Dance Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``Love's Fowl'' focuses on the post-``sky-is-falling''
adventures of the plucky chicken, it takes La Pulcina Piccola from
her native (and deadly) barnyard into the large world. There,
pummeled by the drumstick of fate, this yellow puffball has a
succession of heartbreaking loves with the likes of Cock Robin and
the Chicken of the Sea, and stars in works like ``Richard III''
while frequently finding herself, as she puts it, ``in a fine stew
for a chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   With its combination of childish figures and supermarket tabloid
content filtered through talented and sophisticated theatrical
sensibilities, ``Love's Fowl,'' running through July 9, is a cool
way to spend a summer evening. It's simultaneously silly and smart
and practically guaranteed to put a smile on the face of all but
the most determined grouch. And it's barely an hour long.

   Nancy Wheeler was home in her trailer by a trickle of a creek in
Elkview, W.Va., when the weather hit on Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear it or see it or nothing,'' Ms. Wheeler said.
``The water just came all at once. I got out of my trailer five to
10 minutes before it floated off. It just went right down the
stream and then busted apart.''
</P>
<P>
   But the storm that savaged the middle and eastern parts of the
country over the weekend and on Monday had worse in store for Ms.
Wheeler, 50, who has lived her entire life in this small town just
northwest of Charleston. As she rushed over to the trailer where
her son and daughter-in-law lived, the predatory current swept the
couple's four-month-old son out of his mother's arms. The baby,
Dakota Chyan Taylor, still has not been found and is presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was up over my neck and I went under twice, and I was
looking for my grandson,'' Ms. Wheeler said on Monday from a school
where she and other families were being sheltered and fed. ``I
pulled myself up by some weeds and I lost him. I tried to look for
him and I just couldn't find him.''
</P>
<P>
   A maelstrom of wet and violent weather has lashed across the
Midwest, Northeast and Middle Atlantic states in the last few days,
leaving more than 20 people dead or missing. Floods wrought
devastation from Wisconsin to West Virginia, Indiana to Vermont. A
tornado and heavy rains battered Ohio. And lightning strikes over
the weekend killed a Maryland girl, a camper in upstate New York
and a 56-year-old farmer in Meire Grove, Minn., who had been
turning over matted hay with a pitchfork.
</P>
<P>
   Rain also fell in parts of Florida, where Vice President Al Gore
was visiting areas affected by drought-induced wildfires that have
charred 237,000 acres since Memorial Day, and more rain was
predicted in coming days. But officials said that it did not appear
sufficient to offset the danger of further fires.
</P>
<P>
   In several states, including Ohio and West Virginia on Monday,
people braced for pounding from another storm predicted to pass
through Monday night or Tuesday. Meanwhile, across the region, the
National Guard and state transportation and emergency management
teams were searching for the missing, clearing out fallen trees and
houses, and trying to restore electricity and water to tens of
thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real toad-choker of a storm,'' said D.R. Smith, the
emergency services director in Wood County, W.Va., near the Ohio
border, where about two dozen homes remained completely surrounded
by water on Monday. ``It rained pretty doggone hard up until this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Floods dislodged about 35 mobile homes from a trailer park near
Parkersburg on Sunday, which floated away with about 80 people
inside them, Smith said. The volunteer fire department chased after
them on boats and jet skis, plucking people out while the homes
were sailing by.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most devastation that this area has ever had, as
far as I can remember,'' said Capt. Larry Sims of the Muskingum
County Sheriff's Department in southeastern Ohio, part of an area
that got up to nine inches of rain Sunday and overnight Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest death toll from the storms so far has been in Ohio,
with 11 people killed by floods or tornadoes. On Monday, Gov.
George Voinovich increased to 24 the number of central and
southeastern Ohio counties placed under a state of emergency.
Weather conditions were so bad that the governor could not even
visit some of the damaged areas on Monday, where 9,000 people have
been put out of their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just recovered the last body five minutes ago,'' said
Sheriff Landon Smith of Noble County, Ohio, where six people died,
``five drowning victims and one from a tornado.''
</P>
<P>
   An elderly couple from Caldwell, Frank and Marie Hardesty, 90
and 89 years old, were killed when their home was ``washed away
with them in it,'' the sheriff said. ``The home was totally
destroyed. There were just pieces laying everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   A 71-year-old man, Edward Granger of Caldwell, drowned in his
car. And on Monday afternoon, authorities found the body of
31-year-old Michael Clark, whom they had been searching for since
Saturday night, when his wife, Brenda, and 6-year-old daughter,
Brittany, were rescued, after they were found clinging to trees.
</P>
<P>
   In four Ohio counties, public water systems were crippled and
the National Guard was hauling in water in tankers and bottles. In
the town of Cambridge, more than 200 residents of a nursing home
were being moved to a hospital for safety and the state mental
hospital there was being evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   In Vermont, where seething floods had pummeled mobile homes,
ripped through bridges and roads, and trapped people in trees and
on rooftops, Gov. Howard Dean declared a state of emergency in nine
communities in four counties and said on Monday that he would seek
federal help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' the governor said Sunday as he flew over
his state's midsection. ``The personal losses in these homes is
just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardest hit were towns in the Mad River Valley, where a large
music festival at the Sugarbush ski resort were called off, with
hundreds of concert-goers turned back by police at barricarded
roads. About a dozen roads were closed, including parts of Route
100, a major north-south artery.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, a man died after being sucked into a culvert
he was trying to clear of debris. In Wisconsin, a 35-year-old man
was missing after his boat stalled an plunged over a dam on Lake
Arbutus. In Minnesota, two were dead and one was missing. And three
people were dead as a result of weekend storms in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana on Monday, eight bridges in Owen County were
uprooted, causing an estimated $5 million dollars in damage.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the Ohio and West Virginia communities along either side of
the swollen Ohio River seemed to suffer the most. In West Virginia,
floods and mudslides were so severe that the American Red Cross
opened seven emergency shelters in Wood, Jackson and Kanawha
counties for storm evacuees. Gov. Cecil Underwood toured the worst
areas and named 24 counties state disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
   In Clendenin, one of the hardest hit towns where nearly eight
inches of rain fell in two days, rescue crews in boats were
floating door to door on Monday, assisting or evacuating residents.
Kent Carper, a county commissioner in Kanawha County, said that 50
homes were destroyed, about 25 were severely damaged and about 15
bridges were submerged. On Sunday, a congressman, Rep. Bob Wise, a
Democrat, was trapped in his home for eight hours until the water
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ground is already saturated and the little tributaries
have nowhere to dump their water so they become rivers,'' Carper
said. ``It just wiped out houses.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in Kanawha County that Ms. Wheeler's grandson was pulled
into the vicious water. And a blind man in his wheelchair was
whisked off his front porch, where relatives had placed him while
they gathered his belongings and prepared to evacuate the house.
Another man suffered a heart attack in Clendenin and died because
an ambulance could not get to his house for nearly five hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is just horrible,'' Ms. Wheeler said. ``I lost
everything I had.''

SAMPSON RESIGNS; QUEIROS SEEN AS POSSIBLE SUCCESSOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS   AND FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Sampson, who directed the US men's soccer team to a
contentious last-place finish in the World Cup, jumped before he
was pushed Monday morning, resigning as head coach after three
years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We at the federation thank Steve for his tremendous service to
our national team program and to soccer in the USA,'' US Soccer
Federation president Alan Rothenberg said in a statement after
Sampson told him he was leaving during a breakfast meeting in
Paris. ``His tireless work has helped advance our sport and on
balance it was an era of growth. I compliment him on his many
achievements with our team.'' Neither Sampson, who was returning to
the United States with his wife and son, nor Rothenberg were
available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who was an assistant under Bora Milutinovic on the 1994
team, was the fifth coach (along with Saudi Arabia's Carlos Alberto
Parreira, South Korea's Cha Bum Kun, Tunisia's Henri Kasperczak,
and Japan's Takeshi Okada) to resign or be fired during the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   One strong candidate as a possible successor to Sampson is
Carlos Queiros, who was hired by the US Soccer Federation to
evaluate the system. At the time, many believed he was being
positioned to take over for Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   But Queiros, formerly national team coach of Portugal, said
Monday from Florida that he has not been offered the position.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would be interested, Queiros said: ``To be
interested in something is one thing. For that thing to be a
possiblility is another.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the 41-year-old Sampson had the best winning percentage
of any coach in US soccer history, directed the team to its third
straight Cup appearance and produced an historic victory over world
champion Brazil in this year's Gold Cup, his tenure had always been
marked by uncertainty. He was given the job after Milutinovic was
let go in 1995 because the squad had played well under him as
interim coach but also because more experienced foreign coaches
were unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson was on thin ice after the US was tied by Jamaica at home
in a critical qualifying match last fall and wasn't reaffirmed
until the squad had already qualified. Though a number of veteran
players had pushed to have him kept on for the Cup, their attitude
changed after Sampson dumped captain John Harkes from the squad in
April and began plugging promising but inexperienced players into
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   After the Americans were eliminated from the tournament after
losses to Germany and Iran, several veterans, including Tab Ramos,
Eric Wynalda, and Alexi Lalas who were seeing reduced or no playing
time made no secret of their unhappiness with Sampson. After the
final loss to Yugoslavia, when Ramos never got off the bench, he
vowed he would never play for Sampson again.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who had said repeatedly that he would start whomever he
felt were the best 11 players, had refrained from answering the
veterans' criticism in public. But he lashed back after Ramos and
others blamed him for the squad's poor showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's a sense of frustration that international
careers are coming to an end and they needed a scapegoat,'' Sampson
had said last week. ``It's unfair it was pointed at me, the
individual who stuck with them for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   New England Revolution coach Thomas Rongen, who served as an
assistant on the US team, feels that Sampson is being made a
scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a very unfortunate chain of events which lead up to
this,'' Rongen said. ``Something I don't think Steve deserves.
Considering his track record, he has been the most successful coach
in the national team's history. He put a team on the field that we
can all be proud of, something that we can build from. For us to
think that we had a great chance to go to the second round was
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at who's still playing. Not one team from the CONCACAF
region, not one from the Oceanic region, not one African team. It's
all European and Latin American teams still playing. To say that
Steve failed because of those three losses was grossly unfair. We
didn't take a step back, it was just a lost opportunity to showcase
our talents.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Rothenberg had said he wouldn't decide on Sampson's fate
for another month and Sampson had said he had no intention of
quitting (``I worked too hard for this. I'm not going to let one or
two individuals control my own life.''), he resigned just three
days after the players left for home.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said in his statement that a ``thorough process for
hiring a national team coach'' would be launched but gave no
timetable for naming a successor. ``We have a clean blackboard, so
to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Rongen, Sampson's successor should have long- term
vision that coincides with Project 2010, whose aim is to have the
United States positioned to host and win the World Cup in 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has got to be someone that the players respect,'' Rongen
said. ``Someone that understands the American athlete, and the
American environment. That coach needs to be someone along the
footsteps of Steve, who was always concerned about the youth
development.''
</P>
<P>
   Queiros has long had connections with the US. He coached
Portugal in the US Cup in 1992, then went to Sporting Clube de
Portugal, and in 1996 to the New York/New Jersey MetroStars. He
also coached Portugal to World championships in the Under-17 and
Under-20 categories. He has been evaluating the USSF and the MLS in
recent months.

SERBIANS UNLEASH SERIES OF HEAVY ATTACKS AGAINST ALBANIAN
SEPARATISTS

<P>
   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia _ Thousands of Serb special police units
and troops, backed by artillery and tanks, launched a series of
attacks against separatist rebel positions on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy armored personnel carriers unleashed volleys at trenches
and checkpoints held by lightly armed Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas in the mining town of Belacevac, six miles west of
Pristina, the provincial capital. Serb gunners also attacked
Lapushnik, where rebels have barricaded the main road leading from
Pristina to Pec.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks and jeeps, packed with soldiers in green-camouflage
battle dress sped to the two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbians reported that an 8-year-old ethnic Albanian boy had
been killed and a man wounded. More than 8,000 people were forced
to flee their homes in Belacevac and take refuge in nearby woods.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats say the attacks end the latest diplomatic
effort to negotiate a cease-fire and could see the fighting spread
to new areas, including Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs believe this is the final offensive,'' said a
Western military observer. ``But this is the third attempt since
March by the Serbian security forces to wipe out the rebels. Each
attempt has only brought an escalation of the fighting. So will
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   From the top of a 50-foot slag heap at the southern edge of
Belacevac on Monday drifting clouds of charcoal-colored smoke could
be seen spiraling up from burning houses in the neighboring village
of Hade. Armored vehicles could also be seen moving swiftly along
the town's deserted streets. Rifle fire and mortar rounds
reverberated across hay fields.
</P>
<P>
   At a Serb police checkpoint about a mile outside Lapushnik, a
hamlet a mile north of Negrovce, houses were afire and explosions
could be heard. A barricade of cars and cement blocks at Lapushnik,
manned by rebel fighters with rocket-propelled grenades, blocks the
road to Pec and has cut off the Serb-held town of Kijevo for seven
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   American envoy Richard Holbrooke, who spent four days last week
trying to broker a cease-fire in Kosovo, called Kijevo ``the most
dangerous place in Europe,'' warning that a Serb effort to push
into the town and free it from rebel encirclement could lead to ``a
general war.''
</P>
<P>
   The police closed the main road from Pristina to Pec soon after
dawn. Policemen on the road to Belacevac near Obilic, northwest of
Pristina, were joined by an angry collection of heavily armed Serb
civilians, many of whom said they had been pushed out of their
homes by the rebels in recent days. The Serbs, who jeered foreign
reporters, appeared to be gathering to enter the mining town after
the assault by the military and the police. Streams of residents
were fleeing the fighting on foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is war,'' said one elderly woman, who did not want to give
her name, as she clutched a small nylon bag with a few belongings.
``We have become Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Belgrade to make a push against rebel positions
follows efforts by the United States to broker a cease-fire accord
and halt the fighting that erupted in the Serbian province in
March. But neither Belgrade nor the rebel army, which controls
about 40 percent of the province, were willing to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has threatened to carry out air strikes if Belgrade does
not withdraw its forces and end attacks, but there was no immediate
indication that this latest assault would lead to intervention.
There is also a concern among diplomats that continued fighting
could set off a wider regional war that would draw in Albania and
Macedonia, which has a restive ethnic Albanian minority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In March, Serb forces surrounded an area known as the Drenica
triangle where rebel bands, numbering no more than a couple of
hundred, operated with impunity. The special police shelled
villages like Prekaz into rubble and killed over 80 people, more
than half of them women, small children, and the elderly. The
attack produced a province-wide rebellion, ending the peaceful
resistance movement led by the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of fighters have since flocked to the rebel movement
and tons of weapons and ammunition have been ferried by pack horses
over the border from northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago Serb forces moved again in force against villages
along the border with northern Albania, pounding homes into rubble
and displacing some 80,000 people. Streams of refugees fled into
Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to Montenegro, Christopher Hill, who is
trying to negotiate between the ethnic Albanian leadership and
Belgrade, met on Monday with the president of Yugoslavia, Slobodan
Milosevic, and with ethnic Albanian leaders in Pristina. Hill and
Holbrooke had hoped to get the rebels to remove barricades along
main roads and use the move to hold off a massive Serb assault. The
rebels, however, refused to consider the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that after the rebels suffer some serious losses
they will be in the mood to negotiate,'' said a Western diplomat,
``but for now they seem to want to fight. There is little we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   There were signs over the past few days that a huge
counter-insurgency sweep was being planned. The Serbs, who are
spending over $2 million a day to keep forces deployed in Kosovo,
moved about 50 tracked armored vehicles into positions around
Belacevac on Saturday morning and have deployed hundreds of
reinforcements in the province. Serb soldiers have also set up
anti-aircraft batteries around the airport and on hilltops in case
of a NATO air attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, tense groups of Serb soldiers fired at a
barricade made out of old, rusted mine equipment set up and manned
by rebel soldiers in Belacevac.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels took over the huge open pit coal mine last week and
kidnapped several Serb mine workers, halting all mine production.
</P>
<P>
   Belacevac and a neighboring mine, Dobroselo, provide the coal to
power two massive electric generating plants at Obilic. The plants
supply power to Kosovo, parts of Serbia and Macedonia. Huge
conveyor belts, now idle, channeled the coal to the plant from
Belacevac.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the mine was one of the most flagrant challenges
to Belgrade's authority. It saw guerrillas, often in berets and
black uniforms, checking documents of passing cars within a half a
mile of a sprawling army base with the city skyline behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there is an attack coming,'' said a bearded rebel on
Sunday night, ``and we have moved our forces into the hills to
respond. Don't worry, the war is far from over. This is only the
beginning. We will see you in Pristina.''

 &HT;    Tests reveal identity of remains from Unknowns tomb
 &HT;    By Ron Martz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Pat Blassie of Marietta, Ga., a long and painful year of
uncertainty about her brother lost more than 26 years ago in
Vietnam appears to be over.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon would not officially confirm Monday that remains
exhumed May 14 from the Tomb of the Unknowns in Arlington National
Cemetery and subjected to rigorous DNA testing are those of Air
Force 1st Lt. Michael Blassie.
</P>
<P>
   But a telephone call to the family of another serviceman
officials thought might have been in the tomb indicated the remains
are Blassie's.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon official ``just said they had got the results back
and that the body was Blassie's,'' The Associated Press quoted
Althea Strobridge, mother of Army helicopter pilot Capt. Rodney
Strobridge, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said an announcement on the identification is
expected today.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Pat Blassie, a communications specialist, nor members of
her family in St. Louis, could be reached for comment Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But Blassie said last month that family members, all of whom
pushed for exhumation and DNA testing, had agreed if the remains
proved to be those of Michael they wanted him buried in a national
cemetery in St. Louis rather than in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to bring him home. We believe he deserves that,''
Blassie said at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The Blassies believed for more than a year that the remains
buried in the tomb since 1985 were Michael's. Government documents
and other information they obtained last year through the efforts
of a North Carolina veteran activist helped convince them.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Blassie's A-37 attack jet was shot down in May 1972 in a
battle about 80 miles north of Saigon. He was originally listed as
missing in action, but his status was later changed to killed in
action, body not recoverable.
</P>
<P>
   Unknown to family members, however, a search team recovered
physical evidence and partial remains from near the crash site that
were labeled ``BTB (Believed to Be) Blassie.'' The physical
evidence included his identification card and a piece of his flight
suit.
</P>
<P>
   But for reasons that are still unclear to the Blassies, the
``BTB Blassie'' designation was removed in 1980 and the remains
were among four from the Vietnam era later considered for interment
at the Tomb of the Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   Several family members, including Michael's mother, Jean,
provided DNA samples for the test comparison.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how long it might be before the Pentagon replaces
Blassie's remains with those of an unidentified serviceman from the
Vietnam War. Although several sets of remains are still
unidentified in a laboratory in Hawaii, advances in DNA testing
might render the term ``unknown'' obsolete.

hundred, operated with impunity. The special police shelled
villages like Prekaz into rubble and killed over 80 people, more
than half of them women, small children, and the elderly. The
attack produced a province-wide rebellion, ending the peaceful
resistance movement led by the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of fighters have since flocked to the rebel movement
and tons of weapons and ammunition have been ferried by pack horses
over the border from northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago Serb forces moved again in force against villages
along the border with northern Albania, pounding homes into rubble
and displacing some 80,000 people. Streams of refugees fled into
Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to Montenegro, Christopher Hill, who is
trying to negotiate between the ethnic Albanian leadership and
Belgrade, met on Monday with the president of Yugoslavia, Slobodan
Milosevic, and with ethnic Albanian leaders in Pristina. Hill and
Holbrooke had hoped to get the rebels to remove barricades along
main roads and use the move to hold off a massive Serb assault. The
rebels, however, refused to consider the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that after the rebels suffer some serious losses
they will be in the mood to negotiate,'' said a Western diplomat,
``but for now they seem to want to fight. There is little we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   There were signs over the past few days that a huge
counter-insurgency sweep was being planned. The Serbs, who are
spending over $2 million a day to keep forces deployed in Kosovo,
moved about 50 tracked armored vehicles into positions around
Belacevac on Saturday morning and have deployed hundreds of
reinforcements in the province. Serb soldiers have also set up
anti-aircraft batteries around the airport and on hilltops in case
of a NATO air attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, tense groups of Serb soldiers fired at a
barricade made out of old, rusted mine equipment set up and manned
by rebel soldiers in Belacevac.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels took over the huge open pit coal mine last week and
kidnapped several Serb mine workers, halting all mine production.
</P>
<P>
   Belacevac and a neighboring mine, Dobroselo, provide the coal to
power two massive electric generating plants at Obilic. The plants
supply power to Kosovo, parts of Serbia and Macedonia. Huge
conveyor belts, now idle, channeled the coal to the plant from
Belacevac.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the mine was one of the most flagrant challenges
to Belgrade's authority. It saw guerrillas, often in berets and
black uniforms, checking documents of passing cars within a half a
mile of a sprawling army base with the city skyline behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there is an attack coming,'' said a bearded rebel on
Sunday night, ``and we have moved our forces into the hills to
respond. Don't worry, the war is far from over. This is only the
beginning. We will see you in Pristina.''

 &HT;    Religious conservatives may decide Alabama runoff for Governor
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY _ In today's Republican runoff, incumbent Gov. Fob
James will learn whether bearing the cross of religious freedom is
enough to defeat hard-charging challenger Winton Blount.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fob James is elected, it shows that religious conservatives
are alive and well and will remain dominant even though the party
has become more diverse in general,'' said William Stewart, chair
of the political science department at the University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Elected as a Republican in 1994, James has crusaded to return
prayer to Alabama schools, which endeared him to religious
conservatives nationwide. James was elected governor as a Democrat
in 1978 and served one term. Blount, a Montgomery businessman whose
father was postmaster general under President Nixon, says James has
wasted time on religious grandstanding instead of focusing on
economic issues that have caused Alabama to lag behind its Southern
neighbors. ``This is probably a referendum on Fob James and the
image he's brought to the governor's office,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Turnout will be crucial, especially with the GOP runoff allowing
Democratic crossovers. Blount was endorsed by Birmingham Mayor
Richard Arrington, who heads a coalition of black voters typically
pledged to Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The race appears close. In a poll published Sunday, Blount drew
48 percent, James 47 percent. The poll was taken June 23-26 by
Southern Opinion Research and had a margin of error of plus or
minus five percentage points. In a five-man primary June 2, James
took 48 percent of the vote. Blount won 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, however, at least one poll has shown James opening
a lead over Blount, a potential backlash to the Arrington
endorsement, said Gerald Johnson, who has been contracted to
conduct polling for the Alabama Education Association. The AEA's
president has endorsed James.
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly will be some of that'' backlash, said Johnson,
formerly a political scientist at Auburn. ``At some level, there's
a racial reaction. ... Over the last three days, there's been a
significant move in the likely vote for Gov. James. But what is not
known is the size of the Democratic crossover vote.''

COMMENTARY: A DELICATE BALANCE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Two months after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright laid down an ultimatum to Israel to decide on a further
redeployment from the West Bank or else, neither the decision nor
the ``or else'' has appeared. Last week, in fact, Israeli papers
were running polls on whether there should be a national referendum
on whether Israel should accept the U.S. proposal for a 13 percent
withdrawal. It was like asking Israelis for their opinion about
whether the government should ask their opinion before it gives its
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, I was left with
the impression that he is ready to do a deal _ provided he can get
from the Palestinians all the political and security concessions he
feels he needs to insulate himself from the crazies in his
coalition who oppose any accord. (Polls show 63 percent of Israelis
favoring the withdrawal, so the public is ready.)
</P>
<P>
   But no deal is going to give Netanyahu, or Yasser Arafat,
everything they want. If in the end the deal on the table satisfies
Israel's basic security needs, but does not satisfy every political
need, will Netanyahu risk his coalition to push it through, or risk
the peace? No one here knows.
</P>
<P>
   I believe Netanyahu will do this deal, but only when he feels he
has no other choice. What is unusual about today, though, is that
there is a temporary equilibrium of forces that is making it
difficult for any party to force that choice. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The United States: &LR;  Back in the 1970s, Henry Kissinger was
ready to twist Golda Meir's arm to accept the 1973 disengagement
accords, and in the early 1990s James Baker was ready to twist
Yitzhak Shamir's arm to accept the Madrid peace conference. Why?
Because clear-cut overarching U.S. strategic interests were at
stake _ a global struggle with the Soviet Union and a global
struggle with Iraq. Today there are still some U.S. interests in
the peace process. But the Clinton team, because it has not
articulated any coherent post-Cold War strategic framework, can't
convincingly link any particular regional conflict with U.S.
national security, and therefore can't counter domestic pressures
to do nothing. Without a strategic logic, the Americans look like
naive do-gooders trying to break up a street brawl.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Israel: &LR;  The Israeli economy today is OK, there has been no
serious Palestinian terrorism in many months and the Labor Party
opposition has all but collapsed, so for the Israeli public there
is no urgency to make a decision. Sure, every week some senior
Israeli political figure denounces Netanyahu as a liar and
manipulator. President Ezer Weizman did it last week, and on Monday
even called for new elections. But it has no effect. It seems that
some part of Israelis likes the idea that Bibi is such a bad boy.
Better, they say, to have an Israeli bad boy deal with the bandits
on the Arab side.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jordan: &LR;  King Hussein, who has more influence with the Israeli
public than any other Arab leader does, complains privately about
Netanyahu but won't break with him. This is because the king is
worried about triggering an explosion that will scare away the
foreign investors he needs. He is worried about a Palestinian
state. And he doesn't want to admit to his domestic and Syrian
critics that his Israel alliance might have been wrong. So he stews
privately and writes Netanyahu angry letters.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Palestinians: &LR;  Also paralyzed. Arafat doesn't want to
unleash the Palestinian ``street,'' because he could lose control
and it could torch him. He also doesn't want to give a green light
to Hamas suicide bombers, because this will turn the United States
against him. So he stews and writes letters to Albright.
</P>
<P>
   So what you have, for the moment, is a negative equilibrium. But
its stability is an illusion, because it is not built on any
positive understandings, but rather on problems not solved,
promises not kept, decisions not taken and anger not vented.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, what you feel here is that even if there is a deal,
things won't really improve. Netanyahu's whole approach to the
Palestinians is based on the notion that there is no Palestinian
people, with its own interests and politics. That's why he
negotiates with America and gives the Palestinians a choice of
accepting what he is willing to offer America or taking nothing.
Even if Netanyahu is able to engineer a deal on those terms, it
will not be stable because there will be no real Palestinian
consensus underlying it, only an Israeli diktat.

 &HT;    VP visits scorched Florida
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM COAST, Fla. _ Surrounded by the burned-out ruins of several
homes and acres of blackened pine trees, Vice President Al Gore
promised federal help is on its way to fire-ravaged Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``A joint federal and state disaster recovery center will be
established in this neighborhood tomorrow,'' Gore said Monday after
visiting residents of Seminole Woods, where nearly two dozen homes
were lost in early June. ``My heart goes out to the families who
have lost their homes.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's visit came as Florida officials said they believe
firefighters are gaining the upper hand against the blazes, which
have blackened more than 230,000 acres across the state since late
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out of the woods yet, but we're getting the kind of
equipment we need to go on the offensive in attacking the fires,''
said Gov. Lawton Chiles, who accompanied Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fires have been sparked by lightning, although some
are the work of arsonists. Fires have flared in all but one of the
state's 67 counties, with the northeast section hardest-hit.
</P>
<P>
   The flames have feasted on bone-dry acres of timber and scrub,
parched by a three-month drought and some of the hottest
temperatures in Florida weather-record history. Weather forecasters
say there is no immediate help on the way. Conditions for the week
appear likely to remain dry, with some afternoon thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   The storms and accompanying lightning sometimes do more harm
than good, sparking new fires and dropping only isolated patches of
rain.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, fires threatened Jacksonville and Waldo, a small
town outside Gainesville. Now those blazes have abated and the
biggest inferno is raging in pine woods west of Daytona Beach.
Thick smoke has filled the air over parts of several surrounding
counties, obscuring roadways and leaving some people with coughs
and stinging eyes.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday afternoon, though, a moderate sea breeze off the
Atlantic blew most of the smoke away from Daytona International
Speedway, which will host the Pepsi 400 stock car race on the
Fourth of July, an event that is expected to attract hundreds of
thousands of racing enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   Gore toured fire-scarred parts of Volusia County, where 80,000
acres have burned but no homes or lives have been lost. He also
traveled to Flagler County, where several dozen homes burned in
early June.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were heartened by the attention, which included an
hourlong private meeting with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It touched me,'' said Bob March, who took Gore on a tour of
the burnt-out remains of his home. ``I really believe his heart is
in the right place and he will do all he can to see we get some
help.''
</P>
<P>
   But March and several other residents of Seminole Woods
complained that firefighters were slow to respond and only gave
last-minute evacuation orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw one firetruck in here,'' said Shawn Wilson, 35,
who saved his home with a garden hose. ``Three hours before the
fire, they told us everything was OK, and then they gave us 10
minutes to get out. Something was definitely wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore promised more federal help for fighting the fires,
including $35 million that the Federal Emergency Management Agency
has already committed for equipment, overtime and disaster
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Residents welcomed the promises, but said they hope the words
are followed by deeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been made so many promises already,'' said Jim Jones,
who lost his home and his business. ``We want to see if the end
results match his words.''

 &HT;    Poll shows most Americans believe in possibilities of UFO'sBy
Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Walter Sheets, a former police chief College Park,
Ga., saw his first UFO in the mid-'60s and has seen a slew since
then. He welcomes a new call by a distinguished group of scientists
for more research on whether space aliens have ever visited earth.
</P>
<P>
   So does Michael Hitt, a Roswell, Ga. police officer, who has
also seen some UFOs. He says the scientists' conclusion, that many
UFO sightings have never been adequately explained, is not only
obvious, but long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   If Sheets and Hit are kooks, they have a lot of company. Most of
the American public would likely agree with them, according to the
latest Southern Focus poll by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 59 percent of Southerners and 66 percent of
people outside the South think UFOs are real, or at least could be.
The poll also found that 53 percent of Southerners and 62 percent
of people outside the region think it's at least possible that
aliens have visited Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific panel, which conducted the first independent
scholarly review of UFOs in nearly three decades, published its
50-page report Monday. It argued that more research is needed
because many strange phenomena have been pooh-poohed too quickly.
It cited mysterious objects on radar, strange lights flitting in
the skies, aberrations in the workings of automobiles, skin burns
of witnesses and radiation found in vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, headed by Stanford University physicist Peter
Sturrock and made up of scientists from other major universities,
chided scholars worldwide for shying away from UFO research because
of the potential for ridicule. It noted that meteorites and even
lighting were ``originally dismissed as folk tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheets and Hitt said this new recommendation will spark
increased enthusiasm for a scheduled ``sky watch'' after dusk on
July 11, at which dozens of Georgians are expected to converge on a
``UFO hot spot'' in Troup County, Ga. The event is sponsored by the
Georgia chapter of the Mutual UFO Network, of which both men are
members.
</P>
<P>
   Hitt, 42, MUFON's state historian, said thousands of UFOs have
been sighted in Georgia. He said ``hot spots'' change every few
years and that Atlanta and military facilities in Georgia have all
been areas of alien scrutiny over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Faded Journal-Constitution archives show ``flying saucers'' have
been the subject of dozens of serious news reports since World War
II. In 1952, for example, the Constitution published a United Press
International story reporting that the U.S. military had ordered
jet pilots to take off instantly in pursuit of ``flying saucers''
reported anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, a story in the Journal, quoting officials of the North
American Defense Command, reported that it was ``very unlikely''
that a flock of UFOs sighted over Georgia could be explained away
as space junk falling to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force last year made public what it said would be its
last report on UFOs. It explained that the famous ``Roswell (N.M.)
incident'' of 1947, thought by many to be a UFO crash, was a
military experiment with high-altitude parachuting, involving
dummies. Earlier, the Pentagon launched Project Blue Book in 1952
to investigate thousands of UFO sightings and ended the research in
1969, concluding it had found no useful evidence any unexplained
phenomena constituted a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets, 49, a Vietnam combat veteran who spent 25 years as a
homicide detective before becoming police chief in College Park,
argues that Washington wants to sweep UFOs under the rug because it
fears ``if mankind were to learn about another intelligence from
elsewhere, there would be chaos in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he personally has investigated hundreds of sightings. He
said he saw his first UFO as a student in the 1960s, peering
through a telescope. He saw a ``V-shaped formation of disc-like
craft, traveling east to west, high in the sky, performing unusual
and bizarre aerial maneuvers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many sightings are made by police officers, who often
are reluctant to tell their superiors for fear of being labeled
kooks.
</P>
<P>
   Hitt said he saw his first UFO in 1969 when he took his family
to Florida to watch an Apollo moon launch. The night before
blastoff, he said, ``we saw something that looked like a shooting
star, streaking across. But then it stopped, and reversed its
course, and did this zigzag pattern for 15 seconds. I knew no one
would believe me, so I got my sister, mother and grandmother to
look, and they all saw it. It was very rapid.''
</P>
<P>
   As Georgia's historian of MUFON, a well-organized national
organization with its own web sites, he said he feels UFOs have
been visiting Earth for eons but started coming more often after
atomic bomb detonations started in 1945. He said it is ``well
documented'' that Dobbins Air Force base in Marietta, Ga. was
``buzzed'' by UFOs in 1952, the same year strange objects were
reported streaking over the White House by Washington newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, a 45-year-old LaGrange, Ga. insurance executive
and a past state director of MUFON, said he and his family _ wife
and three sons _ saw a UFO on Feb. 20, 1994, that had to be from
out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a string of bright, non-blinking Christmas tree
lights, just sitting in the sky, low on the horizon. It had a large
white light in the center, and it was revolving.''
</P>
<P>
   By arguing that UFOs definitely do exist, the MUFON men go far
beyond the new report, which only suggests more study. Many other
academics ridicule the very idea of UFOs, and say that the only
research needed is psychological: to determine why people believe.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Sparks, an expert on belief systems at Purdue University,
said his research shows that angst over the coming of a new
millennium, fed by Hollywood movies and TV shows, is fueling belief
in UFOs and other kinds of unproven phenomena, like ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to want to believe,'' he said. ``It's a general
way of coping with upheaval in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, an anthropologist at the University of Alabama,
said ``there is absolutely no archaeological evidence for UFOs,
though it would be irrational to think that in an infinite
universe, there is not other life. But it's just as irrational to
think that any of that alien life could have found Earth and would
be interested in us if they did, unless they were entomologists and
wanted to study us like bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Terry Sandbek, a clinical psychologist in California who
also specializes in behavior, said the reason people believe in
UFOs is simple: ``It's the same reason we enjoy fiction,'' he said.
``It's fun.

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Tampa Bay Devil Rays
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: Tonight and Wednesday at 7:05 p.m., Thursday at 12:35
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Tropicana Field.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV, radio: TBS will telecast tonight's game. Fox Sports South
will telecast Wednesday and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, LHP Denny Neagle (8-6,
3.48; first appearance vs. Devil Rays) vs. LHP Tony Saunders (1-8,
4.75; 3-0, 1.65 lifetime vs. Braves). Wednesday, RHP John Smoltz
(5-2, 3.77; first appearance vs. Devil Rays) vs. RHP Julio Santana
(2-1, 5.11; first appearance vs. Braves). Thursday, RHP Greg Maddux
(11-2, 1.64; first appearance vs. Devils Rays) vs. TBA.
</P>
<P>
   _ Series history: This is the first meeting between the two
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Past meetings: The Braves visited Tropicana Field in spring
training and lost. Since then, Atlanta has gone 5-0 against
expansion teams.
</P>
<P>
   _ Devil Rays leaders: Avg.: Aaron Ledesma (.317); HR _ Paul
Sorrento (12); RBI _ Fred McGriff (41); SB _ Mike Kelly and Randy
Winn (9). W _ Luis Arrojo (10); ERA _ Scott Aldred (2.19).
Strikeouts _ Arrojo (92). Saves _ Roberto Hernandez (17).
</P>
<P>
   _ Update: Tampa Bay is coming off a 2-3 road trip, scoring just
15 runs and 10 of those came in the last two games, both victories
in Philadelphia. At 37-46, the expansion Devil Rays have a better
record than seven clubs. With its 10th win of June coming Sunday,
Tampa Bay joins Florida as the only expansion teams to win 10 games
in each of their first three months of existence. . . . The D-Rays
are 5-8 in interleague play. . . . The team's 40 errors are
second-fewest in the majors only to Baltimore. . . . Tropicana
Field has not been kind to the Rays' pitching staff, which has
posted a 4.93 ERA and given up 45 home runs in 38 home games. In 42
road games, Devil Rays pitchers have a 3.84 ERA and 36 homers
allowed. . . . Ex-Brave Fred McGriff, with 10 hits in his last 23
at-bats, is breaking out of an extended slump. His home run Sunday
off Philadelphia's Mark Portugal was only his second in 52 games.
He is still batting just .234 this month. . . . The Braves last
faced lefty Tony Saunders in Game 3 of the NLCS. He had no decision
in that game, leaving in the sixth with Florida trailing 2-1, but
his 1998 performance against the Braves was extraordinary. In four
starts against Atlanta, he was 3-0 with a 1.65 ERA. Against
everyone else, he was 1-6 with a 5.57 ERA. With 54 walks in 15
starts this year, he has allowed 148 men to reach base in just 89
innings. . . . The D-Rays will not name Thursday's starter until
Thursday. Manager Larry Rothschild will choose either Luis Arrojo
or Jason Johnson. . . . On the DL: LHP Wilson Alvarez (left
shoulder tendinitis), LHP Vaughn Eshelman (left shoulder surgery),

 &HT;    Delta promotes former flight attendant to executive post
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Delta Air Lines is elevating a homegrown executive to
a top position in which she'll oversee the carrier's efforts to
improve service and more efficiently handle heavy passenger loads.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Escarra, a native Atlantan who started with Delta as a
flight attendant in 1973 and rose into upper management, was named
Monday as executive vice-president-customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Escarra becomes the highest-ranking female executive at
Atlanta's biggest corporate employer. Her appointment also bucks a
recent trend at Delta of filling top positions with outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   They include a new chief executive, chief financial officer and
marketing chief, all brought in over the past 10 months. But the
new chief executive, Leo Mullin, appears content to leave daily
operations in the hands of Delta veterans such as Escarra and her
immediate superior, Chief Operating Officer Maurice Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Escarra, a 45-year-old Georgia State University graduate, had
been senior vice president-airport customer service. She takes on
the broader role as Delta struggles to reverse a decline in its
once-lofty service image, a problem magnified by heavy passenger
loads generated by a strong economy.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Delta announced the move Monday, the American Society of
Travel Agents issued a Traveler's Bill of Rights calling for ``bare
minimum standards'' of cleanliness, courtesy and comfort for
airline passengers.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Air Transport Association, an airline trade
group, said the agents' group is upset over commission cuts and
denied wholesale service problems.
</P>
<P>
   Escarra said she believes Delta has made more progress than it
is credited for in repairing service problems created by cost cuts
in 1994 and 1995. She added the airline has accelerated plans to
refurbish aircraft interiors and has set a goal of having the best
on-time rate of any hub-and-spoke airline by 2000, which would mark
a vast improvement over its poor historical ranking. She also said
Delta soon will introduce new technology to streamline passenger
processing and cut down on long lines at airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finding ways we can manage crowds efficiently is where we will
win as far as service goes,'' Escarra said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Delta confirmed Monday that Gayle Bock, vice
president for consumer marketing, is leaving the company. No reason
was given. Bock, who'd previously worked at United Airlines, was
hired in late 1996 and was involved in Delta's switch to a new ad
agency and the ``On Top of the World'' campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She also headed the SkyMiles program and other promotions. No
successor has been named.

 &HT;    Rookie Brookings ready to get to work for Falcons
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The one concession to Keith Brooking's new status, a
sports utility vehicle loaded with all the options befitting a
soon-to-be millionaire, actually was delivered in April, two weeks
before the Atlanta Falcons made him the 12th overall selection in
the NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   That the former Georgia Tech and East Coweta High School
linebacker is tooling around town these days in a Navigator seemed
appropriate on Monday afternoon. During a press conference to
announce his contract, Brooking again demonstrated that he has
carefully plotted a course for success and that money won't alter
his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to play football and when I'm done doing that, maybe
I can sit back and think about the money I've made,'' said
Brooking, who looked as if he would readily swap his dark suit for
a pair of shoulder pads. ``I probably have more passion for the
game now than I've ever had. I think I can start, but my first goal
is just to get on the field as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dan Reeves, whose playing career came at a time when not
even Pro Bowl caliber veterans earned seven-figure salaries,
suggested that Brooking's disdain during contract negotiations for
dollar-related issues.
</P>
<P>
   Reeves lauded Brooking, agent Gary Wichard and general manager
Harold Richardson for accomplishing one of the earliest first-round
deals in club history. He also revisited a ``throwback'' theme
started shortly after Atlanta chose Brooking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's the first play of the first quarter or the last
play of the fourth quarter,'' Reeves said, ``Keith is always going
full speed.'' Before leaving for a mandatory three-day rookie
symposium in Denver, Brooking said he will begin looking for two
things upon his return _ a roomy apartment and a bank with a big
vault. He'll invest most of his team rookie-record signing bonus of
$3.8 million and seek some tangible way to help his parents, Brenda
Hembree and Harvey Brooking, both of whom attended the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Brooking's voice wavered slightly when he thanked his parents
for their sacrifices and guidance. Like her son, Hembree said the
magnitude of the ``camouflaged'' five-year deal had not yet
registered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people,'' she said, ``claim they'd play for free.
Keith loves football so much, I believe he just might.''
</P>
<P>
   That will hardly be the case. Unlike last year's 12th overall
choice, tailback Warrick Dunn of Tampa Bay, Brooking's signing
bonus is non-deferred. Of the $3.5 million bonus paid Dunn, $1.5
million was deferred to '98. Also, Dunn's contract did not include
any escalator clauses. Brooking can more than double his 2002 base
salary to $2.5 million by being voted to one Pro Bowl game.
Multiple appearances could push his salary that year to as much as
$4 million.

GARCIAPARRA'S HITLESS NUMBERS NUMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ So, maybe we have this hitting streak stuff all
backwards with Nomar Garciaparra, who has hit in 20 straight games
entering Tuesday night's interleague contest against the Montreal
Expos in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of counting the consecutive games in which he has
collected at least one hit, the conventional way baseball
record-keepers do business, maybe we should be calculating how many
games Garciaparra has gone without a hit.
</P>
<P>
   As you would guess, the number is a low one. Garciaparra has
played in 63 of the Red Sox 79 games this season. He has had at
least one hit in all but eight games in which he has played. Only
once this season, in back-to-back games against the Mets in Fenway
Park June 5 and 6, has he gone hitless in consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, incidentally, he doubled off Mets pitcher Masato
Yoshii, beginning the streak that has continued through Atlanta,
Chicago, St. Petersburg, Philadelphia and Miami and remains alive
Tuesday, when he is scheduled to face Expos ace Carlos Perez, the
lefthander who last September beat the Red Sox 1-0 and held
Garciaparra hitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can hit a lot of different pitches,'' Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams said when asked why hitting streaks are so commonplace
with Garciaparra. ``He can hit a lot of pitches that are maybe not
in the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys chase pitches that are out of the zone, and
can't handle those pitches. Nomar doesn't chase those pitches. He
hits them hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, of course, Garciaparra set an American League
rookie record by hitting in 30 straight games. He already has had
seven streaks of 10 or more games, three this season, and his
current streak makes him just one of five Red Sox players all-time
to have more than one streak of 20 games or more.
</P>
<P>
   No Red Sox player, including Hall of Famer Tris Speaker, who
holds the club record with four streaks of 20 or more, ever did it
in his first two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a viper with that bat _ (itals)shoop,
shoop,(unitals)'' Williams said, making a sound intended to
recreate a snake's tongue flickng out of its mouth with lightning
speed. ``He's a lot of fun to watch. He's an exciting player.''
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie, Garciaparra went hitless in 36 of his 153 games,
and had just one streak in which he went more than two consecutive
games without a hit. That was last May, when he went four straight
games without a hit, at a time when he was playing with a strained
left hamstring and eventually was forced to sit out a few games.
</P>
<P>
   He is coming off a weekend series in which he absolutely wore
out Marlins pitching: his first four-hit game of the season Friday
night, two more hits plus a walk and hit by pitch on Saturday, and
a double on his first at-bat Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his outs were loud, too. He flied out to the
center-field track on Friday, lined out to right on Saturday, and
lined a 420-foot out into the center-field triangle of Pro Player
Stadium on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins manager Jim Leyland joked that Garciaparra is on his
second life as a big leaguer. Reincarnation is not a typical topic
of conversation in big-league clubhouses, but Red Sox manager
Williams made exactly the same observation last season.
</P>
<P>
   Leyland was impressed at the way Garciaparra took a pitch in the
back from Marlins pitcher Matt Mantei Saturday night and went to
first base without saying a word.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he was ticked off,'' Leyland said, ``but he didn't do
any of that finger-pointing stuff. He just ran down to first base,
like an old-fashioned player.
</P>
<P>
   ``And his next time up, he hit an absolute rocket. He's a
baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   During his current streak, Garciaparra is batting .400, raising
his overall average 38 percentage points, from .278 to .316, which
ranks him third on the team, behind Mo Vaughn (.327) and Reggie
Jefferson (.323). Of his 34 hits, 16 have been for extra bases: 10
doubles, two triples and four home runs.
</P>
<P>
   And he has struck out just seven times in 85 at-bats. After
striking out 92 times in 153 games last season, Garciaparra is on
pace to drastically reduce that number this season, to just 65, a
remarkable number for such a free swinger.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Sox veterans like Vaughn and John Valentin warned
that Garciaparra would be a marked man. Last season, pitcher still
challenged him with fastballs because he was a rookie. This season,
they said, Garciaparra would see everything in a pitcher's
repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   They were right, of course, but Garciaparra adjusted. Sliders
off the plate, he has driven to right and right-center. Big-bending
curveballs, he has kept his hands back and driven them, too. Inside
fastballs on the hands, Garciaparra has fought off, and when
pitchers fail to hit their spots inside, Garciaparra has made them
pay dearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is about adjustments,'' Garciaparra said. ``First of
all, understanding the adjustments, and once you get through the
understanding process, you go through the `doing' part.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why the game is so difficult. Sometimes those
adjustments can take an awful long time.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes they don't. Any talk of streaks, and there is one
magic name: Joe DiMaggio, whose 56-game hitting streak is often
cited as baseball's unbreakable record. DiMaggio's brother,
Dominic, holds the club record of 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   Then again ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I was talking to Ted Williams,'' Red Sox GM Dan
Duquette said. ``Ted said, `I keep trying to think of who
Garciaparra reminds me of, and the one guy I keep coming back to is
Joe DiMaggio.''

 &HT;    NBA to lock out players at midnight
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several NBA teams are in such financial straits under the
current collective-bargaining agreement that not having a 1998-99
season would benefit them more than having one, commissioner David
Stern said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Stern was being dramatic, he also was outlining the reason
why the league owners will lock out the players starting at
midnight tonight. The move, also used three years ago, will prevent
teams from performing business functions _ trades, contract
negotiations, free-agent signings and summer or preseason camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners can't afford, in effect, to play the season under
the current system,'' Stern said during a teleconference. ``That's
the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners exercised their right to reopen the current deal when
it was determined that money paid out to players eclipsed by six
percentage points the 51.8 percenttrigger figure the sides agreed
on three years ago. However, nine negotiation sessions have
produced little in the way of agreement on the major financial
issues, including a revision of the rookie pay scale.
</P>
<P>
   And it stands to reason that neither side will bend much until
late in the summer, making the threat of the NBA's first work
stoppage quite realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential revenue-generating capacity is healthy,'' Stern
said. ``The system is not.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of matter is the so-called Larry Bird exception,
which allows teams over the salary cap to re-sign their own players
no matter how far it would take them over the cap.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Bird exception that allowed Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo
Mourning, Kevin Garnett and Juwan Howard to ink pacts at or
exceeding $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go back to the owners and have a situation where
there is an open-ended (contract-signing system),'' deputy
commissioner Russ Granik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting rid of the Bird exception is something we will not
allow,'' said New York Knicks center Patrick Ewing, president of
the NBA Players Association. ``That can't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   What could happen is no NBA action when no November arrives.
``That's fair and accurate,'' Stern said.
</P>
<P>
   Granik said basketball-related income for the players _
including salaries and benefits _ exceeded $1 billion for the
'97-98 season. The average salary was $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in 14, 15 years, all 29 teams taken
together will (not turn a collective profit),'' Stern said. ``About
$1 billion have gone to the players and virtually nothing to the
owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik contends that the owners made four proposals in talks
``that all involved players' salaries going up, just hopefully not
as fast,'' he said. ``The players made one proposal on April 1 and
haven't moved off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern added that arrangements have been made with TV contract
money that would allow teams to survive an entire season without
games.

GERMANY OUTCLASSES MEXICO, 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELLIER, France _ Germany's grandpas were running on vapor,
their shirts and tongues hanging out in the 90-degree heat at the
Stade de la Mosson, down, 1-0, and 15 minutes from being out of the
World Cup. We've seen this movie before, of course, and we know the
ending by heart. Goal, goal, whistle, triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``This victory confirms our way of playing,'' captain Jurgen
Klinsmann said Monday &UR;  &LR; evening, after he and his mates had torn the
heart out of the valiant Mexicans, 2-1, and advanced to the
quarterfinals. ``Going and going and fighting and fighting for 90
minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   And once again it was Klinsmann, the old prancing horse playing
in his third Cup, who carried the Germans, poking home the goal
that tied the match in the 75th minute and set the stage for Oliver
Bierhoff's winner in the 86th.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some moments when we thought, yes, we will win this
game,'' sighed Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente, whose squad had taken
the lead on Luis Hernandez's goal two minutes into the second half.
</P>
<P>
   That's what the French thought in 1982, when they had the
Germans down two goals in overtime in the semis _ and lost on
penalty kicks. That's what the Yugoslavs thought in the first round
here, when they had the Germans down two goals with 17 minutes to
play _ and got tied, 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   But the Germans, who'll meet tonight's Romania-Croatia victor
Saturday in Lyon, didn't win three Cups and reach five of the last
eight finals by not knowing how to play knockout games. They know
how to use a clock, know how to substitute, know how to turn one
lapse, one turned head, one misplaced foot into a dagger.
</P>
<P>
   So it was again Monday. Just when the Mexicans were daring to
hope, German midfielder Dietmar Hamann played a ball into the area.
Mexico's Raul Lara saw it bounce off his foot. And Klinsmann, the
33-year-old striker playing his 106th international match, pounced
on the ball like a spider and knocked it past keeper Jorge Campos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always expect to be able to get a pass and score the goal,''
said Klinsmann, who has now scored 11 in his Cup career. ``Even
down 1-0, we never lost trust and confidence. The goal freed the
team completely and gave us a new energy and dynamism.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, as the clock was running down and the Mexicans were hoping
to push Germany's band of 30-year-olds into 30 dehydrating minutes
of overtime, the Germans coolly went for the kill.
</P>
<P>
   They began by stripping the ball from Jesus Arellano in their
own end. Now came Lothar Matthaus, the 37-year-old defender playing
in his fifth Cup, cruising up the middle, ready to pull the plunger
on a little Teutonic pinball. A long, looping pass to the left side
to midfielder Michael Tarnat. Now, back across the field to striker
Ulf Kirsten, who'd come on in the 74th minute. Now, into Bierhoff
in the box for an unstoppable header, the fatal stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Thus did Mexico's magic ride end after a gallant fortnight. The
``Tris'' had arrived here a laughingstock back home after a dismal
spring tuneup series that included a four-goal loss to a Chilean
college team. Their own newspapers dubbed them the `Tritanic'. But
after they came from two goals down to tie the Belgians and the
Dutch, nobody was laughing. Certainly not the Germans, who
remembered their last meeting with the Mexicans _ 120 scoreless
minutes in the 1986 quarterfinals before the Germans won on penalty
kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Germans had only lost once before the quarterfinals
since 1938. They dominated Monday's first half, but missed two
golden chances when a diving Campos knocked aside Tarnat's blast
with one hand in the 38th minute and Bierhoff hit the crossbar with
a header with nobody home in the 40th.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost, but we did our very best,'' Hernandez said, after
German keeper Andreas Koepke had gloved his last-hope header. ``We
did the utmost.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, did Germany's grandpas, some of whom lay exhausted on
the ground after the final whistle. Going and going and fighting
and fighting for 90 minutes may be productive, but it's damned
depleting. ``The objective has been implemented,'' Berti Vogts was
saying, ``but I don't want to go through this kind of situation
again.''

 &HT;    News integrity at stake in flap over nerve gas
 &HT;    (EDS: Story moving on (e) Entertainment and (a) General News
categories.)
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``There's something happenin' here/ What it is ain't
exactly clear.''
</P>
<P>
   So sang Buffalo Springfield in its hit ``For What It's Worth,''
the song that was used as background music on the controversial CNN
report on Operation Tailwind _ and a song that describes life
inside CNN today.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is an investigation into the accuracy of
``Valley of Death,'' the report that kicked off the much-ballyhooed
``NewsStand'' magazine June 7. CNN reported that in Laos in 1970, a
covert U.S. military mission called Operation Tailwind used nerve
gas to kill American defectors and civilians. Such serious doubts
were raised about the report from many quarters _ including CNN's
own military adviser, who resigned in protest _ that Tom Johnson,
CEO of the CNN Newsgroup, hired noted First Amendment attorney
Floyd Abrams to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   As Abrams does that, no one at CNN will talk publicly about the
Tailwind report. Johnson, in his first public remarks about the
case since the controversy erupted, said Monday that Abrams' report
is due to him by July 8 and that he hopes to resolve the
controversy soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams ``is guaranteed complete independence. All notes, all
files, all source materials are available to him,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact that Johnson went outside his own company _ the
first time he's done that in his eight years leading CNN _ is not a
signal that CNN thinks its original report can stand on its own
merits.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what Abrams finds, Tailwind could be the biggest
embarrassment to CNN in its 18-year history. Johnson, known for his
integrity, will certainly order a retraction or clarification if
one is warranted, and it could be a devastating one.
</P>
<P>
   What's more likely is that the truth about whether Tailwind used
nerve gas or tear gas (as many have countered) will not be
absolutely verifiable; we're talking about a secret mission 28
years ago that people could have reason to lie about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't like there's a piece of paper we can refer to,'' was
how CNN anchor Jeff Greenfield put it.
</P>
<P>
   But even if it got the story right, CNN may not have lived up to
its own journalistic standards. There are credible allegations that
interviews with key witnesses in the Tailwind report were
selectively edited to make them seem more supportive of the nerve
gas angle than they were.
</P>
<P>
   It also appears that CNN interviewed some key players, such as
the pilots who dropped the gas, and did not include them in its
report. In fairness, CNN had evidence that nerve gas was used, but
it also had contradicting evidence that tear gas was used instead.
Several people involved in Tailwind _ the pilots, a medic _ say
they told CNN that and that CNN chose not to present it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, CNN did not include information that might have
compromised the credibility of its main source: Lt. Robert van
Buskirk, who wrote a detailed book about Tailwind in 1983 but never
mentioned nerve gas. He now says he repressed the memory for 24
years, something viewers should have been told.
</P>
<P>
   All of that would have weakened the story. But in 20/20
hindsight, it would have made CNN's position stronger today.

   ATLANTA _ ``There's something happenin' here/ What it is ain't
exactly clear.''
</P>
<P>
   So sang Buffalo Springfield in its hit ``For What It's Worth,''
the song that was used as background music on the controversial CNN
report on Operation Tailwind _ and a song that describes life
inside CNN today.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is an investigation into the accuracy of
``Valley of Death,'' the report that kicked off the much-ballyhooed
``NewsStand'' magazine June 7. CNN reported that in Laos in 1970, a
covert U.S. military mission called Operation Tailwind used nerve
gas to kill American defectors and civilians. Such serious doubts
were raised about the report from many quarters _ including CNN's
own military adviser, who resigned in protest _ that Tom Johnson,
CEO of the CNN Newsgroup, hired noted First Amendment attorney
Floyd Abrams to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   As Abrams does that, no one at CNN will talk publicly about the
Tailwind report. Johnson, in his first public remarks about the
case since the controversy erupted, said Monday that Abrams' report
is due to him by July 8 and that he hopes to resolve the
controversy soon after.
</P>
<P>
   Abrams ``is guaranteed complete independence. All notes, all
files, all source materials are available to him,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The mere fact that Johnson went outside his own company _ the
first time he's done that in his eight years leading CNN _ is not a
signal that CNN thinks its original report can stand on its own
merits.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on what Abrams finds, Tailwind could be the biggest
embarrassment to CNN in its 18-year history. Johnson, known for his
integrity, will certainly order a retraction or clarification if
one is warranted, and it could be a devastating one.
</P>
<P>
   What's more likely is that the truth about whether Tailwind used
nerve gas or tear gas (as many have countered) will not be
absolutely verifiable; we're talking about a secret mission 28
years ago that people could have reason to lie about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't like there's a piece of paper we can refer to,'' was
how CNN anchor Jeff Greenfield put it.

<P>
   But even if it got the story right, CNN may not have lived up to
its own journalistic standards. There are credible allegations that

gas angle than they were.

MORE GAYS IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A 50 percent increase of high-risk sex among gay men in
San Francisco has surprised and puzzled AIDS experts there, because
it has so far not shown up in higher rates of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
</P>
<P>
   Half of San Francisco gays who are 29 to 35 years old _ the
``second generation'' of the epidemic in a city among the hardest
hit by AIDS _ are engaging in unprotected anal intercourse,
according to a study being presented here today at the 12th World
AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The new trend is all the more striking because San Francisco's
gay community has often been cited as a model of responsible
behavior change and resulting drop in HIV transmission. Although
some studies in the early 1990s documented an upturn in risky
behaviors among younger gay males, the new data show a much higher
surge within the wider community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary that so many men in a city with such high HIV rates
are taking these risks,'' said Maria Ekstrand of the University of
California at San Francisco. ``It's riskier than Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently between 30 and 40 percent of San Francisco gay men are
HIV-positive, down from about 50 percent in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Ekstrand said she and her colleagues were stunned to discover
that the proportion of gay men 29 to 35 years old reporting
unprotected anal sex went up 50 percent from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The men were in a study of 510 gay and bisexual San Franciscans
randomly selected from the 21 census tracts in the city most
affected by AIDS. The group has been followed since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Data since 1996 show the tendency toward risky sex has
continued. A separate analysis from the same group which considers
only men who were uninfected at the beginning of each year, found
that 14 percent were engaging in unprotected receptive anal
intercourse in 1993-94, but 26 percent reported this riskiest of
behaviors this year.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, however, the rate of new HIV infections within
the study group has not been rising _ and it appears to have fallen
recently, from 1.3 percent in 1995-96 to 0.9 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers can only speculate about why riskier behaviors
have not yet translated into higher infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, said Dennis Osmond of the research group, may be
that HIV-infected men who are taking potent antiviral therapy may
be less likely to infect others because there is less virus in
their blood and seminal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible explanation, Osmond said, is that gay men are
reportedly asking prospective sexual partners if they are
HIV-positive before deciding what kind of risks to take, a practice
known as ``negotiated safety.'' However, the study shows nearly
half of those who engaged in unprotected sex did not know their
partner's HIV status.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republican politicians and strategists
say they are troubled by a wave of harsh anti-homosexual oratory
from fellow Republicans, fearing it could make the party appear
intolerant and drive out moderates and economic conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are not limited to moderate Republicans. Many
conservatives said the recent attacks on homosexuality by party
leaders, candidates and local Republican officials could spur a
reprise of the 1992 presidential campaign, when intramural
skirmishes over issues like abortion turned off the wider
electorate in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said the blunt comments, notably those made
in a recent interview by Sen. Trent Lott, R.-Miss., stemmed from a
determination among some in the party to score points with the
right wing and energize hard-core Republican voters. Lott, the
Republican leader, had likened homosexuality to kleptomania,
alcoholism and sex addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Most accept that the remarks by Lott and Rep. Dick Armey,
R-Texas, the majority leader, and many others reflect their genuine
belief that homosexuality is a sin. What has changed is that there
now is greater willingness among Republicans to speak bluntly
instead of couching their beliefs in politically agreeable
language.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., took issue with his colleagues
who contend that such statements ``might energize the party.'' He
said, ``I don't believe the party is likely to grow stronger or our
voters more numerous through attacks on minorities, whether they be
sexual minorities or religious or racial minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some Republicans conceded that their party could not
expect wide support from gay rights advocates, they said their
biggest worry would be that the comments would offend so-called
swing voters in the suburbs who are not particularly loyal to one
party or another.
</P>
<P>
   John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster, said his surveys show
the attacks on homosexuality offend voters even in the most
conservative parts of the South. ``In a lot of areas, this is not a
threat to their values and their hometowns and their communities,''
he said of homosexuals. But by raising the issue, he said, ``it
makes Republicans look out of touch, like they care about things
the voters don't care about.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said his polling also found that the anti-gay oratory
``makes Republicans look mean-spirited. Ronald Reagan may have been
``anti-gay,'' he said, ``but he wasn't somebody who disliked
people.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift appears to have been spurred by conservative leaders,
notably Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council and Dr. James
Dobson of the ``Focus on the Family'' radio talk show. The two are
pressing lawmakers to emphasize their opposition to homosexuality
as part of a social-issues agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a demand from some quarters that we aggressively
attack the homosexual community,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough,
R-Fla., one of the most conservative House members. While he said
the comments make some Republicans look like ``strident, right-wing
cartoon characters,'' Scarborough added, ``There's not a real
political downside right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough, who is 35, said his position on gay rights was
probably not much different from Lott's or others who have spoken
out. Yet he suggested there was a generational difference, and that
younger people like himself were more careful about their language
because ``we have all had friends who are gay and understand that
they are not the demons that they're made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   William Pascoe III, political director of the American
Conservative Union, also said the anti-gay oratory would benefit
Republicans. ``Anytime you have Republican leaders citing the Bible
as the foundation for their beliefs,'' he said, ``as opposed to
Democratic leaders citing the American Psychiatric Association, I
think we win.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans condemned the attacks as short-sighted.
``The Republican Party has tripped over its own shoe laces and
found itself on the defensive,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican
strategist and the former executive director of the Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In his former position, Reed was careful not to attack
homosexuals directly but instead capitalized on the issue by using
code words like the coalition's belief in the ``sanctity of
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk that Reed and other Republicans spoke of could not be
quantified. But they said they feared that the blunt comments could
cost the party not only moderates who favor homosexual rights but
quite conservative Republicans who might consider attacks on
homosexuals mean-spirited or inappropriate for a party that should
concern itself with more pressing legislative matters.
</P>
<P>
   While leading Republicans insisted that there was no
orchestrated drive in the party to go after homosexuals, there has
been a drumbeat of criticism in recent days. The most notable came
from Lott. His supporters said his remarks helped him with
conservatives who were furious when he criticized the Navy last
year for ousting 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn on charges relating to from
adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Several conservatives said comments in support of Lott by Armey,
who wants to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker, were intended to
help him win favor with conservative House members who believe he
has not been honest in acknowledging his role in the failed coup
attempt against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible is very clear on this,'' Armey said, adding that
``both myself and Sen. Lott believe very strongly in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published on Monday, Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, a longtime foe of homosexuals, stepped up his criticism.
``They start by pretending that it is just another form of love,''
he told Congressional Quarterly. ``It's sickening.'' Helms was
responding to a new documentary that criticizes his treatment of
homosexuals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked about comments such as Lott's, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
said, ``I don't believe in discrimination of any kind.'' He said
the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization, ``should be part of
our party.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions are reminiscent of the 1996 presidential contest,
when Bob Dole's campaign was thrown into turmoil when it returned a
contribution from the Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican Party, said the
denunciations of homosexuality could be politically beneficial
because ``when people are honest about their views most people
respect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said of the comments: ``I'm not concerned about what
any of those leaders have said. I agree with them. I don't know
that we fully understand very much about the sources of
homosexuality or if there is a way to alter that. I've talked to
some people in both the scientific and theological communities, and
they don't seem to be very clear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Republican leaders in Texas barred the Log
Cabin Republicans from setting up a booth at the party's state
convention. Robert Black, a party spokesman, inflamed the issue
when he likened the group to the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is weighing a bid for
President in 2000, won praise from Reed and other Republicans by
trying to tamp down the oratory from the state party. A statement
issued by his office said, ``Gov. Bush believes all individuals
deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. While he differs
with the Log Cabin Republicans on issues such as gay marriage, he
does not condone name calling.''
</P>
<P>
   That same weekend, at a gathering of Republican presidential
aspirants in Iowa, Bauer appeared with Reggie White, the Green Bay
Packers star who had called homosexuality ``one of the biggest sins
in the Bible.'' And another prospective contender, Steve Forbes,
appeared with the Rev. Louis Sheldon, a vociferous critic of
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he spoke briefly with Lott after he made his comments
_ and he expressed no regrets. ``I told him to hang in there,''
Bauer recalled. ``But he was feeling OK. Apparently he got a lot of
phone calls from people saying that they admired his courage.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continues among Republicans, this much is clear:
Lott no longer wants to talk about homosexuals. Asked about his
remarks, he replied, ``I think enough has probably already been
said about that.'' He then stuck out his tongue and sputtered into
a reporter's tape recorder.

SUMMER TRAVEL ROAD WARNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 5)  
(Eds: The words ASTERISK and NUMBER in parentheses have been used
twice each instead of the symbols, which are non-transmittable to
many newspaper systems.)

<P>
   Talk about traffic jams! This summer's hot spots on the national
traffic-jam roster include a couple at least a year old. Several
new repair projects are creating major delays, up to two hours. As
resurfacing and widening of the middle-aged Interstate system
continues, long-distance drivers who have been barreling along may
find themselves trapped in a maze of overheating cars.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also good news. Some states have created phone
systems and Web site reports with up-to-date traffic and transit
information. In addition, there are slick databases for Boston,
Philadelphia, Washington and Cincinnati. Details on this system,
called Smartraveler, are below.
</P>
<P>
   But first, here is a quick view of national traffic knots
assessed by the AAA, state highway departments and other safety
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tennessee.  &LR; The problem bringing the most driver reports, the
AAA says, is on I-24 south of Nashville. Between Exit 53, the link
to I-440, a perimeter road, and Exit 81 at Murfreesboro, the road
is being widened and the ramps are being improved, with blasting
involved, which requires the stopping of traffic. If debris will
cause traffic to be blocked for 15 minutes after a blast, the
Tennessee Department of Transportation says, a detour is posted.
The state says that two lanes in each direction must be kept open
from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday; blasting and lane
reductions take place on weekends, which may affect vacationers.
The AAA reports that delays of two hours are possible.
</P>
<P>
   On the bright side, the 60-mile detour around a blockage on I-40
near the Smokies at the  &UR; Tennessee-North Carolina &LR;  line is now but
a memory. Repairs of the road after last July's rock slide were
complete at Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee provides traffic information by phone and on a Web
site, both updated weekly, usually on Fridays. A call to (800)
858-6349 provides a menu of Interstate numbers so drivers can
listen to information on a specific route. The Web site,
www.state.tn.us/transport, gives the same information, with a map.
This site, among others, provides links to other state
transportation departments _ some valuable, others not really
intended for drivers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Connecticut. &LR;  Work on I-95 continues. The repair concentration
this year is in the western portion, from the New York
State-Connecticut line to New Haven. Picking up the Merritt Parkway
at the Cross Westchester avoids this work as far east as Milford.
Sue Reynolds of the State Department of Transportation says
construction is scheduled around the rush hours, with work going on
from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. and after 10 p.m. During construction hours,
there are lane restrictions for long stretches, Ms. Reynolds says,
so an extra hour of travel time should be allowed then. There is
also some construction on the link between I-91 and I-84 in
Hartford. It goes on between 9 a.m. and 3 p.m. and after 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Q Bridge work over the Quinnipiac at New Haven is complete,
and the Saltonstall Bridge in East Haven nearly done, Ms. Reynolds
said. ``There is as much work as last year,'' she added. ``It's
normal maintenance.'' Despite its position as a gateway to New
England vacation areas, Connecticut does not have a number to call
for information on construction delays.
</P>
<P>
   There are also problems on I-95 farther south.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; Pennsylvania, &LR;  repairs required after a tractor-trailer
accident on Memorial Day are almost complete in the Chester area.
Charles Metzger, a spokesman for the State Transportation
Department, said that the restriction to two lanes was expected to
end about July 15, when the concrete has cured. At first, the delay
was an hour, but detours have kept it to half an hour, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; Virginia, &LR;  I-95 is under construction on the 20 miles
between the North Carolina border and Exit 22. Traffic is down to
one lane each way, and the state says ``serious delays'' are to be
expected. The seven miles closest to the state line are nearly
done; the rest will take two years. Bridge repairs at Exits 58, 64,
67 and 69 are bringing lane restrictions in both directions.
Virginia has information on its Web site: www.vdot.state.va.us. But
it is not updated very often.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to  &UR; Yellowstone National Park &LR;  again face restrictions
as needed roadwork continues. Kerry Taylor at the visitor office at
Mammoth Hot Springs said that the Northeast Entrance and the East
Entrance were both being worked on, as well as Routes 14, 16 and
20, which link the East Entrance to Cody, Wyo. Driving in the park
is slow anyway _ allow an hour, for example, for the 16 miles on
the loop road between the Old Faithful Inn and Madison Junction.
But Ms. Taylor said 30-minute delays at the entrances should be
expected 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   The East Entrance will be open only between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
until Labor Day; the Northeast Entrance only from 5 a.m. to
midnight. The South Entrance road from Jackson, Wyo., and the West
Entrance from West Yellowstone, Mont., will be coated with a
sealant one lane at a time, she said, causing lane restrictions.
Information is available from the Visitor Office, (307) 344-2109.
The Park Service has a Web site with pictures and maps at
www.nps.gov, but road projects are not included.
</P>
<P>
   Mud slides this year have given  &UR; California &LR;  difficulties along
the coast. But Jim Drago, a spokesman for Caltrans, the state
transportation department, said that Route 1, the coastal road,
which had 70 washouts in 40 miles south of Carmel, was fully
reopened at the end of May from San Luis Obispo north to Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   The state has a wide-reaching Web site, brought up to date
daily, with links to highway numbers, maps and grids:
www.dot.ca.gov.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &UR; How to Get Travel Updates &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The new Smartraveler system marks a major step forward in
getting information to drivers. The Massachusetts Highway
Department and a company called Smartroute Systems created it in
1992; the Web site for eastern Massachusetts began to operate in
1996. Since then, Cincinnati, Philadelphia and Washington have
signed on; their Web sites went into operation in 1995 and 1997.
The information is gathered by people with cellular phones and
using radio reports, camera surveillance and helicopters. The
information is made available three ways: on the Web site,
www.smartraveler.com, which offers access to data collected in all
four areas, by touch-tone phone and by cell phone in the area. Here
are the numbers:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Boston:  &LR;  Call (617) 374-1234; on a cell phone in the area,
call (ASTERISK)1. Be prepared to punch in the route number you want
to use and the exit numbers you will travel between.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Philadelphia: &LR;  Call (215) 567-5678; on a cell phone, punch
(NUMBER)211.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Washington: &LR;  Phone (202) 863-1313; on a cell phone, punch
(NUMBER)211.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cincinnati:  &LR; Call (513) 333-3333; on a cell phone, punch 211.
</P>
<P>
   On the Web site, the user clicks on the medallion for the
highway number and gets a report on the situation. According to

WHITE HOUSE, STARR TAKE JABS OVER ATTORNEY-CLIENT CONFIDENTIALITY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With ``possible impeachment'' lacing their
arguments, the White House and independent counsel Kenneth Starr
sparred Monday over whether President Clinton's longtime friend and
confidant _ who also happens to be a government lawyer _ must
disclose his conversations with the president about the Monica
Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Linda Tripp's appearance before his federal grand
jury, Starr told a three-judge appeals panel that deputy White
House Counsel Bruce Lindsey's status as a government-paid lawyer
precludes using attorney-client confidentiality to avoid
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that Clinton's private attorneys could not be
forced to testify, Starr said government lawyers like Lindsey have
a duty to report evidence of wrongdoing that eclipses any
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Neil Eggleston, who represents the White House,
dismissed Starr's argument as exceeding ``the boundaries of
imagination'' and said it could deprive the president of effective
legal counsel in ``a run-up to possible impeachment,'' proceedings
by the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   Woven through the appeals court arguments were hints of a
broader examination of Lindsey's role as Clinton's most trusted
adviser. Lindsey, whose relationship with Clinton dates back to the
1960s when they were in Arkansas, has declined to tell the grand
jury about his talks with the president concerning the Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ordered Lindsey
to answer Starr's questions, saying the needs of his criminal
investigation outweigh the president's right to confidential
communications with his government-paid lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The White House appealed, which prompted Monday's two-part
hearing before appeals court judges Raymond Randolph, who was
appointed to the court by President Bush, and Judith Rogers and
David Tatel, who were appointed by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Under Starr's direction, grand juries in Washington and
Arlington, Va., are investigating whether Clinton or any of his
associates tried to cover-up alleged sexual encounters with
Lewinsky and with Democratic activist Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has indicated privately to congressional leaders that he
plans to submit his findings to the House of Representatives, the
body with the power to impeach a president.
</P>
<P>
   Eggleston said Starr wants information from meetings in which
Clinton, Lindsey and the president's private Whitewater lawyers
discussed a strategy for the president to follow in the Lewinsky
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Randolph, alluding to grand jury information available to
the court but not to White House lawyers, twice cautioned Eggleston
against assuming that Starr's investigation was focusing only on
Lindsey's role since the Lewinsky investigation became public in
January.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Randolph asked Starr if it was proper for White House
lawyers to provide advice to the president on the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case and the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Starr responded that his office was not taking a position on
whether Lindsey's role in advising the president on private legal
matters was a ``misuse'' of government funds.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr argued that government lawyers are not allowed to
withhold information from a federal grand jury, Judge Tatel asked
if the same would be true if the information was being sought ``not
by the grand jury, but by the House impeachment committee?''
</P>
<P>
   Starr paused, then acknowledged that conversations between a
deputy White House counsel and the president could remain
confidential if impeachment were in the offing. Starr quickly
added: ``It is premature for this court ... to be looking down the
road and to be worrying about impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Eggleston, himself a government official, maintained that
attorney-client confidentiality should be absolute and must extend
to Lindsey and others who have sworn a U.S. oath of office.
</P>
<P>
   Without attorney-client confidentiality, ``the president of the
United States is completely deprived of counsel,'' Eggleston said.
A president must know his government lawyers cannot be forced to
testify about their confidential conversations, or he will not
confide in them, Eggleston argued.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing comes on the eve of an appearance by Tripp, a
former White House employee who secretly tape recorded Lewinsky
allegedly discussing an affair she had with the president.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp also allegedly received so-called ``talking points'' from
Lewinsky suggesting ways Tripp could provide misleading answers
when questioned about the encounter between the president and
Willey, who has testified that Clinton fondled her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lewinsky have said under oath that they never had
sex. Clinton has said publicly he never asked anyone to lie and
that his behavior during the November 1993 meeting with Willey was
not improper.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, a former White House intern, has not testified before
the grand jury, and her lawyers are negotiating with Starr's staff
to protect her from prosecution in return for cooperating with the
investigation.

STRIKE OVER SALE OF PHONE COMPANY THREATENS TO SPREAD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Conn.)   (af)  
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ A coalition representing tens of
thousands of workers has called for a work stoppage to protest the
government's sale of a majority interest of the publicly owned
telephone company here, turning an uproar that has roiled the
island for weeks into one that threatens to paralyze it.
</P>
<P>
   The Greater Committee of Labor Organizations, which claims 58
unions with at least 150,000 government workers and thousands more
employees in the private sector, voted Sunday for a work stoppage
of unspecified duration to be announced just hours before it
starts.
</P>
<P>
   The action, expected this week, would broaden a strike by 6,400
telephone workers that began June 18 into one involving workers in
electrical, public transit, water and sewer and other industries.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the strike has been accompanied by intermittent
stoppages by other unionized workers, acts of sabotage that have
cut service to as many as 345,000 telephone users, and bombings by
a clandestine political group and others.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries, particularly in Latin America, have sold or
tried to sell their telephone monopolies over the last decade. The
deals were ways of raising money while improving telecommunications
services by letting others make the investment necessary to
modernize the utilities, telecommunications experts say.
</P>
<P>
   But the $1.87 billion sale of a controlling stake of Puerto Rico
Telephone Co. to a consortium of investors led by GTE Corp., of
Connecticut, has sparked a burst of nationalism seldom seen on
behalf of a phone company, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're defending the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. not only because
it's our rice and beans but because it's a national patrimony,''
said Annie Cruz, president of the Independent Brotherhood of
Telephone Workers, one of two telephone unions on strike.
</P>
<P>
   Telephone workers fear large numbers of layoffs and higher
telephone rates after privatization, and argue that the telephone
is a basic service that should remain in the public domain. But
they also criticize the government for negotiating the sale in
secrecy and agreeing to what they view as unfavorable terms in
order to get money to help fulfill election campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicions are heightened because the sale is part of an
aggressive privatization program under Gov. Pedro Rossello, whose
administration has already sold off the island's shipping company
and is selling publicly owned hospitals and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   And because the governor is pushing statehood for Puerto Rico, a
U.S. territory with 3.8 million residents, political opponents also
charge that privatizing is another way to make the island more
palatable to Congress, which is considering a bill to allow a vote
here on Puerto Rico's political status.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that there's a strategy to eliminate things
that differentiate us from the states,'' said Anibal Acevedo Vila,
a representative in the Puerto Rico House and president of the
Popular Democratic Party, which advocates Puerto Rico remain a
commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1990, it was Acevedo Vila's party that proposed selling
Puerto Rico Telephone to finance improvements in education and
public works. Acevedo Vila said the company was not sold because no
buyer would meet the price and rate and job guarantees required
then.
</P>
<P>
   But if the two main parties here have played politics with the
``Telefonica,'' as the company is known, public opposition has been
consistent. The most recent newspaper polls show that up to 65
percent of Puerto Ricans oppose the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the sale, the government of Puerto Rico will
receive $1.87 billion for a 50 percent-plus-one-share stake in the
telephone company. A consortium that includes GTE, Banco Popular of
Puerto Rico and other local investors will pay $375 million for
that majority stake. The other $1.5 billion will come from a
commercial loan taken by the privatized telephone company.
</P>
<P>
   The money from the sale would establish a $1 billion fund to
invest in infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone company was once in private hands, but thrived
only after the government bought it in 1974. Profitable and
technologically modern, the company pays about $80 million a year
in lieu of taxes to municipalities, education and the island's
public broadcasting station and is considered so productive its
unofficial symbol is ``Fortunata,'' a dewy-eyed cow.
</P>
<P>
   But Rossello says legislation passed by Congress in 1996
mandates that the company end its monopoly on intra-island calls.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello regards that as a cue to get out as he tries to reduce
the role of government in competitive areas in order to invest in
those where he said it can be the most productive, like education
and public safety.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications experts say privatization usually results in
expanded services and bigger reach, although layoffs occur and
rates sometimes go up. Opponents are directing much of their ire at
Banco Popular of Puerto Rico, which is identified through
advertising and civic sponsorships with Puerto Rican culture.
</P>
<P>
   The bank has been denounced by the unions as a ``traitor,'' and
its branches have been the target of boycotts, picketing and small
bombings, including one by the Boricua Popular Army, a clandestine
group known as Los Macheteros.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent to The Associated Press here, the group said:
``The sale of the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. is nothing more than a
declaration of war. Now they will know what war is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the protests, the Puerto Rican Legislature approved the
sale this month. The transaction is expected to be completed by the
end of the year, pending approval by the Federal Communications
Commission and other regulatory requirements.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, Spain's Telefonica Internacional last
week made a purchase offer which the company says surpasses GTE's
and which the government must consider while a sale is finalized.
</P>
<P>
   The unions want to stop any sale or, at the very least,
negotiate with the new owners over better terms for the workers.
Some are also calling for a referendum on the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello said there are no plans to change course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this is the right thing to do,'' he said.

END-OF-QUARTER BUYING SPREE PUSHES STOCKS UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Bond market report included here)  
 (JT)  
 By SHARON R. KING    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An end-of-quarter buying spree and lack of concern
about upcoming economic reports pushed major stock-market indexes
higher Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street was also bolstered as stronger markets overseas,
especially in Asia, eased some investors' concerns about the drag
those economies could have on U.S. corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and most other Asian stock markets were higher, buoyed by
news that a widely followed survey of Japanese business managers,
known as the tankan, showed the businessmen were more optimistic
than expected that business conditions in that country would
improve within the next three months.
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic economic front, however, Asia's current
recession left many investors confident that the Federal Reserve
Board is unlikely to lift short-term interest rates at the end of
its two-day policy-making session, which begins Tuesday. Investors
also showed little concern, traders said, that the June employment
report, due out Thursday, would rattle the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Although stocks finished higher Monday, investor selling
throughout the day pushed market indexes off the day's highs. The
selling was evidence, analysts said, that while the near-term
scenario appears rosy, a dose of skepticism remains about the
outlook for corporate profits in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   After gaining more than 100 points, the Dow Jones industrial
average closed at 8,997.36, up 52.82 points. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index rose 5.29 points, to 1,138.49, and the Nasdaq
composite index gained 21.55 points, to 1,891.08.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are still concerned about Asia, but it's not a
day-to-day thing,'' said Robert Basel, head of listed trading at
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Most investors' attention will be focused on second-quarter
earnings reports in the next few weeks, he said. Over all, the
feeling is that ``now you'll get the good news'' since most
companies that anticipated an earnings decline have already warned
of shortfalls, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' forecasts compiled by First Call Corp., a Boston-based
research firm, call for the earnings of companies that comprise the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index to grow by about 3.6 percent in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Since those earnings numbers have been reduced from about 12
percent at the beginning of the year, most companies should meet or
exceed those lowered forecasts, said George Jacobsen, chief
investment officer at Trevor, Stewart, Burton &AMP; Jacobsen Inc., a
New York investment management firm.
</P>
<P>
   But the worst from Asia is not over, Jacobsen cautioned, adding
that as governments take steps to alleviate the region's banking
crisis, a rise in imports could surface to pressure American
companies' earnings prospects in the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first quarter, corporate profits were viewed as being
an industry specific problem,'' Jacobsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second quarter, we're calling it a short-term problem.
But our take is there is a corporate profit problem and it is long
term.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Johnson, head equity trader at Blaylock &AMP; Partners in
Baltimore, said, ``It still will be very interesting to see how
third quarter profits will shape up. I'm one of those people that
has to be shown that my way of thinking is flawed and I just don't
believe this market is out of the woods.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Asia, Johnson said he is concerned that consumer
spending, which has helped buoy the market, will falter later in
the year.
</P>
<P>
   Most stocks that have gained in recent days are issues that had
been battered in previous weeks, such as Microsoft, Intel and
Disney, said Marshall Acuff, equity strategist at Salomon Smith
Barney. Companies Acuff calls consistent growers, or large
capitalization stocks that are leaders in their industries such as
Bristol-Myers Squibb, American International Group and Home Depot,
have also done well, illustrating investors' concern about future
economic and profit growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Treasuries Fall
</P>
<P>
   The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32 Monday, to 106
29/32, as the dollar declined, and investors held off buying before
the two-day Federal Reserve meeting. The bond's yield, which moves
in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.64 percent from
5.63 percent Friday.

AMERICANS SEE LIVE ACCESS TO CHINESE TV AS HIGHLIGHT OF SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-TRADE, CHINA-TV-COVERAGE,
CHINA-PEONY) 
(ps) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ It was not until minutes before the Saturday
news conference by President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin that
the Chinese leader decided to allow the event to be broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
   And Jiang did not inform the United States that he would permit
the broadcast of Clinton's Beijing University speech on Monday
until less than an hour before the address was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Monday that they were elated at both
decisions, which had been a central demand of the United States and
gave an American President unfiltered access to the Chinese people
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also said that progress at the summit on the
spread of weapons technology and the joint agreement not to aim
nuclear weapons at each other's cities were important, though
largely symbolic. It was the live television access to the Chinese
audience that made the summit meeting a breakthrough, according to
American officials.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials were still puzzling over just what
prompted Jiang to make the call.
</P>
<P>
   One theory they put forward to reporters as Clinton flew from
the Chinese capital to Shanghai was that Jiang used Clinton as a
sort of ventriloquist's dummy to raise the most sensitive topics in
Chinese society and then to defend his position to the Chinese
people and to reactionaries in his own government.
</P>
<P>
   Another school of thought was that Jiang knew how much the
American side valued access to the Chinese audience, and was not
willing to risk harming the relationship by denying that access.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that these decisions were made at the
highest level, by Jiang himself,'' said a senior American official.
``One can only speculate about his motivation. They recognized that
the price of engagement with us was giving us access to their
people. Jiang knew he needed to do that to make this a successful
summit.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained uncertain how deep or lasting an impact these events
would have on Chinese politics and society. Nor was it likely that
Clinton had silenced his critics at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real answer is going to come not from American officials,
but, of course, from the people of China,'' said Stanley Roth,
assistant secretary of state for East Asia. ``And we've seen
repeated quotes in the press from people indicating that it will
have profound reverberations from here. I think this will be
percolating within China for quite some time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's aides were unreservedly crowing Monday about the
``extraordinary,'' and ``historic'' summit meeting, and they
arranged a briefing for reporters by a senior official to talk ``on
background'' about all the 18 months of preparation Clinton and his
staff had made to pull off the event.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day meeting in Beijing was the fruit of a risky decision
in November 1996 to conduct reciprocal summit meetings in
Washington and Beijing without any conditions, and thus no
guarantee of success, the official said, giving this account of
what happened:
</P>
<P>
   The first of the two summit meetings, in Washington in October,
was judged a success by both sides. The meeting produced a handful
of substantive agreements, including China's pledge to stop sending
missiles to Iran and aiding Pakistan's nuclear program, and a
deepening of the personal relationship between Clinton and Jiang.
The two countries set up a bug-proof hotline between their
capitals, a link that was used for the first time in May after the
Indian nuclear tests. It was the first time that an American
President and a Chinese leader had spoken by telephone, according
to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere for the meeting in Beijing was more difficult,
the official said, with controversies swirling in the United States
over allegations of Chinese meddling in the 1996 Presidential
election and the suspected pilfering of sensitive American
technology through the launch of American satellites on Chinese
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials turned the difficult domestic
climate to their advantage, according to an account by a
high-ranking participant. The crescendo of criticism and a series
of congressional hearings on Chinese missiles and money put Clinton
in a quandary. He could cancel the summit meeting _ as 151 members
of Congress demanded _ or he could travel to Beijing without any
assurance that the meeting would bring results.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, went to
Beijing the first week of June with two messages for Jiang. He told
the Chinese leader that Clinton was ``unshakable'' in his
determination to make the summit meeting. But, he added, the
meeting had to produce a positive outcome or risk giving Clinton's
critics new ammunition and setting back United States-China
relations for months, or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was not a summit that moved the relationship forward,
it would feed the critics back home,'' a senior administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions boiled down to one central concern on the
American side, which they believed would nurture the relationship
while quieting domestic critics: Clinton must have access to the
Chinese people, through television, radio and public appearances
that were not unduly restricted by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leadership was noncommittal on the access question,
as well as the substantive matters still under discussion _ the
targeting of nuclear missiles, the spread of weapons technology and
human rights. Berger returned to Washington uneasy about the
meeting, then less than three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``As always with the Chinese, nothing much happens before the
end game,'' a senior White House aide said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Berger's deputy, James Steinberg, flew to Beijing on June 22,
four days before Clinton was to arrive in China, to try to nail
down progress on the nuclear targeting plan and China's membership
in an international non-proliferation agreement known as the
Missile Technology Control Regime.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of word-by-word negotiation of the statement on the
missile agreement, Steinberg and his Oxford-educated Chinese
counterpart agreed that the two nations would announce that China
would ``actively consider joining'' the missile accord. American
officials consider that a significant step that will ultimately
lead to China's acceptance of international rules governing sales
of medium- and long-range missiles capable of carrying nuclear,
biological and chemical warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The talks on the targeting of nuclear missiles went down to the
wire. On Friday, American officials expressed doubt that a deal
could be reached, because the Chinese insisted that the United
States renounce any first use of nuclear weapons, a policy change
the United States was unwilling to make. Agreement was finally
reached late Friday night, and was announced Saturday morning at
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   One large question remained: Would Jiang permit the live
broadcast? Although American officials did not indicate in advance
that Clinton intended to criticize the Chinese crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989, Jiang
appeared prepared for the rhetorical broadside. And he in fact
invited Clinton to respond to his comments on Tibet and other human
rights issues, rather than curtailing the news conference, as he
easily could have.

   UNITED NATIONS _ The East Timorese independence leader, Jose
Ramos-Horta, said on Monday that he would accept an offer of
limited autonomy within Indonesia now and a five-year delay on a
referendum on the territory's permanent status. But he would not
agree to a recognition of Indonesian sovereignty in the meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference here, Ramos-Horta recommended that
the question of who owns East Timor, which Portugal abandoned and
Indonesia seized in 1975, be frozen while changes in the territory
take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is progress on the ground that would be beneficial to the
people of East Timor and beneficial to the Indonesians,'' he said,
responding to proposals made on June 10 by President B.J. Habibie.
Ramos-Horta defined that progress as a reduction of Indonesian
troops in East Timor and the release of all political prisoners,
including Jose Xanana Gusmao, a guerrilla leader who has served
five years of a 20-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos-Horta had earlier seemed to rule out any compromise, even
in the short term, and he remains committed to East Timorese
independence. Habibie has already said that independence is not
possible, and has linked even limited autonomy to an international
recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor, which has
been denied.
</P>
<P>
   Under President Suharto, who resigned in May after more than 30
years in power, a special administrative status for East Timor's
800,000 people had not even been considered, and Ramos-Horta said
he welcomed Habibie's gestures.
</P>
<P>
   The new president also recently met Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo
of East Timor, with whom Ramos-Horta, who lives in exile in
Australia, shared the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos-Horta cited changes in both Indonesia and South Korea,
where longtime dissident and opposition leader Kim Dae-jung assumed
the presidency this year. He said the changes amounted to ``a
collapse of the Berlin Wall in East Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   In this atmosphere, Ramos-Horta said, there is room for
compromise if Indonesia does not insist on conditions.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the East Timorese had been asked not to indulge in
violence against Indonesians. There have been scattered incidents _
like a reported shooting of a Timorese man Monday after a crowd of
Timorese attacked a vehicle carrying security officials assigned to
protect European diplomatic visitors. But such episodes are
probably provoked by government agents, he said.
</P>
<P>
   There have not been any clashes between Timorese guerrillas and
Indonesian troops since April, he said, adding that Timorese have
told him the troops are not being paid regularly during the
country's financial crisis and may have begun to lose heart.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos-Horta said he had not been asked by Indonesian officials
to join in talks about the territory.

MONSANTO SET TO ACQUIRE CARGILL'S FOREIGN SEED UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Minn., Mo.)   (af)

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Monsanto Co. will buy Cargill Inc.'s international
seed operations for $1.4 billion, the two companies said Monday, in
one of the clearest signs yet of expectations that biotechnology
will play a pivotal role in agriculture's future.
</P>
<P>
   The deal furthered an alliance the two companies formed this
spring, when they set up a joint venture to meld Monsanto's
biotechnology prowess with Cargill's huge stake in grain
processing, feed production and other parts of the food chain. It
signaled that Cargill's confidence in Monsanto's future had not
been shaken Monsanto's pending sale of itself to American Home
Products Corp., a huge deal intended to exploit the links between
biotechnology research in all of what are known as the life
sciences from food to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's deal also reflected Cargill's weakening strategic
position with biotechnology beginning to overtake traditional plant
breeding as the key to developing valuable new crops.
</P>
<P>
   Cargill, a privately held conglomerate based in Minneapolis, has
profited from having overseas operations that are among the largest
in the fragmented global seed market. The strains of corn and other
plants Cargill has developed through traditional breeding are
popular in Latin America and among the world leaders in tropical
climates. But the company conceded that it has been too slow to
invest in biotechnology to remain a major player going forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't have the biotech capability and cost effective
access to biotech is now critical,'' said Fredric Corrigan,
president of Cargill's agricultural group.
</P>
<P>
   For Monsanto, the deal is intended to speed up the process of
penetrating overseas markets with such popular products as corn
engineered to create its own insecticide and soybeans that can
tolerate being sprayed with Monsanto's Roundup herbicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential for our existing biotechnology traits outside
North America is roughly double the acreage potential within North
America,'' said Hendrik Verfaillie, president of Monsanto, which is
based in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the latest in a string of seed company acquisitions
by Monsanto, culminating in its double-barreled announcement in May
of agreements to spend well over $4 billion in stock and cash for
DeKalb Genetics Corp., a leading corn seed company, and Delta and
Pine Land Co., the United States' largest cotton seed company.
</P>
<P>
   The technology and the hefty valuations on the seed companies
were expected to encourage still further consolidation. Monday's
deal left the fate of Cargill's domestic seed business hanging. And
rumors continued to swirl about potential mergers or alliances to
come.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty clearly heading down to three companies or groups
of companies in grains and oilseeds,'' said Bonnie Wittenburg, who
follows agriculture for George K. Baum &AMP; Co. One group would be
built around Monsanto, another around the alliance of Pioneer
Hi-Bred International and DuPont, and the third around Novartis,
the Swiss company that is Europe's largest entrant, Ms. Wittenburg
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Biotechnology critics fear the first generation biotech crops
will eventually backfire by encouraging the development of even
more devastating insects and weeds. But commercial farmers have
embraced them rapidly because they produce higher yields and, for
now at least, reduce reliance on harsher chemicals.

 &HT;    Day care centers, camps more alert for child illnesses
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When three toddlers who attended the same home day
care center became ill with E. coli, health officials thought the
center might be a common link.
</P>
<P>
   It was a likely suspect. Though investigators soon shifted their
focus to whether the bacteria might have spread when the youngsters
played at Marietta, Ga.'s White Water Park, the cluster of cases
underscores the potential for infections at day care centers and
summer camps.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you group children in diapers together, that is a high
risk group for the spread of infectious diseases and that's why we
have very specific regulations to address it,'' said Jo Cato,
director of the child care licensing section of the office of
regulatory services for Georgia's Department of Human Resources.
</P>
<P>
   Children playing with each other at day care centers or summer
camps can pass along the E. coli bacteria when children or staffers
do not properly wash their hands after using the bathroom or
changing a child's diapers. Though E. coli is among the most
serious infections that can spread through feces, an infected child
might expose others to hepatitis A, salmonella, pinworms and polio.
</P>
<P>
   State officials closely monitor day cares to prevent such
transmissions, Cato said. If there is a health concern or an
outbreak of an infectious disease, day care centers are required to
call in health officials.
</P>
<P>
   They also must follow the state's health and safety regulations,
including strict infection control practices. Day care staffers
must make sure to wash their hands with anti-bacterial soap before
handling children, food or toys. They also should help kids wash
their hands after using the bathroom; they also disinfect toys and
clean surfaces where diapers were changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of diligence to apply (preventive measures) is
greater in a day care just because more people are involved,'' said
Mel Ralston, public health adviser for the Georgia division of
public health. ``But the practices are just the same. The things
you would do to prevent diseases of the gut would be the same as
the preventions in any household.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, children at day care centers and summer camp programs
have a greater chance of catching and spreading such illnesses,
simply because they're in a group, health officials say.
</P>
<P>
   That fact led White Water to ban small children in day care or
summer camp groups from the amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   Parents and day care operators also are on alert. Elaine
Kamienny, owner and director of a Kids R Kids in Marietta, said
concerned parents have approached her about the possibility of
their children catching E. coli. The center is about 20 minutes
away from White Water, but she told parents that kids don't go
there on outings.
</P>
<P>
   Kamienny said that she and her staff make sure that the
environment the children are in _ whether it is at a neighborhood
swimming pool or within their own center _ remains safe and
sanitary. ``If a toy goes into a kid's mouth, we immediately
disinfect it,'' she said. ``We do normal things to keep children
healthy.''

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The White Water E. coli outbreak has widened,
public-health authorities confirmed Monday, taking in more cases,
more states - and more days on which children might have been
infected.
</P>
<P>
   Four additional confirmed cases were added to the tally Monday
by the Georgia Division of Public Health: a 7-year-old from Bartow
County, Ga. who is not sick enough to be hospitalized; one child in
Illinois; and two children in Alabama. In total, 17 children - 10
in Georgia and seven from five other states - have been sickened by
E. coli O157:H7 infection that is believed to have been spread at
the waterslide themepark in Marietta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the cases have been proved by genetic fingerprinting to
have been caused by one strain of bacteria, showing that they
belong to the same outbreak. Results of tests on the other 12,
being performed by DPH and the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, are pending.
</P>
<P>
   All four of the children added to the list Monday have been
proven by laboratory culture to have been infected with
life-threatening strain of E. coli O157:H7. Their genetic
fingerprinting will not be completed for a week, said DPH
spokeswoman Joyce Goldberg, all four of the new cases visited White
Water.
</P>
<P>
   In a troubling development, officials said four of the 17 - the
two Alabama children, a Georgia case discovered last week, and
Matthew Addison, a 3-year-old in critical condition with hemolytic
uremic syndrome in Louisville, Ky. - visited the water park not on
June 11 or 12, when the other children were presumably infected,
but six days later, on June 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have wracked our brains, and we can't come up with any
other possible exposure,'' Randy Addison, 38, said in a phone
interview from his son's hospital room. ``My wife has always been
paranoid about E. coli; she won't even allow our kids to have
fast-food hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   DPH epidemiologists theorize that the White Water kiddie pool
was contaminated three separate times, Goldberg said, adding that a
child infected on one of the first two days could have spread the
infection on the third day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes sense that a child in the early stages of infection
could have come back before showing symptoms,'' she said. ``It
could be the original child, but that child might have been so
symptomatic that a parent wouldn't have taken them back to the
park.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the widening of the outbreak from two days to six, state
officials said Monday that they believe the danger has passed.
Because the incubation period for E. coli - the time between
infection and the development of noticeable symptoms - is no longer
than nine days, any child who was infected would be sick by now,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your child was at White Water from June 11-17 and has not
shown symptoms, there is no cause for concern,'' said Dr. Kathleen
Toomey, Georgia's public health director.
</P>
<P>
   But to others viewing the outbreak, that assurance may have been
issued too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it highly unlikely that the same sick child is coming
back and contaminating the wading pool day after day,'' Randy
Addison said in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Glyn Caldwell, state epidemiologist for Kentucky, not long
ago investigated a similar swimming pool outbreak of viruses that
infected a swim team even though their pool's chlorine levels were
adequate. It turned out, he said, that the pool's chlorinating
equipment was broken; instead of metering pool chemicals through
the equipment, employees added them to the water once a day by
hand. Tests done in the morning read within legal limits; but by
evening, he found, the chemicals were almost gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you wind up with pieces that don't fit the pattern,'' he
said of the newly discovered June 17 infections, ``you have to ask
whether they're part of what you're looking at - or whether there
are other sources that you need to test.''

TURNOUT CONTINUES TO DROP IN PRIMARIES THIS YEAR
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Continuing a downward trend in voter turnout, fewer
than 17 percent of those old enough to vote have gone to the polls
in statewide primaries this year, according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate said the decline may be a prelude to the lowest
general-election turnout ever this November.
</P>
<P>
   Of 16 states with two statewide party primaries, only three
recorded increases from the last comparable primary, while 10
states recorded their lowest turnout ever, the report showed. This
despite recent efforts to make it easier for people to vote.
</P>
<P>
   While measures like the National Voter Registration Act,
commonly known as the motor-voter law, have increased
registrations, they have failed to increase turnout at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The study also showed that fewer voters turned out in states
that made an effort to increase participation with programs like
Election Day registrations and simplified absentee voting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem we have is not procedural but motivational,'' said
Curtis Gans, director of the committee. ``There is no quick fix for
what ails the American political system.''
</P>
<P>
   Gans said that the decline in primary voters was not an
aberration, but a trend that has driven down participation by 25
percent in the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are witnessing this year,'' Gans said, ``is a
continuation of the disaffection, disinterest and disengagement
from politics.''
</P>
<P>
   One notable exception in the trend, the study found, was in
California. With contentious propositions on the ballot and the
state's first ``blanket'' primary, in which voters were allowed to
choose candidates without regard to party, voters turned out in
greater numbers, suggesting that they can still be motivated by
important issues.
</P>
<P>
   The study shows a sharp decline in turnout after a peak of more
than 32 percent in 1970. In 1974, the figure dropped to 24 percent.
This year only 17 percent of the voting-age population turned out.
</P>
<P>
   Gans said he saw two problems: a lack of motivation and
education for young people about the political system, and the
unregulated use of advertising on television.
</P>
<P>
   Of 87,531,000 people of voting age, derived from the 1990
census, 14,757,247 have voted in primaries so far this year. The
voting-age population includes aliens, convicts and those ruled
mentally incompetent, overstating the actual number of eligible
voters. But Gans said it is the only figure that can be compared
from election to election.

TUCSON GROCERS FEAR WELFARE DEBIT CARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (TUCSON, Ariz.) - Tucson grocers worry the fireworks could get a
little too close this Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third-busiest weekend for food retailers and it's also
the week that the state of Arizona chose to replace food-stamp
coupons and welfare checks with plastic debit cards for 20,000
people in Pima County.
</P>
<P>
   Grocers fear the program could leave confused and embarrassed
food-stamp shoppers in front of checkout lines with no way to pay
for their groceries and people waiting behind them ready to
explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them it wasn't a good time, but they said it was too
late to change it,'' said Dwayne Richard, president of the Arizona
Food Marketing Alliance, who expects grocers to bear the brunt of
people's frustrations as the new card owners learn how to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Grocers and state officials say this switch from paper to
plastic is giving them the jitters.
</P>
<P>
   It's a big change for many food-stamp shoppers who are
unfamiliar with plastic's personal identification numbers and
activation dates. And the state's system isn't simple.
</P>
<P>
   Recipients access both cash benefits and food benefits on the
same debit card. Cash benefits are available through the new card
Wednesday (July 1).
</P>
<P>
   But the July date to access food-stamp money is different for
each recipient, depending on the first letter of the recipient's
last name.
</P>
<P>
   Grocers fear this detail will not be clear to many food-stamp
shoppers until after they've stacked their carts for holiday
picnics, stood in line and had their groceries tallied by cashiers.
</P>
<P>
   Cashiers are prohibited by law from asking a shopper how he or
she intends to pay for groceries until after the order is tallied,
Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   So cashiers who suspect there may be a problem can't keep it
from happening.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare recipients in 32 states are already using the card
system, which government officials say saves taxpayer money, is
less vulnerable to fraud, and is more convenient for users.
Food-stamp shoppers in Maricopa County, the greater metro Phoenix
area - make the change in February, and the entire state will be
converted to plastic by August 1999. All states are expected to be
using the system for food stamps by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the new system's technical glitches, educating card
users has been the most common problem in all states, said Carole
Throssell, spokeswoman for the national Food Marketing Institute,
the grocers' lobbying group in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Users frequently assume the debit card works like a credit card
and will permit them to exceed the amount the government credits to
their card each month, Throssell said.
</P>
<P>
   But Arizona Department of Economic Security officials have
assured grocers that Arizona's technical system is well-tested and
sound and that 95 percent of Pima County's food-stamp shoppers have
visited their DES office to receive personal training, including a
12-minute video, before picking up their card.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona initiated the thorough, personal training after some
states experienced problems when they simply mailed debit cards to
each welfare and food-stamp user, said Dayne Coffey, DES program
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Many people who got the card in the mail didn't realize they had
to call a number to activate the card or failed to understand the
importance of memorizing PINs and activation dates.
</P>
<P>
   Food-stamp shoppers in Pennyslvania, which began using debit
cards in November, received similar face-to-face training given in
Pima County. But Pennsylvania grocers report many of their
food-stamp shoppers are still lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our retailers have hired additional staff persons to stand by
and assist customers,'' said David McCorkle, Pennsylvania Food
Merchants Association president.
</P>
<P>
   And many new Pima County card owners who received their training
as early as May, immediately went out and tried to buy groceries
with their new but unactivated card, Richard said.
</P>
<P>
   The new system also could leave some hungry people behind.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 Pima County food-stamp recipients still haven't
responded to their letter instructing them to visit their DES
office to pick up their card, Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little concerned with the inner-city homeless. We
didn't get a good show up,'' Coffey said. Some homeless could be
mentally ill, alcoholics or drug users, or just haven't been able
to collect their mail, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to realize they're out of food stamps,'' Coffey
said, ``and go wandering into their (DES) offices sometime this
month.''

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: CLINTON'S TRIP AIDED BY TV COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-DAY, CHINA-TRADE, CHINA-PEONY) 
(th) 
 By CARYN JAMES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When a Beijing University student asked whether Americans had a
distorted view of China, President Clinton answered by pointing to
a gallery crammed with lights and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you can see, a few people come with me from the news
media,'' he said. ``I hoped that my trip would help show a full and
balanced picture of modern China.'' He almost got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   Though intensely focused on human rights, television has
depicted a country so complex and changeable that reporters can
hardly keep up. One minute they are wondering why dissidents were
arrested during Clinton's trip (deliberate insult or public
relations gaffe?). The next they are wondering why President Jiang
Zemin allowed his news conference with Clinton to be televised live
(sign of freedom or public relations coup?).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Clinton got a television gift that is a
politician's dream. In two dramatic appearances, he talked directly
to millions of people without those pesky reporters and producers
getting into the act. His news conference with Jiang and his
question-and-answer session after his speech at Beijing University
came as close to television verite as we are likely to see in
politics.
</P>
<P>
   For moments at a stretch (an eternity in television time) it was
just Bill Clinton and the camera. He talked spontaneously about
ideas, appeared relaxed yet in command, and sent home an image far
different from the tense, beleaguered one that has haunted him for
months. Because of such transforming moments, television helped
shape the meaning of this summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And while all the reporters rightly emphasized how rare the live
television broadcasts were in China, the trip has been just as
revealing about American television.
</P>
<P>
   Coverage in the last few days has offered a rare chance to
experience surprising, live, sometimes leisurely news as it
unfolds, and it has affirmed the primacy of the 24-hour news
channels over the networks.
</P>
<P>
   Those two things clearly go together. The 24-hour channels (CNN,
MSNBC and Fox News Channel) carried the post-summit news conference
and the Beijing University speech live.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the news conference began just before midnight
Friday in the Eastern United States (no expensive, prime-time
programs to disrupt), among the major networks only ABC carried it,
halfheartedly and because it happened to coincide with
``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   After 45 minutes, ABC bailed out (about 25 minutes before the
end, it turned out), with Ted Koppel thanking viewers for their
patience and sounding apologetic as he explained that the network
had expected simultaneous translation, which would have cut the
time in half.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference did start off in a stiff, logy way, with
Clinton and Jiang reading statements and then stopping for
translations. But as it unfolded, it was possible to watch this
supposedly predictable appearance transform itself into an
electrifying debate.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton diplomatically ticked off the historic events that
had taken place in Tiananmen Square, his statement built in tension
as he headed toward 1989, finally saying, ``Nine years ago, Chinese
citizens of all ages raised their voices for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point you could sense Clinton speaking past the
reporters in the room, directly to people at home, especially those
who had criticized him for going to China in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   As the two presidents civilly disagreed on volatile issues (the
Dalai Lama, Tiananmen Square in '89), the exchange acquired a
fascination and suspenseful rhythm that were not recaptured in the
snippets played back later. In a world of scripted performances,
there was high drama in watching two political leaders thinking on
their feet, well coached though they must have been.
</P>
<P>
   There were many such television moments, revealing because they
were unplanned and unfiltered. At Beijing University (on Sunday
night, Eastern time), the students presented Clinton with skeptical
questions. Was his commitment to working with the Chinese sincere,
or ``Do you have any other hidden face behind that smile?'' one
young man asked, generating applause from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I did, I would mask it behind a smile,'' Clinton said, then
assured the students that his position was genuine. All were
equally telling: the question, the applause, the glib human
reaction followed quickly by the political response.
</P>
<P>
   When the cameras strayed from the president, they captured some
startling, wordless images that added to the sense of a China in
which the old repression maintains its hold. Every network and
cable channel carried film of Chinese people being led away by the
security police.
</P>
<P>
   There were several incidents: two people protested by lying down
in front of a bus filled with American journalists; in other cases
people were led away when approached by American reporters on the
street.
</P>
<P>
   However wide and complex its potential reach, television tends
to speak with a single voice. Reporters declared this trip a
political success beyond the White House press office's wildest
dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's critics were given their moments on the Sunday news
shows. And Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and the national
security adviser, Sandy Berger, who seemed to be everywhere at
once, were presented with the tough issues that had been expected
to overshadow this trip: why Clinton did not meet with Chinese
dissidents; accusations about illegal Chinese campaign
contributions to the Democratic Party; the selling of satellite
technology to China. The questions, answers and even the Republican
disagreements had a perfunctory tone.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even China couldn't completely dispel interest in the
juicy prospect of Linda Tripp's testimony before the grand jury,
scheduled for Tuesday. Without China, imagine how the talking heads
would have been salivating. More depressing, imagine the lurid,
wall-to-wall Tripp coverage we have in store. &QL;

GROCERS DECRY WELFARE DEBIT CARD AS COSTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAT KOSSAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) - Arizona grocers say the state's new program that
converts welfare checks and food-stamp coupons into a plastic debit
card is costing them money, and they want to be reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should it cost us money to do the work of the state?''
asked Dwayne Richard, president of Arizona Food Marketing Alliance.
``The state is saving money and the retailers are picking up the
cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona grocers say the program costs them in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   - Most large chains must train their floor and office staff to
handle the new debit card system.
</P>
<P>
   - Most say the one or two free debit card terminals the state
system is willing to provide are worthless in a store with five,
eight or 12 check-out counters.
</P>
<P>
   To make sure their customers are not inconvenienced, large
stores must be ready for food-stamp shoppers in all lines. That
means the state is forcing them to readjust their existing software
at a cost of up to $750 a store or $30,000 per large chain, Richard
said.
</P>
<P>
   - Using the old food-stamp coupons is similar to a cash
transaction, with little cost involved. But the new state system
sharply increases debit card purchases, which costs retailers from
2 cents in the largest stores to 20 cents in the smaller ones each
time they swipe a card through their cash register computer,
Richard said. Some states have agreed to reimburse retailers,
including Maryland, Texas, New Jersey and Illinois. Arizona has
not.
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely these new costs will be coming out of the grocer's
profits, which average a razor-thin 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that kind of profit margin, any new costs will be passed
on to the customer,'' said Debra Albery, a spokeswoman for Safeway,
which has 10 stores in Pima County.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers in Arizona and across the country like the concept of
debit cards for welfare shoppers, but similar complaints are being
heard around the country, said Carole Throssell, spokeswoman for
the Food Marketing Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're fairly widespread,'' Throssell said. ``We've been
frustrated by efforts of state and federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has not demanded uniformity in operating
systems from state to state, forcing some merchants to accommodate
two different systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a patchwork quilt system that is cumbersome,'' Throssell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last session, legislators failed to make the changes in the
program the grocers wanted but agreed to fund a study on the
program's financial impact on Pima County retailers, who begin the
program July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The state official running the program said he would support
legislation to give retailers a tax break for documented start-up
costs they incur, but he's not prepared to ``subsidize'' retailers
and deplete $300,000 annual savings for the taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to enhance their revenue,'' Dayne Coffey, a
Department of Economic Security manager, said. ``If you don't want
to pay it, don't participate _ or use the state (computer)
system.''
</P>
<P>
   Grocers already absorb the cost of debit card use for other
customers, so they should do so for welfare customers also _ or
charge all customers a fee for using any debit cards, Coffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not suggesting they raise prices,'' he said, ``but if they
provide a service to one class of debit card holders they should
provide the same service to all customers who present a debit
card.'' &QL;

MICROSOFT RULING SHOWS A FAULT LINE OF ANTITRUST THEORY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Mich.)   (nk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ State and federal prosecutors insist that while
last week's federal Appeals Court ruling favoring Microsoft Corp.
might force them to alter their legal tactics, it also offers a
road map to help sharpen their new antitrust case against the
software giant.
</P>
<P>
   After several days of intense discussion, Justice Department
prosecutors and state attorneys general are even more determined to
press their case, several of them said in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has yet to decide whether to appeal last
week's ruling in an earlier federal suit against Microsoft. But
because the new case brought by the federal government and 20
states earlier this month deals with some of the same issues, state
prosecutors say they have decided that the Appeals Court opinion
has to be challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of discussion, and the consensus is this
was the dicta of just two judges,'' Wisconsin Attorney General
James Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new case, Michigan Attorney General Frank Kelly
declared, ``We would be remiss if we stopped short of taking this
case up to the highest decision-making body we can get to'' _ in
this case the full Appeals Court or, if necessary, the Supreme
Court. Federal officials say they share that view.
</P>
<P>
   Last Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the Appeals Court
overturned a District Court injunction that had prohibited
Microsoft from requiring computer manufacturers to install
Microsoft's browser software for navigating the World Wide Web as a
condition of installing Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 and its successor, Windows 98, which went on sale
last Thursday, are the operating system used on more than 90
percent of all computers sold today.
</P>
<P>
   In a 2-1 opinion, the panel said Microsoft had the right to add
whatever new features it wanted to its operating system, even if
that included ``bundling'' other products, as long as the result
benefited customers. The opinion contained the clear message that
this standard could also be applied to at least some of the issues
in the new case. Acknowledging that, a senior prosecutor directly
involved with the case said that last week's decision ``gave us a
framework to follow _ and a framework to attack'' in the new case.
</P>
<P>
   The state and federal antitrust suits have been consolidated,
and Steven Houck, chief of the Antitrust Bureau in the New York
attorney general's office _ and the lead litigator for the states
in the new suit _ agreed that the Appeals Court ruling would help
prosecutors define their new case.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said that the ruling would ``change the
emphasis of how we present our evidence'' in at least two ways.
</P>
<P>
   First, Houck said: ``We think the most important part of our
case is now the exclusionary contracts Microsoft has with Internet
service providers that require them to refuse to promote competing
browsers. What the Court of Appeals said had no impact on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under arrangements with several companies that serve as Internet
gateways _ including AT&AMP;T Worldnet and America Online _ Microsoft
places links to these companies' Web sites on the first screen
users see on their new computers. As part of those arrangements,
Microsoft has required the companies to promote only Microsoft's
browser, Internet Explorer, to the exclusion of competing products,
most notably Netscape Communications Corp.'s Navigator browser.
</P>
<P>
   In March, just before Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, was
scheduled to testify before a Senate committee about this and other
practices, the company announced that it was dropping these
restrictive contract provisions. But Houck remains skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft says they have eased those restrictions,'' he said.
``But I haven't seen the contracts. I've asked for them and haven't
gotten them. In any case, there is a body of case law that says if
you alter your behavior in the face of a lawsuit, it does not moot
the suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Doyle agreed, saying, ``We are particularly concerned with these
restrictive contracts with online services.''
</P>
<P>
   Houck and other attorneys general also said that they would
alter their method of litigating another part of the case that most
resembles the ``bundling'' charge in the earlier federal suit. In
the first suit, the Justice Department accused Microsoft of
violating a provision of antitrust law that regulates ``tying'' _
the bundling of one product with another as a condition of
licensing the more popular product _ in this case tying Internet
Explorer to Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   The Appeals Court ruling was framed around the tying provision.
But Houck said the plaintiffs would press the new case using a part
of the law that regulates monopolies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the law, monopolists are less free to engage in certain
behaviors, including this sort of behavior,'' Houck said. ``If the
Appeals Court decision holds, then the courts have abdicated any
responsibility for regulating the software industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal said the
attorneys general and federal lawyers had accumulated far more
evidence against Microsoft for their new case than the Justice
Department had gathered in its earlier case.

 By LAURENCE ZUCKERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Commerce Secretary William Daley and Zeng Peiyan, chairman of
the China State Planning Commission, gathered on Monday with
American and Chinese executives in the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing to announce $1.6-billion worth of new trade and investment
deals between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   While both sides tried to put the best face on a ceremony that
has become a staple of Chinese summit meetings with almost any
Western power, it was hard for the Americans to mask their
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   American companies like Boeing came away with far less than they
had expected even a few months ago. Many of the deals announced on
Monday were given inflated values or were the same ones announced
last fall, when President Jiang Zemin of China visited Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Executives who hoped that the summit meeting might help pry open
China's vast market to American insurance companies and banks came
away empty-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The poor showing is a result of the faltering Asian economy and
White House sensitivity to contentions that it helped American
aerospace companies conduct business in China in exchange for
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The visit occurs when the U.S. trade deficit with China is
running at the rate of $1 billion a week. The deficit has soared 20
percent this year compared to 1997 and is heading toward a record
$60 billion, according to administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   In past trips abroad, President Clinton has been a major booster
of American business, inviting executives to travel with him and
paying visits to American factories abroad. But Clinton's trip to
China has been noticeable for his conspicuous lack of attention to
American commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
   No executives accompanied Clinton to China, and he dropped plans
to visit a General Motors plant in Beijing and a Lucent
Technologies factory in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official who insisted on anonymity said the
White House felt vulnerable to accusations that business interests
were driving its ``engagement'' policy with China.
</P>
<P>
   At the signing ceremony, Daley hailed the agreements as a boon
to relations and said they would reduce the trade deficit and
``significantly encourage China's efforts at social and economic
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   He placed the total value of the 11 deals, which included
companies like Cargill, IBM, and Lucent, at $3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That includes an estimated $1.7 billion for a contract to
explore for methane signed by the Atlantic Richfield Co. that
appears to be highly speculative. The company said it would spend
$60 million to drill three test wells over the next three years. If
the wells prove viable _ a risky assumption in the energy business
_ then the life of the contract might be worth $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The General Electric Co. concluded a contract worth $160 million
to supply two 660-megawatt steam turbines to a power plant in
Shandong Province. A memorandum of understanding to supply those
turbines was signed on Jiang's trip to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing Co. received an order for 10 737 jetliners, worth an
estimated $400 million. Two months ago, Boeing executives were
hopeful that China would buy 50 jets, the same number that Beijing
ordered when Jiang was in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Boeing has been a good barometer of the state
of relations between Washington and Beijing. Much of the company's
expected airplane sales over the next 20 years depend on China.
When tension was high between the two countries in 1995 and 1996,
China placed two orders of 30 planes each with Airbus Industrie,
the European consortium that is Boeing's archrival.
</P>
<P>
   Now relations between Beijing and Washington are the warmest
that they have been in years, but air travel in China has plunged
this year because of the weakened Asian economies. Collectively,
Chinese airlines have totaled more than $200 million in losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have liked them to order a lot of airplanes but we
also understand the situation they are in right now,'' a spokesman
for Boeing in Beijing, Marta Newhart, said. ``A lot of the airlines
in China are not doing so well.''

REMAINS OF `UNKNOWN SOLDIER' FROM VIETNAM WAR ARE IDENTIFIED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The remains of an unidentified American serviceman
from the Vietnam War, buried beneath the Tomb of the Unknowns in
Arlington National Cemetery 14 years ago, are no longer unknown.
</P>
<P>
   They belong to First Lt. Michael Blassie of the Air Force, a
pilot whose attack jet crashed on May 11, 1972, near a village in
South Vietnam called An Loc. He was 24 at the time and ever since
has, officially, been considered missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   A new type of genetic test _ not available when President Reagan
honored the ``Unknown Soldier'' from the Vietnam War at a solemn,
symbolic state funeral on Memorial Day in 1984 _ has matched DNA
taken from the remains with DNA from Blassie's mother, Pentagon
officials said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon removed the remains from the Tomb of the Unknowns
last month after a lengthy investigation ordered by Defense
Secretary William Cohen concluded that the remains very likely
belonged to one of nine Americans killed in Vietnam, including
Blassie. The lieutenant's family had urged the Pentagon to conduct
the DNA tests after news reports raised questions about the
identity of the Unknown Soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who presided over the disinterment at what is one of the
nation's most revered memorials, just over the Potomac River from
Washington, is scheduled to announce the results at the Pentagon on
Tuesday, but the families of the nine missing Americans were
notified by telephone on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blassies have said they wanted to take the lieutenant's
remains home to the suburbs of St. Louis, where he was raised. They
have said they want to bury him at Jefferson Barracks National
Cemetery, near the grave of his father, George, a veteran of World
War II who died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The identification of the remains, which until last month lay
with unknown soldiers from the two World Wars and the Korean War,
has now raised the possibility that there will not be another set
of remains put in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials have already begun to ask whether there
should even be a new search for an unknown soldier. Although 2,087
Americans remain missing from Vietnam and unidentified remains have
been gathered, the advances in genetic testing have made it highly
unlikely that any set of remains can be called ``unknown'' with
absolute certainty.
</P>
<P>
   If a new set of remains were placed in the tomb, one official
said, ``you'd have to relive this chapter over and over.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN P. LOPEZ  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MONTPELLIER, France _ Steve Sampson, who came to France with much
fanfare, high hopes and what he called the best United States
soccer team ever, quietly resigned as U.S. coach Monday morning at
a breakfast meeting with U.S. Soccer federation president Alan
Rothenberg.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I made mind up my mind last night,'' Sampson said, when
contacted Monday night at a friend's home in Paris. ``Three losses
is not an acceptable result. Maybe it's time for someone else to
see what they can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson previously said he would not resign after the team's
dismal World Cup showing, but apparently the reality of a
last-place finish and lingering bad feelings from players who
harshly criticized his coaching were too much to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though I feel like we're playing a better brand of
soccer, I'm deeply hurt by the results,'' Sampson said. ``I think
we were dramatically unlucky. We probably wouldn't be having this
discussion if we were more precise in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was a victim of my own success and the team was a
victim of its own success. We raised the expectations of a lot of
Americans by some of the results we had (before the World Cup).''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sampson nurtured U.S. Soccer through the crucial years
after the United States played host to the 1994 World Cup. Under
Sampson, the U.S. qualified for the World Cup for the third
consecutive time and posted several significant victories before
France '98, including wins over Argentina, Brazil and Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I'm very pleased with Steve,'' Rothenberg said. ``The
extent of the criticism (against Sampson) was very unfortunate and
very unfair. It's unfortunate that in sports when you lose, you
lose your job. The hazard of the coaching profession is that you
usually lose your job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who said he would be willing to coach another nation or
take an administrative position with U.S. Soccer, forever will be
remembered for the hugely disappointing 0-3 World Cup experience.
</P>
<P>
   Among the three losses, the U.S. team fell to underdog and
political rival Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, to play well and dominate is not enough,''
Sampson said, referring to the Iran game. ``You have to play well,
dominate and win.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team also scored just one goal at France '98, the
lowest total of any nation in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous U.S. players who said they quietly questioned Sampson's
style before the World Cup began speaking up loudly in the days
after being eliminated. Tab Ramos described the experience as ``a
mess,'' and Alexi Lalas said Sampson had no master plan.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more questionable decisions Sampson made for the World
Cup were leaving veteran midfielder John Harkes off the team and
benching all-time leading American scorer Eric Wynalda for the
final two games. Sampson also ditched his much-hyped 3-6-1 game
plan after only one game in France.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson was hired as coach in August 1995 and led the U.S. team
to a 26-22-14 record overall.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the players speaking so harshly against him, Sampson
said, ``I just wish that people would look at themselves at the
same time they're looking at the coach. I'm prepared to take my
fair share of the blame. I'm not sure if some of the players are. I
can sleep easy. I'm not happy with the results, but I can sleep
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said he would not make a hasty decision in trying to
find a replacement for Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   Two names already mentioned among the candidates are Carlos
Quieroz, a highly respected Brazilian coach, and Carlos Alberto
Parreira, who led Brazil to the 1994 World Cup championship in the
United States.

   All in a fortnight's &QL; 
work for Sampras
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ More rain. More waiting. Far more anticipation
than action until midafternoon.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, there would be more Pete Sampras, too. For all
his recent troubles elsewhere, Sampras' victories at Wimbledon
remain as inevitable as the drizzle. Which is to say, pretty darn.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's being dissed in some circles, particularly the one
in the shape of Richard Krajicek's large mouth, there seems to be
nothing wrong with Pistol Pete's tennis. Maybe we should call him
Postal Pete because, rain or shine, he keeps making his appointed
rounds on Church Road.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras needed four days to dispose of Thomas Enqvist in three
sets, but dispose of him he finally did Monday, winning two
tiebreakers sandwiched around another weather interruption, the
fourth of their match. He and the Swede were on the court far less
than the 2{ hours they had to sit around twiddling their thumbs in
the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   But such is life here in Waterworld.
</P>
<P>
   ``You expect it,'' Sampras said. ``That's Wimbledon. It's part
of the aura of the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years, one blemish
</P>
<P>
   As is he. Except for Krajicek two years ago, nobody has beaten
Sampras on these sodden lawns going on six fortnights. He is 35-1
with four titles, as sparkling a record as anybody has compiled
over a similar span during the Open Era save for Bjorn Borg's 41-0
from 1976 through his loss to John McEnroe in the 1981 final.
</P>
<P>
   It was Borg, the inscrutable Swede, who begat a passion for the
sport in his country that would produce another dozen world-class
players in his stead, Enqvist among the latest. It was also Borg
who defined cool under fire. And rain.
</P>
<P>
   Once the showers came, as they always did _ and still do _ he
pulled out a deck of cards. When it was time to return to battle,
he gathered up his rackets and his lunch pail and, without changing
expression or his groundstrokes, churned out five successive
championships.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras prefers to ``just shoot the you-know-what'' during the
incessant hiatuses. But informed of Borg's means of staving off
boredom when the weepy patches blew in from the West Country, he
smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Must have worked,'' Pete noted.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras admits he doesn't suffer the stoppages gladly. He
believes the overnight suspension of his quarterfinal against
Krajicek in '96 proved fatal _ never mind that he had gone home
trailing two sets to love. He's a huge believer in rhythm, and the
Wimbledon experience isn't theoretically conducive to maintaining
any. ``It's the same for everybody,'' he said, ``but it's not easy.
It changes the look of a match.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was supposed to play Enqvist on Friday. They finally got
onto the court late Saturday, and although Pete started with six
aces in a row en route to a 6-3 first-set victory, at 1-0 in the
second they were chased off the court. Thereafter, he found himself
hanging on with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   He came out with guns blazing Monday, yet the afternoon's second
restart saw his serve suddenly falter. After smacking three of his
29 aces in the 10th game for 5-all in the third set, he was plagued
by faults in the 12th game, leaving him obliged to stave off three
set points.
</P>
<P>
   The Sampras second serve is the finest ever, however, so survive
he did, ultimately blowing Enqvist away in the tiebreak.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek takes off kid gloves
</P>
<P>
   Thus Pete advances to the round of 16 today against French
qualifier Sebastien Grosjean. But just once in Sampras' last seven
tournaments, starting with Indian Wells in early March, has he
advanced beyond this point, creating speculation that his lengthy,
rarely interrupted run as the world's solid No. 1 was kaput.
</P>
<P>
   Krajicek, for one, opines that Sampras has become a pigeon on
more surfaces than just clay. Having defeated Pete in their last
two meetings, plus that '96 showdown in the quarters here, the
Dutchman recently pronounced Sampras no better than the 10th-best
player on the ATP Tour today.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting words?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, that stuff doesn't faze me,'' Sampras said. ``I know my
capabilities. I know how I'm playing this week. My year has been a
bit up-and-down. I've had some bad days; that's all. I feel pretty
good, and I'm serving well here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has a ways to go before he'll get the chance to make
Krajicek dine on his verbiage. After Grosjean, he figures to run
into Mark Philippoussis _ no picnic on grass _ then encounter No. 3
seed Petr Korda, the Australian Open champion. Krajicek, in turn,
should have to beat twice-Wimbledon runner-up Goran Ivanisevic, who
hammered 44 aces in his two-part mini-series against Todd Martin.
</P>
<P>
   You strongly suspect, though, that Sampras badly wants a piece
of Big Richard. There's a score to be settled. If not for Krajicek,
Pete might be trying to make history this fortnight, instead of
spending most of it merely marking time.

SERB ON TRIAL FOR ALLEGED 1991 MASSACRE IN CROATIA COMMITS
SUICIDE  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE, Netherlands _ A Serb being tried for his role in a
massacre of more than 200 people in Croatia in 1991 has committed
suicide, the U.N. War Crimes Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia
said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the Serb, Slavko Dokmanovic, 48, the former mayor of
Vukovar, was found early on Monday morning hanging behind the door
of his cell. A spokesman for the tribunal said that Dokmanovic had
hanged himself from a door hinge.
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner was reportedly on medication for depression and,
according to tribunal officials, had tried to kill himself before
during the year he had been held in the detention center, in
Scheveningen, near The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The suicide abruptly closes the case against Dokmanovic just as
it was approaching its end. The trial, which began on Jan. 19,
ended last Thursday; the verdict was due on July 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no verdict now and the case is herewith
terminated,'' said Christian Chartier, the tribunal's spokesman.
``It must be very frustrating for the family, for the relatives of
the victims, for the prosecution and the defense, and maybe for
historians.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Chartier, Dokmanovic's lawyer had asked to increase
his client's medication on Friday. The prisoner again complained
that he was not feeling well on Sunday afternoon, and the prison
doctor who saw him ordered that he be closely monitored.
</P>
<P>
   Guards checked on him every 30 minutes and kept his cell lights
on. He was last seen alive at about 11:30 p.m. on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, Chartier continued, Dokmanovic apparently
managed to short-circuit his cell lights and then killed himself in
the dark. On the next guards' round, just after midnight, he was
found hanging behind his cell door.
</P>
<P>
   Dokmanovic, a quiet graying man with a droopy mustache, had been
charged with war crimes for his role in one of the first
well-documented atrocities by Serbs during the Balkan war. He had
served until mid-1991 and from November 1991 to 1996 as mayor of
Vukovar, a town of 85,000 people on the Serbia-Croatia border and
the site of savage fighting after Belgrade ordered the Yugoslav
army to attack it.
</P>
<P>
   According to the indictment against Dokmanovic, in the final
days of the siege several hundred people sought refuge at Vukovar
Hospital because they had been led to believe that an orderly
evacuation with international observers had been worked out between
the warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav army, which is dominated by Serbs, took control of
the hospital on Nov. 19, 1991. The next morning, Yugoslav and Serb
paramilitary soldiers pulled most men from the hospital, among them
``wounded patients, hospital staff, soldiers who had defended the
town, Croatian political activists, and other civilians,'' the
indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 300 men were taken to a farm just outside Vukovar and
there they were ``forced to run between two lines of soldiers'' who
beat them and later took them in small groups to a ravine where
they were shot and buried. More than 50 people are still missing.
The bodies of 198 men and 2 women have been found and identified.
At least two men died from the beatings.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dokmanovic was not charged with shooting anyone, his
indictment said that he helped organize the massacre. It says: ``At
all times, he aided and abetted or otherwise participated in these
events.''
</P>
<P>
   Three officers of the Yugoslav army have been indicted in the
same case but Belgrade has refused to hand them over.
</P>
<P>
   Dokmanovic was caught through a trick. He was invited to meet
U.N. officials at the Serbia-Croatia border in June 1997. He showed
up, not knowing that he had been indicted, and was immediately
arrested and flown to The Hague. That arrest was the first signal
that the tribunal had changed its strategy and was keeping
indictments secret.
</P>
<P>
   Dokmanovic had denied all the charges against him and his lawyer
has argued that he was the victim of mistaken identity. The lawyer
said his client had been very distraught and confused and was
arranging for a psychiatrist from Belgrade, who had come to see him
before, to travel once again to the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Two separate investigations _ one by the tribunal and one by the
Dutch police _ have begun to determine how the suicide could have
happened in the closely watched detention center. The U.N. cell
block is a part of the Scheveningen Penitentiary Complex.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal is now holding 27 people indicted for war crimes.
One prisoner, a Serb general, Djordje Djukic, was released without
trial for health reasons in March 1996 and died of cancer two
months later in Belgrade. Only two have been sentenced by the
tribunal since it opened in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Dokmanovic's trial, which began in January 1998, was one of the
fastest on record. During 35 days of hearings, 85 witnesses were
heard, in almost equal numbers for the prosecution and the defense.
Some legal experts argued that convincing and detailed evidence
against Dokmanovic was scant, while others believed he might face a
life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal's investigations of the Vukovar killings can now
continue only if and when prosecutors can arrest one or more of the
three other men indicted in the case. While the Vukovar massacre is
well documented, Chartier, the spokesman, said, ``the tribunal can
try people only on the basis of their alleged individual
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The three others indicted in the Vukovar massacre are the
commander of the Yugoslav army unit, Col. Mile Mrksic; his
subordinate, Maj. Veselin Sljivancanin; and the commander of a
special infantry unit, Capt. Miroslav Radic.

CASE HIGHLIGHTS DEBATE OVER PROPRIETY OF HOW REPORTERS OBTAIN
INFORMATION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reporters are constantly in search of information that public
officials or powerful businessmen want to keep secret. If they
manage to obtain the information, and it is explosive enough, they
may find themselves showered with awards and accolades.
</P>
<P>
   Depending, that is, on exactly how they obtain it.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction is at the core of the highly unusual apology to
Chiquita Brands International printed on the front page of the
Cincinnati Enquirer Sunday and Monday. In it, the newspaper's
publisher, Harry Whipple, and its editor, Lawrence Beaupre, said
they have facts that ``indicate that an Enquirer employee was
involved in the theft'' of Chiquita voice mail ``in violation of
the law.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue, for attorneys specializing in media law, is not that
internal information was illegally obtained. It was that the
reporter may have broken the law himself while getting the
information he sought.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ever had the situation where the reporter is actually
stealing material, you would tell the reporter not to do it and
presumably wouldn't publish the information,'' said James Goodale,
a lawyer with the Manhattan firm of Debevoise &AMP; Plimpton and a
former general counsel of The New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other situation, the one that is more common, is where
you're getting information from documents that obviously have been
taken from a company, or you get the documents themselves. You know
that the documents are coming from a person who shouldn't have
access to them. In that case it is my view that you publish the
information and you don't give it much of a thought.''
</P>
<P>
   The question of how confidential material is obtained has been
raised numerous times over the years, perhaps most famously in the
1971 Pentagon Papers case, in which a secret Defense Department
study of the Vietnam War was described and excerpted first in the
pages of The New York Times, then in The Washington Post and The
Boston Globe. The information had been obtained illegally by Daniel
Ellsberg, a consultant to the Defense Department
</P>
<P>
   As Burt Neuborne, a law professor at New York University,
explained, ``There's a distinction between a newspaper accepting
information from a third person who's gotten it improperly and the
newspaper itself engaging in the illegal activity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a case that raises some of the same issues, a jury found that
Capital Cities, ABC and two ABC News employees were guilty of fraud
in preparing a hidden-camera report to show unsanitary practices in
the handling of meat at the Food Lion supermarket chain. the two
employees lied in order to get jobs at a Food Lion store. The case
is on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer's carefully-worded apology, hammered out in
negotiations that culminated with the signing of a legal settlement
in the case late Saturday night, disavowed any conclusions about
Chiquita's ethics or business practices arrived at ``based upon the
contents of voice mail messages of employees of Chiquita.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement goes on to say that newspaper's ``representations,
accusations and conclusions'' about Chiquita Brands International _
based on these internal voice mails are ``untrue and created a
false and misleading impression of Chiquita's business practices.''
</P>
<P>
   The apology, hemmed in by legalities on all sides, did little to
clarify exactly how the lead reporter on the series, Mike
Gallagher, may have obtained what the series said were in excess of
2,000 voice-mail messages, some of them described in the series to
be verbal memos of executive's actions.
</P>
<P>
   A meeting in the paper's newsroom Monday was similarly
inconclusive, according to some of those present. Questions about
whether the Enquirer was backing off all the conclusions in the
lengthy report, which dealt with issues ranging from corporate
bribery of foreign officials to use of dangerous pesticides in some
of the company's foreign agricultural sites, were met with the same
response: ``Read the apology.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one staffer, who said the atmosphere at the paper was
``like a morgue'' came away with the impression that the editors
were trying to avoid disavowing the entire series, which was based
on extensive reporting beyond the disputed voice-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Among other legal constraints are the settlement agreement
signed by executives of Chiquita and the Enquirer on Saturday
night, and an ongoing investigation into the theft of the company's
voice mail messages by a special prosecutor in Hamilton County,
Ohio, the county in which Cincinnati is located.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Enquirer's May 3 stories, for instance, quotes a
message from Keith Lindner, Chiquita's vice chairman, to the
company's president and chief operating officer, Steven Warshaw and
several other top executives, recommending that the company try to
have a Panamanian government official's tour of the European Union
cancelled because it might be disadvantageous to the company's
interests.
</P>
<P>
   According to one high-ranking executive of Chiquita, who
insisted on anonymity, the company's voice-mail system, created by
Lucent Technologies Inc., records the keystrokes of anyone using a
voice mailbox _ all the keystrokes, that is, except the ones
designating the password that provides access to the mailbox. All
company employees _ including about 600 in the Cincinnati area and
40,000 more in as many as 60 countries _ are required to set
passwords protecting their voice-mail communications.
</P>
<P>
   This executive said that the company had recorded an intruder
going from one executive's voice mailbox to another.
</P>
<P>
   Gallagher, who has been fired by the Enquirer, could not be
reached for comment on his news-gathering techniques. His attorney,
Peter Hanley of Covington, Ky., refused all comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
   But Chiquita's president, Warshaw, said that he felt the rifling
of the voice mailboxes, whether by a reporter or at a reporter's
behest, was ``old-fashioned burglary. it doesn't matter if you pick
someone's lock or if someone like a repair person, to whom you've
given a key, comes to your house. It's still an old-fashioned kind
of crime. It's burglary.''
</P>
<P>
   Warshaw added that, ``You can imagine that first and foremost
for us is that a recognized publication has stated categorically
that the result of the reporting was inaccurate and untrue. That is
the most important thing for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly, in the apology they talk about the investigative
technique, if you will. As a company that operates throughout the
world selling food products, you can well imagine that the most
important thing for us is that we operated off a high moral and
ethical plane.''
</P>
<P>
   But the apology and the circumstances surrounding it,
particularly in light of the recent aggressive legal stance that
many corporations _ from Food Lion to the tobacco industry _ have
taken toward news organizations' activities, left Neuborne
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope that the newspapers will be aggressive and vigorous
in protecting the public's right to know,'' he said. ``If they draw
a line for themselves that is too protective of the notions of
property and too frightened of the notions of theft, they make it
almost certain that very serious wrongdoing will not be
uncovered.''

 WASHINGTON: and over.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Blassie's family has suggested that the Pentagon deliberately
obscured the remains' identity in a rush to declare an unknown
soldier from the Vietnam War. When he presided over the burial of
the remains, President Reagan used the occasion to expressed the
hope that a nation sharply divided over the war could unite in
remembrance of those who died in it.
</P>
<P>
   Blassie, a graduate of the Air Force Academy, died 26 years ago
when his A-37B attack jet crashed in flames outside of An Loc, a
hotly contested village near the border with Cambodia. Because of
the intense fighting, however, the site of the crash could not be
search and his remains recovered.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until five months later that a South Vietnamese
patrol reached the spot and recovered four ribs, the right humerus
and part of the pelvis, as well as a collection of personal items,
including Blassie's identification card and remnants of a flight
suit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon's investigation, the remains were
tentatively identified as Blassie's based on that evidence. In
1978, however, the Pentagon's Central Identification Laboratory in
Hawaii found that neither the blood type of the remains nor the
size of the humerus matched Blassie's. By then, some of the
personal items were lost, and the remains were reclassified as
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's investigation then reviewed the records for all
known casualties near An Loc, concluding earlier this year that the
remains likely belonged to one of nine Americans, all pilots or
crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Using the new tests, which were approved for use only in 1995,
the Pentagon compared a sample of mitochondrial DNA removed from
the pelvis last month with samples from maternal relatives of eight
of the nine. (There was no maternal relative of the ninth.)
</P>
<P>
   The sample matched Blassie's mother, Jean.
</P>
<P>
   For the other families, the uncertainties remain. Althea
Strobridge, the mother of Capt. Rodney Strobridge, said on Monday
night that while she was happy for the Blassies, nothing for her
had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Although Blassie's family believed from the start the remains
belong to him, the Pentagon's circumstantial evidence, including
the blood type, had made Strobridge the most likely other match.
The captain, a 30-year-old Army helicopter pilot, was shot down in
the same area and on the same day in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Mrs. Strobridge said she did not really want to open
the Tomb of the Unknowns to test the remains. Six years after
Strobridge disappeared, his family, including his mother and his
wife, Pat, held a memorial service and officially accepted his
death. A white gravestone was placed in his memory at Arlington,
not far from the Tomb of the Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Strobridge, who lives in Perry, Iowa, agreed to give
a sample of her blood for the tests. ``It brought it all back so
vividly,'' she said.

U.N. PLANS TO TREAT 30,000 HIV-INFECTED PREGNANT WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ In a new attempt to slow the transmission of AIDS from
mothers to their babies, the United Nations is launching a pilot
program to treat 30,000 pregnant women infected with HIV in 11
countries where the infection is spreading rapidly, U.N. officials
said at the 12th World AIDS Conference here Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which will focus on developing nations, mainly in
Africa, will offer testing to pregnant women and short-term therapy
with the drug AZT during late pregnancy and delivery.
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies have shown that short-term AZT therapy can
dramatically reduce the risk of a woman transmitting HIV to her
baby. Each year an estimated 2 million HIV-infected women worldwide
become pregnant, officials of the U.N. AIDS program said. About
680,000 babies were born with AIDS last year, thrusting
mother-to-child transmission to center stage at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   But as the U.N. program was announced at a news conference,
ACTUP-Paris, a French activist group, strongly attacked it as
unethical. Protesters argued that the program is far too limited,
because it provides treatment to women only during pregnancy and
not afterward.
</P>
<P>
   They also criticized organizers for not addressing the fate of
the children who will be born uninfected by HIV, but whose mothers
may soon die of AIDS. About 1.6 million children worldwide lost
their mothers to the disease in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. will be an orphan factory soon,'' Marie de Cenival of
ACTUP-Paris said. Ms. de Cenival and Gaelle Krikorian of
ACTUP-Paris charged in an interview that the United Nations was
submitting to pressure from the industrialized world to expand
their market for AZT and other drugs in the Third World.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to limit spread of the epidemic but we think it is a
political strategy and we want people to understand that,'' Ms. de
Cenival said. ``It is a wrong and cheap choice, and it is not going
to strengthen the health system in Africa,'' where 21 million of
the 30 million HIV infected people live.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Piot, who heads the U.N. AIDS program, other U.N.
officials and Dr. Bernard Kouchner, the French minister of health,
strongly defended the project against ACTUP-Paris' criticism.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the United Nations did not have enough money to
treat all HIV-infected pregnant women and had to act now, even if
the program created some orphans in the face of what Piot said was
a ``runaway epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS program has negotiated with AZT's manufacturer, Glaxo
Wellcome PLC, for a substantial reduction in the cost of the drug:
$50 for the course of AZT and $20 for testing. A short course of
treatment typically costs $800. Participants will receive free AZT
starting at the 36th week of pregnancy and during labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're off track,'' said Gregg Gonsalves, a spokesman for
Treatment Action Group, a New York City AIDS activist group, in
reference to ACTUP-Paris' position. ``We think it is a great
project.''
</P>
<P>
   In choosing project sites, the United Nations targeted areas
where women of childbearing age have high HIV infection rates and
where the local health system is strong enough to deliver a number
of measures needed to reduce mother-to-child transmission of the
virus.
</P>
<P>
   The projects will be in four countries (Ivory Coast, Tanzania,
Thailand and Uganda) where AZT trials showed that short-course AZT
treatment can reduce the risk of infection in newborns by about
one-half. In Thailand, such therapy reduced the risk to 9.4 percent
from 15.9 percent, Dr. Nathan Shaffer of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention said.
</P>
<P>
   The projects will also be conducted in seven other countries:
Botswana, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Honduras, Rwanda, Zambia and
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   Program officials must still overcome a number of hurdles,
including the spread of the AIDS virus through breastfeeding. A
third of HIV transmissions from mother to child in developing
countries are passed via nursing. The program, Piot said, will
offer counseling for infected women who choose not to breastfeed.
</P>
<P>
   Mercy E. Maklehemena, an HIV-infected South African woman whose
baby girl died of AIDS, inserted a personal note to the debate.
While not addressing the U.N. AIDS program directly, she criticized
doctors and drug companies for ignoring the impact of research
trials on women's lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women will move mountains to have a healthy baby,'' said Ms.
Maklehemena of Durban. ``Women will be motivated to enroll if they
are told the trials can save their baby's life. But, how do trials
protect or prolong women's lives?'' &QL;

 &HT;    Confusion reigns over new Florida abortion law
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ As of midnight, a form of late-term abortion
called particularly gruesome by foes became illegal in Florida. Or
perhaps most abortions became illegal.
</P>
<P>
   The confusion heralds the effective date of the state's
so-called ``partial-birth abortion'' ban, which finally is law
after lawmakers overrode Gov. Lawton Chiles' veto of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion-rights activists say the law is worded so vaguely that
it could reasonably be interpreted to ban any number of abortion
methods in even the first three months of a pregnancy, when a woman
currently has an absolute right to seek an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really trying to get rid of all abortions,'' said
Patricia Baird-Windle, who owns abortion clinics in both Melbourne
and West Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the new law _ the first restriction on a Florida
woman's right to an abortion in nearly a decade _ say that type of
argument was to be expected from abortion supporters and their
defenders, who will not brook even reasonable restrictions on
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say the law specifically targets a method known as
dilation and extraction _ in which a fetus is partially delivered
before it is killed by collapsing its skull _ that they call
tantamount to infanticide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a smokescreen to try and take the issue to something that
it is not,'' said state Sen. Anna Cowin, the Leesburg Republican
who sponsored the measure in the Senate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, however, do agree that the legal arguing over the
law that would put imprison a doctor for five years for performing
a partial-birth abortion is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy it's becoming law,'' said House sponsor Randy Ball,
R-Mims. ``But the battle certainly is just beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   No court has yet evaluated the law on its merits _ a status that
changes today when abortion-rights activists will argue before a
federal judge in Miami that the law violates federal guarantees of
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the legal machinations over the law have centered on how
it passed the legislature. House and Senate overwhelmingly approved
it in 1997. Chiles vetoed it, only to see both chambers override
him this spring.
</P>
<P>
   In between was the special session on school construction, which
Chiles now argues should have been the time for any veto overrides
to come up. By waiting until spring, Chiles argued to the Florida
Supreme Court, the legislature waited too long.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's failure to rule on that question by Monday
meant 60 days have passed since the end of this spring's session
and, under the state constitution, the overridden law takes effect.
</P>
<P>
   Cowin argues that she meant for her bill to apply only to
partial-birth abortions in the last three months of pregnancy, when
most abortions are illegal anyway. As to banning other forms of
abortion? ``That was never the intention,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   That, Baird-Windle said, is nonsense. ``They've never acted in
good faith in anything, ever,'' she said of abortion opponents,
many of whom blockaded her Melbourne clinic in years past. ``This
wording was part of their stealth attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Ball said there is no stealth attack: it is all out in the open.
Part of the strategy for banning partial-birth abortions, he said,
was to bring to the public a vivid description of what is done,
which isn't too much different than what is done in some other
abortion methods.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he'd like all abortions to be banned because he
believes they are murder. ``That's why there cannot be a
compromise,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether the partial-birth is the proverbial foot-in-the
door: ``I hope so,'' Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   And that is precisely what abortion-rights activists fear, and
why they plan to argue in court today that the partial-birth ban,
by its broadness, takes away some of the abortion rights guaranteed
by the U.S. Supreme Court Roe vs. Wade decision 25 years ago. The
law is the first abortion restriction in Florida since the parental
consent law that lasted two months before it was overturned in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   Charlene Carres, a Tallahassee abortion-rights lawyer who will
ask the federal judge to stop the new law from taking effect, said
most of the bans in the other 17 states that have passed them have
also been struck down by judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those judges can't all be reading it wrong,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition of Florida director John Dowless disagrees
with Carres' spin but agrees that a judge or judges somewhere,
state or federal, is liable to strike down the law. ``It's the last
bastion of liberalism left. And that's our courts,'' he said.

 &HT;    MacKay extends offer to Dantzler in hopes of unification
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Hoping to unify the party and avoid a
costly primary fight, Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay has asked his opponent,
former state Sen. Rick Dantzler, to become his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, barring any last minute glitch, is expected to
be made today at a news conference in Tallahassee, according to
senior Democrats knowledgeable about the decision.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay met with Dantzler for dinner Monday night in the state
capital to formally ask Dantzler to join the ticket. Early reaction
to the ticket was largely positive. One notable exception was state
Rep. Keith Arnold of Fort Myers who now finds himself MacKay's lone
opponent for the Democratic nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful,'' said state Sen. Tom Rossin, D-West
Palm Beach, a Dantzler supporter. ``It makes an awful lot of sense
to do this. Rick is liked by an awful lot of people who are
concerned about the future of the Democratic Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Diffenderfer, MacKay's Palm Beach County organizer, said
adding Dantzler to the ticket ``should quiet some of those factions
in the party who thought MacKay could not bring the party
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Dantzler, 42, is 23 years younger than MacKay and three years
younger than Jeb Bush, the likely Republican nominee. Supporters of
Dantzler, a quiet, soft-spoken lawyer from Winter Haven, say he
represents a new generation of Democratic leaders who can
aggressively challenge the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 1997 Dantzler has tried to sell that image to party
leaders, hoping they would embrace his candidacy for governor.
During his year-long campaign Dantzler said he liked and respected
MacKay but was convinced that MacKay would be unable to energize
the party and defeat Bush in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite early support from a number of his former Senate
colleagues, Dantzler's campaign was never able to hit its mark.
Hoping to raise $1 million early in his campaign to prove he would
be a strong candidate, Dantzler had just over $600,000 nine months
later with more than $400,000 of it spent.
</P>
<P>
   In attempt to prove his determination to win, Dantzler quit the
Senate in January, promising to campaign full time. Renting an
apartment in Broward County, a key Democratic area, Dantzler spent
much of his time there.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his efforts, however, Dantzler continued to have
difficulty raising money and recent polls showed him far behind
MacKay. By last week Dantzler, who had often said he was not
interested in being a running mate, began publicly saying he would
be willing to consider the job if it was offered.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party leaders are now hoping to convince Arnold to
quit the race and perhaps consider a bid for secretary of state
instead. Arnold had been counting on a three-way primary. He had
hoped that he could win enough votes in September to pass Dantzler
and force MacKay into runoff in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been planning a runoff strategy and this announcement
obviously changes all that,'' said Arnold, who must find his own
running mate by the July 17 deadline. Arnold had raised more than
$300,000 as of March 31 and has spent nearly all of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The smartest thing Keith Arnold could do right now is work
with the party to find something that would help him stay in public
life,'' said one top Democratic official. ``If he wants to help the
party he should let MacKay begin the job of campaigning against
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, Arnold is determined to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been pretty clear for the last few weeks that
MacKay and Dantzler were thinking about doing this,'' Arnold said.
``It makes it harder for me but the only way I'm certain to lose
this race is by getting out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cory Tilley, Bush's campaign spokesman, was dismissive of the
MacKay-Dantzler ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever Buddy MacKay picks is not going to hide the fact that
Buddy MacKay is out of touch with Florida voters,'' said Tilley.
``Having Rick Danztler on the ticket is not going to change that.''

ROOKIE INITIATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK WELCH  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The conversation bordered on intense as both
sides stood firm in stating their cases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the consultation with Angels third-base coach Larry Bowa
was just another day in the on-the-job learning process for Justin
Baughman, the Angels' 23-year-old rookie second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have so, so much to learn,'' Baughman said, ``and I have a
lot of questions sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowa _ known for his feisty ways as a shortstop with the
Philadelphia Phillies and the Chicago Cubs _ has been a key figure
in Baughman's rise to the big leagues. Just last season, Baughman
was playing shortstop at Class-A Lake Elsinore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justin had some merit to his thoughts,'' Bowa said of
Baughman's recent pregame tutoral. ``You want a player to stand up
and not just shake his head all the time in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a guy who is intense. Justin has all the tools to play
at this level for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Baughman's climb through the Angels' farm system has been swift
and surprising. The fourth-year pro jumped from Class-A to Triple-A
this season and was promoted to the majors last month.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman has solidified a position that was a big question mark
when Randy Velarde couldn't make it back from an elbow injury.
Veterans Carlos Garcia and Norberto Martin failed in their bids to
start.
</P>
<P>
   Baughman, regarded as the quickest player in the Angels'
organization, has hit .274 and has fielded his position well,
making just three errors in his first 30 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into the spring thinking that I'd be playing shortstop
at the Double-A level,'' Baughman said, ``so yes, you could say I'm
ahead of my timetable.''
</P>
<P>
   It was during spring training that Baughman grabbed the
attention of manager Terry Collins and Bowa. With Gary DiSarcina
set at shortstop, the Angels coaches' moved Baughman to second base
in the final week of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's doing just fine over there,'' Collins said. ``He's earned
the chance to play there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We liked his play at shortstop in the spring and then we
decided to take a look at him at second base for a couple of games.
We liked what we saw.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of what they liked about Baughman was the way he attacked
the position change, trying to learn as much as he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to Larry a lot and I watch a lot of things that Gary
DiSarcina does as well,'' Baughman said. ``If I can do some of the
things that Gary has done in his career, I'd consider myself a
successful person.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, who has played alongside a number of second basemen
since coming up to stay in 1991, likes Baughman's potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of upside,'' DiSarcina said. ``As far as being
an example for him, that's up to him. I go out and do my job every
day and if he watches what I do, then that's fine. I appreciate
that if he sees me in that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the toughness from Bowa and DiSarcina must have rubbed
off on Baughman. Earlier this season, Baughman took a line drive
off his face that required 60 stiches. He missed just five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys might have missed two, maybe three weeks,'' Bowa
said. ``He didn't want to come out, and who could blame him? He
wants to stay here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't see any need to sit out,'' said Baughman. ``I
didn't suffer any serious damage or anything and my instinct is to
play every day.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as he has accomplished in his short time in the major
leagues, Baughman admits that playing baseball at the highest level
can be overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't say it's intimidating, that's not the right word,''
Baughman said. ``But there is a lot to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Confidence is such a huge thing up here and I'm still trying
to build my own. It's an everyday thing. You could say I'm glad to
be here. Who wouldn't be? But the last thing I'll do is rest on it
and take it for granted.''

   National League All-Stars announced
</P>
<P>
   By Thomas Stinson
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 COX NEWS SERVICE
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Atlanta Braves have never had a shortstop voted
onto the All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss had gone 10 seasons without a sniff of the Mid-Summer
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   What a perfect fit.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss will join third baseman Chipper Jones to comprise the
starting left side of the National League infield next Tuesday,
when the 69th All-Star Game is played in Denver. St. Louis first
baseman Mark McGwire was the league's top vote-getter with 3.38
million votes, according to final NL balloting released by the
league Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the rest of the NL lineup are New York catcher Mike
Piazza, Houston second baseman Craig Biggio and outfielders Tony
Gwynn of San Diego, Barry Bonds of the San Francisco and Larry
Walker of Colorado. American League starters will be annouced this
afternoon, with pitchers to follow Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Only once in 1970 have the Braves had two players voted to start
in the All-Star game, with Hank Aaron and Rico Carty sharing the
outfield with Willie Mays that year. Former Brave shortstop Jeff
Blauser started in the 1997 All-Star game but was subsituting for
the injured Barry Larkin of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ''They only way you feel you belong is if the fans want you,''
said Jones, who made the NL team for the third time and started in
1996 for the injured Matt Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, who only once finished as high as second in the voting
(1989 in Oakland), drew 1.2 million votes to beat out Larkin by
162,389. Weiss was with ailing son Brody Monday night and
unavailable for comment, but around the league there was an
appreciation for an accomplishment made under duress.
</P>
<P>
   ''For this to happen in a year of crisis for his family is
rather ironic,'' said Colorado owner Jerry McMorris, a Weiss fan
from his Rockies days. ''Maybe this can be the start of a positive
period him. Most important, maybe Brody can start to get better.''

 &HT;    Krajicek to Sampras: Wake up
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Richard Krajicek wants to recommend a few
things to world No.1 Pete Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to start working, to wake up,'' Krajicek said after
both reached the fourth round of Wimbledon Monday. ``He has to
start winning some tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras has been in a slump most of the year, compiling just a
25-8 record with just two titles while acting lackadaisical about
his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at the road to Hanover, which is the ranking Jan.
1, he is the No.10 player,'' Krajicek said. ``He knows it himself,
that he has not done so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras bristled when asked about Krajicek's opinion that
Sampras rates 10th among players this year, although his words
don't reveal that.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff really doesn't faze me. I know my capabilities. I
know how I'm playing this week,'' Sampras said. ``My year has been
a little bit up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   His coach, Paul Annacone, also doesn't mind what others say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately for Pete he really only makes news when he
loses,'' Annacone said. ``The most important thing for me and for
Pete is accumulation of the 12 months. He's got plenty of time to
have a very high standard year.''
</P>
<P>
   He took another step toward a fifth Wimbledon title by advancing
to the fourth round despite the frustration of waiting for three
days to play. He defeated Thomas Enqvist 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3)
in a match originally scheduled for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long, long weekend,'' Sampras said. ``It's an
emotional roller coaster. You get up for playing, and you come off,
and you have a 20-minute delay. You come back, play a game. You
have (Sunday) off, which was kind of bizarre (that) they don't play
on middle Sunday. So you get the highs and lows.''
</P>
<P>
   Petr Korda (third seed), Goran Ivanisevic (14) and Tim Henman
(12) also advanced in the men's draw. Korda and Henman move to the
quarterfinals and Ivanisevic goes to the fourth round with
Krajicek, the ninth seed.
</P>
<P>
   Morariu loses: Corina Morariu, the St. Andrew's graduate now at
a career-high ranking of 37, made her best Grand Slam showing of
her career, despite losing to third seed Jana Novotna, 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Other seeded women advancing were Lindsay Davenport (2), Monica
Seles (6), Irina Spirlea (10), Dominique Van Roost (15) and Natalie
Tauziat (16). Seles is the only player to advance to the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Like Sampras, Novotna said rain delays upset her schedule.
``Nevertheless, after the rain delay I thought that I had started
to play much better and I have enjoyed myself very much and just
played a wonderful match.''

 &HT;    Injury forces Serena Williams to retire from match
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Serena Williams glared at the grass on
Court 13.
</P>
<P>
   It already had felled her once, straining her left calf, and she
wasn't happy with its slickness.
</P>
<P>
   Forty minutes later, the 16-year-old decided to bag Wimbledon,
retiring from her third-round match trailing 47th-ranked Virginia
Ruano-Pascual 7-5, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The move raised eyebrows because Serena said the injury came
early in the first set, but she didn't call a trainer for several
games and didn't retire until clearly getting in a hole.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about her sister's ``loss,'' Venus Williams might
have summarized what happened best.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't lose. She retired,'' said Venus, who advanced to
the fourth round by defeating Chanda Rubin 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Serena said she had hoped the injury would improve as the match
continued, but it didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at that moment in time, I could have carried on if I
wanted to, but I have to think about the future,'' said Serena, who
is ranked 20th in the world. ``I don't want to hurt myself over
something silly and be out for maybe two months just because I
didn't stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Her loss eliminated the inviting sister-sister fourth-round
matchup that many had hoped to see today. Seventh seed Venus, 18,
now plays Ruano-Pascual instead.
</P>
<P>
   The elder sister leads the rivalry 2-0, but they've never played
on grass. Monica Seles was among several experts who gave Serena
the edge on this surface because she moves better and plays a more
varied game.
</P>
<P>
   Serena was disappointed not to play her sister. But when Venus
was asked whether she was disappointed or relieved, she just
smiled, saying, ``I think I can't change what happened. So I have
to go on and just make sure that I do what Serena didn't do
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Serena's worst fall on the grass came when she was up 40-30 at
1-1. She was running behind the baseline near the edge of the court
when both feet slipped out from under her. She managed to get up
and hit a few more balls before sending a lob long.
</P>
<P>
   Ruano-Pascual won the next two points to break Serena's serve
for a 2-1 lead. Serena continued to slip and slide throughout the
match but the players held serve until Serena called for a trainer
after the ninth game.
</P>
<P>
   A WTA trainer examined her left calf just below the knee and
applied tape. Serena won the next game when Ruana-Pascual had been
serving for the first set, but the Spaniard won the next eight
straight points to take the set 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   Serena played well using a strong backhand slice and hitting the
lines often.
</P>
<P>
   Serena disagreed that Ruana-Pascual was a difficult opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think she played a good day (game) today,'' Serena
said. ``but I think that if I were in better shape it wouldn't have
been happening at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In the second set Ruana-Pascual stayed strong while Serena moved
little but didn't limp or look to be in pain. Ruana-Pascual won the
first four games before Serena held a service game for 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   As she left the court for the changeover, though, Serena told
the chair umpire she couldn't continue, which he announced.
</P>
<P>
   She then gathered her racquets and bags and walked off the court
without acknowledging her opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Ruana-Pascual looked around and shrugged, then stood up and
raised her arms. The crowd gave a quick round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I forgot,'' Serena said. ``I never really had to quit during a
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the rain and the late doubles match, Ruana-Pascual
was not available for interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Serena and Venus also had to withdraw from doubles competition
because WTA rules prohibit players who withdraw from singles to
play doubles in the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Serena can remain in mixed doubles because the match wasn't
scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Serena expects her leg will be fine soon. ``It's already feeling
a little better,'' she said. ``I don't think (the pain) was that
intense. Just maybe a little tight.''

GOVERNMENT PLANNING TO PRIVATIZE URANIUM ENRICHMENT OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Ky., Calif., Md., Texas)  (ps) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government's uranium enrichment
business, rooted in the development of the atomic bomb more than a
half-century ago, is expected to go on sale in the stock market
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Monday that they would try to privatize
the United States Enrichment Corp., which provides most of the
nuclear fuel used in this country.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to sell shares in the company, known as an initial
public offering, came after the government failed to get an
acceptable bid from any other private company to buy United States
Enrichment, which is widely viewed as an inefficient manufacturer
with antiquated technology, in a business suffering declining
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's unclear whether investors will want to own a
business that couldn't find a buyer, the stock offering is expected
to raise as much as $1.65 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The government has never attempting anything quite like this
before. In the short history of privatization in this country the
only sale remotely similar was that of Conrail, a collection of
failing Northeast railroads phe government took over and
subsequently sold in a 1987 stock offering for $1.65 billion. The
biggest-ever privatization was the sale of the Elk Hills petroleum
reserve in California to Occidental Petroleum Co. last October.
</P>
<P>
   United States Enrichment operates aging factories in Piketon,
Ohio, and Paducah, Ky., which employ about 5,500 people and had
1997 sales of $1.6 billion. It is also developing a laser-based
enrichment system at laboratories of the Energy Department, of
which it was once a part.
</P>
<P>
   USEC, with headquarters in Bethesda, Md., has a board comprised
of five directors appointed by the president and confirmed by the
senate. It is being advised by J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc. Its
privatization plans were approved by the Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Two groups had made offers to acquire the business. One included
Lockheed Martin, which currently operates the Piketon and Paducah
plants under contract, BWX Techhologies, formerly Babcock &AMP; Wilcox,
and the Carlyle Group, an investment firm. The second included
General Atomics, a San Diego company that has been in the reactor
and fuel-fabrication business, and Texas Pacific Group, a leveraged
buyout firm.
</P>
<P>
   The initial public offering's lead manager will be Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, USEC said in an announcement Monday, and
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. is the co-lead manager.
</P>
<P>
   People involved in the deal were generally reticent to speak
about it because of the Securities and Exchange Commission rules
limiting what can be said about business offered through stock
sales, but some pointed out that the authorizing legislation,
passed by Congress in 1992 and 1996, sets a variety of requirements
beyond price, including protecting public health and natural
security, and assuring a continued domestic enrichment industry.
</P>
<P>
   But some people in the industry said that the Treasury's asking
price was very high for an industry with uncertain prospects, and
for an old industrial complex poorly positioned to compete in that
industry. Demand for nuclear reactor fuel is lower than had been
expected, because fewer nuclear plants have been built than the
industry once expected, and because of a surplus of enriched
uranium because some weapons fuel, which is highly enriched, is
being diluted for reactor use.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is characterized by oversupply,'' said James
Cornell, president of Nukem, a German-owned company that is
involved in uranium enrichment, fuel fabrication and trading. ``The
million-dollar question is whether USEC will be able to raise the
kind of money they are looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treasury believes underwriters can sell 100 million shares
at $13.50 to $16.50 a share, and that USEC will be able to borrow
$550 million more from banks, of which $500 million would go to the
Treasury, for a total sale value in the range of $1.356 billion to
$1.65 billion. The Treasury could cancel the sale if the shares
cannot be sold at $13.50 or could accept a lower price, but doing
so would likely result in a challenge from the rejected corporate
bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential problem with the privatization is that some
critics say it will jeopardize a deal made during the Bush
administration for the United States to buy surplus Russian weapons
fuel. As part of that agreement, United States Enrichment said it
would buy the fuel from the Russians for $110 to $120 per unit, but
those units how have a market price in the $80 range. Keeping the
contract would guarantee a loss of money, a major concern for
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., complained in a letter on Friday to
Sandy Berger, the president's national security advisor, that it
might be time to reconsider the deal because of the contracts with
the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Rubin and Federico Pena, the Treasury and Energy
secretaries, said in a letter to Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, made
public Monday, that ``We expect USEC to continue meeting its
contractual oblgations after privatization'' and that if it did
not, the part of the Energy Department that is not being privatized
could step in and buy the enriched uranium. The sale would be ``one
of the largest privatizations in U.S. history,'' they wrote, and
would preserve more jobs than if the government continued to
operate the company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some opponents have been struggling for months against the
privatization because of the potential job impact. Rep. Ted
Strickland, D-Ohio, whose district includes Piketon, argues that
the Treasury and the Energy departments have not adequately
explained how the privatization will maintain a viable domestic
enrichment industry.
</P>
<P>
   The factories are confronting a number of problems. One is that
they use the oldest and most energy-intensive technology to enrich
uranium, gaseous diffusion. Newer competitors abroad use
centrifuges, which is less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   United States Enrichment once held 90 percent of the world
market, aggressive competitors abroad have taken a larger share,
leaving it with 40 percent of the world marked, though that
includes about 75 percent of the North American market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the long-term prospect is that demand would decline
as the reactor population dwindles.
</P>
<P>
   USEC's hope is a new technology, called Atomic Vapor Laser
Isotope Separation, allows enrichment with one-tenth as much
electricity. But it has not been commercialized and some people
doubt it will be, even though the government has invested $2
billion in the technique.

B.C. PREMIER BLASTS SALMON AGREEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Canada-Washington state salmon conservation agreement is
``inequitable'' and will be ``devasting for British Columbia
fishermen,'' B.C. Premier Glen Clark said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He said in an interview that British Columbia may renew legal
action in American courts against U.S. fisheries interests. He
hinted that the province could reconsider costly investments to
restore salmon habitat if the only result is fish for Americans to
catch.
</P>
<P>
   Clark was cut out of the accord that was announced Friday. It
was negotiated by Canada's federal fisheries minister, David
Anderson, and Gov. Gary Locke.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Monday he has discussed but not yet concluded a
similar short-term agreement with Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles.
Alaska-based fishermen have first crack at salmon bound for both
Pacific Northwest and British Columbia river systems.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Clark predicted that Canada will accept whatever Alaska
offers.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson defended the accord, under which U.S.-based
fishermen will ease pressure this year on coho salmon bound for the
Fraser River, while Canada takes measures to preserve chinook
salmon bound for Puget Sound waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fish move together, they swim together,'' Anderson said.
``If you do something to save your own salmon, you may benefit your
neighbor's stock. So be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark vowed to resist the accord, which he called ``a
travesty.'' The British Columbia government does not have authority
over fisheries. But Clark hinted that the province may seek redress
in American courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will examine any legal means available to us,'' he said.
``It may include reviving the court case we had in the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
   The province filed suit in federal court last year, seeking
damages for alleged overfishing of B.C.-bound salmon by Alaska
fishermen. The case was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Angry British Columbia fisheries interests were talking about
more direct action. At a news conference in Victoria, they
threatened to disrupt a U.S. Navy torpedo testing range located in
Canadian waters at Nanoose Bay north of Nanaimo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to drop anchor for a little while and have a
little picnic,'' said John Radosevic, president of the United
Fishermen and Allied Workers Union.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second hint of a possible hot summer on the B.C.
coast. Last month, Radosevic talked about possible delays against
passenger liners that use Vancouver as a takeoff point for cruises
to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The Anderson-Locke accord was reached after Anderson took
drastic action to save dwindling coho salmon runs of the Fraser
River, and the Skeena River in northern British Columbia. He cut
off the sport fishery for coho and curtailed both the commercial
and recreational fishing off the west coast of Vancouver Island.
</P>
<P>
   A byproduct of Canada's actions was to ease pressure on Puget
Sound chinook salmon, recently listed under the federal Endangered
Species Act. Locke was encouraged to approach Anderson with
proposals for additional conservation measures.
</P>
<P>
   Under the conservation deal, Washington will reduce by 22
percent the U.S. catch of Canadian coho. The cutback will allow an
additional 7,000 to 8,000 fish to spawn, although only at most 500
of the most endangered run in the Thompson River tributary of the
Fraser.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, Canada will cut back by 50 percent its catch of
U.S.-bound chinook. The cutback will save an estimated 14,000
chinook, a quarter of them from endangered wild salmon runs, said
Curt Smitch, Locke's chief fisheries adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Canada will undertake additional conservation measures next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``They agreed next spring to restrict the Georgia Strait sport
fishery, one of the plums they have left, which affects our chinook
stocks in the Nooksack and Stilliguamish rivers,'' Smitch said.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said Canada needed to save its coho runs, whether or
not the U.S. wanted to join in a conservation move. ``In so doing,
we substantially improved chances of survival of your Puget Sound
chinook,'' he said. ``The governor recognized this. He made a
gesture to help us, which he was not required to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The first gesture of peace in the four-year U.S.-Canada salmon
dispute has rekindled a war of words between the British Columbia
and Canadian governments.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said his province has committed to restoring
logging-ravaged salmon habitat, only to see Canadian fishermen bear
the brunt of sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government of British Columbia is spending $150 million
(Canadian) on watershed restoration and rebuilding salmon
streams,'' he said. ``If the taxpayers are spending that amount of
money, it is hard to justify if the Americans _ particularly in
Alaska _ are simply catching the fish.''
</P>
<P>
   Smitch said the state of Washington curtailed fishing for coho
and chinook long before the Canadian government took similar moves.
``We have already shut down our fishery (while) this is the first
year they've done it,'' he said. ``The consequences to the special
interests are wrenching.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the salmon war between the Canadian and British Columbia
governments, added Smitch, ``We don't understand politics up there
and we're not going to get in the middle of it.''
</P>
<P>
   But the state may already be in the middle of it. U.S. and
Canadian negotiators are trying to work out an agreement to share
the relatively abundant sockeye salmon runs of the Fraser River.
Many of the salmon swim through U.S. waters en route to the
Canadian river.
</P>
<P>
   Canada offered last week to allow Washington and Oregon to catch
as mcuh as 25 percent of Fraser River sockeye _ or an estimated
1.25 million fish. Clark has denounced the offer as excessive.
Canadian fisheries officials say the premier will be to blame if
there is no agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have until Wednesday to work out a sockeye
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran Victoria politician and conservationist, Anderson has
been on the firing line since he announced in May that stern
conservation measures were coming.
</P>
<P>
   He said Monday that while his policies have provoked furious
protests from Clark and fisheries lobbyists, the Canadian public
supports the need to protect weak salmon runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a wide understanding,'' he said. ``The
understanding extends to fisheries interests. It does not extend to
the paid leaders of interest groups, who relish conflict. It does
not extend to the British Columbia government, which believes that
confrontation with the federal government is good politics.''

THIRD CLAIMANT APPEARS AT HEARING OVER $21 MILLION TICKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM F. DOHERTY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRAINTREE _ The most confused and contentious fight in Lottery
history _ with a $21 million jackpot at stake _ took an incredible
twist Monday when a third claimant to the prize emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Sonia Bardakjian, 52, of Watertown, appeared at a hearing at
Lottery headquarters that had been scheduled to resolve the dispute
between 72-year-old Paraskeve Kantges and Nick Havan.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kantges, Bardakjian said she also telephoned in the winning
bet to Watertown Provisions, owned by Havan, along with 36 other
bets last Feb. 5.
</P>
<P>
   And like Kantges, Bardakjian said that when she went to the
store to pick up her tickets the next day, Havan gave her all the
tickets except the winning one.
</P>
<P>
   Havan has maintained that although Kantges may have telephoned
in the winning bet to Havan's store, she called back later to
cancel the bet and he purchased it for himself. He is appealing a
finding favor of Kantges by former Lottery executive director
Samuel M. DePhillippo.
</P>
<P>
   Bardakjian, a native of Lebanon, appeared at the hearing without
a lawyer, but accompanied by her daughter and a friend. Lottery
officials said she had filed a claim to the Mass Millions jackpot
on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   Bardakjian made an opening statement in which she said she
``jumped up'' with joy when she discovered her number had been
picked.
</P>
<P>
   She said she went to Watertown Provisions to pick up her
tickets, but Havan said she did not have the winning ticket. ``I
was so crying, I went home,'' said Bardakjian.
</P>
<P>
   Havan maintains that he, and neither Kantges nor Bardakjian are
the rightful owners of the Mass Millions ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Steadman, a retired Supeior Court judge, is hearing the
testimony and will make recommendations to the full Lottery
Commission. The dispute is likely to end up in the courts, however.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Bardakjian's appearance, Havan testified Monday that he
did not come forward and publicly claim the jackpot for several
days because he feared Kantges would cause dispute his claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew she would be very upset and demand the ticket from me,
I was not ready to disclose,'' Havan testified.
</P>
<P>
   Kantges, who is scheduled to testify Tuesday, denied she
canceled the bet. She said she had played the same number daily for
years. She claims it was one of about 90 lottery bets she made that
day, but it was the only one Havan did not turn over to her.
</P>
<P>
   When Havan told two lottery officials, who came to his store
several days after the drawing that Kantges had canceled the bet.
``They looked at me like I came from Jupiter,'' Havan said
</P>
<P>
   Havan also described an earlier dispute with Kantges over loud
music.
</P>
<P>
   When Kantges asked him to turn off disco music he was playing
because it was disturbing customers, Havan replied: ``What
customers? You are the only one here.''
</P>
<P>
   `I am a customer,'' she responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You call yourself a customer. You spent an hour in the store
and bought only a head of lettuce,'' Havan said he told her.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the exchange, he said Kantges boycotted the store
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, attorney R. Robert Popeo, representing
the Lottery, tried to show that Havan lied at a earlier hearing and
at a depostion when he claimed to have a bachelor's degree in civil
engineering from Wentworth Institute of Technology. Popeo presented
an affidavit from Wentworth stating the Havan had only an
associate's degree.
</P>
<P>
   Havan insisted he had a bachelor's degree and said he had given
it to his lawyer. Popeo demanded it be produced.
</P>
<P>
   Havan's lawyer, Laurence Johnson, dramatically parried the
attack by producing both the associate's and the bachelor's degree
from his briefcase.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ News Corp. said Monday that it planned to sell to the
public as much as 20 percent of its American film, television and
sports businesses _ including 20th Century Fox, Fox Television and
the Los Angeles Dodgers _ in an initial stock offering. The sale is
aimed in large part at bolstering the price of News Corp.'s shares,
which have lagged behind those of other media giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Murdoch is putting a window on some of the more developing
assets that may not earn very much but undoubtedly will have
considerable growth,'' said David Londoner, an analyst with
Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   A sale could also help News Corp. pay down some of its $8
billion in debt. And it would give the company a new stock that it
could use to make acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say how much 20 percent in the new company,
Fox Group, would be worth, analysts said, because the amount of
debt it would carry is not known. The businesses that make up the
Fox Group accounted for nearly $7 billion of News Corp.'s $11.2
billion in U.S. revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were enthusiastic about the planned offering, sending
the American depository receipts of News Corp. up 12 percent. The
ADRs _ each representing four shares of the Australian company _
closed up $3.5625, at $33.0625, after earlier touching a 52-week
high of $33.25.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. ADRs have been trading at about eight times cash
flow, compared with rivals Time Warner, Viacom and Walt Disney, for
example, which are trading at roughly 12 times cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's caution over News Corp. stems largely from the
fact that the company, which also owns HarperCollins, The New York
Post and newspapers in Britain and Australia, is seen as a
publishing and newspaper company as much as an entertainment
company, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up 40 percent over the past 18 months, but that compares
badly with Time Warner at 127 percent and Viacom at 73 percent,''
said Ed Hatch of UBS Securities. ``This will let investors directly
own News Corp.'s fastest-growing and most highly valued businesses
and remind investors that News Corp. owns 80 percent of those
businesses.''
</P>

   The market for new stock issues has cooled in the last month.
Still, News Corp.'s sale is expected by the end of the year, when
investors could be more receptive. More important, the move follows
several years of debt-paring by the company and could set the stage
for more acquisitions. Earlier this month, News Corp. sold TV
Guide, one of the crown jewels of its 1980s buying spree, for $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lyon, president of Institutional Capital, which manages
$12 billion and owns News Corp. preferred stock, noted that an
advantage of the Fox Group offering is that it frees News Corp. to
use the new stock for acquisitions. Analysts expect that the new
stock will trade at a higher multiple, and if that proves the case,
it would be a cheaper currency for making acquisitions. Moreover,
they note, Murdoch has always been an empire builder.
</P>
<P>
   And because News Corp. is selling only 20 percent to the public,
it will continue to be able to consolidate the Fox Group's profits
or losses at the parent company for tax purposes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As part of the deal, News Corp. is keeping its largest
money-loser _ Star-TV, its Asian cable-programming service _ at the
parent company. That operation is believed to have lost about $80
million in fiscal 1998, which ends Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Its more recent start-up operation, Fox News, which is still
losing money _ about $75 million a year, by Lyon's estimate _ will
be part of the new venture, along with Fox's 50 percent stake in a
host of regional sports services.
</P>
<P>
   Investors do not know the full value of the sports networks
because they are part of a joint venture that is 50 percent owned
by Liberty Media, a cable-programming company. Neither parent
reports the joint-venture numbers separately from other operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch estimates that the film studio, the television
production company and the 22 television stations are likely to
have 1999 cash flow of about $1 billion. If the company does trade
at a 12 multiple, like other media companies, 20 percent of that
would be $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's recent record has been stamped by the huge
success of ``Titanic,'' the $200 million budget for which was
financed by Fox and Paramount, which put in $65 million. So far the
film has grossed over $1 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Its new release, ``Dr. Doolittle,'' opened unexpectedly strong
over the weekend, taking in $29 million at the box office.
``Bulworth'' was a disappointment, but ``Hope Floats'' and ``The X
Files'' have been somewhat successful. Still, forecasting cash flow
from the unpredictable film business is always difficult.

PHYSIO-CONTROL IS MERGING WITH MEDTRONIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a merger that could one day make life-saving defibrillating
devices available for home use by people at risk for heart attacks,
Redmond, Wash.-based Physio-Control Corp. has joined forces with
Minneapolis-based medical giant Medtronic Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The merger, which is not expected to result in any layoffs for
Physio's 950 employees, could mean bigger markets for both players.
</P>
<P>
   Physio-Control is the market leader in automated external
defibrillators, devices that shock the heart back into normal
rhythm using an external shock applied through paddles. Medtronic
is the world's leading maker of pacemakers and other implantable
heart devices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good move for both companies,'' said Dr. David Gruber,
a physician and stock analyst with Vector Securities International
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The more patients who survive sudden cardiac arrest, the more
candidates there are for Medtronic's implantable devices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The $538-million stock merger gives Physio-Control the financial
resources to put its life-saving instruments into the hands of more
``first responders,'' those people that arrive first when someone
suffers a sudden heart attack.
</P>
<P>
   First-responders could be anyone from security guards in office
buildings, to family members at home with heart patients.
</P>
<P>
   The market for external defibrillators has traditionally been in
hospitals and emergency response vehicles, but advances in
technology have made it possible for even lay people to administer
the life-saving shocks.
</P>
<P>
   Physio-Control, which does about $173 million in sales with all
its product lines, has sold between 15,000 and 20,000 of its
Lifepak 500 devices for use by first-responders. But that only
scratches the surface of a market analysts estimate could be worth
in excess of $425 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're poised with the technology, but what has to happen is
the infrastructure to deploy it,'' said Richard Martin chairman and
chief executive officer of Physio-Control. ``By virtue of this
merger, we'll be able to accelerate the development of that
infrastructure.''
</P>
<P>
   The devices could one day be used anywhere people gather, or
emergency treatment might be needed, such as police cars, stadiums,
schools, commerical airlines, hotels and office buildings.
Eventually, it might also be used in homes for patients at high
risk for coronary artery disease.
</P>
<P>
   The survival rate for people who suffer sudden cardiac arrest
outside a hospital is currently less than 5 percent, but it's
highly time dependent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is critical,'' Gruber said.
</P>
<P>
   Sudden cardiac arrest is usually caused by ventricular
fibrillation, which is when the heart muscle starts quivering and
fails to pump blood to the brain and vital organs. The chance of
survival drops about 10 percent for every minute before the patient
can be ``defibrillated'' or shocked back to a normal rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   There are between 350,000 and 400,000 deaths from sudden cardiac
arrest each year in the United States and about 1 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The American Heart Association is pushing to increase the
survival rate from such heart attacks to 25 percent within the next
decade, through increased use of automated external defibrillators
and better public education.
</P>
<P>
   News of the merger sent Medtronic and Physio stock spiking
upward. Medtronic stock closed Monday at $115, up $3. Physio stock
closed at $26.25, up $3.25.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the merger, Physio-Control shareholders will
receive $27.50 _ a 20 percent premium over Friday's close _ in the
form of Medtronic stock for each share of Physio-Control they hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a positive development for Physio and its employees,''
said Andrew Jay, analyst with Bankers Trust New York.
</P>
<P>
   The deal follows another recent acquisition in the heart market.
Last December, Hewlett-Packard Co. bought out Seattle-based
Heartstream, which also makes automated external defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   The Physio-Control merger was unrelated to that acquisition,
analysts said. It grew out of an inquiry from Medtronic, which has
a history of growing through mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Physio-Control, which was founded in 1955 and is one of the
Seattle area's largest medical instrument makers, had been looking
at acquisitions of its own to try to find
</P>
<P>
   ways to expand its markets, Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Merging with Medtronic, which has strong international sales,
will also help build Physio's market overseas, analysts said.
Medtronic, which has about 13,500 employees worldwide, does about
$3 billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   The merger isn't expected to affect Physio-Control's
manufacturing facilities in Redmond. About 70 percent of the
company's employees work on the Eastside.
</P>
<P>
   Because the two companies' products are complementary and don't
overlap, there will not be any consolidation, said Art Collins,
president and chief operating officer of Medtronic. If the merger
is approved, Martin will report to Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Physio-Control already has done much of the basic streamlining
that frequently accompanies mergers, Collins said. ``The company
has been operating profitably and very well.''

ROCKWELL TO CUT 3,800 JOBS AND SPIN OFF CHIP UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rockwell International Corp.'s transformation to
commercial electronics from the military business suffered a
setback Monday when the company announced that it would spin off
its semiconductor division to shareholders, cut 3,800 jobs and take
a pretax charge of $625 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell, which made the B-1 bomber and the Space Shuttle, had
been counting on the electronics business, which it saw as fast
growing and glamorous, to carry it into the future. Rockwell had
sold its military and aerospace businesses to Boeing Co. in 1996
for $3.2 billion and spun off its auto parts business last year
into a publicly traded company, Meritor Automotive Inc.
</P>
<P>
   But while fast-growing, electronics, particularly
semiconductors, can be extremely volatile. Rockwell, which is based
in Costa Mesa, Calif., had been buffeted by plunging prices and
slower than expected sales growth for personal computer modems, for
which it is a major supplier of chips.
</P>
<P>
   Losses in the semiconductor division and pressure from
shareholders led Rockwell to conclude that it did not have the
stomach after all for boom and bust cycles and that the chip
business did not mesh that well with its other, somewhat more
predictable, businesses _ industrial automation equipment and
avionics.
</P>
<P>
   ``These really are different businesses,'' Don H. Davis,
chairman and chief executive, said today in an interview. Asked why
Rockwell had not seen that a year ago, he pointed to the modem
market. ``We saw prices drop significantly more than we ever
thought they would at the time and that changes the dynamics of the
whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the losses in its chip division, Rockwell's
largest business, it is experiencing flat sales, in part because of
the economic problems in Asia. While its avionics business remained
strong, Rockwell said it would report lower than expected profits
for the third fiscal quarter, which ends Tuesday, the second
consecutive quarter in which it has had earnings below estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Not counting the special charge, Davis said, earnings for the
quarter were expected to be 30 cents a share, including the
semiconductor business. But counting only continuing operations,
earnings will be 45 cents a share compared with 56 cents in last
year's third quarter. Analysts had expected earnings of about 68
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Sales for continuing operations will be about $1.7 billion, up 5
percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year, the company expected earnings a share from
continuing operations of $2.30 compared with last year's $2.12, on
sales of about $6.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the sluggish earnings, Davis, a company veteran
who took over as chief executive last October and as chairman in
February, Monday announced a major corporate overhaul, which he
predicted will result in pretax savings of $100 million in fiscal
1999 and $200 million annually starting in 2001. Investors greeted
the announcements with cautious optimism as the stock, which has
fallen much of this year, climbed 56.25 cents, to $49.
</P>
<P>
   Lior Bregman, an analyst with CIBC Oppenheimer, said that
Rockwell resisted divesting its chip business at a time when it
could have been sold for a high price. Now, ``they are doing it out
of weakness rather than strength.'' He also speculated that the
avionics or automation business might be divested at some point in
the future because they did not seem to fit together well either.
</P>
<P>
   The worker cutbacks, primarily in the automation business,
amounted to more than 9 percent of the 41,000 Rockwell employees
not in the semiconductor business. The chip division, which has
7,000 employees, is likely to have its own revamping later, though
officials said there will not be too many layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The $625 million charge included $275 million of intangible
asset writeoffs and goodwill mainly related to the company's
Reliance Electric motor business and $160 million for severance
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The new semiconductor company, which does not yet have a name,
will have revenues of about $1.3 billion, making it a midsized chip
company.
</P>
<P>
   The chip division had been a part of Rockwell for about 30
years. But it became a significant part of the company only in the
last few years, with the divestiture of the aerospace and auto
business, and with the boom in the sale of modems because of the
popularity of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sales in the semiconductor division tripled from $530 million in
fiscal 1993 to $1.59 billion in fiscal 1996 before leveling off in
1997. Modem chips account for about half the division's sales.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers had been hesitant to buy modems because of a
format battle that erupted last year between Rockwell and a rival,
U.S. Robotics, which is now part of the 3Com Corp. Even though they
have now agreed on a standard for the new modems, operating at 56
kilobits a second, sales have not fully recovered and prices have
remained weak.

REBEL SUCCESSES IN KOSOVO WORRY EUROPEANS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The surprising strength of ethnic Albanian rebels
fighting for independence in the Serbian province of Kosovo is
putting strains on international efforts to keep the violence from
spreading, European and American diplomats said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a major shift of emphasis after weeks of European and
American threats to use NATO military power to stop Serbia's
attacks on the rebels, the 15 countries of the European Union
called on the Albanians on Monday to reject ``violence and acts of
terrorism,'' too, and commit themselves to a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
   European Union foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg also
repeated European and American threats to use force if the Yugoslav
president, Slobodan Milosevic, continued to flout international
demands to halt his attacks and withdraw military and police units
that have inflicted heavy casualties on civilians.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany, a key player in efforts to keep the fighting from
spreading, said it was no longer insisting on withdrawal of Serbian
troops from the combat zones as a condition for resuming talks
between the rebels and Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were suspended after the Serbian offensive began early
last month. As recently as two weeks ago, a key demand on Milosevic
for getting the talks restarted was withdrawal of security units
used against ethnic Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The change in emphasis reflects the rebels' rapid seizure of
more than a third of Kosovo's territory, partly with arms and
soldiers moved in from Albania, according to European officials.
</P>
<P>
   French and German diplomats said that they were taken by
surprise by separate meetings last week with people claiming to be
representatives of the Kosovo Liberation Army by two American
special envoys, Richard Holbrooke and Robert Gelbard.
</P>
<P>
   Knowledgeable American officials said that Holbrooke's decision
to talk with the Kosovo fighters last week reflected the rapidly
changing military situation there. ``The Europeans didn't act fast
enough to get Milosevic to stop the attacks, so the rebels poured
troops and arms in,'' a U.S. official said. ``Now we have a new
situation to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   An official in Bonn said on Monday that his country would push
the United States, Russia and the other European countries
monitoring the situation in Kosovo to make clear to both the rebels
and Milosevic when the international group next meets in Bonn on
July 8 that the only real condition now for restarting talks should
be a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we keep insisting on a Serbian troop withdrawal before
political talks resume, that could lead to a mass exodus of the
Serbian population,'' the official said. Reports from Kosovo say
the rebels have kidnapped and fired on Serb civilians there and
have tried to drive them out of rebel-controlled territory.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the European foreign ministers made their most direct
appeal yet to rebel military leaders to stop the fighting. Even now
they prefer to deal with the ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, who supported a nonviolent approach in Kosovo while
fighting was raging in nearby Bosnia. But, European diplomats said,
Rugova's authority has been undermined as fighting spread.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those in a leadership role in the Kosovar Albanian
community should unite responsibly in making clear their commitment
to dialogue and a peaceful resolution of the problems of Kosovo,
and their rejection of violence and acts of terrorism,'' the
foreign ministers said.
</P>
<P>
   They also reminded both the rebel leaders and Rugova that Europe
was opposed to independence for Kosovo, instead supporting ``a
large degree of autonomy'' for it within Yugoslavia. Although 90
percent of Kosovo's population is ethnic Albanian, it is
historically Serbian territory. Serbia dominates what remains of
Yugoslavia, and Milosevic, a former president of Serbia, remains
its paramount leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans, unsettled by the American meetings with rebel
military leaders, have also taken initiatives of their own. After a
meeting between Rugova and a German foreign ministry official,
Wolfgang Ischinger, in Bonn last Thursday, Rugova agreed that he
could start talks with the Belgrade leaders again provided there
was a cease-fire, a German diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Russia, France, Italy, Britain, and Germany,
joined by Japan and Canada, agreed in London on June 12 that Serbia
could find itself threatened with NATO military action if it did
not call off the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia is not yet ready to let the U.N. Security Council,
where it has a veto, give NATO the go-ahead. And France, a NATO
ally, has indicated it might block military action by the alliance
unless the Security Council gave its approval.
</P>
<P>
   France joined other NATO defense ministers early this month in
calling for military contingency plans for a range of operations,
including air strikes against Serbian strategic targets in Kosovo
and beyond, to step up pressure on Milosevic to call off the
offensive.

ARGUING ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE, STARR AND WHITE HOUSE CHANGE
COURSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The issue of the potential impeachment of President
Clinton served as the backdrop Monday to a historic legal fight
over the attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a page from the independent counsel, the White House
argued that the potential impeachment of the president made the
privilege a crucial matter, while while Kenneth Starr argued that
the possibility of impeachment was too remote to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   While the competing views put forward by the two sides in a
federal appeals court hearing Monday on the immediacy of
impeachment appeared at first-blush to be counter-intuitive, they
made sense in the framework of the legal fight that has arisen in
the Lewinsky inquiry over the parameters of the lawyer-client
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The White House maintained that because Starr had recently told
the Supreme Court that he might file an impeachment report to
Congress, President Clinton was entitled to receive confidential
advice from his government lawyers in the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unusual twist, Starr walked away from what he had said
about an impeachment report, telling the three-judge panel that the
president was not entitled to keep the advice confidential because
impeachment was too remote an issue.
</P>
<P>
   The case focuses on the issue of whether Clinton can receive
confidential advice from government lawyers in a criminal inquiry.
Since both the White House and the independent counsel maintained
Monday that Clinton could use such lawyers to defend himself in an
impeachment inquiry in Congress, the argument focused in part on
the likelihood and timing of such a prospect.
</P>
<P>
   The White House lawyer, W. Neil Eggleston, contended that since
Starr had raised the prospect of an impeachment proceeding, the
president had every right to rely on government lawyers to defend
himself, as a matter of the constitutional principle of separation
of powers.
</P>
<P>
   As it became clear in the argument that the president stood on
firmer legal ground in a congressional inquiry, rather than in
grand jury proceeding, Starr told the appeals court there was no
need to consider impeachment issues. Instead, Starr urged the
judges to focus on whether they really wanted to put their
endorsement on the White House's position, establishing a rule that
every federal government lawyer would have a legal obligation to
forward evidence of a crime to investigators, except for White
House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The case arose when the president appealed a lower court
decision ordering one of his closest aides, deputy White House
counsel Bruce Lindsey, to answer questions before a federal grand
jury about conversations that he had with Clinton and other
witnesses, including Vernon Jordan, who helped Ms. Lewinsky to find
a job in New York. Clinton, Jordan and Ms. Lewinsky are involved in
the independent counsel's investigation trying to determine if
there was an attempt to cover up the President's relationship with
the former White House intern when her deposition was sought in the
sexual harassment lawsuit brought by Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   In the public phase of Monday's hearing, the judges sharply
questioned both sides, invoking lessons from the Watergate and
Iran-Contra scandals but giving few hints about their positions.
The panel, which also held a closed hearing on the more sensitive
grand jury aspects of the appeal, consisted of A. Raymond Randolph,
Judith W. Rogers and David S. Tatel. To each lawyer, Tatel asked
whether the President had any special rights to confidential advice
from White House lawyers in impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Eggleston, the president's top lawyer for privilege issues,
replied that ``in a run-up to possible impeachment,'' it was beyond
question as a matter of Constitutional law that the president
should be able to rely on the confidential advice of government
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The independent counsel has said in his Supreme Court brief
that a referral of impeachment is certainly under consideration,''
Eggleston said. ``Impeachment involves an official function. It
would be incumbent on the President to defend himself if he
believes it appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr replied that the prospect of impeachment was too
remote a possibility to be considered by the court, and that the
judges should only focus on the fact that the White House was
seeking to limit grand jury testimony, not testimony in a
congressional proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   In a concession that surprised some White House lawyers, Starr
told the judges that government lawyers ``could actually represent
the president in an impeachment setting.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's not where we are,'' Starr hastened to add. ``It is
premature for this court to look down the road and look at
impeachment. It is beyond the compass of this case.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The position of the office of the president misunderstands the
vision of what it means to be a government lawyer,'' Starr told the
three-judge panel, citing a federal law that requires federal
employees to report any evidence of a crime to the attorney
general. ``If there is wrongdoing, it must be exposed.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr first raised the prospect of an impeachment proceeding
four weeks ago. In a brief asking the Supreme Court to bypass the
appeals court and take the case on an expedited basis, Starr wrote
of the urgency of a final decision so that he could quickly proceed
with possible indictments and possibly send an impeachment report
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The court turned down Starr's request and suggested that the
appeals court consider the matter quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Under the independent counsel law, Starr must report any
``substantial and credible information'' that ``may constitute
grounds for impeachment'' to the House. The Constitution then gives
the House the authority to decide whether to recommend an
impeachment trial, which would be held in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments over impeachment and the attorney-client privilege
were unusual in part because the Justice Department has broken
ranks with the White House, and in a friend of the court brief,
taken an intermediate position between that of the president and
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has argued there is no privilege for government lawyers to
withhold evidence from a federal grand jury. The White House argued
that there is an absolute privilege. The Justice Department, in a
brief signed by Attorney General Janet Reno, asserts that there
should be a qualified privilege which a federal judge should
balance against the needs of investigators.

<P>
   BELACEVAC, Yugoslavia _ Thousands of Serb special police units
and troops, backed by artillery and tanks, opened a series of
attacks against separatist rebel positions on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy armored personnel carriers unleashed volleys at trenches
and checkpoints held by lightly armed Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas in the mining town of Belacevac, six miles west of
Pristina, the provincial capital. Serb gunners also attacked
Lapushnik, where rebels have barricaded the main road leading from
Pristina to Pec.
</P>
<P>
   Trucks and jeeps, packed with soldiers in green-camouflage
battle dress sped to the two fronts.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbians reported that an 8-year-old ethnic Albanian boy had
been killed and a man wounded. More than 8,000 people were forced
to flee their homes in Belacevac and take refuge in nearby woods.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats say the attacks end the latest diplomatic
effort to negotiate a cease-fire and could see the fighting spread
to new areas, including Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs believe this is the final offensive,'' said a
Western military observer. ``But this is the third attempt since
March by the Serbian security forces to wipe out the rebels. Each
attempt has only brought an escalation of the fighting. So will
this one.''
</P>
<P>
   From the top of a 50-foot slag heap at the southern edge of
Belacevac on Monday drifting clouds of charcoal-colored smoke could
be seen spiraling up from burning houses in the neighboring village
of Hade. Armored vehicles could also be seen moving swiftly along
the town's deserted streets. Rifle fire and mortar rounds
reverberated across hay fields.
</P>
<P>
   At a Serb police checkpoint about a mile outside Lapushnik, a
hamlet a mile south of Negrovce, houses were afire and explosions
could be heard. A barricade of cars and cement blocks at Lapushnik,
manned by rebel fighters with rocket-propelled grenades, blocks the
road to Pec and has cut off the Serb-held town of Kijevo for seven
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   American envoy Richard Holbrooke, who spent four days last week
trying to broker a cease-fire in Kosovo, called Kijevo ``the most
dangerous place in Europe,'' warning that a Serb effort to push
into the town and free it from rebel encirclement could lead to ``a
general war.''
</P>
<P>
   The police closed the main road from Pristina to Pec soon after
dawn. Policemen on the road to Belacevac near Obilic, northwest of
Pristina, were joined by an angry collection of heavily armed Serb
civilians, many of whom said they had been pushed out of their
homes by the rebels in recent days. The Serbs, who jeered foreign
reporters, appeared to be gathering to enter the mining town after
the assault by the military and the police. Streams of residents
were fleeing the fighting on foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is war,'' said one elderly woman, who did not want to give
her name, as she clutched a small nylon bag with a few belongings.
``We have become Bosnia.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Belgrade to make a push against rebel positions
follows efforts by the United States to broker a cease-fire accord
and halt the fighting that erupted in the Serbian province in
March. But neither Belgrade nor the rebel army, which controls
about 40 percent of the province, were willing to make concessions.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has threatened to carry out air strikes if Belgrade does
not withdraw its forces and end attacks, but there was no immediate
indication that this latest assault would lead to intervention.
There is also a concern among diplomats that continued fighting
could set off a wider regional war that would draw in Albania and
Macedonia, which has a restive ethnic Albanian minority.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In March, Serb forces surrounded an area known as the Drenica
triangle where rebel bands, numbering no more than a couple of
hundred, operated with impunity. The special police shelled
villages like Prekaz into rubble and killed over 80 people, more
than half of them women, small children, and the elderly. The
attack produced a province-wide rebellion, ending the peaceful
resistance movement led by the ethnic Albanian leader Ibrahim
Rugova.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of fighters have since flocked to the rebel movement
and tons of weapons and ammunition have been ferried by pack horses
over the border from northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago Serb forces moved again in force against villages
along the border with northern Albania, pounding homes into rubble
and displacing some 80,000 people. Streams of refugees fled into
Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. ambassador to Montenegro, Christopher Hill, who is
trying to negotiate between the ethnic Albanian leadership and
Belgrade, met on Monday with the president of Yugoslavia, Slobodan
Milosevic, and with ethnic Albanian leaders in Pristina. Hill and
Holbrooke had hoped to get the rebels to remove barricades along
main roads and use the move to hold off a massive Serb assault. The
rebels, however, refused to consider the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that after the rebels suffer some serious losses
they will be in the mood to negotiate,'' said a Western diplomat,
``but for now they seem to want to fight. There is little we can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   There were signs over the past few days that a huge
counter-insurgency sweep was being planned. The Serbs, who are
spending over $2 million a day to keep forces deployed in Kosovo,
moved about 50 tracked armored vehicles into positions around
Belacevac on Saturday morning and have deployed hundreds of
reinforcements in the province. Serb soldiers have also set up
anti-aircraft batteries around the airport and on hilltops in case
of a NATO air attack.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, tense groups of Serb soldiers fired at a
barricade made out of old, rusted mine equipment set up and manned
by rebel soldiers in Belacevac.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels took over the huge open pit coal mine last week and
kidnapped several Serb mine workers, halting all mine production.
</P>
<P>
   Belacevac and a neighboring mine, Dobroselo, provide the coal to
power two massive electric generating plants at Obilic. The plants
supply power to Kosovo, parts of Serbia and Macedonia. Huge
conveyor belts, now idle, channeled the coal to the plant from
Belacevac.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the mine was one of the most flagrant challenges
to Belgrade's authority. It saw guerrillas, often in berets and
black uniforms, checking documents of passing cars within a half a
mile of a sprawling army base with the city skyline behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know there is an attack coming,'' said a bearded rebel on
Sunday night, ``and we have moved our forces into the hills to
respond. Don't worry, the war is far from over. This is only the
beginning. We will see you in Pristina.''

 By JOHN P. LOPEZ  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MONTPELLIER, France _ Suddenly and shockingly, Mexico found itself
in the most uncomfortable and precarious position it had known in
this World Cup tournament.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was winning.
</P>
<P>
   It was the attacked, not the prideful attacker. Thanks to yet
another memorable goal by Luis Hernandez in the opening moments of
Monday's second half at Stade de la Mosson, Mexico was the team in
control, and mighty Germany was forced to the brink of elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole world thought we would be overwhelmed,'' Mexican
goalkeeper Jorge Campos said. ``We had the Germans running. We had
them running in circles.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, Germany started running like the smooth machine the
world has come to know.
</P>
<P>
   The team that prides itself on never being denied wasn't, as
veterans Juergen Klinsmann and Oliver Bierhoff each punched in a
well-placed late goal and knocked out Mexico 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came in with high expectations, and it looked like we would
achieve them,'' said Mexican coach Manuel Lapuente, whose team came
from behind in all three of its first-round World Cup games. ``But
just when we were flying, they clipped our wings.''
</P>
<P>
   Klinsmann, in his third World Cup tournament, finally broke
through Campos' great game in goal and set the large flag-waving
contingent of German fans partying in the 75th minute. After
Mexican defender Pavel Pardo misplayed an entry pass by the
Germans, failing to clear the ball as Klinsmann charged forward,
Klinsmann popped in the tying score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only mistake we made in front of goal,'' said
Campos, who otherwise had probably his best game of the tournament,
knocking away at least two first-half shots that looked like
certain goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not an easy game for us,'' German coach Berti Vogts
said. ``Mexico had an excellent plan, and their players gained
confidence when they got the 1-0 lead. But our first goal got us
going.''
</P>
<P>
   And the second goal, which came more because of Bierhoff's
excellence in the air than a mistake in the Mexican defense, came
in the 86th minute, sending the Germans to the quarterfinals and a
game against the winner of today's Romania-Croatia match.
</P>
<P>
   Bierhoff made a terrific play on the game-winner, giving Campos
no chance as he ripped a header in off a well-placed long pass from
Ulf Kirsten.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock when Mexico scored and we were losing, but we
tried to keep the fighting spirit,'' Klinsmann said. ``We never
lost confidence, but we were in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Vogts: ``I've played against Mexico quite a bit in my
career. I knew what to expect from them. I knew they would be very
tough. But I have never seen a Mexican team play with that kind of
passion. I never want to go through that kind of game again.''
</P>
<P>
   For Mexico, the only questions after the long, entertaining game
were what-ifs.
</P>
<P>
   After Hernandez gave his team the surprising lead in the 47th
minute when he blasted in the goal off a nice pass from Cuahtemoc
Blanco, Mexico had at least two more legitimate chances to score.
Just one more goal would have given Mexico the luxury of dropping
into defense to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   The best opportunity came in the 65th minute, when Jesus
Arellano made a terrific sprint through the middle of the German
defense and fired a shot that hit the post. The ball ricocheted to
Hernandez, who had an open net to his right but wheeled and hit the
ball directly at German goalkeeper Andreas Kopke.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you turn and shoot, it's just reaction,'' Hernandez said.
``If I would have reacted differently, I would have hit it to the
open side. I just hit it to the wrong place. I think if it was 2-0,
we would have won.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Mexican team goes home after clearly exceeding all
pre-tournament expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very sad in the locker room after the game because it
was a game we could have won. But we knew we did everything we
could,'' Mexico's Luis Garcia said. ``Germany always is going to
fight to the end, and they did that today. They went 90 minutes and
won it at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hernandez, one of the surprise stars of France '98 with
four goals scored: ``We leave with pride, but we don't leave
satisfied. If we had the trophy, we would be satisfied.''

ANALYSIS: CLINTON, STARR PLAYING SAME GAME ... WAITING FOR MONICA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CLINTON-STARR) 
(nk) 
 By JAMES BENNETT c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A year ago Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater
independent counsel, insisted that he was not out to dig into
President Clinton's ``personal life.'' That, of course, was then.
</P>
<P>
   Before a grand jury last week, one of Starr's prosecutors asked
Sidney Blumenthal, a senior White House aide, if he had ever
discussed with Hillary Rodham Clinton whether her husband had a
``sex addiction,'' Blumenthal said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   By Blumenthal's account, the jurors, who have no doubt heard a
great deal of titillating testimony by now, did not bat an eye at
the question, to which, he said, he answered no.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's new interest, if not its intensity, can be explained. A
year ago, after all, he had surely never heard of Monica Lewinsky
and had no inkling of the accusations of perjury and obstruction of
justice that would transform his green-eyeshades investigation of
an Ozarks real estate deal into a tabloid television sensation.
</P>
<P>
   More than five months after the Lewinsky accusations were
disclosed, head-snapping and sometimes baffling swerves in
direction have become the norm in this investigation, as well as in
the press accounts of it. Even the broadest contours of the story,
as publicly glimpsed in grand jury appearances and press accounts,
keep shifting.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of news accounts has trended in the president's
favor, but those most closely involved in the investigation and the
president's defense tend to roll their eyes at incremental press
reports. For them, only one game really matters here now.
``Everybody's waiting for Monica,'' is how one of the president's
allies summed it up recently, referring to nervous anticipation
over what agreement for testimony she might negotiate with
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   No one outside Starr's office knows if his investigation is
floundering or bounding ahead, although it is easy enough to spot a
former White House official or a former prosecutor on television
describing it one way or the other.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Linda Tripp, the famously hidden hand on the
``record'' button, has her first day here before the grand jurors,
who have already listened to the 20 hours of covert tapes she made
of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, several press accounts suggest, demonstrate that
Clinton tried to obstruct justice by covering up his relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky, getting her a job in New York among other
measures.
</P>
<P>
   Or else they demonstrate no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News &AMP; World Report said last week that Ms. Tripp's tapes
might actually protect the president from charges of obstruction,
rather than implicate him as Newsweek had previously reported. U.S.
News said it had ``reviewed the contents'' of tapes suggesting that
Ms. Lewinsky was hoping for help in finding a job from Clinton two
months before she was subpoenaed to testify for Paula Jones' sexual
misconduct suit. It was that subpoena that supposedly motivated
Clinton to find her a job, to keep her on his side.
</P>
<P>
   As the magazine's publicity people went to work (even some
lawyers here have publicity people now, by the way), Washington
began buzzing with the supposition that Starr was having trouble
proving his obstruction case. But the magazine's article did not
quite deliver the goods. Newsweek, U.S. News sniffed, had had
access to only 90 minutes of the tapes. But U.S. News did not get
much more. It said that it had ``reviewed the contents'' of
``roughly two hours of new tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves roughly 16.5 hours of tapes whose contents have gone
unreviewed by any publication. Goodness knows what Ms. Lewinsky may
have said. As U.S. News acknowledged in its report, the two hours
of tapes that it reviewed were silent on some of the central issues
of obstruction, such as who wrote the ``talking points'' that Ms.
Lewinsky is said to have provided to Ms. Tripp to coach potential
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the article did provide revelations, of a sort. U.S. News
said the source of its portion of tapes ``had no ideological or
commercial motivation to favor the president, the independent
counsel or any other party in the dispute.'' In the news business,
that is known as ``burying the lead.'' In this city of inveterate
ax-grinders, the discovery of such a person with ties to the
Lewinsky imbroglio would have made a compelling man-bites-dog
headline.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Clinton tried to obstruct justice is not the only issue
that is being regularly reinterpreted, or guessed at. There is also
the matter of what kind of sex he and Ms. Lewinsky had, if any.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Dale Young, a businesswoman from Scarsdale, N.Y., who
is a friend of Ms. Lewinsky and her mother, Marcia Lewis, paid a
visit to the grand jury here in response to a subpoena. She
provided an account of conversations she had had with Ms. Lewinsky
about the president that was reported this week by Newsweek and
confirmed by her lawyer, John Verni _ who dryly observed Monday
that he now understood what this ``media frenzy'' was that he kept
hearing about.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young concluded from a conversation with Ms. Lewinsky that
she had had an intimate relationship with Clinton that amounted to
foreplay and nothing more, Verni confirmed. Both Ms. Lewinsky and
Clinton have denied a sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young's version is a far cry from some of the early reports
about sex in the Oval Office. But it is of course hearsay, and not
definitive.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, her testimony does not seem to have deflected
Starr from his inquiry into the president's sexual behavior and
attitudes, judging from Blumenthal's account of his testimony.
Starr's office did not respond to a phone message today but in the
past has declined to comment on Blumenthal's testimony or any
other.
</P>
<P>
   In two recent visits to the grand jury, Blumenthal said, he was
asked, ``Does the president believe that oral sex is sex?'' and
``Does the president's religion include sexual intercourse?''

HENMAN UPLIFTS LOCALS; SERENA WILLIAMS BAILS OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Tim Henman kept the hopes of the British
brotherhood alive and well Monday by reaching the quarterfinal
round at Wimbledon for the third consecutive year with a smooth
upset of sixth-seeded Patrick Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   But sisterhood turned solitary when Serena Williams succumbed to
a leg injury and left it to the seventh-seeded Venus to forge ahead
alone.
</P>
<P>
   She called it ``those slipping blues at Wimbledon,'' but the
16-year-old Serena Williams was not singing a torch song. She was
making her excuse for bailing out against Virginia Ruano Pascual of
Spain after the rain-slicked lawn of Court 13 behaved more like a
banana peel.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Williams sister, whose Wimbledon debut was supposed
to feature a much ballyhooed Round of 16 confrontation with her
18-year-old sister, strained her left calf muscle midway through
the first set of what turned out to be a 7-5, 4-1 victory for the
astonished Spaniard.
</P>
<P>
   Though Williams later admitted she could have completed the
match, she opted to default just after improving a 4-0 second-set
deficit by holding serve. And then, instead of plopping herself and
her bandaged leg in her changeover chair, she sauntered over to the
umpire and announced that she was through for the day.
</P>
<P>
   The 47th-ranked Ruano Pascual did not realize what had
transpired until the crowd began to clap and drift away. At that
point she stood up, gave a sheepish shrug and raised her arms to
celebrate a strange victory that sent her into a Round of 16 date
with the other Williams sister.
</P>
<P>
   Ruano Pascual later said it was the first time she had won _ or
lost _ a match in which her opponent failed to shake her hand in
acknowledgment. Williams said the oversight was not intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, I forgot,'' she said. ``I never had to quit during a
match before.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the 24-year-old Ruano Pascual, who converted four of five
break opportunities and racked up winners on 19 of her 22 forays to
the net, was obviously more of an all-court player than Williams
anticipated, the teen-ager denied that she was outplayed or
outclassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``She played pretty good today, but if I was in better shape, it
wouldn't have been happening at all,'' Williams said. ``I could
have carried on if I wanted to, but I have to think about the
future. In the future I definitely see myself as one of the
champions. I don't want to hurt myself over something silly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to be pretty excited about facing each other
again,'' she said of facing her older sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to give something exciting to England for once,''
she said jokingly, apparently unaware that between Henman's 6-3,
6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 6-2 triumph against Rafter, the U.S. Open champion,
and the British soccer team's second-round stand just across the
English Channel in the World Cup, that the home nation has all the
excitement it can stand.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Serena Williams, whose future is ahead of her,
third-seeded Petr Korda, who finally won a Grand Slam title this
year at the Australian Open, is 30 and less assured of his
tomorrows. That is why Korda soldiered on Monday evening despite
taking a slip on Court 2 that caused him to sprain his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Leading John Van Lottum of the Netherlands, 6-3, 6-4, 5-5, when
he fell and did an inadvertent rendition of the splits, Korda had
the offending ankle taped up and hung on for a 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4)
victory that sent him into the quarterfinals against the
12th-seeded Henman.
</P>
<P>
   It took Pete Sampras, the defending champion, three days and
four rain delays to do it, but he arrived in the fourth round with
a 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-3) ouster of Thomas Enqvist of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who began the match with six consecutive aces on
Saturday afternoon and wound up with 29, said this year's grim
weather has put everybody ``on an emotional roller coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras figures to encounter minimal resistance from his
next opponent, Sebastien Grosjean, a 117th-ranked French qualifier
who reached the Round of 16 by ignoring the near three-hour rain
delay that interrupted play in the third set of his 6-0, 7-6
(10-8), 6-2 upset of 16th-seeded Felix Mantilla of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Venus Williams advanced to the fourth round without complication
by overpowering Chanda Rubin, 6-3, 6-4, and said she is convinced
she can win this Slam, particularly with Serena out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serena is definitely the toughest player out there,'' Venus
Williams said. ``She didn't lose. She retired. I have to go on and
just make sure I do what Serena didn't do today. I'm definitely at
the point where I can do this now.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ Goran Ivanisevic, seeded 14th and convinced his career is on
the mend, used 44 aces to overwhelm Daniel Vacek, 6-7 (6-8), 7-6
(7-4), 6-3, 6-4. ``If I keep my mind and play like this, I can beat
anybody here,'' said the Croat, a two-time finalist, who next plays
Todd Martin, a two-time semifinalist.
</P>
<P>
   _ There were no surprises among the top-seeded women who
performed Monday. Second-seeded Lindsay Davenport reached the
quarterfinal opposite 16th-seeded Nathalie Tauziat with a 6-1, 6-0
demolition of Spain's Magui Serna, and sixth-seeded Monica Seles
earned a quarterfinal clash with unseeded Natasha Zvereva by
dispatching last year's Wimbledon nemesis, 14th-seeded Sandrine
Testud, 6-3, 6-2. &QL;

NBA TO BEGIN LOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Includes issues sidebar)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The NBA will close down at midnight Tuesday night and not
re-open for business until its labor problem is resolved,
Commissioner David Stern announced Monday. The lockout, the second
in three years, could extend into next season, the commissioner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that is fair and accurate,'' Stern said of possibly
losing games to a work stoppage for the first time in NBA history.
``There are a number of clubs that will do better not operating
than operating. That's something the players don't seem to
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Billy Hunter, the executive director of the NBA
Players Association: ``Until the owners abandon their posture of
one-sided concession bargaining, and show some willingness to
compromise, it is difficult to expect any progress. The owners
continue to demand unprecedented concessions.''
</P>
<P>
   The lockout was agreed upon after a conference call of owners.
Stern said that while there was no formal vote, the league's Labor
Relations Committee had voted unanimously to impose a lockout. The
current Collective Bargaining Agreement expires at midnight
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the provisions of the lockout, the players will not be
paid, nor will they be allowed to have any ``basketball'' contact
with management. Team facilities will be closed, negotiations and
trades are not permitted, and any summer exhibitions or camps are
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The league did say it would allow previously scheduled charity
games to go forward and would not object if a member of a team's
medical staff met with a player with a rehabilitative need to
monitor recovery. The meeting would have to be somewhere other than
the team's training facility, however. Teams also will forward a
player's mail and the league won't prevent players and management
from co-mingling in social situations, such as weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Stern and deputy commissioner Russ Granik outlined the basic
problem, which has not changed since the league voted 27-2 in March
to re-open the current Collective Bargaining Agreement. In the
agreement, the owners agreed to pay 48 percent of all basketball
revenues to the players and felt that they could live with 51.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   This past year, Stern said the league paid out more than 57
percent to the players. Thus, even though the league is generating
record revenues, more than the agreed-upon amount is going to the
players. Granik said the league as a whole will lose money this
season for the first time in 15 years while profits have been
steadily decreasing since peaking at around 20 percent in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to continue to play next season under the
current conditions,'' Stern said. ``It's the system that doesn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter said, ``The owners' demands are especially unreasonable
in light of the continued acknowledgment by the commissioner that
the league continues to generate healthy and increasing revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1 there have been nine negotiating sessions, most of
them of three to five hours, Granik said. The last session last
week, however, took only 30 minutes. Granik said the league has
made four different proposals, all of which he said guarantee that
salaries continue to rise, but at a slower rate. The union, he
said, made one proposal on April 1 and remains adamant that it will
not give up the Larry Bird exception, a provision which allows
teams to exceed the salary cap to sign their own players.
</P>
<P>
   According to an agent familiar with the negotiations, the
league's proposals were ``rigid, hard-line and extreme.'' The
agent, who asked not to be identified, equated the league proposals
with someone trying to buy your house for well below market value.
``You don't even bother to make a counter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The average NBA salary is around $2.6 million and roughly 55
percent of the players make $1 million or more, Stern said.
However, the league insists more than half of its teams lost money
last season; the union says their auditors found four teams in the
red. Teams will receive television money regardless _ it will be
repaid if there are no games, but NBC doesn't start an active
schedule until after Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money has to be repaid to the network,'' Stern said. ``It
was arranged that in the event of a work stoppage, teams will be
able to survive the season without suffering dire economic
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be the third lockout in league history. A lockout in
the summer of 1995 lasted well into September and produced the
current collective bargaining Agreement, which was for six years.
However, the agreement contained a re-opener clause for the owners
after three years. The other lockout came in 1996 and lasted only a
couple hours and was due to disputes over modifications to the
agreement from the year before.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout already caused USA Basketball to remove the 12 NBA
players from its roster for this summer's world championships in
Athens. The players had decided that participating would, in
effect, be akin to marketing the NBA. Instead, USA Basketball will
field a team likely composed of collegians and, possibly, Americans
playing professionally overseas.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE ISSUES IN THE LOCKOUT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We should just put a large dollar sign here because _ surprise _
that's what's at the heart of the latest NBA lockout. The league
wants to salaries to rise, but not as fast as they are rising. The
union wants the stars to continue to get theirs while also getting
better deals for the lower-paid players.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Larry Bird Exception: This is the big issue. It allows
teams to re-sign their own veteran free agents to any salary. There
are some exceptions to the exception, but it applies to most
everyone. The original concept was sound; it allowed teams to keep
their own players. But lately it has been used by teams to re-sign
players to exorbitant deals, the latest being Kevin Garnett's
six-year, $126 million deal. The NBA wants to either eliminate the
Bird exception altogether or modify it. The union wants it to stay
the way it is and says it won't budge on that.
</P>
<P>
   -- Rookies: All first round draft picks the last three years
have signed three-year guaranteed deals. The league wants to move
that back to four or five year deals. In addition, rookie wage
scale players can extend their contract by any amount (see Garnett)
after just the second year and, if they don't, become free agents
after their third year. The league wants to make the rookies
restricted free agents after the first contract expires, giving
teams the right to match any offer.
</P>
<P>
   -- Salary Cap: It's part of the fabric now. The league would
love to institute a hard cap, such as football has, which would
prevent teams from spending wildly. The players don't like any cap,
including the one that's already in place which is a soft cap.

MORE GAYS IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVING UNPROTECTED SEX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ A 50 percent increase of high-risk sex among gay men in
San Francisco has surprised and puzzled AIDS experts there, because
it has so far not shown up in higher rates of human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.
</P>
<P>
   Half of San Francisco gays who are 29 to 35 years old _ the
``second generation'' of the epidemic in a city among the hardest
hit by AIDS _ are engaging in unprotected anal intercourse,
according to a study being presented here today at the 12th World
AIDS Conference.
</P>
<P>
   The new trend is all the more striking because San Francisco's
gay community has often been cited as a model of responsible
behavior change and resulting drop in HIV transmission. Although
some studies in the early 1990s documented an upturn in risky
behaviors among younger gay males, the new data show a much higher
surge within the wider community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scary that so many men in a city with such high HIV rates
are taking these risks,'' said Maria Ekstrand of the University of
California at San Francisco. ``It's riskier than Russian
roulette.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently between 30 and 40 percent of San Francisco gay men are
HIV-positive, down from about 50 percent in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Ekstrand said she and her colleagues were stunned to discover
that the proportion of gay men 29 to 35 years old reporting
unprotected anal sex went up 50 percent from 1992 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The men were in a study of 510 gay and bisexual San Franciscans
randomly selected from the 21 census tracts in the city most
affected by AIDS. The group has been followed since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Data since 1996 show the tendency toward risky sex has
continued. A separate analysis from the same group which considers
only men who were uninfected at the beginning of each year, found
that 14 percent were engaging in unprotected receptive anal
intercourse in 1993-94, but 26 percent reported this riskiest of
behaviors this year.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, however, the rate of new HIV infections within
the study group has not been rising _ and it appears to have fallen
recently, from 1.3 percent in 1995-96 to 0.9 percent in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers can only speculate about why riskier behaviors
have not yet translated into higher infection rates.
</P>
<P>
   One reason, said Dennis Osmond of the research group, may be
that HIV-infected men who are taking potent antiviral therapy may
be less likely to infect others because there is less virus in
their blood and seminal fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible explanation, Osmond said, is that gay men are
reportedly asking prospective sexual partners if they are
HIV-positive before deciding what kind of risks to take, a practice
known as ``negotiated safety.'' However, the study shows nearly
half of those who engaged in unprotected sex did not know their
partner's HIV status.

SPORTS COLUMN: DAVID CONE'S LITTLE WAR WITH HIMSELF  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The conflict within the game matches a career-long
personal tenet against a newly embraced view of medical fact.
Halfway to 20 victories before the season is mathematically half
over, David Cone also finds himself in the middle of a juggling
act, trying to strike a proper balance between cockiness and
caution, emotion and ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The unfortunate truth of the matter is, some days that is easier
said than done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I feel like the best is still ahead of me,'' Cone
said recently. ``And then I shake myself into reality and say,
`Just take what you can get.' ''
</P>
<P>
   So many games, so much temptation, and the playoffs do seem so
far away. But the memory of his dead arm contributing to the
Yankees' playoff demise last season lingers far more than his right
shoulder's dull throb.
</P>
<P>
   Cone pitches to get back to the postseason, a place he believes
he evicted himself from last time around by ``failing to make the
distinction between pain and injury.'' By letting the tough guy in
him decide he could ``pitch through anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The riddle for Cone these days is to not get blinded by his own
success, swayed by his own inner strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Cone is an innings guy, and he knows no one can have a
big year without pitching through some pain,'' said his pitching
coach, Mel Stottlemyre. ``But those innings take a toll. He has to
recognize when to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   If he were given a choice of selecting from a menu of
opportunity, of course, Cone would take a couple more electric
autumn nights at Yankee Stadium over beating the likes of the
Philadelphia Phillies Tuesday night in the Bronx. What he wouldn't
have given to have his turn come up against the Mets. He has Jordan
in him, Cone does. The bigger the game, the hungrier he is for the
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of athletes are really fearful of failure,'' he
said. ``I used to have some fear, but now, the only thing I fear is
a missed opportunity, not pitching in a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   He also happens to be a 35-year-old pitcher who has taken
surgical shoulder hits in consecutive years. He knows that
Stottlemyre is right, that physiology is not dictated by
psychology, and that when his body speaks now, he had better
listen. Then again, when the messages are mixed just what is he
supposed to think?
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, he was pitching to an earned run average
over 6.00, and began to think he would never again be more than a
five- or six-inning pitcher again. He said he was ``starting to
feel old.''
</P>
<P>
   This was in the visitors' clubhouse at Shea Stadium last
Saturday morning, and from the locker stall next door, Darryl
Strawberry chimed in. ``You're still old,'' he said. ``We're both
old.''
</P>
<P>
   Except this season has suddenly become something of a romp
through a Disney cartoon. Since his slow start, Cone has
dramatically improved his pitch-per-inning count while lasting
deeper into the game. His walk-strikeout ratio is actually better
now than ever. He recently dominated Cleveland's and Atlanta's
imposing lineups. The way the Yankees produce runs, make few
defensive mistakes and close out games, Cone, at 10-2, has a chance
to win 20. The last time he did that was also the first time, a
decade ago with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he is to pitching what George Steinbrenner is to owning, and
none of this regular-season prosperity would matter if this season
ends like last season, with the mound feeling like the Boston
Marathon's Heartbreak Hill. He left a game one day against Texas
because he couldn't get the ball to home plate. Cone forced himself
back too soon, and later talked his way into Manager Joe Torre's
heart and Game 1 against Cleveland, another mistake. By early
winter, doctors had surgically cleaned out his shoulder, and he was
embracing rationalizations of the end.
</P>
<P>
   He told himself he was lucky, ahead of the game, that his arm
had given him more pitches than anyone except maybe Randy Johnson
these last 10 years. This was all pre-emptive, premature. He was
back in the rotation before Torre and Stottlemyre expected him. Now
Cone and Strawberry, who already have World Series rings from 1996,
have quiet talks about what a joy it to be granted renewed baseball
life on a team as good as this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch in a pennant race, get a post-season start, that's the
ultimate,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no race, really, but there is the long season to
survive. Cone said he has always ``pushed the limit,'' but now he
knows there has to be a time to walk away, off the mound. Live to
pitch another October.

ADVERTISING: J. WALTER THOMPSON AGENCY WINS MERRILL LYNCH ACCOUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Merrill Lynch is bullish on J. Walter Thompson New
York, an agency that has suffered a spate of bearish news in the
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. has ended one of the most closely watched
recent reviews by selecting the flagship New York office of the J.
Walter Thompson Co., a unit of WPP Group PLC, to handle its
worldwide account, with estimated billings of $85 million. Thompson
New York will serve as the lead office on the account, involving
Merrill Lynch operations in 45 countries.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, made Monday, was a delight and a relief for
Thompson New York after a period of tumult that included account
losses, executive reshufflings and shortfalls in other high-profile
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here is very thrilled,'' said Bob Jeffrey, who joined
Thompson New York as president on March 31 and attended his first
account pitch meeting two days later. ``It's a big win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill Lynch account had been handled for 12 years by
Bozell Worldwide in New York, a unit of True North Communications,
which resigned rather than take part in the review as it began in
February. The decision came after the review had been narrowed to
Thompson and one other finalist, D'Arcy Masius Benton &AMP; Bowles
Communications in New York, a unit of MacManus Group.
</P>
<P>
   The shift by Merrill Lynch is emblematic of the ferment in the
financial services field as a growing number of marketers rethink
agency relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, for instance, Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. consolidated
its brand advertising, with billings estimated at $50 million, at
the BBDO New York unit of Omnicom Group, while the Dreyfus Corp.,
part of the Mellon Bank Corp., narrowed a review on its account,
with estimated billings of $30 million, to six contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition is intensifying with a lot more entrants into
the financial services world,'' said Paul W. Critchlow, senior vice
president for marketing and communications at Merrill Lynch in New
York, ``so we thought it was timely to begin differentiating the
Merrill Lynch brand and put some additional advertising resources
against our businesses, in the United States and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``A third of our revenue comes from outside the U.S.,'' he
added, ``and that's growing rapidly'' because of ventures like
Merrill Lynch Japan Securities Ltd., a private-client operation
being opened in that country tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Both Thompson and DMB&AMP;B strove mightily to land Merrill Lynch as
a client, partly because of the prestige associated with the firm
and partly because of the cachet Wall Street has as the stock
market trades in near-record territory. Martin Sorrell, chief
executive at WPP in London, and Roy J. Bostock, chairman and chief
executive at MacManus in New York, both took active roles in their
agencies' pitches.
</P>
<P>
   And both agencies were hoping that winning the review would
offset some recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil at Thompson New York included the abrupt departure
of Jeffrey's predecessor, Susan Giannino; the loss of a longtime
client, the Eastman Kodak Co., to a sibling WPP agency, Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather Worldwide in New York, and failure in reviews for
assignments from marketers like the First Brands Corp. and the
Pepsi-Cola Co. unit of Pepsico Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``This weekend was the first I've had off in two months,'' said
Jeffrey, who came to Thompson New York from Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS,
part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies,
where he had been president and managing director of the San
Francisco office.
</P>
<P>
   And DMB&AMP;B had been hoping to help compensate for the loss in
late March of a top client, the Gateway computer company, after
handling its worldwide account for only a year. The account, with
billings estimated at $50 million to $70 million, had been one of
the 10 largest at DMB&AMP;B; the agency is now suing Gateway for $9
million in connection with the dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Haney, a spokesman for DMB&AMP;B in Troy, Mich., said that the
agency was ``very disappointed'' at the Merrill Lynch decision.
</P>
<P>
   The decision had been expected around June 1, but that week
executives at Merrill Lynch asked both agencies to flesh out ideas
offered at what were to have been final presentations in late May.
After that, the executives split into two camps, one advocating
Thompson New York, the other DMB&AMP;B.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough choice,'' Critchlow acknowledged, ``but in
the end we felt Thompson really was better suited to help build our
brand on a global basis.'' The initial campaign from Thompson New
York will be based on the agency's previously submitted ideas, he
said, after they are ``refined and adjusted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's premature to say what form the ads will take since we
have some more work to do,'' Critchlow said, ``but it will be
different from what we currently have.'' The present Merrill Lynch
campaign carries the theme ``The difference is Merrill Lynch.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the familiar ``Bullish on America'' theme was created by
a previous agency, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, Bozell also used bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the new campaign, which will probably begin sometime in
September, will feature bulls in some form, Critchlow replied:
``The bull is our icon. The bull will never disappear; it will
always be somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The creative team at Thompson New York that worked on the
Merrill Lynch pitch was headed by Bill Hamilton, a former executive
vice president and co-creative head at the flagship New York office
of the Thompson sibling Ogilvy &AMP; Mather, who served as a
consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Bill from when we both worked at Chiat/Day together,''
Jeffrey said, ``and at Ogilvy he worked on IBM, American Express
and a lot of other blue-chip assignments.'' Merrill Lynch
executives ``saw that experience,'' he added, ``and appreciated
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton will now join Thompson New York, Jeffrey said, with
some title that would reflect his role as ``the global creative
director on Merrill Lynch.'' J.J. Jordan is the executive vice
president and executive creative director at Thompson New York.
</P>
<P>
   The Merrill Lynch review started with five agencies. The others
were: Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding in New York, which is also owned by
True North; Grey Advertising in New York, and the New York office
of Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS. Foote, Cone and Grey were eliminated in
April and Lowe was eliminated in mid-May.

HIGH-TECH WAYS TO GET TRAFFIC DATA TO PHOENIX MOTORISTS UNVEILED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY JO PITZL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The route out of traffic tie-ups may be through your
cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Or your computer.
</P>
<P>
   Or your TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, members of a high-tech consortium unveiled the many
ways they've devised for Phoenix-area motorists to get traffic
information before driving into a traffic jam.
</P>
<P>
   The most advanced method _ and the most costly _ is the
``Traffic Angel,'' which dials a motorist's cell phone whenever
something happens to slow traffic on the commuter's usual route.
The service will be available to Phoenix-area residents by fall.
</P>
<P>
   A special television traffic channel already is available to
Tempe cable users. And an Internet service provides
up-to-the-minute traffic conditions on freeways and streets
throughout the Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time after time, people tell us transportation is the No. 1
problem and the No. 1 concern in our community,'' explained Tempe
Mayor Neil Giuiliano.
</P>
<P>
   Feeding traffic information through technology developed by the
AZTech consortium may help put an end to transportation
frustrations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it won't put the radio traffic reports out of business. Some
of the information provided through the new television, Internet
and phone service comes from Metro Networks, the largest
traffic-reporting system in the nation. &UR; Other data is gathered from
the Arizona Department of Transportation's freeway network, as well
as traffic information from cities and Maricopa County.
</P>
<P>
   The services showcased Monday are the latest wrinkles in
Arizona's move toward intelligent-transportation systems. Fueled by
a $7.5 million federal grant, metropolitan Phoenix is one of four
regions in the United States experimenting with ways to use
technology to move traffic faster and more safely. The technology
is seen as a less-expensive alternative to expanding freeways or
building new ones.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix will be one of 10 cities where the cell-phone service
will be launched in September, said Craig Lynar, a vice president
at Etak, one of the private companies working with officials of
ADOT, Maricopa County and Phoenix-area cities as members of the
AzTech consortium. The California-based Etak, a subsidiary of Sony
Corp., publishes digital maps.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to feed traffic information through an AT&AMP;T
PocketNet cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists can use the display screen on the phone to read
current traffic information, Lynar said. &UR; Or they can take it
several steps further and have the ``Traffic Angel'' call them with
details of traffic jams that would affect their commutes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for a monthly fee, subscribers would enter their
driving routes, such as from home to office or to school, and then
specify what times they plan to use the routes. If the service
detects a problem at those times, Traffic Angel calls the driver's
cell phone. The information would pop up on the phone's display
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The service will be available only through AT&AMP;T's PocketNet
phone. The phone is specially equipped to receive data similar to a
miniature computer browser, Lynar said. The service costs $29 a
month; an additional $5 fee would buy the notification service.
</P>
<P>
   As for the television and Internet services, officials said they
hope motorists would tap into those before leaving home or work.
Armed with up-to-date information, they could adjust their
commutes &UR; for the fastest paths to their destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The television information is only available to Tempe cable
users. Other Phoenix-area cities want to see how the service works
out before committing time on their own cable stations, Giuiliano
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tempe also will use the service to post traffic information for
special events, such as football games. &QL;

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Standing in the middle of the first floor of Saks
Fifth Avenue in Manhattan is a little like arriving in Tangier on
the ferry from Spain. Peddlers with exotic wares are everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies, new fall colors,'' beckons a woman from Estee Lauder,
running her hands over a display case of violet-toned shadows and
blushes. ``Need some help?'' asks a woman from the Stila counter
over the head of the customer whose makeup she is applying. ``Try
Bulgari,'' announces an immaculately groomed saleswoman, gripping a
bottle of perfume, poised to spray.
</P>
<P>
   This is the way expensive makeup has been sold in this country
for decades, with cosmetics company representatives sitting at
counters or wandering the aisles throughout department stores,
hoping to ensnare women looking for a new eye shadow and getting
them to buy a nail polish or astringent to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   But a French luxury cosmetics emporium is coming to town,
betting that women will be willing to try an entirely different
experience. In this store, perfumes will be arranged in
alphabetical order, with nary a sprayer in sight.
</P>
<P>
   While some products will be displayed by brand, often a mix of
lines will be placed together by product classification _ say, a
shelf of mud masks or a rack of anti-aging creams.
</P>
<P>
   The salespeople will work for the store owner itself _ Sephora,
a unit of LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton _ and not the cosmetics
companies. Of course, if anyone asks, they will be happy to make
strong recommendations, and large advertising displays will be
omnipresent.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be none of the gift-with-purchase deals _ the
bottle of perfume, the box of scented powder and the odd teddy bear
that come free with a $59 purchase _ that are the backbone of
cosmetics retailing.
</P>
<P>
   Sephora's new 9,000-square-foot store _ opening next month on
Broadway in SoHo _ will join other independent stores like Make-Up
Forever, Aveda and Origins, a unit of Estee Lauder, that are also
trying to grab new business outside traditional industry formats.
</P>
<P>
   But those upstart chains of smaller stores sell only their own
wares. No retailer is making as big a bet as Sephora, which was
purchased last July by LVMH, a luxury holding company that also
sells Champagne and other high-end goods. With 11,000 products for
sale, Sephora is a sort of luxury cosmetics general store, and SoHo
is just its port of entry into America.
</P>
<P>
   The company is negotiating to acquire a site in Rockefeller
Center. About 15 other stores are scheduled to open this year
throughout the United States, in such cities as Los Angeles, Miami,
San Francisco and Seattle. And smaller versions will appear in
upscale American malls soon after, Sephora executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The company already runs 54 stores in France, with a
14,000-square-foot flagship on the Champs-Elysees in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Sephora's arrival in the United States will be closely watched
by competitors, as the retailer pushes up against several
presumptions that have long dominated the industry. Will women buy
as many products if they are not heavily pushed by sales clerks?
Will customers appreciate the freedom to wander and try things out
at whim?
</P>
<P>
   ``We find that 40 percent of mall visitors don't go into
department stores,'' said Howard Meitiner, chief executive of
Sephora. ``That means there is a huge audience out there looking
for new outlets for beauty shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   But will small makeup companies that have developed strong,
exclusive relationships with certain department stores jeopardize
that by jumping on board with Sephora?
</P>
<P>
   And will large suppliers be satisfied with being sold like
cereal on an alphabetically arranged shelf? Cosmetics companies
have considerable teeth: their products often account for more than
10 percent of a department store's total revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most vendors realize we are making the market bigger,'' said
Myron E. Ullman III, chief executive of the DFS Group, the LVMH
subsidiary that operates Sephora, and a former chief executive of
Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   The cosmetics industry has several top players that own most of
the market and are widely distributed, with dozens of little
companies trying to make a go in fewer venues. Sales of cosmetics
and perfume reached $14.5 billion in the United States last year,
with about one-third of the sales in department stores, said Allan
Mottus, editor of The Informationist, a trade publication for the
beauty industry.
</P>
<P>
   Another third came through drugstores, with the rest split among
mass merchants and various other outlets, including Cosmetics Plus,
a chain of off-price beauty products in New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Of the roughly 2,300 department stores that carry prestige
cosmetics, almost all carry Estee Lauder, Clinique, Lancome and
Elizabeth Arden. By comparison, smaller lines like Bobbi Brown, MAC
and Christian Dior are found in about 700 stores, and in a few of
their own small shops.
</P>
<P>
   Sephora, while focusing on many of the brands offered in upscale
stores, also carries some lines found in drugstores, like Nivea. It
sells its own private label line, too, which includes 365 shades of
lip color. Customers can freely test samples, and the sales help,
dressed in black Nehru suits, are supposed to know something about
all the products.
</P>
<P>
   Have dry skin and don't want to chat about it? Simply pop a
description of the problem into a computer and it will recommend a
variety of products from different companies, instead of, say, an
entire skin care line by Chanel.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a display that breaks down scents to their key
ingredients, so if a shopper is in love with lavender, she can find
out which perfumes are infused with it.
</P>
<P>
   American retailers are taking note. Bloomingdale's, a unit of
Federated Department Stores Inc., sent a team to explore the
Champs-Elysees Sephora store last year and has been furiously
remodeling its flagship's first floor, all the while maintaining
that the changes have nothing to do with Sephora. Nonetheless, it
is freshening the floor's look, adding more interactive displays
and retraining the staff _ its most extensive face lift of the area
ever.

 NEW YORK: area ever.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Department stores are obviously nervous,'' Mottus said.
``Sephora gives the consumer the opportunity to take a whole line
apart, and in Europe, some consumers like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many American consumers may, too. ``So many times you get a
makeover and it never looks the same at home,'' said Wendy Gabriel,
an accountant from Orlando, Fla., who was dodging some perfume mist
in Saks the other day. ``I'd rather experiment myself, to see if I
can really make liquid eye liner work.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sephora may find the United States a very different market
from Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, department stores play a much bigger role in the
cosmetics business in America than they do in Europe, so
competition is much tougher. Ten percent of all cosmetics purchases
in France are made in Sephora stores; no single department-store
chain in the United States can boast anywhere near such a share.
</P>
<P>
   And although many women hate having to fend off the spraying
masses of perfume pushers, they do like to see the same face at the
same makeup stand. ``I go back to the MAC counter again and again
because I know there will be that same person there to help me,''
said Stacey Wiener, head of promotions for a cable television show.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, American department stores frequently carve out
their own special deals with suppliers _ especially among
cutting-edge brands _ securing exclusive rights to a line.
</P>
<P>
   Barney's Inc., for instance, has such a hold in its New York
stores on Philosophy, a hip brand sold in little plastic containers
with black lids. It is also the only outlet for Make-Up Forever _
known for its bright palettes _ and several other lines outside
those companies' own stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are focused on keeping our distribution limited,'' said
Joyce Avelon, who runs retail operations for Philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Fifth Avenue frequently gets perfume companies to introduce
a new scent on its sales floor, with the understanding that once
the brand has been out a while its maker can start selling it
elsewhere. Often, the deals are broken down by location, with a
retailer insisting on exclusive distribution rights in, say,
Houston but not Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Department stores are not going to give up those arrangements so
easily, and will almost certainly lean on cosmetics makers _
especially small ones whose business they have more or less
created.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is reminding vendors,'' said one department store
executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``Everybody
knows the game here. Cosmetics sales per square foot are the
highest of any department in department stores, and people are very
protective of it. We are not going to stand by while another
competitor comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   The hottest lines in recent years are the signature lines
produced by makeup artists themselves, like Bobbi Brown, which
Sephora does not carry. Another is Nars, named for the makeup
artist Francois Nars, which is sold in Barneys New York, 24 Saks
stores and one Fred Segal store in Santa Monica, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like Sephora to be part of our future,'' said Kate
Sullivan, director of marketing and sales for Nars, adding,
however, that her current clients might be upset with the move.
``Most small vendors base their business on their relationships,''
she said. ``When you enter into a store when you're new, you make a
commitment to grow together.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ullman of DFS said that Sephora would have no trouble
securing the brands it wanted. ``Ultimately, if the customer
decides this is a more enjoyable way to shop,'' he said, ``vendors
will migrate to where the customer is.''
</P>
<P>
   Every major brand will be in the store _ Giorgio Armani, Chanel,
Clarins, Clinique, Calvin Klein, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Yves Saint
Laurent, L'Oreal and Versace will all be in stock. Prices will be
the same as in department stores.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason LVMH bought Sephora was to have another home
for the many cosmetic brands in its own portfolio, like Christian
Dior, Givenchy and Guerlain. Some cosmetics executives in the
United States have grumbled that they are not keen on being
displayed in a democratic fashion, and have wondered whether
Sephora's American stores will give more prominence to its parent
company's brands. Ullman says that will not happen, citing equal
treatment at the company's stores in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``DFS is run very autonomously,'' he said. ``We maintain a
Chinese wall with LVMH. Those brands will be handled no differently
than other brands. It would be foolish for us to do something that
helps 10 percent of the business at the expense of 90 percent of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, American department stores are studying the
newfangled European competitor intently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about Sephora is that it has made us stop and
think, `Are we running the business as well as we can?''' said
Michael Gould, chief executive of Bloomingdale's. ``They have made
us take a look.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unable to reach what National Basketball Association
Commissioner David Stern called ``the promised land of agreement''
with the players union on a new collective-bargaining agreement,
the NBA announced Monday it would enact a lockout of its players at
midnight today.
</P>
<P>
   League owners, who had voted 27-2 to reopen the existing
collective-bargaining agreement in March, met Monday via conference
call and decided to lock out the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The expired collective-bargaining agreement between the NBA
and its players did not work,'' said NBA Deputy Commissioner Russ
Granik. ``We have made a series of proposals to the players under
which salaries would continue to increase but at a slower rate than
under the expired deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regrettably, the players have rejected all of these proposals.
The NBA will not operate until we reach a new agreement that is
fair to both parties.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the percentage of what is called basketball-related
income (BRI) _ revenue from such things as tickets, broadcasting,
arena concessions, luxury suites, premium-seat licenses and
merchandising _ that is divided up between the players and the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   The owners reopened the collective-bargaining agreement when
player salaries climbed above 51.8 percent of the BRI. Owners, who
claim players got closer to 57 percent of the BRI, are saying that
salaries are rising faster than the league's income and that the
NBA is treading on dangerous financial ground.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did half of the NBA's 29 teams lose money, owners
insist, but the league itself did not turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   So the NBA, the only major pro sports league that has not lost a
regular-season game to work stoppage, is fully prepared to go an
entire season without playing a game.
</P>
<P>
   From promised land to potential wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our deal (the last bargaining agreement) had some risk in
it,'' Stern said. ``What we needed was an opportunity to reopen and
renegotiate if that risk turned out to be a reality. Needless to
say, 57 percent is not an economic model that works. They (the
owners) just simply wanted a deal that works.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons salaries have been climbing so quickly is the
so-called ``Larry Bird exception'' to the salary cap, which allows
teams to re-sign their own free agents for any amount, regardless
of the salary-cap figure. It was the Bird exception that allowed
the Chicago Bulls to pay Michael Jordan $33 million this season,
despite the $26.9 million-per-team salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly because of the Bird exception, 38 of the 372 NBA players
made $323.4 million _ the lion's share of the $1 billion in salary
and benefits the league doled out last year.
</P>
<P>
   The owners would like to eliminate _ or severely curtail _ the
Bird exception and install a ``hard'' salary cap, which teams could
not exceed. That would be the best way, they feel, to get salaries
under control.
</P>
<P>
   This is reportedly the biggest sticking point in the
negotiations. While other peripheral issues like the drug policy,
player conduct and expanding the rookie wage scale beyond the
current three years have been pretty much agreed upon, the Bird
exception is something the players are loath to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The union feels owners are victims of their own poor business
decisions and are now looking for the players to bail them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try not to focus on the Larry Bird exception,'' Granik
said. ``We need an agreement that is not totally open-ended, like
the current agreement. If there's a way to that, and there may (be
a way) that keeps the Larry Bird exception _ or some element of
that _ in there, then we're prepared to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we can't have a situation where we go back to the owners
again and say, `Look, we have a system that is totally open-ended.
We hope it will work a little better.' We can't do that again. It
didn't work very well.''
</P>
<P>
   So the NBA won't go to work at all.
</P>
<P>
   Starting today, players will not be paid, teams cannot trade or
negotiate with players, free agents cannot be signed, team workout
facilities will be shut down and teams cannot conduct or help with
summer camps, exhibitions, practices, workouts, coaching sessions
or team meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently unable to learn the lessons provided by Major League
Baseball, which went through a strike in 1994 and 1995 that proved
disastrous, the NBA is chancing a similar public-relations fiasco,
hoping to force the players, whose average salary is $2.2 million,
to blink first in the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't afford to play the season under the current system,''
Stern said. ``That's just a reality. Certainly the primary
beneficiaries of the current system are the players, so as an
economic matter, their risk is greater here than the owners.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because the owners have the money amassed from a $2.6
billion television contract _ a war chest that will tide them over
should the lockout spill over into the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   According to Stern, the lockout could last the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be fair and accurate (to say),'' Stern said.
``Unfortunately, there will be a number of clubs that will do
better not operating than operating. And that's something the
players don't yet understand.''

 Siebel Systems makes software that may smack of Big Brother   By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
If you have a brokerage account, if you hold shares in a mutual
fund, if you are a bank customer _ indeed, if you are anyone's
customer at all _ chances are you are being closely watched.
<TEXT>
<P>
   As computers grow exponentially faster and disk-drive capacities
approach infinity, companies are finding it easy to quickly sort
through huge customer databases. They can pull together every scrap
of information they collect and figure out the shrewdest way to
increase their sales.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel Systems of San Mateo is the leader among a half-dozen or
so companies that make software that helps companies read the
wishes of individual and corporate customers.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Siebel and its competitors, it has never been easier
for big companies to manage their sales and marketing. The
downside, privacy advocates contend, is that the information
customers provide to companies might be used for purposes of which
the customers disapprove.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel's software has a bulky name _ enterprise relationship
management application _ and a hefty price.
</P>
<P>
   Using powerful new software such as Siebel's, designed to make
the fullest use of increased computer power, companies can deftly
weave all their information about you into a tailor-made scheme to
sell you more goods or services.
</P>
<P>
   A brokerage firm, for example, can scan your portfolio, all your
buy or sell transactions and all your account deposits and
withdrawals. It can review all your requests for information and
examine all your complaints. It can stir in what it knows about
your age, income and family status.
</P>
<P>
   It may conclude that you are an affluent, fast-trading
speculator who regularly throws large new sums of money into the
market, mainly into marginal high-technology stocks. It then might
call you and offer you a chunk of its next high-tech initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel's one-time licensing fee to use the software ranges from
$1,500 to $5,000 per user, depending on how complex the customer's
needs are. At Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, the San Francisco
investment bank, 400 people use the software, which carried an
upfront fee in the neighborhood of $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most customers also pay for a service contract, which can add 15
percent to the basic cost. For this, they get a chance to meet
regularly with Siebel technicians and are entitled to free product
upgrades and debugging.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel's customers include a broad selection of large industrial
and financial companies, including Compaq Computer, Digital
Equipment, Bank of America and Prudential.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all customers require outside help to install the
software, pull fragmented data together into a single database,
test the product and mold it to their needs. Those services can
cost considerably more than the software itself.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel doesn't do much of that work itself, but rather farms it
out to Andersen Consulting, with which it has a cozy relationship.
Andersen's managing partner, George Shaheen, sits on Siebel's board
of directors, and his firm owns 8 percent of Siebel's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Siebel, the company's chairman, president, chief executive
and co-founder and a former Oracle Corp. vice president, owns 28
percent of the stock _ more than $600 million worth.
</P>
<P>
   The other co-founder, Patricia House, a former Frame Technology
executive vice president who serves as executive vice president and
chief operating officer of Siebel, has a $60 million stake in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   As expensive as Siebel's software is, the company's customers
evidently find it worth the price. Siebel, which didn't exist until
five years ago, posted operating income of $7 million on revenues
of $119 million last year, and expects revenues to triple this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery's chief executive, Thom Weisel, says Siebel software
has added $40 million to his own firm's annual revenues by helping
his investment bankers and marketing people focus more efficiently
on their best opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Montgomery people contact customers or potential
customers, they enter a record of the conversation in the database,
where it is accessible to all users.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that one of the equity bankers talked to the chief
financial officer of a software company last week,'' says Doug
Kline, a Montgomery vice president who manages technology for the
corporate finance division.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be helpful to a merger-and-acquisitions banker
trying to find a partner for one of our other customers in the
software business. Before we put the Siebel system in two years
ago, there were communications problems. To get the same kind of
information we get off the computer now, you had to call everybody
in the department.''
</P>
<P>
   Some privacy advocates say enterprise software has a Big
Brotherish tinge.
</P>
<P>
   Even though companies may be drawing strictly from data they
gathered legitimately, and are using it for internal purposes only,
they have no automatic right to use it for high-pressure sales,
says Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of Privacy Journal in
Providence, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information gathered for one purpose should not be used for an
incompatible purpose without the consent of the individual,'' Smith
remarks. ``Up front you have a responsibility to tell your customer
what you plan to do with the information you get from him.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Siebel customers are reluctant to say exactly how they use
the company's products.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco discount broker Charles Schwab &AMP; Co. tried to
avoid the question at first. Eventually Schwab spokesman Tom
Taggart disclosed that employees use the Siebel system in part to
determine which customers requested Individual Retirement Account
applications but never sent them back. Schwab employees then place
follow-up calls.
</P>
<P>
   A Schwab competitor, Boston-based Fidelity Investments, also
uses Siebel software. It declined to discuss the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Seibel stock, which trades on Nasdaq, closed at a record high of
$32.19 yesterday, up $2.06 for the day.

 LSI Logic To Acquire Hyundai's Symbios   By Amy Doan  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Chipmaker LSI Logic Corp. said yesterday it will acquire Symbios
Inc., a Hyundai Electronics America unit that makes high-end data
storage and adapter cards, for $760 million in cash.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This gives us an `instant on' in the storage market that we
couldn't get through licensing,'' said Bruce Entin, vice president
of Milpitas-based LSI.
</P>
<P>
   One analyst said the acquisition is a natural evolution for LSI.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little overlap in the product lines of the two
companies,'' said Nimal Vallipuram, managing director of Bear
Stearns &AMP; Co. Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives LSI a broader base of intellectual property.''
</P>
<P>
   LSI is known for its chips for networking equipment and for
``system-on-a-chip'' technology, which combines multiple computing
functions onto a single chip.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Symbios will help LSI penetrate higher-end
computing markets by integrating Symbios' storage features with its
existing line of chips, analysts and LSI said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most analysts viewed the purchase as a shrewd way for
LSI to tap into the fast-growing storage market, one said that LSI
was ``paying too much'' for Symbios.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the short term, it's an expensive move,'' said Robert
Chaplinsky of Hambrecht &AMP; Quist in San Francisco. ``They're paying
greater than 1.2 times Symbios' 1997 sales.''
</P>
<P>
   But LSI's Entin called the $760 million purchase price ``quite a
bargain in today's market.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes just days after Adaptec Inc. of Milpitas, which
also develops storage technology, halted its planned acquisition of
Symbios over concerns that the U.S. Federal Trade Commission would
block the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Adaptec on Friday said it believed the FTC would object to
perceived monopolies in certain markets. Together, Adaptec and
Symbios control 80 percent of the market for high-end data storage
products, according to Hambrecht &AMP; Quist LLC.
</P>
<P>
   Both Adaptec and Symbios offer technology that lets computer
servers communicate with other systems on the network like scanners
and printers.
</P>
<P>
   LSI had been talking with Symbios during the same six-month
period Adaptec was courting it, according to LSI's Entin.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from LSI and Symbios met Saturday afternoon after the
Adaptec deal was scuttled and agreed to the acquisition, he said.
</P>
<P>
   LSI will take an undisclosed charge in 1998 for the purchase,
and will assume Symbios' liabilities. LSI had revenues of $1.29
billion in 1997 and Symbios had sales of $620 million.
</P>
<P>
   LSI has 4,400 employees, 2,100 of whom are in the Bay Area.
Symbios, based in Fort Collins, Colo., has 2,400 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition should be complete, pending regulatory approval,
by September 30, the end of LSI's third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at LSI said they do not expect any layoffs at either
company. Symbios will be operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of
LSI.
</P>
<P>
   LSI closed up 19 cents at $23.31.

 2 Bay Area `Push' Firms Shoved Aside   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Rule 101 of Internet start-ups: The window of opportunity to cash
out for big bucks is open only briefly before it abruptly shuts.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Take the cautionary examples of PointCast and Marimba, a pair of
Bay Area companies that pioneered technology to broadcast, or
``push,'' customized information to computer screens over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, both were anointed the Next Big Things on the Net.
Marimba's photogenic chief executive, Kim Polese, radiated from the
cover of major high-tech publications and &UR;  &LR; Time magazine named her
one of the 25 most influential people in America. And executives at
PointCast _ which was being touted as an overnight success story _
spurned a $400 million buyout bid from media mogul Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the push companies have been shoved aside. Yahoo and
Excite _ whose Web-search sites have been made over into ``portal''
sites that combine free e-mail, message boards, news and shopping _
are all the rage on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Sunnyvale-based PointCast reportedly is seeking a buyer, even
though it filed last month to go public in July. The company hopes
to sell 4.3 million shares of stock for about $10 to $12 a share.
At $11 a share, PointCast would be worth $235 million _ about half
of the Murdoch offer.
</P>
<P>
   Marimba hardly made a peep for months until it announced a major
software upgrade last week. The Mountain View company _ which is
backed by the powerful Menlo Park venture capital firm of Kleiner
Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers _ still has plans to go public, possibly
in 1999, but sources say it too is on the block.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Marimba's VCs) saw any exit, I can't believe they wouldn't
have taken it by now,'' said David Simons, managing director of
Digital Video Investments in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of PointCast and Marimba highlights the fickle nature
of the Internet market, which has careened from one concept du jour
to another, industry observers said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``The Internet is full of fads, and I think push was the
biggest of them,'' said Jim Clark, chairman and co-founder of
Mountain View-based Netscape Communications, the mother of all
Internet start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sun shines brightly on a select place for a concerted
moment and then it passes. If you don't cash in, you're f_,'' said
Michael Wolff, author of ``Burn Rate: How I Survived the Gold Rush
Years on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in this market is timing, timing, timing,'' Wolff
said. ``It's all about promise, hype and heat _ not about business
performance. PointCast and Marimba's time came and went.''
</P>
<P>
   The time apparently is now for companies with portal sites. In
the past month, Walt Disney Co. has bought 44 percent of Infoseek,
NBC made substantial investments in Cnet, and AOL shunned a $30
billion takeover offer from AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But Marimba CEO Kim Polese vehemently disputes the notion that
Marimba is passe. In fact, she claims the company is at the center
of ``the next great wave on the Internet _ distributed enterprise
applications.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been quietly kicking serious butt,'' said Polese in
discussing the company's new software program, Castanet 3.0, and
its expanding customer list, which now totals 800 _ including
Federal Express, Ford Motor and Intuit.
</P>
<P>
   Castanet 3.0 lets corporations ship software programs and
upgrades over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Marimba has nearly doubled its workforce over the past year, to
130.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to do a pile-on or an IPO rush,'' Polese said.
``It's not about an immediate payoff, but about building a
substantive company that will be consistently profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Polese admits Marimba ``could have done a better job defining
what we do.'' Because it didn't, she said, ``we were lumped into
the push category. We've always been much more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   While Marimba's problems are over its identity, PointCast's stem
from stiff competition.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Netscape's Communicator
Web browsers offer free ``push'' features. And PointCast has lost
subscribers amid complaints that the service was delivering too
much unwanted content and slowing down internal corporate networks.
</P>
<P>
   PointCast CEO David Dorman has said the company is making a
transition from strictly broadcasting news to consumers. PointCast
wants to become the de facto information conduit for employees at
Fortune 500 companies, delivering companywide messages, sales
updates, employee news and a calendar of corporate events, as well
as traditional news.
</P>
<P>
   PointCast officials, who are in the midst of a legally mandated
quiet period before the company goes public, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, PointCast's and Marimba's overheated hype machines
and willingness to talk may have led to their current predicaments.
</P>
<P>
   One Silicon Valley venture capitalist said, ``These guys
trumpeted themselves loudly, but didn't do a good job of explaining
who they were. They set themselves up for a fall.''

LSI TO BUY CHIP SUBSIDIARY FROM HYUNDAI ELECTRONICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ LSI Logic Corp. said Monday that it had agreed
to acquire Symbios Inc., a Silicon Valley-based subsidiary of
Hyundai Electronics America, for about $760 million in cash,
including assumption of debt.
</P>
<P>
   Symbios, which had 1997 sales of $620 million, is a leader in
Small Computer System Interface, known as SCSI and pronounced
scuzzy, chips used to connect to networks and peripheral devices,
like disk and tape drives.
</P>
<P>
   LSI, which is based in Milpitas, Calif., is best known for its
system-on-a-chip technology, used in products like Sony's
Playstation video game player, but has also been a participant in
the market for disk-drive controllers.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes four days after Hyundai, a unit of
Hyundai Motor Co., and Adaptec Inc., the leading producer of SCSI
devices, ended an earlier accord in which Adaptec planned to buy
Symbios for $775 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Adaptec said it had learned that the Federal Trade Commission
was unlikely to approve that merger because of the combined
companies' apparent domination of the SCSI market. &QL;

 Love Him Or Hate Him _ King of the Business Press Release   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
If business news gushes out of corporate America with fire-hose
intensity, then Lorry Lokey is the guy directing the nozzle.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lokey, 71, is founder and president of Business Wire, the San
Francisco firm that disseminates about half of all the business
press releases in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, 15,000 pieces of corporate propaganda on everything
from products to mergers pour into Business Wire's offices. The
firm's 335-person staff pumps these releases into thousands of
national and international media outlets such as newspapers,
magazines and wire services.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Companies &UR;  &LR; pay Business Wire anywhere from $65 to $1,350 to
send out a release, depending on whether the distribution is local
or global.
</P>
<P>
   Media outlets pay nothing for the information and can choose to
use it or _ more often than not _ trash it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Lokey said his privately held firm will gross $70 million this
year and now is neck and neck in market share with its only
national rival, New York-based PRNewswire.
</P>
<P>
   Lokey said his firm has a 63 percent share of the Northern
California market, which includes most high-tech news releases.
</P>
<P>
   Since founding Business Wire in 1961, Lokey has seen enormous
changes in the way business news is disseminated and received. Back
when he started, releases traveled on teletype machines, and the
business staffs at most papers were small or nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the releases travel over high-speed private electronic
networks, and the number of business journalists working at
newspapers and specialty magazines has exploded.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest boost to his business has come from the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Lokey said that when Business Wire was founded, there was no
established procedure for issuing business press releases. The
Texas Gulf Sulphur case changed that. In the mid-1960s, the
Securities and Exchange Commission prosecuted officers of the Texas
firm for buying shares in their own company  &LR; before &LR;  publicly
distributing news of a major ore discovery.
</P>
<P>
   That case established the precedent that important business news
must be widely circulated, to level the investment playing field
between insiders and the general public.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Telling all? &LR;  Authors Jennifer Edstrom and Marlin Eller blew
through San Francisco yesterday to tout their insider's book on
Microsoft, ``Barbarians Led by Bill Gates.''
</P>
<P>
   Edstrom is a freelance writer and the daughter of Pam Edstrom, a
partner in Microsoft's long-standing PR firm.
</P>
<P>
   Eller is a former lieutenant of Gates who became a millionaire
on Microsoft stock.
</P>
<P>
   Although they wrote it together, the duo disagreed on several
scores, including the conclusions one could draw from the book.
</P>
<P>
   To Edstrom, Microsoft emerged as a ``predatory'' firm that
should be reigned in by antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Although Eller left the company in 1995 (he now runs
Seattle-based Sunhawk Corp., which publishes sheet music on the
Internet), he defended Microsoft, which he joined in 1982 as
employee 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, we're going out to eat the grass and, yes, we want to
eat all the grass, and if some of the other grass-eaters die, that
doesn't make us a predator,'' Eller said.
</P>
<P>
   The authors even disagree on Edstrom's motivation for writing
the book.
</P>
<P>
   Edstrom, 29, said the book was not an act of rebellion against
her super-successful mom, but a chance that any journalist would
have seized.
</P>
<P>
   Beside her, 45-year-old Eller sat shaking his head. ``Total
rebellion,'' he said, pointing at his younger collaborator.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Ramblin' man: &LR;  The digerati rocked the Fillmore last Friday
night at the Electronic Frontier Foundation's second annual
fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   As tech events go, EFF's gig was magnitudes more fun than the
norm, with people actually dancing instead of milling around
reading name tags.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment was provided by four amateur bands _ Where's
Julio, The Raving Daves, The Flying Other Brothers, and David Gans
and the Broken Angels _ whose members hail from local tech firms
like Excite and PeopleSoft.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the night was a success. EFF board member John
Gilmore said the group raised about $170,000, up from $130,000 last
year. EFF will use the money to lobby in favor of First Amendment
issues that relate to cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   And though my wife and I danced until the baby sitter demanded
that we return home, it did seem odd to see the light show project
the names of corporate sponsors like Merrill Lynch and Pacific Bell
on the brick walls where Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin rebelled
their way to fame.
</P>
<P>
   I guess the times, they are a changin'.

   He could not jump and he could not run, especially when his
aching back acted up. But Larry Bird could play basketball, and
Monday he received the ultimate confirmation of that when he was
elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people were elected. Three were players: Bird in his first
year of eligibility; Marques Haynes, who played more than 40 years
with the Harlem Globetrotters and then the Harlem Magicians, and
Arnie Risen, who played 13 seasons for three teams in the National
Basketball League and then the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   Four new members were coaches: Lenny Wilkens, now with the
Atlanta Hawks, who was elected as a player in 1989; Alex Hannum,
who coached 13 seasons for five teams in the NBA and the American
Basketball Association; Jody Conradt, who compiled a 592-146 record
with the University of Texas women's team, and Aleksandr Nikolic,
who coached Yugoslavia to the 1977 European championship and the
1978 world championship.
</P>
<P>
   Bird, a 6-foot-9-inch forward, played 13 seasons with the Boston
Celtics and led them to NBA championships in 1981, 1984 and 1986.
He was voted the league's most valuable player three times and an
All-Star 12 times. He retired in 1992. Last season, he became coach
of the Indiana Pacers, led them to the Eastern Conference finals
and was voted the NBA's coach of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, it's a great honor,'' he said. ``I am very
honored to be part of the Hall of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird's election was anticipated. It was also warmly received.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a guy who got the ultimate out of his own abilities,''
Oscar Robertson, another Hall of Fame player, told the Associated
Press. ``Because Larry, as far as having all the great athletic
ability, didn't have that. But he had a tremendous knowledge of the
game of basketball, and he was settled in the way he played. He was
a great basketball player, and he deserves to be in the Hall of
Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird quit early in his freshman year at Indiana University
before he ever played for Bob Knight and had to be talked into
transferring to Indiana State and playing again. Mel Daniels was an
assistant coach at Indiana State when Bird led the team to the NCAA
final in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``His love for the game and how effective he was at playing
basketball kind of made him understand that basketball had to be a
big part of his life,'' Daniels said.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Bird's election to the Hall of Fame, Daniels said simply,
``That's where he's supposed to be.''

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Doctors Make Online House Call  
   
 By Carl T. Hall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Getting answers to medical questions has always been one of the
prime reasons people go on the Internet. But while the Web is full
of health-related chatter, it's rife with misinformation and hype
about unproven treatments.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, some of the nation's top medical educators are wading
gingerly into the mess, hoping to add some long-needed quality
control and at the same time garner a little online visibility for
their institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to find junk on the Internet,'' said Dr. Tom
Ferguson, an Austin, Texas, physician and online-medicine expert.
``There's a lot of variability, but in many cases you can get stuff
now that's better than what you get from a doctor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at San Francisco has begun
collaborating with Oregon-based Sapient Health Networks, a
for-profit company that sponsors medical chat rooms for people with
certain chronic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors, nurses and other UCSF experts regularly log on as
moderators during discussions of subjects including weight control,
depression, heart disease, diabetes and cancer. A segment on
women's health includes topics such as menopause and uterine
fibroids.
</P>
<P>
   Chat rooms let people message each other online in real time.
Unlike Internet bulletin boards, chat rooms offer the advantage of
live conversation, but the content cannot be censored, and the
conversation gets confusing when multiple participants are all
typing at once.
</P>
<P>
   Other credibility-conscious Web sites include
 &LR; www.intelihealth.com &LR; , sponsored by Johns Hopkins University and
Aetna U.S. Healthcare. The site includes an ``Ask-The-Doc'' feature
that lets you post questions to Johns Hopkins physicians.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. C. Everett Koop, the former U.S. surgeon general, will have
his own site _  &LR; www.koop.com  &LR; _ &LR;   &LR; in about two weeks. Plans include
online support groups monitored by Koop and a panel of medical
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the UCSF venture say the Internet is ideal for
consumer health research if the quality problems can be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides a level of support you can't get in any other
medium,'' said JoAnne Saxe, a nurse practitioner and associate
clinical professor at the UCSF School of Nursing.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Teresa Wright, an expert on liver diseases, helps guide a
burgeoning group interested in hepatitis C.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some risks, but I think it's also a good opportunity
to get some information out to people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sapient chats, generally an hour long, are open only to
registered participants, but there's no fee to sign up and the
sponsors promise never to divulge your identity. Registration
forms, technical details and a schedule of the discussions can be
found at  &LR; www.shn.net,  &LR; which also includes transcripts of past
chat sessions arranged by subject matter.
</P>
<P>
   The site has about 100,000 registered users and is signing up
about 2,000 newcomers a week, said James Kean, Sapient's president
and co-founder &LR; . &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; The goal, he added, is to create a useful ``community
experience'' for people going through the intensely personal
experience of a chronic illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want a framework to help assess all the information
that's out there,'' Kean said. ``They want a reliable source for
all the breaking news that might concern them, and there's a real
urge to be connected to a community _ but it's got to be a
high-quality community.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no sure way to keep out fad promoters and disguised
commercial interests. But advance registration seems to help keep a
semblance of control.
</P>
<P>
   The moderators, backed by a cadre of well-informed patients and
family members, try to keep the discussions on point, frequently
challenging those making unsubstantiated claims or adding caveats
where needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient is relying on a business strategy that does not hinge on
building huge collections of eyeballs for advertisers, as is the
case for the big health-discussion groups on AOL and other online
services.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Sapient frequently conducts online surveys of its
customers, compiling answers into closely targeted consumer
research reports for drug companies and device makers.
</P>
<P>
   Such surveys are hot commodities given the quick turnaround time
and high degree of ``purity'' in the populations being sampled. A
single report can sell for $10,000 to $100,000, Kean said.
</P>
<P>
   Sapient guarantees to keep your identity _ and e-mail address _
private. Participants select an online pseudonym.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers are suspicious of health care companies. We consider
ourselves an intermediary,'' he added.

 Norton Tops Win 98's Wizard   By David Einstein  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   
   
 Q:  Does the Maintenance Wizard in Windows 98 do essentially the 
 same thing as Norton Utilities, which finds and fixes problems, 
 improves performance and troubleshoots? 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Ah, our first question about Windows 98! Maintenance
Wizard, which is new to Win 98, does in fact offer many of the
features that you get with a program such as Norton Utilities. It
lets you fix common hard disk problems, defragment the disk (also
called optimizing) and remove unnecessary files. You can even
schedule those operations to run on a regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   However, the $70 Norton Utilities offers some powerful features
beyond what Maintenance Wizard can conjure up. It can rescue
information from damaged disks, and recover files that may have
accidentally been erased.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Last month, my area code changed. That means the area &LR; 
 &LR; code also changed for the number I use to connect to the &LR; 
 &LR; Internet. How can I replace the old number with the new one? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Go to Windows Explorer, which you'll find under the
Programs menu after clicking the Windows Start button. In the
directory tree on the left side of the screen, click the entry
titled Dial-up Networking. This will display a list of connections.
Find the one for your Internet service provider and click using the
right mouse button. In the menu that appears choose Properties. Go
the tab labeled General and change the number, then click OK.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I'm searching for a handheld personal computer that I can &LR; 
 &LR; take outside the United States and use for Word, e-mail and &LR; 
 &LR; faxes. I've heard that phone lines in Europe are not compatible &LR; 
 &LR; with ours. Any suggestions? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; All the phone lines I've used in Europe have worked fine
with my laptop, and that includes Germany, Switzerland, France,
Italy and England. The problem is not the phone lines, but the
phone jacks, which are different for each country. You can buy a
set of international jacks at Radio Shack or at most big drug
stores.
</P>
<P>
   As for the computer, you'll need a handheld model that runs on
Windows CE (a smaller palm-sized PC doesn't let you do word
processing). You'll also need a modem. Some handhelds, like the
Philips Velo or Hewlett-Packard 660LX, come with modems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I am looking for software packages that I can use to &LR; 
 &LR; create a living trust. Hope you can help. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Living trusts, for those who don't know, are like wills,
only they let your heirs avoid having to go through lengthy probate
proceedings. When you transfer property to a living trust, it's
owned by the trust, not by you as an individual. But as trustee,
you can keep full control of it. After you die, the successor
trustee is in charge of transferring the property to family,
friends and charities you named as beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Software packages for creating living trusts include Living
Trust Maker, from Nolo ($48) and Living Trust Builder, from Jian
($33). Since I haven't used them, I don't know how good they are.
But I believe they are valid in most states, just like
computer-generated wills.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; Please help me solve a problem that has been nagging me. &LR; 
 &LR; Does it do any harm to turn off the computer without proper &LR; 
 &LR; shut-down? I often do that because it gets stuck in the &LR;   &LR; ``please
wait'' part of the shut- &LR;   &LR; down process, and the advice on the
Microsoft Web site for &LR;   &LR; troubleshooting this problem is too
complicated to begin. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; It shouldn't inflict any permanent damage if you fail to
complete the shut-down procedure. However, the next time you start
the computer (as you've probably already learned), it may check the
system for errors before Windows boots up. And that can take a few
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, why is your system hanging during shut-down?
Unfortunately, the problem could be half a dozen things, including
startup files, memory conflicts or system settings. If you can't
live with the situation, you might consider just reinstalling
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Tip of the Week &QC; 
Give your right hand, wrist and elbow a break by switching your
mouse to the left hand for a while. You can easily reverse the
left-right button functions by going to the Mouse icon in the
Windows Control Panel (click Start, point to settings and choose
Control Panel).

   (NYT12) GREENWICH, Conn. -- June 29, 1998 -- STANTONS-RIGHTS,
6-29 -- In 1848, an upstate New York housewife named Elizabeth Cady
Stanton assembled a convention in a Seneca Falls church and made
the radical demand that women be allowed to vote. The fourth, fifth

students Joel Hensley, center, and Kurt Franke. Chu, the master of
manipulating atoms and molecules who shared the most recent Nobel
Prize in Physics with two other researchers, alternates taking

   (NYT10) BOMBAY, India -- June 29, 1998 -- INDIA-BUSINESS-LUNCH,
6-29 -- The intricate trade of the tiffin-wallah has changed little
in 130 years. Jaganath Adav pushes a handcart filled with
home-cooked lunches through Bombay's business district. By all
accounts, the system is virtually fail-safe, aside from train
strikes or accidents, or the unreported sickness or death of a
carrier. Ask a tiffin-wallah when he last failed a customer, and he
will scratch his head. ``Never, that I remember,'' says Adav. (John

life-size yard unique is that the lawn itself, along with
everything on it, is formed by millions of tiny glass beads. ``The

Liam Neeson is starring in ``The Judas Kiss.'' He plays Oscar Wilde

He's practically a broken man, which two years' hard labor did to

One day, without explanation, the artist took a sledgehammer to it,
nearly destroying the work before one of his servants dragged him

Mashkan-shapir, a 4,000-year-old Mesopotamian city. It was a
relatively large city of 15,000 people in the early second
millennium B.C., which, after a brief period of glory, declined and
was abandoned in 1720 B.C. Mashkan-shapir's ruins disappeared in
the desert until archeologists began digging there in this century.

HILTON GAMBLING SPLIT-OFF SEEN, THEN MERGER WITH GRAND CASINOS

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hilton Hotels Corp. is expected to announce on
Tuesday that it will split its hotel and gambling operations into
separate companies and will merge the gaming company with the
Mississippi gambling operations of Grand Casinos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton shareholders are expected to receive one share in each of
the gaming and hotel companies for each share they now own,
according to executives close to the situation. Grand Casinos is
expected to spin off its Mississippi operations into a separate
company. The Hilton gaming unit and Grand Casinos' Mississippi
spinoff would then merge in a pooling of interests.
</P>
<P>
   The price for Grand Casinos will depend on the value of the
stock in Hilton's gaming company and the value of the stock in
Grand Casinos' Mississippi operations and on the ratio in which
they are exchanged in the merger. Grand Casinos has a market value
of $780 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton executives have said in the past that splitting the
companies will benefit shareholders by freeing the hotel business,
which is doing well, from the gambling business, which is under
pressure because of a glut of hotel rooms in Las Vegas, Nev. Now,
officials and analysts have said, Hilton's stock price is being
held back by its association with the gaming business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the gaming business is kind of the Rodney
Dangerfield of the stock market,'' Hilton's chief executive,
Stephen F. Bollenbach, told securities analysts in April in a
conference call to discuss earnings. He said that splitting the
Beverly Hills company was a high priority because Hilton's shares
were trading at ``a conglomerate discount.''
</P>
<P>
   Combining Hilton's gaming business with that of Grand Casinos
would create a gambling giant with a presence in the nation's three
largest gaming markets. The two companies have little overlap, with
Hilton strong in Las Vegas and Atlantic City, while Grand is the
largest operator of casinos in Mississippi. Grand also manages
three Indian casinos, but that part of its business will not go to
Hilton.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Hilton and Grand Casinos said Monday that it was
their policy not to comment on rumors.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, if it goes through, would make the third time a charm
for Bollenbach, who has faltered in two previous attempts at
mergers and is under shareholder pressure to achieve some deal.
``Our shareholders expect us to be a transactional company,'' he
told analysts earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Hilton failed last year in a protracted attempt to buy the
ITT Corp., which owned the Sheraton hotel chain and Caesars
casinos. ITT was taken over instead by Starwood Hotels and Resorts
Trust.
</P>
<P>
   This year, merger talks between Hilton and Circus Circus
Enterprises broke down. The companies were negotiating a split of
Hilton to be followed by a combination of its gaming business with
Circus _ a deal similar to what is expected on Tuesday. But the
talks fell apart over price and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Those missteps have slightly tarnished the reputation Bollenbach
had earned as a savvy deal maker for his major roles in splitting
the old Marriott Corp. into two companies, rescuing Donald J.
Trump's troubled empire and engineering the Walt Disney Co.'s
acquisition of ABC.
</P>
<P>
   He was recruited to run Hilton in early 1996 by Barron Hilton,
the son of the founder and now the company's chairman, and promptly
bought Bally Entertainment for about $3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the timing of the latest deal could raise some eyebrows.
Tuesday is the deadline for Hilton to enter into a major
transaction that would entitle Bollenbach to accelerated vesting of
his stock options under his employment contract. But a Hilton
spokesman has said that Bollenbach voluntarily waived those rights
so as to avoid the appearance that he was pushing Hilton into a
transaction for his own gain.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton has been wanting to split into two companies but decided
it also needed a merger to provide a business purpose that would
bolster the deal's chances of qualifying for tax-free status. In
addition, the combination with Grand Casinos would add some heft to
the gaming company, although Hilton by itself is already among the
world's largest gambling companies.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected that Arthur M. Goldberg, the head of Hilton's
gaming operations, will run the combined gaming company, though
Grand Casinos management is also expected to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Grand Casinos slipped 6.25 cents Monday, to $18.50,
and Hilton shares rose 81.25 cents, to $31.50, both on the New York
Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   There was an extraordinarily high volume of trading in Grand
Casinos Inc. options last Friday as rumors of a deal spread.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Casinos has grown quickly from a start running one Indian
casino in 1991. In 1997 it had net income of $66.1 million on
revenue of $607.4 million. Most of the revenue came from its three
Mississippi casinos. But Grand Casinos stumbled badly in its
investment in the Stratosphere hotel in Las Vegas, which filed for
bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Casinos wrote off its entire investment. Its contracts to
manage Indian casinos, which will be the main business of the
company that is not spun off to merge with Hilton, are set to
expire by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Of more concern to Hilton is that next year Mirage Resorts,
generally considered the builder of the nation's most spectacular
casinos, will open a major resort near Grand Casinos' operations in
Biloxi and Gulfport. That could draw business away from Grand
Casinos, although it could also attract more gamblers to the area
and actually help Grand Casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have speculated that once Hilton's hotel
operations are free from its gaming business, it could be an
acquisition candidate or make an acquisition on its own. Hilton has
had some discussions with Ladbroke Group PLC, the British company
that controls the Hilton brand outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although talks on a merger do not seem to have gone very far,
the companies have agreed on a common, worldwide logo.

home-cooked lunches through Bombay's business district. By all
accounts, the system is virtually fail-safe, aside from train

BE PRACTICAL, SAY CHINESE-AMERICANS IN BACKING CLINTON'S TRIP
</HEADLINE>

 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As President Clinton deflects criticism from both
politicians in the United States and students in Beijing over his
trip to China, he is finding unwavering _ and somewhat surprising _
support from Chinese immigrants in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether they originally hailed from mainland
China, Taiwan or Hong Kong, immigrants in the New York metropolitan
area have applauded Clinton's trip, saying his mission benefits
both the United States and China for economic, political and
cultural reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, critics in Washington accused Clinton of kowtowing to
a government with a human rights record that only brutal regimes
would envy. Monday, Chinese students at Beijing University grilled
Clinton as well, questioning whether the United States was secretly
trying to isolate China politically.
</P>
<P>
   But as Clinton continues his trip to the world's largest
totalitarian state, interviews with more than two dozen Chinese
immigrants interviewed over two days revealed a more practical
assessment: Human rights are secondary to economic progress and
Sino-American relations. And anyone who disagrees with that, they
say bluntly, simply does not understand China, or the Chinese
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think most Americans understand why Clinton's trip is
so good,'' said Daniel Chao, 35, of Edison, N.J., who grew up in
Shanghai and was eating Sunday at Joe's Shanghai in Flushing,
Queens. ``It's very important for the long-term Sino-American
relationship that Clinton have a chance to get first-hand
information, and talk about the real issues with the Chinese
leaders and the Chinese people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the immigrants say, Clinton's trip has
tremendous symbolic value for people who, invariably, place a lot
of meaning on symbols and gestures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all Chinese, and this raises the profile of all Chinese
people,'' said Johnson Wang, 67, of Jersey City, N.J., a
Taiwanese-American who was purchasing lottery tickets at the Port
Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan on Sunday. ``We are especially
proud of the fact that this trip is nine days _ the longest ever by
Clinton!''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, it might appear that Chinese immigrants would
have disparate views. After all, Chinese immigrants in New York
include the old guard from Taiwan and Hong Kong, who have been
major backers of Taiwan's Nationalist government, and political
arrivistes from Fujian province in southern China, who have been
partial to China's Communist Government. Throw in smaller segments
of people whose modus operandi range from Taiwan independence to
Tibetan independence, and the result is a fluid, vibrant community
that, more often than not, agrees to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to matters of national or ethnic pride, many
Chinese immigrants cast typical allegiances aside. Blood, not
politics, prevails.
</P>
<P>
   So it went with the return of Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty
in 1997. So it went with President Jiang Zemin's visit to New York
in December. And so it has gone with Clinton's trip.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the immigrants interviewed failed to mention the
eminence of economic reform and Sino-American trade relations when
asked about the vital points of Clinton's trip. It is through
economic reform, they say, that China will become a freer society.
</P>
<P>
   Political reform, they added, is a consequence of economic
reform _ and should be treated accordingly. Even the 1989 massacre
in Tiananmen Square _ considered by many Americans to be the symbol
of the Chinese regime _ is viewed by most Chinese-Americans as an
incident that, while tragic, should be consigned to history.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened, happened,'' said Jane Eng, a Hong Kong
immigrant and manager of the Nancy Wedding Center, a bustling
bridal shop on the Bowery. ``We cannot just sit here and wait for a
conclusion. We have to take the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason why Chinese-Americans may appear to be
relatively blase about human rights is that their definition of
what a person's basic rights ought to be is different from what
other Americans usually think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights are the ability to have enough food, clothing,
education and shelter,'' said Chunde Shi, 36, a former urban
planner in Beijing who now works as a computer consultant in the
New York area. ``Only after you have these can you think about
things like democracy and freedom.''

EDITORIAL: NEW ALLIANCES IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 30:
</P>
<P>
   The week ahead contains two important events in Northern
Ireland. Wednesday the region's new assembly will meet for the
first time, and Sunday marks the date of the most explosive of the
yearly parades. In both cases, a small group of determined
opponents can thwart the desire for peace expressed by the great
majority of voters.
</P>
<P>
   The parades, celebrating Protestant victories of 300 years ago,
are an annual source of tension. This year the British government
took the smart step of forming a bipartisan commission to rule on
the routes marchers may take. Monday the commission decided that
the Orange Order may not take its Drumcree march through the
Catholic Garvaghy Road in Portadown. The Orange Order has refused
to comply. Catholic residents, equally intransigent, vow to greet
the march with a protest.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Ulster Constabulary must uphold the parade
commission's ruling, which is the law, and do so without the heavy
use of plastic bullets and other violent measures. Britain has
wisely sent reinforcements, in the form of 1,000 soldiers. But the
best solution would be a compromise between local Catholics and
Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   While the parade season looks dishearteningly familiar, the
opening of the new assembly shows that things are changing in
Northern Ireland. The 108 members elected last week meet for the
first time Wednesday. The assembly can work only if politicians
break out of their sectarian thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Members will choose a first minister, who is expected to be
David Trimble, leader of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party. His
deputy is likely to be John Hume, head of the largely Catholic
Social Democratic and Labor Party. Trimble will find himself
governing a body and heading a cabinet that includes Sinn Fein, the
political wing of the Irish Republican Army. He still does not
speak to its members. But he is now Sinn Fein's ally in making the
assembly work, against the hard-line Protestants whose views he
once shared. That journey took courage and vision.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-liners oppose the peace agreement, especially because
the assembly will get no powers until a body linking its members
with Irish legislators is in place. They have nearly enough members
to sabotage the assembly on key votes, so a few defections from
Trimble's party would be fatal. That threat makes Trimble very
vulnerable to pressure from the small anti-accord group.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein's president, Gerry Adams, like Trimble, faces a
paradox. He badly needs to prevent those Ulster Unionists from
defecting. He could help by joining Trimble in pressing the IRA to
begin giving up its arms. The idea of cross-community alliances is
startling and strange for Northern Ireland. When they happen, we
will know that the peace process is working. &QL;

AMERICANS SEE LIVE ACCESS TO CHINESE TV AS HIGHLIGHT OF SUMMIT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ It was not until minutes before the Saturday
news conference by President Clinton and President Jiang Zemin that
the Chinese leader decided to allow the event to be broadcast live.
</P>
<P>
   And Jiang did not inform the United States that he would permit
the broadcast of Clinton's Beijing University speech on Monday
until less than an hour before the address was to begin.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said Monday that they were elated at both
decisions, which had been a central demand of the United States and
gave an American President unfiltered access to the Chinese people
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   American officials also said that progress at the summit on the
spread of weapons technology and the joint agreement not to aim
nuclear weapons at each other's cities were important, though
largely symbolic. It was the live television access to the Chinese
audience that made the summit meeting a breakthrough, according to
American officials.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials were still puzzling over just what
prompted Jiang to make the call.
</P>
<P>
   One theory they put forward to reporters as Clinton flew from
the Chinese capital to Shanghai was that Jiang used Clinton as a
sort of ventriloquist's dummy to raise the most sensitive topics in
Chinese society and then to defend his position to the Chinese
people and to reactionaries in his own government.
</P>
<P>
   Another school of thought was that Jiang knew how much the
American side valued access to the Chinese audience, and was not
willing to risk harming the relationship by denying that access.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that these decisions were made at the
highest level, by Jiang himself,'' said a senior American official.
``One can only speculate about his motivation. They recognized that
the price of engagement with us was giving us access to their
people. Jiang knew he needed to do that to make this a successful
summit.''
</P>
<P>
   It remained uncertain how deep or lasting an impact these events
would have on Chinese politics and society. Nor was it likely that
Clinton had silenced his critics at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real answer is going to come not from American officials,
but, of course, from the people of China,'' said Stanley Roth,
assistant secretary of state for East Asia. ``And we've seen
repeated quotes in the press from people indicating that it will
have profound reverberations from here. I think this will be
percolating within China for quite some time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's aides were unreservedly crowing Monday about the
``extraordinary,'' and ``historic'' summit meeting, and they
arranged a briefing for reporters by a senior official to talk ``on
background'' about all the 18 months of preparation Clinton and his
staff had made to pull off the event.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day meeting in Beijing was the fruit of a risky decision
in November 1996 to conduct reciprocal summit meetings in
Washington and Beijing without any conditions, and thus no
guarantee of success, the official said, giving this account of
what happened:
</P>
<P>
   The first of the two summit meetings, in Washington in October,
was judged a success by both sides. The meeting produced a handful
of substantive agreements, including China's pledge to stop sending
missiles to Iran and aiding Pakistan's nuclear program, and a
deepening of the personal relationship between Clinton and Jiang.
The two countries set up a bug-proof hotline between their
capitals, a link that was used for the first time in May after the
Indian nuclear tests. It was the first time that an American
President and a Chinese leader had spoken by telephone, according
to American officials.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere for the meeting in Beijing was more difficult,
the official said, with controversies swirling in the United States
over allegations of Chinese meddling in the 1996 Presidential
election and the suspected pilfering of sensitive American
technology through the launch of American satellites on Chinese
rockets.
</P>
<P>
   But administration officials turned the difficult domestic
climate to their advantage, according to an account by a
high-ranking participant. The crescendo of criticism and a series
of congressional hearings on Chinese missiles and money put Clinton
in a quandary. He could cancel the summit meeting _ as 151 members
of Congress demanded _ or he could travel to Beijing without any
assurance that the meeting would bring results.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the president's national security adviser, went to
Beijing the first week of June with two messages for Jiang. He told
the Chinese leader that Clinton was ``unshakable'' in his
determination to make the summit meeting. But, he added, the
meeting had to produce a positive outcome or risk giving Clinton's
critics new ammunition and setting back United States-China
relations for months, or longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was not a summit that moved the relationship forward,
it would feed the critics back home,'' a senior administration
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions boiled down to one central concern on the
American side, which they believed would nurture the relationship
while quieting domestic critics: Clinton must have access to the
Chinese people, through television, radio and public appearances
that were not unduly restricted by the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leadership was noncommittal on the access question,
as well as the substantive matters still under discussion _ the
targeting of nuclear missiles, the spread of weapons technology and
human rights. Berger returned to Washington uneasy about the
meeting, then less than three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ``As always with the Chinese, nothing much happens before the
end game,'' a senior White House aide said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Berger's deputy, James Steinberg, flew to Beijing on June 22,
four days before Clinton was to arrive in China, to try to nail
down progress on the nuclear targeting plan and China's membership
in an international non-proliferation agreement known as the
Missile Technology Control Regime.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of word-by-word negotiation of the statement on the
missile agreement, Steinberg and his Cambridge-educated Chinese
counterpart, Yang Jiechi, agreed that the two nations would
announce that China would ``actively consider joining'' the missile
accord. American officials consider that a significant step that
will ultimately lead to China's acceptance of international rules
governing sales of medium- and long-range missiles capable of
carrying nuclear, biological and chemical warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The talks on the targeting of nuclear missiles went down to the
wire. On Friday, American officials expressed doubt that a deal
could be reached, because the Chinese insisted that the United
States renounce any first use of nuclear weapons, a policy change
the United States was unwilling to make. Agreement was finally
reached late Friday night, and was announced Saturday morning at
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   One large question remained: Would Jiang permit the live
broadcast? Although American officials did not indicate in advance
that Clinton intended to criticize the Chinese crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in 1989, Jiang
appeared prepared for the rhetorical broadside. And he in fact
invited Clinton to respond to his comments on Tibet and other human
rights issues, rather than curtailing the news conference, as he
easily could have.

EDITORIAL: A DEVIOUS ATTACK ON CHOICE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 30:
</P>
<P>
   The Republican effort to curtail abortion rights took a stealthy
and dangerous turn last week when the House voted 223-202 to
prohibit the Food and Drug Administration from testing or approving
any drug that induces abortion, including RU-486, a drug that the
FDA has approved for use in controlled studies. For several years
now, anti-abortion forces have tried to win public support by
focusing their rhetoric on late-term abortions. This latest move
shows that they want to block all methods, including the earliest
and least invasive forms of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents say the measure, which is attached to a $56
billion agriculture appropriations bill, merely prevents taxpayer
money from being used to facilitate abortion. But unlike bans on
federal funding for abortions, which are already in place, this
measure goes a step further.
</P>
<P>
   It directly attacks the ability of the FDA to review abortion
drugs, and would essentially outlaw this method of abortion even if
it is safe and effective. Moreover, the House sets a terrible
precedent by loading ideology on the drug approval process. If this
is allowed to stand, the public's access to effective drugs will
become a matter of politics, decided by members of Congress rather
than clinical research.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate should reject this measure as a dangerous intrusion
into the functions of the FDA as well as an attack on the
constitutionally protected right to choose abortion. President
Clinton must also make clear that he will veto the agriculture
appropriations bill if it arrives on his desk containing this kind
of limitation. &QL;

WOMEN SURPASS MEN IN EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENT, CENSUS REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Census Bureau reported Monday for the first
time that young women are completing high school and graduating
from college at higher rates than their male peers.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau said that in 1997, 89 percent of women ages 25 to 29
had finished high school, compared with 86 percent of men the same
age. In addition, census officials said that women in the 25 to 29
age group also led men when it came to college completion rates: 29
percent for women, compared with 26 percent for men.
</P>
<P>
   Census officials said it was the second year that young women
had outpaced men in educational attainment. But the bureau releases
its report on education attainment only every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Achievement by young women and young men had been nearly equal
in the 10-year period before 1996, Census Bureau researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two years, young women have spurted ahead,
creating for the first time in the country's history a cohort of
women that is better educated than its male counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen the male and female neck and neck for a long
time,'' said Jennifer Day, chief of the Census Bureau's Education
and Social Stratification Branch, which compiled the report.
``They've just started to pull ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, adult males are somewhat more educated than adult
women, according to the report, titled, ``Educational Attainment in
the United States: March 1997.'' About 82 percent of males and
females 25 years and older have high school diplomas or general
equivalency degrees. But about 26 percent of men in this large age
group have graduated from college, compared with 22 percent of
women.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republican politicians and strategists
say they are troubled by a wave of harsh anti-homosexual oratory
from fellow Republicans, fearing it could make the party appear
intolerant and drive out moderates and economic conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are not limited to moderate Republicans. Many
conservatives said the recent attacks on homosexuality by party
leaders, candidates and local Republican officials could spur a
reprise of the 1992 presidential campaign, when intramural
skirmishes over issues like abortion turned off the wider
electorate in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said the blunt comments, notably those made
in a recent interview by Sen. Trent Lott, R.-Miss., stemmed from a
determination among some in the party to score points with the
right wing and energize hard-core Republican voters. Lott, the
Republican leader, had likened homosexuality to kleptomania,
alcoholism and sex addiction.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans condemned the attacks as short-sighted.
``The Republican Party has tripped over its own shoelaces and found
itself on the defensive,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist
and former head of the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., took issue with his colleagues
who contend that such statements ``might energize the party.'' He
said, ``I don't believe the party is likely to grow stronger or our
voters more numerous through attacks on minorities, whether they be
sexual minorities or religious or racial minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Most accept that the remarks by Lott and Rep. Dick Armey,
R-Texas, the majority leader, and many others reflect their genuine
belief that homosexuality is a sin. What has changed is that there
now is greater willingness among Republicans to speak bluntly
instead of couching their beliefs in politically agreeable
language.
</P>
<P>
   The shift appears to have been spurred by conservative leaders,
notably Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council and Dr. James
Dobson of the ``Focus on the Family'' radio talk show. The two are
pressing lawmakers to emphasize their opposition to homosexuality
as part of a social-issues agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a demand from some quarters that we aggressively
attack the homosexual community,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough,
R-Fla., one of the most conservative House members. While he said
the comments make some Republicans look like ``strident, right-wing
cartoon characters,'' Scarborough added, ``There's not a real
political downside right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough, who is 35, said his position on gay rights was
probably not much different from Lott's or others who have spoken
out. Yet he suggested there was a generational difference, and that
younger people like himself were more careful about their language
because ``we have all had friends who are gay and understand that
they are not the demons that they're made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some Republicans conceded that their party could not
expect wide support from gay rights advocates, they said their
biggest worry would be that the comments would offend so-called
swing voters in the suburbs who are not particularly loyal to one
party or another.
</P>
<P>
   John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster, said his surveys show
the attacks on homosexuality offend voters even in the most
conservative parts of the South. ``In a lot of areas, this is not a
threat to their values and their hometowns and their communities,''
he said of homosexuals. But by raising the issue, he said, ``it
makes Republicans look out of touch, like they care about things
the voters don't care about.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said his polling also found that the anti-gay oratory
``makes Republicans look mean-spirited. Ronald Reagan may have been
``anti-gay,'' he said, ``but he wasn't somebody who disliked
people.''
</P>
<P>
   William Pascoe III, political director of the American
Conservative Union, also said the anti-gay oratory would benefit
Republicans. ``Anytime you have Republican leaders citing the Bible
as the foundation for their beliefs,'' he said, ``as opposed to
Democratic leaders citing the American Psychiatric Association, I
think we win.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans condemned the attacks as short-sighted.
``The Republican Party has tripped over its own shoe laces and
found itself on the defensive,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican
strategist and the former executive director of the Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In his former position, Reed was careful not to attack
homosexuals directly but instead capitalized on the issue by using
code words like the coalition's belief in the ``sanctity of
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk that Reed and other Republicans spoke of could not be
quantified. But they said they feared that the blunt comments could
cost the party not only moderates who favor homosexual rights but
quite conservative Republicans who might consider attacks on
homosexuals mean-spirited or inappropriate for a party that should
concern itself with more pressing legislative matters.
</P>
<P>
   While leading Republicans insisted that there was no
orchestrated drive in the party to go after homosexuals, there has
been a drumbeat of criticism in recent days. The most notable came
from Lott. His supporters said his remarks helped him with
conservatives who were furious when he criticized the Navy last
year for ousting 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn on charges relating to from
adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Several conservatives said comments in support of Lott by Armey,
who wants to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker, were intended to
help him win favor with conservative House members who believe he
has not been honest in acknowledging his role in the failed coup
attempt against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible is very clear on this,'' Armey said, adding that
``both myself and Sen. Lott believe very strongly in the Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published on Monday, Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, a longtime foe of homosexuals, stepped up his criticism.
``They start by pretending that it is just another form of love,''
he told Congressional Quarterly. ``It's sickening.'' Helms was
responding to a new documentary that criticizes his treatment of
homosexuals.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Asked about comments such as Lott's, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
said, ``I don't believe in discrimination of any kind.'' He said
the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization, ``should be part of
our party.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions are reminiscent of the 1996 presidential contest,
when Bob Dole's campaign was thrown into turmoil when it returned a
contribution from the Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican Party, said the
denunciations of homosexuality could be politically beneficial
because ``when people are honest about their views most people
respect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said of the comments: ``I'm not concerned about what
any of those leaders have said. I agree with them. I don't know
that we fully understand very much about the sources of
homosexuality or if there is a way to alter that. I've talked to
some people in both the scientific and theological communities, and
they don't seem to be very clear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Republican leaders in Texas barred the Log
Cabin Republicans from setting up a booth at the party's state
convention. Robert Black, a party spokesman, inflamed the issue
when he likened the group to the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is weighing a bid for
President in 2000, won praise from Reed and other Republicans by
trying to tamp down the oratory from the state party. A statement
issued by his office said, ``Gov. Bush believes all individuals
deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. While he differs
with the Log Cabin Republicans on issues such as gay marriage, he
does not condone name calling.''
</P>
<P>
   That same weekend, at a gathering of Republican presidential
aspirants in Iowa, Bauer appeared with Reggie White, the Green Bay
Packers star who had called homosexuality ``one of the biggest sins
in the Bible.'' And another prospective contender, Steve Forbes,
appeared with the Rev. Louis Sheldon, a vociferous critic of
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he spoke briefly with Lott after he made his comments
_ and he expressed no regrets. ``I told him to hang in there,''
Bauer recalled. ``But he was feeling OK. Apparently he got a lot of
phone calls from people saying that they admired his courage.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continues among Republicans, this much is clear:
Lott no longer wants to talk about homosexuals. Asked about his
remarks, he replied, ``I think enough has probably already been
said about that.'' He then stuck out his tongue and sputtered into
a reporter's tape recorder.

`UNKNOWN' FROM VIETNAM IS IDENTIFIED AS AIR FORCE PILOT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for new 6th graf with Blassie family statement; minor editing
changes throughout)  (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The remains of an unidentified American serviceman
from the Vietnam War, buried beneath the Tomb of the Unknowns in
Arlington National Cemetery 14 years ago, are no longer unknown.
</P>
<P>
   They belong to First Lt. Michael Blassie, an Air Force pilot
whose attack jet crashed on May 11, 1972, near a village in South
Vietnam called An Loc. He was 24 at the time and ever since has,
officially, been considered missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   A new type of genetic test _ not available when President Ronald
Reagan honored the ``unknown soldier'' from the Vietnam War at a
symbolic state funeral on Memorial Day 1984 _ has matched DNA taken
from the remains with DNA from Blassie's mother, officials at the
Pentagon said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon removed the remains from the Tomb of the Unknowns
last month after a lengthy investigation ordered by Secretary of
Defense William Cohen concluded that the remains very likely
belonged to one of nine Americans killed in Vietnam, including
Blassie. The lieutenant's family had urged the Pentagon to conduct
the DNA tests after news reports raised questions about the
identity of the Unknown Soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who presided over the disinterment at what is one of the
nation's most revered memorials, just across the Potomac River from
Washington, is scheduled to announce the results at the Pentagon on
Tuesday, but the families of the nine missing Americans were
notified by telephone on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The lieutenant's family declined on Monday night to comment
until it received official confirmation of the Pentagon's findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Blassies have said they wanted to take Blassie's remains
home to the suburbs of St. Louis, where he was reared. They have
said they want to bury him at Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery,
near the grave of his father, George, a veteran of World War II who
died in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The identification of the remains, which until last month lay
with unknown soldiers from the two World Wars and the Korean War,
has now raised the possibility that there will not be another set
of remains put in the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Pentagon have already begun to ask whether
there should even be a new search for an unknown soldier. Although
2,087 Americans remain missing from Vietnam and unidentified
remains have been gathered, the advances in genetic testing have
made it highly unlikely that any set of remains can be called
``unknown'' with absolute certainty.
</P>
<P>
   If a new set of remains were placed in the tomb, one official
said, ``you'd have to relive this chapter over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   Blassie, a graduate of the Air Force Academy, died when his
A-37B attack jet crashed in flames outside An Loc, a hotly
contested village near the border with Cambodia. Because of the
intense fighting, the site of the crash could not be searched and
his remains recovered.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until five months later that a South Vietnamese
patrol reached the spot and recovered four ribs, the right humerus
and part of the pelvis, as well as a collection of personal items,
including Blassie's identification card and remnants of a flight
suit.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Pentagon's investigation, the remains were
tentatively identified as Blassie's based on that evidence. In
1978, however, the Pentagon's Central Identification Laboratory in
Hawaii found that neither the blood type of the remains nor the
size of the humerus matched Blassie's. By then, some of the
personal items were lost, and the remains were reclassified as
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's investigation then reviewed the records for all
known casualties near An Loc, concluding earlier this year that the
remains likely belonged to one of nine Americans, all pilots or
crew members.
</P>
<P>
   Using the new tests, which were approved for use only in 1995,
the Pentagon compared a sample of mitochondrial DNA removed from
the pelvis last month with samples from maternal relatives of eight
of the nine. (There was no maternal relative of the ninth.)
</P>
<P>
   The sample matched Blassie's mother, Jean.
</P>
<P>
   For the other families, the uncertainties remain. Althea
Strobridge, the mother of Capt. Rodney Strobridge, said in a
telephone interview on Monday night that while she was happy for
the Blassies, for her at least, nothing had changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's circumstantial evidence, including the blood
type, had made Strobridge the most likely other match. The captain,
a 30-year-old Army helicopter pilot, was shot down in the same area
and on the same day in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   At first Mrs. Strobridge said she did not really want to open
the Tomb of the Unknowns to test the remains. Six years after
Strobridge disappeared, his family, including his mother and his
wife, Pat, held a memorial service and officially accepted his
death. A white gravestone was placed in his memory at Arlington,
not far from the Tomb of the Unknowns.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mrs. Strobridge, who lives in Perry, Iowa, agreed to give
a sample of her blood for the tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brought it all back so vividly,'' she said.

EDITORIAL: SEASON WITHOUT A DUNK? 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 30:
</P>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association, unlike professional
football, baseball and hockey, has never had its games disrupted by
a labor dispute. That may be about to change.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA owners say they are paying the players so much that the
league is no longer profitable, and so they will lock out the
players, beginning at midnight Tuesday night, until the players'
union agrees to a method to hold down the growth of salaries.
</P>
<P>
   For basketball fans, the first impact of this dispute will be in
the world championships this summer. The team of NBA stars that was
to play for the United States will now stay home, to be replaced by
a team chosen from players either in college or not good enough to
be in the NBA. That will make for a more competitive tournament
that the American team will be unlikely to win.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA now has a ``cap'' on total team salaries, but that cap
has done a better job of holding down the salaries of rookies and
of journeymen players than it has of halting the escalation of star
salaries. The rules allow a team to pay any amount it wishes to
re-sign its own players, enabling the Chicago Bulls to pay $33
million to Michael Jordan last season, when the supposed cap for an
entire team was $26.9 million. Younger stars try to maneuver their
way onto richer teams that will be able to pay cap-busting
salaries. The owners want a new contract that will bar them from
throwing so much money at the best players.
</P>
<P>
   Under the league's current contract, salaries of rookies and
journeymen players have been reined in to some extent. More players
now make something close to the league minimum _ currently $272,000
for veterans _ than once did, and young stars are limited to less
than $3 million a year until their fourth year. The fact that stars
cannot truly cash in until their fourth year has encouraged college
undergraduates and even high school players to turn pro as soon as
they can, so that the fourth year will come when they are still
relatively young.
</P>
<P>
   Each side appears to be entering this lockout convinced that the
other will cave. The NBA's television contracts will keep money
coming in all season even if no games are played. The players think
they have a legal trump card, which they could play by dissolving
their union and then arguing that antitrust laws bar any limits on
salaries in the absence of a collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   It is obviously in both sides' interests to make a deal. But
rationality does not always prevail in labor talks, and this could
be a confrontation in which no one blinks until a large part of the
season _ or even all of it _ has been canceled. &QL;

 &HT;    Wohlers ready to return to game
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mark Wohlers graduated Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves closer will be joining the Richmond Braves, Atlanta's
Class AAA affiliate, tonight after working out in Orlando for the
past 10 days to regain his control. He is expected to be in
Richmond's bullpen in Durham, N.C., for the R-Braves' International
League game with the Durham Bulls, which this season beame a Tampa
Bay farm club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a matter of his delivery and mechanics and his
confidence in all those things,'' Atlanta general manager John
Schuerholz said. ``He'd gotten to the point where he had complete
confidence and consistency with all the pitches he was throwing. We
all just feel like it's time to go out and face some competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz took that recommendation in a Monday-morning
telephone call from special assistant Guy Hansen, who has been
working with Wohlers the past week at the team's minor-league
complex. Hansen will stop working with Wohlers, who now will pitch
for highly respected Richmond coach Bill Fischer, a long-time
fixture in the system who coached Wohlers during his minor-league
career.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves still have no master plan for Wohlers' return nor
will they estimate how long he will remain with Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``No general plan but to go pitch,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-20 club
</P>
<P>
   Both Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine will get one more start before
the All-Star break but with 11 wins each, both have a leg up on
twin 20-win seasons. It may not a rarity for them _ both reached 20
in 1992 and 1993 _ but it remains a rare feat in the National
League. Over the last 27 years, only two other clubs have had two
20-win pitchers _ San Francisco in 1993 with Bill Swift and John
Burkett and St. Louis in 1985 with Joaquin Andujar and John Tudor.
</P>
<P>
   Glavine has had three 20-win seasons, Maddux has had two but
neither has one since 1993. Maddux has subsequently twice won 19
while Glavine has topped out at 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty wins as a pitcher is the same thing as a hitter hitting
.300,'' Glavine said. ``It's kind of the number that's out there
all the time. I guess that defines a great season, rather than just
a good one. I still feel I can have a good season and not win 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Over his career, Glavine's winning percentage has dipped
slightly in the second half of the season (.635 to .574) while
Maddux's winning percentage has increased in the second half (.605
to .659).
</P>
<P>
   Simon says
</P>
<P>
   Batting .254 at Richmond when the Braves re-called him, Randall
Simon was hitting for his lowest average since his first season of
rookie ball (.254 at Danville in 1993). After hitting a career-high
.308 at Richmond last year, Simon explained the fall-off as a
combination of the International League's decision to pitch him
more cautiously and his own inability to lay off pitches off the
plate. Then he begain listening to Richmond hitting coach Max
Venable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been giving me the advice to go take more walks and give
my teammates an opportunity to do the job,'' Simon said. ``I've
started doing that more they they're starting to pitch to me a
little more.''
</P>
<P>
   That advice may have been lost in handling when he reported to
the Braves on Sunday. The first pitch he saw in his first at-bat,
he singled.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and cold
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko and Andruw Jones are swinging the hottest bats as
the Braves take their last road trip of the first half. Klesko
enters the Tampa Bay series with nine multi-hit games in his last
16 starts, while Jones is hitting .356 in June. Javy Lopez, who
takes an eight-game hitting streak into tonight's game, has 18 RBIs
in his last 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Tony Graffanino is in a 1-for-22 slump, followed
closely by Chipper Jones at 1-for-20.

   NEW YORK _ Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. said Monday that it
planned to sell to the public as much as 20 percent of its American
film, television and sports businesses _ including 20th Century
Fox, Fox Television and the Los Angeles Dodgers _ in an initial
stock offering. The sale is aimed in large part at bolstering the
price of News Corp.'s shares, which have lagged behind those of
other media giants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Murdoch is putting a window on some of the more developing
assets that may not earn very much but undoubtedly will have
considerable growth,'' said David Londoner, an analyst with
Schroder &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   A sale could also help News Corp. pay down some of its $8
billion in debt. And it would give the company a new stock that it
could use to make acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to say how much 20 percent in the new company,
Fox Group, would be worth, analysts said, because the amount of
debt it would carry is not known. The businesses that make up the
Fox Group accounted for nearly $7 billion of News Corp.'s $11.2
billion in U.S. revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were enthusiastic about the planned offering, sending
the American depository receipts of News Corp. up 12 percent. The
ADRs _ each representing four shares of the Australian company _
closed up $3.5625, at $33.0625, after earlier touching a 52-week
high of $33.25.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp. ADRs have been trading at about eight times cash
flow, compared with rivals Time Warner, Viacom and Walt Disney, for
example, which are trading at roughly 12 times cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's caution over News Corp. stems largely from the
fact that the company, which also owns HarperCollins, The New York
Post and newspapers in Britain and Australia, is seen as a
publishing and newspaper company as much as an entertainment
company, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is up 40 percent over the past 18 months, but that compares
badly with Time Warner at 127 percent and Viacom at 73 percent,''
said Ed Hatch of UBS Securities. ``This will let investors directly
own News Corp.'s fastest-growing and most highly valued businesses
and remind investors that News Corp. owns 80 percent of those
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The market for new stock issues has cooled in the last month.
Still, News Corp.'s sale is expected by the end of the year, when
investors could be more receptive. More important, the move follows
several years of debt-paring by the company and could set the stage
for more acquisitions. Earlier this month, News Corp. sold TV
Guide, one of the crown jewels of its 1980s buying spree, for $2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lyon, president of Institutional Capital, which manages
$12 billion and owns News Corp. preferred stock, noted that an
advantage of the Fox Group offering is that it frees News Corp. to
use the new stock for acquisitions. Analysts expect that the new
stock will trade at a higher multiple, and if that proves the case,
it would be a cheaper currency for making acquisitions. Moreover,
they note, Murdoch has always been an empire builder.
</P>
<P>
   And because News Corp. is selling only 20 percent to the public,
it will continue to be able to consolidate the Fox Group's profits
or losses at the parent company for tax purposes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As part of the deal, News Corp. is keeping its largest
money-loser _ Star-TV, its Asian cable-programming service _ at the
parent company. That operation is believed to have lost about $80
million in fiscal 1998, which ends Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Its more recent start-up operation, Fox News, which is still
losing money _ about $75 million a year, by Lyon's estimate _ will
be part of the new venture, along with Fox's 50 percent stake in a
host of regional sports services.
</P>
<P>
   Investors do not know the full value of the sports networks
because they are part of a joint venture that is 50 percent owned
by Liberty Media, a cable-programming company. Neither parent
reports the joint-venture numbers separately from other operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Hatch estimates that the film studio, the television
production company and the 22 television stations are likely to
have 1999 cash flow of about $1 billion. If the company does trade
at a 12 multiple, like other media companies, 20 percent of that
would be $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's recent record has been stamped by the huge
success of ``Titanic,'' the $200 million budget for which was
financed by Fox and Paramount, which put in $65 million. So far the
film has grossed over $1 billion worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Its new release, ``Dr. Doolittle,'' opened unexpectedly strong
over the weekend, taking in $29 million at the box office.
``Bulworth'' was a disappointment, but ``Hope Floats'' and ``The X
Files'' have been somewhat successful. Still, forecasting cash flow
from the unpredictable film business is always difficult.

 &HT;    Poll shows most Americans believe in possibilities of UFO'sBy
Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    (EDS: Corrects to 'Ball Lightening' in 6th graph.)
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Walter Sheets, a former police chief College Park,
Ga., saw his first UFO in the mid-'60s and has seen a slew since
then. He welcomes a new call by a distinguished group of scientists
for more research on whether space aliens have ever visited earth.
</P>
<P>
   So does Michael Hitt, a Roswell, Ga. police officer, who has
also seen some UFOs. He says the scientists' conclusion, that many
UFO sightings have never been adequately explained, is not only
obvious, but long overdue.
</P>
<P>
   If Sheets and Hit are kooks, they have a lot of company. Most of
the American public would likely agree with them, according to the
latest Southern Focus poll by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The poll found that 59 percent of Southerners and 66 percent of
people outside the South think UFOs are real, or at least could be.
The poll also found that 53 percent of Southerners and 62 percent
of people outside the region think it's at least possible that
aliens have visited Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The scientific panel, which conducted the first independent
scholarly review of UFOs in nearly three decades, published its
50-page report Monday. It argued that more research is needed
because many strange phenomena have been pooh-poohed too quickly.
It cited mysterious objects on radar, strange lights flitting in
the skies, aberrations in the workings of automobiles, skin burns
of witnesses and radiation found in vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, headed by Stanford University physicist Peter
Sturrock and made up of scientists from other major universities,
chided scholars worldwide for shying away from UFO research because
of the potential for ridicule. It noted that meteorites and ball
lighting (a rare phenomenon) were ``originally dismissed as folk
tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheets and Hitt said this new recommendation will spark
increased enthusiasm for a scheduled ``sky watch'' after dusk on
July 11, at which dozens of Georgians are expected to converge on a
``UFO hot spot'' in Troup County, Ga. The event is sponsored by the
Georgia chapter of the Mutual UFO Network, of which both men are
members.
</P>
<P>
   Hitt, 42, MUFON's state historian, said thousands of UFOs have
been sighted in Georgia. He said ``hot spots'' change every few
years and that Atlanta and military facilities in Georgia have all
been areas of alien scrutiny over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Faded Journal-Constitution archives show ``flying saucers'' have
been the subject of dozens of serious news reports since World War
II. In 1952, for example, the Constitution published a United Press
International story reporting that the U.S. military had ordered
jet pilots to take off instantly in pursuit of ``flying saucers''
reported anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, a story in the Journal, quoting officials of the North
American Defense Command, reported that it was ``very unlikely''
that a flock of UFOs sighted over Georgia could be explained away
as space junk falling to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force last year made public what it said would be its
last report on UFOs. It explained that the famous ``Roswell (N.M.)
incident'' of 1947, thought by many to be a UFO crash, was a
military experiment with high-altitude parachuting, involving
dummies. Earlier, the Pentagon launched Project Blue Book in 1952
to investigate thousands of UFO sightings and ended the research in
1969, concluding it had found no useful evidence any unexplained
phenomena constituted a security risk.
</P>
<P>
   Sheets, 49, a Vietnam combat veteran who spent 25 years as a
homicide detective before becoming police chief in College Park,
argues that Washington wants to sweep UFOs under the rug because it
fears ``if mankind were to learn about another intelligence from
elsewhere, there would be chaos in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he personally has investigated hundreds of sightings. He
said he saw his first UFO as a student in the 1960s, peering
through a telescope. He saw a ``V-shaped formation of disc-like
craft, traveling east to west, high in the sky, performing unusual
and bizarre aerial maneuvers.''
</P>
<P>
   He said many sightings are made by police officers, who often
are reluctant to tell their superiors for fear of being labeled
kooks.
</P>
<P>
   Hitt said he saw his first UFO in 1969 when he took his family
to Florida to watch an Apollo moon launch. The night before
blastoff, he said, ``we saw something that looked like a shooting
star, streaking across. But then it stopped, and reversed its
course, and did this zigzag pattern for 15 seconds. I knew no one
would believe me, so I got my sister, mother and grandmother to
look, and they all saw it. It was very rapid.''
</P>
<P>
   As Georgia's historian of MUFON, a well-organized national
organization with its own web sites, he said he feels UFOs have
been visiting Earth for eons but started coming more often after
atomic bomb detonations started in 1945. He said it is ``well
documented'' that Dobbins Air Force base in Marietta, Ga. was
``buzzed'' by UFOs in 1952, the same year strange objects were
reported streaking over the White House by Washington newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   John Thompson, a 45-year-old LaGrange, Ga. insurance executive
and a past state director of MUFON, said he and his family _ wife
and three sons _ saw a UFO on Feb. 20, 1994, that had to be from
out of this world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like a string of bright, non-blinking Christmas tree
lights, just sitting in the sky, low on the horizon. It had a large
white light in the center, and it was revolving.''
</P>
<P>
   By arguing that UFOs definitely do exist, the MUFON men go far
beyond the new report, which only suggests more study. Many other
academics ridicule the very idea of UFOs, and say that the only
research needed is psychological: to determine why people believe.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Sparks, an expert on belief systems at Purdue University,
said his research shows that angst over the coming of a new
millennium, fed by Hollywood movies and TV shows, is fueling belief
in UFOs and other kinds of unproven phenomena, like ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to want to believe,'' he said. ``It's a general
way of coping with upheaval in society.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Murphy, an anthropologist at the University of Alabama,
said ``there is absolutely no archaeological evidence for UFOs,
though it would be irrational to think that in an infinite
universe, there is not other life. But it's just as irrational to
think that any of that alien life could have found Earth and would
be interested in us if they did, unless they were entomologists and
wanted to study us like bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Terry Sandbek, a clinical psychologist in California who
also specializes in behavior, said the reason people believe in
UFOs is simple: ``It's the same reason we enjoy fiction,'' he said.
``It's fun.

CLINTON SEES CHINA'S ECONOMIC FUTURE IN SHANGHAI 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Midway through his nine-day journey, President
Clinton ventured Tuesday into China's financial capital to view
first hand the rapid economic changes in this nation's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his entourage of 1,000 left Beijing Monday night
after a series of historic sessions with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin and the unprecedented live broadcast of his address to Peking
University students.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials touted the president's speech and a
series of economic agreements as proof that a new relationship
between the United States and China was well underway.
</P>
<P>
   No where is the new China on better display that in this city of
13 million where entrepreneurs are becoming millionaires as this
communist country turns toward a more market-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways, Shanghai is the future of China because of the
changes that are taking place in China are reflected in the very
dynamic growth, economically, and the changes occurring in South
China,'' said White House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said the president ``will see that and literally be a
part of that over the coming days.'' Clinton's visit mirrors
Jiang's visit to the United States last October when he visited New
York and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was to tour the Shanghai Library and meet with local
community leaders to discuss the shaping of China for the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   The new Shanghai Library houses more than 1 million volumes and
contains the latest technology, including Internet access. The tour
and discussion afterward will help Clinton underscore a major
message here: that the new information age will require China to
have a more open society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, touring the library is an opportunity for him to
make vivid the argument he made today, that information
technologies and the flow of information will inevitably produce
change in China. And touring the library will be a dramatic part of
that,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   During Clinton's two-day stay here, he will appear on a radio
talk show and take questions from callers as well as meet with U.S.
business executives and Shanghai's young entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the size of Clinton's entourage, the delegation contains
no business executives, who usually make up a portion of the group
accompanying the president. Clinton already is under fire from
critics for emphasizing trade over human rights and from
Republicans who accuse him of altering U.S. export policy to China
to benefit a business executive who contributed money to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   However, McCurry said a business delegation was not as critical
as it was when Clinton toured Africa earlier this year. ``This is
not a case of the president needing to bring business with him to
China; they are literally already here, and they're interested in
what we can do to further the relationship and to be of
assistance,'' McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials were thrilled by China's decision to air
Clinton's remarks to Peking University students live on television
and radio. The live broadcast followed a similar decision to air a
news conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what it is is evidence of the way in which the
president's policy has worked and has been successful in terms of
engagement,'' said Sandy Kristoff, the Asian affairs expert at the
National Security Council. ``What engagement really means is that
you can work through your differences, continue to agree to
disagree and continue to fight, not pull any punches, and at the
same time, produce results and cooperate in areas where you do have
shared interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Shirk, deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asia,
said it would not be possible for China to bury the controversial
subjects of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre nor the issue of
Tibet following the Clinton-Jiang news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, as to what happens next, we don't know. I don't think it
would be wise to say this opens up a whole new era in China, but it
was a very self-conscious decision on President Jiang's part to
allow this kind of open discussion on previously taboo ideas,''
Shirk said.
</P>
<P>
   The administration also touted a series of agreements, such as
opening China to Peace Corps volunteers and initiating new programs
to help China strengthen its legal system.
</P>
<P>
   The domestic controversy in the United States caused by
Clinton's decision to allow U.S. companies to use Chinese rockets
to launch satellites also is reverberating here. Critics contend
Loral Space &AMP; Communications Ltd., owned by a major Clinton backer,
illegally passed on missile information that allowed China to
improve its rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been an urgency for us to tell the Chinese we need to
talk to them, we need to engage them and talk about these issues.
The tack we've been taking with the Chinese is that it is very
important that we have transparency and dialogue in our
relationship, so that we can work together to clear up
misunderstandings and provide information to the people in the
United States who have concerns about these issues,'' said Alan
Turley, a commercial affairs expert based at the U.S. Embassy in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the openness displayed during the president's visit,
Chinese police continued their close watch on dissidents, detaining
yet another democracy activist who was attempting to set up an
opposition political party. It was the sixth dissident rounded up
during President Clinton's visit.

KNICKS LOOKING FOR TRADE OPPORTUNITIES BEFORE LOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Knicks were still talking to teams about making a
trade before Tuesday night's midnight deadline while waiting for
the Charles Oakley trade to become official.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley was traded to Toronto for Marcus Camby last Wednesday. To
complete the deal, Oakley was supposed to arrive in Toronto for his
physical Monday at noon, but he was not on his scheduled flight.
One league official said the deadline for Oakley to report was
extended to 5 p.m. Tuesday. If Oakley fails to show up, according
to the league official, the Raptors have to either void the deal or
waive the physical for the 34-year-old forward.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Raptors and Knicks said they expected Oakley
to arrive and pass his physical, clearing the way for the deal to
go through before the league's lockout is scheduled to begin at
midnight Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, all player-related business between teams will
cease. That leaves the Knicks with a small window of time to
complete a deal for a point guard. As of Monday, there was no trade
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything can pop up,'' the team president, Ernie Grunfeld,
said. ``But in all likelihood, this is what we have.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks have shown interest in Milwaukee's Terrell Brandon,
the former Laker Nick Van Exel and the former Sun Steve Nash.
However, Van Exel was traded to the Nuggets and Vancouver acquired
Nash last week, and their new teams appear eager to hold on to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon is still a possibility. But a deal for him would be a
better salary-cap fit for both teams after the lockout ends and
players are under next year's salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Once Brandon's balloon payment of $7 million for next year kicks
in, the Bucks, if they are under the salary cap, would be able to
take back multiple players in a deal. In such a scenario, the
Knicks could send Milwaukee Chris Childs, John Starks and Chris
Mills. Under his current pre-July 1 salary, Brandon, a base-year
compensation player, makes just $1.6 million. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republican politicians and strategists
say they are troubled by a wave of harsh anti-homosexual oratory
from fellow Republicans, fearing it could make the party appear
intolerant and drive out moderates and economic conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns are not limited to moderate Republicans. Many
conservatives said the recent attacks on homosexuality by party
leaders, candidates and local Republican officials could spur a
reprise of the 1992 presidential campaign, when intramural
skirmishes over issues like abortion turned off the wider
electorate in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans said the blunt comments, notably those made
in a recent interview by Sen. Trent Lott, R.-Miss., stemmed from a
determination among some in the party to score points with the
right wing and energize hard-core Republican voters. Lott, the
Republican leader, had likened homosexuality to kleptomania,
alcoholism and sex addiction.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans condemned the attacks as short-sighted.
``The Republican Party has tripped over its own shoelaces and found
itself on the defensive,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican strategist
and former head of the Christian Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., took issue with his colleagues
who contend that such statements ``might energize the party.'' He
said, ``I don't believe the party is likely to grow stronger or our
voters more numerous through attacks on minorities, whether they be
sexual minorities or religious or racial minorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Most accept that the remarks by Lott and Rep. Dick Armey,
R-Texas, the majority leader, and many others reflect their genuine
belief that homosexuality is a sin. What has changed is that there
now is greater willingness among Republicans to speak bluntly
instead of couching their beliefs in politically agreeable
language.
</P>
<P>
   The shift appears to have been spurred by conservative leaders,
notably Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council and Dr. James
Dobson of the ``Focus on the Family'' radio talk show. The two are
pressing lawmakers to emphasize their opposition to homosexuality
as part of a social-issues agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a demand from some quarters that we aggressively
attack the homosexual community,'' said Rep. Joe Scarborough,
R-Fla., one of the most conservative House members. While he said
the comments make some Republicans look like ``strident, right-wing
cartoon characters,'' Scarborough added, ``There's not a real
political downside right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Scarborough, who is 35, said his position on gay rights was
probably not much different from Lott's or others who have spoken
out. Yet he suggested there was a generational difference, and that
younger people like himself were more careful about their language
because ``we have all had friends who are gay and understand that
they are not the demons that they're made out to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although some Republicans conceded that their party could not
expect wide support from gay rights advocates, they said their
biggest worry would be that the comments would offend so-called
swing voters in the suburbs who are not particularly loyal to one
party or another.

   John McLaughlin, a Republican pollster, said his surveys show
the attacks on homosexuality offend voters even in the most
conservative parts of the South. ``In a lot of areas, this is not a
threat to their values and their hometowns and their communities,''
he said of homosexuals. But by raising the issue, he said, ``it
makes Republicans look out of touch, like they care about things
the voters don't care about.''
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin said his polling also found that the anti-gay oratory
``makes Republicans look mean-spirited. Ronald Reagan may have been
``anti-gay,'' he said, ``but he wasn't somebody who disliked
people.''
</P>
<P>
   William Pascoe III, political director of the American
Conservative Union, also said the anti-gay oratory would benefit
Republicans. ``Anytime you have Republican leaders citing the Bible
as the foundation for their beliefs,'' he said, ``as opposed to
Democratic leaders citing the American Psychiatric Association, I
think we win.''
</P>
<P>
   But many Republicans condemned the attacks as short-sighted.
``The Republican Party has tripped over its own shoe laces and
found itself on the defensive,'' said Ralph Reed, a Republican
strategist and the former executive director of the Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In his former position, Reed was careful not to attack
homosexuals directly but instead capitalized on the issue by using
code words like the coalition's belief in the ``sanctity of
marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The risk that Reed and other Republicans spoke of could not be
quantified. But they said they feared that the blunt comments could
cost the party not only moderates who favor homosexual rights but
quite conservative Republicans who might consider attacks on
homosexuals mean-spirited or inappropriate for a party that should
concern itself with more pressing legislative matters.
</P>
<P>
   While leading Republicans insisted that there was no
orchestrated drive in the party to go after homosexuals, there has
been a drumbeat of criticism in recent days. The most notable came
from Lott. His supporters said his remarks helped him with
conservatives who were furious when he criticized the Air Force
last year for ousting 1st Lt. Kelly Flinn on charges relating to
from adultery.
</P>
<P>
   Several conservatives said comments in support of Lott by Armey,
who wants to succeed Newt Gingrich as speaker, were intended to
help him win favor with conservative House members who believe he
has not been honest in acknowledging his role in the failed coup
attempt against Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bible is very clear on this,'' Armey said, adding that
``both myself and Senator Lott believe very strongly in the
Bible.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published on Monday, Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, a longtime foe of homosexuals, stepped up his criticism.
``They start by pretending that it is just another form of love,''
he told Congressional Quarterly. ``It's sickening.'' Helms was
responding to a new documentary that criticizes his treatment of
homosexuals.

</P>
<P>
   Asked about comments such as Lott's, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.,
said, ``I don't believe in discrimination of any kind.'' He said
the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization, ``should be part of
our party.''
</P>
<P>
   The tensions are reminiscent of the 1996 presidential contest,
when Bob Dole's campaign was thrown into turmoil when it returned a
contribution from the Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican Party, said the
denunciations of homosexuality could be politically beneficial
because ``when people are honest about their views most people
respect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said of the comments: ``I'm not concerned about what
any of those leaders have said. I agree with them. I don't know
that we fully understand very much about the sources of
homosexuality or if there is a way to alter that. I've talked to
some people in both the scientific and theological communities, and
they don't seem to be very clear about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Republican leaders in Texas barred the Log
Cabin Republicans from setting up a booth at the party's state
convention. Robert Black, a party spokesman, inflamed the issue
when he likened the group to the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, who is weighing a bid for
President in 2000, won praise from Reed and other Republicans by
trying to tamp down the oratory from the state party. A statement
issued by his office said, ``Gov. Bush believes all individuals
deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. While he differs
with the Log Cabin Republicans on issues such as gay marriage, he
does not condone name calling.''
</P>
<P>
   That same weekend, at a gathering of Republican presidential
aspirants in Iowa, Bauer appeared with Reggie White, the Green Bay
Packers star who had called homosexuality ``one of the biggest sins
in the Bible.'' And another prospective contender, Steve Forbes,
appeared with the Rev. Louis Sheldon, a vociferous critic of
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer said he spoke briefly with Lott after he made his comments
_ and he expressed no regrets. ``I told him to hang in there,''
Bauer recalled. ``But he was feeling OK. Apparently he got a lot of
phone calls from people saying that they admired his courage.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate continues among Republicans, this much is clear:
Lott no longer wants to talk about homosexuals. Asked about his
remarks, he replied, ``I think enough has probably already been
said about that.'' He then stuck out his tongue and sputtered into
a reporter's tape recorder.

DODGERS BRUISED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Tex. _ Gary Sheffield emerged from the pile Sunday
night bloody and defiant. That was the problem.
</P>
<P>
   His fight with Pittsburgh's Jason Kendall in the sixth inning
and the Dodgers leading by three runs was not a call to arms. It
was an massive error in judgment that reaches far beyond the
Pirates' eventual comeback victory.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of heading on the road hoping to put behind six weeks of
chaos, the Dodgers dragged Sunday along with them. And the mess
didn't just stop at Sheffield. Eric Karros, Wilton Guerrero, Adrian
Beltre, Roger Cedeno and manager Glenn Hoffman all sat at the table
of baseball's most dysfunctional family. And it is certain to get
worse before it gets better.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield set the tone when he went after Kendall, the Pirates'
best player. First he knocked off Kendall's helmet during a near
collision at home plate, then didn't like what the catcher had to
say.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield already had a two-run homer, an RBI single and his
foot on the neck of the Pirates, who were 10 outs from getting
swept in a three-game series. Why he didn't walk away and let the
team move onto Texas feeling good is a strange call for the
Dodgers' best player.
</P>
<P>
   Victories bring their own swagger. Going after the only name on
the other team doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that Kendall is a hothead who has had run-ins
with other top players. It also could be said that last season's
brawl with the Angels after Chan Ho park hit Tony Phillips helped
ignite the Dodgers and get them back in the race. But emotionally
that team was like the '27 Yankees compared to this one. Walk away.
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield has been the most productive Dodger on the field since
the May 15 Mike Piazza trade. Off the field he has been even
better.
</P>
<P>
   There are children's groups and scholarships that seldom get
mentioned. But Dodgers fans didn't get a World Series ring like he
did last year in Florida. They just want him to help the team win.
</P>
<P>
   After the lowly Pirates rallied with five runs in the final
three innings, everybody in the visiting clubhouse huddled around a
tiny television, looking for clues to the mayhem. More than the
punches thrown, they wanted to see what made the Dodgers come
unglued.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheffield/Kendall play began when Cedeno was picked off
first base by reliever Mike Williams. The Pirates pulled one of
those fake-to-third, throw-to-first plays that never work. Scouting
reports all over baseball are being rewritten. Cedeno, who the
Dodgers projected as their Opening Day center fielder, has been
responsible for a half dozen blunders this season. He has dropped
fly balls, tried to take third on ground balls to short and been
picked off in critical situations.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno had a nice little six-game hitting streak, but he is not
the answer, except for maybe some bad Dodgers trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the Sheffield play, Karros set another bad tone.
Some might say he had good reason. But when the team is 39-42,
saving a season should be all that matters. Karros came in batting
.385 during a 10-game hitting streak. More important, he was
batting .345 with runners in scoring position during the streak and
.311 since returning to the cleanup spot.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy who had three consecutive 30-homer, 100-RBI
seasons batting fourth. Sunday, he was dropped to fifth behind
Sheffield after the team had just won two straight.
</P>
<P>
   Karros, who rehabs his left knee for hours before and after
games, wasn't around to talk about the move. He didn't have to. His
slumping body language said it all. The move was very questionable,
but Karros needed to show the kids he is on board.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of kids, Beltre no longer looks like the player who had
an RBI single on the first pitch he faced in the big leagues. He
looks like what he is, a Double-A third baseman with great
potential. Beltre is bright and composed. He also is 3 for 19 at
the plate and threw away a ground ball that led to the eventual
winning run.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems like picking on the Latin youngsters, nothing
could be further from the truth. Management needs to put them in
situations to succeed, not rush them into situations where they
can't help.
</P>
<P>
   It probably won't be the first time Hoffman is second-guessed as
a manager, having Guerrero at shortstop in the ninth inning when
the Dodgers had a chance to stop the mess.
</P>
<P>
   During Ismael Valdes' near perfect game on Saturday, Hoffman put
Juan Castro at short in the late innings. Sunday, he stayed with
Guerrero, who is a gifted hitter but moved from short to second
because of defensive problems. Now he was back at short and booted
Tony Womack's grounder that led to the Pirates final run.
</P>
<P>
   Just one game. But oh, what a story it told.

PROSECUTOR CALLS KING A LIAR WHO DEFRAUDED AN INSURER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal prosecutor described Don King on Monday as
a liar who fraudulently collected $350,000 in insurance after a
1991 fight was canceled and then repeatedly deceived the boxer
Julio Cesar Chavez to perpetuate the scam.
</P>
<P>
   In closing arguments in U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
Christine Chung, an assistant U.S. attorney, told the jury that
King ``had the motive, means and opportunity'' to submit a phony
contract to a Lloyd's of London syndicate calling for repayment of
$350,000 in training expenses to Chavez, to backdate a $30,000
check to Chavez after the cancellation, to direct accountants to
file a fraudulent claim and to not pay Chavez when Lloyd's paid the
claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may have had help, but Don King did it,'' Chung said in her
three-and-a-half-hour summation. ``When you intersect all the lines
of proof, only one man is standing _ Don King.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 trial in the case ended in a mistrial. King was the only
defendant then; this time King and his company, Don King
Productions, were indicted on nine charges of wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Citing King's testimony in the 1995 trial, Chung said, ``He took
the stand and told lies, about things big and small.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Fleming Jr., one of King's lawyers, said in his closing
argument: ``I heard in the last five minutes the word `lie' as many
as 15 times. Do you see a single count of perjury against Don
King?''
</P>
<P>
   In his two-hour summation, Fleming tried to distance King from
any wrongdoing. ``In 1991, Don King Productions had revenues of $61
million,'' he said. ``And Mr. King is running around trying to
defraud Syndicate 370 of $350,000? Where lies the fraud? In the
United States? In London?''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming criticized the prosecution for hiding crucial facts from
the jury, which he said he had to bring out in cross-examination;
excoriated the testimony of government witnesses like Joseph
Maffia, King's former accountant and chief accuser, who was granted
immunity; and belittled insurance officials for giving depositions
on videotape in London but refusing to testify in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming also argued that the prosecution misinterpreted the
phrase ``maintenance non-refundable training expenses.'' The
prosecution contends that the $350,000 in expenses that the Lloyd's
syndicate reimbursed did not exist. Fleming said it consisted of
$80,000 paid in two checks to Chavez (which, he said, King took as
a loss) and $270,000 in what he called maintenance, to pay off
$736,000 that King had advanced Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming never addressed the prosecution's accusation that King,
or his company, submitted a phony contract to the Lloyd's
syndicate, one that Chavez did not sign, with the rider calling for
payment to Chavez of the $350,000 in non-refundable expenses.
Instead, Fleming asked, ``Is it a crime that the insurance company
wasn't told that the contract was modified?''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming continued, ``They want to convict because the insurance
company wasn't told this wasn't the original contract Chavez
signed.''
</P>
<P>
   King continued to look at ease, reading during the session and
greeting courtroom guests. During breaks, his roaring laugh was
easily heard. Among his supporters Monday were former Mayor David
Dinkins and Rabbi Shea Hecht, the chairman of the National
Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education. Hecht
distributed fliers announcing a dinner in November at which King
would be honored with the committee's humanitarian award.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming was scheduled to finish his statement Tuesday morning,
and then Billy Murphy Jr. would give a summation for Don King
Productions. Baruch Weiss, a second prosecutor, was to deliver the
rebuttal argument.
</P>
<P>
   The jury could begin deliberations Wednesday. &QL;

POWERGEN TO BUY UTILITY FOR $1.4 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Powergen PLC, Britain's second-largest generator of electricity,
said Monday that it had agreed to buy East Midlands Electricity for
$1.4 billion in cash.
</P>
<P>
   East Midlands, one of 12 regional distributors and sellers of
electricity in England and Wales, is being sold by Dominion
Resources Inc., an American utility company, which said it had been
frustrated in its attempts to grow in Britain, even though the
utility industry is being deregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Dominion bought Midland, which serves 2.3 million mostly
residential customers, in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   For Powergen, the acquisition, which also includes the
assumption of $1.8 billion in debt, will help it achieve its goal
of integrating its power business with a distributor. The British
government separated the businesses when it privatized electricity
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of Powergen, Edmund Wallis, has said that his
company is looking for an acquisition in the United States.
Industry executives said Monday that Powergen had been in talks
with Houston Industries, a major utility, over a possible merger.
Such a combination would be one of the largest ever in the industry
and the first where a British company was an equal partner.

 &HT;    Ohio man faces music to unusual protesting
 &HT;    By Jennifer Inez Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Carl E. Lenhof, accused of defecating in books at
Miami (Ohio) Valley public libraries will have to pay more than
$500 for the damage and will likely lose his library card.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Lenhof pleaded no contest in Dayton Municipal Court
to two counts of criminal damaging and one count of telephone
harassment. He must pay $518 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 known cases of vandalism centered on books dealing with
homosexuality, the United Nations and the Federal Reserve. The
books were found in the men's toilet or in the book return area in
Dayton, as well as neighboring Kettering, Huber Heights, West
Carrollton, Centerville and Englewood, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dayton's Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, where
Lenhof works as an electrical engineer, said Monday, ``appropriate
action'' will be taken against Lenhof,'' but officials declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Greene County Public Library officials said the Yellow Springs
and Beavercreek branches were hit by the vandalism in 1997. Three
books relating to homosexuality were damaged. Officials said they
would seek restitution but not charges.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting Lenhof's plea, Dayton Municipal Judge Bill Littlejohn
said, ``I certainly think he should not go to the library.'' A
sentencing date has not been set. Lenhof faces up to six months in
jail for each count.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton police Detective Dan Hall said the vandalism happened at
libraries between 1994 and1997.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Lenhof nor his attorney, Larry Greger would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Lenhof has worked at the base since 1970. He also owns Verita's
Catholic Books on Burkhardt Road.
</P>
<P>
   Lenhof, 49, of Riverside was originally charged with four counts
of criminal damaging and one count of telephone harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the plea, other municipalities in Montgomery
County will not prosecute him.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Lenhof made harassing phone calls to the Dayton
Lesbian and Gay Center and the Dayton chapter of the National
Organization for Women.

 &HT;    Transportation bill brings extra money to Texas
 &HT;    By Debbie Hiott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Hoping an early start will mean more highway
money for Texas, state and local leaders vowed Monday to begin
angling for part of $700 million set aside in a national
transportation bill for border infrastructure and trade corridors.
</P>
<P>
   That money comes on top of the $1.9 billion per year the state
already expects for highways in the new six-year bill.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm, in Austin as part of a three-city tour to
discuss state highway needs, urged state leaders to begin pursuing
the trade corridor money.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to be successful, we're going to have to do our
homework,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Highway Administrator Ken Wykle said the federal call
for projects will come in the fall. In the Central Texas region,
transportation planners are likely to ask for trade corridor money
to build Texas 130, the 89-mile proposed Interstate 35 alternate
that would run from Interstate 10 in Seguin to I-35 just north of
Georgetown. Supporters say the highway is needed to relieve
congestion on I-35, where traffic has increased 25 percent since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes the drive through Austin one of the busiest
stretches of I-35,'' said Austin Mayor Kirk Watson. ``It is nothing
to brag about when it means we've got more traffic, bigger
congestion and more deaths than any other stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas 130 is expected to cost $1 billion, and although
transportation planners have said it will be a toll road, tolls are
expected to pay only 40 percent of the cost. It will be five to 10
years before it is built.
</P>
<P>
   Although the project has received widespread support from
Central Texas politicians and business leaders, not everyone thinks
Texas 130 will solve traffic problems. While about 200 Texas 130
boosters listened to Watson and Gramm in the state Transportation
Department headquarters, about two dozen people outside protested
the project.
</P>
<P>
   Karin Ascot of Commuter Choices Coalition, a group formed to
opposeTexas 130, said it would rather see the $1 billion spent on
passenger rail, a better bus system and other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to create sprawl,'' she said. She said Texas 130
won't reduce traffic on I-35 or solve traffic problems created by
the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   According to a study by state consultants, Texas 130 would
relieve I-35 traffic by 6 to 8 percent downtown. In Williamson
County it would reduce I-35 traffic more than 20 percent. The state
has not said how much Texas 130 would relieve I-35 traffic as a
toll road.
</P>
<P>
   The highway is expected to be built in phases, with the first
phase extending from just north of Georgetown to U.S. 290 east. A
second phase would go through the rest of Travis County, and a
final phase would extend to Seguin.

   Opponents say the highway will be most convenient for Williamson
County residents and will encourage suburban sprawl instead of
Austin's Smart Growth initiative, which seeks to steer growth to
less environmentally sensitive areas. But Watson said Texas 130
will help promote Smart Growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we need to do in order to have Smart Growth
is we need to have infrastructure in the area where you want growth
to occur,'' he said. Watson said Texas 130 will help direct more
growth to the less developed east side of Austin.

 By ELIZABETH BUMILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a hot July day in 1848, a frustrated upstate New York
housewife named Elizabeth Cady Stanton assembled a convention in a
Seneca Falls church and made the radical demand that women be
allowed to vote. In that moment, she changed not only American
history but the expectations placed on the next five generations of
women in her own family.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this matrilineal line of descent: Stanton's daughter,
Harriot Blatch, became the chief strategist of the suffrage
movement in New York. Harriot Blatch's daughter, Nora Barney, was
one of the first women to become a civil engineer. Mrs. Barney's
daughter, Rhoda Jenkins, 77, became an architect. Her daughter,
Coline Jenkins-Sahlin, 46, is an elected official in Greenwich,
Conn., and last year helped move a long-forgotten statue of
Stanton, Susan B. Anthony and Lucretia Mott to the U.S. Capitol
Rotunda. Ms. Jenkins-Sahlin's daughter, Elizabeth, 13, has
contributed a chapter about six generations of Stantons in ``33
Things Every Girl Should Know,'' a book for young women published
this year by Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, Elizabeth, her mother and grandmother will be among
the descendants of the 1848 participants to celebrate the
convention's 150th anniversary in Seneca Falls. Hillary Rodham
Clinton is to open four days of events with a speech on July 16.
The National Park Service will promote the Women's Rights National
Historical Park in Seneca Falls, and the National Organization for
Women will be there to advance its agenda.
</P>
<P>
   But for Elizabeth, her mother and grandmother, the anniversary
is as personal as it is political _ a family reunion under the gaze
of the ``Queenmother,'' as Stanton was called in her old age. On a
recent day in Old Greenwich, at the home of Ms. Jenkins-Sahlin,
they talked about a legacy that both liberated and oppressed, about
complicated mother-daughter relationships, and about a little-known
family history that is also America's.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like to know that I'm a descendant,'' Ms.
Jenkins-Sahlin said. ``And if that's meaningful to them, if that's
a means for them to connect to women's history, I will gladly serve
that role. A lot of America does not know it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three, Rhoda Jenkins, Stanton's great-granddaughter, has
borne the most weight from the past. She is closest to it, of
course, and also may have had the most difficult mother, at least
from her point of view. ``Either you got out of her way, or you
suffered,'' Ms. Jenkins said of her mother, Nora Barney. As for the
specter of her foremothers, she said: ``It was always there. You
had to do your best, you had to be responsible, you had to be
independent. And on and on and on. It was a heavy burden to
carry.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Ms. Jenkins said she would not have become an architect
without the strong women behind her. ``Mother believed in
pushing,'' she said. ``You don't question a hurricane.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jenkins was born in July 1920, 18 years after the death of
Stanton, but only a month before the passage of the 19th Amendment
giving women the vote. She grew up in Greenwich, where her mother
designed and built 25 houses. (Ms. Jenkins' father, Morgan Barney,
was a naval architect.) There was a nanny, a governess and a
realization only in Ms. Jenkins' later years that her mother had
been unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always could rely on her to back me up on anything,'' Ms.
Jenkins said. ``But we really didn't have those cozy times that I
read about that other girls had.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhoda Jenkins graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in
1941 with an architecture degree, worked with her brother building
houses in Greenwich, then married Frederick Jenkins, a landscape
architect, in 1948. She continued working after her children were
born _ a son, Morgan, in 1949 and Coline in 1951. When her husband
died of lung cancer in 1955, Ms. Jenkins struggled.
</P>
<P>
   One of the last things on her mind was women's rights. ``I
didn't really have much time,'' she said. She did not join NOW
until she was in her 70s.
</P>
<P>
   She was determined to rear her daughter in a different way than
her mother had reared her. ``I made an effort not to say, `You've
got to do this,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Coline, agrees that ``she didn't dominate me.'' At
the same time, she heard very little from her mother about her
history until the family started making trips to Seneca Falls, when
Ms. Jenkins-Sahlin was 18. ``But I had these very strong women
around me,'' Ms. Jenkins-Sahlin said. ``Those were my role models.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jenkins-Sahlin went to public schools in Rye, N.Y., and
graduated from Earlham College in Richmond, Ind., in 1973, well
into the second wave of the women's movement.
</P>
<P>
   She married Gunnar Sahlin, a cellist with the Stockholm
Philharmonic, in 1976, and for the next 12 years lived in Sweden,
where Elizabeth and her brother, Eric, were born.
</P>
<P>
   After the family moved to America in 1988, she became president
of a park preservation group and was elected to Greenwich's
legislative body.
</P>
<P>
   One of her first acts was a resolution that made the language of
the Greenwich government sex-neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found it unacceptable that a government body can only talk
about `he,''' Ms. Jenkins-Sahlin said. Although her foremothers
would have cheered her on, she said she acted on her own. ``I don't
feel any pressure from them,'' she said. ``But I would love to meet
them. Wouldn't it be great if they could be right here?''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ms. Jenkins-Sahlin has helped found Third Wave
Television, a production company that makes programs on women's
issues. She is also offering her daughter more information on the
family past than she was given _ not least because women's history
is more available now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want her to know things,'' Ms. Jenkins-Sahlin said. ``But I
don't want to push it on her so that she's turned off by it.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems unlikely. ``What they did was very heroic,''
Elizabeth said of her foremothers. ``They went against everything
that was typical of the time.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elizabeth will be in the ninth grade at Greenwich High School
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   She would like to be an architect or an engineer, like her
grandmother and great-grandmother. ``Anything's possible for
anyone,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And what would Elizabeth Cady Stanton _ who did not live to see
suffrage _ think of the lives of American women today?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that she would be pretty delighted,'' said Ms.
Jenkins, her great-granddaughter, marveling at the inroads women
have made into fields dominated by men. ``I'm amazed myself.''

CRITICS ASSAIL EFFORT TO CHANGE NEW YORK'S CHARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAN BARRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Its first public hearing does not take place until
Wednesday night, but already New York City's newly created Charter
Revision Commission is being criticized by good-government groups
and others as a cynically conceived agency with considerable power
to disturb the balance of government in favor of the panel's
creator, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strongest blow came Monday in a seven-page letter
from Frederick Schwarz Jr., the chairman of the 1989 charter
commission, the city's last, to the new commission's chairman,
Peter Powers. Schwarz laid out several ``very fundamental
concerns'' about the commission, from the lack of diversity among
its 12 members to its plans to consider eliminating the Office of
the Public Advocate and the Independent Budget Office, both of
which have been critical of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Schwarz expressed outrage that the commission
planned to move rapidly so that it could place charter questions on
November's ballot, apparently to meet the mayor's timetable.
Giuliani created the commission two months ago, primarily as a
means to block another referendum _ on whether tax money should be
spent on building a stadium for the New York Yankees in Manhattan _
from appearing on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor has been quoted as saying a Yankee Stadium
referendum is bad government,'' Schwarz wrote. ``As the old adage
has it, however, two wrongs do not make a right. More
fundamentally, the appointment of your commission with the signal
that it should operate on this truncated and inadequate schedule is
awful government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``An improper start will taint whatever this commission attempts
to do,'' wrote Schwarz, a Democrat who rarely enters the city's
political fray.
</P>
<P>
   Powers, a longtime friend of Giuliani's who was his first deputy
mayor, declined to respond specifically to Schwarz's letter. But he
defended the creation of the commission, saying it would examine
legitimate areas of inquiry, from the city's campaign-finance
system to its procurement process. ``If people feel that there's
not a diversity of view, it's all the more reason why they should
stop talking about process and start talking about substantive ways
of how we can change the charter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Giuliani administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, was less diplomatic, dismissing Schwartz's arguments as
``politically charged allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the matters at stake transcend both the mayor's
approval rating and the future home of a baseball team. The City
Charter is the document that lays out the operations of government
and the responsibilities of elected officials. Only twice in the
last 40 years have city officials opened it up for change, which
can only come by public vote.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz and others emphasized that they were not suggesting the
current charter was perfect. But they said Giuliani's approach
smacked of low-level politicking, rather than of lofty ideals.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One point of contention is the makeup of the commission, many of
whose 12 members have direct links to the mayor. Powers was his
first deputy mayor, Paul Crotty his corporation counsel, Howard
Wilson his commissioner of investigation. Vincent Marchiselli, a
former assemblyman from the Bronx, was a member of the Democrats
for Giuliani Committee in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Biderman, who was the commissioner for two agencies
under Mayor Edward Koch, was on Giuliani's transition team in 1993,
as did Herbert Rubin, a longtime lawyer to the Liberal Party.
Rubin's wife, Rose Luttan Rubin, is the chief judge for the city's
Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, to which she was
appointed by Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be qualified, but you want that commission to have
independence,'' said Eric Lane, a professor at Hofstra Law School
who was the 1989 commission's executive director. ``They're all his
buddies, and many of them have had their only governmental
experience through him.''
</P>
<P>
   In his letter, Schwarz did not question the integrity of the
commission's members, but contended that they did not represent
``the varied viewpoints in our city.'' And he zeroed in on the
events leading up to the panel's creation.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani created the commission in part to block the efforts of
Peter Vallone, the speaker of the City Council, to put a referendum
on the stadium proposal on November's ballot; according to city
law, a charter-related question takes precedence over other ballot
questions. The mayor's move reflected both his continuing problems
with the council and his opinion that Vallone, a Democrat, was
pushing the referendum to increase voter turnout when he is running
for governor.
</P>
<P>
   But Schwarz recalled that only a few months ago, Giuliani had
said that he saw no immediate need for charter revision. He
expressed outrage that the commission plans to hold five public
hearings, all at night and in early July, to meet time limits for
placing one or more questions on this fall's ballot.

No love lost as England, Argentina prepare to vie
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MONTPELLIER, France _ Between the ``Hand of God'' and the long arm
of the law, today's Argentina-England World Cup elimination match
figures to reach out and touch an array of emotional subjects.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of them are bitter _ the Falkland Islands War,
troublemaking hooligans, South American and European soccer pride
and memories of a crucial Argentine goal that probably should not
have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a massive game for both countries,'' English coach
Glenn Hoddle said. ``Both teams want this game very much.''
</P>
<P>
   For numerous reasons.
</P>
<P>
   First, there are the 12-year-old painfully hard feelings that
remain from the last time these soccer powers met at the 1986 World
Cup in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   It was then when Argentine great Diego Maradona made a pair of
spectacular goals to eliminate England and took a huge step toward
becoming the soccer legend he is today.
</P>
<P>
   Maradona's second goal in that game, the eventual game-winner in
Argentina's 2-1 victory, remains one of the most spectacular in
World Cup history, a brilliant zig-zagging play during which
numerous English players tried to snag the ball, only to see
Maradona rocket in a score.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the first of Maradona's goals that was dubbed the
``Hand of God'' goal, after everyone in the stadium except the
referee saw Maradona help the ball into the net with his fist.
</P>
<P>
   Asked after the game if he used his hand on the attempted
header, Maradona responded, ``It was the hand of God.''
</P>
<P>
   The English, including Hoddle, who played in the game, still
consider it a crime.
</P>
<P>
   One English newspaper bannered the headline, ``We can forget
(Falklands) war, but never Maradona.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very important game for everyone, and the way it was
won by Argentina left a sour taste in the mouth,'' Hoddle said.
``It was a tight game until that handball, which turned the
situation completely. This game has given us the chance to address
the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The game, which will be played at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard in
well-fortified Saint-Etienne, has so many other themes involved,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Fans from both soccer-loving nations began streaming into
Saint-Etienne on Monday, only to find a large security presence and
more bans on alcohol sales or consumption because of the hooligans
who follow the English team.
</P>
<P>
   Fans also found few tickets available, as barely more than 2,000
were allocated to each nation.
</P>
<P>
   World Cup organizers appear to be taking few chances in this
critical game, which spokesman Keith Cooper described as a
potential ``flash point'' for violence because of all the factors
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The 1982 Falkland Islands War involving Argentina and England
remains a bitter issue between the nations. Then there is the
matter of World Cup survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fans will consider anything less than a place in the final
game as a failure,'' Argentine star Gabriel Batistuta said. ``And
they would be right. We need this game. We cannot lose to
England.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hoddle: ``We have a chance to right a 12-year wrong. That
feeling of injustice has stayed with us a long time. This game can
help us get that out of our system.''

IT'S THEIR BALL, AND NBA OWNERS CALL FOR LOCKOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MIKE WISE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that could lead to the first work stoppage in National
Basketball Association history, the 29 league owners Monday agreed
to lock out the players and suspend all league business until the
two parties sign a new labor agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout will begin at midnight Tuesday night, when the
current collective bargaining agreement expires. With no
negotiations planned and several major economic issues to be
resolved, next season may not start on time.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Major League Baseball, the National Football League and
the National Hockey League, the NBA has averted losing games during
the regular season. This is the third time in four years that the
NBA has locked out its players. The last time was in 1996 for one
day.
</P>
<P>
   In September 1995, Commissioner David Stern announced the
signing of the six-year collective bargaining agreement that was
supposed to preserve labor peace into the next century. But a
three-year out clause enabled the owners to renegotiate the
contract if players salaries exceeded 51.8 percent of
basketball-related income.
</P>
<P>
   With a number of $100 million deals signed the last two years,
the salary figure reached more than 57 percent this season. On
March 23, the owners voted by 27-2 to reopen the collective
bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   During the lockout, teams will be prohibited from negotiating
with, signing or trading players. Team workout facilities will be
shut down and teams will not conduct or facilitate any summer
camps, exhibitions, practices, workouts, coaching sessions or team
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Only previously scheduled charity games were spared. Players
rehabilitating injuries will be forced to work out arrangements
through the team to be treated privately.
</P>
<P>
   The key issue is the owners' insistence on putting a ceiling on
salaries. Under a clause known as the Larry Bird exception, teams
can currently pay their own free agents whatever salary they want
to keep that player with the franchise. The rule has led to
All-Star veterans like Michael Jordan securing $30 million-plus,
one-year contracts that dwarf the team's annual salary cap. It has
also led to young phenoms like Kevin Garnett gobbling up $126
million over seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The owners have proposed that no player can make over 30 percent
of a team's total salary cap, meaning the highest-paid player in
the league would average about $10 million under the rules.
Thirteen players now make more than that amount a season.
</P>
<P>
   The owners have also proposed a five-year rookie scale, the
first three years of which would be guaranteed by the team. At the
end of that first contract, the team would have a right of first
refusal in order to keep the player.
</P>
<P>
   The current three-year rookie scale allows players unrestricted
free agency after their third season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all very difficult and of great concern to us,'' NBA
Deputy Commissioner Russ Granik said. ``But at some point you have
to deal with the lesser of two evils. You've got an economic system
that's just plain bad, and it results in the league being
unprofitable. You can't keep operating under that system in order
to make sure you don't upset fans or business partners. That's just
a prescription for total failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the players association executive director, said
the union was prepared to wage a long, bitter fight over the
bargaining table. Neither he nor Stern would rule out the
possibility of a strike-interrupted season, in which millions of
dollars in salary and revenue would be lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The owners' feeling is that the closer we get to the season, a
biological clock will go off in our players' heads and they'll
change their minds,'' Hunter said. ``They may have miscalculated
this time. If they realize the players are in for the long haul,
then they may become softer in their demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Granik said: ``The players are saying we don't want a hard cap
because that will eliminate the middle class. Well, the middle
class is already being eliminated. It has nothing do with the hard
cap. It has to do with guys at the high end are making too much
money on a relative basis. From the owners' standpoint, it's not
issue No. 1. Issue No. 1 is how much we're paying in total
salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, meanwhile, refer to the owners' proposals as
``givebacks.'' They see no reason to implement a system that
restricts their earning power.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the players were prepared to lose a season's worth of
pay, an amount totaling more than $1 billion, Hunter said, ``If we
have to.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: BLOW IT UP? JUST TRY TO FIND IT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All kidding aside, the mayor's much-maligned crisis
center is brilliantly conceived, and not just because it will be
bulletproof and bomb resistant. The genius is in its location: 7
World Trade Center.
</P>
<P>
   No terrorists will ever find the place. Or at least darned few
will. And if they come from out of town, forget it. Even New
Yorkers who work in that section of lower Manhattan have trouble
locating the building, which is actually on Vesey Street, across
from the main trade center complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's down there somewhere,'' said a woman on a smoking break
at Vesey and Church streets. She pointed vaguely in the direction
of the trade center. ``But I can't tell you which one it is.''
</P>
<P>
   She was hardly alone. Asked on Vesey Street how to get to 7
World Trade Center (``practice'' not being an acceptable answer),
one man shrugged, a young woman pointed the wrong way and a hot-dog
vendor jerked his head toward 5 World Trade Center. Some people got
it right. But the odds of a bum steer were exceptionally high.
</P>
<P>
   That will reassure anyone worried about the security of
officials who will take to the ``emergency control center'' when
disaster strikes. To others, though, it is a reminder of how
confusing it can be to get around certain neighborhoods, where many
buildings have highfalutin addresses that say nothing about where
they really are.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever tried to get to the Park Avenue Atrium? Its
address is 237 Park Ave., but there is no way to enter it from
Park. It is on Lexington Avenue, near East 46th Street. Park Avenue
Atrium just sounds ritzier than Lexington Avenue Atrium.
</P>
<P>
   Even weirder is 1325 Ave. of the Americas, which isn't within
shooting distance of that avenue. It is much closer to Seventh
Avenue, with entrances on West 53rd and 54th streets.
</P>
<P>
   If you can guess correctly where New York Plaza is, give
yourself a cigar. It is bounded by Whitehall, South, Water and
Broad Streets. Wall Street Plaza is not on Wall Street. It is the
fancy name for 88 Pine St. Even some workers at the post office's
Wall Street station, two blocks away, draw blanks when asked where
it is. You might think that 2 Times Square is in Times Square. Not
a chance. It sits on Duffy Square, a few blocks north.
</P>
<P>
   For near insanity, nothing tops a cluster of buildings around
Pennsylvania Station that bear Penn Plaza addresses. You
practically need a Sherpa guide to get around. Some buildings are
on Seventh Avenue, others on Eighth Avenue and still others on side
streets. Can someone please explain how No. 5 Penn Plaza came to be
two and a half blocks from No. 4?
</P>
<P>
   You may want a stiff drink after trying to pinpoint all 79 sites
designated ``plazas'' in Manhattan alone. But there is no mystery
to how the confusion came about.
</P>
<P>
   Developers love having these so-called vanity addresses. They
produce more tenants, which is good for the owners, and higher
rents, which is even better. That is nowhere more self-evident than
in pricey Manhattan. During the go-go 1980s, the borough
president's office, which had the final say, was more than willing
to play along. So were the emergency services, as long as they were
notified of changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``These addresses promote value and image, no question about
it,'' said Robert Emden, executive managing director of Grubb &AMP;
Ellis, commercial real-estate brokers in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Messinger, the unsuccessful Democratic candidate for mayor
last year, tried to halt the vanity giveaways after she became
Manhattan borough president in 1990. ``They were making life in the
city harder and harder,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not that she always prevailed. Witness an apartment building
that the owners chose to call 62 West 62nd St. It is east of 44
West 62nd, even though the logic of West Side numbering says that
No. 62 should be west of No. 44. ``We begged them to change it,''
Messinger said, arguing both safety and common sense. But the
developers, who liked the symmetry of 62 West 62nd, held their
ground and won in court.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, it is comforting to think about would-be
burglars being so confused by the illogical numbering that they
give up in despair. Similarly, you have to smile at the idea of
terrorist jackanapes thinking they can ever master this city enough
to find the mayor's downtown crisis center.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, aren't you surprised to have read this far without
hearing it called a bunker?

CONE SAYS HE WANTS TO REMAIN A YANKEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone sat between dozens of fans on a bench
beside some softball diamonds in Central Park on Monday, stressing
that he wants to stay with the Yankees even after the guaranteed
portion of his three-year contract ends this season.
</P>
<P>
   If Cone tosses 200 innings in 1998, he could exercise the $5.5
million option or become a free agent. If the pitcher does not, the
Yankees will pay a $1.5 million option and let him go or try to
sign him for a lesser amount. Cone conceded that if he reaches 200
innings, and he is on pace to pitch exactly 200, his baseball
address will not change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be hard to say anything else,'' Cone said. ``It's
obvious I enjoy playing here. I've settled here. I'm developing
charitable activities here. I think it's pretty obvious where my
heart lies. I can't think of a better situation to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a blue T-shirt, tan shorts and a maroon baseball cap,
Cone looked like just another New Yorker. That is the way he wants
it. It is one reason Cone was in the park sponsoring his charity
softball tournament on his first scheduled day off in three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   So even though Cone is pitching against the Phillies at Yankee
Stadium on Tuesday night and even though it would have been very
easy to punch the snooze button at 8 a.m. Monday, the 35-year-old
pitcher who embodies New York more than any other Yankee was
signing thousands of autographs, answering hundreds of questions
and watching dozens of players who paid $1,000 each to hang out
with major leaguers for a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a perfect fit to have a softball tournament that could
benefit a lot of charities and Central Park,'' Cone said. ``That's
about as New York as you can get.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Cone, David's wife, added: ``If he's not back here, it's
not going to be by his choice. I think you can safely say he wants
to finish his career here.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Brian Cashman called Cone ``special'' and
bluntly said: ``In terms of the future, he has an option and we'd
love for him to stay. I got to believe he'll get the 200 innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the presence of David Wells, Hideki Irabu and Orlando
Hernandez, who all have guaranteed contracts for 1999, and Andy
Pettitte and Ramiro Mendoza, two 26-year-olds who will be important
next season, Cashman said Cone is a major part of New York's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The general manager said there is a chance Cone and the Yankees
could announce later this season that they have agreed for him to
return in 1999 and erase the uncertainty over the 200 innings
trigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're expecting David to be here,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Cone wondered if his career was finished. Lynn
revealed that David painfully lifted his right arm up near his
shoulder one day, grimaced and spoke of retirement after he had
been battered for 16 runs in his first two starts. But when she was
asked if her husband, who is 10-1 with a 3.36 earned run average in
his last 12 starts, is still pondering retirement, Lynn said ``Not
this minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre voted for bringing Cone back by saying, ``I think he's
at the point where he's proven it health-wise so now he can do it
for a few more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Levy, the vice president of Cone's foundation, said
Monday's event was expected to raise around $100,000 with the cash
going to the Baseball Assistance Team, the Central Park
Conservancy, the City Parks Foundation and the Children's Hospital
at Westchester Medical Center. Cone wants to hold a tournament
annually, which would be much easier if he is pitching in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 200 innings is significant because if I reach that
level,'' Cone said. ``I can control my own destiny. Obviously, it's
very important for me to stay here.'' &QL;

RESTAURATEUR ENDS SUIT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Warner LeRoy, the owner of Tavern on the Green, has
withdrawn his lawsuit against the restaurateur David Bouley, and
their partnership in Bouley Bakery and several other projects in
TriBeCa has been dissolved. LeRoy, who had accused Bouley of
misappropriating money, reached an agreement with him on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The terms were not announced, but the agreement will leave
Bouley, one of the city's most respected chefs, the sole owner of
the Bouley Bakery and other projects in TriBeCa.
</P>
<P>
   The former partners have signed a confidentiality agreement,
Bouley said. A spokeswoman said LeRoy had no comment.
</P>
<P>
   LeRoy was seeking more than $4 million for his share of the
partnership, for which he paid $2 million. Bouley and LeRoy also
dissolved their partnership in the Russian Tea Room restoration,
Bouley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great because now we can go our separate ways and be
more productive,'' Bouley said.
</P>
<P>
   Bouley is negotiating with Credit Suisse Bank for a $25 million
loan to finance the projects, which include Danube, a Viennese
restaurant, a cooking school and Restaurant Bouley. &QL;

NINETY ARE CHARGED IN WELFARE-FRAUD SCHEMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Government workers created identities for as many as
50 nonexistent children to bilk the welfare system, prosecutors
said Monday, announcing that the workers were among 90 people
caught up in ongoing investigations of welfare fraud in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 90 people charged by prosecutors in Manhattan, 14 are
government workers. In many cases, welfare workers filed phony
records in exchange for kickbacks from welfare recipients, and the
workers typically kept 80 percent of the money, leaving just a
small amount for the applicants, said the Manhattan district
attorney, Robert Morgenthau.
</P>
<P>
   All told, those charged stole more than $1.3 million from the
city's welfare system by creating fake cases and collecting
payments for the nonexistent children, prosecutors said.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's case was the 11th prosecution resulting from regular
inquiries of welfare and housing assistance that the City
Department of Investigation has conducted over the last three
years. Edward Kuriansky, the city commissioner of investigation,
said the inquiries have resulted in the arrests of 622 people,
including 200 city employees, and involved the theft of $8.2
million in welfare and tenant subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the amount of theft represents a relatively small
portion of welfare payments _ the City Human Resources
Administration said it paid out $159 million in May alone _
Kuriansky said it showed how a small number of people could do a
lot of damage to the city treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is almost a case history in how much damage a few bad
apples can do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuriansky also noted that only a tiny percentage of the city's
welfare cases involved fraud. The welfare office involved in
Monday's charges _ the Dyckman Income Support Center in Inwood in
Upper Manhattan _ processed between 15,000 and 16,000 cases each
year, he said, but only 80 resulted in these prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutions are part of an overall city effort to tighten
supervision of welfare programs, an effort that includes such
measures as the fingerprinting of welfare recipients to prevent
people from applying for benefits twice, a practice known as double
dipping.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday announcing the charges, Morgenthau
said the cases were important because fraud undermines an important
city program vital to helping the poor. ``What we are trying to do
here is protect the welfare system from fraud,'' Morgenthau said.
``It is an effort to protect the welfare system for people who need
it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference, prosecutors described two schemes that
they say operated at the Dyckman Center. The first involved the
city's Fair Hearing program, in which welfare recipients seeking
extra money can challenge the amount they are paid.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Human Resources Administration workers at the
center filed false papers claiming that welfare recipients had won
Fair Hearing settlements, even though hearings had never been held.
They said that six current and three former Human Resources workers
were charged with carrying out the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Kuriansky said the fraud was uncovered after investigators
received a tip in 1995 that led to other arrests at the Dyckman
Center. He said that investigators discovered the fraudulent Fair
Hearing claims in part by checking whether hearings had actually
been held. Prosecutors said the hearing scheme was conducted
between 1992 and 1996 and cost the city $575,000.
</P>
<P>
   The second scheme, prosecutors said, involved the creation of
the false case files. They said that three Human Resources
employees used false birth certificates to open files on behalf of
several welfare recipients. In one case, prosecutors said, a woman
collected welfare while living in the Dominican Republic, and in
another the money was used to pay for a face lift. Many of the fake
files were opened in the names of children who did not exist, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the second scheme, which lasted from 1988 to
March of this year, cost the city $776,000.
</P>
<P>
   Kuriansky said the people involved in the scheme varied the
names of recipients and used different reasons to justify the
payments.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   City welfare officials have made efforts to change the system to
prevent similar frauds, Kuriansky said. Among the efforts are new
computer systems intended to find large or unusual payments to
welfare recipients, fingerprint checks to prevent people from
applying for duplicate benefits, and cross-checks by internal
auditors to insure that cases are not fabricated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would likely prohibit and prevent something like this from
happening in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kuriansky said that investigators have recommended that the
Human Resources Administration tighten a potential loophole. He
said that while adult welfare recipients are now fingerprinted
before they can receive benefits, guardians of children who receive
payments on behalf of those children are not required to be
fingerprinted. Kuriansky said that only one person should be
allowed to claim benefits for a single child.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Human Resources Administration said it is
now studying whether it should make the change.

NEWS CORP. IPO EXPECTED TO POWER DEEPER REACH INTO PRO SPORTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Another day, another deal.
</P>
<P>
   On the next to the last day of a month that has been vintage
Rupert Murdoch, the Australian tycoon announced his News Corp. is
going to 20 percent of its American entertainment and sports assets
to the public. The publicly held shares of the new Fox Group would
be worth around $4billion, making it one of the largest such
initial public offerings in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   While Murdoch said the major motivation for the IPO is to
persuade investors to assign more value to the conglomerate's U.S.
assets, analysts believe the move also underscores the 67-year-old
tycoon's commitment to outhustle rivals in the race to create the
world's leading media operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The global assets of this company have yet to be maximized,''
said Barry Hyman of Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``You can now expand
them much more easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's goal, analysts believe, is to obtain more broadcast
rights and programming assets. And if Murdoch's recent moves are
any indication, most of the $4 billion will be used to expand his
power over professional sports, now based on ownership of 22
regional sports networks, the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball
franchise and parts of the New York Rangers hockey and Knicks
basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch has also agreed to buy 40 percent of the new Staples
Center sports arena in downtown Los Angeles, and he has options to
buy 40 percent of the Los Angeles Kings hockey team and 10 percent
of the Los Angeles Lakers basketball franchise. He also owns
extensive baseball, hockey and football broadcast rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, Murdoch will be able to turn all these sports
holdings into a critical mass that will allow him a lot of leverage
over distribution,'' said Los Angeles sports consultant David
Carter. ``What slows him down are the rules against cross-ownership
of teams, which makes his strategy look a little disjointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver consultant Dean Bonham believes the benefits of creating
the new stock are twofold: News Corp. will gain more respectability
on Wall Street and Murdoch will find it far easier to make more
deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think he'll do with the money is use it to become the
dominant force in American sports,'' Bonham said. ``He'll try to
control as many franchises, facilities and networks as the rules
and regulations will allow.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds far-fetched, consider that during this year, News
Corp. has agreed to pay $550 million annually to keep broadcasting
pro football on its Fox stations; closed the Dodgers deal; agreed
to own parts of the Lakers, Kings and the Staples Center; traded
Dodgers stars Mike Piazza and Hideo Nomo; fired Dodgers manager
Bill Russell and general manager Fred Claire; and agreed to sell TV
Guide.
</P>
<P>
   Hyman said the increased scrutiny over Fox's operations will not
inhibit Murdoch. ``He already lives in Macy's front window as it
is,'' Hyman said. ``Who else besides Michael Jordan leads a more
public life? He's never been stymied from doing acquisitions.'' &QL;

   INDIA-BUSINESS-LUNCH (Bombay, India) _ Around noon on every
business day, Jaganath Adav strides briskly along the sidewalk of
Mahatma Gandhi Road in the heart of Bombay's business district,
into the granite fortress that serves as the head office of the
Hongkong Bank in India, and rides up to the ninth floor, where
currency traders in short sleeves peer over banks of blinking
computers. This is the new India, awakening in recent years from
economic slumber. But Adav, 35, is a torchbearer for the old and
often disparaged India, a man plying a trade little changed in 130
years. Even his job title, tiffin-wallah, derives from British
India's Victorian heyday, when English gentlemen who ruled the
roost partook of tiffin, a light lunch, and had it delivered by a
wallah _ an Urdu word used as a suffix to denote a function, duty

DEMOCRATS DIFFER SHARPLY IN SENATE PRIMARY DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOLTON LANDING, N.Y. _ Sharing a stage for the first time in
this campaign, the three Democratic candidates for Senate tangled
Monday over their allegiance to the tobacco industry, fund-raising
tactics and how President Clinton should deal with China.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates _ Geraldine Ferraro, Mark Green and Charles
Schumer _ struggled to keep the focus on the Republican incumbent,
Alfonse D'Amato, and avoid the recriminations that marred the
Democratic contest six years ago. But with just one more debate
scheduled until the weekend before the Sept. 15 primary, the stakes
here were significant, and the candidates' attempts at cordiality
slipped more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Green questioned Ferraro's judgment in accepting a $20,000
speaking fee from a tobacco company. Ferraro responded by accusing
Green of taking a contribution from a tobacco industry ($50, as it
turned out), and complained about Schumer's aggressive fund-raising
effort. And the three candidates differed on some substantive
issues, including the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The exchanges came in a free-flowing debate sponsored by the New
York State Broadcasters Association at the Sagamore Hotel, a
picturesque retreat on Lake George. The hourlong late-morning
session was moderated by Gabe Pressman of WNBC-TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, the 1984 vice presidential nominee, who is the
best-known of the candidates and has a strong lead in most polls,
has repeatedly declined attempts by her lesser-known colleagues to
get her to share a stage with them. The debate she agreed to Monday
seemed unlikely to win particularly widespread attention. It was
situated in a relatively remote part of New York, almost 90 minutes
by car from Albany, and it was not broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the clashes among the Democrats were provoked by Green,
the New York City public advocate, who has less money than either
Schumer, a congressman who represents Brooklyn and Queens, or
Ferraro, and thus was arguably under the most pressure to make the
most out this setting.
</P>
<P>
   In one notable exchange, Green attacked Ferraro for accepting
$20,000 to speak before a symposium sponsored by Philip Morris Co.
in Palm Beach, Fla., last year, when she worked as a commentator on
Crossfire, the CNN program. ``I really hope that Geraldine would
rethink the honorarium and give the money back,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro defended the fee, saying it had not prevented her from
supporting tough measures aimed at tobacco companies in Congress.
``Mark, I have no intention of giving the money back,'' Ferraro
said. ``As you well know, I paid taxes on it. And high taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, seeking to turn the tobacco tables on Green, she said:
``Mark, you've taken money from an officer of Philip Morris during
your public advocate campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that?'' Green said, sitting upright in one of four easy
chairs that had been set up on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro glanced down to the second row of the audience, where a
press aide was sitting between her husband, John Zaccaro and her
campaign manager, David Eichenbaum. ``Amanda, can _ '' but Green
cut off her attempt to seek assistance: ``No, no, no, no,
Geraldine.''
</P>
<P>
   After the debate, Eichenbaum identified the Philip Morris
executive as David Dangoor, an executive vice president who he said
had contributed $50, a minimal contribution by today's standards,
to Green's campaign in 1993. Green said he did not know Dangoor,
and would return the $50 if Ferraro returned the $20,000 she
received.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates were unified in attacking what they said were the
shortcomings of D'Amato, whom they described as conservative,
politically dishonest and a creature of his contributors. And all
three signaled that they would focus on D'Amato's opposition to
abortion rights.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I am going to take the issue of choice to Al D'Amato and show
the voters of New York he's an extremist,'' Schumer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro said: ``He has even supported a constitutional amendment
to ban abortion under all circumstances, even when the life of a
mother is at stake. That is an issue, I have to tell you, that
Republican women are looking at and saying, `There is no way that
we're going to allow this man to take that right away.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats disagreed with one another _ and with Clinton _ on
how the United States should handle China. Schumer said Clinton
should not have visited Tiananmen Square. ``There was such a brutal
massacre that I think you could draw the line and show the Chinese,
yes I want to come, yes I want to engage you, but there are certain
things you should not do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Green said he did not think the United States should
continue awarding China most-favored-nation trade status, given the
country's human-rights record. Both Schumer and Ferraro endorsed
Clinton's position that it would be an economic and political
mistake to exclude China from world trade markets.
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also clashed on the death penalty. Green, taking
a position that is historically popular in Democratic primaries in
New York and drawing a distinction between himself and his two
opponents, strongly argued against capital punishment. ``I don't
believe it deters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer found himself defending what he has presented as one of
the bigger triumphs of his campaign: his aggressive fund raising.
He asserted he needed to counteract Ferraro's name recognition and
the fact that Green spent $2 million during an effectively
uncontested bid for re-election as public advocate last year.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, who is a member of the Banking Committee, said ``very
little'' of that money came from banking interests. But Ferraro
asserted she had firsthand knowledge that Schumer was soliciting
from those sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be quite frank, the reason I know that is if I call up and
say, `Hey listen, I'd love you to get involved in my campaign,'
they say, `I can't. D'Amato is on the Banking Committee. Schumer is
on the Banking Committee. I can't give to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Ferraro said in response to a question that the campaign
had followed a generally high road so far. Pressman looked startled
at her response, and reminded Ferraro that she had called her
rivals ``liars'' two weeks ago for denying they had strong-armed
delegates at the Democratic state convention. He asked if she was
rescinding it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I don't know if I take that back,'' Ferraro said. ``I am
saying that that's behind us. I may have been a little tired
then.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Ferraro said it was possible she would agree to
further encounters, she also said she did not view such sessions
either as an efficient use of her time or enlightening to voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you that I ran for vice president of the United
States, in case anyone forgot,'' Ferraro after the debate,
referring to 1984, when she was the running-mate of Walter Mondale.
``You know how many debates I had with George Bush? One.''

FOX IPO WOULD GIVE INVESTORS SHOT AT PIECE OF ENTERTAINMENT PIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ News Corp.'s decision to sell a minority ownership
in its Fox franchise gives investors the chance to directly own a
major entertainment firm without unrelated assets clouding the
offering, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pure play,'' said Steve Cesinger, managing director of
Greif &AMP; Co., an investment banker in Los Angeles. ``Investors may
be interested in the programming and content (of Fox) in the U.S.,
not Murdoch's newspapers in Europe and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In a ``pure play,'' investors buy into a company in which its
core operations are in one market or category. In this case, it
would be entertainment content.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street cheered the news, driving News Corp.'s American
depository reciepts up 3 9/16 to 33 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   American depository receipts, or ADRs, are certificates traded
in a U.S. exchange to represent securities of a foreign company.
They are issued by U.S. banks to represent a certain amount of
foreign securities they hold in the foreign entity's country of
origin. ADRs make trading foreign securities in the U.S. easier by
eliminating currency exchanges, among other hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox offering likely won't be an ADR, since it represents
American operations and the subsidiary probably will be based in
the United States, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Australia-based News Corp. said it will offer to the
public its Fox Group, consisting of its U.S. filmed entertainment,
TV programming and distribution, and sports team assets. Twentieth
Century Fox, the Fox Television Group and the Los Angeles Dodgers,
among other entities, would fall under this umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Up to 20 percent of the Fox Group will be offered to investors
in an initial public offering expected to debut on Wall Street by
the end of the year. News Corp. expects to register a filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission within three months, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the offering _ such as what price the shares will
trade at, or how many shares will be offered _ won't be available
until the filing.
</P>
<P>
   News Corp.'s plan is for an equity offering, not a spin-off,
which AT&AMP;T did with Lucent. In a spin-off, the parent company
distributes all or most of its shares of the subsidiary to its
existing stockholders. It's usually accompanied by an IPO, where
new shares are issued and sold. The subsidiary becomes a separately
traded company.
</P>
<P>
   By making the IPO announcement without an SEC filing, News Corp.
is likely testing the investment community's interest in its Fox
franchise at a time when the IPO market is lackluster from too many
offerings, said Tom Taulli, a market analyst at IPO Monitor, a Los
Angeles-area online IPO tracking service.
</P>
<P>
   If the offering is successful, analysts think that Murdoch might
consider spinning off Fox and going public with News Corp.'s other
holdings.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no guarantee that the Fox IPO will be received well,
despite its household name, Taulli said. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's IPO
didn't perform well because of its debt load, even though the movie
studio has a well-known brand name. &QL;

MARION CARL, 82, MARINE AIR ACE IN WORLD WAR II 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Marion Carl, one of the leading Marine air aces of
World War II and a record-setting test pilot, was shot to death on
Sunday night in a robbery at his home in Roseburg, Ore., the
Douglas County Sheriff's Department said. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Carl, who was credited with 18{ ``kills'' in Pacific combat
against the Japanese and commanded the Second Marine Air Wing in
the Vietnam War, was pronounced dead at Mercy Medical Center in
Roseburg. His wife, Edna, who suffered a glancing shotgun burst to
the head, was treated at the hospital and released.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Carl told the authorities that a man carrying a shotgun
broke into their home about 10:35 p.m. as she was reading a
newspaper and demanded cash and car keys. Mrs. Carl said that when
her husband emerged from a bedroom and confronted the gunman, he
shot both of them. The gunman took $200 to $400 and drove off in
the couple's car, which was found abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities issued a warrant for the arrest of Jesse Stuart
Fanus, 19, who has a record of arrests for drunken driving,
burglary and criminal trespass, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Eugene Carl was born on a dairy farm in Hubbard, Ore. He
received an engineering degree from Oregon State University in
1938, won his Marine wings and was commissioned as a second
lieutenant on Dec. 1, 1939.
</P>
<P>
   Carl first saw combat in the Battle of Midway in June 1942, then
arrived on Guadalcanal on Aug. 20, 1942, 13 days after the Marines
had come ashore in an effort to wrest the island from the Japanese.
He was among the pilots who engaged in the first dogfights over
Guadalcanal, and was shot down on Sept. 9, 1942. He floated for
four hours in his life jacket before being picked up by an island
native in a canoe.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Carl became a military test pilot.
</P>
<P>
   He set a world air-speed record on Aug. 25, 1947, when he flew a
Douglas Skystreak at more than 650 miles an hour over Muroc Dry
Lake in California.
</P>
<P>
   He set an unofficial world altitude record on Aug. 21, 1953,
when he ascended to 83,235 feet over Muroc, flying a Douglas
Skyrocket. His rocket plane was dropped from a B-29 at 34,000 feet.
After going to 28,000 feet, he began climbing. The mark was not an
official record because it was not ground to air.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he flew U-2 reconnaissance missions over China.
</P>
<P>
   In 1950, he estimated he had flown more than 100 types of
airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A good pilot doesn't take chances,'' he said. ``But being a
good pilot is a matter of constant flying, constant practice and
thoroughly knowing your airplane. What might be a chance to some
pilots isn't to others. I never quit practicing.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. F.M. Trapnell, a former commanding officer of the Naval
Air Test Center, once said that ``Carl has no nervousness and no
uncertainty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean he has no fear,'' Trapnell said. ``Any man who
isn't afraid sometimes is a fool. Carl has a quiet sureness. He
goes about his job as if he were getting ready to milk a cow. It
makes his work twice as easy _ or maybe he just makes it look twice
as easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl retired from military service in 1973, having logged 13,000
flying hours. He received numerous decorations, including the Navy
Cross and the Distinguished Flying Cross.

SPORTS STOCKS OFTEN BENCH PLAYERS RATHER THAN STARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ So you want to own a piece of the L.A. Dodgers but
are disappointed ``Ally McBeal'' comes with them? Consider yourself
lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Sports teams that are packaged with other businesses _ as News
Corp. intends to do with the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball team and
the rest of its Fox Group division _ generally are a better value
for investors than sports franchises standing alone in the
marketplace, said analysts surveyed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the performance of the Boston Celtics LP, now a stock
market veteran, and the Cleveland Indians Baseball Co. Inc., a
newcomer to the field.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, it turns out, has been much of a bargain for investors
as both are trading well below their 52-week highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one common denominator you find when a sports team goes
public is that the investors (in) the IPO don't make a lot of
money. The owner of the company makes a lot of money,'' said Mark
Cunningham, analyst for SQC Research Duke in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason, as in the case of the Celtics and Indians, is
that initial investors buy on emotion rather than sound finances,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Celtics went public in 1987 they valued the franchise
at $120 million and they have just announced a private transaction
that I think values the Celtics at $150 million. So over 10 years
it's not a very good investment,'' said Peter A. Russ, an analyst
at Laidlaw Global Securities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Deals that work out better for all concerned have business lines
other than sports.
</P>
<P>
   For example, The Walt Disney Co. and Time Warner Inc. are
trading near their 52-week high. Disney owns the Anaheim Mighty
Ducks hockey team and Anaheim Angels baseball team; Time Warner
owns the Atlanta Braves baseball and Hawks basketball teams.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to prove that the Angels' and Braves'
performances on the field have helped push their parent companies'
shares up. Then again, both teams are broadcast on cable channels
owned by their parent companies, and first-place teams like the
Angels and Braves draw more viewers, which increases revenue.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of diversity serves investors better, said Harry
Vinezia, an analyst at Raymond James who follows the Florida
Panthers Holdings Inc., owners of the Panthers pro hockey team and
some other properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Panthers were first a public company it was just the
Panthers,'' he said. ``But since they have diversified into lodging
and the restaurant industry, it has definitely helped the stock.
And it make the company more viable because it smooths out the cash
flow streams and takes some of the operating risk out of the
company.''

   James Fallows, the editor of U.S. News &AMP; World Report, said
Monday he was fired Monday by the magazine's owner, Mortimer
Zuckerman, after less than two years on the job.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued later in the day by the magazine's editorial
director, Harold Evans, confirmed the dismissal but gave no reasons
for it and announced that Fallows would be replaced by Stephen G.
Smith, editor of National Journal, a Washington weekly that
specializes in government and politics.
</P>
<P>
   In a 19-page memorandum that Fallows read aloud to his staff
Monday morning, he said, ``Mort Zuckerman has decided that I should
leave the magazine and that a new editor should come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Fallows, who declined to be interviewed, said Zuckerman was
seeking a change in direction at the magazine and that the two men
had fundamental differences over news coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows cited as an example the shooting death of the fashion
designer Gianni Versace. (Zuckerman felt it was given too few
pages, Fallows said in his memo.)
</P>
<P>
   ``While I do not think he has a good reason for making this
change,'' Fallows wrote, ``clearly he has the right.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the maneuvering at the magazine, Fallows issued a
clarifying statement later in the day, saying that Zuckerman
``would like it to be made clear that, on the issue of who is
responsible for deciding that I should leave the magazine, Harry
Evans has full authority to make that decision, and the choice was
in fact ultimately his.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans has an interest in establishing his authority at the
magazine. Since he stepped down as president and publisher of
Random House's trade group last fall, amid speculation that he had
been forced out, people in the media industry have been wondering
what the once high-profile Evans had been up to.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Noah, an editor at U.S. News, called Evans ``a
papier-mache boss'' who is ``frantically trying to look like he's
not taking orders from Mort.''
</P>
<P>
   But Evans emphasized Monday that he was the one in control of
the Fallows situation. ``It was my responsibility and it was my
decision,'' he said in an interview. ``I don't want to get into
details about it, but I thought it was time for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans also sent a memo to the staff reminding them that he has
responsibility for hiring and firing.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman, backed up his deputy. ``It's Harry's job and its
Harry's responsibility and it's Harry's authority,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fallows, 48, came to U.S. News in September 1996 from The
Atlantic Monthly, where he was Washington editor. His appointment
got the attention of the industry, in part, because of his book,
``Breaking the News: How the Media Undermined American Democracy,''
which was highly critical of the media and because he began his
tenure by making some controversial staff changes.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was his decision to remove political columnist
Stephen Roberts, whom he had criticized for using his position to
generate large speaking fees.
</P>
<P>
   Under Fallows, the magazine's struggle for a niche became more
intense, given the greater resources and later press times of its
competitors, Time and Newsweek. (U.S. News has a circulation of
about 2.2 million; Newsweek, 3.2 million and Time, 4.2 million.)
</P>
<P>
   Fallows' memorandum read in part as a defense of his record at
U.S. News, praising various aspects of the magazine's look and
coverage. ``I am tremendously proud of what we have accomplished,
and I hope you are too,'' he wrote. ``This magazine is better than
it was two years ago, and you deserve the credit _ and my lasting
gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming editor of National Journal, Smith was the
founding editor of Civilization Magazine. He has also served as
executive editor of Newsweek, held various editorial posts at Time
magazine and worked at several newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to improve the format and the design,'' Smith said
Monday. ``Give the magazine more pace, crop photographs a little
more boldly and run more boxes and shorter stories _ that way I
think we can better gain the attention of our readers.''

CITY VENDETTA ALLEGED BY DEFENSE FOR ASSEMBLYMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The federal corruption case against Assemblyman Dov
Hikind of Brooklyn originated with city investigators who were
pursuing a Giuliani administration vendetta against Hikind and a
social services group, a defense lawyer contended in court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Hikind, D-Borough Park, is charged in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn with illegally seeking and receiving payoffs from leaders
of the group, the Council of Jewish Organizations of Borough Park,
in return for obtaining hundreds of thousands of dollars in state
funds for the group. The 15-year veteran of the Assembly is accused
of taking at least $40,000 from the government grants that had been
given to the group, which is widely known as COJO.
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments are to begin Tuesday in the trial after six
weeks of testimony. The Borough Park group's former employment and
training director, Rabbi Elimelech Naiman, is also a defendant in
the case. Like Hikind, Naiman, who is charged with fraud and other
offenses, has insisted he committed no crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The contention that the prosecution was born of hostility in
City Hall was made by Naiman's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, who sought
unsuccessfully to call as a witness a city lawyer who had worked on
the case in its initial stages.
</P>
<P>
   Brafman told Judge Charles Sifton that he needed to call the
lawyer, Susan Ross, of the city's Department of Investigation,
because she had ``unique information'' that the initial decision to
pursue the case was ``politically motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Investigation under the current mayor of New
York City, because COJO had become too powerful, marked it for
extinction,'' Brafman asserted. He maintained that Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani and a top aide, whom he did not identify, ``openly spoke
of this as the end of the reign of Dov Hikind and COJO.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's press secretary, Colleen Roche, later responded that
Brafman's statements had ``no basis in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really unfortunate and sad that such arguments are made
in desperation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sifton rejected Brafman's request to call Ms. Ross, saying that
the kind of information he was seeking from her would more
appropriately have been sought in pretrial discovery proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Brafman suggested in court that he knew about the purported
conversation from several Giuliani administration aides whom he
said he had interviewed but who, ``because of fear of losing their
jobs, could not come into court to testify.'' Later Brafman
declined to elaborate on his statements in court.
</P>
<P>
   Hikind's supporters have maintained that although the
assemblyman had backed the Republican mayor in his races for City
Hall in 1989 and 1993, Hikind fell out of favor with the Giuliani
administration when he supported George Pataki, another Republican,
for governor in 1994. Giuliani backed the Democratic incumbent,
Mario Cuomo, in that election.
</P>
<P>
   Hikind is accused of receiving the COJO funds in the form of
payments for items like tuition for his children and other
relatives, family trips abroad and campaign and fund-raising
activities. Sifton on Monday narrowed the charges against him by
dismissing some of the conspiracy and fraud counts.

JUDGE BLOCKS N.J. LAW BANNING SEX BOOKS FROM JAIL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ New Jersey's broad, new law banning sexually
oriented books, photographs and films from a prison for sex
offenders remained in legal limbo Monday after a federal judge
again refused to let the state enforce it and called the measure's
constitutionality into question.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Alfred Wolin, in Newark, declined to issue a
final opinion on the law, saying he wanted to give the state
attorney general's office a second chance to argue its merits. But
calling the law too broad and vague, Wolin said the burden the
state faces in convincing him of its constitutionality ``appears to
be insurmountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The law's ``plain language mandates that certain everyday
literature would be banned'' from the prison, the Adult Diagnostic
and Treatment Center in Avenel, Wolin said. Monday's decision
extends a temporary halt to the law imposed June 1 by the judge,
who said he agreed with contentions in a suit filed by two inmates
that the law would prevent them from reading the Bible and fashion
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Avenel's 750 inmates have committed sex crimes at least
twice and been classified by judges as ``repetitive and
compulsive'' offenders. The state maintains that sexually oriented
material hinders the rehabilitation of the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   But in his opinion, Wolin said a literal reading of the law
would give prison administrators the authority to ban newspapers
with sexually suggestive advertisements or copies of ``National
Geographic'' that had photographs of bare-breasted women.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Peter Verniero said he was disappointed that
Wolin had blocked enforcement of the law for a second time.
Verniero said his staff remained convinced of the law's merits and
constitutionality. The judge set a hearing for July 20 for new
arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Lustberg, the court-appointed lawyer for the inmates,
called Wolin's opinion a ``terrific victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It vindicates our argument that this is unjustifiable
censorship,'' Lustberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections Commissioner Jack Terhune declined to comment
because the case is still pending, said a spokeswoman, Julia
Marian-Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   Materials banned by the law, passed last January, include those
containing ``any description, narrative account, display, or
depiction of sexual activity or associated anatomical area.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolin contended Monday that the law was inspired more by
``outraged'' legislators than by concern about rehabilitation. He
noted that Avenel administrators officially opposed the law before
Governor Christie Whitman signed it.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that Avenel's director of psychology, Nancy
Graffin, did not testify before the Legislature about the law and
did not know the statute existed until May, one month before it was
to take effect.
</P>
<P>
   The inmates who filed the lawsuit, Richard Waterman and Michael
Curtis, are both repeat offenders. Waterman is serving a 54-year
term for sexually abusing a 9-year-old girl and had earlier been
convicted of raping an 11-year-old and fondling another 9-year-old
girl. Curtis is serving 20 years for sexually abusing a 14-year-old
boy and had been convicted in Arizona of sexually assaulting a
15-year-old boy.

TEEN-AGER ADMITS USING VIRUS TO STEAL COMPUTER PASSWORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CHARLIE LeDUFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A teen-age computer hacker pleaded guilty in
Manhattan federal court on Monday to stealing more than 500
passwords from America Online users last year.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said that the teen-ager, referred to in court papers
as John Doe, had obtained the passwords by sending e-mail messages
to America Online subscribers from February through April.
</P>
<P>
   When the clients clicked on an attachment included with the
message, a computer virus known as a Trojan horse, because it
cloaks its true purpose, was activated and secretly recorded the
users' keystrokes, including their passwords, said Mary Jo White,
the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The passwords were then forwarded by the virus program to an
e-mail account that the teen-ager held under a false identity on
Juno, a Manhattan-based Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   It did not appear that the teen-ager was able to, or attempted
to, profit from his work. Credit cards numbers were not taken, and
thus no merchandise was purchased with them over the Internet, said
Tricia Primrose, a spokeswoman for America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager was charged with unlawful interception of
electronic communication, a felony, but because of his age he
pleaded guilty to an act of juvenile delinquency. Normally, the
sentence for that crime is six months' probation, according to
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers with the U.S. attorney's office declined to discuss the
specifics of the case, citing confidentiality. They did say,
however, that the boy had obtained the computer program used to get
the passwords through a person he had met on line.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager's lawyer declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
that the teen-ager had been caught by the federal authorities with
the help of Juno, which alerted the authorities when the teen-ager
called into his account. The call was subsequently traced.

NEW JERSEY GOVERNOR IN DEAL TO RAISE GAS TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Overcoming opposition from some Republican
lawmakers reluctant to raise taxes, Gov. Christie Whitman reached
agreement with legislative leaders Monday to increase the state's
gasoline tax gradually _ 4 cents a gallon over three years _ to
help pay for transportation projects around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The tax increase is 3 cents less a gallon than what Whitman
proposed in May. Two of those cents would have gone toward
preserving a million acres of farmland and open space, nearly half
the undeveloped land left in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers are now considering another proposal to ask voters
whether they would support a plan to borrow $1 billion over 30
years for preserving open space. The other proposed 1-cent increase
would have been spent on transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists would not see the full impact of the 4-cent-a-gallon
gasoline tax at the pumps all at once. Under the plan, the gasoline
tax would rise by 1 cent next year, 2 cents the following year and
1 cent more in the year 2001. The increase would be contingent on
voters' approval of a referendum in November, which would ask them
whether they supported a gasoline tax increase and whether they
approved dedicating all motor vehicle tax revenues to
transportation projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that this is the right thing to do,'' said the
Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, R-Salem County. ``I am sure that
this will be a bipartisan effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement on the gasoline tax increase came as both the
Assembly and the Senate gave final approval to a new $18.2 billion
state budget for the new fiscal year beginning July 1. The budget
raises spending by almost $1 billion over this year for public
schools, state colleges and a handful of other programs. And it
puts $661 million aside for the state's rainy day fund.
</P>
<P>
   With the gasoline tax increase, the Whitman administration
expects to spend $200 million more on transportation projects in
the next two years than had been budgeted.
</P>
<P>
   The increase would allow the state to pay the higher borrowing
costs for expanding the state's Transportation Trust Fund, the
system used to finance highway and mass transit projects.
Administration officials said spending would rise to $900 million
from $700 million in 1999 and 2000. It would increase to $950
million annually in the following three years.
</P>
<P>
   After lawmakers rejected the 2-cent-a-gallon increase for
open-space preservation, Whitman continued to push for a
5-cent-a-gallon increase for transportation projects. But
lawmakers, particularly Republican members of the General Assembly
who face re-election next year, balked at raising taxes while the
state's economic boom was pouring extra revenues into the state's
coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plan will produce about $400 million less in
estimated new revenues from the gasoline tax than what the
administration first proposed, her aides said that the
4-cent-a-gallon increase would meet the administration's
transportation goals. ``It works,'' said Pete McDonough, a
spokesman for the governor. ``We can get a program large enough to
meet the needs of the state.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Collins said the Legislature would return in late July to
consider the gasoline tax increase. At the end of three years, it
would raise state taxes on gasoline to 18.5 cents a gallon from
14.5 cents. Collins also said the Legislature would consider two
other bills, asking voters to dedicate motor vehicle tax revenues
for transportation projects and support the 30-year borrowing plan
to preserve a million acres of farmland and other open space.
</P>
<P>
   The state budget, which Whitman is expected to sign into law on
Tuesday, was approved by the Legislature with bipartisan support
for the first time in almost a decade. Democrats were able to share
some of the budget surplus with their Republican colleagues for
various projects in their legislative districts. The total spending
was $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   But some Democrats voted against the budget because of language
that the Whitman administration had quietly inserted that would
establish a state-appointed fiscal review board to oversee the city
of Camden's finances. The city is looking for a $15 million bailout
from the state to balance its books, and the administration insists
the money would only be allocated if a state-run financial review
board is in place.

JAIL SUIT DROPPED BY FEDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Sheriff Joe Arpaio declared victory Monday over the
federal government after Justice Department attorneys ended a
three-year probe of Maricopa County jails by dropping a lawsuit
over inmate abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Although a dismissal motion says the case was terminated only
after the sheriff complied with jail improvements required in a
settlement, Arpaio said the action proves that prisoners never were
victims of systemic mistreatment, as alleged in the lawsuit and a
government study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to put up with this for three years. Three years!'' the
sheriff said. ``Over what? It's been dismissed . . . Evidently, all
these allegations that have been going on for three years were not
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers in Washington, D.C., declined comment
on any aspect of the case, including what steps were taken to
determine that jail conditions had improved.
</P>
<P>
   The civil complaint was filed in U.S. District Court here in
October, along with a settlement agreement which said the case
would be dropped if Arpaio lived up to numerous reform promises for
six months.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit alleged not only that inmates were subjected to
mistreatment, but that sheriff's officials were ``deliberately
indifferent'' to it. The lawsuit also said Arpaio's administration
failed to discipline abusive jailers.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Arpaio and his staff insisted that dropping the case
is a tacit admission by Justice Department officials that there
never was wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said the lengthy investigation was spawned by his
enemies, and amounted to a ``free consulting study'' that wasted
taxpayer money. He said there are occasional problems in the county
jails, but that he deals with those himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't need the Justice Department or Civil Liberties Union
or Amnesty International or the Boy Scouts to come down here and
try to accuse my people,'' Arpaio said. ``If you wanna get the
sheriff, go after the sheriff. Don't take on my employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio's public information staff trumpeted the development in a
news release with the headline: ``Justice is done. Jail brutality
claims unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack McIntyre, an attorney with the Sheriff's Office, proclaimed
that allegations of systemic abuse were ``thoroughly repudiated.''
</P>
<P>
   When the lawsuit was filed, Janet Napolitano, then-U.S. attorney
for Arizona, characterized it as a legal formality, while Arpaio
vowed that nothing would change his management of the jails.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the motion for dismissal claims there have been substantial
jail improvements in use-of-force policies, booking operations,
Tent City conditions, grievance procedures, staffing and training,
among other things.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement agreement required all of those changes, along
with a ban on hog-tying inmates, using restraint chairs as
punishment, and using pepper spray or stun devices except on
combative prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Closure of the case ends a federal investigation that began in
August 1995 and included two evaluations of jail operations.
</P>
<P>
   Correctional expert Eugene Miller's review led Justice
Department lawyers to allege that inmates were victims of violence
without justification, in some cases after they had been handcuffed
or placed in restraint chairs.
</P>
<P>
   After Arpaio condemned that report, the Justice Department hired
George Sullivan _ another expert on incarcerations _ to review jail
conditions. Sullivan also wrote a critical report, leading to the
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation, Arpaio insisted that his office
appropriately dealt with isolated instances of mistreatment.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff's officials pointed out that one of Sullivan's major
criticisms _ the arming of all guards with pepper spray or taser
devices _ was part of a project funded by the Justice Department.
They also said reforms listed in the court case were in place
before the lawsuit was filed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the use-of-force case is resolved, medical and mental
health care within the jails remain under a federal investigation. &QL;

METS STRUGGLING TO RECAPTURE MAGIC OF '97 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets are still gamely chasing the Atlanta Braves
in the National League East and are just a step or two behind the
San Francisco Giants in the race for the National League wild-card
berth. Yet while both teams present tantalizing targets, the team
the Mets most want to emulate right now is none other than the 1997
version of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets are 43-34 heading into Tuesday night's inter-league
contest against the Blue Jays in Toronto, the same record the '97
club carried into its 78th game. That team stood 6{ games behind
Atlanta after going 43-34. This year's club is 7{ games out.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the perception seems to be that the Mets are struggling to
get back the magic of a year ago, when the `97 club generated its
own special excitement despite often sparse turnouts at Shea
Stadium. The Mets of a year ago led the majors with 47
come-from-behind victories. They also won 24 games in their final
at-bat, equaling the major league best.
</P>
<P>
   Such moxie assured the franchise a winning season (88-74) for
the first time since 1990. It also set a standard, one the 1998
club sometimes seems to struggle to meet, despite similar
achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Take Sunday night's victory over the visiting Yankees. The Mets,
playing in a nationally televised game, won when the club's hottest
hitter, Carlos Baerga, opened the ninth inning with a double off
reliever Ramiro Mendoza. Butch Huskey, unaccustomed to having to
bunt, did so with great efficiency, moving Baerga to third. After
Brian McRae drew an intentional walk, Luis Lopez delivered a
game-winning sacrifice fly, Baerga scoring before the meandering
McRae was nearly doubled off first base.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the 11th time this season the Mets had won in their
final at-bat. Yet the number of such victories was overshadowed by
the club's desperate need to avoid a three-game sweep at the hands
of the cross-town rivals. That the victory also left the Mets
practically begging for more late comebacks showed how they are
frantic to recreate the magic touch of a year ago, not only in
reality, but perception as the team searches for its own identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't so much us beating the Yankees in the third game,''
said Huskey. ``It was more us not losing three games in a row.
These were three big games and those guys have experience over
there, they've experienced big games a lot. A lot of our guys
haven't. So a lot of our guys had a lot of adrenaline rushing. It's
just something we've got to control better. And the only way you
get experience with that is being in the atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of the architects of the victory _ Baerga and reliever
Dennis Cook _ have the ability to show younger Mets how to get to
the next level. For Baerga, somnambulant at the plate early this
season but now batting .283, is a veteran from the winning
Cleveland Indians teams of the mid-1990s. Cook helped the Florida
Marlins win a World Series title last year.
</P>
<P>
   Baerga not only scored the game's winning run, but drove in the
Mets' first run, with a sixth-inning single. That hit was the Mets'
first off the all-but-untouchable Yankees' rookie, Orlando
Hernandez, giving the team a chance to live on until the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Another chance was provided by Cook, who remains the one
reliable reliever to set up closer John Franco. Cook, assigned to
stop the horde of Yankees' left-handed power hitters, threw two
scoreless innings, striking out three, enabling the Mets to remain
in a 1-1 tie until the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   In his last 18 games the left-handed veteran has allowed only
one earned run in 181/3 innings, lowering his earned run average
from 4.76 to 2.10. That not only gives Bobby Valentine a legitimate
response to teams that feature left-handed threats, like the
Yankees' Paul O'Neill, Tino Martinez and Darryl Strawberry. It
gives the manager a choice in tough situations, something the
struggling Mel Rojas doesn't often present.

POLICE REPORTS PROBED IN SHOOTING OF SQUEEGEE MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Police Department is investigating
whether some of the detectives who worked on the case of an
off-duty police officer accused of shooting a ``squeegee man'' in
the Bronx skewed their reports to make the shooting appear
justifiable, police officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry focuses on whether the first detectives on the scene
of the June 14 shooting tried to cover up for the officer, Michael
Meyer, by suggesting that he had fired his gun because he was being
robbed by the squeegee man, Antoine Reid, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives from the Internal Affairs Bureau took over the case
later that night and arrested Meyer on a charge of second-degree
attempted murder, saying that he had fired without provocation
after Reid put soap on his windshield without permission.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Internal Affairs Bureau is investigating why the police
reports written by some of the first detectives on the scene
contain statements by witnesses who talk about the possibility of a
robbery attempt, but the reports written by the Internal Affairs
detectives who took over the case do not, officials said. The
internal investigation was first reported in The Daily News Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, a police spokeswoman, said that Internal Affairs
began its investigation last week. ``The issue is the reports and
if there is a bias in the reports,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid said in an interview a few days after the shooting that
Meyer first raised the issue of robbery right after shooting him in
the chest. ``He walked, picked up my squeegee and said: `See,
everybody? He tried to rob me,''' Reid said. He said two women who
had witnessed the shooting and had come to his aid, holding his
hands, did not believe the charge. ``They said: `Aw, get out of
here. He ain't try to rob you. You just shot him,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid was released from the hospital on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry began as the department announced that it would help
federal prosecutors investigate accusations that police officers
had perjured themselves and colluded to protect a colleague, a
former officer, Francis Livoti, who was convicted last week in U.S.
District Court of violating the civil rights of a Bronx man who
died in his custody in 1994.

GM JOB SHOULD NOT HURT LASORDA'S HEALTH
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Dodgers internist Michael Mellman wasn't
consulted when Tom Lasorda was given the stress-filled general
manager's position less than two years after being sidelined with a
heart condition. But Lasorda has the blessing of Mellman, who
monitored the former manager during two angioplasty procedures in
1996 that helped eliminate blockage in the arteries leading to the
heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy had a heart problem, but it has been treated and he is
well enough for his new assignment,'' Mellman said. ``The general
manager's position can be taxing, but it is far different than the
manager, who is closely involved with every pitch in each game. If
a GM is on the road and doesn't feel good, he can stay at the
hotel. The manager can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who turns 71 in September, underwent a routine physical
exam just days before taking over for fired executive vice
president Fred Claire. Mellman said Lasorda's blood pressure and
cholesterol levels were normal. Mellman also points out that
Lasorda resumed traveling after undergoing a second angioplasty
during the 1996 National League Division series between the Dodgers
and Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Before taking over for Claire, Lasorda traveled extensively
throughout the Dodgers' minor-league system evaluating talent. He
also maintained his rigorous schedule of charity and motivational
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has bounced back well,'' Mellman said. ``A second and even
a third angioplasty is not uncommon, but Tommy appears to be past
all that. I am very pleased with the condition he is in. The road
can be a tough place, but Tommy has made some good adjustments in
his life.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Gonzalez on pace: Rangers outfielder Juan Gonzalez leads the
majors with 96 RBI in 81 games, 26 more than any other player in
the American League. Gonzalez has the second-most RBI in
major-league history before the All-Star break. Detroit's Hank
Greenberg had 103 in 76 games in 1935. After 81 games, Greenberg
had 108. Amazingly, he did not make the All-Star team, missing out
behind Lou Gehrig and Jimmie Foxx.
</P>
<P>
   The AL-record for RBI in a season is 184 by Gehrig in 1934. The
major-league record is 190 by Hack Wilson in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Right fielder Gary Sheffield accompanied the club
here after having the cut on his left eye examined before the 11
a.m. flight. Sheffield, injured in Sunday night's bench-clearing
brawl with Pittsburgh, has been cleared to play tonight....
Shortstop Jose Vizcaino underwent an MRI exam Monday on his
severely sprained right ankle. The test confirmed a ligament tear
and he will wear a soft cast for a week. Vizcaino, who complained
of increased swelling and pain in the ankle Sunday after appearing
to make progress, hopes to be back after the All-Star break.

FIRED TEACHER STUNNED AT CHURCH-STATE FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MACARENA HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Almost three weeks after she was fired for asking
children in her Bronx classroom if they had accepted Jesus as their
Saviour, Mildred Rosario says she is stunned to find herself at the
center of a national debate over the division between church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed Sunday at her pastor's office in her Pentecostal
church in East Harlem, Mrs. Rosario, 43, said she never expected
that her response to a student's question about a schoolmate's
recent death would cause such a furor. Discussion of her case has
moved from her principal's office to City Hall, where Mayor Rudolph
W. Giuliani spoke on her behalf, to Congress, where Rep. Tom Delay,
R-Texas, the majority whip, spoke in her favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I did was console my students,'' said Mrs. Rosario, who
was fired June 12 from her job as a sixth-grade bilingual teacher
at Intermediate School 74 in the Bronx. ``I answered my students'
questions and they have treated me worse than a criminal. I do not
regret what I did because God is going to give me the victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rosario, who lives in Manhattan, has filed a grievance with
her union, the United Federation of Teachers, challenging her
dismissal. On Friday, she and a union delegate met with a
representative of the superintendent's office to discuss her case,
and a union spokesman said Monday that a decision was expected this
week.
</P>
<P>
   She does not believe that what she did was wrong, she said. She
is aware of the school's policy against proselytizing, she said,
but feels obligated to talk about her faith when asked. ``To talk
about God is something else,'' she said. ``I did not talk about
religion. I don't know why the Board of Education is mixing one
thing with another. I respect all religions.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, Mrs. Rosario and her husband, Hector, sat
unnoticed in the third-to-last row of the small Pentecostal church,
Abrigo del Altisimo, which they have attended for three years. When
a congregant took requests for prayers, Mrs. Rosario was the last
to raise her hand. Unlike most congregants, who asked for prayers
for the ill or the needy, Mrs. Rosario did not say anything. But
after all the requests were in and the prayers began, the
congregant leading the prayer asked God to give strength to Mrs.
Rosario.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began when a student and her guardian complained
about Mrs. Rosario's leading her class in prayer, asking if anyone
wanted to accept Jesus and laying hands on some children.
</P>
<P>
   The principal, Leroy Johnson, saw her action as a clear-cut
violation of the ban on proselytizing by teachers. ``Mrs. Rosario
comes up as the martyr and here is this little girl who has
different beliefs and she is terrified,'' Johnson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As is her habit, Mrs. Rosario met her arriving students outside
the school the morning of June 8 and walked with them to the
classroom, she said. She had not yet taken attendance when the
principal asked over the intercom for a moment of silence in memory
of Christopher Lee, a fifth grader who had drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the first question, from Luisa Corporan, 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where is Christopher Lee?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``In heaven,'' Mrs. Rosario said she answered.
</P>
<P>
   Students followed with more questions about God and heaven. But
before proceeding, Mrs. Rosario said, she had announced that anyone
who did not want to listen could read a book or use the computers
in the back of the room.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving the complaint, Johnson scheduled a meeting the
following day with Mrs. Rosario, the girl and her guardian, who is
her sister-in-law. Mrs. Rosario said she asked them for
forgiveness, which they granted. She believes that the matter
should have ended there, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson asked Mrs. Rosario to write down her account of what
had happened in the classroom. She said she took the questioning
personally and felt that school officials were making fun of her
religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took away my job,'' she said. ``But the joy I feel inside
because I am saved and my name from the book of life, that they
can't take away.''

NRC GIVES FINAL APPROVAL TO RESTART OF REACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (lb) 
 By JONATHAN RABINOVITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ Millstone Unit 3, a nuclear reactor in
southeastern Connecticut, is scheduled to begin transmitting
electricity by Thursday after more than two years of being barred
from operating by federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The unit is the largest of three reactors at the Millstone
Nuclear Power Station, which the Nuclear Regulatory Commission shut
down in late 1995 and early 1996 because of safety concerns. While
the other two units still are not allowed to operate, the federal
commissioners gave a preliminary approval earlier this month for
Unit 3 to restart, and on Monday it received the commission's final
blessing.
</P>
<P>
   That decision is a marked turnabout from the plant's problems of
a few years ago, which produced a fine of $2.1 million, the largest
in the history of the U.S. nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast Utilities, the company that operates Millstone, was
forced to take steps to ensure that it would act upon workers'
safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's commission announcement comes at a critical moment for
Connecticut and western Massachusetts, which rely on Northeast
Utilities for most of their electricity. July is when demand for
power reaches its peak, and the utility's difficulty during last
week's heat indicated that it may have trouble meeting its
customers' needs without the electricity provided by Millstone.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Brothers, the Millstone Station vice president of
operations, said the Unit 3 reactor would be started Tuesday at
noon. It would take at least 24 hours to heat up enough to provide
electricity, but he added that the company planned to take it
``slow and easy'' and probably not start transmitting electricity
until Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, the unit will be at roughly 30 percent of capacity,
said Terrence McIntosh, a company spokesman. The reactor is not
expected to reach full power for two to five weeks, according to a
statement from Northeast Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of Northeast Utilities said Monday that federal
regulators were letting the reactor begin operating before all of
its problems had been resolved. They contended that the unit lacked
adequate fire prevention barriers and had flaws in the system that
detects damage to the nuclear core.
</P>
<P>
   But Diane Screnci, a federal commission spokeswoman, said the
agency had determined that the reactor could be operated safely
before it issued Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The approval was announced early Monday afternoon over the
public address system at the plant, and employees gathered in the
yard outside the unit to celebrate. Cake and coffee were served in
the cafeteria.

BOOMERS HAVE A NEW CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
Hello Muddah, 
Hello Faddah. 
Here I am at 
Camp Granada.'' 
!dtpost!!bold!_Allan Sherman, from his No. 2 hit song of 1963!off! 
!by1! By  Dave Shelburne  
!by2!Daily News Staff Writer !dlim!
<TEXT>
<P>
   In their youth, the early members of the baby boomer generation
might have spent their summers at some Camp Granada, scribbling
postcards to mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   Now charging into and through their 50s en masse, those same
front-rankers have hardly given up on camping because of a few
emerging wrinkles. They've just replaced a paddle and lake with a
golf club and water hazard, often in a spectacular location. And
they don't limit themselves to the summertime.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, baby boomers and others had the opportunity for
extended, comprehensive instruction on a near-year-round basis at
270 locations in 44 states, according to ShawGuides, which
publishes an annual listing of nationwide golf and tennis camps.
</P>
<P>
   More than 750 campers have gone through one- to three-day
schools since October at PGA West, where the Jim McLean Golf School
is enjoying booming business in its first full year of operation on
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a monster year there,'' said McLean, the 1994 PGA
teacher of the year who estimated another 5,000-6,000 golfers have
attended McClean School clinics at PGA West.
</P>
<P>
   Camp isn't cheap, even at summer-in-the-desert rates, which run
from $300 per person for a one-day school to $1,250 for the
three-day players school, which is the most popular and where
McLean students get to play on the course with their instructor two
of the three days.
</P>
<P>
   But, on a hourly basis, the cost of camp instruction is not a
whole lot more than golfers would pay over a similar period of time
in weekly lessons at their neighborhood driving range. And,
arguably, instruction in one chunk of time, offering the
opportunity for reinforcement and repetition under guidance, might
be a better investment than the newest mega-titanium,
Godzilla-sized driver _ or even a whole new set of woods and irons.
</P>
<P>
   Dorlene Kaplan of ShawGuides, which is conducting a reaction
survey of golf campers, said early response has been mostly
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most felt they came away with lasting results, and even the
ones who thought they didn't learn that much said they had a great
time,'' Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   Students at a recent three-day McLean camp seemed to like it.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Slinkard, owner of a manufacturers rep firm in Nashville,
was happy with the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facilities were awesome,'' he said. ``You had all the
quality practice balls you wanted. I think my pro could pick things
out in my swing just by glancing at it and tell me what I was doing
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Kolts of Danbury, Conn., who attended the same school,
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed with their ability in a very short period of
time to hone in on everybody's individual problem areas, or areas
where we needed improvement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McLean camps start with videotape analysis, in which the camera
shows the students the difference ``between feel and real,'' as
instructor Debra Chaumillon puts it. From that tape, instructors
zero in on specific areas _ the problems the students knew they had
and, often, ones the tape reveals to them for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of each school, students are shown an ``after'' tape
of themselves, often with notable improvement.
</P>
<P>
   McLean looks for instructors who not only can teach but can also
play the game. And they have to follow a basic philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be successful in a golf-school business, you have to have
all your instructors on the same page,'' he said. ``You just can't
be teaching different things and you can't confuse the student. But
there is a lot of room for individuality.'''
</P>
<P>
   All of his instructors look at a golf swing through its various
positions or steps. McLean is noted for his eight-step approach.
They find what's broken the most and fix it _ most of the time
without too much rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to have people work on their weakness, then help them
in those areas,'' said McLean, whose schools _ also based in
Florida and Michigan _ attract players of all levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim has a reputation for teaching tour players and good
players,'' said Greg Vincent, managing director of the McLean
Group. ``But the bulk of our business is teaching beginners and
higher-handicap players. In the last couple of years we've seen a
lot of beginners come into the game, and as golf schools have
become more popular, people realize that's a quick and easy way to
immerse themselves in the game.''
