REPUBLICAN DEBATE OVER GAY RIGHTS BILL TURNS PERSONAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The long-simmering debate over gay rights exploded in
the state Legislature on Wednesday during a hearing on whether the
state should continue to extend insurance benefits to same-sex
couples.
</P>
<P>
   The bitter exchange pitted Steve May, the only openly gay
Republican ever elected to the Legislature against Karen Johnson, a
hard-line archconservative known for her bat tles against abortion
and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, May, R-east Phoenix, demanded to know why he
should receive less protection under the law than Johnson,
particularly when he has a single partner and Johnson has been
married five times.
</P>
<P>
   The rancor of the debate illustrates the deep cultural divide
that exists even between those who come from the same party and
religious backgrounds.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, R-Mesa, said homosexual lifestyles are ``undermining
the natural family'' and threatening basic freedoms. Another
supporter, Rep. Barbara Blewster, compared homosexuality to
``bestiality, human sacrifice, and cannibalism'' in a letter to a
constituent.
</P>
<P>
   May called her a liar, but later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was the first to speak at a committee hearing on a bill
that would prohibit the use of tax money to pay spousal benefits
for unmarried couples and homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   But before long she launched into a diatribe against
homosexuality itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical to our national health and survival to restore
social virtue and purity to our state and nation,'' Johnson said.
``Is living together without the benefit of marriage good? Is
homosexuality good? If cohabitating and homosexual behavior is
detrimental to the individual and to society, besides breaking the
law, then society has the responsibility to resist it.''
</P>
<P>
   May had not planned to testify on the bill. But he erupted when
Johnson was done speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if these lies are born of ignorance, or bigotry,
or prejudice. . . . I am offended. I am disgusted. It is a lie.''
</P>
<P>
   May later said Johnson was on a ``medieval crusade'' and was
``spewing venom.'' He called her a tool of ``radical-right,
big-government theocrats.''
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, the argument turned from personal attacks to
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Cheuvront, D-central Phoenix, joined May in criticizing
the bill. Cheuvront is also openly gay.
</P>
<P>
   Cheuvront said it was ironic that the stongest supporters of the
bill are Mormons, who were once persecuted for polygamy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that the Mormons are trying to dictate their
morals on Arizona,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is Mormon, as are Reps. Dean Cooley, R-Mesa, Debra
Brimhall, R-Snowflake, and Wayne Gardner, R-Mesa, who voted for the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   May, too, was reared Mormon.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, May pointed out that Johnson has been married
five times.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tax dollars are supporting her fifth relationship,'' he
said. ``She's been using my tax dollars to support five husbands.
But she thinks it's wrong to spend tax money on my one partner.''
</P>
<P>
   He accused her of ``carrying water'' for Christian conservatives
such as Gary Bauer and James Dobson in an attempt to stir up
support for conservative groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, their best fund-raising tool is railing against
homosexuals. I resent being victimized for raising money for . . .
the Christian Coalition,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Johnson asserted that homosexuals suffer
from a variety of illnesses, including AIDS, gonorrhea, anal
carcinoma, and what she called ``gay bowel disease.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the life expectancy for a homosexual man with AIDS
is 39, while homosexuals who haven't contracted AIDS can expect
live to 42.
</P>
<P>
   May disputed those assertions as lies.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson added that it was wrong for taxpayers to pay additional
health-care costs caused by a promiscuous or homosexual lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the focus is kept on the medical consequences alone, moral
judgments against such behavior are overwhelmingly supported by the
best scientific data presently available,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a judgment does not proceed from prejudice or homophobia.
It is grounded in the concrete effects brought about by the kinds
of sexual acts in which gay, lesbians, bisexuals and promiscuous
heterosexuals often participate in.''
</P>
<P>
   When May responded, he attempted to explain his anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many members, I guess, expected me to stay in my office
quietly and don't understand why I would come out publicly and
oppose this ridiculous legislation. But when you attack my family,
and you steal my freedom, I will not sit quietly in my office. This
Legislature takes my gay tax dollars _ and my gay tax dollars spend
the same as your straight tax dollars. If you're not going to treat
me fairly, don't take my money.''
</P>
<P>
   A supporter of the bill suggested it was May, not Johnson, who
was lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexuals are known for telling lies and twisting the truth
and attacking and calling names those who would stand up and not go
along with their agenda,'' said Frank Meliti, chairman of the
Traditional Values Coalition of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, HB 2524, would prohibit state government,
including universities, from offering health benefits to the
unmarried partners of employees. County and city governments could
offer the benefits only after they were approved by the public at
the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would curb a growing trend of providing benefits to
same-sex couples. Tucson provides benefits to same-sex partners,
while Pima County covers both homosexual couples and unmarried
heterosexual couples.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly around the country, companies are extending
benefits to gay partners. One of out 10 organizations now offers
domestic partner benefits, a trend that is expected to continue,
according to a new Society for Human Resource Management
mini-survey report.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Southern Baptist Convention voted to boycott
products of the Disney Corp. because the company provides benefits
to gay couples.
</P>
<P>
   May argued that Republicans should focus on other topics like
education and avoid the divisive issue of gay rights. Some of his
colleagues agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``My party continues to circle the wagons and fire at will,''
said Rep. Carolyn Allen, R-Scottsdale. ``It's counterproductive,
and it's sad this took place today.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like Blewster, R-Dewey, say fighting homosexuality
should be a priority. In a letter to a constituent, Blewster argued
that homosexuality ``is a high sign of the downfall of the
nation.'' She continued that there is ``no joy in life without
taking on the responsibility of a wife and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Blewster defended the letter Wednesday, saying that a moral
climate needs to be re-established across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Morality is important no matter how much we want to think we
are too sophisticated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Brimhall explained her vote by saying she loved all people. But
she added, ``I find homosexuality disgustingly disturbing. This
calls God and his designs into question. I feel a strong sense of
fear for anyone who questions God's designs.''
</P>
<P>
   May, a freshman lawmaker who served in the Army after graduating
college, says government should butt out of personal lifestyle
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think I'm going to hell, and maybe that's the case,'' May
said. ``But why is my personal salvation the responsibility of the
Arizona Legislature?''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say the debate is emblematic of growing cultural tension
in the United States that is dividing religious conservatives from
a soci ety that is becoming more diverse and less influenced by
religious thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an attempt to hold on to those values associated with
rural America that came out of its Puritan past,'' said Bruce
Merrill, an ASU pollster and professor of journalism.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Religious conservatives) feel like they're under attack. In a
way they are: Society is changing. It's the underlying basis for
the Lewinsky thing. They can't do anything else. To them, these are
absolute values.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrill said religious conservatives will continue to raise
issues such as gay rights as demographic and cultural changes
weaken their political influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more multi-valued culture than the Puritan values
that directed this country for 200 years,'' Merrill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are desperately trying to hold on.'' &QL;

APACHE TRIBE CUTS OFF WATER TO PHELPS DODGE MINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The San Carlos Apache Tribe, rekindling an old and
bitter dispute with Phelps Dodge Corp., has shut off a pumping
station that supplies most of the water to one of the world's
largest open-pit copper mines and some of the water to a pair of
southeastern Arizona mining communities.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials confirmed Wednesday that they ordered federal
officials this week to close down the Black River Pump Station,
which sends water to Phelps Dodge's giant Morenci copper mine.
</P>
<P>
   The pump station also supplies some of the water to the
communities of Clifton and Morenci, although both towns have
independent sources of water.
</P>
<P>
   Apaches said federal Bureau of Reclamation workers did not
resist the order by tribal council members to stop operating the
pump on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The San Carlos Apaches had threatened many times to close the
pump, including in 1997, but had not followed through until now.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians said they took the action because Phelps Dodge has
refused to sign an agreement governing how water from the pump is
to be allocated between the Apaches and the mining company. They
need to be sure it will have enough water for the fish and wildlife
of the Black River, a tribal spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a matter of principle for the tribe, and it's not
trying to drive Phelps Dodge into some kind of crisis,'' Bill Byler
said Wednesday. ``But it never got this bad before.''
</P>
<P>
   H.M. ``Red'' Conger, president of Phelps Dodge Morenci Inc.,
said he could not predict how long the mine could operate with its
alternative water supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many variables in that, I'm just not going to
speculate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Clifton, Town Manager Tonya Williams said an extended
shutdown of the mine would be ``just devastating'' for the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mine's economy is our economy,'' said Williams, whose
husband and two sons work there. ``That's really the only thing up
here. It's not like we have something else to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge said that it could operate the mine in the
short-term using alternate water supplies, but that it did not know
how long the reserves would last.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton barber Edward Nabor said the water shut-off has
heightened employment anxiety already stirred by the collapse of
the international copper market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are worried, scared that their jobs are on the
line,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Velasquez Sneezy, tribal vice chairman, said federal officials
appealed to keep the pumps on, and were told by the tribe, ``The
answer is no.''
</P>
<P>
   The effects weren't felt immediately by Phelps Dodge because it
takes a few days for the water to flow south to Morenci. Water is
normally pumped out of Black River, a tributary of the Salt River,
and piped down Willow Creek into Eagle Creek until it flows onto
land owned by Phelps Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not at this point receiving any water through the Black
River Pump Station to the Morenci operation. We're drawing on some
alternate reserves,'' Lynne Adams, a Phelps Dodge spokeswoman, said
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've asked the United States (Interior Department) to turn
those pumps back on.'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   The water cutoff came in a 55-year-old water-rights dispute
between the tribe and Phelps Dodge over control of the pumps.
</P>
<P>
   Although the pump station sits on the reservation, it was long
operated by Phelps Dodge under a 1944 right-of-way issued by the
Interior Department. For many years, the tribe accused Phelps Dodge
of cheating the Apaches out of rental fees and of lying about how
much water it needed for the copper mine.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps Dodge left the reservation in 1997 under increasing
hostility from the tribe. Under an agreement approved that year by
Congress, the federal Bureau of Reclamation was to run the pumps
until the tribe could be properly trained to take over the station
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Conger said Phelps Dodge at the end of 1998 paid the tribe
nearly $5.7 million under the 1997 agreement. He said the money
included a $5 million partial prepayment for the 50-year life of
the agreement, $653,000 for water in 1999 and $35,000 for use of
tribal facilities. The federal government receives the payments for
the benefit of the tribe, Conger said. The agreement called for the
copper plant and the adjoining communities to get the water they
needed. But it would be Apaches operating the pumps instead of
Phelps Dodge workers.
</P>
<P>
   The latest problem arose because it appears the tribe and mining
company interpreted the 1997 agreement differently.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe says Phelps Dodge has refused to honor the tribe's
priority right to Black River water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribe has had a 50-year policy of not taking water out of
the river _ even for itself _ if it would decrease the flow below
20 cubic feet,'' tribal attorney Joe Sparks said.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks said Wednesday that Phelps Dodge has refused to sign a
proposed lease agreement that would enable the tribe to ensure that
the 50-year-old policy can continue.
</P>
<P>
   However, Phelps Dodge said Wednesday that it recognizes the
tribe's ``superior water right'' but that the tribe is trying to go
beyond the intent of the 1997 agreement by writing new water
guidelines.

COVER ARTICLE ON DAUGHTER IRKS CLINTONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, said on
Wednesday night that they were ``profoundly saddened'' by People
magazine's decision to run a cover article on their daughter,
Chelsea, in its next issue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither People magazine nor the White House would discuss the
article in detail on Wednesday night, although the magazine issued
a statement making it clear that the article, entitled ``Grace
Under Fire,'' is about Miss Clinton's relationship with her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great deal of admiration for this mother-daughter
relationship,'' Carol Wallace, the magazine's managing editor, said
in a recorded statement released by a spokeswoman. ``Over the
years, we have written about the White House in good times and
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Explaining its decision to feature the Clintons' daughter, Ms.
Wallace said Miss Clinton is ``nearly 19 and a poised young
adult.'' The statement said the magazine's editors consider her ``a
valid journalistic subject'' because she is a witness to a
continuing ``family drama'' and important historical events _ a
clear reference to the impeachment trial arising from the
president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at his home in Manhattan, a People executive editor,
Cutler Durkee, said he had not been involved in editing the article
and could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Mrs. Clinton issued a statement on Wednesday
night saying they ``deeply regret and are profoundly saddened'' by
the magazine's decision. For the six years of the Clinton
presidency, the statement said, the media have generally respected
their daughter's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, despite personal appeals with respect to her
privacy and her security from her parents, People magazine has
chosen to run the story,'' the statement said. ``We can only hope
that the media will continue its policy of restraint with respect
to our daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's spokeswoman, Marsha Berry, said on Wednesday
night that the article would make it ``very difficult'' for Miss
Clinton, now a student at Stanford University, to have a private
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's just trying to go to school, and she hasn't done
anything to draw attention to herself,'' Ms. Berry said.

DEVILS BEAT HURRICANES, 4-1 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. _ Devils Coach Robbie Ftorek reunited Patrik
Elias with Petr Sykora and Jason Arnott on Wednesday night for the
first time in several games, and the line combined for three goals
and three assists to lead New Jersey to a 4-1 triumph over the
Carolina Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   Sykora had two goals and assisted on a goal by Elias, who also
had an assist, as the Devils returned to their winning ways after a
loss to Nashville and then a tie with Detroit on Monday night in
New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lines have been changed a lot all year because of injury,
or we have so many guys that can play, you have to get people into
the lineup,'' Ftorek said. ``So we made a lot of changes because I
want to play guys and not get stale.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Brodeur, who made a number of spectacular saves against
Detroit, had another inspired performance in goal with 29 saves for
the Devils. He allowed only a power-play goal by Keith Primeau.
</P>
<P>
   Several players, as well as Ftorek, credited Brodeur for the
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marty was really good again,'' Denis Pederson said. ``You need
a goaltender like that to kill penalties like we did. We gave up a
power-play goal tonight, but we've been doing really well on the
penalty kill the last few games.''
</P>
<P>
   Primeau's score was the first power-play goal the Devils allowed
over the past 30 times in which they played a man short, spanning
eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Brodeur was particularly superb late in the second period, when
Bobby Holik took two penalties, and late in the third period, when
the Devils had to kill a penalty to Scott Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Brodeur's saves in the second period came from
point-blank range, on Robert Kron in the eighth minute and on Kent
Manderville in the 15th. Brodeur also had fine glove saves on Ray
Sheppard, Adam Burt and Glen Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the toughest were in the third, when they were coming
with speed and Primeau had a breakaway,'' Brodeur said of his
saves. ``I also got lucky when they disallowed that goal and
Sheppard hit the post.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolina had a goal by Marek Malik disallowed early in the third
period, when the Devils had a 2-0 lead, because Ron Francis was in
the crease.
</P>
<P>
   Elias opened the scoring with his eighth goal of the season, on
the Devils' first shot in the game, 5 minutes 31 seconds after the
opening face-off. It came from close range on the left after a pass
from the other side by Sykora, who took the puck away from Curtis
Leschyshyn in Carolina's zone.
</P>
<P>
   The goal by Elias held up until Sykora got his first of the
night, 75 seconds into the last period. After Primeau scored,
Krzysztof Oliwa had his fourth goal of the season and Sykora got
his second of the game and 16th of the season with 2:14 left.

RODMAN A BAD IDEA FOR LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ This just in: The Lakers are interested in Dennis
Rodman.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, President Clinton pledged his allegiance to
Promise Keepers, Sean Penn flew into town via Southwest Airlines to
promote his latest movie and Calista Flockhart is said to be
weighing a sweet endorsement deal with Mars candy. Snicker,
Snicker.
</P>
<P>
   The bare-bones truth? The Lakers need to add Rodman to their
roster about as much as Flockhart needs to lose another pound.
</P>
<P>
   We're not talking about a Chicago team loaded with veterans and
led by a vocal superstar. This is a young Lakers team with a lot of
growing up to do.
</P>
<P>
   You have center Shaquille O'Neal, who is no Michael Jordan when
it comes to goading his teammates into greatness.
</P>
<P>
   You have impatience personified in Kobe Bryant, who has yet to
be convinced that grand things can happen to those who come off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   And you have an unheralded starting point guard, Derek Fisher,
who is having to massage so many egos on a daily basis it's no
wonder his skin is becoming calloused.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing a team with an immature streak needs is to have
is the NBA's Peter Pan swoop in for a season. In the Lakers' case,
Rodman isn't the answer to their prayers for an NBA title, he's a
death wish.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on team executive vice president Jerry West for even
entertaining the thought of acquiring basketball's bad boy. This
was a story that should have had no legs _ like a lot of NBA
players will, come the fourth quarter of Friday's openers.
</P>
<P>
   West should have followed the cue of a growing segment of the
public at-large and simply ignored Rodman, the soon-to-be
38-year-old character-turned-caricature.
</P>
<P>
   Just because owner Jerry Buss likes Rodman _ you know what they
say about birds of a feather (or in this case, feather boa) _ it
doesn't mean West was under any obligation to pick up the telephone
and touch base with Rodman's agent.
</P>
<P>
   By acknowledging Wednesday that he had done so, West, wittingly
or no, telegraphed a distress signal to the team he has assembled
to challenge Utah and Houston and San Antonio and Portland for
Western Conference bragging rights in this shortened season:
</P>
<P>
   I love you. You're perfect. Now change.
</P>
<P>
   If West was wild about the team he had assembled, why would he
give a second thought to a guy who, last time anyone checked, was
hosting an all-night pre-Super Bowl bash in Miami with wife Carmen
Electra?
</P>
<P>
   That's one conditioning method we don't recommend to the kids at
home. It's surely not the one endorsed by 16-year veteran Derek
Harper, who reported to training camp in amazing shape. Then again,
West acquired Harper to help set an example for the younger Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   They can be quite a headache to deal with, the headstrong bunch
of individuals who wear the purple and gold.
</P>
<P>
   As far as providing relief, Harper acts like an aspirin. Rodman
would be more like a sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers were to wind up with Rodman, the shortened season
would provide the only real comfort, the concentrated schedule
providing fewer practice days for Rodman to kiss off in favor of
the casinos in Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman is a gamble for any team, though we understand the
temptation.
</P>
<P>
   His mastery of one of the NBA's lost arts is laudable, his place
in league history, unimpeachable. Rodman is the seven-time
defending rebounding champion, his average of 16.8 boards a game in
that span a testimony to his tenacity, timing and toughness.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls would have been hard-pressed to win their
third consecutive NBA title this past spring without Rodman.
Remember his 14 rebounds in a four-point Bulls win in Game 4 of the
Finals?
</P>
<P>
   That's the Rodman West wistfully described Wednesday; the
heads-up player with the boundless energy.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad Rodman can't suppress his id, because without that
there'd be no idiot. As it is, the last thing a Lakers team already
disposed to distraction needs is a casino-crawling, club-hopping,
cross-dressing clown.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 15 rebounds and $21,195 a game, that addition would be
no bargain at all. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the impeachment trial of President Clinton set
to reconvene on Thursday for what is likely to be its final phase,
House prosecutors favor bringing Monica Lewinsky to the Senate
floor, even though their chances of prevailing look dim.
</P>
<P>
   But several influential Republicans made it clear on Wednesday
that they were reluctant to call witnesses to appear in person in
the well of the Senate, amid signs that a number of Senate
Republicans were no longer rallying around the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors interviewed the last of three witnesses behind
closed doors on Wednesday, questioning Sidney Blumenthal, a senior
White House aide, for about an hour and fifteen minutes, excluding
breaks. They questioned Ms. Lewinsky for several hours on Monday
and Clinton's close friend Vernon Jordan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The way is now clear for several decisive votes, confronting
Senators with decisions as early as Thursday on whether to make the
videotapes of the depositions public and whether to allow the three
witnesses to be questioned once again, this time in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to have a verdict that will withstand the
test of history, these witnesses should come forward,'' said Rep.
James E. Rogan, R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But even Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., head of the House
prosecution team, sounded pessimistic about the chances that the
Senate would approve the request to question Ms. Lewinsky,
Blumenthal and Jordan in the well of the Senate. ``I haven't
received a world of encouragement, but I'm ever hopeful,'' Hyde
said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there were strong signs that a number of Senate
Republicans would oppose witnesses. Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska,
said: ``I'm not really for live witnesses. I think we took the
depositions for discovery, and I don't think anything's been
added.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said, ``I lean very very strongly
against any appearance by Monica Lewinsky.'' And Sen. Olympia J.
Snowe, R-Maine, said, ``I cannot personally forsee circumstances in
which we would call Monica Lewinsky or the other witnesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said: ``My inclination is to
support what the House finally requests. But I think the votes are
probably not there.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, in an effort to put the president in an
awkward position, more than two dozen Republican senators wrote to
Clinton to ask him to voluntarily testify in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your knowledge, intent, actions and omissions are central to
the charges the House of Representatives have made against you,''
the letter said. ``Personal answers from you should prove
beneficial in our effort to reconcile conflicting testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   While noting that ``it may be within the Senate's power to
compel your appearance,'' the senators said they were not
subpoenaing the president, a move some believe would be
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has steadfastly said that Clinton would not take
such a step and instantly rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Already looking toward the trial's conclusion, Senate Democrats
and the White House began a concerted campaign against a Republican
proposal to approve ``findings of fact'' accusing Clinton of
misconduct before taking the final vote on the two articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic efforts last week to end the trial showed that there
are not the 67 votes needed to convict Clinton on the charges of
perjury and obstruction of justice. But the statement of facts
could be approved with as few as 51 votes. Democrats contend that
the idea is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution gives the United States Senate the
opportunity to convict, remove or to acquit,'' said Sen. Robert G.
Torricelli, D-N.J., after a closed-door party caucus. ``The Senate
is not free to rewrite the Constitution and draw its own
conclusions because Republicans need to choose between an element
of their constituency that wants conviction and an American public
which wants acquittal.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Tom Daschle, the minority leader from South Dakota,
threatened that the Democrats would use the right of ``unlimited
amendment'' to keep the proposal from ever coming to a vote. ``If
Republicans persist in demanding live witnesses and demanding more
depositions and demanding extra legal devices like findings of
fact, the more it becomes a Republican trial,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House echoed the theme. Joe Lockhart, the White House
press secretary, said of the senators, ``As they move toward the
exits, they shouldn't try to trample on the Constitution in the
process.'' He also tried to allay the fears of Senate Republicans
that Clinton will celebrate his acquittal as a political victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a certain sense of relief here at the White
House if this process were to end quickly and go away,'' Lockhart
said. ``But I don't think that there's anybody here who thinks
anything out of this process constitutes a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe, who is a proponent of the fact finding, said the
procedures do pass constitutional muster. ``The significance of
finding of facts is it would be part of the permanent record of the
court of impeachment,'' she said. ``That would be, in my opinion,
indelibly etched in that record, and it could not be be erased and
it could not be revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``I think we do owe it to the American people to
inform them of the facts as we know them to be with respect to
misconduct or wrongdoing on the part of the president.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not clear that Republicans would coalesce around the
plan. Republicans said there was vigorous debate about it in a
closed door caucus Wednesday night, and they plan another meeting
Thursday morning. Some Republicans, too, have constitutional
concerns about the proposal, and some say they are worried that
such a finding would create a precedent that would encourage the
use of impeachment trials as political weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point at least, Republicans are not unified in favor
of that,'' said one Republican senator, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity. ``If that is still the case tomorrow, we probably
will not offer it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats favor a censure of the president after the trial
is concluded, and Daschle named Sens. Dianne Feinstein of
California and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York to develop the
language. Some Republicans are open to the idea, but other
Republicans have said they consider censure meaningless or
constitutionally suspect.

</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's questioning of Blumenthal, a communications aide who
is a bete noire of conservatives, took place in a secure room on
the fourth floor of the Capitol and was videotaped. Officials said
Blumenthal repeated his prior testimony to a grand jury that the
president had described Ms. Lewinsky to him as a ``stalker.'' Only
this time he had to concede that the president had lied to him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the session said Blumenthal stated that
he had never spread that description of Ms. Lewinsky to reporters
and that the president had not instructed him to do so. Blumenthal
was the last of three witnesses whom the House Republicans had
questioned in hopes of bolstering the article of impeachment
charging Clinton with obstruction of justice in his effort to cover
up his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. A second article accuses him of
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things the Senate will consider when the trial
resumes on Thursday is whether to put all or part of the three
witness depositions, on paper or on videotape, into the Senate's
public trial record. Hyde said the managers would ask that the
videotapes be publicized in a ``presentation'' to the Senate rather
than used in snippets on closing arguments. ``I think for
continuity's sake, we would like to have a presentation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Release of the videotapes would probably result in another media
blitz about the case since Ms. Lewinsky has never told her story in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, I think that it would be better left not
released to the public,'' said Daschle, questioning what the
release would add to the trial. But he said that if any part of the
tapes were to be made public, then the entire tapes should be
released. ``Our view is that if you're going to air a deposition,
you better air the whole thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the vote count was uncertain, the Senate seems more likely
to approve public release of the videotapes than to approve calling
witnesses to the Senate. John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, suggested that the
Senate could approve the public release of the depositions but keep
them under seal for a period of time.

INCREASING NUMBER OF SENATORS FAVOR PUBLIC DELIBERATIONS IN
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL  (See also IMPEACH-RDP, IMPEACH-BLUMENTHAL,(sw) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Support is growing in the Senate to suspend its
19th-century impeachment rules and allow public viewing of the
final deliberations on whether to remove President Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Senate rules require impeachment deliberations to be conducted
behind closed doors, and senators have soundly rejected two
attempts in the trial to open debate on procedural motions.
</P>
<P>
   But backers of a bipartisan measure say an increasing number of
Republicans and virtually all Democrats recognize the importance of
opening the final debate on acquitting or convicting the president.
</P>
<P>
   It would take two-thirds of the Senate, or 67 senators, to
change procedures drawn up in 1868 for the impeachment trial of
President Andrew Johnson. Both sides say a vote to suspend those
rules, which will likely happen next week, is too close to call.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the mounting support, traditionalists like Sen.
Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, a Democrat, and Sen. Ted Stevens
of Alaska, a Republican, both of whom voted to close debate on the
procedural motions, now favor opening the final deliberations. ``I
don't think the final arguments will change anyone's mind, so I see
no reason to close them,'' Stevens said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has
expressed skepticism about the proposal, but a senior Republican
aide said on Wednesday that Lott is now reconsidering the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say opening the final deliberations would set a bad
precedent, violate the American trial tradition of having jurors
deliberate privately, and unnecessarily prolong the trial because
all 100 senators would feel obliged to use their alloted 15
minutes. ``I don't believe the public would be denied anything
essential if the sessions are closed,'' said Sen. Mitch McConnell,
R-Ky.
</P>
<P>
   This debate illustrates a clash between age-old Senate
traditions and contemporary public demands for openness in
government and the realities of late 20th-century communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have come to expect more knowledge of their
government's decision-making process,'' said Sen. Kay Bailey
Hutchison, R-Texas, who is the proposal's main author.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison noted that her plan would not overturn Senate
precedent, but actually return to the tradition of open trials that
began with the impeachment of Samuel Chase, an associate justice of
the Supreme Court, in 1805 and ended with Johnson's proceedings 64
years later.
</P>
<P>
   The American public has been clamoring for a speedy end to the
trial, but there has been scant focus outside the Capitol about how
to conduct the senators' closing debate. In a Gallup poll last
month, those surveyed were equally divided on whether the Senate
should debate the impeachment issue in public or private.
</P>
<P>
   Twice in the trial, Sens. Tom Harkin of Iowa and Paul Wellstone
of Minnesota, both Democrats, asked the Senate to suspend its rules
and allow open deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   The first vote, to open debate on whether to dismiss the
charges, failed, 57 to 43. The second vote, to open debate on
whether to take depositions from three witnesses, was defeated, 58
to 41.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, senators said the closed sessions permitted a
candid and constructive discussion that allowed the Senate to forge
ahead with trial procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question, when you have the prying eye of the
camera and the outside world looking in, that affects the
dialogue,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., who supported closing
the debate on the procedural motions, but now wants to open the
final debate.
</P>
<P>
   Many other senators are undecided on the issue, having focused
this week on more immediate questions of whether to allow live
testimony or videotaped depositions in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made up my mind,'' said Sen. James M. Jeffords,
R-Vt. ``My instincts would say open it up, but tradition is to keep
it closed. The propensity of senators to want to maximize their
time adds a lot of hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of an open debate are pressing their case.
Hutchison has sent a letter to all her colleagues, reminding them,
``We are making history, and future generations, as much as our
own, deserve to know how we did so.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Last week, CNN asked the Senate and Chief Justice William H.
Rehnquist, who presides over the trial, to open all proceedings,
arguing that to do otherwise violated the First Amendment. The
18-page brief was laced with references to the ways in which the
First Amendment and the media had evolved since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only during this century has our commitment to the principle
that debate on public issues should be open become not merely a
nationally shared philosophy but an element embedded in
constitutional law,'' the brief said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society in 1868 _ and more significantly still, our law in
1868 _ was far different than it is today,'' the brief said.
``First Amendment jurisprudence as we know it _ as it governs and
binds the Senate _ is essentially a creature of the 20th century.
That jurisprudence assures public scrutiny, not public ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has changed, too: senators who voted on the 1868
impeachment were selected by state legislatures; since 1913 they
have been elected by popular vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of opening the debate dismissed the notion that
senators should be treated like normal jurors. The identities of
these 100 jurors are well known, as their votes will be. The
senators face no constitutional protections against public reaction
to their votes. Senators face the approval or rejection of the
voters the next time they seek re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'd be a mistake to close the final debate,'' Hagel said.
``It would cast too much of a cloud of suspicion. I say, throw the
doors open and let the American people hear it. Maybe it would be a
little cleansing tonic to run through the gears here.''

CAN LAKERS WIN IT ALL?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The opening of the NBA season is a bit like that
dreaded annual family reunion for the Lakers. They're the awkward
14-year-old boy who walks into the room, feeling all grown up and
proud, only to have Aunt Martha shatter the illusion with a
two-handed pinch of the cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Lakers return to the NBA another year older and feeling
a year wiser. But like that gawky 14-year-old trying to survive
puberty, they are an unfinished work of nature, still hoping not to
get stuck sitting at the kids' table.
</P>
<P>
   It was only last May, after all, that the Lakers were getting
spanked by their elders, dealt a 4-0 sweep by the seasoned Utah
Jazz in the Western Conference finals. The NBA lockout was long,
but not nearly long enough to erase the sting and embarrassment of
that defeat.
</P>
<P>
   So now the Lakers return, a slightly changed group and perhaps a
more mature one for the experience. They certainly hope so. The
annual ritual of being dubbed the league's most talented team, only
to finish the season tagged as too immature to win it all, is
getting old.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, we read and we listen,'' said guard Derek Fisher.
``We know how certain people feel about us. And not only are we
tired of it ourselves, but I think it's a natural human reaction to
want to prove other people wrong. I think that's where we are right
now. Sometimes that's what it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again a favorite to win the Western Conference, and
possibly the NBA championship, the Lakers re-enter the fray in this
lockout-shortened season with only subtle changes from the team
that was so badly outclassed in the 1998 conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Van Exel's testy attitude is gone; Derek Harper and his 15
years of NBA experience take his place. Travis Knight, a skilled
young forward, is back to add depth but certainly isn't the missing
piece to a championship puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, barring a last-minute move to gamble on Dennis Rodman,
the Lakers will rely almost solely on their own maturation process
to get past old hurdles, namely the Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence that process has taken place. From the brief
training camp in Santa Barbara to the daily practices the last two
weeks, the Lakers have shown a new commitment to working toward a
title, rather than just expecting one based on their talents alone.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Del Harris, often quick to criticize his players,
concluded training camp with the assessment, ``It's been the best
attitude among our practices here the five years I've been in Los
Angeles, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't alone in that feeling. Players cite a more
competitive atmosphere, and maybe it's the removal of Van Exel and
the tension he had with Harris. Or maybe it's the presence of
Harper, a tough-talking, no-nonsense leader who commands the
respect no one else did. Or maybe it's the presence of three
energetic rookies, including one, Ruben Patterson, who seems
hell-bent on proving something the second calisthenics begin.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe that six-month lockout simply gave the Lakers six
months longer to reflect and grow up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It starts with us looking in the mirror, with each of us, how
accountable we are to ourselves, and really asking ourselves the
question, how committed we are to working this out all the way to
the end,'' said forward Rick Fox. ``Because with that comes
sacrifices of individual honors and individual games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a question a player will ask himself at the beginning
of the season.... And if you've got a group of guys that never ask
that question to themselves, you've got a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In talent and skill, the Lakers are much the same as they were.
Their starting five hasn't changed. At their core is Shaquille
O'Neal, the game's most dominant center, and Eddie Jones, an
All-Star guard and defensive gem. Their small forward is the
do-it-all Fox and their point guard is now Fisher, less experienced
and less of a scoring threat than Van Exel but probably more
reliable. Robert Horry, a small forward in stature, will again play
as a converted power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Their shortcomings, then, are also the same as they were. The
Lakers lack a true power forward who can rebound and bang with Karl
Malone (thus the interest Tom Gugliotta, whom they failed to get,
and Rodman, whom they might still obtain). They have no ace spot-up
shooter in the rotation, and their best pure shooter is a rookie
(Sam Jacobson) who won't get many minutes. And without Van Exel,
the Lakers lack the kind of player who will make the game-winning
shot with the clock running down.
</P>
<P>
   But their bench is one of the deepest in the league, with Kobe
Bryant, Elden Campbell and Harper. And while the Jazz and Houston
Rockets have grown older, the Lakers believe they have grown wiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that beat us last season was execution,'' Bryant
said. ``People are talking about the mindset of the team, the
maturity of the team. The fact of the matter is, veteran teams
execute (plays). Because they've been in the league.... they focus
on execution, they pay attention to detail. Us as a young team, we
haven't done that. That's why we've been losing. Utah executed us
right off the court.... That's what maturity means to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Slightly retooled, motivated by their own shortcomings, still
loaded with the best talent money can buy, the Lakers once again
eye a title run. Their elders taught them a lesson to end 1997 and
'98. Now it's up to the young Lakers to prove they learned that
lesson.
</P>
<P>
   So have they?
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we get put in that situation, the playoff situation, I
don't know,'' Bryant said. ``Maybe against Utah in the Western
Conference finals. Then you'll know.''

Wednesday evening, and coach Paul Hackett was already busy making
references to next year's recruiting class.
</P>

   His first full year of recruiting completed, Hackett is eager to
keep plugging holes, and the most conspicuous absence among the 21
recruits who signed national letters of intent Wednesday was a
running back.

   For the first time since 1995, Tailback U. did not sign a

   ``It sets the stage for the most important recruit for 2000 to
be a running back,'' Hackett said. ``We have to go out and recruit
the top running back in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   USC tried to sign several running backs, including Joe Weber
(Texas A&AMP;M), Onterrio Smith (Tennessee) and Charles Drake
(Michigan), but came up short with each player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have felt from the very beginning we were in a tough battle
for Joe Weber,'' Hackett said. ``He chose to go away and there's
not a heckuva lot you can do about it. Joe Weber was a key guy for
us. What we didn't want to do, though, was recruit just another
running back.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Hackett, the Trojans did much better filling
other positions. They were ranked anywhere from eighth to 14th
nationally by the major recruiting services, which was slightly
higher than last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also did a good job meeting last year's No.1
priority: linemen.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a last-minute windfall, USC signed five offensive
linemen after securing commitments from Lucas MacKay and Eric
Torres on Tuesday. The Trojans also signed All-American defensive
tackle Bernard Riley of Los Alamitos and his highly regarded
teammate, tackle Sagan Atuatasi.
</P>
<P>
   ``The addition of Luke and Eric right at the end... that really
makes a difference,'' Hackett said. ``We think Bernard Riley can be
an instant impact player.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hackett had hoped to sign between 10-12 linemen, so he still
feels shortchanged in that department.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't sign five more each of the next two years, you can
have a setback,'' Hackett said. ``I wanted as many as 10 linemen.
Maybe our pool of people was too shallow. I would have loved seven
defensive linemen and five offensive linemen.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hackett gains more experience recruiting, he's also learning
a few lessons. One of them is that USC's efforts to increase its
nationwide recruiting might have been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans signed just three players from outside California,
and only one player (kicker David Newbury) from Texas, where they
had made a major push. They also got shut out in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had said I wanted to work nationally. That is a
disappointment. How we performed nationally is not what I thought
it would be,'' Hackett said. ``We're not going to change. I don't
think one year is a true gauge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very disappointed we didn't get two or three more people
from out of state. (Texas) was one of the biggest eye-openers. That
was tough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans did well in California, however, and have at least
seven players (linebacker Markus Steele, Riley, Newbury, cornerback
Darrell Rideaux, and wide receivers Marcell Allmond, Kareem Kelly,
Steve Stevenson) that are considered potential starters by the
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you look at the class, you've got to look at
Markus Steele,'' Hackett said. ``He has the kind of range that
Chris (Claiborne) had. He plays with great intensity. He's a great
blitzer. We'll start him at the outside linebacker position but he
could play middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the wide receiver group is premier. I'm going to be
accused of being a part-time track coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly (200 meters), Rideuax (100 meters) and Allmond (110
hurdles) all won state titles at last year's track championships,
while MacKay is one of the top throwers in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: The Trojans lost cornerback Nijrell Eason of Long Beach
City College on Wednesday. Eason, who verbally committed last week,
signed with Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive lineman Norman Katnik of Foothill in Santa Ana may not
enroll until next spring, although it still hasn't been decided,
Hackett said.

   &UR; !text! &LR; Threatened with the loss of their cherished right to
vote on Olympic host cities, International Olympic Committee
members in Lausanne, Switzerland, on Wednesday expressed deep
resistance to sweeping reforms to the bidding process proposed by
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   During a hastily organized private breakfast attended by 41 IOC
members, in town for a world summit on drugs and sports, many
complained to top Olympics officials that the reforms sought by
Samaranch were indiscriminate and unnecessarily harsh.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of emotional and sometimes bitter exchanges between
IOC members and the committee's executive board, the members argued
that innocent members were being unfairly punished for the abuses
of their colleagues, said IOC members who attended the closed-door
breakfast.

don't tell us the whole general assembly is corrupt,'' said Italian
IOC member Mario Pescante.

HEAVEN HELP YOU, RICK NEUHEISEL, WARN THE FOES OF WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jim Lambright had this annoying habit of walking
through the University of Washington's figurative yard and stepping
on rakes, repeatedly bonking himself on the head.
</P>
<P>
   Although it amused small children, the football coach's
carelessness was an embarrassment to athletic director Barbara
Hedges and others on campus. So they fired him, and picked up all
the rakes.
</P>
<P>
   Then they made the controversial hire of Rick Neuheisel, and
what happens?
</P>
<P>
   BONK!
</P>
<P>
   Neuheisel's first significant moment as Husky coach raised a
knot on his brow at least as ugly as any spotted on Lambright. In
addition to recruiting a sub-mediocre class, Neuheisel was caught
in an NCAA violation and accused of tampering by his former
employer.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to Seattle, Rick. Tried any of our banana-slug lattes?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for him, judgment on the worthiness of Neuheisel's
$1-million-a-year contract must await a season or two of actual
football. If it were based on letter-of-intent day, Gary Pinkel
might be getting a call from Seattle saying, ``Can we talk again?''
</P>
<P>
   Claiming ignorance of the law, Neuheisel owned up Wednesday to a
violation Sunday when he sent five assistants to visit recruits at
home. In 1995, the NCAA adopted a rule that confined recruiting
contact on the Sunday before letter day to campus visits.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in his four years at Colorado, his recruiting work
had already buttoned up by the final Sunday. But the compressed
schedule caused by his abrupt arrival at Washington pushed him
unknowingly into a forbidden zone.
</P>
<P>
   Although he claimed not to know of the violation until he was
called by a high school coach Monday morning, he reported the
violation to UW compliance director Ralph Bayard, who told the
Pac-10. This sort of self-reporting is lauded by the conference and
often results in less time standing in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a mistake,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   The official version sounds plausible _ too much work in too
little time, an honest mistake, self-reporting, public confession.
The proper response to carelessness. Unless a rival recruiter can
establish Washington gained an improper advantage, the Huskies
likely will suffer no more punishment than an order to go to bed
without dinner.
</P>
<P>
   It is the other allegation that holds more intrigue. Bayard said
that his counterpart at the University of Colorado distributed a
letter Jan. 28 across much of the college football nation claiming
that Neuheisel called his former players at Colorado and encouraged
them to transfer to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   If the charge proves true, it could be a major violation and the
NCAA tanks would surround the Tubby Graves building until Neuheisel
and his staff came out with their hands up.
</P>
<P>
   While Neuheisel steadfastly denied what he called ``falsehoods''
spread about his phone work, he did acknowledge making calls. But
he claimed the calls merely wished good luck to the players he had
come to know and enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, he was the Washington coach at the time. NCAA rules
say there can be no talk between a coach and players from different
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA rulebook is a Bermuda Triangle of bureaucratic
sophistry and hypocritical supermorality in which a number of
coaches have ventured, never to return. Having said that,
Neuheisel, Hedges and all of their peers are willing signatories to
the silliness, so they can't argue. They are their own rules.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the Colorado claims are true _ Bayard said no specific
incidents were described in the letter _ awaits further
investigation. Without saying so directly, Neuheisel, Bayard and
presumably the rest of the Husky athletic honchos are furious with
what they perceive as a scurrilous personal attack against
Neuheisel for the grief he caused by taking the UW job after he
said he had no interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insulted? Yeah,'' said Bayard. ``I responded (by letter to
Colorado) to that effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Bayard's feeling illuminates a matter that doesn't need a ruling
from the NCAA: When a school engages in the business of coaching
piracy, there are consequences beyond the change of nameplates on
the door.
</P>
<P>
   While Neuheisel can't be condemned for taking a better job,
neither can folks at Colorado be denied their anger over being
jilted and/or misled. Nor can Northwestern be faulted for wishing
locusts upon Boulder for CU's abrupt hijacking of its coach, Gary
Barnett.
</P>
<P>
   It's big-time college sports at its seamiest. While the ruthless
cycle is an annual event, this particular episode has potential for
high smarminess because of the continuing contempt for Neuheisel in
Colorado, as well as the national anger directed at Washington for
warping the salary scale by paying a young coach big money for his
potential instead of past achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder how Lambright is feeling this morning?

BEVERLY HILLS WANTS FURS TO CARRY DEATH NOTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif _ ``I love it,'' said Rebecca Witjas, a
ballet instructor from Malibu, as she stood before a mirror,
admiring a full-length spotted lynx coat she was trying on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it wears me, it's so huge,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Witjas' enthusiasm dimmed when told that furs sold in
Beverly Hills could soon carry a tag saying: ``Consumer notice:
This product is made with fur from animals that may have been
killed by electrocution, gassing, neck breaking, poisoning,
clubbing, stomping or drowning and may have been trapped in
steel-jaw, leg-hold traps.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, I think that's really reasonable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So goes the latest controversy in Beverly Hills, where the City
Council voted 3 to 1 with one abstention on Tuesday to place a
referendum on the May 11 ballot asking voters to decide whether fur
coats sold here should carry such a warning. If approved by voters,
national animal rights groups say, it could be the first such law
in the country. A group of residents and volunteer activists
gathered more than 3,300 signatures supporting the measure, which
also drew the backing of the actor Jack Lemmon.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has been framed more in terms of truth-in-labeling
than the ethics of luxury. The group backing the measure, Beverly
Hills Consumers for Informed Choices, produced a secretly recorded
videotape of salespeople telling people posing as customers that
the animals were put down humanely, rather than mentioning some of
the more gruesome ways in which they can be killed, said Luke
Montgomery, the campaign manager for the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a product that costs thousands of dollars, and the
point we're making is, whether it's deliberate deception or
misinformation, the consumer has the right to decide,'' Montgomery
said.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Kaplan, the president of the Fur Association of Southern
California, denied that fur retailers hid the information or
intentionally misled people and said the videotape had been edited
to take comments out of context.
</P>
<P>
   The fur retailers have an ally on the City Council: Though the
vote placing the issue on the ballot was a formality, Mayor Less
Bronte voted against it. In an interview, he said the labels could
harm the city's reputation.

TRAGEDY INTERSECTS WITH ENNIS PLAYER'S BIG DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACEY FEDUCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The telephone at Vera Hawkins' home would not stop ringing.
</P>
<P>
   ``How is Veronica? We heard she'd been hit by a car; is she all
right? How is Quentin? Was he hurt in the accident? What about the
people in the other car?''
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, there was no telephone in Vera Hawkins' home. It
was a luxury for a family attempting to recover from a fire almost
two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was an anomaly that her son, Ennis High School defensive back
Quentin Brown, would go through college recruiting season without
that ubiquitous link to coaches. He made do, though, by talking to
schools from Ennis coach Sam Harrell's office until the family
could afford to have its own line installed a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   After Arkansas revoked an offer, and New Mexico's interest
vanished with a coach transfer, Brown had finally secured a visit
to Tulane on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was his chance to be the first in his family to go to
college.
</P>
<P>
   He took his mother to work that morning, then went home to get
his 9-year-old twin sisters, Monica and Veronica, ready for school.
He dropped them off on his way to class.
</P>
<P>
   The telephone at Ennis High School rang.
</P>
<P>
   Veronica had been hit by a pickup truck. Quentin rushed out to
get his mother and meet the ambulance at the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   En route, a car entered an intersection from a stop sign.
Quentin slammed on the brakes and started to skid, unable to avoid
the collision. The air bag deployed in his face. The other car
started to spin, throwing a child, who was not wearing his seat
belt, from the back seat.
</P>
<P>
   The child died Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RThe car\S was just there,'' Quentin said. ``It just happened
so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Vera Hawkins arrived at the emergency room to find Veronica with
a broken leg and Quentin with bruised ribs. The college trip would
be canceled.
</P>
<P>
   He was disappointed, but was it OK to feel that way, knowing
that another child would not have the same opportunity?
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't talk about it too much,'' Vera Hawkins said. ``We've
been talking to him and telling him it wasn't his fault that it
happened. I just thanked God that nothing serious happened to my
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The telephone rang at Vera Hawkins' home.
</P>
<P>
   Tulane coaches called to see how Quentin was feeling. Coaches
from South Carolina called, as well. Questions about his health
yielded to questions about where he would decide to go to school.
The call Tuesday morning from Tulane yielded a scholarship offer,
sight unseen, and Quentin Brown had a decision to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was getting phone calls all day and all night,'' Quentin
said yesterday. ``I couldn't go to sleep because I was thinking
about where I was going to go and what I was going to do. I was
really confused. I guess I'm really relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   A telephone rang at Tulane yesterday, informing coaches that
Ennis defensive back Quentin Brown had signed a letter of intent to
play college football there.
</P>
<P>
   Some things, however, a phone call can't cure.

ALL-AMERICAN PARADE LEADS TO UCLA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A cornerback has not passed the SAT and there is
no punter. Otherwise, it's tough to find fault with UCLA's 1999
football recruiting class _ the consensus choice as No.1 in the
Pac-10 and one of the top-five nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the dominant program in the West, UCLA can be selective,''
said SuperPrep Magazine recruiting guru Allen Wallace, who rated
UCLA's class No.5 in the nation. ``The Bruins had a super effort
with an eye towards elite talent.''
</P>
<P>
   The 20-man class features 10 defensive players and five Parade
All-Americans: Venice quarterback J.P. Losman; San Jose linebacker
Marcus Reese; offensive lineman Shane Lehmann (Corona) and Bryce
Bohlander (Salem, Ore.); and Westlake tight end Mike Seidman, whom
UCLA coach Bob Toledo called ``the plum of the class.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a prototype NFL tight end,'' Toledo added. ``He's exactly
what we're looking for. They're hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after landing the nation's top-rated class, UCLA signed
either the No.1 or No.2 player in California at eight positions:
Seidman, Losman, Reese, Lehmann, Monrovia tailback Akil Harris,
Newhall receiver Jerry Owens, Fresno cornerback Ricky Manning and
Anaheim kicker Nathan Fikse.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got top-20 players nationally at every position,'' said
Student Sports Magazine's Brentt Eads. ``There's great balance.
From the quarterback to the kicker, they got a stud.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the horses on the track. Now they have to get them
saddled and headed in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Another way to judge UCLA's performance is by the small number
of coveted players it did not sign: Los Alamitos defensive tackle
Bernard Riley (USC), Seattle tailback Paul Arnold (Washington),
Glendale (Az.) defensive end Norman Boebert, and Concord cornerback
Atari Callen.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Bruins landed all the regional players on their
most-wanted list. Longtime observers believe the 1998 and 1999
recruits are UCLA's best back-to-back classes in at least a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to put building blocks on top of each other,''
Toledo said. ``I think we're building that foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike last year's frenetic signing day, when Justin Fargas and
DeShaun Foster kept the suspense high, the Bruins had no
last-minute drama. Their commitments were secured weeks in advance,
with the exception of Seidman and Harris, the Monrovia tailback who
initially committed to Colorado but changed his mind after coach
Rick Neuheisel bolted for Washington.
</P>
<P>
   With Foster, Jermaine Lewis and Keith Brown returning, UCLA kept
its tailback list short. Harris saw the depth chart and did not
flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an example of true recruiting clout,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   Losman was the first player to commit, accepting Toledo's
scholarship offer during a one-day camp in June. He is expected to
graduate early from Venice H.S. and enroll for spring practice,
where he'll compete with four returnees for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a specimen,'' Toledo said. ``I haven't seen a high school
guy throw the ball like him since John Elway. We don't have a guy
in the program with his arm strength. There are guys in the NFL who
don't throw the ball like him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' priorities were cornerback, kicker and punter. They
signed two cornerbacks, Manning and Gardena's DaShaun McCullough,
who has not attained a qualifying score on the SATs. They signed
Fikse, the top-rated kicker in the west. But they failed to sign a
punter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a punter in the program, and I'm concerned,''
Toledo said. ``We're talking to guys about possibly walking on.
We're taking all comers.''
</P>
<P>
   Note: The Bruins have one scholarship available. They are
recruiting Harvard-Westlake's 300-pound junior, Alex Holmes, who is
petitioning for college eligibility. Holmes played tight end at
Harvard-Westlake but is expected to play defense in college.

RANGERS COULD LAND PUERTO RICO SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ The Rangers, whose roster of Latin-American
players is appealing, appear to be the No. 1 candidate to
participate in the first regular-season series played in Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, Major League Baseball's executive director of
baseball operations, acknowledged yesterday the possibility of
regular-season games being played this season in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Alderson, though, declined to identify the organizations being
discussed for such consideration. However, The Associated Press
reported the Rangers' three-game series scheduled for May 10-12
with the Chicago White Sox at Comiskey Park could be moved to San
Juan, according to unidentified officials in the commissioner's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Those officials consider the possibility of the series being
moved to Puerto Rico as a 50-50 proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers president Tom Schieffer and White Sox general manager
Ron Schueler, though, lack any knowledge of Major League Baseball's
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard anything about it,'' Schieffer said. ``No one
has contacted us about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres scheduled their April 4 home opener against
the Colorado Rockies to be played in Monterrey, Mexico, and Major
League Baseball continues to consider a proposal that would allow
the Seattle Mariners to open the 2000 season in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer acknowledged why the Rangers might be viewed as an
attractive draw in Puerto Rico: Juan Gonzalez, the two-time
American League Most Valuable Player, seven-time All-Star Ivan
Rodriguez and infielder Luis Alicea, all Puerto Ricans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd certainly be glad to talk to people about it,'' Schieffer
said, ``but no one has asked us to do that.''

ROCK PIONEER REMEMBERED
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the 40th anniversary of Ritchie Valens death,
his aunt Ernestine Reyes paid a quiet visit Wednesday to his grave
to honor the Pacoima native, a rock pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hurts, but not as much as it hurt in the beginning,''
said Reyes, who was joined by several other relatives at San
Fernando Cemetery. ``Now we think more about helping other people
remember him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory of Valens has remained strong across the San Fernando
Valley and elsewhere since his death on Feb. 3, 1959, at age 17, in
a plane crash that also took the lives of Buddy Holly and J.P.
``The Big Bopper'' Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives reported that the 40th anniversary brought a
larger-than-normal crowd to the small Iowa town.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes' guitar-playing son, Ernie, sang and played in the
traveling concert that stopped at most of the ballrooms and concert
halls that Valens, Holly and Richardson visited during their
ill-fated ``Winter Dance Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He sounds just like Ritchie,'' Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the big effort to preserve Valens' memory is the
drive to get him inducted to the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Valens' relatives, friends and his record label cleared a major
hurdle last summer when their postcard campaign boosted Valens to
the 15-member nomination list for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Class of 1999 was announced in November, Valens
hadn't made the final cut, which included Bruce Springsteen, Billy
Joel and Paul McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Keane, who was Valens' manager at Del-Fi Records, hopes to
hear better news this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been yelling at them for years,'' Keane said. ``I think
they're just starting to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to Valens' home, relatives said their annual birthday
celebration is set for May 8 at Ritchie Valens Recreation Center in
Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   Since Valens became eligible for a Hall of Fame nomination in
1983, his popularity has clearly been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Bamba,'' a major motion picture about the young Latino
singer born Richard Valenzuela, came out in 1987. He received a
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990. A commemorative stamp
was released in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But his life ended as his career began _ Valens was on his first
major tour when he died _ leaving a far smaller catalog than other
nominees who had decades to put a body of work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I've heard that's holding him back is that he was
only around for nine months,'' Keane said. ``Considering what he
did in those nine months, I would think it's all the more reason to
put him in the Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes and other relatives placed flowers on his grave, played
his songs on a small boom box. They noted that the parties
surrounding Valens' birthday and the date of his death have been
getting bigger and bigger over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest celebration ever, they hope, will come before the
end of 1999. ``My last wish is that they put him in the (Rock 'n'
Roll) Hall of Fame,'' said Ernestine Reyes, Valens' aunt. ``That's
going to be the biggest party of all.''

STARS' DAVE REID NEVER GOES OUT OF STYLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ All you really need to know about Dave Reid is
he owns two 1979 Volkswagen Beetle convertibles.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe that's not all you need to know, but it's a good
start.
</P>
<P>
   Reid is a lot like his Beetles: simple, hard-working and
reliable. In many ways, he's the Volkswagen of NHL players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the type of player who can give us strong skating and
physical, defensive play,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``I
don't even think it's necessary to score that many goals from that
position, at least not for us. What he gives us there is
consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Reid's numbers certainly aren't Corvette-like. He has three
goals and seven assists and is even on his plus-minus rating. But
he has been in the lineup for 44 of 47 games, and he's not giving
Hitchcock any reason to take him out. That wasn't the case in
training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had to prove himself to us all over again, and he's done
that,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid played in only five of the Stars' 16 playoff games last
season, sitting out primarily because of a nagging injury that
hampered his lower back and hips. Reid, 34, tried to play through
the pain, but he says he knew it effected his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I wasn't playing, I was getting it worked on, and it
was killing me,'' Reid said. ``It just became something that
wouldn't allow me to even work out properly.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, doctors told him it would be a chronic problem that
could bother him for the rest of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told them, `No, it wouldn't be,' '' Reid said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid stayed away from weight lifting and concentrated on aerobic
activities for much of the summer; he came into training camp at
the lowest level of body fat he has been at in some time. That
allowed him to fend off the younger legs of Jason Botterill, 22,
and Jamie Wright, 22, two players who were competing with Reid for
a left-wing spot on the third or fourth line. Both Botterill and
Wright are with the Stars' minor-league affiliate, the Michigan
K-Wings, and Reid has also defended his territory against veterans
Dan Keczmer and Brent Severyn.
</P>
<P>
   But Reid knows with 35 games remaining in the regular season and
the most important games ahead in the playoffs, he has to be ready
to perform every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like it used to be, where you could have a little
slump or something,'' he said of a career in which he was a solid
lock as a lineup regular for the Boston Bruins and Toronto Maple
Leafs. ``Now, I can't afford to have two bad games, because I'll be
out of the lineup. And it's hard to prove yourself while you're
sitting in the press box.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said he sees that motivation in Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's living day to day, and that's the way he has to live,''
Hitchcock said. ``He's playing with more strength on the puck and
more jump; his recovery or reload time is better. He knows the
things he has to do to be a better player, and he's doing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of the same way he's learning the simplistic beauty of the
inner workings of a Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to learn, and you have to adjust, and you have to go
forward,'' Reid said. ``I think I learned a lot from last year.
Now, I'm healthy, and I'm getting a chance to play, and I think
that's showing up. I do have more confidence in my game, I know
that even if I get taken out of the lineup, I still know I can
play. And that's a big step forward.''
STAYING FIT
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock worked the Stars out for 90 minutes on the ice
yesterday, part of the team's conditioning as they play one game in
a 10-day span. Hitchcock said he expects to have similar-length
workouts during the next week. The Stars typically work out on ice
for 45 to 60 minutes a day.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Stars center Joe Nieuwendyk, who said he might rest his right
knee after recovering from tendinitis, went through the entire
workout. ``He just seems to get stronger,'' Hitchcock said. ``He
was one of our best players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have blown some third-period leads recently, but they
have been strong in protecting leads throughout the season. They
have only outscored teams 37-36 in the third period, but the Stars
are 22-1-4 when leading after two periods and 8-1-2 when tied after
two periods. They are 12-2 in one-goal games.

BC NO MATCH FOR ND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; SOUTH BEND, Ind. _ From the moment the Voices of Faith gospel
group sang out their last round notes of ``The Star-Spangled
Banner'' before a crowd of 2,617 in Joyce Center, it was obvious
Boston College didn't have much of a prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Notre Dame, the No. 6 women's basketball team in the
country, was playing too well to be stopped Wednesday night. Far
from it. Shooting just 38 percent, the Irish were stoppable at
virtually every tentative turn. Every sloppy pass. Every bad shot.
Or so it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   It's just that Boston College couldn't stop them. And so it was
that the No. 20 Eagles came out losers, 74-59, in a game that,
examined piece by piece, looked winnable. Until you looked at its
entirety.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have such balance,'' said BC coach Cathy Inglese. ``They
have kids who can drive to the outside, they've got three kids who
are a threat from the 3-point line, they've got the big one inside.
So even though they're having a bad shooting night, you couldn't
just sag everybody in on Riley. You had to be honest with all their
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley is center Ruth Riley, the team's leading scorer (17.8
points per game) and rebounder (9.2). She scored just 2 points in
the first half as the guards got the job done while she sat on the
bench in foul trouble. She got 16 in the second when it was her
turn to go to work.
</P>
<P>
   The Irish have that kind of team, with someone always ready to
step up. In the first half, it was the backcourt of Niele Ivey (13
points) and Danielle Green (8).
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave us a lot of confidence knowing Ruth was on the bench
and the guards were taking over the scoring,'' said Notre Dame
coach Muffet McGraw.
</P>
<P>
   Riley's 18 points ended up leading four Notre Dame players in
double figures, with Ivey (17), Danielle Green (14, plus 11
rebounds), and Sheila McMillen (13) all coming up big. For the
Eagles, Alissa Murphy had 20, while Whitney Steele and Brianne
Stepherson each added 12.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence was the magic word. From the first minutes, it was a
notably different Irish squad from the lackluster bunch that lost
to BC, 78-65, in their first meeting this season, at Conte Forum
Dec. 30. ``Last time we played Boston College, I played poorly, so
I just wanted to go out there and be intense,'' said Ivey. ``I came
into the game knowing I had to play better than last time.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, so did her teammates. After trading leads for the
first 10 minutes, Notre Dame began to pull away when Ivey hit her
third 3-pointer _ she had four by night's end _ to put the Irish
up, 21-16. After a BC 20-second timeout, Steele hit a layup to
bring the Eagles within 3, 21-18. But they got no closer as Notre
Dame edged forward quietly until an exclamatory 3-pointer by
McMillen three seconds before the buzzer put the Irish up by 10,
35-25, at the half.
</P>
<P>
   Amid an abundance of errant passes, juggled receptions, and
airballs, the story was told under the boards, where BC got
outrebounded, 13-4, offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not getting many second shots, that was the big thing for
us,'' said Inglese.
</P>
<P>
   In their earlier meeting, BC outrebounded the Irish, 34-28,
largely on the strength of freshman Becky Gottstein's 16. This time
ND held her to three.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our game plan,'' said McGraw.
</P>
<P>
   As the second half began, BC cut the lead to 6, 37-31, with a
steal and driving layup by Murphy. Three-pointers by Ivey and
McMillen helped get the Irish lead up to 16 with 15:36 remaining
before Stepherson answered with a three. That started a 12-point
Eagle run as Notre Dame went without a basket for almost six
minutes and its lead shrank to 4, 50-46, with nine minutes left.
But the Eagles ran out of steam, and ND got away.

PARENTS, SCHOOL OFFICIALS SOUGHT IN WAKE OF ATTACK ON PRINCIPAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Concerned parents and school administrators have
met with police at Burton Street Elementary School in hopes of
easing tensions there, after the principal was beaten in what
detectives suspect was a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Principal Norman G. Bernstein on Monday at the
school has highlighted problems between him and some parents who
object to his management style and have petitioned to remove him
from the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators and parents alike said they believe the attack
was not tied to tensions on the campus, where Bernstein has been
principal for seven years. He has said he plans to return to the
school once he recovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel so sorry,'' said Lorena Aguilar, whose son is among
750 students at the campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just want things to cool down,'' said Socorro Serrano, a
school district spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein, 65, was beaten into unconsciousness in front of the
school by two men who told him, ``We don't want you here anymore,
principal. Do you understand that, white principal?''
</P>
<P>
   Police said they have no suspects in the crime, which they are
investigating as racially motivated. Bernstein did not see the
attackers clearly enough to provide police with a description.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crime is a serious crime and we're going to investigate it
to its fullest extent. But we need witnesses,'' said Sean Kane,
commanding officer of the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators stepped up security at the campus and asked anyone
with information to call them at (818) 756-8371 or (818) 756-8346
after hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm stunned,'' said Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev
Yaroslavsky, whose district includes Panorama City.
</P>
<P>
   Yaroslavsky said he will ask his colleagues to issue a $25,000
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
those involved in the surprise attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The community needs to come together to make a clear and
united voice against hate crimes,'' he said during a news
conference at the school. ``We will not tolerate any kind of
violence against any of our educators.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, crisis counselors consoled children, some of
whom wrote ``get well'' cards to their principal.
</P>
<P>
   The mugging occurred about 6:30 a.m. Monday as the principal
parked his car in front of the school to report to work at 8111
Calhoun Ave., police said. When he got out of his car, he was
assaulted by two men.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein said in an interview that he tried to fight off the
attackers, but one held a sharp object to his neck, nicking him and
then knocking him unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The violent confrontation left school staffers and parents alike
baffled about how this could happen at their historically safe
campus, which opened eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about my child's security here and what's going to
happen,'' said one parent, Gloria Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   Nine-year-old Edith Orozco said she also wants answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sad. I like him. He helped me in third grade when I
fell down and he picked me up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles school board member Julie Korenstein met with
faculty members and parents to discuss the attack and the morale on
campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very distraught. I feel badly about it,'' said Korenstein,
whose district includes Panorama City. ``My hope is to be able to
sit down and resolve the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Issues that parents have raised about Bernstein include: the
dismantling of bilingual education because of Proposition 227; the
year-round schedule; and how the principal manages his teachers and
staff.
</P>
<P>
   School administrators postponed a meeting scheduled for today
with parents that was called to discuss the transitioning of
students to the English immersion classes.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was postponed to avoid further tensions and to allow
some time for people to calm down, Serrano said.
</P>
<P>
   One teacher, who declined to be identified, voiced support for
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does listen to the parents, and he's doing the best job he
can,'' she said. ``If they're upset with the principal, they should
go through the district meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   John Liechty, the Los Angeles Unified School District's
assistant superintendent of instruction assigned to the San
Fernando Valley, said he is aware of parental concerns with
Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some concerns brought forward by some
parents,'' he said, declining to provide more details.
</P>
<P>
   One parent, Sandra Velasquez, disagreed with the school going to
a year-round calendar, so she pulled her children, ages 7 and 10,
out of Burton Elementary and sent them to a traditional calendar
school in September.
</P>
<P>
   The attack still rattled her.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has always been quiet here,'' she said. ``This is very
weird this is going on.''

MARINES PAST, PRESENT SAY `SEMPER FI'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
( Dennis McCarthy is a columnist at the Los Angeles Daily News.) 
BY DENNIS MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMP PENDLETON &UR; ,  &LR; Calif. _ The young Marine sergeant stood at
attention, anxious for his turn to say thank you to a World War II
legend _ 80-year-old Medal of Honor recipient Mitchell Paige.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Jason Neale had just been named Marine of the Year by his
commanding officer in the 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton _
judged the best and brightest young Marine in his outfit. But right
now, he looked more like a star-struck kid waiting to ask John
Wayne for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes never strayed from the shiny, beautiful medal hanging
from Paige's neck _ the highest honor this country bestows for
bravery.
</P>
<P>
   Neale knew exactly why this man had been awarded that coveted
medal by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. How as a young platoon
sergeant on Guadalcanal in the Pacific theater in October 1942,
Paige's machine-gun platoon repelled wave after wave of enemy
soldiers trying to overtake its hilltop position.
</P>
<P>
   How when reinforcements finally arrived the next day, they found
Paige's whole platoon either dead or severely wounded. Only Paige
was still able to fight _ moving from machine gun to machine gun,
firing from the hip until there were no more enemies left to
charge.
</P>
<P>
   His bravery is legendary in the Marine Corps, and now here he
was in person with hundreds of other retired Marines from past wars
and campaigns, celebrating the 1st Marine Division's 58th
anniversary this week at Camp Pendleton.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Marines getting a chance to pay their respects to
yesterday's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, this is a great honor to meet you,'' Neale said, saluting
Paige. ``I'm a machine gunner too, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige smiled and stuck out his hand to congratulate Neale for
being named Marine of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good luck, son,'' Paige said, as another wave of young Marines
moved in to salute and shake the hand of a real fighting legend.
</P>
<P>
   Off to the side, Lou Weiner of Tarzana, who served with a
howitzer unit of the 105th on Guadalcanal, stood watching the scene
with Maj. Gen. Michael Hagee, the division's commanding general.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at them,'' Hagee said. ``These young Marines have read
about the battles these men fought for this country, but to talk to
them and see them in person, well, it brings the history alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``You men are the reason we're here today,'' the general said,
turning to Weiner and a handful of other old Marines, including Abe
Goldberg, the oldest original member of the 1st Division at 88.
</P>
<P>
   The men smile, their chests puffed out with pride. After all
these years, it was wonderful to hear words like that, wonderful to
feel the respect and admiration of today's Marines who are young
enough to be their grandkids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is sir this, sir that,'' Weiner said, laughing.
``They sir you to pieces. I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   Half an hour later, the men were moving slowly through a chow
line in the mess hall, looking at a selection of food none of them
ever enjoyed as Marines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you one thing, they sure eat a heck of a lot better
than we ever did,'' Weiner said as a young female Marine, Pvt.
Alison Kellam, laughed.
</P>
<P>
   That's another thing yesterday's Marines never had, either _
women in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One woman Marine told me she joined because she hated her
father and mother, and wanted to get away from home,'' said Korean
War vet Kevin Burns, adding with a laugh: ``After being in the
Marines four months, she said she now loved her father and mother,
and her home. She said the Marines taught her the importance of
discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellam, who has been in the Marines since April 1998, agreed.
``My whole life and values have changed,'' she said. ``I've got
more structure to my life, and a lot more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, yesterday's Marines were on a bus to witness
another thing that has changed significantly since their day _
weaponry and firepower.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, would I have loved to have this thing in Korea,'' said
Vince Masascio, holding a grenade launcher. ``All we had were M-1
rifles, carbines, .45s and a lot of hand grenades.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, Ed Sundberg of Oxnard looked over some mortar launchers.
``When we landed at Guadalcanal in that first wave, I had 12
grenades strapped to my chest, a rifle, three bandoleers of
ammunition and a backpack with C rations in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was rainy, wet and miserable. We spent the first few days
burying the dead who washed ashore. The only food we had after the
C rations ran out was from the fish heads and rice we captured from
the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rice was full of maggots. When you're starving, you begin
to look at them as a source of protein, not maggots.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of the young Marines looked at each other and made
faces. Eating maggots to survive? Ugh!
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me more than 47 years to talk about these things, and
see my old Marine buddies again,'' Sundberg said. ``Seven years
ago, I couldn't tell you what I'm saying now.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of young Marines in a foxhole watch as Sundberg and a
couple of other old Marines walk across a dirt road to see a
howitzer firepower display.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, sometimes we get to complaining about things,'' one
of them said. ``Then we think about the old-timers and what they
went through, and we realize we've got nothing to complain about.''

CLIPPERS TO SIGN DOUGLAS
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The last domino finally has fallen and will
deliver crusty veteran point guard Sherman Douglas to the Clippers
in 24 hours or less.
</P>
<P>
   With the NBA's roster deadline dropping today at 3 p.m., PST,
the team is expected to sign the New Jersey free agent to a
contract worth $2-$2.5 million this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of a team sport,'' said first-year coach Chris
Ford, ``is to keep bringing in people who are going to help the
team. If it comes to fruition, we went out and got the best we
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, the Clippers' target in an earlier bid to ``upgrade''
their point-guard stable, was seeking to claim all of the team's
$3.7 million salary-cap bounty during discussions last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the nine-year vet also was open to signing with his hometown
Wizards if they and their big-ticket free agent, Rod Strickland,
ended a rocky relationship. While Douglas waited, the Clippers
re-signed the incumbent, Darrick Martin, to a one-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Elgin Baylor, the Clippers' vice president of
basketball operations, kept Douglas, who averaged 8 points and 4
assists as a backup for the Nets last season as the ace up his
sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   When Strickland re-signed with the Wizards on Wednesday,
Douglas-to-the-Clippers was back on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the deal goes through,'' Ford said, ``hopefully we can have
him at practice tomorrow (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said he has spoken to Martin and Pooh Richardson, his
current backup, about making room for Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they understood,'' Ford said. ``I just wanted to be
honest with them.''

TEXAS HIGH SCHOOL HAS 7 DIVISION I SIGNEES
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Justin Faust never played a down of football
in his senior year at Arlington Lamar High, tearing up his knee
before the opening game. As a junior, he was a part-time player,
sharing the featured running back role with Mohammed Shittu and
running the ball only 60 times all season.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, the 6-foot, 195-pounder sat down at a table in the
Lamar library and signed a letter of intent to play major college
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``What that tells me,'' said Faust, who will join the Stanford
Cardinal in the fall, ``is that there's no question about Lamar's
reputation for turning out talent. Our reputation is unmatched
anywhere. This is Tailback High.''
</P>
<P>
   And Defensive Lineman High and Defensive Back High, and about
any other position, too. The Vikings, who won their fourth
consecutive district championship last season (including a
co-championship with Martin in 1996), now have taken the lead in
the college recruiting race as well.
</P>
<P>
   At a mass signing ceremony yesterday morning, 13 Vikings signed
letters of intent to play college football, seven of them with
Division I schools. That beats the 11 who signed from state Class
5A Division I champion Duncanville, and matched Duncanville's seven
Division I signees. And Lamar will get an eighth player in the I-A
ranks when defensive lineman Nick Losada signs. He already has
received an appointment to the Air Force Academy but is waiting on
possible opportunities at Clemson and Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers give Lamar its biggest class of
scholarship-winners ever, one that ranks not only among the area
leaders, but the national leaders as well. The list includes one of
America's highest-profile recruits, defensive tackle Cedric
Hilliard (Notre Dame), as well as star running back Tommicus
Walker, a TCU signee and the younger brother of Nebraska standout
Joe Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our biggest class, but it isn't news,'' coach Eddy
Peach said. ``We had 36 kids playing college football last year.
This has been a trend for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Hilliard: ``I think coaches from in and out of state know
where to come to find good ballplayers. I mean, we've had something
good going on here for a while, but a group like this will probably
help get Lamar players even more exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Lamar players need it.
</P>
<P>
   This year, several players required little to no sales pitch to
colleges, including Hilliard, Walker and Faust, among others. But
not everyone was in that boat. Linebacker John Paul Mulligan, for
example, put together a highlight tape and sent it to schools
around the country before eventually signing with Texas
A&AMP;M-Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not coach's job to get you a scholarship,'' Mulligan
said. ``He'll tell the colleges about you and speak up for you. But
he's a football coach, not a salesman.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, sometimes those jobs are one and the same. Ray
Biery III, father of wide receiver Ray Biery IV, said Peach was
instrumental in helping his son earn a scholarship to Missouri
Southern.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our situation, we kind of worked together with him,'' Ray
III said. ``We kept in touch and bounced ideas off each other.
Coach Peach is well connected and well respected by college
coaches, and we were in touch with him all the time trying to get
things going for Ray.''
</P>
<P>
   And the result was good news on signing day for Biery and 12 of
his teammates. Of course, there will be more to come, this year and
in future seasons.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the hottest prospect on next year's Vikings will be
Reggie Harrell, a 6-foot-4, 210-pound wide receiver-defensive back
who already has recruiters drooling over his size and speed. After
spending much of last season on the bench behind Lamar's sparkling
seniors, Harrell will get the chance to win his scholarship in the
fall.
</P>
<P>
   And the scouts will be there to see it. Count on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most recruiters you talk to are already familiar with Lamar
and the program here,'' said defensive back Justin Browne, who
signed with North Carolina. ``I'm sure seeing a group like this
coming out this year will make people want to make sure they make a
stop here next year to see what's coming up.''

MAKER OF WHEELS ON ROLL AFTER SETBACK
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wheel manufacturer Superior Industries
International Inc. said Wednesday that it has rebounded from last
summer's labor strife at General Motors Corp. as fourth-quarter
earnings and sales hit record levels.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter, Superior earned $19.55 million, equal to 71
cents a share, an increase of 25 percent from the prior year's
period, on sales of $152.7 million. In the 1997 fourth quarter,
Superior earned $15.65 million, or 56 cents a share, on sales of
$150.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly earnings exceeded analysts' expectations by almost 11
percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Superior, which makes original equipment aluminum wheels for
leading domestic and foreign car and truck companies, has secured a
number of significant supply contracts that helped boost
fourth-quarter results and could drive growth through 1999. They
include wheels for Ford Motor Co.'s Windstar and General Motors
Corp.'s new GMT800 full-size and light-truck program, which is
considered that company's most significant vehicle introduction in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were real pleased with the quarter and those (contracts
brought) major increases for sure,'' said R. Jeffrey Ornstein,
Superior's vice president and chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   The company also makes accessory products for the national
automotive aftermarket. It has plants in Van Nuys, Mexico, Europe,
Kansas and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Superior earned $52.32 million, or $1.88 per
share, compared with income of $55.39 million, or $1.96, in 1997.
Sales in 1998 totaled $539.4 million vs. $549.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The dip reflects the impact of the GM strike on second- and
third-quarter performance. During the strike, Superior idled 200 of
the 1,000 workers at its Van Nuys plant and shut operations at its
plants in Kansas and Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, GM accounted for about 47 percent of Superior's
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Superior's stock, traded on the New York Stock Exchange, closed
Wednesday at $27.375, down $1.125, a slide of 3.95 percent.

TEKELEC IN MARKET'S WOODSHED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS -- The market pounded telecommunications equipment
maker Tekelec on Wednesday, the day after the company missed
analysts' fourth-quarter earnings estimates by more than 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Shares dropped $4.6875, or 23.44 percent, to close at $15.3125.
More than 19 million shares traded hands, or about 31 times the
30-day average trading volume in the company, which makes network
switching equipment and diagnostic tools.
</P>
<P>
   After the markets closed Tuesday, Tekelec reported
fourth-quarter income of 16 cents per share, compared with the 19
cents per share anticipated by a group of analysts surveyed by
First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call after the release of its numbers, Tekelec
officials blamed the shortfall in the quarter on failure of several
anticipated sales contracts to close on time. For the year,
however, the company reported 59 cents per diluted share, nearly
meeting the First Call estimate of 60 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement that Tekelec had won a deal to supply US West
with equipment worth $5 &UR;  &LR; million to $6 &UR;  &LR; million may have tempered
the sell-off. At one point in early trading, the stock was down by
more than $6, or about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tekelec officials were unavailable for comment Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Wednesday that Tekelec deserved a drubbing but
predicted that the shares will likely return to the $20-plus range
if it meets coming estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in the Wall Street doghouse,'' said analyst Tim
Savageaux at Volpe Brown Whelan. ``They missed the quarter, and
people were disappointed with that. But there were several rays of
light.''
</P>
<P>
   Savageaux said he has cut his 12-month target price on Tekelec
shares from $30 to $22 because he expects investors will balk at
paying a price-to-earnings premium for the stock until it meets
estimates for a few quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Having struggled for market share throughout the 1990s,
supplying mostly smaller and newcomer telecom operators, Tekelec
emerged last year as a recognized if still relatively minor
supplier to blue-chip firms. That was highlighted in October when
the company landed a contract to sell Sprint between $4 &UR;  &LR; million to
$5 &UR;  &LR; million worth of switching equipment, then again with the US
West deal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say they expect the company to gain further recognition
and business from big players this year.

IOWA STATE PROGRAM ATTRACTS QB FROM FORT WORTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STACY FEDUCIA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Fort Worth Dunbar High School quarterback
Ronald Veal spent a summer in throwing camps, honing his arm,
working with receivers, dreaming of leading the Wildcats to the
District 9-4A championship, then the playoffs, then college ...
</P>
<P>
   Then he broke his collarbone in a Week 6 game against Trimble
Tech and his season ended.
</P>
<P>
   Veal (6-foot-2, 217 pounds) found himself on the sideline as the
Wildcats lost two of their final four games and finished 7-3 and
out of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went into a state of depression,'' Veal said. ``I was afraid
I wouldn't get a chance to show anybody what I could do. I was sick
to my stomach that I couldn't be out on the field, helping my
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Veal's fears were put to rest yesterday when he signed a
national letter of intent, accepting a scholarship from Iowa State.
His teammate, tight end Erron Matthews, signed with the Cyclones as
well, bringing Dunbar's total to five Division I signees this
season.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 20 football players from Fort Worth schools signed
letters of intent yesterday in ceremonies at six schools.
</P>
<P>
   Veal's signing capped a four-year journey from an expelled
freshman attending alternative school to an accomplished senior
attending a university known for its psychology program, his major
of choice.
</P>
<P>
   His career at Dunbar started with an altercation with a teammate
about Veal's No. 4 jersey _ the same jersey number he will wear at
Iowa State. The fight resulted in Veal's expulsion and he finished
the season at an alternative school.
</P>
<P>
   A dislocated shoulder ended Veal's sophomore season after the
third game. He moved from linebacker to quarterback his junior
year, and through five games that season, Veal had rushed 105 times
for 587 yards with five touchdowns. He had also completed 74 of 163
passes for 1,115 yards with 11 touchdowns and five interceptions _
and earned second-team all-district honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried about him not getting recruited _ it would
have been different if it had been a knee or something like that,''
Dunbar coach Bob Jones said. ``More than anything else, he knew it
hurt our chances at getting to the playoffs. I would've loved to
have lined up against anybody with him at full strength. That's why
Iowa State knows they're getting a steal.''
</P>
<P>
   Recruited as a running back, Veal knew that Iowa State would be
the place for him when he arrived in Ames and it felt like ``a
family reunion.'' The prospective psychology and philosophy
double-major was given the opportunity to meet with a distinguished
member of the Iowa State psychology faculty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a room full of cabinets of studies they had done for
television, editorials, journals,'' Veal said. ``I only had an hour
and a half with him, but it went by so fast. I even brought home
some of the studies to read on the plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he could start the season third on the depth chart, Veal
aspires to get his doctorate in psychology, rather than further his
football career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to set my focus on going to the NFL because I
know how fleeting this can be,'' Veal said. ``My high school career
hasn't been a whole bed of roses. I've had enough setbacks that I
know not to take things for granted.''

   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan _ gravely ill _ is back in America
fighting his fourth, and many fear, final bout with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia _ plump to the point of obesity _ can
scarcely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat _ he of the shaking hand and trembling lip _
suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal
air crash.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad of Syria, who suffered a heart problem as
far back as 1983, has already lost his favorite son, Basil, in a
road accident.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has never _ not once in all his
18 years in power _ appointed a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Even to mention the word ``succession'' in public provokes a
familiar gesture by friends in the Middle East; their eyes move
ever so carefully over their shoulders. It is the unspoken crisis,
the great unmentionable, a subject heavy enough to poison any
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But it is real. And we in the West, of course, accept this odd,
cantankerous, dangerous system of inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Not once have we ever encouraged a democratic state in the
Middle East, one which would allow Arab citizens to choose their
own leaders. Because we like dictatorships. We know how to do
business with the kings and generals _ how to sell them our tanks
and fighter-bombers and missiles _ unless they disobey us, like
Gamal Nasser and Muammar Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre feature of our present relations with the Arab
world that Saddam is the only leader whose overthrow President Bill
Clinton has called for in the name of ``democracy,'' demanding that
the Iraqis should have a government that ``represents its people
and respects them.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely tale. How many other Arab governments, for heaven's
sake _ with their secret police and their torture chambers _
``represent'' their people? And how many of them has President
Clinton sought to depose? Not one.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families.
</P>
<P>
   True, we were happy to see King Farouk booted out of Egypt and
King Idris out of Libya (we liked Qaddafi then) and to depose the
Sultan of Oman in favor of his public-school son. But we want
strong leaders who will be loyal to us. Let them have human rights,
we say. But we do not want democracy in their countries (which
means, of course, that there will be no human rights).
</P>
<P>
   And no choice for their people. At least King Hussein had the
wisdom and humility to discuss death with his people when he first
learned he had cancer. But the king _ whose kingdom falls into the
category of liberal amid the other xenophobic states of the region
_ never bothered to consult his citizens about their future leader.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanians were given no chance to decide whom they wished to
rule them. His Majesty ordained that it would be his son Abdullah,
that power would be kept in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone expect anything else? It takes a brave Jordanian to
call for a real constitutional monarchy. Indeed, the only man who
consistently does just that, Leith Shubeilat, finds himself
frequently inside Amman's state security prison.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some of the titans of the Middle East have planned
their succession.
</P>
<P>
   President Assad _ whose energy still stuns the diplomats who sit
through his six-hour conversations _ has groomed his son Bashar, an
ophthalmologist by profession but an increasingly public
personality with an enthusiasm for computer technology, to follow
in his steps.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Taken at face value, Syria's constitution provides for a
democratic system of succession, but Assad controls military,
political, and legislative power; he can dissolve governments and
assemblies; he is secretary-general of the Baath party, commander
in chief of the armed forces. Presumably, Bashar Assad will one day
do the same.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about Arafat? He has no obvious successor and no real
constitutional framework to create one. He has turned his back on
the democracy of the Palestinian assembly and survives by cronyism,
bribes and 13 different security services _ the latter in
cooperation with the CIA and the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   So the Palestinians cannot choose their successor. But be sure
that the Israelis already have someone in mind to take over
``Palestine'' when Arafat leaves us.
</P>
<P>
   In Saudi Arabia, direct succession suggests a struggle to come
among the defense minister, Prince Sultan, Prince Naif and Crown
Prince Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, aware of Abdullah's growing criticism and dislike of
the American presence in the Gulf _ he is said to have told U.S.
Defense Secretary William Cohen that not only could the United
States not use Saudi air bases to bomb Iraq, but that America might
have to leave those air bases altogether _ might favor Prince
Sultan.
</P>
<P>
   His son, it should be noted, is the influential Saudi ambassador
to the U.S., Prince Bandar, who in 1990 was reported in Washington
to be almost as powerful in President George Bush's office as the
secretary of state, James Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The result of our support for all these potentates is regularly
distorted by their Western supporters in Washington, London and,
less obviously, Paris. If we demand full democracy for these
nations, we are told, the Islamists will try to take over.
</P>
<P>
   Cannot we understand, our diplomats point out, that ``whatever
their failings'' (another of my favorite expressions in the Middle
East), these ``friends of the West'' are fighting Islamic
fundamentalism?
</P>
<P>
   So ``Islamic fundamentalism'' becomes the only real opposition
to the Arab governments. We support those undemocratic countries in
their battle against ``fundamentalist terror'' _ and shore up their
regimes.
</P>
<P>
   Wasn't that why we backed Saddam Hussein so generously during
his eight-year aggression against Iran? Because he was preventing
``fundamentalism?''
</P>
<P>
   So who will we put in Saddam's place? My guess is that the
Americans are still looking for a good old-fashioned Iraqi
brigadier-general, a military man who knows how to keep his tribes
in order.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, it would have to be a powerful man, someone who
did not allow dissent to rock the regime, someone with a powerful
security service and a family that might provide a successor.
Someone, in fact, just like Saddam.  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   King Hussein of Jordan _ gravely ill _ is back in America
fighting his fourth, and many fear, final bout with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia _ plump to the point of obesity _ can
scarcely stand, and stumbles on the simplest sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Yasser Arafat _ he of the shaking hand and trembling lip _
suffers ever more from the brain tumor inflicted after a near-fatal
air crash.
</P>
<P>
   President Hafez Assad of Syria, who suffered a heart problem as
far back as 1983, has already lost his favorite son, Basil, in a
road accident.
</P>
<P>
   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt has never _ not once in all his
18 years in power _ appointed a vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   Even to mention the word ``succession'' in public provokes a
familiar gesture by friends in the Middle East; their eyes move
ever so carefully over their shoulders. It is the unspoken crisis,
the great unmentionable, a subject heavy enough to poison any
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But it is real. And we in the West, of course, accept this odd,
cantankerous, dangerous system of inheritance.
</P>
<P>
   Not once have we ever encouraged a democratic state in the
Middle East, one which would allow Arab citizens to choose their
own leaders. Because we like dictatorships. We know how to do
business with the kings and generals _ how to sell them our tanks
and fighter-bombers and missiles _ unless they disobey us, like
Gamal Nasser and Muammar Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bizarre feature of our present relations with the Arab
world that Saddam is the only leader whose overthrow President Bill
Clinton has called for in the name of ``democracy,'' demanding that
the Iraqis should have a government that ``represents its people
and respects them.''
</P>
<P>
   A likely tale. How many other Arab governments, for heaven's
sake _ with their secret police and their torture chambers _
``represent'' their people? And how many of them has President
Clinton sought to depose? Not one.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the

 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Shanghai's ``hot pot'' restaurants have come up with a
recipe for success that has unsuspecting customers soon coming back
for more.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the city's health authorities of 45 such
eateries found that 11 of them had added a little extra something _
opium poppy flowers _ to the broth.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, reported in the city's main newspaper, the Wenhui
Daily, said that customers eating the spiced-up hot pot would
experience ``numbness,'' feelings of incapacity, and illness.
</P>
<P>
   While this might seem unlikely to tempt back customers, the
newspaper claimed that the added special ingredient could prove
addictive. Shanghai health officials refused to comment on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone out in search of Shanghai's hot pot buzz would have a lot
of eating to do, however, as only 15 of the 82 hot pots tested by
the authorities were found to contain the illicit poppies.
</P>
<P>
   Giving hot pot customers a little more than they ordered is not
new, but the newspaper said the test results showed a higher
proportion of opium poppy contamination than in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Hot pot is a traditional Chinese dish, along the lines of
fondue, where diners cook pieces of meat and vegetables in a
central boiling vat of spiced broth or oil.
</P>
<P>
   In a country which regularly still lambasts Britain and other
``imperialist powers'' for the 19th century ``Opium Wars,'' it is
all rather embarrassing. Growing opium poppies is banned, and every
year teams are sent out to investigate illegal poppy planting.
</P>
<P>
   After 1949, the Chinese government stamped out opium dens and
virtually rid the country of drugs, but in recent years the problem
has returned with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   China now has more than half a million registered drug addicts,
and last year police confiscated 2.5 tons of heroin and 325 kg.
tons of opium. The statistics do not record how many gallons of hot

   BEIJING _ Shanghai's ``hot pot'' restaurants have come up with a
recipe for success that has unsuspecting customers soon coming back
for more.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by the city's health authorities of 45 such
eateries found that 11 of them had added a little extra something _
opium poppy flowers _ to the broth.
</P>
<P>
   The survey, reported in the city's main newspaper, the Wenhui
Daily, said that customers eating the spiced-up hot pot would
experience ``numbness,'' feelings of incapacity, and illness.
</P>
<P>
   While this might seem unlikely to tempt back customers, the
newspaper claimed that the added special ingredient could prove
addictive. Shanghai health officials refused to comment on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone out in search of Shanghai's hot pot buzz would have a lot
of eating to do, however, as only 15 of the 82 hot pots tested by
the authorities were found to contain the illicit poppies.
</P>
<P>
   Giving hot pot customers a little more than they ordered is not
new, but the newspaper said the test results showed a higher
proportion of opium poppy contamination than in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Hot pot is a traditional Chinese dish, along the lines of
fondue, where diners cook pieces of meat and vegetables in a
central boiling vat of spiced broth or oil.
</P>
<P>
   In a country which regularly still lambasts Britain and other
``imperialist powers'' for the 19th century ``Opium Wars,'' it is
all rather embarrassing. Growing opium poppies is banned, and every
year teams are sent out to investigate illegal poppy planting.
</P>
<P>
   After 1949, the Chinese government stamped out opium dens and
virtually rid the country of drugs, but in recent years the problem
has returned with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   China now has more than half a million registered drug addicts,
and last year police confiscated 2.5 tons of heroin and 325 kg.
tons of opium. The statistics do not record how many gallons of hot
pot soup were seized.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide anti-drugs campaign recently toured the country
with the theme ``Yes to Life, No to Drugs.'' Shanghai may soon be
host to a new public information blitz: ``Yes to Hot Pot, No to
Opium.'' &QL;

   CHICAGO _ Venture inside the Merchandising Mart in downtown
Chicago, a 1930's Art Deco monolith so large that it has a postal
code all of its own, and you will get an instant glimpse of the
state of the economy in the city and beyond across the American
Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by strong consumer confidence, it continues to boom.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are areas of weakness. Farming is in crisis in the
region, largely because of collapsing hog prices. And an
unemployment rate that dipped to a meager 3.6 percent in the
Midwest last year means that finding qualified workers has become a
nightmare for many employers.
</P>
<P>
   But the plenitude of jobs coupled with low interest rates,
negligible inflation and high stock prices continues to deliver
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing bearish, for example, about the mood at Russ
Berrie and Company, America's best-known teddy bear wholesaler,
which has a permanent showroom for the retail trade in the Mart.
</P>
<P>
   A new high-end product line of ``Vintage Bears'' launched just
this month was sold out within two weeks. Each bear sells at retail
for $30 or more. Business in the showroom is up 1,000 percent over
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers have walked in a placed orders for $30,000 on the
spot,'' reports Geoffrie Cerese, director of sales, who says a
strong retail performance over Christmas explains the rush. ``Since
the new year, business has been rocketing. What is amazing is that
we would sell so many of these bears so quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   One floor below Russ Berrie is Smartrooms Inc., a supplier of
custom cabinetry for kitchens and bathrooms. Its business is
benefiting from an explosion of new-home sales across the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brutally swamped,'' is the best description Smartrooms vice
president, James Livingston, can offer for the state of his
business right now.
</P>
<P>
   How long can it last? ``You have to reach a saturation point and
I can kind of foresee that,'' he replies, warning that one day
there will be more new homes than people to live in them. ``But I
think we have probably got another three years left. I sure hope
so.''
</P>
<P>
   The scramble by employers to find skilled workers may soon
become critical, however, which in turn could spell pressure on
wages and a new inflation risk.
</P>
<P>
   One Chicago-based bank, TCF National, revealed that it is even
sending scouts into city shopping malls. ``If we're being waited on
by somebody who's very good, like at a shoe store, we try to
recruit them,'' said a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For recruitment firms, like Esquire Staffing Group with offices
in downtown Chicago, it means the pressure to find workers is
relentless.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this in the 40 years I've been
in the business,'' says Esquire Chief Executive Sherwin Fischer.
His consultants simply can't find enough people to fill all the
vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people are nervous wrecks and they don't dare take any
time off because they're making $2000 a day.''
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago he was predicting at least a slowdown during
1999, but now he is not so sure. ``Frankly, I don't see and end to
it.''

 By JEREMY WARNER  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVOS _ Bill Gates, the computer software pioneer, has added his
weight to the chorus of voices warning that Internet stocks have
become seriously overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies, some of them now valued by stock
markets at billions of dollars, would not survive the competitive
pressures of the World Wide Web, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that he was a software specialist and not an expert on
stock valuations, Gates said he would not advise any friend to
invest in Internet companies, and those who did were taking on
``monumental risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire software entrepreneur said that the pace of
change in Internet technology and the degree of commercial
competition that the Net makes possible made projections for the
future revenues of many of these companies highly suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising observation which seemed to question the very
high valuation the stock market puts on his own company, Microsoft,
Gates told a meeting of journalists at the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, that he thought that all technology stocks were
much too highly valued.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be selling on lower multiples than ordinary
companies because this business is changing so rapidly, and as a
consequence it is impossible to predict an earnings stream into the
future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney and Coca-Cola are in a far more stable position in the
marketplace than we are, and with them you know they will be making
good profits for years to come. With many tech companies this is
not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates predicted that the balance of benefit from the rapid
growth of electronic commerce would be with consumers rather than
the businesses that operate on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many old established distribution companies are now appearing
on the Internet and the competition is going to be intense,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are rushing in like a gold rush. In some respects
this is a good thing since it attracts huge amounts of venture
capital into the business and that accelerates the pace of progress
and change in this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said Microsoft wouldn't rule out buying an Internet
company, even at current valuations. ``Sometimes there is a piece
which fits into our strategy which might make it worth paying these
valuations, but that is very different from what the company is
worth on a stand-alone basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates thought it a terrible indictment of European enterprise
and business that the composition of its top 50 companies had
changed so little over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., only three or four of the top 50 companies are the
same. In Europe it's the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Gates thought it unlikely that Microsoft would still be in its
present position in the league table of U.S. companies in 25 years
time, given the degree of competitive pressure and change it has to
respond to.
</P>
<P>
   Looking relaxed and at ease with the world, Gates said he wasn't
allowing the antitrust case against Microsoft in the U.S. to
interfere with either his life or his company.
</P>
<P>
   There are more important things in life, he said, admitting that
he now takes his daughter to school every Wednesday morning before
going to work. &QL;

<P>
   DAVOS _ Bill Gates, the computer software pioneer, has added his
weight to the chorus of voices warning that Internet stocks have
become seriously overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these companies, some of them now valued by stock
markets at billions of dollars, would not survive the competitive
pressures of the World Wide Web, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that he was a software specialist and not an expert on
stock valuations, Gates said he would not advise any friend to
invest in Internet companies, and those who did were taking on
``monumental risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The billionaire software entrepreneur said that the pace of
change in Internet technology and the degree of commercial
competition that the Net makes possible made projections for the
future revenues of many of these companies highly suspect.
</P>
<P>
   In a surprising observation which seemed to question the very
high valuation the stock market puts on his own company, Microsoft,
Gates told a meeting of journalists at the World Economic Forum in
Davos, Switzerland, that he thought that all technology stocks were
much too highly valued.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be selling on lower multiples than ordinary
companies because this business is changing so rapidly, and as a
consequence it is impossible to predict an earnings stream into the
future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney and Coca-Cola are in a far more stable position in the
marketplace than we are, and with them you know they will be making
good profits for years to come. With many tech companies this is
not the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates predicted that the balance of benefit from the rapid
growth of electronic commerce would be with consumers rather than
the businesses that operate on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many old established distribution companies are now appearing
on the Internet and the competition is going to be intense,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are rushing in like a gold rush. In some respects
this is a good thing since it attracts huge amounts of venture
capital into the business and that accelerates the pace of progress
and change in this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates said Microsoft wouldn't rule out buying an Internet
company, even at current valuations. ``Sometimes there is a piece
which fits into our strategy which might make it worth paying these
valuations, but that is very different from what the company is
worth on a stand-alone basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates thought it a terrible indictment of European enterprise
and business that the composition of its top 50 companies had
changed so little over the past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   In the U.S., only three or four of the top 50 companies are the
same. In Europe it's the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Gates thought it unlikely that Microsoft would still be in its
present position in the league table of U.S. companies in 25 years
time, given the degree of competitive pressure and change it has to
respond to.
</P>
<P>
   Looking relaxed and at ease with the world, Gates said he wasn't
allowing the antitrust case against Microsoft in the U.S. to
interfere with either his life or his company.
</P>
<P>
   There are more important things in life, he said, admitting that
he now takes his daughter to school every Wednesday morning before
going to work. &QL;

<P>
   BEIRUT _ From across the Middle East, there has come an
intriguing _ not to say astonishing _ chorus of approval for Crown
Prince Abdullah of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   In the pages of ``Babel'' _ produced by the one editor you would
never contradict, Saddam Hussein's son, Oudai, readers have been
told Abdullah's appointment is ``one of the King's most intelligent
political decisions since the start of the Sixties.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Gulf, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright talked
of King Hussein's ``magnificent job'' in arranging for his
succession.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, a former Israeli defense ministry official, Alon
Pinkas, said Abdullah was an ``excellent student'' in America.
Pinkas should know; he taught Jordan's future king at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
   But when Saddam Hussein, Madeleine Albright and the Israelis all
sing the same tune, something has got to be wrong.
</P>
<P>
   If the Israelis were prepared to send a killer squad to Amman to
assassinate a Palestinian leader after the peace treaty with
Jordan, why should they be any more prepared to respect the
integrity of Abdullah's kingdom?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, one of the first meetings that Israeli prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu held to discuss Abdullah's succession included
Ephraim Halevy, head of the Mossad intelligence service.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli officials were quoted as saying they would be behind the
Crown Prince ``in the short term.''
</P>
<P>
   And if Saddam Hussein was prepared to send his killer squads to
knock off the Iraqi opposition in Amman, why should his son
suddenly wish to improve relations with the Hashemite dynasty that
gave political asylum to President Saddam's son-in-laws?
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that the Iraqis have suddenly remembered King
Hussein's former friendship with Saddam? Or are they anxious to
ensure Abdullah does not allow the United States to use Amman as a
base to overthrow Saddam's regime?
</P>
<P>
   Closer study of Mrs. Albright's tribute shows she hoped the
transition to Abdullah was ``one that does not cause problems.''
What sort of problems, one wonders, was she anticipating?
Resistance to his leadership from Palestinian Jordanians? Or
resistance by Crown Prince Abdullah to pressure from Washington?
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to be a ``friend'' of America _ another to be
obedient to the wishes of an American president. What if Abdullah
shows as much independence of spirit as his father did in 1991,
when he refused to support the West's military campaign against
Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   There is, in fact, a disturbing irony in the fact that while
British aircraft fly the skies of Iraq's ``no-fly'' zones, a
half-British prince is preparing to rule Iraq's closest Arab
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The colonial history of Jordan can only be reemphasized by
Abdullah's succession. It is not just his English accent _ after
all, the British put his grandfather on the throne, propped up his
father with military leaders (until King Hussein grew tired of
them) and can now claim a half-share in the next king's bloodline.
</P>
<P>
   It's as well for the Palestinians of Jordan _ perhaps 65 percent
of the country _ that Abdullah's wife, Rania al-Yassine, is
Palestinian.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arabs, it should be said, have accepted the new crown
prince's appointment, not with enthusiasm but with the kind of
weariness born of knowing that they will never have a say in the
appointment of their leaders (and only occasionally in their
overthrow).
</P>
<P>
   ``America decided it should be Abdullah,'' one of Lebanon's more
cynical politicians said Friday. ``Without Washington's approval,
he would never have been appointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is true that American fighter-bombers are based _
albeit with less publicity than in the Gulf _ on at least one major
Jordanian airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   It is also true that before King Hussein's original journey to
the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota last year, the Americans were trying
to persuade him to allow the principle Iraqi opposition groups to
use Amman as their headquarters for the future overthrow of Saddam
Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, there was much talk in Jordan of a move eastwards
by the Jordanian army into the Iraqi desert, where the Jordanians
(sponsored by the Americans) would set up a ``sanctuary'' to which
Saddam's dissident legions would supposedly flock before setting
out on a crusade to destroy their Iraqi tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah knows all about dissent _ and how to
suppress it. His special forces units were used to quell riots in
several Jordanian towns last year. Is he then the man the Americans
might now choose to open up a corridor into Iraq?
</P>
<P>
   No wonder ``Babel'' lavished praise on Abdullah's appointment.
This is not the time for Saddam Hussein's son to offend the son of
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder Netanyahu _ while claiming to pray for the
``miracle'' of King Hussein's return to health _ described his
country's peace with Jordan as ``one of the cornerstones of
Israel's national security.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew when King Hussein's anger would break _ Netanyahu was
lucky to get his would-be assassins back from Jordan without a
show-trial in Amman _ but cannot guess when Abdullah's patience
might become exhausted. &QL;

This is not the time for Saddam Hussein's son to offend the son of
King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   And no wonder Netanyahu _ while claiming to pray for the
``miracle'' of King Hussein's return to health _ described his
country's peace with Jordan as ``one of the cornerstones of
Israel's national security.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew when King Hussein's anger would break _ Netanyahu was
lucky to get his would-be assassins back from Jordan without a
show-trial in Amman _ but cannot guess when Abdullah's patience
might become exhausted. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Drive into any large American city and you will see
them _ billboards entreating you to watch such and such a
television station for the excellence of its evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Beaming down at you with impossible smiles will be the faces of
that station's newsreaders. Almost always, it will be a man,
chisel-chinned and serious eyebrows, accompanied by a woman, all
glamor and cheekbone.
</P>
<P>
   The faux-family formula has proved irresistible to roughly nine
out of ten local stations across the land. Pair a man (preferably
young and attractive) with a woman (obligatorily young and
attractive), get some chemistry going between them and the viewers
will reward you.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind if the practice violates the normal standards of
equal opportunity and fairness in hiring and firing. Only the
ratings count.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned, however, because the picture may soon begin to
change.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is in shock over a former star of the Connecticut
news market, Janet Peckinpaugh, 48, who has sued her old employers
at the CBS affiliate in the state capital, Hartford, saying they
dumped her from the station's prime-time evening newscast in 1994
because she was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Peckinpaugh won her case in dramatic fashion. Ruling
that she had indeed been the victim of gender discrimination, the
Hartford jury awarded her damages totaling an astonishing $8.3
million _ more than double what she had been seeking.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant was the Washington Post Company, which used to own
the station through a subsidiary. (The station has since been
sold.)
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, Peckinpaugh was, as it were, the perfect package
for WFSB-TV. With blond hair, green eyes and a high-energy manner,
she was groomed into stardom as the co-anchor of the station's
all-important 6 p.m. Action News.
</P>
<P>
   She earned $250,000 a year and enjoyed other celebrity perks.
But eventually, as she passed the dreaded fortieth birthday, she
began to encounter friction.
</P>
<P>
   Her demise finally came in 1994 when WFSB hired a new male
anchor from a competing station and decreed that all three of its
existing female newsreaders audition before the cameras with its
two male anchors, including the newcomer.
</P>
<P>
   Peckinpaugh scored the lowest of the three women and was demoted
from the evening show. She eventually left to another station and
to a salary of just $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   There were other factors in the case. Most notably, Peckinpaugh
had some years before accused the incoming male anchor, Al Terzi,
with whom she had previously worked, of fondling her in a hotel
room. Her demotion, she said, was partly to do with the fallout
from that episode and male retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   She also testified that her managers had assured her of a
long-running prime-time career at the station, regardless of her
advancing age, and that her demotion had therefore been a breach of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   For the jury, however, it was WFSB-TV's apparent fixation with
matching just two women with its two men that led to Peckinpaugh's
demise and warranted the award of such colossal damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everyone understands that it's the industry practice,''
one jury member said after the verdict. ``But you can't
discriminate on the basis of sex and they were blatant about it.'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (100-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The guy-girl format rules on the national breakfast-time shows
as well, the most celebrated pairing being that of Katie Couric (no
longer really young, but perky) and Matt Lauer (puppy-dog looks but
can look serious) on NBC's ratings runaway, the Today Show.
</P>
<P>
   Where it does not apply is on the nightly network news programs,
broadcast nationally, of ABC, NBC and CBS. Presiding over them
alone for more than a decade have been _ all men here _ Peter
Jennings, Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather.
</P>
<P>
   CBS tried pairing Rather with Connie Chung a few years ago but
then dumped Chung when ratings dived. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Thursday's verdict, Peckinpaugh said her battle had been
for all women in an industry where nature treats the sexes
differently. In TV-land, in other words, women get old while men
get distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   True, there are some female newscast stars with the national
networks, who are, shall we say, no longer in their springtime
years _ notably Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer, and Leslie Stahl.
But as the New York Times noted last week, none among them dare
show one grey hair before the cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Although the issues of age and gender were closely linked in the
case, the jury dismissed the age discrimination element of
Peckinpaugh's suit. This, however, did little to dull the verdict's
impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major victory for every woman in television, and
every woman who wants to go into television,'' Peckinpaugh said.
``It's about time that my industry caught up with the rest of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Those billboards are not coming down just yet, however. David
Klatell of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism,
warns that it may take more to persuade the industry to change its
habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could be more sanguine that this would change the
hiring pattern in American TV news. I fear that it may instead
result more in changes in the firing pattern, with lawyers
instructing news directors to be more careful in the way they let
people go,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES _ Pity the National Enquirer. For the last year,
America has been treated to the greatest tabloid story ever told _
a presidential affair with more salacious details than any
supermarket weekly could ever dream of, a political scandal with
seemingly endless reverberations, and a cast of characters, from
Linda Tripp to Henry Hyde to Larry Flynt, that could keep a daytime
soap writer in ideas for years.
</P>
<P>
   And yet America's tabloid newspapers and downmarket television
reality shows have done singularly badly out of the Monica Lewinsky
scandal.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer's readership is down almost 20 percent, as is the
Globe's. The Star, the newspaper that broke the alleged story of
Bill Clinton's black love child, has performed slightly better, but
its sales figures are deep in depression too.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same story with ``Hard Copy'' and ``Inside Edition,''
the television shows that attempt to emulate on the small screen
what the tabloids do on paper. According to figures released by
Nielsen Media Research, they have lost at last 20 percent of their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Is this a reflection of popular disgust with the
impeachment drama, a realization that sleazoid values in American
society have gone too far?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. If Americans haven't been reading about Monica
Lewinsky in the tabloids, it's because they can find all the facts
and more on the front-page of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   And if they miss it there they can watch the network evening
news. Or one of the 24-hour news channels. Or read it on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There has been such saturation coverage of Monica that the
tabloids simply haven't had a look-in. What can even a rich
publication with near-limitless resources do to trump Kenneth
Starr? A tabloid may be sneaky but none has yet invented a way of
dishing out subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Far from signaling a new vogue for high-mindedness, the
declining sales and viewing figures actually bear witness to the
growing tabloidization of America _ a process that has reached its
apotheosis with Monica Lewinsky but began long before her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tabloidification of American life'' _ of the news, of the
culture, yea, of human behavior _ is such a sweeping phenomenon
that it can't be dismissed as merely a jokey footnote to the
history of the 1990s. Rather, it's the very hallmark of our
times,'' David Kamp wrote in a long analysis in this month's
``Vanity Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the decade, stories like the William
Kennedy Smith rape trial (in which the New York Times took the
unprecedented step of naming the alleged victim), the dismembering
of John Wayne Bobbitt and _ above all _ the O.J. Simpson trial have
pushed tabloid values into the mainstream and left little but
extraneous gossip for the real tabloids to chew over.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six tabloid shows on network television at the beginning
of the decade, three have disappeared altogether _ and it's largely
because the more respectable shows have encroached on their turf.
</P>
<P>
   One former reporter for ``Hard Copy,'' Diane Dimond, recounted
how in 1996 she pursued the story of a Massachusetts woman who was
raising triplets on her own only to discover that exclusive
interview rights had already been snapped up by ABC's star
reporter, Diane Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the big media organizations have done their best to
dress up their stories and investigations in a mantle of
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Most have pointedly refused to run with the (usually accurate)
salacious material dug up by Internet columnist Matt Drudge; they
have, however, done everything to raise the same issues in
interviews and news conferences so they can hide behind the
authority of a congressman, say, to print the same story with a
semblance of honor.
</P>
<P>
   The same has been true of ``Hustler'' publisher Larry Flynt's
revelations on Republican congressmen. The papers happily reported
Bob Livingston's adultery after the would-be Speaker of the House
admitted it himself at Flynt's prompting.
</P>
<P>
   When the same trick failed to make the Georgian House member Bob
Barr flinch, the allegations were pushed into opinion columns
discussing the mores of character assassination rather than taking
their place on the news pages, where they might be seen to give
credence to a notorious pornographer.
</P>
<P>
   That small degree of tact has not left much of a window for the
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker John Waters once characterized the editorial
policy of the three supermarket tabloids as ``We hate you because
you're famous,'' ``We hate you because you're on TV,'' and ``We
hate you because you're famous and have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Monica should have fit into all three tabloid
categories _ but the big guns from the Times and the Washington
Post got there first. &QL;

<P>
   It's the same story with ``Hard Copy'' and ``Inside Edition,''
the television shows that attempt to emulate on the small screen
what the tabloids do on paper. According to figures released by
Nielsen Media Research, they have lost at last 20 percent of their
audience.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Is this a reflection of popular disgust with the
impeachment drama, a realization that sleazoid values in American
society have gone too far?
</P>
<P>
   Not at all. If Americans haven't been reading about Monica
Lewinsky in the tabloids, it's because they can find all the facts
and more on the front-page of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   And if they miss it there they can watch the network evening
news. Or one of the 24-hour news channels. Or read it on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There has been such saturation coverage of Monica that the
tabloids simply haven't had a look-in. What can even a rich
publication with near-limitless resources do to trump Kenneth
Starr? A tabloid may be sneaky but none has yet invented a way of
dishing out subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Far from signaling a new vogue for high-mindedness, the
declining sales and viewing figures actually bear witness to the
growing tabloidization of America _ a process that has reached its
apotheosis with Monica Lewinsky but began long before her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tabloidification of American life'' _ of the news, of the
culture, yea, of human behavior _ is such a sweeping phenomenon
that it can't be dismissed as merely a jokey footnote to the
history of the 1990s. Rather, it's the very hallmark of our
times,'' David Kamp wrote in a long analysis in this month's
``Vanity Fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the decade, stories like the William
Kennedy Smith rape trial (in which the New York Times took the
unprecedented step of naming the alleged victim), the dismembering
of John Wayne Bobbitt and _ above all _ the O.J. Simpson trial have
pushed tabloid values into the mainstream and left little but
extraneous gossip for the real tabloids to chew over.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six tabloid shows on network television at the beginning
of the decade, three have disappeared altogether _ and it's largely
because the more respectable shows have encroached on their turf.
</P>
<P>
   One former reporter for ``Hard Copy,'' Diane Dimond, recounted
how in 1996 she pursued the story of a Massachusetts woman who was
raising triplets on her own only to discover that exclusive
interview rights had already been snapped up by ABC's star
reporter, Diane Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the big media organizations have done their best to
dress up their stories and investigations in a mantle of
respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Most have pointedly refused to run with the (usually accurate)
salacious material dug up by Internet columnist Matt Drudge; they
have, however, done everything to raise the same issues in
interviews and news conferences so they can hide behind the
authority of a congressman, say, to print the same story with a
semblance of honor.
</P>
<P>
   The same has been true of ``Hustler'' publisher Larry Flynt's
revelations on Republican congressmen. The papers happily reported
Bob Livingston's adultery after the would-be Speaker of the House
admitted it himself at Flynt's prompting.
</P>
<P>
   When the same trick failed to make the Georgian House member Bob
Barr flinch, the allegations were pushed into opinion columns
discussing the mores of character assassination rather than taking
their place on the news pages, where they might be seen to give
credence to a notorious pornographer.
</P>
<P>
   That small degree of tact has not left much of a window for the
tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker John Waters once characterized the editorial
policy of the three supermarket tabloids as ``We hate you because
you're famous,'' ``We hate you because you're on TV,'' and ``We
hate you because you're famous and have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Monica should have fit into all three tabloid
categories _ but the big guns from the Times and the Washington
Post got there first. &QL;

He will not need a snow-cone head of hair. A record for tattoos
will be unnecessary. His large body won't be pierced all over.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Roberts does not need to accessorize to be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking a big man to step in for the injured Antoine Carr, the
Rockets landed one of the biggest. Rather than join the pursuit of
free-agent free spirit Dennis Rodman, the Rockets instead came to
terms with Roberts on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is listed at 7-0 and 290 pounds, but estimates have him
weighing closer to 320. Although he has had injury problems during
his seven-year career, he played in 74 games last season, averaging
6.2 points and 4.2 rebounds for the Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is expected to join the Rockets in Los Angeles today or
Friday but is not expected to play against the Lakers in the season
opener Friday or against the Golden State Warriors on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets hailed his addition as a short-term solution to
the void left by Carr's injury and a long-term answer for their
almost annual search for a quality, wide-bodied backup for Hakeem
Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need another big man,'' Rockets coach Rudy Tomjanovich
said. ``Stanley Roberts is a very talented player. If he can do
what we think he can do, what we have seen him do, he'll be an
asset to this team.''
</P>
<P>
   That is not all that is expected, however. Olajuwon, who has
long preferred to have a weightier backup to wear down opposing
centers, was delighted with the news. But he also planned to put
Roberts to work on the training routine Olajuwon has used to
recapture the leg strength he seemed to have lost last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great addition,'' Olajuwon said. ``I think a player
like Stanley Roberts has tremendous potential. For him to come to
our team with the right players around him that work together will
increase his work ethic. I think he'll have a big role to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want him to complement. Once he comes to the team,
we'll work with him on a strict diet, exercise, stretching, where
he has a new life that can bring out his potential. He has
tremendous potential. When he does this, he will realize this
potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the Rockets players said they would not have
objected had the team chosen to bring in Rodman, Olajuwon was not
sure Rodman could have fit in as easily as he believes Roberts
will.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team chemistry, everything so far, has worked,'' Olajuwon
said. ``The team and the organization would be very skeptical to
bring that risk of distracting chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it (the pursuit of Rodman) was serious. Stanley
Roberts is the right move.''
</P>
<P>
   Forward Charles Barkley said he was not concerned with how well
Roberts fits in or Rodman might have, as long as Roberts is ready
to play and can handle more game time when the compressed schedule
tests the Rockets' depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't worry about chemistry,'' Barkley said. ``I worry about
guys playing well. Dennis is a very good player. We need guys to
play minutes. With the schedule, playing games back-to-back, we
need guys who we can plug in. Obviously, our center is Hakeem. We
need him (Roberts) just to play a couple minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care who we bring in as long as they're ready to play.
Dennis is a good player. Stanley's a good player. That's something
for you guys (the media) to sit around and argue about.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts, who turns 29 on Sunday, could be considered a different
sort of gamble, given his conditioning problems throughout his
career. But Olajuwon was not the only Rockets player who said he
believed that weighty issue would successfully be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee if he comes here, he's going to be dedicated, and
he's going to give his all,'' forward Eddie Johnson said. ``If he
doesn't, he's going to hear from me, and he's going to hear from
other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was among the most supportive of the idea of bringing in
Rodman, praising him Wednesday as a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm at the point I just want to win championships,'' Johnson
said. ``All I know, when that guy gets on the floor, no one
outplays him.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite feeling that way about the player the Rockets did
not seriously pursue, Johnson said Roberts would provide the sort
of big man the team lacked last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to have a big body,'' Johnson said. ``Stanley
has shown an ability to be a force in the middle. We just need big
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the ability to have a guy like that, and when Antoine
comes back from his surgery, and our good young guys in Othella
(Harrington) and Pig Miller, we've got some big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts has long been recognized as more than large. With a good
shooting touch and a combination of post moves, he averaged 10.4
points as a Magic rookie and 11.3 in his second season with the
Clippers. That season, the Clippers pushed the Rockets to a fifth
game in a playoff series, with Roberts averaging 11.4 points and
8.2 rebounds against Olajuwon.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts was so well thought of then that he was among the names
mentioned in trade rumors involving Olajuwon, a coincidence that
six years later Olajuwon found amusing, if irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were talking about trading me for a lot of people,''
Olajuwon said. ``Right now, we're thinking about playing together.
I'm looking forward to having him on the team. He's welcome. I
think he can really help us.''

 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Billy Wagner often recalls the day the football coach at Ferrum
(Va.) College told him to forget about that sport and concentrate
on baseball.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Wagner was gifted at both sports, it was the best
career advice he ever received.
</P>
<P>
   That advice paid off Wednesday to the tune of $10.3 million,
which is how much the Astros will pay Wagner over the next three
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old closer blessed with a lightning bolt for a left
arm will make $2.1 million in 1999, $3.2 million in 2000 and $5
million in 2001. The deal could be worth more in the second and
third years if Wagner reaches certain incentives.
</P>
<P>
   By reaching an agreement, Wagner and the Astros avoided an
arbitration hearing, which was set for Feb. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Although the contract represents a significant salary boost for
Wagner, who made $280,000 last season, he seemed more pleased to
have the security of a long-term contract. Wagner saw his career _
not to mention his life _ flash before his eyes last July when he
was struck in the head by a batted ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``This sure makes it a lot easier to go out there and take those
line drives,'' Wagner joked. ``One minute you're looking at death,
and the next minute you're looking at a three-year deal. This is
just an unbelievable day for me and my family. It's a great
occasion, and I'm glad I'm going to be here for another three
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite having just two full seasons in the majors, Wagner has
made his mark in Houston and around the league. He has 62 career
saves, including 30 last season _ the third-highest single-season
total in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Wagner set a major-league record by averaging 14.4
strikeouts per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy's one of the premier relievers, and he does it in a
dramatic way,'' Astros owner Drayton McLane Jr. said. ``That's what
people liked about Nolan Ryan and some of the other strong
pitchers. People get excited in the ninth inning when Billy comes
in to close a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner converted 30 of 35 save opportunities in 1998, including
a stretch of 19 in arow.
</P>
<P>
   He realizes expectations might be greater now that his salary
has gone up, but Wagner said he intends to approach his job the
same way he always has.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money is not going to change me,'' Wagner said. ``Me and
my wife (Sarah) are simple people. I'm sure that with a higher
price tag, the criticism is going to come along with it. But that
was no different than when I was getting paid $280,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I blow a save (now), what are they going to say? `You stink
worse.' I'm not worried about that. I'm just going to do my job the
best way I know how.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker had been discussing a
multiyear deal with Wagner's agent since the end of the 1998
season. A one-year agreement seemed unlikely after the two sides
exchanged numbers through the arbitration process. The Astros filed
at $2 million compared to Wagner's $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This deal benefits both sides because the arbitration process
_ as much as anything else in our game _ can create a negative
relationship,'' Hunsicker said. ``Any time you can avoid a hearing,
that's in the best interest of everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy Wagner has emerged as one of the best closers in all of
baseball, and you can't win a championship without a reliable
closer. More important than that, this team is built around
character, and Billy certainly exemplifies that on and off the
field.''
</P>

   Hunsicker, who is one of the best talent evaluators in baseball,
seldom falls far from the mark in his assessments of players.
</P>
<P>
   But he was one of 11 baseball executives who missed the boat on
Wagner in the 1993 draft. Hunsicker, who was working for the New
York Mets at the time, used his No. 1 pick on righthander Kirk
Presley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make one of the brightest decisions of my career when
I bypassed a young pitcher out of Ferrum College and chose another
(pitcher) who never got out of (Class) A ball,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Ricky Gutierrez is the only remaining
arbitration-eligible player on the Astros' docket. The two sides
are concentrating on a one-year deal, and they were $725,000 apart
at the time arbitration figures were exchanged.
</P>
<P>
   So far, both sides seem to be sticking to their guns. Hunsicker
said, ``I'm hopeful that we can avoid a hearing with Ricky and make
it a clean sweep.''

<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Glubb had disagreed with Hussein over military strategy _ the
young king wanted to retaliate against the Israelis for raids on
his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officers whom he claimed were ``subversives'' and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, it is fair to ask why we were surprised
by the suddenness of the political upheaval in Amman. The
Hashemites have always lived on the edge, provoking disaster and
recovery with a drama and nerve that astonishes other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to move rapidly between rage and
contemplation, political folly and eternal friendship that might be
a characteristic of the Gulf Arabs rather than the Levant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein's family does, indeed, come from the Gulf, from the
province of Hejaz, and it was his great-grandfather (also Hussein)
whom the Ottomans named as emir, sheriff of the holy Muslim city of
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad 10 years later, King Feisel the Second (grandson of
old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the story of the Hashemites has become the story of
the Plucky Little King, who now lies dying in the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   His English schooling naturally endeared him to the British who
admire courage in adversity. When he married Antoinette Avril
Gardiner, daughter of a Royal Engineers lieutenant colonel, in
1961, it felt as though Jordan had become a British protectorate
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni,'' who became Princess Muna, gave birth to two sons,
Abdullah _ now the crown prince _ and Feisel. She was the second of
four wives for a king whose marriages could be as dramatic and
turbulent as his nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He had divorced his first, older wife Dina within 18 months (the
Jordanian ambassador to Egypt delivered the king's goodbye letter
to the queen when she was visiting a sick relative in Cairo).
</P>
<P>
   The marriage to Toni foundered when his roving eye settled upon
the beautiful Alia Toucan, an employee of Royal Jordanian Airlines,
whose love for the king may have given him lasting peace of mind _
they married in 1972 _ had she not been killed in a helicopter
crash five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he married Lisa Halaby, who became Queen Noor, an
equally beautiful but forceful woman who physically towered over
the king and who developed a strong, and well-founded, distrust of
his introverted, over-intellectualizing brother Hassan (if he had
become king, it was said in Amman, she would have left Jordan).  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having lost the West Bank, the king had to face the
consequences: Palestinian contempt, and what amounted to an
attempted coup d'etat by Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   With a ruthlessness that has still not been fully acknowledged,
Hussein's Bedouin troops slaughtered their way through the
Palestinian camps of Jordan and crushed guerrilla power.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned from his rash decision to go to war in 1967, he
sat out the 1973 Middle East conflict in near-silence, maintaining
semi-secret contacts with Israeli leaders, just as his grandfather
had done.
</P>
<P>
   What he had, he would hold. The Plucky Little King would be a
friend of the West. When a Washington newspaper claimed that the
king had received millions from the CIA, the stories were
suppressed in Amman.  &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   If the middle brother Prince Mohamed seemed a little unstable in
his early years _ there was talk of mental illness _ he has settled
into the role of loyal servant, a bookish chess-player who has
often represented the king.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan, the youngest brother, married a Pakistani wife, and
devoted himself to Jordan's development before ambition took
control of his loyalty. A friend of the king once dangerously
compared him to Cecil Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Until he heard the news of his brother's attempt to control the
army, Hussein never doubted that Hassan would succeed him.  &LR;  &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Long regarded as a pliable ``friend'' of the west, King Hussein
astonished his American allies by embracing Saddam Hussein _ quite
literally _ after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did he really believe
Saddam would ``liberate'' Jerusalem? Or that Jordan could survive
without the Gulf Arabs?
</P>
<P>
   He grew a beard; in Amman, he was called ``Sheriff of Mecca.''
The Saudis were enraged. He appeared to be looking towards lost
lands. He knew the Palestinians would support Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most popular monarch in the Arab world at the very
moment he became the most unpopular monarch in the west.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Americans were ready to roll up the Hashemite
carpet. U.S. newspapers were predicting the end of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But then _ stunned by Yasser Arafat's secret ``peace'' deal with
Israel and himself now politically and economically weakened (an
essential ingredient for any nation wishing to make peace with the
Israelis), the king made his own peace with Yitzhak Shamir and
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   And overnight, the treacherous ally of the beastly Saddam became
again the Plucky Little King.  &LR;  &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   His appointment of Crown Prince Abdullah as regent may safeguard
the Hashemite inheritance. But the pressures will grow greater in
the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would like Abdullah to host the anti-Saddam Iraqi
opposition in Amman, and encourage him to make a military foray
into western Iraq to create a ``safe haven'' for Saddam's Iraqi
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jordanians, as usual, have been given no role in the
succession. The Hashemites may claim their ancestry back to the
Prophet Muhamed _ as they do _ but they are Tudors rather than
democrats, an oligarchy rather than a modern monarchy, however
liberal and decent they are as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is a tank commander, a proven general of Hussein's
Praetorian Guard. In Amman, they tell you not to be fooled by the
soft smile, that Abdullah is a tough guy. He needs to be if he is
going to inherit his father's formidable mantle. &QL;

<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Glubb had disagreed with Hussein over military strategy _ the
young king wanted to retaliate against the Israelis for raids on
his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officers whom he claimed were ``subversives'' and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, it is fair to ask why we were surprised
by the suddenness of the political upheaval in Amman. The
Hashemites have always lived on the edge, provoking disaster and
recovery with a drama and nerve that astonishes other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to move rapidly between rage and
contemplation, political folly and eternal friendship that might be
a characteristic of the Gulf Arabs rather than the Levant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein's family does, indeed, come from the Gulf, from the
province of Hejaz, and it was his great-grandfather (also Hussein)
whom the Ottomans named as emir, sheriff of the holy Muslim city of
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad 10 years later, King Feisel the Second (grandson of
old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine.  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the story of the Hashemites has become the story of
the Plucky Little King, who now lies dying in the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   His English schooling naturally endeared him to the British who
admire courage in adversity. When he married Antoinette Avril
Gardiner, daughter of a Royal Engineers lieutenant colonel, in
1961, it felt as though Jordan had become a British protectorate
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni,'' who became Princess Muna, gave birth to two sons,
Abdullah _ now the crown prince _ and Feisel. She was the second of
four wives for a king whose marriages could be as dramatic and
turbulent as his nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He had divorced his first, older wife Dina within 18 months (the
Jordanian ambassador to Egypt delivered the king's goodbye letter
to the queen when she was visiting a sick relative in Cairo).
</P>
<P>
   The marriage to Toni foundered when his roving eye settled upon
the beautiful Alia Toucan, an employee of Royal Jordanian Airlines,
whose love for the king may have given him lasting peace of mind _
they married in 1972 _ had she not been killed in a helicopter
crash five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he married Lisa Halaby, who became Queen Noor, an
equally beautiful but forceful woman who physically towered over
the king and who developed a strong, and well-founded, distrust of
his introverted, over-intellectualizing brother Hassan (if he had
become king, it was said in Amman, she would have left Jordan).  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Having lost the West Bank, the king had to face the
consequences: Palestinian contempt, and what amounted to an
attempted coup d'etat by Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   With a ruthlessness that has still not been fully acknowledged,
Hussein's Bedouin troops slaughtered their way through the
Palestinian camps of Jordan and crushed guerrilla power.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned from his rash decision to go to war in 1967, he
sat out the 1973 Middle East conflict in near-silence, maintaining
semi-secret contacts with Israeli leaders, just as his grandfather
had done.
</P>
<P>
   What he had, he would hold. The Plucky Little King would be a
friend of the West. When a Washington newspaper claimed that the
king had received millions from the CIA, the stories were
suppressed in Amman.  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   If the middle brother Prince Mohamed seemed a little unstable in
his early years _ there was talk of mental illness _ he has settled
into the role of loyal servant, a bookish chess-player who has
often represented the king.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan, the youngest brother, married a Pakistani wife, and
devoted himself to Jordan's development before ambition took
control of his loyalty. A friend of the king once dangerously
compared him to Cecil Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Until he heard the news of his brother's attempt to control the
army, Hussein never doubted that Hassan would succeed him.  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Long regarded as a pliable ``friend'' of the west, King Hussein
astonished his American allies by embracing Saddam Hussein _ quite
literally _ after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did he really believe
Saddam would ``liberate'' Jerusalem? Or that Jordan could survive
without the Gulf Arabs?
</P>
<P>
   He grew a beard; in Amman, he was called ``Sheriff of Mecca.''
The Saudis were enraged. He appeared to be looking towards lost
lands. He knew the Palestinians would support Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most popular monarch in the Arab world at the very
moment he became the most unpopular monarch in the west.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Americans were ready to roll up the Hashemite
carpet. U.S. newspapers were predicting the end of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But then _ stunned by Yasser Arafat's secret ``peace'' deal with
Israel and himself now politically and economically weakened (an
essential ingredient for any nation wishing to make peace with the
Israelis), the king made his own peace with Yitzhak Shamir and
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   And overnight, the treacherous ally of the beastly Saddam became
again the Plucky Little King.  &LR;  &QL;

 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   His appointment of Crown Prince Abdullah as regent may safeguard
the Hashemite inheritance. But the pressures will grow greater in
the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would like Abdullah to host the anti-Saddam Iraqi
opposition in Amman, and encourage him to make a military foray
into western Iraq to create a ``safe haven'' for Saddam's Iraqi
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jordanians, as usual, have been given no role in the
succession. The Hashemites may claim their ancestry back to the
Prophet Muhamed _ as they do _ but they are Tudors rather than
democrats, an oligarchy rather than a modern monarchy, however
liberal and decent they are as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is a tank commander, a proven general of Hussein's
Praetorian Guard. In Amman, they tell you not to be fooled by the
soft smile, that Abdullah is a tough guy. He needs to be if he is
going to inherit his father's formidable mantle. &QL;

   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad 10 years later, King Feisel the Second (grandson of
old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine.  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Inevitably, the story of the Hashemites has become the story of
the Plucky Little King, who now lies dying in the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   His English schooling naturally endeared him to the British who
admire courage in adversity. When he married Antoinette Avril
Gardiner, daughter of a Royal Engineers lieutenant colonel, in
1961, it felt as though Jordan had become a British protectorate
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni,'' who became Princess Muna, gave birth to two sons,
Abdullah _ now the crown prince _ and Feisel. She was the second of
four wives for a king whose marriages could be as dramatic and
turbulent as his nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He had divorced his first, older wife Dina within 18 months (the
Jordanian ambassador to Egypt delivered the king's goodbye letter
to the queen when she was visiting a sick relative in Cairo).
</P>
<P>
   The marriage to Toni foundered when his roving eye settled upon
the beautiful Alia Toucan, an employee of Royal Jordanian Airlines,
whose love for the king may have given him lasting peace of mind _
they married in 1972 _ had she not been killed in a helicopter
crash five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he married Lisa Halaby, who became Queen Noor, an
equally beautiful but forceful woman who physically towered over
the king and who developed a strong, and well-founded, distrust of
his introverted, over-intellectualizing brother Hassan (if he had
become king, it was said in Amman, she would have left Jordan).  &LR;  &QL;

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Having lost the West Bank, the king had to face the
consequences: Palestinian contempt, and what amounted to an
attempted coup d'etat by Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   With a ruthlessness that has still not been fully acknowledged,
Hussein's Bedouin troops slaughtered their way through the
Palestinian camps of Jordan and crushed guerrilla power.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned from his rash decision to go to war in 1967, he
sat out the 1973 Middle East conflict in near-silence, maintaining
semi-secret contacts with Israeli leaders, just as his grandfather
had done.
</P>
<P>
   What he had, he would hold. The Plucky Little King would be a
friend of the West. When a Washington newspaper claimed that the
king had received millions from the CIA, the stories were
suppressed in Amman.  &LR;  &QL;

   If the middle brother Prince Mohamed seemed a little unstable in
his early years _ there was talk of mental illness _ he has settled
into the role of loyal servant, a bookish chess-player who has
often represented the king.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan, the youngest brother, married a Pakistani wife, and
devoted himself to Jordan's development before ambition took
control of his loyalty. A friend of the king once dangerously
compared him to Cecil Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Until he heard the news of his brother's attempt to control the
army, Hussein never doubted that Hassan would succeed him.  &LR;  &QL;

   Long regarded as a pliable ``friend'' of the west, King Hussein
astonished his American allies by embracing Saddam Hussein _ quite
literally _ after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did he really believe
Saddam would ``liberate'' Jerusalem? Or that Jordan could survive
without the Gulf Arabs?
</P>
<P>
   He grew a beard; in Amman, he was called ``Sheriff of Mecca.''
The Saudis were enraged. He appeared to be looking towards lost
lands. He knew the Palestinians would support Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most popular monarch in the Arab world at the very
moment he became the most unpopular monarch in the west.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Americans were ready to roll up the Hashemite
carpet. U.S. newspapers were predicting the end of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But then _ stunned by Yasser Arafat's secret ``peace'' deal with
Israel and himself now politically and economically weakened (an
essential ingredient for any nation wishing to make peace with the
Israelis), the king made his own peace with Yitzhak Shamir and
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   And overnight, the treacherous ally of the beastly Saddam became
again the Plucky Little King.  &LR;  &QL;

   His appointment of Crown Prince Abdullah as regent may safeguard
the Hashemite inheritance. But the pressures will grow greater in
the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would like Abdullah to host the anti-Saddam Iraqi
opposition in Amman, and encourage him to make a military foray
into western Iraq to create a ``safe haven'' for Saddam's Iraqi
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jordanians, as usual, have been given no role in the
succession. The Hashemites may claim their ancestry back to the
Prophet Muhamed _ as they do _ but they are Tudors rather than
democrats, an oligarchy rather than a modern monarchy, however
liberal and decent they are as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is a tank commander, a proven general of Hussein's
Praetorian Guard. In Amman, they tell you not to be fooled by the
soft smile, that Abdullah is a tough guy. He needs to be if he is
going to inherit his father's formidable mantle. &QL;

   An American court has fined anti-abortion activists $107 million
for an Internet campaign that publishes a ``hit list'' of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The site was certainly highly offensive. Many websites are. This
one, though, was a thinly veiled incitement to hatred, violence and
murder.
</P>
<P>
   The website's graphics featured dripping blood, and
``wanted''-style posters of doctors on the so-called ``Nuremberg
Files.''
</P>
<P>
   The list of target doctors had their addresses attached. The
names of doctors who had been killed in anti-abortion violence had
a line struck through their names; those injured were listed in
grey.
</P>
<P>
   Truly abhorrent.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly we are entering a new and disturbing phase in the
development of the Internet. The technology has, indeed, moved at
an incredible, exponential rate, faster than the ability of public
policymakers to cope with its implications.
</P>
<P>
   It is only 30 years since the first communications between
computers started. Only in 1991 was ``hypertext'' invented, the
device whereby users can jump from one site to another at the click
of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   The advent of the cheap, mass-market personal computer, the
falling cost of phone calls and the introduction of free Internet
subscriptions mean that the Net is already the definitive new mass
medium for the early part of the next century.
</P>
<P>
   We can also predict that it will continue to be used
productively for the creation, publication and exchange of ideas
and information.
</P>
<P>
   It will be used increasingly for commerce, as payment systems
become more secure. And it will be used in ways that we cannot yet
imagine.
</P>
<P>
   In the main it is a great liberating force, inherently anarchic
and, in the best sense of the word, subversive. This, to anyone who
believes in free speech and is excited about the liberating
potential of a medium available to virtually all, is its most
powerful characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   But, as we have seen with the anti-abortion group, there remain
legitimate concerns. The Internet, more than other media, is open
to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   There are sites dedicated to the most vile pornography.
Race-hate networks flourish. ``Recipes'' for incendiary devices and
the like, posted by warped ``bedroom bombers,'' can easily be
located.
</P>
<P>
   And the Internet is a more powerful method of dissemination than
the printed word or the broadcast message because, especially in
the case of children, there are not even the vestigial physical
controls which parents and others can exercise.
</P>
<P>
   All the more important to consider how policymakers should deal
with its destructive potential.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest that a way might be found to control some of the
worst excesses of the Internet is not to make an argument for
censorship. It is, however, to make the case for examining what can
be done to limit the real physical and psychological violence that
this new technology can generate.
</P>
<P>
   State agencies cannot police it in the way that they do books,
newspapers or broadcasting. As the German authorities have found,
even if one nation were to introduce restrictions, service
providers and webmasters could ``migrate'' to more lax regimes.
</P>
<P>
   There are some hopeful signs. Existing legislation can be used,
and should in future be designed, to deal with electronic material.
The very size of the fine levied on the American anti-abortion site
will act as a deterrent to those with similar ambitions in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   More and more Internet service providers are exercising control
over the availability of pornography on their sites. There is some
evidence that more and more self-control on the part of users may _
just _ result in an informal self-regulating regime.
</P>
<P>
   Authoritarians and libertarians alike must agree that the whole
issue of freedom on the Net needs to be examined immediately. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Summers, the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, is
the man at the heart of the debate about how to tackle the troubled
state of the world economy and financial system.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other individual, the Harvard economist turned
influential policymaker is in a position to steer the world towards
calmer waters.
</P>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview with The Independent Wednesday,
Summers emphasized the scale of the challenge facing the U.S. and
other governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been considerable repair in recent months, but there
are still very important challenges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not characterize himself as an optimist.
``World growth is likely to be considerably lower than it has been
in recent years. There is a lot for policymakers to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the preoccupations of the U.S. Administration that
emerged at the recent gathering of the World Economic Forum in
Davos was the reliance of the rest of the world on the American
economy, the only significant engine of growth at present.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges is ensuring that the world economy flies
on multiple engines, not just the U.S.,'' said Summers.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed the view expressed by Al Gore, the U.S. Vice
President, that American consumers and companies could not act as
importers of last resort for the rest of the world. The strength of
U.S. growth set against the rest of the world's is helping to send
the country's balance of payments into record deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought other G7 countries were doing too
little to stimulate their own growth rates, Summers added: ``The
important priority in both Japan and Europe has to be domestic,
demand-led growth. The use of macroeconomic policies to achieve
that is important, and they must carry through on that agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   He was careful not to predict that the successive waves of
financial and economic crisis were now over, and in particular
remained cautious about prospects for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the IMF-led rescue for Brazil now depends on the
government's ability to implement budget reforms _ tax increases
and spending cuts _ in the face of political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil's policy choices, the choices made by the government
and people of Brazil, will be profoundly important, and certainly
also to the U.S.,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson of the turmoil in emerging markets that started in
Mexico at the end of 1994, and reemerged in east Asia in mid-1997
was, he concluded, that good economic policies, in the sense of
sound money, low budget deficits and structural reforms, do work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When countries are able to implement good policies, then, like
Korea and Thailand, they have started to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of successive crises had also set clear
priorities for reforms to the international ``financial
architecture.'' At the top of the list was improved transparency.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the American capital markets, the most important single
innovation was the idea of generally accepted accounting
principles,'' he said. The spread of these principles ``has the
potential to bring about far-reaching cultural change.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, better banking supervision and regulation would be
needed. Summers said the Basle capital standards, set by the Bank
for International Settlements, would be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Thirdly, the international authorities needed better systems of
crisis response.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether such detailed changes would satisfy the critics _
like George Soros _ who argue that the world financial system has
fundamentally broken down and needs sweeping reform, he replied:
``These are serious and technical matters, but they are very
profound.''
</P>
<P>
   However, speaking hours before the U.S. Federal Reserve decided
to announce its decision to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged
this month, Summers was considerably less gloomy about the outlook
for the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic momentum of the U.S. expansion should be
maintained,'' he said, ``albeit with some ups and downs. The
economy is growing rapidly, inflation is low, the banking system is
well capitalized and there is great flexibility. It gives the
economy the ability to respond well to any shocks.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two important priorities for the U.S., in his
diagnosis. One was working to combat inequality, the achilles heel
of the remarkable success of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The other was raising the saving rate, which has fallen to zero
for the household sector. The private sector as a whole has a
record financial deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Summers admitted, somewhat reluctantly, that he saw some merit
in the ``new economy'' argument that new technology had improved
the country's underlying performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``New developments in information technology are very important,
and there's no question we seem to be in a period when normal rates
of unemployment have fallen and normal rates of growth have
risen.'' But he went on: ``These are real changes but it would be a
mistake to assume they will be permanent changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I am increasingly convinced information technology will
change the way the economy works.'' &QL;

PITCHER DELIVERS LIVELY PERSONALITY AND ARM TO TEXAS-ARLINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Texas-Arlington softball player Cassie Brand
walks the line between excited and bizarre each time she steps
inside the pitching circle.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said she's not silly-hyper-goofy. There is no jumping
around and acting foolish simply to draw attention.
</P>
<P>
   It's more like focused-talkative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to communicate,'' Brand said. ``It's important that, no
matter what the situation is, everybody is pumped up. It keeps
everybody in the game. I want other teams to know we're not going
to let down.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand mixes her lively personality with a exceptional right arm,
said UTA third-year coach Debbie Nichols-Hedrick.
</P>
<P>
   After one trip to South Mountain Community College in Phoenix to
watch Brand pitch, Nichols-Hedrick said Brand could be vital to the
1999 Mavericks. When UTA opens the season at noon Sunday against
Texas at Allan Saxe Field, Brand will take her pitching talent _
and other habits _ to the Division I level.
</P>
<P>
   Nichols-Hedrick has no doubt it will be a smooth, chatter-filled
transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a lot of hop on the mound, a lot of personality,''
Nichols-Hedrick said. ``She has charisma, and that kind of
excitement is something we need to bring into this program. She
also has great movement on her pitches, and she throws very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Brand, a 5-foot-9 native of Chandler, Ariz., never expected to
be a highly recruited player out of junior college. That's because
she was sought with little intensity out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   But daily work with junior-college coach J.J. Johnson and
pitching coach Dallas Kullman at South Mountain expanded her
talents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, Brand said she has developed a fastball,
screwball, changeup, rise, off-speed rise and drop pitch. She was
selected first-team, All-Southwest Region her freshman year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I owe a lot to Coach Kullman,'' Brand said. ``I think he saw a
lot of potential in me that I didn't see as a senior in high
school. He taught me to move the ball around. I would struggle
every single day, go home and cry and come back the next day and
work on it all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sophomore year showed even more improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Brand was selected to the All-America team of the National
Junior College Athletic Association. She was one of 14 players from
the United States invited to compete in the National Junior College
Canada Cup last summer. Before she got to South Mountain, the
school had won three of its previous 60 games.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, South Mountain went 31-16.
</P>
<P>
   Brand said she signed with UTA because she has relatives in
Arlington. She also wanted to play for Nichols-Hedrick, the former
All-America pitcher from Louisiana Tech.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the right decision, and I feel good about our team,''
Brand said. ``Whether I'm pitching or not, I'm just excited to be
getting this season started.''
</P>
<P>
   With Brand on the mound, the team is able to move 1998 pitcher
Andrea Becker to third base along with Angela Perry,
Nichols-Hedrick said. An injury to Laura Lewis means Elizabeth
Harsma will move from second base to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Wardlow will take over at second. Nichols-Hedrick said
the other starting positions will be determined later.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my goals is to have a team that hustles from start to
finish,'' Nichols-Hedrick said. ``That's what I have liked in
practice so far.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence Summers, the Deputy Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, is
the man at the heart of the debate about how to tackle the troubled
state of the world economy and financial system.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other individual, the Harvard economist turned
influential policymaker is in a position to steer the world towards
calmer waters.
</P>
<P>
   In an exclusive interview with The Independent Wednesday,
Summers emphasized the scale of the challenge facing the U.S. and
other governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been considerable repair in recent months, but there
are still very important challenges,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would not characterize himself as an optimist.
``World growth is likely to be considerably lower than it has been
in recent years. There is a lot for policymakers to do.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the preoccupations of the U.S. Administration that
emerged at the recent gathering of the World Economic Forum in
Davos was the reliance of the rest of the world on the American
economy, the only significant engine of growth at present.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges is ensuring that the world economy flies
on multiple engines, not just the U.S.,'' said Summers.
</P>
<P>
   He echoed the view expressed by Al Gore, the U.S. Vice
President, that American consumers and companies could not act as
importers of last resort for the rest of the world. The strength of
U.S. growth set against the rest of the world's is helping to send
the country's balance of payments into record deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he thought other G7 countries were doing too
little to stimulate their own growth rates, Summers added: ``The
important priority in both Japan and Europe has to be domestic,
demand-led growth. The use of macroeconomic policies to achieve
that is important, and they must carry through on that agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   He was careful not to predict that the successive waves of
financial and economic crisis were now over, and in particular
remained cautious about prospects for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the IMF-led rescue for Brazil now depends on the
government's ability to implement budget reforms _ tax increases
and spending cuts _ in the face of political opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil's policy choices, the choices made by the government
and people of Brazil, will be profoundly important, and certainly
also to the U.S.,'' Summers said.
</P>
<P>
   One lesson of the turmoil in emerging markets that started in
Mexico at the end of 1994, and reemerged in east Asia in mid-1997
was, he concluded, that good economic policies, in the sense of
sound money, low budget deficits and structural reforms, do work.
</P>
<P>
   ``When countries are able to implement good policies, then, like
Korea and Thailand, they have started to recover.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of successive crises had also set clear
priorities for reforms to the international ``financial
architecture.'' At the top of the list was improved transparency.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the American capital markets, the most important single
innovation was the idea of generally accepted accounting
principles,'' he said. The spread of these principles ``has the
potential to bring about far-reaching cultural change.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, better banking supervision and regulation would be
needed. Summers said the Basle capital standards, set by the Bank
for International Settlements, would be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   Thirdly, the international authorities needed better systems of
crisis response.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether such detailed changes would satisfy the critics _
like George Soros _ who argue that the world financial system has
fundamentally broken down and needs sweeping reform, he replied:
``These are serious and technical matters, but they are very
profound.''
</P>
<P>
   However, speaking hours before the U.S. Federal Reserve decided
to announce its decision to leave U.S. interest rates unchanged
this month, Summers was considerably less gloomy about the outlook
for the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic momentum of the U.S. expansion should be
maintained,'' he said, ``albeit with some ups and downs. The
economy is growing rapidly, inflation is low, the banking system is
well capitalized and there is great flexibility. It gives the
economy the ability to respond well to any shocks.''
</P>
<P>
   There were two important priorities for the U.S., in his
diagnosis. One was working to combat inequality, the achilles heel
of the remarkable success of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   The other was raising the saving rate, which has fallen to zero
for the household sector. The private sector as a whole has a
record financial deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Summers admitted, somewhat reluctantly, that he saw some merit
in the ``new economy'' argument that new technology had improved
the country's underlying performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``New developments in information technology are very important,
and there's no question we seem to be in a period when normal rates
of unemployment have fallen and normal rates of growth have
risen.'' But he went on: ``These are real changes but it would be a
mistake to assume they will be permanent changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, I am increasingly convinced information technology will
change the way the economy works.'' &QL;

ROCK PIONEER REMEMBERED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
( EDS, identifies Iowa town in 4th graf., makes boombox one word.) 
BY PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the 40th anniversary of Ritchie Valens' death,
his aunt Ernestine Reyes paid a quiet visit Wednesday to his grave
to honor the Pacoima native, a rock pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still hurts, but not as much as it hurt in the beginning,''
said Reyes, who was joined by several other relatives at San
Fernando Cemetery. ``Now we think more about helping other people
remember him, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory of Valens has remained strong across the San Fernando
Valley and elsewhere since his death on Feb. 3, 1959, at age 17, in
a plane crash that also took the lives of Buddy Holly and J.P.
``The Big Bopper'' Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives reported that the 40th anniversary brought a
larger-than-normal crowd to the small Iowa town of Clear Lake,
where the plane carrying the performers crashed.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes' guitar-playing son, Ernie, sang and played in the
traveling concert that stopped at most of the ballrooms and concert
halls that Valens, Holly and Richardson visited during their
ill-fated ``Winter Dance Party.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He sounds just like Ritchie,'' Reyes said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the big effort to preserve Valens' memory is the
drive to get him inducted to the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Valens' relatives, friends and his record label cleared a major
hurdle last summer when their postcard campaign boosted Valens to
the 15-member nomination list for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Class of 1999 was announced in November, Valens
hadn't made the final cut, which included Bruce Springsteen, Billy
Joel and Paul McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Keane, who was Valens' manager at Del-Fi Records, hopes to
hear better news this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been yelling at them for years,'' Keane said. ``I think
they're just starting to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Closer to Valens' home, relatives said their annual birthday
celebration is set for May 8 at Ritchie Valens Recreation Center in
Pacoima.
</P>
<P>
   Since Valens became eligible for a Hall of Fame nomination in
1983, his popularity has clearly been on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``La Bamba,'' a major motion picture about the young Latino
singer born Richard Valenzuela, came out in 1987. He received a
star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1990. A commemorative stamp
was released in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But his life ended as his career began _ Valens was on his first
major tour when he died _ leaving a far smaller catalog than other
nominees who had decades to put a body of work together.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem I've heard that's holding him back is that he was
only around for nine months,'' Keane said. ``Considering what he
did in those nine months, I would think it's all the more reason to
put him in the Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Reyes and other relatives placed flowers on his grave, played
his songs on a small boom box. They noted that the parties
surrounding Valens' birthday and the date of his death have been
getting bigger and bigger over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest celebration ever, they hope, will come before the
end of 1999. ``My last wish is that they put him in the (Rock 'n'
Roll) Hall of Fame,'' said Ernestine Reyes, Valens' aunt. ``That's
going to be the biggest party of all.''

JUGGLING THE INTERNET'S SPLIT PERSONALITIES

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet played a role in a criminal case late last year,
enabling would-be suicides to obtain poison from a home page on the
Net and have it shipped by a home delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the turn of the year, there was another criminal
case in which a young man, getting in touch with young women via a
phone voice-mail service, drugged them and left them to die. He,
too, found his drugs on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These were dark and saddening cases. As a researcher concerned
with the makeup of networks, I found them shocking and
thought-provoking. But it would be premature to say just because of
those cases that the Net is a dreadful thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are two sides _ bright and shadowy sides _ to the
Internet. The question is how to get along with them.
</P>
<P>
   The real world has laws and policemen. But the virtual world of
the Internet, for the present, is a lawless land, with no laws and
no policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Is there no way to regulate such dangerous information on the
Net?
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the acceptability of Net information can be
checked at two levels _ at the transmission level and the user
level.
</P>
<P>
   Checking at the transmission level entails reading the substance
of messages. This involves the difficulty of deciphering coded
information and risks violating the confidentiality of
communications. For these reasons, the idea is hard to implement.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Communications Decency Act that took
effect in February 1996 with the aim of regulating ``coarse
information'' on the Internet was ruled illegal by the Federal
Supreme Court in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As for checking at the user level, providers have drafted
regulations on a voluntary basis and secured the consent of home
page owners. They must pledge not to interfere in peoples' lives or
to behave unethically.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to check all home pages since there are so
many of them, and many change their contents daily.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of imposing legal controls to cope with Net
crimes is under study at home and abroad, enlightened
self-censorship is the only course that is likely to show effect
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Relevant American organizations issued warnings last year
against accessing Web sites that demanded exorbitant fees for their
service, and about a sharp increase in swindles involving
retirement allowances.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the National Consumer Information Center last spring
released preliminary figures on problems consumers had encountered
related to transactions on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is certain to become part of the social
infrastructure in the 21st century. The following four points
should serve as a yardstick for introducing regulations to make it
a system that can be used without fear.
</P>
<P>
   First, the kind of rules that reflect the real world's laws
should be established _ rules that have stronger binding power than
a code of ethics, enforced by punitive provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Because of national borders and cultural barriers, working out
such rules is a tough proposition. They will have to be drawn up
through a process of starting with matters that are close at hand
and going through a repeated process of trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, a mechanism for monitoring adherence to the rules
should be established. It should be a stronger system for
surveillance than the voluntary regulations of providers.
</P>
<P>
   Such surveillance will require the technology to send Internet
police _ some form of ``virtual'' police officers _ patrolling
through cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Under such surveillance, it will become possible to regulate
home pages parents want to keep out of the sight of their children.
With no regulations in place now, elementary and junior high school
children can look at anything.
</P>
<P>
   Thirdly, schoolchildren should be taught information and
communications ethics as part of moral education from the early
years of elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a good idea to teach such ethics in the time set aside
for ``comprehensive study,'' provided for in the new course of
study that the Education Ministry proposes to implement after 2002.
</P>
<P>
   It is too late to try teaching such ethics to adults.
</P>
<P>
   Fourthly, appropriate Net counselling offices should be opened
to help those who are about to lost themselves to a dangerous
degree in the virtual world of the Internet as they try to escape
reality.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the fact that telephone counselling offices and
counselors make themselves helpful in the real world, the
establishment of such services on the Net seems essential if only
to prevent a recurrence of cases where poison is acquired over the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas are offered mainly with the aim of promoting the
introduction of regulations. On the other hand, some enthusiasts
believe that the Internet should be kept free of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   What is necessary now is to work for the creation of a forum
where representatives of the two schools can explore a better
direction in which to move.
</P>
<P>

report of news, features and distinctive analysis is culled from
The Asahi Shimbun, Japan's foremost newspaper, renowned for its
integrity and thoroughness (with a daily circulation is 12
million.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Internet played a role in a criminal case late last year,
enabling would-be suicides to obtain poison from a home page on the
Net and have it shipped by a home delivery service.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after the turn of the year, there was another criminal
case in which a young man, getting in touch with young women via a
phone voice-mail service, drugged them and left them to die. He,
too, found his drugs on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These were dark and saddening cases. As a researcher concerned
with the makeup of networks, I found them shocking and
thought-provoking. But it would be premature to say just because of
those cases that the Net is a dreadful thing.
</P>
<P>
   There are two sides _ bright and shadowy sides _ to the
Internet. The question is how to get along with them.
</P>
<P>
   The real world has laws and policemen. But the virtual world of
the Internet, for the present, is a lawless land, with no laws and
no policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Is there no way to regulate such dangerous information on the
Net?
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, the acceptability of Net information can be
checked at two levels _ at the transmission level and the user
level.
</P>
<P>
   Checking at the transmission level entails reading the substance
of messages. This involves the difficulty of deciphering coded
information and risks violating the confidentiality of
communications. For these reasons, the idea is hard to implement.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Communications Decency Act that took
effect in February 1996 with the aim of regulating ``coarse
information'' on the Internet was ruled illegal by the Federal
Supreme Court in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
   As for checking at the user level, providers have drafted
regulations on a voluntary basis and secured the consent of home
page owners. They must pledge not to interfere in peoples' lives or
to behave unethically.
</P>
<P>
   But it is difficult to check all home pages since there are so
many of them, and many change their contents daily.
</P>
<P>
   While the idea of imposing legal controls to cope with Net
crimes is under study at home and abroad, enlightened
self-censorship is the only course that is likely to show effect
for now.
</P>
<P>
   Relevant American organizations issued warnings last year
against accessing Web sites that demanded exorbitant fees for their
service, and about a sharp increase in swindles involving
retirement allowances.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, the National Consumer Information Center last spring
released preliminary figures on problems consumers had encountered
related to transactions on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is certain to become part of the social
infrastructure in the 21st century. The following four points
should serve as a yardstick for introducing regulations to make it
a system that can be used without fear.
</P>
<P>
   First, the kind of rules that reflect the real world's laws
should be established _ rules that have stronger binding power than
a code of ethics, enforced by punitive provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Because of national borders and cultural barriers, working out
such rules is a tough proposition. They will have to be drawn up
through a process of starting with matters that are close at hand
and going through a repeated process of trial and error.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, a mechanism for monitoring adherence to the rules
should be established. It should be a stronger system for
surveillance than the voluntary regulations of providers.
</P>
<P>
   Such surveillance will require the technology to send Internet
police _ some form of ``virtual'' police officers _ patrolling
through cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   Under such surveillance, it will become possible to regulate
home pages parents want to keep out of the sight of their children.
With no regulations in place now, elementary and junior high school
children can look at anything.
</P>
<P>
   Thirdly, schoolchildren should be taught information and
communications ethics as part of moral education from the early
years of elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a good idea to teach such ethics in the time set aside
for ``comprehensive study,'' provided for in the new course of
study that the Education Ministry proposes to implement after 2002.
</P>
<P>
   It is too late to try teaching such ethics to adults.
</P>
<P>
   Fourthly, appropriate Net counselling offices should be opened
to help those who are about to lost themselves to a dangerous
degree in the virtual world of the Internet as they try to escape
reality.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the fact that telephone counselling offices and
counselors make themselves helpful in the real world, the
establishment of such services on the Net seems essential if only
to prevent a recurrence of cases where poison is acquired over the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas are offered mainly with the aim of promoting the
introduction of regulations. On the other hand, some enthusiasts
believe that the Internet should be kept free of regulations.
</P>
<P>
   What is necessary now is to work for the creation of a forum
where representatives of the two schools can explore a better
direction in which to move.
</P>
<P>
   For those who live in the real world, the Internet is a
convenient instrument that offers a virtual world. The question is
how each of us will acquire the wisdom to get along with the bright
and shadowy sides of the Net.
</P>
<P>
   How we address this task holds the key to the creation of a
healthy information society in the 21st century.  &LR;  &QL;

   All across the Arab world, age and sickness haunt the lands.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's King Hussein lies gravely ill in an American hospital.
Saudi Arabia's King Fahd can barely stand, and stumbles on the
simplest sentences. Yasser Arafat suffers ever more from the brain
tumor inflicted after a near-fatal air crash. Syria's Hafez Assad
suffers from a heart condition, and has lost his heir-apparent son,
Basil, in a road accident. Egypt's Hosni Mubarak has never
appointed a vice-president, let alone a successor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Succession'': it's the Middle East's unspoken crisis. The
great unmentionable. But it is real.
</P>
<P>
   We in the West, of course, accept the Arab world's odd,
dangerous system of inheritance. Why? Because we like
dictatorships. We know how to do business with the kings and
generals _ how to sell them our arms, fighter-bombers and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that we, as well as the Arab regimes themselves,
have produced and maintained this archaic drama of crown princes
and beloved sons, of gulf sheikhdoms that are no more than the
private property of individual families...

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most American borrowers _ which is to say most American
homeowners _ down is up.
</P>
<P>
   However, the financial markets perform in the coming year, it's
very likely that the biggest financial opportunity for U.S.
consumers in 1999 will be the refinancing of their homes via the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The math explains why mortgage lenders and brokers are swamped
with applications. The rate on a refinanced mortgage is likely to
be at least 160 basis points (1.6 percentage points) lower than the
original mortgage rate, approximately the yield on the stocks in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Stock Index.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the principal amount of the typical home mortgage
equals about two years' worth of the owner's income. Closing costs
average about 2 percent of the face value of the mortgage, or about
two weeks' salary.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, refinancing a mortgage is like investing two weeks' salary
to collect the dividends on a portfolio worth more than two years'
salary _ with no risk.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, a refinancing is as good as a salary increase for
most borrowers. Maybe better. While the major benefits-consulting
firms were forecasting 4.5 percent raises for 1999 only a few
months ago, economic angst may dampen that figure.
</P>
<P>
   But millions of homeowners will be able to increase their
spending power by more than 3 percent by refinancing _ even more if
they roll consumer debt into the new loan.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers still have to deal with lenders, alas, and their
endless and intrusive requests for information. But at least the
Net brings some welcome anonymity to the seven-step process,
described below:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SCOUTING THE MARKET &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Before the Internet, the mortgage market consisted of whatever
the local lender or broker had to offer. But the Web allows
consumers to shop among mortgage lenders, comparing rates, fees,
maturities, and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the Federal Reserve site
(www.bog.frb.fed.us/releases). Download the ``historical data''
version of release H.15 to see if rates have risen or fallen in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Median home prices in cities across the country are available
through the ``NAR Press Releases'' link at www.realtimes.com.
Real-estate-information publisher HSH (www.hsh.com) features a
three-year graph of typical mortgage rates, a collection of
calculators, and a regularly updated report on average rates.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to compare what specific lenders are offering is
through the Web sites of mortgage brokers, most of which do
business with several lenders around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most active brokers are HomeShark (www.homeshark.com),
E-Loan (www.eloan.com), and QuickenMortgage
(www.quickenmortgage.com).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHECKING CREDIT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates depend largely on the borrower's credit rating.
Quick credit tests can be found at www.mortgage-net.com and
www.hsh.com. And consumers can obtain a copy of their credit report
from www.creditreport-net.com.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest taking the test and foregoing the report: One of the
markdowns in credit scoring systems is the number of credit
inquiries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOOSING THE MORTGAGE YOU WANT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, home mortgages came in one flavor: 30 years,
fixed rate. Now maturities on fixed-rate loans range from 15 to 30,
and rates can be fixed or vary according to changes in one of three
common indexes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are balloon notes payable in three, five, or
seven years and adjustable thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage world is further subdivided into ``conforming''
loans (which carry principal amounts of $227,150 or less and are
eligible to be pooled and turned into tradable securities) and
``jumbo,'' or nonconforming, loans (which carry higher principal
amounts and interest rates).
</P>
<P>
   These days, fixed-rate mortgages have it all over
adjustable-rate mortgages. Adjustable-rate borrowers, after a
brief, low-rate introductory period, pay about 7.46 percent at a
time when fixed-rate borrowers are paying 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new combination instruments also look pretty dubious right
about now, so homeowners should spend most of their search
comparing 15- and 30-year fixed-rate loans.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers can shorten the terms by increasing the amount they
pay each month _ an idea popularized by Marc Eisenson in his book,
``The Banker's Secret,'' which can be ordered at
www.goodadvicepress.com.
</P>
<P>
   But most people hear about a money-grubbing variant on the idea,
the biweekly mortgage, hyped at www.usmr.com. I challenged the hype
in a newspaper column, archived at www.scottburns.com/980614su.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DETERMINING FEES AND EXPENSES &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most lenders on the Web now provide potential borrowers with a
list of closing fees and expenses. Make sure you comparison shop _
not all of these lenders underprice conventional lenders.
</P>
<P>
   HomeShark is one that aims to cut about $1,000 out of the
standard mortgage cost and pass the savings along to the borrower.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUALIFYING FOR THE LOAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A borrower now making a mortgage payment of $1,000 a month
should easily qualify for a new mortgage with a lower monthly
payment, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The problem, at least with conforming loans, is often
something called the back-end ratio. This is the total of a
borrower's mortgage, home insurance, and real-estate tax payments
(which are usually limited to 28 percent of gross income), plus all
other fixed commitments _ car loans, credit-card debt, child
support, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The combined total is limited to 36 percent of gross income. In
other words, non-home-buying commitments can't exceed 8 percent of
gross income. If they do, the mortgage amount is reduced
proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to exceed 8 percent. Consider a two-earner
couple with a combined income of $100,000 who are financing two
$25,000 cars for five years at 8 percent. Their total monthly
payments will be $1,014 a month, or 12.2 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   Add two credit-card balances of, say, $2,000 and minimum monthly
payments of $40 each, and they've lost another 1 percent. (Strictly
speaking, most lenders look at 10 months' worth of payments or so
to estimate the level of monthly installment debt.)
</P>
<P>
   With all these pitfalls, it's a good thing the Web is loaded
with qualification calculators. Two good ones can be found at
www.financecenter.com/calcs.html and www.interest.com/hugh/calc.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASSEMBLING DOCUMENTATION &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   No two ways about it, this is a headache. A checklist of the
required items can be found at www.hsh.com, and it's a bit
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Where are those W-2s? Where did last month's bank statement get
to? The load is even worse for the self-employed, who need at least
two years' worth of personal tax returns as well as their most
recent corporate tax returns and profit-and-loss statements.
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Make a numbered list of documents, number the
documents, and make a complete copy of the application package.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; APPLYING AND CLOSING &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This is the easy part, comparatively speaking. Computers have
accelerated the decision-making process, so an answer _ an
affirmative answer, we hope _ should be forthcoming in short
order. &QL;

   Before the Internet, the mortgage market consisted of whatever
the local lender or broker had to offer. But the Web allows
consumers to shop among mortgage lenders, comparing rates, fees,
maturities, and restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is the Federal Reserve site
(www.bog.frb.fed.us/releases). Download the ``historical data''
version of release H.15 to see if rates have risen or fallen in
recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Median home prices in cities across the country are available
through the ``NAR Press Releases'' link at www.realtimes.com.
Real-estate-information publisher HSH (www.hsh.com) features a
three-year graph of typical mortgage rates, a collection of
calculators, and a regularly updated report on average rates.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to compare what specific lenders are offering is
through the Web sites of mortgage brokers, most of which do
business with several lenders around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most active brokers are HomeShark (www.homeshark.com),
E-Loan (www.eloan.com), and QuickenMortgage
(www.quickenmortgage.com).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHECKING CREDIT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Mortgage rates depend largely on the borrower's credit rating.
Quick credit tests can be found at www.mortgage-net.com and
www.hsh.com. And consumers can obtain a copy of their credit report
from www.creditreport-net.com.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest taking the test and foregoing the report: One of the
markdowns in credit scoring systems is the number of credit
inquiries in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CHOOSING THE MORTGAGE YOU WANT &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, home mortgages came in one flavor: 30 years,
fixed rate. Now maturities on fixed-rate loans range from 15 to 30,
and rates can be fixed or vary according to changes in one of three
common indexes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are balloon notes payable in three, five, or
seven years and adjustable thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   The mortgage world is further subdivided into ``conforming''
loans (which carry principal amounts of $227,150 or less and are
eligible to be pooled and turned into tradable securities) and
``jumbo,'' or nonconforming, loans (which carry higher principal
amounts and interest rates).
</P>
<P>
   These days, fixed-rate mortgages have it all over
adjustable-rate mortgages. Adjustable-rate borrowers, after a
brief, low-rate introductory period, pay about 7.46 percent at a
time when fixed-rate borrowers are paying 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The new combination instruments also look pretty dubious right
about now, so homeowners should spend most of their search
comparing 15- and 30-year fixed-rate loans.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers can shorten the terms by increasing the amount they
pay each month _ an idea popularized by Marc Eisenson in his book,
``The Banker's Secret,'' which can be ordered at
www.goodadvicepress.com.
</P>
<P>
   But most people hear about a money-grubbing variant on the idea,
the biweekly mortgage, hyped at www.usmr.com. I challenged the hype
in a newspaper column, archived at www.scottburns.com/980614su.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DETERMINING FEES AND EXPENSES &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most lenders on the Web now provide potential borrowers with a
list of closing fees and expenses. Make sure you comparison shop _
not all of these lenders underprice conventional lenders.
</P>
<P>
   HomeShark is one that aims to cut about $1,000 out of the
standard mortgage cost and pass the savings along to the borrower.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUALIFYING FOR THE LOAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   A borrower now making a mortgage payment of $1,000 a month
should easily qualify for a new mortgage with a lower monthly
payment, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong. The problem, at least with conforming loans, is often
something called the back-end ratio. This is the total of a
borrower's mortgage, home insurance, and real-estate tax payments
(which are usually limited to 28 percent of gross income), plus all
other fixed commitments _ car loans, credit-card debt, child
support, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   The combined total is limited to 36 percent of gross income. In
other words, non-home-buying commitments can't exceed 8 percent of
gross income. If they do, the mortgage amount is reduced
proportionately.
</P>
<P>
   It's not difficult to exceed 8 percent. Consider a two-earner
couple with a combined income of $100,000 who are financing two
$25,000 cars for five years at 8 percent. Their total monthly
payments will be $1,014 a month, or 12.2 percent of income.
</P>
<P>
   Add two credit-card balances of, say, $2,000 and minimum monthly
payments of $40 each, and they've lost another 1 percent. (Strictly
speaking, most lenders look at 10 months' worth of payments or so
to estimate the level of monthly installment debt.)
</P>
<P>
   With all these pitfalls, it's a good thing the Web is loaded
with qualification calculators. Two good ones can be found at
www.financecenter.com/calcs.html and www.interest.com/hugh/calc.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ASSEMBLING DOCUMENTATION &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   No two ways about it, this is a headache. A checklist of the
required items can be found at www.hsh.com, and it's a bit
daunting.
</P>
<P>
   Where are those W-2s? Where did last month's bank statement get
to? The load is even worse for the self-employed, who need at least
two years' worth of personal tax returns as well as their most
recent corporate tax returns and profit-and-loss statements.
</P>
<P>
   My advice: Make a numbered list of documents, number the
documents, and make a complete copy of the application package.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; APPLYING AND CLOSING &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   This is the easy part, comparatively speaking. Computers have
accelerated the decision-making process, so an answer _ an
affirmative answer, we hope _ should be forthcoming in short
order. &QL;

<P>
   As a shopper, no matter how high your credit-card limit, there
is one thing you almost never have: perfect information. Is $521
the best deal on that Nikon? You'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   Or will you? Visit CNET's Shopper.com, enter the description of
a product you're looking to buy, and in seconds you'll have a list
of stores that carry the item.
</P>
<P>
   Not just any list, but a shopping mega-list _ database-driven
and info-packed _ that's almost certain to save you time and money.
The list tells you what you'll pay at retailers from Irvine,
Calif., to Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, $521 is not the best price on that Nikon digital
camera, the Coolpix 600. Shopper.com lists 25 stores that carry the
product, as well as each store's phone number and location, the
approximate shipping cost, and the product's availability.
</P>
<P>
   One store wants $498.95, while another _ a popular mail-order
retailer _ wants $599.95. Complete information, or something close
to it. A shopper's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Think of Shopper.com and its brethren, the Web's
comparison-shopping sites, as search engines for products and, more
importantly, prices at far-flung merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Computers, books, CDs, toys, home electronics _ all the major
products peddled on the Web can be found at one of the
comparison-shopping sites, from Bottom Dollar to Robo Shopper.
</P>
<P>
   For price and convenience (those mantras of the serious
shopper), these sites just can't be beat, especially during the
holiday season, when mall frenzy disrupts suburban traffic patterns
and lines twist around cash registers in a consumption-crazed
version of Dante's ``Inferno.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if you don't buy any products online, you can use these
sites to compare prices with those at your local retailer.
</P>
<P>
   That said, a few caveats are still in order:
</P>
<P>
   l) Avoid sites that list prices for only a few merchants. Either
the site's database is puny or, worse, the site charges merchants
to be listed. ``That's ultimately limiting,'' says James McQuivey,
an analyst at Forrester Research. ``The consumer will eventually
learn he's getting something that's fundamentally at odds with the
value the Internet provides.''
</P>
<P>
   2) Beware of stale information. The best sites reveal when a
price was last updated. Always confirm the price by phone or at the
merchant's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   3) Even at sites that don't charge merchants for listings,
expect some intermingling of objective information with
advertisements. At Shopper.com, the initial sale list places
sponsors at the top. Does that help you? Not at all. Choose the
``Re-sort by Price'' link.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes comparison shopping is integrated into search engines,
as at Excite. More common are stand-alone comparison-shopping
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In a year or two, expect to see comparison shopping everywhere
you turn on the Web: portal sites like Yahoo!, news and
entertainment sites, even personal home pages.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, these sites will provide entirely new ways of
deciding what to buy, allowing you to generate detailed
side-by-side comparisons, read customer reviews, and otherwise
match your desires with the right product.
</P>
<P>

   Sometimes comparison shopping is integrated into search engines,
as at Excite. More common are stand-alone comparison-shopping
sites.
</P>
<P>
   In a year or two, expect to see comparison shopping everywhere
you turn on the Web: portal sites like Yahoo!, news and
entertainment sites, even personal home pages.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, these sites will provide entirely new ways of
deciding what to buy, allowing you to generate detailed
side-by-side comparisons, read customer reviews, and otherwise
match your desires with the right product.

   Who besides Dr. Seuss's Grinch would impose a penalty on gift
giving? The U.S. government, of course, which makes sure that the
generous have to worry about not just income taxes but gift taxes
as well.
</P>
<P>
   An unpleasant light was briefly shone on the tax treatment of
gifts last year when baseball fans began wondering aloud whether
someone who gave St. Louis Cardinals slugger Mark McGwire back his
62nd-home-run ball would be liable for a gift tax.
</P>
<P>
   Proving just how tricky gift-tax rules can be, the IRS made two
different statements within 48 hours about tax liability. At first
the donor owed big time, then he or she was off the hook. The ball
was retrieved by an employee of the Cardinals, ending the debate.
</P>
<P>
   For people making more prosaic gifts, there are still several
considerations to keep in mind.
</P>
<P>
   If you give any one person a gift worth more than $10,000, you
will have to file a gift-tax return. But that doesn't mean you'll
actually have to pay tax on the gift this year. Instead, the effect
of the gift tax will be to reduce the amount (currently $625,000)
that can be transferred free of estate tax at the time of your
death.
</P>
<P>
   You can give up to $10,000 to an unlimited number of people
without worrying about gift tax. If you're married, you and your
spouse can give $20,000 to any individual without having to file a
gift-tax return, but you must file Form 709 to notify the IRS of
the ``split gift.''
</P>
<P>
   One other goody: There's no limit on the size of your gift if
it's for tuition or medical care. So feel free to pick up the cost
of your grandchild's Ivy League education. You'll want to be sure
to write the check to the institution, though, and not to the
individual.
</P>
<P>
   You may want to give a child or other relative non-appreciating
assets, such as cash, instead of appreciating assets like stocks.
Reason: Whoever receives your gift of an appreciating asset will
have the same cost basis that you had.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you bought $1,000 worth of stock that is now worth $7,000,
the recipient of that gift will have to pay income tax on
everything above $1,000 when the stock is sold,'' says Ed O'Hanlon,
a certified public accountant in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you hold the stock until you die, the recipient will
get it with a stepped-up basis _ that is, the value of the stock at
your death. If you're not otherwise subject to estate taxes, that
can be a better deal for the person you want to have the stock.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you are going to have a large estate,
making a gift of an appreciating asset can be beneficial in the
long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get that future appreciation out of your estate,'' says
Bruno Graziano, senior analyst with tax-guide publisher CCH. ``The
appreciation will be taxable to the recipient, but that tax could
be less than the tax your estate might have to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   If you give someone a painting, jewelry, or other rarity, you'll
need to have it appraised. ``I would recommend getting three
independent appraisals and going with the middle or average of the
three,'' says Mark Rigotti, a CPA in Taylor, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The appraisal value _ which should be the amount for which you
could sell the item on the open market _ is the amount you will
declare on any gift-tax return.
</P>
<P>
   The best news of all: There are no gift taxes on contributions
to qualified charities. Happy donating.  &LR;  &QL;

 By DAVE CALIFANO  
 c.1999 Worth Magazine  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A dead-in-the-water stock investment is no fun. But when you own
more than 17 percent of the stock in question, at least you get to
punish somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, when it became clear that the aggressive growth
projections trumpeted by Sunbeam chief Albert Dunlap were just so
much balloon juice, money manager Michael Price demanded Dunlap's
swollen head. And Price's 17.5 million Sunbeam shares ensured that
he got it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about smaller investors? In absolute terms, they may
not have as much at stake as a major player like Price, but their
losses can be just as painful, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   Do they stand a chance of making their voices heard when they
think one of their companies is being mismanaged?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, yes. Just ask Nell Minow, a principal in
Lens, an activist investment fund based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, Lens was the extremely dissatisfied owner of a
tiny percentage of Sears, Roebuck stock. The source of Minow's
discontent: the Sears board, which essentially stood by while the
company frittered away its franchise as Middle America's retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up, Lens took out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal
accusing Sears's directors, by name, of being ``non-performing
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the ad ran, Sears held its annual meeting, where
a stunningly large percentage of the company's normally docile
stockholders endorsed Minow's plan to return the Big Store to its
retailing roots.
</P>
<P>
   She proposed that the company jettison its Dean Witter
financial-services arm and its Coldwell Banker real-estate unit. In
1993, Sears did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Minow's tactics aren't usually so flashy or brash, but they all
are designed to send the same message. ``Everything I do is to let
the company know that it's being observed,'' says Minow. ``Once
this happens, it reacts differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of effective shareholder activism is that
frontal assaults are rarely successful. ``You have to go through
the back door,'' confirms Amy Domini of Domini Social Investments.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite tactics is to introduce resolutions for
shareholders to consider at a company's annual meeting. The best
resolutions are the ones that promise, if passed, to make
management's lives miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll file a resolution on a sensitive matter like management
compensation,'' says Domini, ``and only agree to withdraw it if the
company will speak to us about the issues we're really concerned
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite pressure tactic is what's called the 220 demand
letter. Many companies are incorporated in Delaware because of that
state's pro-management legal code. But one key part of the code is
actually a shareholder's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Under section 220 of Delaware General Corporation Law, investors
can, upon written request, inspect the books and records of any
company whose stock they own.
</P>
<P>
   Lens recently played the 220 card against Juno Lighting, a
company in which Lens holds 721,000 shares. Concerned about the
dearth of outsiders on the company's board, Lens had for months
pressed Juno to appoint several outside directors.
</P>
<P>
   Juno agreed, but the effort proceeded slowly until Minow fired
off a 220 letter demanding to see all records pertaining to the
company's search. Juno subsequently opened a line of communication
with Lens, but Minow hasn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management's credibility is questionable,'' she says, ``and I
am currently drafting a shareholder proposal and preparing for a
proxy fight in case they don't keep their promises. As Reagan said,
`Trust, but verify.'''
</P>
<P>
   Minow expects shareholders to become even more aggressive about
defending their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing is not just about being smart in finding value
anymore,'' she says. ``It's also about being smart in creating
value.'' And if creating value means playing rough sometimes, hey,
that's business. &QL;

KINGS FACING UPHILL BATTLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The first thing Larry Robinson was asked following
practice Wednesday was which of his goalies would play tonight, and
the Kings' coach said in all likelihood it will be Stephane Fiset.
</P>
<P>
   Unprompted, Robinson then added, ``That's the least of my
worries.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Kings (17-28-4) take the ice tonight at the Forum,
they'll be facing the Chicago Blackhawks, their fellow travelers in
the nether region of the NHL's Western Conference. The Blackhawks
played the Mighty Ducks at the Pond on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have lost six of their last seven games, including
three of four on a trip that ended Monday night in Philadelphia.
Amazingly, despite their poor record, a playoff spot remains in
reach. But with 33 games left on the schedule, it is reaching the
point where the Kings are running out of time to begin their surge
into the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tendency when you're not getting results and not
winning hockey games, it's easy to get in a negative attitude,''
Robinson said. ``The positive side is we had a lot of great chances
to score goals (in Philadelphia), but we didn't score. We've got to
get some wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, the Kings are one of eight teams fighting for the
last three playoff berths, accompanied in the struggle by the
Blackhawks, Nashville, San Jose, the Mighty Ducks, Edmonton,
Calgary and Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will have ample opportunity to control their fate,
with 16 of their remaining games against those teams, including
five of the next eight and 11 of the next 19.
</P>
<P>
   Win a majority of those games, and the Kings will be in good
shape. Lose a majority of those games, or break even, and it
probably will be time to start thinking about next season. But for
the Kings to start winning, they must do a better job of limiting
turnovers in the offensive zone _ a habit that has been costing
them defensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see is when we're not committed to finishing our
checks, bang, the damn thing is in our net,'' Robinson said. ``Or
we're getting beat one-on-one, or we're getting caught with three
guys behind the net. Things like that are killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   So is an offense that was held to two goals or less on three of
the four games on the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get ugly goals,'' Robinson said. ``We don't seem
to get that many. We're getting traffic in front of the net, but we
don't get the second and third shots off rebounds, and those are
the shots that go in. We're playing well enough. We should have a
few more wins. It gets discouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosy return: Kings defenseman Garry Galley played in his 1,000th
NHL game in Monday night's loss in Philadelphia, and after the
game, he and his teammates returned to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived home, he was greeted by a surprise from his
wife, Terri Lynn: an assortment of vases containing 1,000 roses.
Galley's children (daughter Shaylynn and son Wyatt) gave their
father portraits of themselves wearing Kings sweaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really special, something I'll always remember,
something I'll cherish,'' Galley said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had another 1,000 games in him, Galley laughed and
said, ``Looking back on 15 years, that's how long it took me to get
to 1,000, so I'm just going to take them one at a time. I just want
to continue to play well and play for as long as I can. When it's
over, it's over, so I want to enjoy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's game also was defenseman Rob Blake's 500th in the NHL.
Coincidentally, the 35-year-old Galley and the 29-year-old Blake
both played college hockey at Bowling Green.

<P>
   A dead-in-the-water stock investment is no fun. But when you own
more than 17 percent of the stock in question, at least you get to
punish somebody.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, when it became clear that the aggressive growth
projections trumpeted by Sunbeam chief Albert Dunlap were just so
much balloon juice, money manager Michael Price demanded Dunlap's
swollen head. And Price's 17.5 million Sunbeam shares ensured that
he got it.
</P>
<P>
   But what about smaller investors? In absolute terms, they may
not have as much at stake as a major player like Price, but their
losses can be just as painful, if not more so.
</P>
<P>
   Do they stand a chance of making their voices heard when they
think one of their companies is being mismanaged?
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly enough, yes. Just ask Nell Minow, a principal in
Lens, an activist investment fund based in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, Lens was the extremely dissatisfied owner of a
tiny percentage of Sears, Roebuck stock. The source of Minow's
discontent: the Sears board, which essentially stood by while the
company frittered away its franchise as Middle America's retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Fed up, Lens took out a full-page ad in The Wall Street Journal
accusing Sears's directors, by name, of being ``non-performing
assets.''
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the ad ran, Sears held its annual meeting, where
a stunningly large percentage of the company's normally docile
stockholders endorsed Minow's plan to return the Big Store to its
retailing roots.
</P>
<P>
   She proposed that the company jettison its Dean Witter
financial-services arm and its Coldwell Banker real-estate unit. In
1993, Sears did just that.
</P>
<P>
   Minow's tactics aren't usually so flashy or brash, but they all
are designed to send the same message. ``Everything I do is to let
the company know that it's being observed,'' says Minow. ``Once
this happens, it reacts differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Another principle of effective shareholder activism is that
frontal assaults are rarely successful. ``You have to go through
the back door,'' confirms Amy Domini of Domini Social Investments.
</P>
<P>
   One of her favorite tactics is to introduce resolutions for
shareholders to consider at a company's annual meeting. The best
resolutions are the ones that promise, if passed, to make
management's lives miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll file a resolution on a sensitive matter like management
compensation,'' says Domini, ``and only agree to withdraw it if the
company will speak to us about the issues we're really concerned
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Another favorite pressure tactic is what's called the 220 demand
letter. Many companies are incorporated in Delaware because of that
state's pro-management legal code. But one key part of the code is
actually a shareholder's best friend.
</P>
<P>
   Under section 220 of Delaware General Corporation Law, investors
can, upon written request, inspect the books and records of any
company whose stock they own.
</P>
<P>
   Lens recently played the 220 card against Juno Lighting, a
company in which Lens holds 721,000 shares. Concerned about the
dearth of outsiders on the company's board, Lens had for months
pressed Juno to appoint several outside directors.
</P>
<P>
   Juno agreed, but the effort proceeded slowly until Minow fired
off a 220 letter demanding to see all records pertaining to the
company's search. Juno subsequently opened a line of communication
with Lens, but Minow hasn't let up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management's credibility is questionable,'' she says, ``and I
am currently drafting a shareholder proposal and preparing for a
proxy fight in case they don't keep their promises. As Reagan said,
`Trust, but verify.'''
</P>
<P>
   Minow expects shareholders to become even more aggressive about
defending their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investing is not just about being smart in finding value
anymore,'' she says. ``It's also about being smart in creating
value.'' And if creating value means playing rough sometimes, hey,
that's business. &QL;

LOYOLA UPSETS PEPPERDINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was no margin for error and Pepperdine erred
in a big, lazy way.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves' hope was to meet frontrunning Gonzaga in two weeks in
a war that would settle the top seed in the West Coast Conference
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Waves require unforeseen and unexpected help after
failing terribly on defense in a 90-77 loss to Loyola Marymount on
Wednesday at Gersten Pavilion in the 125th meeting between the
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves, who had a six-game winning streak ended, could get a
smidge of a revenge when the schools meet again Saturday in Malibu.
But without a loss by 25th-ranked Gonzaga (18-4, 8-0 WCC) before
the aforementioned Feb. 19 clash, a win against LMU would serve as
little consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we tried to approach that before (Wednesday) was if no
one beat Gonzaga that was all right because we have a chance to
beat them,'' Pepperdine coach Lorenzo Romar said. ``But now, you
have to play your game, but at the same time in the back of your
mind you are wondering, `Will they lose a game?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The way Bulldogs have plowed through conference play to this
juncture, that doesn't look likely. Gonzaga has won seven of its
conference games by nine points or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unfortunate that it's come down to this,''
Pepperdine senior forward Marc McDowell said. ``But if we keep
playing like we did here, it won't make much difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In what was clearly a battle of styles _ Pepperdine's defense
against LMU's run-and-gun _ it was the Lions who won out.
</P>
<P>
   Almost to the point where the Waves, the best defensive team in
the league, stopped playing defense in the second half, getting
beat in transition and allowing a plethora of open shots.
</P>
<P>
   LMU, which scored the last four points of the first half to tie
it at 34-34, scored 56 points in the second half. The Lions shot 50
percent from the field and rendered Pepperdine's size advantage
meaningless with it's full-throttle approach. It contributed to the
most points scored against Pepperdine this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You give us a lot of credit when you say (we played) not much
defense,'' Romar said. ``We didn't defend at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Davis and Rupert McClendon both came off the bench to
pace six Lions (10-11, 5-4) in double figures with 16 points
apiece. Jelani Gardner led Pepperdine (16-8, 7-2) with 19 points,
but was forced to play 38 minutes because of ineffective guard
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got caught up in playing up-tempo with them and it got the
best of us because we weren't getting back on defense,'' said
Tommie Prince, usually Pepperdine's defensive stalwart. ``Even when
we did make our shots, we still weren't getting back.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Glubb had disagreed with Hussein over military strategy _ the
young king wanted to retaliate against the Israelis for raids on
his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officers whom he claimed were ``subversives'' and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, it is fair to ask why we were surprised
by the suddenness of the political upheaval in Amman. The
Hashemites have always lived on the edge, provoking disaster and
recovery with a drama and nerve that astonishes other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to move rapidly between rage and
contemplation, political folly and eternal friendship that might be
a characteristic of the Gulf Arabs rather than the Levant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein's family does, indeed, come from the Gulf, from the
province of Hejaz, and it was his great-grandfather (also Hussein)
whom the Ottomans named as emir, sheriff of the holy Muslim city of
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad 10 years later, King Feisel the Second (grandson of
old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine. &QL;

   His English schooling naturally endeared him to the British who
admire courage in adversity. When he married Antoinette Avril
Gardiner, daughter of a Royal Engineers lieutenant colonel, in
1961, it felt as though Jordan had become a British protectorate
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni,'' who became Princess Muna, gave birth to two sons,
Abdullah _ now the crown prince _ and Feisel. She was the second of
four wives for a king whose marriages could be as dramatic and
turbulent as his nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He had divorced his first, older wife Dina within 18 months (the
Jordanian ambassador to Egypt delivered the king's goodbye letter
to the queen when she was visiting a sick relative in Cairo).
</P>
<P>
   The marriage to Toni foundered when his roving eye settled upon
the beautiful Alia Toucan, an employee of Royal Jordanian Airlines,
whose love for the king may have given him lasting peace of mind _
they married in 1972 _ had she not been killed in a helicopter
crash five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he married Lisa Halaby, who became Queen Noor, an
equally beautiful but forceful woman who physically towered over
the king and who developed a strong, and well-founded, distrust of
his introverted, over-intellectualizing brother Hassan (if he had
become king, it was said in Amman, she would have left Jordan). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   With a ruthlessness that has still not been fully acknowledged,
Hussein's Bedouin troops slaughtered their way through the
Palestinian camps of Jordan and crushed guerrilla power.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned from his rash decision to go to war in 1967, he
sat out the 1973 Middle East conflict in near-silence, maintaining
semi-secret contacts with Israeli leaders, just as his grandfather
had done.
</P>

   Long regarded as a pliable ``friend'' of the west, King Hussein
astonished his American allies by embracing Saddam Hussein _ quite
literally _ after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did he really believe
Saddam would ``liberate'' Jerusalem? Or that Jordan could survive
without the Gulf Arabs?
</P>
<P>
   He grew a beard; in Amman, he was called ``Sheriff of Mecca.''
The Saudis were enraged. He appeared to be looking towards lost
lands. He knew the Palestinians would support Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most popular monarch in the Arab world at the very
moment he became the most unpopular monarch in the west.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Americans were ready to roll up the Hashemite
carpet. U.S. newspapers were predicting the end of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But then _ stunned by Yasser Arafat's secret ``peace'' deal with
Israel and himself now politically and economically weakened (an
essential ingredient for any nation wishing to make peace with the
Israelis), the king made his own peace with Yitzhak Shamir and
Shimon Peres.

   The Americans would like Abdullah to host the anti-Saddam Iraqi
opposition in Amman, and encourage him to make a military foray
into western Iraq to create a ``safe haven'' for Saddam's Iraqi
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jordanians, as usual, have been given no role in the
succession. The Hashemites may claim their ancestry back to the
Prophet Muhamed _ as they do _ but they are Tudors rather than
democrats, an oligarchy rather than a modern monarchy, however
liberal and decent they are as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is a tank commander, a proven general of Hussein's
Praetorian Guard. In Amman, they tell you not to be fooled by the
soft smile, that Abdullah is a tough guy. He needs to be if he is
going to inherit his father's formidable mantle. &QL;

DUCKS WIN 3-0

<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Matt Cullen finally made it to the top on Wednesday
night, and he took full advantage of his opportunity in the Mighty
Ducks' 3-0 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks before 15,254 at the
Pond.
</P>
<P>
   After a solid rookie season, Cullen has played on the second,
third and fourth lines this season. He had only 10 points in his
first 41 games, but Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg desperate to snap
his team's five-game winless streak (0-4-1) moved the young center
between Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen responded with a goal and an assist as the Ducks
(18-22-9) won for just the second time in nine games (2-6-1).
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's performance wasn't especially brilliant, but it was
good enough to beat the Western Conference's worst team.
</P>
<P>
   For two periods Chicago controlled much of the play, but it was
the Ducks who took an early lead on Kariya's 21st goal at 3:34 of
the first period. Cullen put then put the Blackhawks away 24
seconds into the third period with his fourth goal of the year
while Anaheim was on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Hebert, seemingly fully recovered from the flu, made those
goals standup by stopping 35 shots and recording his career-high
fifth shutout.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first period was played in Anaheim's defensive zone,
but the Ducks took a 1-0 lead into the second on a goal that had to
make Hartsburg especially happy.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty, but it was just type the Anaheim coach has
been looking for from his team. Cullen deflected Ruslan Salei's
point shot and Kariya was right in front of the net to pick up the
rebound and lift a backhander over Jocelyn Thibault's glove just
before he was knocked to the ice by Jamie Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya's goal was just his third point in the last five games.
The Anaheim captain has led the league in scoring much of the
season, but he now trails Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr, 72-63.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya thought he had another goal midway through the second
period. Kariya found himself wide open in the slot after getting a
pass from Selanne. His wrist shot had Thibault beat cleanly and the
winger began to raise his arms, but the shot hit the crossbar and
stayed out.
</P>
<P>
   While Chicago had the territorial advantage in the first period,
the Blackhawks really had only one good scoring chance and Hebert
got some help from the post on a shot by Todd White, who had blown
around Jason Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   The second period was a different story. Chicago had 15 shots on
goal and several excellent scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
   Hebert had to be sharp and he was -- right from the opening
minute when he made a glove save on White.
</P>
<P>
   The Anaheim goalie also thwarted Nelson Emerson and While --
again -- on point-blank chances about five minutes into the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks failed to score on a brief 27-second two-man advantage
just before the second period ended. But Anaheim's power play unit
scored the crucial goal early in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne got a pass to Cullen in the right circle. The Anaheim
center waited for Chris Chelios to slide by and with all kinds of
time beat Thibault with a shot high over the Chicago goalie's
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, the league's top-ranked power play at home, has scored
at least one power play goal in 23 of 26 games at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   Marty McInnis completed the scoring with an empty net goal with
11.1 seconds left in the third period.

   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Glubb had disagreed with Hussein over military strategy _ the
young king wanted to retaliate against the Israelis for raids on
his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officers whom he claimed were ``subversives'' and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, it is fair to ask why we were surprised
by the suddenness of the political upheaval in Amman. The
Hashemites have always lived on the edge, provoking disaster and
recovery with a drama and nerve that astonishes other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to move rapidly between rage and
contemplation, political folly and eternal friendship that might be
a characteristic of the Gulf Arabs rather than the Levant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein's family does, indeed, come from the Gulf, from the
province of Hejaz, and it was his great-grandfather (also Hussein)
whom the Ottomans named as emir, sheriff of the holy Muslim city of
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.

old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine. &QL;

his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officers whom he claimed were ``subversives'' and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, it is fair to ask why we were surprised
by the suddenness of the political upheaval in Amman. The
Hashemites have always lived on the edge, provoking disaster and
recovery with a drama and nerve that astonishes other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to move rapidly between rage and
contemplation, political folly and eternal friendship that might be
a characteristic of the Gulf Arabs rather than the Levant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein's family does, indeed, come from the Gulf, from the
province of Hejaz, and it was his great-grandfather (also Hussein)
whom the Ottomans named as emir, sheriff of the holy Muslim city of
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad 10 years later, King Feisel the Second (grandson of
old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the story of the Hashemites has become the story of
the Plucky Little King, who now lies dying in the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   His English schooling naturally endeared him to the British who
admire courage in adversity. When he married Antoinette Avril
Gardiner, daughter of a Royal Engineers lieutenant colonel, in
1961, it felt as though Jordan had become a British protectorate
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni,'' who became Princess Muna, gave birth to two sons,
Abdullah _ now the crown prince _ and Feisel. She was the second of
four wives for a king whose marriages could be as dramatic and
turbulent as his nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He had divorced his first, older wife Dina within 18 months (the
Jordanian ambassador to Egypt delivered the king's goodbye letter
to the queen when she was visiting a sick relative in Cairo).
</P>
<P>
   The marriage to Toni foundered when his roving eye settled upon
the beautiful Alia Toucan, an employee of Royal Jordanian Airlines,
whose love for the king may have given him lasting peace of mind _
they married in 1972 _ had she not been killed in a helicopter
crash five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he married Lisa Halaby, who became Queen Noor, an
equally beautiful but forceful woman who physically towered over
the king and who developed a strong, and well-founded, distrust of
his introverted, over-intellectualizing brother Hassan (if he had
become king, it was said in Amman, she would have left Jordan). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Having lost the West Bank, the king had to face the
consequences: Palestinian contempt, and what amounted to an
attempted coup d'etat by Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   With a ruthlessness that has still not been fully acknowledged,
Hussein's Bedouin troops slaughtered their way through the
Palestinian camps of Jordan and crushed guerrilla power.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned from his rash decision to go to war in 1967, he
sat out the 1973 Middle East conflict in near-silence, maintaining
semi-secret contacts with Israeli leaders, just as his grandfather
had done.
</P>
<P>
   What he had, he would hold. The Plucky Little King would be a
friend of the West. When a Washington newspaper claimed that the
king had received millions from the CIA, the stories were
suppressed in Amman. &QL;

   If the middle brother Prince Mohamed seemed a little unstable in
his early years _ there was talk of mental illness _ he has settled

<P>
   Hassan, the youngest brother, married a Pakistani wife, and
devoted himself to Jordan's development before ambition took
control of his loyalty. A friend of the king once dangerously
compared him to Cecil Rhodes.

   Long regarded as a pliable ``friend'' of the west, King Hussein
astonished his American allies by embracing Saddam Hussein _ quite
literally _ after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did he really believe
Saddam would ``liberate'' Jerusalem? Or that Jordan could survive
without the Gulf Arabs?
</P>
<P>
   He grew a beard; in Amman, he was called ``Sheriff of Mecca.''
The Saudis were enraged. He appeared to be looking towards lost
lands. He knew the Palestinians would support Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   He became the most popular monarch in the Arab world at the very
moment he became the most unpopular monarch in the west.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, the Americans were ready to roll up the Hashemite
carpet. U.S. newspapers were predicting the end of his rule.
</P>
<P>
   But then _ stunned by Yasser Arafat's secret ``peace'' deal with
Israel and himself now politically and economically weakened (an
essential ingredient for any nation wishing to make peace with the
Israelis), the king made his own peace with Yitzhak Shamir and
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
   And overnight, the treacherous ally of the beastly Saddam became
again the Plucky Little King. &QL;

<P>
   His appointment of Crown Prince Abdullah as regent may safeguard
the Hashemite inheritance. But the pressures will grow greater in
the coming months and years.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans would like Abdullah to host the anti-Saddam Iraqi
opposition in Amman, and encourage him to make a military foray
into western Iraq to create a ``safe haven'' for Saddam's Iraqi
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And the Jordanians, as usual, have been given no role in the
succession. The Hashemites may claim their ancestry back to the
Prophet Muhamed _ as they do _ but they are Tudors rather than
democrats, an oligarchy rather than a modern monarchy, however
liberal and decent they are as individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is a tank commander, a proven general of Hussein's
Praetorian Guard. In Amman, they tell you not to be fooled by the
soft smile, that Abdullah is a tough guy. He needs to be if he is
going to inherit his father's formidable mantle. &QL;

OAKMONT READY TO SHINE FOR LPGA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE SHELBURNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The course is fit, the scoreboards are up, there's
no major rain _ or wind _ anticipated, and seven of this year's
top-10 money-winners are in the field.
</P>
<P>
   Oakmont Country Club is ready for the first Valley of the Stars
Championship (formerly Los Angeles Women's Championship), which is
next week at the hillside Glendale course.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golf course is raring to go,'' said Greg Frederick,
Oakmont's head pro and recently elected vice-president of the
Southern California PGA Board of Directors.
</P>
<P>
   Frederick is proud of his course, one defended fiercely by some
of the most-difficult greens in the area. He expects Oakmont to
represent itself as well as it did last year, when one of the best
fields on the LPGA Tour averaged 3.5 strokes over par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what it is,'' Frederick said, ``is really a U.S.
Open-type venue for the tour, and we're thankful to get the
opportunity to show off Oakmont.''
</P>
<P>
   Defending U.S. Open champion Se Ri Pak and three-time player of
the year Anika Sorenstam lead a field that also includes area
players Helen Alfredsson of Glendale and former Oakmont junior star
Emilee Klein.
</P>
<P>
   Liselotte Neumann, Dottie Pepper, Julie Inkster, Meg Mallon,
Kris Tschetter and 1998 Nabisco Dinah Shore champion Pat Hurst join
Sorenstam on the current top-10 list and also will be taking
another shot at Oakmont next week.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it appears the field will be able to dodge the
weather problems that have plagued the tournament through the
years, bringing hail and sleet in the '80s and gale-force winds
that knocked down more than 50 trees before the '97 event. Last
year, heavy rains washed out Saturday's play, leaving shallow lakes
spanning some of Oakmont's fairways and reducing the tournament to
36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   That weather also gave Oakmont a chance to showcase the skills
of course superintendent Dave Flaxbeard and his groundskeeping
crew, whose nightlong repair work left competitors with sensational
playing conditions for Sunday's closing round.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Eggeling said she can't wait to get back and not just
because she's defending champion. She likes the fact that Oakmont's
twisting, tree-lined fairways and fast, undulating greens force her
to plan her shots more carefully than at many of the LPGA stops.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love a tough course because I concentrate better,'' she
said. ``The way this golf course is laid out, when you step up to
the tee, you pretty much know where you have to hit it. On this
course, you really have to focus, and I like a course like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Skills challenge at Vista: Valencia eighth-grader Brandon
Christiansen, who placed fifth in last year's national Toyota Golf
Skills Challenge, will have the advantage of local knowledge in
this year's qualifying competition. And so will a lot of other
Santa Clarita Valley golfers.
</P>
<P>
   Vista Valencia, Christiansen's home course, will be one of two
Southern California sites in the national qualifying round that
will advance the six flight winners at each of 25 sites to the
national final.
</P>
<P>
   Vista Valencia will host the eight-event skills test April
23-25, followed by an April 30-May 2 qualifier at Fullerton GC.
Christiansen had the best overall score of more than 1,400
competitors last spring at Fullerton, earning a trip to the
national final at Ojai Inn and Spa, where he placed fifth in the
kids (age 8-13) division.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is also in junior (14-17), men's, women's, senior
men's (50-over) and open divisions. Competitors are awarded points
for skill in long-driving, short irons, trouble shots, middle
irons, chip shots, putting, greenside-bunker play and pitching over
a hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Entry fee at Vista Valencia is $20. The entry at Fullerton is
$25. Competition lasts about four hours and golfers can sign for
either or both events. Registration information: (800) 932-8337.
</P>
<P>
   Names in the game: Henry Liaw, Christiansen's talented age-group
rival who shot a course-record 58 at Alhambra GC last year, is
bidding to become one of the youngest participants ever in a PGA
Tour event. Liaw, 13, will play in a Buick Invitational qualifier
Monday at Eagle Crest in Escondido. The eighth grader at Alvarado
Middle School in Rowland Heights will be shooting against pros but
he might not be such a longshot. He followed his 58 at par-70
Alhambra with a 7-under-par 65 one week later at the Industry Hills
Babe Zaharius course, where the official record is 69 . . .
</P>
<P>
   Former Cal State Northridge golfer Gary Finneran recorded his
third hole-in-one last week, acing the par-3, 210-yard 17th hole at
Sunset Hills Country Club with a 4-iron. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Westlake senior J.T. Kohut could compete in as many as four PGA
Tour qualifiers before starting his final high school golf season
March 1. Kohut will try to qualify for next week's Buick
Invitational on Monday at El Camino Country Club in Oceanside and
has signed up for a Nissan Open qualifier next Friday at Los
Seranos and for a Tucson Open qualifier Feb. 22 at Arthur Park GC
in Tucson, Ariz. He shot even-par 72 while failing to qualify for
the Phoenix Open at Papago GC in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   Kohut, who has narrowed his college choices to USC and UCLA,
seems sharp for his PGA Tour qualifying run. Last week on his home
course at par-71 Sunset Hills, he double-bogeyed the first hole and
finished with a 64. &QL;

DUCKS WIN 3-0
</HEADLINE>

By GREG CHRISTENSEN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Matt Cullen finally made it to the top on Wednesday
night, and he took full advantage of his opportunity in the Mighty
Ducks' 3-0 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks before 15,254 at the
Pond.
</P>
<P>
   After a solid rookie season, Cullen has played on the second,
third and fourth lines this season. He had only 10 points in his
first 41 games. But Anaheim coach Craig Hartsburg, desperate to
snap his team's five-game winless streak (0-4-1), moved the young
center between Paul Kariya and Teemu Selanne.
</P>
<P>
   Cullen responded with a goal and an assist as the Ducks
(18-22-9) won for just the second time in nine games (2-6-1).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played very well tonight,'' said Hartsburg. ``I
thought he complimented them well, so we will play him there on
Friday in Tampa Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartsburg's said there is ``nothing written in stone'' about
Cullen's spot on the line, but a critical third-period power play
goal certainly didn't hurt his chances for more playing time with
the Ducks' two star wingers.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's performance wasn't especially memorable, but it was
good enough to beat the Western Conference's worst team.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the game went on I thought we got stronger and stronger,''
said Hartsburg, who is now 3-1 versus the team that fired him last
spring. ``Now we have to carry this on to the next game.''
</P>
<P>
   For two periods Chicago controlled much of the play, but it was
the Ducks who took an early lead on Kariya's 21st goal at 3:34 of
the first period. Cullen then put the Blackhawks away 24 seconds
into the third period with his fourth goal of the year while
Anaheim was on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Marty McInnis scored his 15th goal of the year into an empty net
with 11.1 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   One goal is all Guy Hebert would have needed, but he was
thrilled to see Cullen give the Ducks a 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many times we have let teams creep back in games,'' said
Hebert, who stopped 35 shots and recorded his career-high fifth
shutout of the season. ``That (goal) was huge, it made everybody
feel better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then we started playing better. Maybe we've finally learned
from some of our mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first period was played in Anaheim's defensive zone,
but the Ducks took a lead into the second thanks to a goal that had
to make Hartsburg especially happy.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty, but it was just the type of goal that the
coach has been looking for from his team. Cullen deflected Ruslan
Salei's point shot and Kariya was right in front of the net to pick
up the rebound and lift a backhander over Jocelyn Thibault's glove
just before he was knocked to the ice by Jamie Allison.
</P>
<P>
   Kariya has fallen nine points behind Pittsburgh's Jaromir Jagr
(72-63) in the scoring race, but he was a factor all night,
recording seven shots on goals while avoiding Chris Chelios
constant stickwork, including several two-handed slashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chelly plays hard against everybody, not just Paul Kariya,''
said Hartsburg. ``You may not like, but you have to accept it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Kariya was being hounded by Chelios, high-scoring Chicago
winger Tony Amonte was taking his licks from Anaheim's defensemen,
especially Jason Marshall and Kevin Haller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we did a good job on Tony, he didn't have much open
ice,'' said Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   While Chicago had the territorial advantage in the first period,
the Blackhawks really had only one good scoring chance and Hebert
got some help from the post on a shot by Todd White, who had blown
around Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago had 15 shots on goal in the second period and Hebert had
to be sharp early. He made a glove save on White in the opening
minute and thwarted Nelson Emerson and White -- again -- on
point-blank chances about five minutes into the period.
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks failed to score on a brief 27-second two-man advantage
just before the second period ended. But Anaheim's power play unit
scored the crucial goal early in the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Selanne got a pass to Cullen in the right circle. Cullen waited
for Chelios to slide by and with all kinds of time beat Thibault
with a shot high over the Chicago goalie's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim, the league's top-ranked power play at home, has scored
at least one power play goal in 23 of 26 games at the Pond.

 DAVIS CALLS MEXICO JOURNEY A `HOME RUN'  &HT;     By CARLA MARINUCCI 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  MONTERREY, Mexico _ California Gov. Gray Davis wrapped up
his three-day trip to Mexico Wednesday, calling the effort a ``home
run'' that produced tangible gains for California in business,
academic exchange and trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was overwhelmed by the reception in Mexico,'' said Davis, in
an interview as he jetted home Wednesday night from Monterrey,
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone understood the sincerity, my reaching out to
the people of Mexico. It exceeded my expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis closed out his Mexican trip less than 150 miles from the
border with Texas, a state that has slipped past California as
Mexico's primary trading partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor (George W.) Bush has done a very good job developing
a relationship with President (Ernesto) Zedillo,'' said Davis as he
arrived earlier in Monterrey, a business powerhouse and capital of
the Mexican state of Nuevo Leon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't begrudge any jobs Texas has won ... but I think we
have a strong case to make that business leaders throughout Mexico,
and in Monterrey, should look at California,'' Davis said. ``We
have a ways to go to catch up, but we're off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis refused to engage in what he called ``a rift on the
border'' with Bush, but he was clearly elated Wednesday by two
major developments. Davis disclosed that Zedillo will make his
first-ever official visit to California, and he celebrated a major
deal in which telecommunications giant Telmex will relocate its
U.S. headquarters from Houston to San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Davis recounted last night how he himself sealed that deal at
the home of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helu, the Telmex
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Slim had had informal talks for weeks about the
company's possible move to California. Davis said the reception at
Slim's home provided the setting he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times was I going to have dinner with Carlos Slim?
That was the moment,'' Davis said. ``And I learned a long time ago
to seize the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis spent the final day of his trip in Monterrey, a business
and financial magnet of 3 million people, meeting with Nuevo Leon
Governor Fernando Canales Clariond, who presides over the sprawling
state that borders Texas.
</P>
<P>
   With a state delegation of business and academic leaders at his
side, Davis saw clear evidence of the Mexican demand for foreign
products as they traveled highways lined with American-grown
businesses, from Wal-Mart and Sam's Club to Amway and Whirlpool.
</P>
<P>
   Davis announced that Canales, like Zedillo, had agreed to bring
a trade mission to California. He also said that the two governors
would work together with Delta and Aeromexico airlines to develop
direct air routes between Monterrey and California.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he expects Zedillo to be ``treated like a rock
star'' when he arrives to address the California Legislature in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Davis also traveled to the Instituto de Tecnologico de
Monterrey, a private university specializing in technology
education, where he held an international video conference on
academic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, pushing for more academic exchanges, said he wants to
double the number of exchange students, currently 200, between
Mexico and the California State University system.
</P>
<P>
   And in one of the more unusual aspects of his trip, Davis _ a
lifelong politician _ said he has picked up a political tip from
his Mexican counterpart that he is considering importing to
Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The tip came at a session at which Davis toured the Nuevo Leon
governor's palace, where 2,000 people had patiently lined up to
make direct, personal appeals to the governor's office. Their
once-a-month chance to get direct action for problems ranging from
legal troubles to neighborly disputes is part of a year-old program
that Canales calls ``Direct Line.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, he told Davis, more than 11,000 citizens have come to
have their complaints heard, and an astounding 96 percent of them
had their problems solved, Mexican government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis appeared enthralled as he sat with Canales and heard an
appeal from a small businessman, Reynaldo Gardia, who arrived
literally hat in hand to ask the Mexican governor for a loan
refinance.
</P>
<P>
   Canales, who meets each month with citizens and directs his
Cabinet to do likewise, ordered it done.

   The California governor said he was ``very impressed'' by
Mexican attempts to give citizens direct contact with their
political leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm inclined to adopt something similar in California,'' he
said. ``We don't spend enough time talking to individual citizens.
... It's a very wise thing to do.''

 THE KIDNAPPING THAT GRIPPED THE NATION  &HT;     By WILLIAM CARLSEN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ On a crisp, clear winter night 25 years ago
Thursday, three armed kidnappers burst into a Berkeley, Calif.,
apartment and carried off a 19-year-old newspaper heiress wrapped
in a blue bathrobe.
<P>
   Her name was Patricia Campbell Hearst, and her kidnapping _
complete with gunshots and squealing cars a few blocks south of the
University of California campus _ set off one of the most bizarre
sagas in modern history.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was over, the granddaughter of publishing magnate
William Randolph Hearst had joined her kidnappers _ a small band of
self-styled revolutionaries who called themselves the Symbionese
Liberation Army _ helping them rob banks and plant bombs before she
was eventually arrested in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Her trial, held in San Francisco's federal courthouse, was
billed as the ``trial of the century'' _ the first time since the
Lindbergh kidnapping trial in the 1930s that the term was used with
any seriousness. Eventually she served two years in federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 44-year-old Hearst hurries through the busy life of
an East Coast society matron, devoted to a raft of charities,
raising two teenage daughters, appearing in the occasional John
Waters movie. It is a life so normal that her kidnapping now seems
like a mirage, an event so implausible and so long ago that it is
as if it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   It was a different era, but one that bears at least one uncanny
similarity to the present. On the day of the kidnapping, the nation
was preoccupied with talk of the impeachment of the president, and
special prosecutor Leon Jaworsky was demanding that Richard Nixon
turn over the fateful White House tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Lines at gas stations extended for blocks, as the Arab oil
embargo squeezed supplies. On the Sunday before the kidnapping,
only 11 stations in San Francisco had enough gasoline to open.
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnam War was nearly over and, despite Watergate, the
nation at times seemed to be trying to reclaim some of its earlier
innocence. ``American Graffiti'' had debuted in movie theaters the
previous year, and ``Happy Days'' was playing on television.
</P>
<P>
   But the act of terror that struck a quiet Berkeley neighborhood
on the night of Feb. 4, 1974, reminded the nation that the radical
political turmoil that had begun in the 1960s was still in full
force, at least in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   In its first ``communiques'' after the kidnapping, the SLA
railed against the establishment, demanding that the wealthy Hearst
family _ her father was chairman of the Hearst Corp. and editor of
the San Francisco Examiner _ use its millions to feed the poor.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Patty Hearst would be heard in tape recordings denouncing
her parents as ``pigs,'' a phrase that sent shudders through
mothers and fathers across America.
</P>
<P>
   And on April 15, a little more than two months after her
kidnapping, Hearst, now calling herself ``Tanya,'' appeared in the
jerky frames of a surveillance video, holding a rifle as she and
her kidnappers robbed the Hibernia Bank in San Francisco's Sunset
District.
</P>
<P>
   When she was arrested 17 months later, after one of the most
intensive manhunts in FBI history, she gave the revolutionary
clenched-fist salute. Asked her occupation when was being booked
and fingerprinted, she replied: ``urban guerrilla.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with F. Lee Bailey, his famous law partner, J. Albert
Johnson was hired by the Hearsts to defend their daughter against
the Hibernia bank robbery charges.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he spent hours every day with Hearst at the jail,
while Bailey held press conferences and attended to pretrial work
on the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just allowed her to express her feelings, to come out of
it,'' Johnson said late in January. ``It was never planned as a
deprogramming, never. She just slowly freed herself from the
brainwashing.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time her trial began four months later, Hearst's
transformation back to being a frightened Berkeley sophomore was
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst testified that after her kidnapping, the SLA kept her
blindfolded for more than 50 days in a closet in a Daly City,
Calif., safe house, incessantly haranguing her with radical
rhetoric. She also explained that she took part in the Hibernia
Bank robbery out of fear that she would be killed if she did not.
</P>
<P>
   But the man who prosecuted her, former U.S. Attorney James L.
Browning, has never wavered in his belief that Hearst was guilty
and her trial and its outcome just.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her defense was physical duress, but it never squared with the
facts,'' said Browning, 66, who recently retired from the San Mateo
County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was in that bank,'' Browning said, ``she acted with
verve and great purpose, and she avoided apprehension for a year
and a half, when she had plenty of opportunities to walk away and
come home. The fact is she had joined them.''
</P>
<P>
   It took the jury little more than a day to convict her,
concluding that she had been a willing participant in the Hibernia
Bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, after serving two years of a five-year sentence,
President Jimmy Carter commuted her sentence and she was freed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patty was a victim of her times,'' said Johnson. ``She was a
victim of a cruel kidnapping. She was a victim of the American
people, who despised her because she represented the radical nature
of young people at the time. She was the victim of the rich, who
thought of her as impudent and disrespectful, and a victim of the
left and the poor who saw her as a spoiled little rich girl.
</P>
<P>
   `'But most of all she was a victim of the system that prosecuted
her,'' said the 65-year-old Boston lawyer. ``In all my life, I've
never seen such an injustice as her conviction.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Harris broke into the apartment 25 years ago, dragged the
screaming Hearst down a flight of stairs and threw her into the
trunk of a stolen white Chevrolet. He was accompanied during the
kidnapping by Donald DeFreeze, also known as General Field Marshal
Cinque, and Angela Atwood, while other SLA members waited in nearby
cars.
</P>
<P>
   DeFreeze, Atwood and four other SLA members died in a shootout
with police in Los Angeles three months later.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Harris works as a private investigator for defense
lawyers in the Bay Area. He and his wife, Emily, were arrested with
Hearst in San Francisco in 1975, and they were convicted of her
kidnapping. They served eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just lucky to be alive,'' said the 54-year-old Harris in a
recent interview. ``I should be dead or in prison, and I'm amazed I
survived.''
</P>
<P>
   Divorced from Emily, Harris said he is now happily married to a
local defense attorney and they have two children. He said he is
still committed to the underdog, working every day as a defense
investigator to represent ``people at the bottom of the pile.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there. I had another chance. I feel empathy and
compassion for people, even if they've done heinous things.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Hearst, he said he is already on record as disputing many
of the details she wrote about in ``Every Secret Thing,'' her 1982
book about the kidnapping and her time in the SLA.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published in the Oakland Tribune in 1988, Harris
claimed that Hearst was already rebelling against her parents
before her kidnapping and had second thoughts about her engagement
to live-in boyfriend Steven Weed. He said she willingly joined the
SLA and called her enthusiastic, highly intelligent and
strong-willed. He had opposed letting her join.
</P>
<P>
   But even now, Harris said, he is still a bit bewildered by her.
``She was a very interesting person, and not everybody would have
responded (to her kidnapping) like she did. Now she's turning out
like her mother (the late, staunchly conservative UC Regent
Catherine Hearst).''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   While she enjoys many of the trappings of her family wealth and
has become a fixture at East Coast celebrity and charity functions,
she has never lost a certain quirkiness and sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   She co-authored a novel titled ``Murder at San Simeon'' and has
appeared in minor roles in several campy John Waters movies,
including the 1990 film ``Cry Baby,'' where her role was a parody
of a prim, suburban housewife.
</P>
<P>
   In Waters' most recent film, called ``Pecker,'' Hearst plays an
obnoxious New York art collector who shows off her cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell people,'' she said to one interviewer about her entree
into acting, ``If you want to be in films, wait tables _ don't get
kidnapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Her most outrageous moment came in 1995 at a Thierry Mugler
fashion show in Paris, when she strode down the runway in giant
shoes and performed a striptease.
</P>
<P>
   She declined to be interviewed for this story. Her husband,
Bernard Shaw, a San Francisco cop who first met Hearst when he was
moonlighting as her bodyguard, is now head of security for the
Hearst Corp. in New York. He said his wife sees the 25th
anniversary of her kidnapping as ``just another day going by'' and
would rather not dwell on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really busy,'' Shaw said, counting off a list of
charities Hearst is involved in. No other books or movies are
currently in the works. ``She's waiting to see what might come
along.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier interviews, Hearst often laughed at the fact that her
parents never thought her marriage to Shaw would last more than a
few months. ``They gave us a Sears vacuum cleaner for a wedding
present,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Shaw pointed out that in April, they will have been married for
20 years. ``We're doing really well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the four-unit building near the corner of Benvenue Avenue and
Parker Street in Berkeley, a woman behind the sliding frosted-glass
door cautiously asks who is there, just as Hearst's fiance, Steven
Weed, did about 9 p.m. on that February night a quarter of a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The brown-shingle building looks much as it did then. The
shingles are a little faded; the eucalyptus tree is still out
front. Two cars are parked in the wide cement driveway where 25
years ago the white Chevrolet was waiting with its motor running
for the three kidnappers and their victim.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who does not identify herself, says she is not the
owner of the two-story, two-bedroom unit that was converted into a
condo 11 years ago, and she does not feel right about letting
anyone in to see the historic location.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we know about its history,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Then she pointed to a hole in a wood shingle to the right of the
door and one in the aluminum door frame, where the kidnappers fired
off rounds to scare away neighbors who had appeared that night to
see what was causing all the shouting and screaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still come around occasionally asking about the place,
out of curiosity, but fewer and fewer of them these days.''
</P>

 MONTEREY PENINSULA ENGAGED IN GOLF COURSE WARS  &HT;     By MICHAEL MCCABE 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Monterey County _ There's a war over golf being
waged here, but it has little to do with who can stay out of the
bunkers during the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro Am golf
tournament, which starts Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pebble Beach Co., which owns nearly half of the gloriously
beautiful 5,300 acres that many consider one of golf's holiest
shrines, has big plans to build another golf course _ the area's
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   It also wants to develop 316 lots for luxury housing _ plus 53
more housing  &LR; units for affordable housing _ and build a new
41,000-square-foot clubhouse, complete with restaurants, banquet
rooms and shops.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, the company will need to remove as many as 33,222
Monterey pine trees. It will also have to tear down an equestrian
center and polo field to accommodate the Tom Fazio-designed golf
course, to be located between the Cypress Point and Pebble Beach
courses.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the Pebble Beach Co. has agreed to build a brand-new
``state-of-the-art'' equestrian center costing as much as $5
million in a new 41-acre location near Highway 68.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Monterey County environmentalists _ and many
Pebble Beach residents _ are aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this plan goes through, the Del Monte forest will be
totally gone,'' said Janice O'Brien, a member of the Concerned
Residents of Pebble Beach. ``The whole mood and look of the place
will be radically changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach Co. officials insist they have the right, and a
burning need, to develop property they have owned for years and for
which they have paid taxes and maintenance costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our golf courses _ including Spyglass, Spanish Bay and Pebble
Beach _ are virtually sold out year-round,'' said Rich Patterson,
Pebble Beach Co.'s director of community affairs. ``This will ease
demand on all the golf courses at Pebble Beach and will allow us to
continue in the kind of business we have been in for 80 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach is a private enclave accessible only through toll
gates, where nonresidents pay $7.25 for the privilege of touring
the 17-Mile Drive, the Del Monte Forest, the baronial mansions
along the shoreline, the world-class golf courses and the
ultra-posh resort now known simply as the Lodge. It costs $325 to
play a round of golf at Pebble Beach Co.'s golf courses, among the
most expensive in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The project has undergone several revisions in recent years. It
has been reviewed by the county planning staff, which is in general
recommending approval. The project is expected to go before the
county Planning Commission in April and to the county Board of
Supervisors for approval in the summer, according to Jeff Main,
Monterey County senior planner. If county approvals are granted,
then the plan will go to the California Coastal Commission.
</P>
<P>
   What development might do to the cherished stands of Monterey
pine and other plant species that depend on its habitat is what
divides residents of Monterey County. Indeed, many residents of the
Monterey peninsula, which includes Pebble Beach, are so frustrated
by the amount of development taking place that there is a nascent
campaign to form a new county.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly worrisome to many is the fate of the Monterey
pines, many of which are dying. A virulent and incurable fungus
known as the pitch canker is sweeping through the last stands here,
killing healthy trees and threatening to turn the verdant hills
brown.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of years ago, Monterey pine blanketed the coast. But
drier weather, rising temperatures and human encroachment have cut
its range to just three native stands: on the Monterey Peninsula,
in Ano Nuevo State Reserve along the San Mateo County coast and in
Cambria north of San Luis Obispo.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the infection, the native stands are considered the best
hope for combating pitch canker. Plant geneticists estimate that up
to 15 percent of Monterey pines are resistant to the fungus and
could be used to regrow devastated stands. The Pebble Beach company
plans to `'mitigate'' the removal of the trees by replacing them
with new trees, possibly by working with nurseries to find trees
that have survived the disease and then cloning them.
</P>
<P>
   But Mary Ann Matthews of the local chapter of the California
Native Plant Society said the approach will not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The existing Monterey pine at Pebble Beach are natives, and
they have the greatest genetic diversity and hold the greatest
promise in finding resistant strains,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Nielsen, a member of Concerned Residents of Pebble Beach,
is also worried about traffic, water and the loss of the beloved
equestrian center, which many believe is so historically valuable
that it is an irreplaceable treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell, we don't want the golf course,'' Nielsen
said.``We believe the equestrian center and the polo field are
community property, and that the company has no right to simply
destroy it and put a golf course there.''
</P>
<P>
   John Tormey, who formed a group called Alliance for a Balanced
Community that backs the company's plans, says that although
opponents of the Pebble Beach Co. have used ``sniper fire'' so far,
the war could escalate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each side has a nuclear weapon. The environmentalists can
force a referendum if the county board approves this project _
which most of us expect will happen, on both counts,'' Tormey said.
``And if the referendum wins, which it probably would, the Pebble
Beach Company can argue they cannot be denied because it violates
their Fifth Amendment right not to have their private property
taken away for public use without just compensation. And here I
think we are talking about $150 million.''

`DEATH VALLEY' A GOOD, HOT READ
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Death Valley and Yosemite national parks are
unique not only for their scenery but for their history, yet
information of the past beyond roadway plaques can be as
inaccessible as the historic sites themselves.
</P>
<P>
   No more. ``Death Valley to Yosemite: Frontier Mining Camps &AMP;
Ghost Towns'' by L. Burr Belden and Mary DeDecker (Spotted Dog
Press; $14.95) fills in the details about lesser-known aspects of
these two regions' colorful past. As a bonus, it also includes
information on hikes in ghost towns.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, old-timers from those parts, have collected the
tales and presented them as the truth. They may well be authentic,
but even if only legends they're great stories about the miners,
soldiers, outlaws and oddballs drawn to the West by the land, the
minerals and the seeming promise of quick, easy wealth.
</P>
<P>
   There's a band of robbers that hides out in a canyon after
holding up a stagecoach, only to find the ravine holds a rich vein
of gold. One of the bandits knows a senator, and they arrange to
give the stolen money back and to make claims. The senator, of
course, has a stake in the mine _ in Panamint, one of the many boom
towns in Death Valley. Later owners of the mine got wise to a
planned robbery of their silver, so they thwarted the would-be
perpetrators by casting the metal in 700-pound cannonballs.
</P>
<P>
   Other discoverers of gold and silver included a soldier, a boy
shepherd and lost travelers. One man reputedly found a rich
outcropping of gold right underneath a spot where his burro had
wandered off in search of grass.
</P>
<P>
   The boomtowns were tough places. Of the first 31 buildings built
in Monoville, 23 were liquor stores, while Rhyolite, Nev., bragged
of having 53 saloons and two churches. In Skidoo, a Death Valley
outpost, a man who killed a banker was lynched from a telephone
pole in the sheriff's absence; already dead, he was hanged a second
time to show off frontier customs for a visiting Los Angeles
journalist.
</P>
<P>
   The 192-page book _ which includes archival photos and prints,
along with easy-to-read maps to long-forgotten sites that might
otherwise go unnoticed _ is published by a tiny Bishop company
rapidly becoming a valuable commodity in Eastern Sierra history.
``Death Valley to Yosemite'' would liven up a vacation, a day hike
or a backpacking trip in the two areas, despite some rather
disruptive editing flaws and questionable oversights.Our rating:
(zap)HHH &UR; !off! &LR;
</P>
<P>
   How can a book about the Sierra Nevada mountain range possibly
rise above the myriad others in print?
</P>
<P>
   Simple: The author can go off the beaten path and take the route
rarely traveled. He can explore lesser-known trails and stress the
personal, spiritual aspects of the wilderness experience.
</P>
<P>
   Presto. Phil Arnot's ``High Sierra: John Muir's Range of Light''
(Wide World Publishing/Tetra; $12.95) provides a panorama of
odysseys the hiker can enjoy, in a range of locations that span the
chain. Moonlit treks. Mountaintop layovers. Spring runoff. Autumn
colors. Lunar rainbows. Splendid waterfalls. Solo hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Arnot, an environmentalist, mountaineer and explorer, knows the
Sierra as if it is spiritual home. The breadth of his knowledge is
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The advice of the native Californian is useful and the black and
white pictures in the 372-page book are generally excellent. Maps
would have completed the package but are noticeably absent. At
least Arnot describes clearly how to reach trailheads.
</P>
<P>
   I have firsthand knowledge of one of the hikes listed, a climb
of Mount Dana, and he provides a competent narration. I only wish I
had taken his advice and followed a comfortable pace to the top
rather than racing; as he wrote, if you're out of breath all the
time, you're going too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Arnot shows not how to conquer the Sierra but how to enjoy them.
Our rating: HHH
</P>
<P>
   Wayne F. Moss' ``The Trinity Alps Companion'' (Ecopress; $14.95)
is an adequate guide that relies on four decades of personal
experiences to shuttle the reader along.
</P>
<P>
   Describing his boyhood home in Northwestern California, he lists
a wide range of day hikes, backpacking trips and fishing
opportunities. Maps and photos complement the profiles.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the 254-page book is memorable for all the wrong reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The author describes his youthful hikes and proves his knowledge
of the area, but the writing is far from riveting. Moreover, the
book is structured way too much on Moss' own past, as if it were an
expanded journal, and a particularly weepy one. In the end, it's a
terrible disservice to the newcomer looking for a good hike in the
Trinity Alps.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one of the author's endless meanderings, which all too
often are reduced to meaningless drivel:
</P>
<P>
   ``I find satisfaction enough in lying down on the sun-warmed
rocks and becoming a speck on a grain of sand on the shoreline of
the cosmic ocean, a microscopic flash in geologic eons. Looking
over Granite Creek Canyon, my eyes can soar like a hawk. Let others
catalogue and classify the world.''

CLINTON REQUESTS FUNDS FOR S.M. MOUNTAINS

By BRETT PAULY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The health of the Santa Monica Mountains National
Recreation Area got a major booster shot Monday, when President
Clinton requested $5 million to acquire private property for new
parkland in the chain.
</P>
<P>
   In earmarking the largest amount he has ever requested in an
annual federal budget for land acquisition in the Santa Monica
Mountains, Clinton listed it as the budget's fifth most important
land-acquisition objective, said U.S. Congressman Brad Sherman
(D-Woodland Hills).
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I knew we would not obtain funding equivalent to
Yellowstone or the Everglades,'' Sherman said in announcing the
news Friday, ``and I am quite gratified to be fifth in the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget now goes to the House of Representative and the
Senate for revisions, Sherman said, and it is uncertain how much of
Clinton's request will be realized in the end.

   MALIBU _ The best aspect of the newest segment of the Backbone
Trail _ apart from connecting another link in the chain across the
world's largest urban park _ is its simplicity.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who can hike, bike or ride a horse can tackle the
out-and-back five-mile round-trip through the west-central Santa
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every section of the Backbone Trail is a little different,''
said Joe Greenbaum of Reseda, hiking the mild roller coaster of a
pathway for the first time. ``This is a beautiful, easy walk that I
could bring my wife on if I wanted. Not challenging, just a nice up
and down. Not too long, but with pretty views.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is a beautiful day for hiking.''
</P>
<P>
   If you call overcast with no hint of sun beautiful, then, by all
means, it was. There is something special when low-flying clouds
cover the Santa Monicas. Sounds are muffled, especially traffic.
Faraway views are limited, especially buildings that scrape the
skies.
</P>
<P>
   A little foul weather goes a long way in forgetting the
metropolis, even when the trip is a short way.
</P>
<P>
   Open to visitors since mid-December, the Zuma Canyon trail
meanders across 2{ miles of chaparral, oak woodland and quiet
riparian flora from Kanan-Dume Road at its eastern trailhead to
Zuma Ridge Motorway fire road at the western terminus.
</P>
<P>
   The route gains just 100 feet of elevation overall, and less
than 350 feet from the lowest to highest points _ not much of a
challenge over that kind of length, believe me.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the trail is in immaculate shape, having received
months of manicuring from work crews repairing damage from the El
Nino-fueled winter storms of 1998 that had all but negated earlier
efforts in the canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrific _ smooth, wide-open, fast, tons of fun,'' said
mountain biker Brett Ross of Agoura Hills, who remembers a time
years ago when the best access to the upper stretches of Zuma
Canyon was via a tiny deerlike trail scratched into the bedrock.
``They did an unbelievable job compacting the hill properly. It's
well-groomed. There's not a bunch of rocks. You can cut loose on
straightaways; it could be a great mountain bike race course.'
</P>
<P>
   Ross maintains control and yields to hikers and equestrian, of
course, for it is just this type of trail that should attract
newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   And the time couldn't be more ideal to introduce the uninitiated
to one of the area's most accessible outdoors venues; it will be an
interesting study in five years to see how the trail holds up to
winter's wrath, for it isn't every day that a hiking trail is
inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1,625-foot trailhead, the track switchbacks once before
crossing Newton Creek (1,450 feet) and the spillway to understated
Newton Falls. It then jogs uphill to the northwest a short distance
mirroring Kanan-Dume Road and revealing the only vantage of the
Pacific Ocean and its numerous freight ships as it breaks away from
the blacktop above.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps a half-mile from Newton Creek, after losing some
elevation, the trail crosses Zuma Canyon Creek (1,400 feet) over a
formidable footbridge. It's nothing as romantic as those in Madison
County, mind you, but finding a nice ford of wooden planks
inevitably gives me pause for thought.
</P>
<P>
   Pocket your daydreams and climb through an oak thicket; some of
its trees bear the scars of fires past.
</P>
<P>
   The trail widens as it opens to sage and chamise, revealing the
odd sandstone outcroppings that help to define the mountain chain.
On the shady sides of some of the crumbly walls you will spy the
unusual live-forever _ a hardy succulent herb that can be
identified by the dead, ashen leaves at its base.
</P>
<P>
   Farther on, you will hear a waterfall that you cannot see. In
winters when the water table is higher, its cascades are visible
from the trail. A nearby rock looking down on passers-by provided a
more than adequate spot for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   The roller coaster continues for another mile or so to the north
end of Zuma Ridge Motorway (1,725 feet) overlooking Encinal Canyon
Road.
</P>
<P>
   Some visitors, content to stick with the trail that was laid
down in the past, question the strategy of building a new route
through Zuma Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes away the mystique,'' said Kevin Landis of Reseda.
``It used to be a lot of fun; it was very secluded. Once you got
past the first waterfall, it actually was a lot of work, so that
would tend to keep a lot of people out.''
</P>
<P>
   For good or ill, the secret that was Zuma Canyon is out. &QL; 
TALE OF THE TRAIL
</P>
<P>
   A glimpse of what went into constructing the 2.5-mile Zuma
Canyon section of the Backbone Trail:
</P>
<P>
   Start: May 1997
</P>
<P>
   Finish: October 1998 (first 10 months of work were lost to
damage from El Nino storms of February 1998)
</P>
<P>
   Official opening: Dec. 15
</P>
<P>
   Ribbon cutting: Jan. 14
</P>
<P>
   Paid work hours: 4,300
</P>
<P>
   Employees: National Park Service, California Conservation Corps,
Los Angeles Conservation Corps.
</P>
<P>
   Cost: $64,800 for labor and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Biggest equipment expense: $15,000 for footbridge over Zuma
Canyon Creek. Dimensions: 45 feet in span, 5 feet in width, 42-inch
railings. Materials: fiberglass structure, wood abutments, wood
planking. Height above creek: 15 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Funding: $40,000 grant from American Airlines, $14,000 grant
from National Park Service's Public Land Corps Program, balance
from Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area
base-operations funds.
</P>
<P>
   Average cost per mile of National Park Service trail: $70,000
</P>
<P>
   Cost per mile of Zuma Canyon segment: $25,920
</P>
<P>
   Reasons for savings: Countless volunteer hours provided
primarily by Concerned Off-Road Bicyclists Association, Santa
Monica Mountains Trails Council and the 120 people who participated
in National Trails Day in June 1997; Los Angeles County work hours
donated by a female probation facility.
</P>
<P>
   Trail width: 5 feet
</P>
<P>
   Safety first: No injuries occurred, however, despite cautions,
some laborers were clamoring for the calamine lotion after
encountering a half-mile section of oak woodland covered with
poison oak.
</P>
<P>
   Most shocking experience: ``Going out the third week of February
1998, after we had two weeks of just extreme rain, and seeing the
damage to the trail,'' said Woody Smeck, chief of maintenance for
the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. ``It was
eye-opening; we stood there in awe of what Mother Nature can
deliver.'' &QL;

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
IF YOU''RE GOING &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
To reach trailhead for the the Zuma Canyon segment of the Backbone
Trail, take the Ventura Freeway (101) north, exit at Kanan Road and
turn left. Proceed 8 miles, past Mulholland Highway and Latigo
Canyon Road, to the parking lot at the right and in front of the
third tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   While the trail is not yet found on maps, for reference use the
Point Dume 7.5-minute series topographic map or Tom Harrison
Cartography's ``Trail Map of the Santa Monica Mountains Central.''
</P>
<P>
   Allow three hours to complete the 5-mile round-trip.
</P>
<P>
   Motor vehicles, camping and fires are not permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Information: Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area,
(805) 370-2301.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If you can't commit to the whole trail, consider walking
to the end of the second switchback, at the crossing of Newton
Creek, and check out the top of Newton Falls, which will be flowing
better as more winter rains drop. The footing can be slippery here,
so watch your step. You can also bushwhack to the fall's outflow to
catch the view _ and mist _ from below.
</P>
<P>
   A longer option is to continue on the Backbone Trail another
half-mile or so to the quaint footbridge that crosses Zuma Canyon
Creek.

 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 
 BY ELIZABETH RAZZI
 FROM KIPLINGER'S MAGAZINE 
 &HT;    Sending your beloved a dozen long-stemmed red roses that you
order over the Internet may not be as romantic as going to the
florist yourself and picking out the reddest, freshest flowers in
the shop _ and then delivering them in person _ but life is full of
compromises. Still, that should not mean you have to compromise on
the quality of the roses your sweetheart finds on the doorstep this
Valentine's Day _ or any other special day.
 &HT;    On-line purchases accounted for a mere 0.2 percent of last
Valentine's Day's bouquets, according to a study by the American
Floral Endowment, a nonprofit research group. But Internet flower
sales are likely to grow as electronic commerce takes off in the
months and years ahead.
 &HT;    To see whether the Internet could deliver stunning rather than
just so-so flowers, I placed orders with four heavily advertised
on-line florists for a dozen red roses to be delivered boxed to
willing recipients in Washington, D.C., and its Maryland and
Virginia suburbs.
 &HT;    Service and quality varied a lot _ for example, half the roses
didn't arrive on time. Prices, including shipping, ranged from
$35.90 to $63.98. But that may be a bargain on Valentine's Day,
when prices at the local florist can spike to nearly $100 a dozen
in pricier cities. Even street-corner vendors can spot desperation
a block away and jack up their flower prices accordingly.
 &HT;    Some on-line florists, such as Flowerstop.com, say they expect
to hold the line on prices for Valentine's Day, but they offer no
guarantees. Lower-priced competitors, such as Proflowers.com,
expect the price of a dozen roses to go up to $40 or $50 (plus
shipping) in mid-February. Freshflowersource.com, which ships
directly from the grower, is aiming to keep its Valentine's Day
price within about $5 of its regular price of $29.95.
 &HT;    Ordering from any of the Web sites is hassle-free with a credit
card, but make sure you have the recipient's phone number _ it's
necessary for Federal Express delivery. Every site except
Freshflowersource.com advertises an unconditional guarantee. If
you're not satisfied with the quality of the flowers, they promise
to send a new bouquet or refund your money.
 THE ELUSIVE PERFECT BOUQUET 
 &HT;    Unfortunately, well before the romantic holiday we struck out on
getting what we really wanted: the classic presentation of a dozen
delicate blossoms nestled in lush, green foliage, tied with a
ribbon and laid in a crisp, white florist's box. Roses gathered
with a twist-tie and nestled in a FedEx box just don't have the
same charm.
 &HT;    Not one recipient complained _ even if I did ask all of them to
relinquish their flowers to our panel of judges. For fun I threw in
a dozen I picked up at a corner flower stand. You guessed it: The
$7 bouquet of street-corner roses was the first pick of some of the
judges.
 &HT;    Other than the street flowers, the roses from
 Freshflowersource.com  came closest to the best mix of price and
presentation. It charged $30.99 plus $11.99 for FedEx delivery
(FedEx is used by all the direct shippers), for a total of $42.98.
 &HT;    The roses, shipped from the grower in Southern California,
arrived on time. The note from the sender was handwritten on a
traditional florist's card. The roses had the longest stems (22
inches), each one ensconced in its own water tube. The greenery,
though, had no water and arrived dried-out and bedraggled.
 &HT;    Still, some judges were so impressed with the height of the
bouquet and deep red of the blooms that they were willing to
overlook the many small blemishes.
 WILTED BEFORE THEIR TIME  
 &HT;    Several judges liked the roses from
 1-800-Flowers.com  best. They cost $49.99 plus $6.99 handling, for
a total of $56.98 _ the second-priciest. The flowers came from a
local florist. The bouquet had the nicest greenery by far,
including several varieties of ferns. The stems were nice and long,
too, about 21 inches. And the sender's message was handwritten on a
traditional florist's card.
 &HT;    Unfortunately, the roses were delivered a day earlier than
requested _ and they arrived in a glass vase, not boxed, as
ordered. (We weren't charged the extra $10 for the vase.) And the
flowers started to wilt by the end of the second day we had them.
 DELAYED GRATIFICATION 
 &HT;     Proflowers.com,  a company that does 90 percent of its business
over the Internet, had the cheapest price, $29.95 plus only $5.95
for FedEx shipping. Maybe it needs to charge more for shipping _
the flowers came a day late.
 &HT;    The flowers, shipped directly from growers in California,
included baby's breath but no ferns or other foliage. The bouquet
was tied with a blue fabric rose. The 18-inch stems came in
individual water tubes, and the bouquet was packed in straw and
with a cold pack. The message was laser-printed on a piece of
floral computer paper. Three of the blossoms arrived as tightly
closed buds (the Web site said several would be shipped as buds),
but they did eventually open.
 HIGHEST PRICE PER INCH  
 &HT;     Flowerstop.com  _ operated by a retail florist shop in Colorado
Springs, Colo., that ships trademarked ``Long Distance Roses''
grown by the proprietor's brother _ charged the most: $54.99 plus
$8.99 FedEx, for a grand total of $63.98. Despite the high price,
its flowers were the shortest (about 17 inches) and had the palest
greenery. The bouquet included baby's breath _ and one measly fern.
Several people singled it out as the bunch bought off the street
corner.
 &HT;    The flower stems were pushed into a moist foam cube and the box
included two reusable cold packs. But the message from the sender
was printed on the inside of a flier with the florist's logo and
``800'' number _ hardly the stuff of romance.
 -0- 
 SIDEBAR: RATING THE ROSES  
 &HT;    Flowerstop.com: Most expensive ... and most frequently mistaken
for the cheap street-vendor flowers.
 &HT;    Freshflowersource.com: Very long stems with deep, red blossoms.
As romantic as you can hope for from a FedEx box.
 &HT;    1-800-Flowers.com: Nicest arrangement _ but bad timing, and the
flowers started to wilt by the second day.
 &HT;    Proflowers.com: Fresh blossoms at the cheapest price. But they
arrived a day late. Get your excuses ready!
 -0- 
 SIDEBAR: GETTING THEM THERE IN TIME  
 &HT;    Valentine's Day falls on a Sunday this year, making the timing
of on-line orders more problematic than usual. Unless a Web site
contracts with local florists (as 1-800-Flowers.com often does), it
uses Federal Express to ship the flowers. On-line florists are
trying to line up options for special Sunday deliveries, but you
can expect to pay $10 or so extra _ if the service is available.
With FedEx deliveries, Saturdays usually cost more, too (up to
$10), and Monday deliveries aren't always available.
 &HT;    Place your order early _ the Monday or Tuesday before
Valentine's Day _ for the best crack at the rose color of your
choice. In fact, sites are likely to quit taking orders guaranteed
for holiday delivery several days ahead of the big day.
 &HT;    Some florists expect demand for roses to be a bit lower this
year because Valentine's Day falls on a weekend, when couples are
more likely to celebrate with a night on the town rather than roses
delivered to the office.

trying to line up options for special Sunday deliveries, but you
can expect to pay $10 or so extra _ if the service is available.
With FedEx deliveries, Saturdays usually cost more, too (up to
$10), and Monday deliveries aren't always available.
 &HT;    Place your order early _ the Monday or Tuesday before
Valentine's Day _ for the best crack at the rose color of your
choice. In fact, sites are likely to quit taking orders guaranteed
for holiday delivery several days ahead of the big day.
 &HT;    Some florists expect demand for roses to be a bit lower this
year because Valentine's Day falls on a weekend, when couples are
more likely to celebrate with a night on the town rather than roses
delivered to the office.

   DAVOS, Switzerland _ My hotel bill here was denominated in both
Swiss francs and euros, a currency that won't exist in notes and
coins until 2002, but one that has nevertheless already altered the
fiscal map of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Europeans have set up a system of fixed exchange rates among
11 nations that still differ greatly in such matters as pay scales,
social welfare benefits and the demand for goods and services. But
investors and borrowers seem to like the euro, which they see as
more than the sum of its parts.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers confide that the euro's smart liftoff came because
long-term interest rates in the euro zone are now a full percentage
point lower than U.S. Treasury bonds. Investors are content to
accept the lower euro yields because they think European bond
prices will rise in the next few months, thus providing them with a
capital gains windfall.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, Switzerland, Britain and other strong players who
remain out of the euro game are bound to join in. There was even
some talk here at the World Economic Forum that Russia should adopt
the euro to ease its grave economic and social plight.
</P>
<P>
   Gold and currency reserves held by the 11 partners in the
European monetary union exceed those of the United States and Japan
combined. ``Size is critical,'' says C. Fred Bergsten, director of
the Institute for International Economics, a Washington-based
research group.
</P>
<P>
   Bergsten told the forum that Europe and America should cut a
deal that would keep the dollar and the euro in sync with each
other, within a loosely defined trading band.
</P>
<P>
   But Willem Duisenberg, head of the European Central Bank, told
the gathering that price stability counts for more protecting the
dollar against a surging euro. Duisenberg said he favors a
``tripolar system,'' based on the dollar, the euro and yen, once
the Japanese recover their fiscal footing.
</P>
<P>
   Although Tokyo markets remain weak, Masayuki Matsushima, who
heads the Bank of Japan, called the introduction of the euro on
Jan. 1 ``a great political event'' that has already had a major
impact on Asian ideas about future economic links.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Asians have a ways to go. Over a dinner with
journalists, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir bin Mohamad boasted
that his currency, the ringgit, no longer can re-enter Malaysia and
was worthless when taken abroad. ``We have driven the currency
speculators from the scene,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The logic behind these patterns calls for a single planetary
unit of value, a system that would end currency speculation and
ensure fiscal stability once and for all. Based on Duisenberg's
tripolar concept, the dollar-euro-yen, or the dey, would restore
the way things were during Roman Empire, when a single gold-based
currency was used by people everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   It's an idea that would get you laughed out of the Davos
meeting. But perhaps in a generation or so, hotels here will bill
in deys.

   Like many other researchers, Michael Zasloff made his discovery
as a fortuitous accident while doing unrelated studies. He was
doing genetic research on frogs when he noticed that after he
operated on them in a nonsterile environment, the wounds never
became infected. Hypothesizing that something in their skin was
protecting them from bacterial attack, he discovered a peptide,
which he named magainin. He proceeded to find peptide antibiotics
in a host of other animals. Zasloff is turning these peptides into
antibiotic drugs for humans in the hope of providing an alternative
or an adjunct to existing drugs. Clinical trials are now taking
place. Josie Glausiusz is an associate editor at Discover magazine.

   El Nino helped make 1998 the hottest year ever recorded. Its
dramatic weather changes have been linked to an upsurge of diseases
such as cholera, malaria and dengue fever around the globe, as well
as a brutal drought in Texas, wildfires in Indonesia and Brazil,
marine mammal deaths in the western Pacific and a host of other
woes. Scientists are hard at work trying to improve their ability
to predict El Ninos so we can prepare for the extremes of weather.
Meanwhile, there is speculation that global warming may be
compounding El Nino's effect. In other words, YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET. Reported by Carl Zimmer, senior editor of Discover.

CROWNED: A NEW MATZO BALL-EATING CHAMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was while swallowing his ninth matzo ball that
Russell Machover's face turned purple, his eyelids fluttered, and
it looked for a moment like he might pass out.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the 41-year-old investment banker from Long Island _ a
graduate of Harvard University, class of 1980 _ took a couple
breaths, sipped some water, and soldiered on to become the new
Ben's Kosher Delicatessen Matzo Ball-Eating Champion of the World.
</P>
<P>
   Machover ate 11 1/4 matzo balls in 5 minutes and 25 seconds
Tuesday _ beating out seven other contestants and tying one,
another Long Islander, Corey Barrett, not half his age.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, in the tie-breaking eat-off, Machover
downed a stunning 5 1/2 matzo balls in a mere 85 seconds _ one full
ball more than Barrett could manage.
</P>
<P>
   A diabetic, Machover then took a quick blood-sugar reading and a
shot of insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan's in Coney Island holds a hot-dog eating contest every
summer. Carnegie Deli in midtown Manahttan has an annual
pickle-eating contest. But Ben's, a deli empire with 11 locations
in Manhattan, Queens, and Long Island, is the only known
establishment on the planet that hosts a race to consume the most
matzo balls.
</P>
<P>
   There are good reasons for this uniqueness: Even by the
standards of food-contest mavens, anyone who wolfs down matzo balls
at high speed has got to be more than a little meshugginah.
</P>
<P>
   Machover himself described the experience after his victory:
``It's like shoveling cement down your esophagus.''
</P>
<P>
   Matzo ball soup is a staple of every Jewish deli, the balls
consisting of matzo meal (from unleavened flour), baking powder,
white pepper, salt, and chicken fat, or, in some places these days,
soybean oil.
</P>
<P>
   Connoisseurs distinguish between two kinds of matzo balls _
floaters and sinkers. Floaters are big, airy, a little sweet, and
go easy on the stomach. Sinkers are smaller but hard, dense, and
rip straight through the digestive system.
</P>
<P>
   Ben's matzo balls fuse the more awesome aspects of both worlds:
big as baseballs and nearly as heavy. To eat a bowl of soup at
Ben's, with just one matzo ball bobbing in the broth, is to consume
a hearty meal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how they do it,'' Ronnie Dragoon, Ben's owner,
said with a laugh when asked about the contestants' feats.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Sliwa, founder of the Guardian Angels and a popular local
talk-radio host, has won Carnegie's pickle-eating contest several
times and regularly places third or fourth in Nathan's hot-dog
eating contest. ``But nothing matches these things'' he said,
shaking his head solemnly. ``It takes a man's man to sit here and
devour the matzo balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Sliwa, the event's emcee, entered Ben's competition last year
but was disqualified for crushing the matzo balls into little
slivers and leaving behind the crumbs of one ball before going on
to the next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the only gentile competing,'' Sliwa shrugged. ``How am I
supposed to know the right way to eat a matzo ball?''
</P>
<P>
   Machover, who has been eating at Ben's since he was a kid,
boasted before the contest that he had devised ``a secret
technique'' for winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are big, round, watered-down matzo balls, so what you
need to do,'' he explained, lowering his voice to a whisper, ``is
cut one in half with a fork, squish it in your mouth so it's almost
like mush, then swallow. You also have to wash it down with a lot
of water.''
</P>
<P>
   The contest, which took place at Ben's midtown Manhattan branch,
brought together the winners of ``regional'' matches held last
month at five other Ben's delis in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The odds-on favorite was Bruce D. Stock, a postal worker from
Howard Beach and last year's winner (13 1/2 matzo balls in 5
minutes, 25 seconds), who brought along his trainer and his
nutritionist. But this time out, his cool, steady approach proved
no match for Machover's juggernaut intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krazy Kevin'' Lipsitz, the president of a
magazine-distribution service in Staten Island, another regional
winner, is well-known among food-competition insiders for training
with his dogs. ``I watch how they chew and swallow their dog
food,'' Lipsitz said before the contest. ``matzo balls have about
the same consistency.''

   Ed ``The Animal'' Kratchie, the American hot-dog eating champ,
was expected to compete, but he did not show up _ which elicited
hisses of contempt from the audience. ``It may be that Kratchie's
day is over!'' thundered Gersh Kuntzman, a New York Post columnist
who calls himself ``the Homer of hot-dog eating contests'' and
served as a judge.

   Machover, who wore a Harvard T-shirt underneath the
standard-issue Ben's apron, won a trophy cup and a $2,500 gift
certificate from a local appliance store. Through entry fees and
sponsor donations, the contest raised $5,000 for the Interfaith
Nutrition Network, a feed-the-hungry organization.

   Like many other researchers, Michael Zasloff made his discovery
as a fortuitous accident while doing unrelated studies. He was
doing genetic research on frogs when he noticed that after he
operated on them in a nonsterile environment, the wounds never
became infected. Hypothesizing that something in their skin was
protecting them from bacterial attack, he discovered a peptide,
which he named magainin. He proceeded to find peptide antibiotics
in a host of other animals. Zasloff is turning these peptides into
antibiotic drugs for humans in the hope of providing an alternative
or an adjunct to existing drugs. Clinical trials are now taking
place. Josie Glausiusz is an associate editor at Discover magazine.

   El Nino helped make 1998 the hottest year ever recorded. Its
dramatic weather changes have been linked to an upsurge of diseases
such as cholera, malaria and dengue fever around the globe, as well
as a brutal drought in Texas, wildfires in Indonesia and Brazil,
marine mammal deaths in the western Pacific and a host of other
woes. Scientists are hard at work trying to improve their ability
to predict El Ninos so we can prepare for the extremes of weather.
Meanwhile, there is speculation that global warming may be
compounding El Nino's effect. In other words, YOU AIN'T SEEN
NOTHING YET. Reported by Carl Zimmer, senior editor of Discover.

   At Magainin Pharmaceuticals, in leafy Plymouth Meeting, Pa.,
amphibians abound. A plastic toad guards the entrance, startling
strangers with a mournful mechanical croak. A beanbag frog sits
atop the desk of Magainin's founder, Michael Zasloff. And in a tank
that Zasloff keeps in his lab swim a clutch of African clawed
frogs, Xenopus laevis.
</P>
<P>
   The fun begins when he lifts one out. Grasping the squirming
frog firmly in his hand, Zasloff sprinkles a dried form of the
hormone adrenaline on its back and rubs it in.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, hundreds of tiny white spots dot the frog's
skin, then slowly merge into a creamy sheen. Zasloff calls the
white film ``a beautiful bandage'' because it's filled with
bacteria-killing antibiotic peptides _ small strings of amino
acids, which are the building blocks of all proteins.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of one of these peptides, which Zasloff named
magainin after the Hebrew word magain, or ``shield,'' inspired him
to found the company of the same name 11 years ago. He wasn't
looking for unconventional antibiotics at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As a physician and molecular biologist researching gene
expression at the National Institutes of Health, he was harvesting
immature eggs from Xenopus ovaries. Although he operated on the
frogs in nonsterile conditions and then returned them to
microbe-infested water tanks, their wounds never became infected or
even showed signs of inflammation. Zasloff concluded that something
in the frogs' skin was protecting them from bacterial attack.
</P>
<P>
   So he took a piece of skin, ground it up and extracted its
protective component, which turned out to be a peptide. Magainin,
he found, is discharged onto the frog's skin in response to
adrenaline, which is released when pain receptors in the skin send
the brain a message that an injury has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Since that early find, Zasloff has discovered peptide
antibiotics in all manner of places: the airway and tongue of a
cow, the gut of a pig, the stomach of the spiny dogfish shark.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are in on the hunt, too, and they have found
peptide antibiotics in a witches' brew of beasts: in silk moths,
fruit flies, honeybees and budworms; in salamanders, snakes and
horseshoe crabs; in the white blood cells of pigs and cows and
humans; in our skin; and in fish, birds and even plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are now recognized in every species of life, from the
smallest to the biggest, from things that fly or swim or just sit
around on rocks to human beings _ all defend themselves with
antimicrobial peptides,'' says microbiologist Bob Hancock of the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver. ``And they're a very
large proportion of what protects us daily from infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock and Zasloff are among a handful of pioneers who are
turning these peptides into antibiotic drugs in hopes of someday
providing an alternative or an adjunct to currently available
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The need for new antibiotics is becoming increasingly urgent as
misuse and overuse of conventional antibiotics has bred resistance
in many common disease-causing bacteria. And so the possibility of
new antibiotics with novel modes of action that may be immune to
resistance is exciting news.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them are even active against some disease-causing
protozoans, fungi and viruses such as Herpes simplex and HIV.
Still, it must be stressed that although some of these new peptides
are undergoing clinical trials, none have yet emerged into general
use, and many problems in their manufacture remain.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these new peptide antibiotics different from
penicillin and its kin is that they stem from animals' own immune
defenses rather than from other microbes. That means they have
spent millions of years in an evolutionary battle with invasive
bacteria and have emerged victorious time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, not many peptide antibiotics are on their way to
the clinic, and even those currently undergoing testing would have
only limited use. One reason for the slow pace is the cost of
bringing a drug to market, which has been estimated to cost about
$300 million, including clinical trials. Another major expense is
producing peptide antimicrobials in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, some peptides are beginning the
arduous trek to market. One of the most promising is a compound
called BPI (for ``bactericidal/permeability-increasing'' protein),
originally derived from human neutrophils and developed for
clinical use by a small Berkeley, Calif., company called Xoma.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Xoma published the results of a clinical trial
of BPI for the treatment of meningococcemia, a virulent infection
that affects nearly 3,000 children a year in the United States.
This condition can progress from flulike symptoms to death within
one or two days. The trial showed that BPI could significantly
reduce the death rate from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Could antimicrobial peptides ever replace the antibiotics to
which so many bacteria have become resistant? Zasloff thinks they
can as a last resort; however, he thinks it equally likely they'll
be used to complement existing antibiotics, since the damage they
do to bacterial membranes can open the door to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical microbiologist Fred Tenover of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who specializes in the molecular
biology of antimicrobial resistance, paints a darker picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there's a meeting called ICAAC _ the Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy _ and we see
poster after poster of new drugs, some totally synthetic, some
natural products, that inhibit wide ranges of bacteria at very low
concentrations,'' he says. ``But three years later they're never
heard of again because they're either too toxic or cause
significant side effects, or trigger an immune response. So it's
hard to look into the crystal ball and say these really are the
future of antibiotic therapy until we see how they do in
well-controlled clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tenover remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteria have been around for more than 3 billion years, and
they've developed pretty good ways of figuring out how to overcome
just about anything. So we're happy to see lots of new things
coming down the road.''

one or two days. The trial showed that BPI could significantly
reduce the death rate from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Could antimicrobial peptides ever replace the antibiotics to
which so many bacteria have become resistant? Zasloff thinks they
can as a last resort; however, he thinks it equally likely they'll
be used to complement existing antibiotics, since the damage they
do to bacterial membranes can open the door to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical microbiologist Fred Tenover of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who specializes in the molecular
biology of antimicrobial resistance, paints a darker picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there's a meeting called ICAAC _ the Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy _ and we see
poster after poster of new drugs, some totally synthetic, some
natural products, that inhibit wide ranges of bacteria at very low
concentrations,'' he says. ``But three years later they're never
heard of again because they're either too toxic or cause
significant side effects, or trigger an immune response. So it's
hard to look into the crystal ball and say these really are the
future of antibiotic therapy until we see how they do in
well-controlled clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tenover remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteria have been around for more than 3 billion years, and
they've developed pretty good ways of figuring out how to overcome
just about anything. So we're happy to see lots of new things
coming down the road.''

<P>
   When 1998 began, East Africa should have been at its most
beautiful. Normally the short rainy season ends in December, but
this year was different.
</P>
<P>
   The rains were heavy and long. Camels, cows, sheep and goats all
started dying of violent fevers. Soon people, too, began to get
sick. The disease was Rift Valley fever, caused by an obscure
mosquito-borne virus. It pops up every few years in Africa when
standing water encourages mosquito eggs to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   At least 89,000 people caught the disease _ about 200 died _ and
animal owners reported losing up to 90 percent of their herds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet catastrophic as the East African floods were, they had to
jostle for the world's attention with other cases of strange
weather _ with unusual occurrences of droughts, fires, rains, cold
snaps and heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   Every year brings its own grab bag of such anomalies, but this
year many of them could be linked to a phenomenon in the empty
expanses of the equatorial Pacific _ a change in the ocean currents
and winds that began in the early months of 1997 and that altered
weather patterns around the world. The change in the weather was,
of course, the work of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, El Nino had already become a celebrity of
sorts _ in storm-battered California, television news programs
offered a tabloid flurry of El Nino updates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, El Nino's effects on the world came into full
flower. It helped make the year the hottest ever recorded. In
addition to Rift Valley fever, El Nino has been linked to an
upsurge in diseases ranging from cholera to malaria to dengue
fever, in Kenya, Cambodia, Peru and other countries scattered
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now trying to figure out how they can use this
year's experiences to predict what the future will bring _ both in
the next few months and in future decades. The good news is that
they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El
Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in
advance. The bad news is that according to some research this
latest El Nino might be a preview of the weather to come in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, researchers have become better prepared for El
Nino, thanks to the work of ocean modelers like Mark Cane and
Stephen Zebiak of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory. In the mid-1980s Cane and Zebiak wanted a miniature
Pacific they could play with, a simulation in which they could shut
off this wind or that current to see which factors were most
important to El Nino's existence.
</P>
<P>
   They built a simple computer model, and almost as an
afterthought they tried to use it to predict real El Ninos. It
accurately predicted the onset of the next El Nino, in 1986; then,
in the early 1990s, months in advance of each one, it predicted the
onset of a string of El Ninos.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists began building more sophisticated computer
models. By late 1996 the new models had outperformed their
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able
to give much better forecasts. To that end, Lamont-Doherty and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography have joined forces to create
the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction along
New York's Hudson River. Its 80 scientists will be dedicated to
making climate predictions up to a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their effort will have to go into making better computer
models. Rather than relying on the historical averages of El Nino's
behavior, they will be trying to simulate the whole shebang, from
the initial slosh of the Pacific to the downpours in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the researchers hope to take what they learn about
El Nino and use it to understand trickier oscillations in other
parts of the world's ocean, such as the rise and fall of sea
surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. That might make it
possible to reliably predict climate many months in advance even in
years without a big El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, for example, that the power and the frequency
of El Ninos may rise and fall according to vast cycles of the
Pacific Ocean. It's clear that from decade to decade the nature of
El Nino does change.
</P>
<P>
   From 1885 to 1915, for example, El Ninos were powerful, but from
1915 to 1950 they were minuscule. After 1960 they picked up again,
and since the late 1970s they've been very big.
</P>
<P>
   The work of researchers, combined with El Nino's power this
year, has made clear that it is far more than a matter of the
occasional bad fish catch. El Nino represents the fickleness of a
powerful ocean that can focus its energy on the world's weather
with stunning swiftness.
</P>
<P>
   Cane and Zebiak have recently been studying the quirkiness of
the Pacific on the scale of hundreds of thousands of years. One of
the most startling things they've found is the ability of the ocean
to sometimes shift abruptly into an El Nino-like pattern and then
stay that way for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Cane speculates that by behaving this way, the Pacific may go so
far as to kick the planet in and out of ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   Cane himself admits that his extrapolating from today's El Ninos
to the past may be ``outrageous.'' Extrapolating into the future is
even more hazardous. Yet it's possible, and certainly worth
contemplating, that someday El Nino will stop making the occasional
visits we're now used to and settle in for a long, long stay.

<P>
   At Magainin Pharmaceuticals, in leafy Plymouth Meeting, Pa.,
amphibians abound. A plastic toad guards the entrance, startling
strangers with a mournful mechanical croak. A beanbag frog sits
atop the desk of Magainin's founder, Michael Zasloff. And in a tank
that Zasloff keeps in his lab swim a clutch of African clawed
frogs, Xenopus laevis.
</P>
<P>
   The fun begins when he lifts one out. Grasping the squirming
frog firmly in his hand, Zasloff sprinkles a dried form of the
hormone adrenaline on its back and rubs it in.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, hundreds of tiny white spots dot the frog's
skin, then slowly merge into a creamy sheen. Zasloff calls the
white film ``a beautiful bandage'' because it's filled with
bacteria-killing antibiotic peptides _ small strings of amino
acids, which are the building blocks of all proteins.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of one of these peptides, which Zasloff named
magainin after the Hebrew word magain, or ``shield,'' inspired him
to found the company of the same name 11 years ago. He wasn't
looking for unconventional antibiotics at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As a physician and molecular biologist researching gene
expression at the National Institutes of Health, he was harvesting
immature eggs from Xenopus ovaries. Although he operated on the
frogs in nonsterile conditions and then returned them to
microbe-infested water tanks, their wounds never became infected or
even showed signs of inflammation. Zasloff concluded that something
in the frogs' skin was protecting them from bacterial attack.
</P>
<P>
   So he took a piece of skin, ground it up and extracted its
protective component, which turned out to be a peptide. Magainin,
he found, is discharged onto the frog's skin in response to
adrenaline, which is released when pain receptors in the skin send
the brain a message that an injury has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Since that early find, Zasloff has discovered peptide
antibiotics in all manner of places: the airway and tongue of a
cow, the gut of a pig, the stomach of the spiny dogfish shark.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are in on the hunt, too, and they have found
peptide antibiotics in a witches' brew of beasts: in silk moths,
fruit flies, honeybees and budworms; in salamanders, snakes and
horseshoe crabs; in the white blood cells of pigs and cows and
humans; in our skin; and in fish, birds and even plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are now recognized in every species of life, from the
smallest to the biggest, from things that fly or swim or just sit
around on rocks to human beings _ all defend themselves with
antimicrobial peptides,'' says microbiologist Bob Hancock of the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver. ``And they're a very
large proportion of what protects us daily from infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock and Zasloff are among a handful of pioneers who are
turning these peptides into antibiotic drugs in hopes of someday
providing an alternative or an adjunct to currently available
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The need for new antibiotics is becoming increasingly urgent as
misuse and overuse of conventional antibiotics has bred resistance
in many common disease-causing bacteria. And so the possibility of
new antibiotics with novel modes of action that may be immune to
resistance is exciting news.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them are even active against some disease-causing
protozoans, fungi and viruses such as Herpes simplex and HIV.
Still, it must be stressed that although some of these new peptides
are undergoing clinical trials, none have yet emerged into general
use, and many problems in their manufacture remain.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these new peptide antibiotics different from
penicillin and its kin is that they stem from animals' own immune
defenses rather than from other microbes. That means they have
spent millions of years in an evolutionary battle with invasive
bacteria and have emerged victorious time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, not many peptide antibiotics are on their way to
the clinic, and even those currently undergoing testing would have
only limited use. One reason for the slow pace is the cost of
bringing a drug to market, which has been estimated to cost about
$300 million, including clinical trials. Another major expense is
producing peptide antimicrobials in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, some peptides are beginning the
arduous trek to market. One of the most promising is a compound
called BPI (for ``bactericidal/permeability-increasing'' protein),
originally derived from human neutrophils and developed for
clinical use by a small Berkeley, Calif., company called Xoma.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Xoma published the results of a clinical trial
of BPI for the treatment of meningococcemia, a virulent infection
that affects nearly 3,000 children a year in the United States.
This condition can progress from flulike symptoms to death within
one or two days. The trial showed that BPI could significantly
reduce the death rate from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Could antimicrobial peptides ever replace the antibiotics to
which so many bacteria have become resistant? Zasloff thinks they
can as a last resort; however, he thinks it equally likely they'll
be used to complement existing antibiotics, since the damage they
do to bacterial membranes can open the door to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical microbiologist Fred Tenover of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who specializes in the molecular
biology of antimicrobial resistance, paints a darker picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there's a meeting called ICAAC _ the Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy _ and we see
poster after poster of new drugs, some totally synthetic, some
natural products, that inhibit wide ranges of bacteria at very low
concentrations,'' he says. ``But three years later they're never
heard of again because they're either too toxic or cause
significant side effects, or trigger an immune response. So it's
hard to look into the crystal ball and say these really are the
future of antibiotic therapy until we see how they do in
well-controlled clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tenover remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteria have been around for more than 3 billion years, and
they've developed pretty good ways of figuring out how to overcome
just about anything. So we're happy to see lots of new things
coming down the road.''

that Zasloff keeps in his lab swim a clutch of African clawed
frogs, Xenopus laevis.
</P>
<P>
   The fun begins when he lifts one out. Grasping the squirming
frog firmly in his hand, Zasloff sprinkles a dried form of the
hormone adrenaline on its back and rubs it in.
</P>
<P>
   Within seconds, hundreds of tiny white spots dot the frog's
skin, then slowly merge into a creamy sheen. Zasloff calls the
white film ``a beautiful bandage'' because it's filled with
bacteria-killing antibiotic peptides _ small strings of amino
acids, which are the building blocks of all proteins.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of one of these peptides, which Zasloff named
magainin after the Hebrew word magain, or ``shield,'' inspired him
to found the company of the same name 11 years ago. He wasn't
looking for unconventional antibiotics at the time.
</P>
<P>
   As a physician and molecular biologist researching gene
expression at the National Institutes of Health, he was harvesting
immature eggs from Xenopus ovaries. Although he operated on the
frogs in nonsterile conditions and then returned them to
microbe-infested water tanks, their wounds never became infected or
even showed signs of inflammation. Zasloff concluded that something
in the frogs' skin was protecting them from bacterial attack.
</P>
<P>
   So he took a piece of skin, ground it up and extracted its
protective component, which turned out to be a peptide. Magainin,
he found, is discharged onto the frog's skin in response to
adrenaline, which is released when pain receptors in the skin send
the brain a message that an injury has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Since that early find, Zasloff has discovered peptide
antibiotics in all manner of places: the airway and tongue of a
cow, the gut of a pig, the stomach of the spiny dogfish shark.
</P>
<P>
   Other researchers are in on the hunt, too, and they have found
peptide antibiotics in a witches' brew of beasts: in silk moths,
fruit flies, honeybees and budworms; in salamanders, snakes and
horseshoe crabs; in the white blood cells of pigs and cows and
humans; in our skin; and in fish, birds and even plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are now recognized in every species of life, from the
smallest to the biggest, from things that fly or swim or just sit
around on rocks to human beings _ all defend themselves with
antimicrobial peptides,'' says microbiologist Bob Hancock of the
University of British Columbia in Vancouver. ``And they're a very
large proportion of what protects us daily from infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Hancock and Zasloff are among a handful of pioneers who are
turning these peptides into antibiotic drugs in hopes of someday
providing an alternative or an adjunct to currently available
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   The need for new antibiotics is becoming increasingly urgent as
misuse and overuse of conventional antibiotics has bred resistance
in many common disease-causing bacteria. And so the possibility of
new antibiotics with novel modes of action that may be immune to
resistance is exciting news.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them are even active against some disease-causing
protozoans, fungi and viruses such as Herpes simplex and HIV.
Still, it must be stressed that although some of these new peptides
are undergoing clinical trials, none have yet emerged into general
use, and many problems in their manufacture remain.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these new peptide antibiotics different from
penicillin and its kin is that they stem from animals' own immune
defenses rather than from other microbes. That means they have
spent millions of years in an evolutionary battle with invasive
bacteria and have emerged victorious time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, not many peptide antibiotics are on their way to
the clinic, and even those currently undergoing testing would have
only limited use. One reason for the slow pace is the cost of
bringing a drug to market, which has been estimated to cost about
$300 million, including clinical trials. Another major expense is
producing peptide antimicrobials in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, some peptides are beginning the
arduous trek to market. One of the most promising is a compound
called BPI (for ``bactericidal/permeability-increasing'' protein),
originally derived from human neutrophils and developed for
clinical use by a small Berkeley, Calif., company called Xoma.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Xoma published the results of a clinical trial
of BPI for the treatment of meningococcemia, a virulent infection
that affects nearly 3,000 children a year in the United States.
This condition can progress from flulike symptoms to death within
one or two days. The trial showed that BPI could significantly
reduce the death rate from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Could antimicrobial peptides ever replace the antibiotics to
which so many bacteria have become resistant? Zasloff thinks they
can as a last resort; however, he thinks it equally likely they'll
be used to complement existing antibiotics, since the damage they
do to bacterial membranes can open the door to other drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinical microbiologist Fred Tenover of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta, who specializes in the molecular
biology of antimicrobial resistance, paints a darker picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year there's a meeting called ICAAC _ the Interscience
Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy _ and we see
poster after poster of new drugs, some totally synthetic, some
natural products, that inhibit wide ranges of bacteria at very low
concentrations,'' he says. ``But three years later they're never
heard of again because they're either too toxic or cause
significant side effects, or trigger an immune response. So it's
hard to look into the crystal ball and say these really are the
future of antibiotic therapy until we see how they do in
well-controlled clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Tenover remains hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacteria have been around for more than 3 billion years, and
they've developed pretty good ways of figuring out how to overcome
just about anything. So we're happy to see lots of new things
coming down the road.''

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   When 1998 began, East Africa should have been at its most
beautiful. Normally the short rainy season ends in December, but
this year was different.
</P>
<P>
   The rains were heavy and long. Camels, cows, sheep and goats all
started dying of violent fevers. Soon people, too, began to get
sick. The disease was Rift Valley fever, caused by an obscure
mosquito-borne virus. It pops up every few years in Africa when
standing water encourages mosquito eggs to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   At least 89,000 people caught the disease _ about 200 died _ and
animal owners reported losing up to 90 percent of their herds.
</P>
<P>
   Yet catastrophic as the East African floods were, they had to
jostle for the world's attention with other cases of strange
weather _ with unusual occurrences of droughts, fires, rains, cold
snaps and heat waves.
</P>
<P>
   Every year brings its own grab bag of such anomalies, but this
year many of them could be linked to a phenomenon in the empty
expanses of the equatorial Pacific _ a change in the ocean currents
and winds that began in the early months of 1997 and that altered
weather patterns around the world. The change in the weather was,
of course, the work of El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1997, El Nino had already become a celebrity of
sorts _ in storm-battered California, television news programs
offered a tabloid flurry of El Nino updates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, however, El Nino's effects on the world came into full
flower. It helped make the year the hottest ever recorded. In
addition to Rift Valley fever, El Nino has been linked to an
upsurge in diseases ranging from cholera to malaria to dengue
fever, in Kenya, Cambodia, Peru and other countries scattered
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists are now trying to figure out how they can use this
year's experiences to predict what the future will bring _ both in
the next few months and in future decades. The good news is that
they can now forecast an El Nino with some precision, and during El
Nino years predict its effect on the world's weather months in
advance. The bad news is that according to some research this
latest El Nino might be a preview of the weather to come in the
next century.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, researchers have become better prepared for El
Nino, thanks to the work of ocean modelers like Mark Cane and
Stephen Zebiak of Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth
Observatory. In the mid-1980s Cane and Zebiak wanted a miniature
Pacific they could play with, a simulation in which they could shut
off this wind or that current to see which factors were most
important to El Nino's existence.
</P>
<P>
   They built a simple computer model, and almost as an
afterthought they tried to use it to predict real El Ninos. It
accurately predicted the onset of the next El Nino, in 1986; then,
in the early 1990s, months in advance of each one, it predicted the
onset of a string of El Ninos.
</P>
<P>
   Other scientists began building more sophisticated computer
models. By late 1996 the new models had outperformed their
predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the next El Nino arrives, scientists hope to be able
to give much better forecasts. To that end, Lamont-Doherty and
Scripps Institution of Oceanography have joined forces to create
the International Research Institute for Climate Prediction along
New York's Hudson River. Its 80 scientists will be dedicated to
making climate predictions up to a year in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their effort will have to go into making better computer
models. Rather than relying on the historical averages of El Nino's
behavior, they will be trying to simulate the whole shebang, from
the initial slosh of the Pacific to the downpours in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the researchers hope to take what they learn about
El Nino and use it to understand trickier oscillations in other
parts of the world's ocean, such as the rise and fall of sea
surface temperatures in the North Atlantic. That might make it
possible to reliably predict climate many months in advance even in
years without a big El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs, for example, that the power and the frequency
of El Ninos may rise and fall according to vast cycles of the
Pacific Ocean. It's clear that from decade to decade the nature of
El Nino does change.
</P>
<P>
   From 1885 to 1915, for example, El Ninos were powerful, but from
1915 to 1950 they were minuscule. After 1960 they picked up again,
and since the late 1970s they've been very big.
</P>
<P>
   The work of researchers, combined with El Nino's power this
year, has made clear that it is far more than a matter of the
occasional bad fish catch. El Nino represents the fickleness of a
powerful ocean that can focus its energy on the world's weather
with stunning swiftness.
</P>
<P>
   Cane and Zebiak have recently been studying the quirkiness of
the Pacific on the scale of hundreds of thousands of years. One of
the most startling things they've found is the ability of the ocean
to sometimes shift abruptly into an El Nino-like pattern and then
stay that way for thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Cane speculates that by behaving this way, the Pacific may go so
far as to kick the planet in and out of ice ages.
</P>
<P>
   Cane himself admits that his extrapolating from today's El Ninos
to the past may be ``outrageous.'' Extrapolating into the future is
even more hazardous. Yet it's possible, and certainly worth
contemplating, that someday El Nino will stop making the occasional
visits we're now used to and settle in for a long, long stay.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Falwell's quasi-apologies are old-hat
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Feb. 7, 1999.
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that the Rev. Jerry Falwell has apologized for publicly
stating that the Antichrist is a Jewish male who probably is alive
today, are we all expected to turn the other cheek and forgive the
man?
</P>
<P>
   What for? This isn't the first time he's done something like
this.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he went to South Africa to voice support for the white
regime there and called Bishop Desmond Tutu ``a phony,'' adding
that Tutu was not a legitimate leader of South Africa's blacks.
</P>
<P>
   He apologized for that, too, much in the way he apologized for
the Antichrist remark: partly.
</P>
<P>
   He said he did not mean to impugn Tutu's religious role or
integrity but maintained that any claim by Tutu that he was a
political spokesman for South African blacks was phony. And he
stuck by that. Even President Reagan, a close friend of Falwell's,
disavowed the reverend's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   In his stirring of anti-Jewish emotions several weeks ago, after
he told a Tennessee audience that the Antichrist was a Jew, Falwell
defended himself with a press statement saying that, based on
certain portions of the Scriptures, he really believes what he
said. (He also said there is honest disagreement among evangelical
Christians about that issue, that some believe the Antichrist will
be a Gentile.)
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he admitted later, the Tennessee sermon lacked
tact and judgment. So he apologized, not for what he believes _ he
still thinks the Antichrist is a Jew _ but for making the statement
publicly. But, he concluded, he did not think his Antichrist
pronouncement to be anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   And now we are to forgive, I suppose.
</P>
<P>
   There are some guys who can get away with shooting their mouths
off and some who cannot. Falwell presumably can; so can Reggie
White, the football player/ordained minister who made that medieval
speech to the Wisconsin
</P>
<P>
   Legislature last March stereotyping Hispanics, Jews, blacks and
homosexuals. He had a great season for the Green Bay Packers, never
had to apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Two men who could not get away with it were Los Angeles Dodgers
executive Al Campanis and CBS football analyst Jimmy ``The Greek''
Snyder. After they made comments regarding anatomical abilities or
disabilities of black athletes, they were exiled into a land-based
hell, eventually to their graves.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not defending those two men, although what Snyder said could
be defended, but I'm trying to determine why they were cast out
while Falwell and White were not. Does this have something to do
with the fact that they are ministers? Can ordained persons get
away with anything?
</P>
<P>
   Falwell, when he's not partly apologizing for his incendiary
remarks, spends much of his time trying to convince the public that
Bill Clinton had a hand in the murders of everyone who has died in
the last few decades; videotapes and booklets available for a
price.
</P>
<P>
   He leaps across the line between religion and politics as the
separation of church and state becomes even more blurred these
days.
</P>
<P>
   There are some in the Christian Right who do have tact and
judgment. Falwell doesn't. ``I apologize to my Jewish friends here
and around the world and I apologize to the Christians here for
having created any kind of rift,'' he said last week.
</P>
<P>
   And what will he say next for which he will later apologize?
What he needs to learn is to control his mouth from the start. I
know he's entitled to his beliefs; I've got a bunch of my own. But
I know when and not when to enunciate them.
</P>
<P>
   What I would like to do with Falwell is what my mother always
did with me when I uttered a profanity: Wash his mouth out with
soap!

<P>
   The Impeachment Two-Step that many Republican senators are
tempted to dance is a constitutional abomination that, of all
people, legislators who fancy themselves conservative should recoil
from with horror.
</P>
<P>
   The framers of the Constitution pointedly set the high threshold
of a two-thirds majority for conviction by the Senate to avoid just
the sort of sly partisanship that would be enshrined in precedent
if the Senate goes through with this mischief.
</P>
<P>
   No less conservative a legal scholar than Robert Bork has argued
persuasively against the approach.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme would first have the Senate vote on whether, as a
matter of fact, the president is guilty as the House asserts. A
majority _ readily available, of course _ would make that
declaration. Then a second vote would decide whether President
Clinton should be removed. That would take the two-thirds vote that
is not at hand.
</P>
<P>
   There is a surface appeal to this approach, if only by analogy.
Don't courts first decide guilt or innocence and then, if the
verdict is guilty, decide punishment? Indeed, but impeachment isn't
a copy of criminal trials and wasn't meant to be. It is a
profoundly political process, meant to remove officials whose
misdeeds are judged to pose a danger to the fundamental workings of
the state, issues of criminal guilt or innocence aside.
</P>
<P>
   Even sticking with the lame comparison, however, the suggested
approach fails. For the procedure's imitation court findings to be
valid, a judge would first have to consider, as the impeachment
process has not, whether the charges are specific enough, whether
evidence was illegally obtained and whether prosecutorial
misconduct tainted any hope of a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
   But there are far larger reasons for shunning this approach than
its mere failure as an analogy.
</P>
<P>
   First, if the idea isn't unconstitutional it is certainly
extra-constitutional, subverting the express intent of the framers.
The Constitution says that upon impeachment and conviction, a
president ``shall'' be removed from office. It doesn't say
``whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Second, the precedent would set subsequent presidencies up for
harassment by quasi-impeachment whenever the White House and
Congress were in different partisan hands. The constitutional
balance of power between the executive and legislative branches
would be permanently distorted.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans are playing with this goofy idea for several
political reasons and no good ones.
</P>
<P>
   They don't want to seem to be saying House Republicans went off
half cocked. (But they did!) They fear Clinton will otherwise claim
he has been exonerated. (Unlikely. He must know many who have hung
with him would gag on that. But even if he did, so what?) And the
ploy would, heh-heh, corner Democrats into appearing to vote to
retain a president who has been proved guilty. (Of something; the
articles are vague.)
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution doesn't suggest the Senate hold a kangaroo
court. It calls for a straight up or down vote on the articles of
impeachment, period. It is time to take that vote.

IN SWITCH, BOSTON WON'T APPEAL THE LATIN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY AND ANDY DABILIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston School Committee, fearing possible damage to school
desegregation efforts nationwide, has decided not to ask the
Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of the city's
admissions policy for Boston Latin School.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote comes after weeks of intense campaigning by
local and national minority and education leaders to persuade the
committee not to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Those groups, including the NAACP and the US Department of
Education, believed the case would lose before a high court
unfriendly to affirmative action, thus leaving school systems
across the nation vulnerable to challenges from parents who don't
want race-based student assignment of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case that would be isolated to Boston,'' said
Boston School Superintendent Thomas Payzant after the vote. ``The
whole country would have to live with the decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two months ago, the School Committee said the case was so
important it had to be decided by the Supreme Court, and voted to
appeal. Wednesday night, School Committee members and Payzant
defended that choice, saying it was the only one available at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   The prestigious school has been challenged twice in the past
three years by white students asserting the race-based admissions
policy was unconstitutional and unfairly cost them seats at Latin.
</P>
<P>
   The decision does not affect next year's admissions to Latin and
the city's two other exam schools. The committee had already
decided to have a race-blind admissions policy for the magnet
schools while the case was being appealed. But now, the School
Committee will have to devise a new admissions policy that will
both withstand constitutional scrutiny and ensure some level of
diversity in the exam schools.
</P>
<P>
   They also will have to do the same for exam-school prep classes.
The committee voted 4-2 Wednesday to have a one-year race-blind
admission policy for those classes also.
</P>
<P>
   Any formula will be difficult: A federal court has twice ruled
that two admissions policies were too unfavorable to white
students. The latest policy that school officials had to dismantle
admitted half of the students to the exam schools based on test
scores and grades only, while the other half were admitted based on
scores, grades, and race. The original policy had set aside 35
percent of seats for blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be hard. But it's almost like a diversion when they
start talking about diversity,'' said Steve Backman, a Boston
public school parent who wants the system to use other admission
criteria for the exams schools, such as examples of student work.
``The reason so many people are so unhappy with who gets in is
because they only rely on one test. We need other methods.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a Dorchester ninth-grader became the second white
girl to challenge Latin's admission policy, saying she was denied
entrance despite scoring better than minorities who got a seat. The
School Committee's policy prevailed in a lower court but, in
November, an appeals court ruled it was unconstitutional and
ordered the plaintiff, Sarah Wessmann, to be admitted to the
school. The School Committee decided to appeal in December.
</P>
<P>
   The School Committee's reversal highlights a new, concerted
national effort by civil rights groups to keep public school
affirmative action away from the conservative court. The Supreme
Court has never ruled on a secondary public school race-based
admission policy. But it has consistently ruled against affirmative
action cases in the public and higher education sector.
</P>
<P>
   In Piscataway, N.J., the School Board in 1997 decided not to
defend to the Supreme Court the layoff of a white teacher to retain
a black teacher. The board settled the case using money from civil
rights groups, in part to avoid giving the Supreme Court a possible
precedent-setting case, according to news accounts.
</P>
<P>
   And Boston, national, and local leaders said that was their
reasoning in urging the committee not to appeal. The NAACP, which
was part of the original case, loudly decried the planned appeal in
recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have over 50 years of history and clearly, the case is not
strong enough,'' said Leonard Alkins, head of the Boston NAACP
branch. ``The nationwide dangers outweigh any benefit to the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the decision may have some minority leaders and
school superintendents nationwide breathing a sigh of relief over
busing programs, Boston is already facing an end to its 25-year
desegregation program. Two weeks ago, Mayor Thomas M. Menino
declared that the city will return to neighborhood schools within
six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote is an indication they are at the end of the road and
reality is staring them in the face,'' said City Councilor at Large
Peggy Davis-Mullen. ``They need to proceed to not assigning any
student to schools by race.''

   Here are some of the best. All packages are double occupancy and

</P>
<P>
   The inn's two newly opened restaurants, ``9545'' and the more
casual ``10 Below,'' are part of Drew Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant

Tribeca Grill. Rates begin at $385 per night.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the Lake Tahoe region, the Resort at Squaw Creek (400 Squaw
Creek Rd., Olympic Valley, Calif. 96146; 800-327-3353) is an
imposing glass building artfully tucked into the woods. Inside are
surprisingly warm rooms with a nouvelle Arts &AMP; Crafts feel. There

   In Buenos Aires the elegant neighborhood of Recoleta is the
fashionable place to stay, to while away hours in cafes and
museums, to walk the poodles in the park. And when it's all over,
it's the place to end up.
</P>

   Across the grassy way from the outdoor cafes, a great white
portal marks the most exclusive address of all: Cementerio de la
Recoleta, Recoleta Cemetery, burial place of Argentina's elite.
Here patricians and presidents, heroes and heroines, rest in
astonishing grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   Mausoleums built side by side resemble Greek temples, Gothic
chapels, Egyptian pyramids, fairytale grottoes, postmodern
boutiques _ or just elegant little houses. They have marble steps,
wrought-iron doors, appointed interiors. There are marble Saviours
and Madonnas and sculptures of the departed and their pets.
</P>
<P>
   The city skyline gives way to palm trees and cypresses, crosses
and steeples, busts and domes, great stone angels reaching to
heaven. The mausoleums can cost the earth. And the earth they are
on, occupied by generations of the high-born departed, is the
scarcest _ and costliest _ land in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Recoleta Cemetery is one of the world's extraordinary
graveyards, a study in architecture and sculpture, a country's
history, mores and soul. A number of tombs are national historic
monuments. It is a place of spiritual beauty and extravagant taste.
And thanks to Madonna and Broadway, it is hotter than ever as a
tourist attraction. Travelers stream through the portal, cameras in
hand, and ask the custodians the way to ``Evita.'' Some even ask
for ``Madonna.''
</P>
<P>
   Evita's tomb says ``Familia Duarte,'' her maiden name, and _
with a simple black facade on a narrow side street _ is nothing
special by Recoleta standards. The masses of flowers, however, the
crowds of visitors and the fact that she is there in the first
place _ surrounded by the rich she despised and who despised her _
are ironic.
</P>
<P>
   In this enclave of wealth, with tomb inscriptions from national
banks and the elite Jockey Club, the plaques to Evita are from the
Buenos Aires Taxi Drivers Union or the General Confederation of
Labor, an umbrella organization of unions. The inscription in
Spanish on the latter plaque ends with her battle cry, first used
by Spartacus in leading a slave revolt against the Romans:
</P>
<P>
   `` ... I keep the hope for glory,
</P>
<P>
   I wish only to serve
</P>
<P>
   The humble and the workers''
</P>
<P>
   I will come back and I will be millions ... !
</P>
<P>
   On a given Monday there are three huge floral arrangements at
her tomb. Carnations, roses and fuchsia are stuck in the door
wherever there's space. Fourteen people are crowded three deep,
most of them tourists, posing for photos in front of the plaques,
discussing why they are there.
</P>
<P>
   A curator from Bilbao: ``I visit cemeteries. In Paris I go to
see Oscar Wilde. Here I came to see Domingo Sarmiento, one of the
fathers of the country, and Eva Peron, who worked for the poorest
of the country. She was a myth who overshadowed Peron.''
</P>
<P>
   A tourist from Dallas: ``I saw the musical five times in Los
Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   A British Airways flight attendant: ``Argentina's not Argentina
without Eva Peron, is it? And I thought Madonna, the actress who
portrayed her, should have won an award from the Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   And, on a quiet weekday morning, away from the fray, an old
woman with no teeth and holes in her shoes stops at the tomb,
touches Evita's face on a plaque, deposits a bunch of daisies and
prays.
</P>
<P>
   Evita aside, the main attractions of Recoleta are the
architecture, the grandiose aura, the sense of rubbing shoulders
with Argentine history. The cemetery, inaugurated in 1822 and
redesigned in 1881, encompasses 13.5 acres. The departed include
Argentine presidents and vice presidents, governors, generals,
admirals, industrialists, publishers, judges, doctors, professors,
writers, poets, scientists _ and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them _ Alvear, Dorrego, Pueyrredon _ are familiar from
the Buenos Aires streets and plazas that bear their names. Others,
such as Jose Estrada, are known from the Literature of Argentina
shelves in bookshops. Still others, such as Dufour, Barchiesi,
O'Shea, Zoltowska or Breitman, reflect the many facets of Argentine
society.
</P>
<P>
   The labyrinthine necropolis is laid out like a town. There is no
map and only one sign _ to Mausoleo Sarmiento, a soaring obelisk
crowned with a condor. It commemorates Argentine hero Domingo
Faustino Sarmiento, president, writer and educator, who died Sept.
11, 1888.
</P>
<P>
   A tour, given infrequently, stops at other notable tombs. But
the best plan is to wander around, most effectively on a winter day
with a drizzle. The predominant color is gray.
</P>
<P>
   The entrance is post-colonial in style with four columns, a
peristyle and tall wrought-iron gates. Just inside is the main
avenue, an address of choice lined with cypress trees, stone
benches and some 50 showpiece mausoleums. A towering bronze statue
of El Redentor, The Redeemer, is in the center.
</P>
<P>
   Along the avenue visitors admire the white marble beauty of Luz
Maria Garcia Velloso in a softly draped dress, lying asleep among
sculptured roses on a white marble sarcophagus. A bronze ship atop
a green column celebrates Adm. Guillermo Brown, who gave ``days of
glory and triumph in the year 1814.'' His neighbor, Gen. Tomas
Guido, is buried in a little stone grotto.
</P>
<P>
   To turn left at The Redeemer, or right for that matter, is to
gradually absorb the life of the cemetery. The earliest graves _
one or two predating 1822 _ are simple, unadorned sepulchers, some
with a cross. After 1822 there are changing architectural styles.
Nineteenth-century neoclassical tombs favor angels and urns, Doric,
Ionic and Corinthian columns.
</P>
<P>
   The fin-de-siecle and early 20th-century porteno taste for
things European extended from the streets of the city to the plots
of the cemetery. Materials and architects were imported from Europe
to create increasingly sumptuous monuments.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920 Herlitzka tomb, for example, features Murano glass,
gold leaf and an altar of Italian marble. There were crazes for Art
Nouveau, Art Deco, the neo-Gothic.
</P>
<P>
   Personal tastes and predilections were also expressed. The 1903
Rufina Cambaceres tomb features giant sculptured Art Nouveau
orchids and a soulful statue of the young woman. The Herrera-Noble
mausoleum, a brown tinted-glass block, is a study in modern design.
The tomb of Adolfo Casal has a stone coffin on top of its roof.
</P>
<P>
   The family pantheon of Dorrego-Ortiz Basualdo (1849-1920) is
possibly the graveyard's most priceless structure. Rich in stained
glass, Italian sculpture and symbolism, it features a virgin
lighting a tall seven-branched candelabrum, symbol of spiritual
light and salvation.
</P>
<P>
   A dolorosa by the Milanese sculptor Antonio Tantardini, whose
work is also in the Buenos Aires Museo Nacional de Bellas Artes,
adorns the tomb of Juan Facundo Quiroga (1788-1835), the
assassinated gaucho caudillo or war chief known as the Tiger of the
Plains.
</P>
<P>
   And the words of a heartbroken father, engraved on the tomb of
his daughter, speak of the sadness of untimely death. Beneath a
green bronze statue of Liliana Crociati de Szaszak (1944-1970), her
hand on the head of her dog Sabu, there is a poem in Italian. It
begins:
</P>
<P>
   To My Daughter
</P>
<P>
   Alone I ask myself, why
</P>
<P>
   You are gone and my heart
</P>
<P>
   Which only wanted you
</P>
<P>
   Is destroyed, why?
</P>
<P>
   Why? Only destiny knows,
</P>
<P>
   Why, I ask myself, why?
</P>
<P>
   It is signed ``Your papa.''
</P>
<P>
   In every graveyard there is a story behind every grave. In
Recoleta the stories are those of a nation, and there are some good
ones. In 1828 Gen. Juan Lavalle ordered the execution of Gen.
Manuel Dorrego, now his neighbor in death.
</P>
<P>
   In the biography of Juan Facundo Quiroga by Sarmiento,
``Facundo: Civilization and Barbarism,'' the author portrayed
Quiroga as a barbarian. Now they, too, are posthumous neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The most astonishing story is the attempted Aramburu-Evita
cadaver exchange. When Eva Peron died, at age 33 in 1952, her body
was embalmed and kept in the General Confederation of Labor
headquarters. Gen. Pedro E. Aramburu, a political enemy of the
Perons who was de facto president of the junta that ruled
Argentina, ordered the kidnapping of her corpse, which was sent in
secret to a cemetery in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The Montoneros, a guerrilla group of Peronist loyalists,
abducted and executed Aramburu, then kept his remains as ransom for
the return of ``Companera'' Evita's. The police recovered
Aramburu's body. But when Evita's body didn't show up, the
Montoneros later robbed Aramburu's grave.
</P>
<P>
   Evita's mummy was eventually sent to Juan Peron in exile in
Madrid and later returned to Buenos Aires, restored, and nearly 25
years after her death, in 1976, buried a few blocks from Aramburu.
Juan Peron is buried in Cementerio de la Chacarita, a more populist
cemetery in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But Recoleta is not only a story of past power and glory. It is
a place that is part of Buenos Aires everyday life. Cemetery
custodians polish marble, cradle cats, chat on tomb steps and may
open tomb doors for travelers who want to see an interior. (A tip
is always welcome, but not mandatory.)
</P>
<P>
   Many tombs are lovingly personal, with interiors _ visible
through windows or doors _ adorned with symbolic objects and
mementoes: exquisite lace cloths over a coffin, a cross encrusted
with gems. Behind one wrought-iron door there is a broken chair of
carved wood and cane. Inside another there is a black-and-white
photograph of a beautiful woman in a white feather boa.
</P>
<P>
   Family, friends, admirers, patriots, visit faithfully. There's
usually someone around, and the cemetery is especially busy on
weekends. Visitors replenish flowers in vases, polish silver
handles on coffins, leave messages, sit and reflect.
</P>
<P>
   On a winter Sunday, a woman with short gray hair wearing
sunglasses and a mink coat sits, hands clasped, before the opened
door of a doctor's tomb. A very old man with white hair, in a
waterproof jacket and brown woolen scarf, trudges slowly through
the streets with a bunch of white carnations and violets. He stops
at a white marble tomb, unwraps the flowers, arranges them one by
one on the tomb, folds the paper and crosses himself.
</P>
<P>
   And there are funerals _ often near-state occasions _ when a
tomb is opened to reveal subterranean steps and layers of coffins.
Twelve years ago during a first, uninitiated, visit to Recoleta, I
saw a procession of people filing in. Thinking it was a tour, I had
the idea of joining in until it became clear that it was a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the newspaper reported: ``The remains of
58-year-old Radical Party leader Jorge Roulet, who died from a
heart attack on Friday while at his country residence at Villa
Elisa, were interred yesterday at the Recoleta cemetery ... ''
</P>
<P>
   There was a front-page photograph of President Raul Alfonsin
conveying condolences to the widow, Elba Barreiro Roulet, the vice
governor of the province of Buenos Aires. I had a sense of having
come close to the Recoleta elite.
</P>
<P>
   Recoleta Cemetery, on the Calle Junin across from the Plaza del
Pilar, is open 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Guided free tours are on the last Sunday of each month, from
March to November only; groups meet at 2:30 p.m. at the peristyle.
</P>
<P>
   To find Eva Peron's tomb, turn left at the Riccheri tomb on the
main avenue, walk past the de Yturriaca tomb, turn right at the
Yturraspe tomb, walk three blocks and turn left; it's about halfway
down the block.

   In Buenos Aires the elegant neighborhood of Recoleta is the
fashionable place to stay, to while away hours in cafes and
museums, to walk the poodles in the park. And when it's all over,
it's the place to end up.
</P>
<P>
   Across the grassy way from the outdoor cafes, a great white

Joshua Tree National Park look like enormous dollops of meringue
browning in the desert sunshine. I'm driving to Turtle Rock, in
late November, for the first day of a weekend rock-climbing course
for beginners, and with great anticipation I realize that by day's
end I will be climbing these seemingly smooth, soft-edged outcrops.
</P>
<P>
   In my imagination I have a natural affinity for rock climbing;
I'll ascend agile as a monkey but still take time to notice the
subtle colorations and the way wind and water have shaped the
granite. A two-day meditation on the nature of rock is the way I
see it.
</P>
<P>
   Joshua Tree National Park, situated three hours east of Los
Angeles, encompasses parts of both the Mojave Desert, higher in
altitude, and the lower, hotter Colorado Desert. It is in the
Mojave section of the park that, over 100 million years ago, these
jumbled piles of bedrock cooled and hardened many miles beneath the
surface of the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Millenniums of erosion by ground water weathered the granite,
often into fantastic shapes, while flash floods washed away the
protective ground surface to reveal them.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gerberding from the Joshua Tree Rock Climbing School is
our instructor. He's an easygoing man who's been climbing for 21
years and has done 84 ascents of El Capitan in Yosemite, a fact
that draws a stunned look of admiration from 19-year-old Jake, the
youngest in our group of four beginners. The rest of us, myself and
a couple from San Francisco, are in our mid '30s to early '40s.
</P>
<P>
   After fitting us with smooth rubber-soled climbing shoes, Steve
leads us to a boulder-strewn area where we will learn about balance
and practice footwork, all vital to building confidence for the
bigger climbs. No ropes, no pitons, just us and our shoes (Steve
tells us they're designed to ``stick'' to rock) moving across the
boulders like human flies. Initially I keep slipping, but after an
hour of working to keep my weight over my hips and keep my heels
down, I have moments when I feel as though I have suction cups on
my feet.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest of the morning we learn how to tie into our
climbing harnesses and how to use the climber's safety system
called belaying.
</P>
<P>
   Before any of us climb, we will tie onto a long rope that loops
up through the top anchor point and then back down. Tied onto the
other end of the rope is our belayer, who is attached to a ground
anchor, a rock or a tree, and who will gather in the rope's slack
as we ascend. If we lose our footing our belayer will be able to
hold the rope taut with relative ease, thus braking the fall. The
belayer will also lower us down the rock for the descent.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch Steve leads us to a lumpy outcrop of rock where a
brightly colored rope disappears over a ledge 30 feet above. I
nervously tie in first and begin to climb. The shoes are sticking
great and I move cautiously over the bumps and curves in the gray
granite. It's like climbing a colossal sleeping elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Forty feet up I hoist myself over another large ledge and,
feeling as though I've conquered Everest, I touch the anchor point.
Then comes the moment of faith. I call for tension, and once my
belayer has taken in all the slack, I lean back, giving my weight
to the rope. As my belayer feeds the rope back out I walk backward
down the rock face.
</P>
<P>
   Rock climbing is a breeze, I think, until the next climb up a
gritty, gnarled section of rock. We're learning a technique called
lay backing, a way of taking advantage of any long vertical cracks
in the rock. In essence you grip one side of the crack and pull
with your hands while pushing with your feet, creating a tension
that enables you to seemingly defy gravity and ascend sideways up
the crack.
</P>
<P>
   When I attempt it I realize how little upper-body strength I
have. The granite is rough and whenever I jam my hand into the
crack, I feel as though I'm being bitten by the rock. Cheered on by
my fellow climbers, I finally claw my way to the top, where I
manage to somehow wedge my legs into the fissure to prevent myself
from falling.
</P>
<P>
   I'm bone weary when, at day's end, I drive back to my motel in
the nearby town of Twentynine Palms. There's an eerie twilight
beauty to the landscape; the pale sand glowing, the granite
outcrops like pieces of the moon fallen to earth. After Day 1 of
Basic Rock the only thing I've learned about the nature of rock is
that it is hard _ rock hard.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible I have no affinity for rock climbing, I
think while driving back into the park early on Sunday morning.
Then the beauty of those bizarre granite outcrops distracts me from
my nerves.
</P>
<P>
   Today they look fleshy, thickly contoured like the massive
bodies in Lucien Freud paintings. We're climbing in beautiful Echo
Cove, and Steve sets up four routes: two hard ones for Jake and two
easier ones that are confidence builders for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty feet up the easiest route, I decide that the words ``rock
climbing'' do not adequately describe the activity I've been
engaged in since late the previous afternoon. Rock scaling and
clutching and grasping, rock balancing and wrestling and groping
seem more appropriate. Now, panting more from stress than fatigue,
I'm on the verge of rock surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest up,'' Steve shouts. ``Enjoy the view.'' With wobbly legs
I perch on a small ledge. The sandy floor of Echo Cove is dotted
with Joshua trees. Legend has it that these trees, which are
members of the Yucca family and only grow above 3,000 feet in
altitude, were named by the Mormons when they crossed the Mojave
Desert in the 1850s, the outstretched branches reminding them of
the prophet Joshua who would guide them westward.
</P>
<P>
   Sufficiently calmed, I get back to the business at hand. This is
a friction climb, meaning there are no obvious hand or foot holds _
rather, I'm searching the rock face for ``smearable surfaces,''
shallow depressions in which to place my feet. With small,
concentrated moves I cover 20 more feet. But now the angle of the
rock face is growing steeper, it feels like it's almost 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Rock paralysis kicks in. Surely if I move another inch I will
fall; in fact I start to wonder how I'm even managing to stay put.
Fear mounts and I break the cardinal rule of friction climbing. I
lean in and try to cling to the smooth expanse of rock, shifting
all my weight off my heels. Sure enough I fall _ all of 12 inches.
My belayer has me on a short rope and I dangle for a moment,
searching for the next smearable surface. Which I eventually find,
and, trusting my feet, I make it to the top. Another Everest
conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you like rock climbing so much?'' I ask Steve when I'm
back on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun,'' he replies, a slightly incredulous look on his
face, as if he can't fathom why I would ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean by `fun'?'' I demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puzzle solving,'' he says, explaining how creative and
satisfying it is to find the sometimes elusive path up a rock face.
</P>
<P>
   Gently he coaxes me onto the next route, another friction climb.
It is steeper and more challenging than the first and yet I ascend
with more confidence. I'm starting to see a pattern _ each climb
has had moments of panic and doubt, followed by a huge sense of
accomplishment when I reach the top.
</P>
<P>
   But fun? I'm still not convinced until the climb before lunch.
Mark from San Francisco goes up first and returns with a big smile
on his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrific,'' he says. ``Great hand and foot holds.'' But I
don't know whether to believe a man who has almost scraped his
fingertips raw. I make it 15 feet up the craggy 50-foot route
before my puzzle-solving skills vanish. I have no idea where to
move.
</P>
<P>
   Steve shouts that there's a good foot hold about four feet to my
left and I reach for a carbuncle of rock no larger than a new
potato. I climb on and in an odd way I begin to feel like I'm doing
a dance on this granite outcrop. It's an utterly graceless affair
on my part; sometimes I stretch like a starfish, other times I
dangle from narrow ledges. I wrap my body around rock and use every
bump and crevice to help me reach the top.
</P>
<P>
   During my descent I pay attention to the curves and contours and
coloration of the granite I've been so intimate with. A dark
reddish smear catches my eye, and I look closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a bloodstain up here,'' I yell. It must be mine I
think, taking a quick look at my bloodied knuckles. I, too, have
left my mark on this rock. It's a mad, giddy moment of triumph and
I'm laughing wildly. Don't ask me why, but suddenly rock climbing
feels like fun.

Calif. 92252, (800) 890-4745, fax (760) 366-9315, is just outside
the park entrance, about three hours from Los Angeles. It offers
courses year round. There are one-day, weekend and four-day courses
for beginner and intermediate climbers, as well as private guiding.
</P>
<P>
   During July and August, when the desert is too hot, courses are
at Suicide and Tahquitz Rocks near Idyllwild, above Palm Springs,
Calif. Prices range from $75 for a day's climbing, to $145 for the
Basic Rock weekend (which I took), to $295 for a four-day
intermediate seminar.
</P>
<P>
   The prettiest and most charming place to stay is the 29 Palms
Inn, 73950 Inn Avenue, Twentynine Palms, Calif. 92277; (760)
367-3505, fax (760) 367-4425. Each of the small adobe desert
bungalows has its own simple sun patio and fireplace. The inn is
situated on the oasis of Mara and has wonderful birdlife, a pool, a
hot tub and a good restaurant. Double rates for the bungalows start
at $103 for weekend nights.
</P>
<P>
   Because the inn was fully booked, I stayed at the Best Western
Gardens Inn and Suites, 71487 Twentynine Palms Highway, Twentynine
Palms, Calif. 92277; (760) 367-9141, fax (760) 367-2584. My huge
deluxe room with a whirlpool (it sounded like a cement mixer but
did wonders for aching muscles) normally costs $114, although I
received a discounted rate of $70; standard rooms start at $74.

 &HT;    A 'cowsmic' view of types of government
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ In the interests of fostering knowledge,
I'm passing along a bovine encyclopedia of how the various
governmental systems work. A friend sent it to me. Call it a
cowsmic view of world organization. Here goes:
</P>
<P>
   FEUDALISM: You have two cows. Your lord takes some of the milk.
</P>
<P>
   PURE SOCIALISM: You have two cows. The government takes them and
puts them in a barn with everyone else's cows. You have to take
care of all the cows. The government gives you as much milk as you
need.
</P>
<P>
   BUREAUCRATIC SOCIALISM: You have two cows. The government takes
them and puts them in a barn with everyone else's cows. They are
cared for by ex-chicken farmers. You have to take care of the
chickens the government took from the chicken farmers. The
government gives you as much milk and as many eggs as the
regulations say you should need.
</P>
<P>
   FASCISM: You have two cows. The government takes both, hires you
to take care of them, and sells you the milk.
</P>
<P>
   PURE COMMUNISM: You have two cows. Your neighbors help you take
care of them, and you all share the milk.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIAN COMMUNISM: You have two cows. You have to take care of
them, but the government takes all the milk.
</P>
<P>
   DICTATORSHIP: You have two cows. The government takes both and
shoots you.
</P>
<P>
   SINGAPORE DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. The government fines you
for keeping two unlicensed animals in an apartment.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARISM: You have two cows. The government takes both and
drafts you.
</P>
<P>
   PURE DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. Your neighbors decide who
gets the milk.
</P>
<P>
   REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. Your neighbors pick
someone to tell you who gets the milk.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN DEMOCRACY: The government promises to give you two cows
if you vote for it. After the election, the president is impeached
for speculating in cow futures. The press dubs the affair
``Cowgate.''
</P>
<P>
   BRITISH DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. You feed them sheep's
brains and they go mad. The government doesn't do anything.
</P>
<P>
   BUREAUCRACY: You have two cows. At first the government
regulates what you can feed them and when you can milk them. Then
it pays you not to milk them. After that it takes both, shoots one,
milks the other and pours the milk down the drain. Then it requires
you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.
</P>
<P>
   ANARCHY: You have two cows. Either you sell the milk at a fair
price or your neighbors kill you and take the cows.
</P>
<P>
   CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell one and buy a bull.
</P>
<P>
   HONG KONG CAPITALISM: You have two cows. You sell three of them
to your publicly listed company, using letters of credit opened by
your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap
with associated general offer so that you get all four cows back,
with a tax deduction for keeping five cows. The milk rights of six
cows are transferred via a Panamanian intermediary to a Cayman
Islands company secretly owned by the majority shareholder, who
sells the rights to all seven cows' milk back to the listed
company. The annual report says that the company owns eight cows,
with an option on one more. Meanwhile, you kill the two cows
because the Feng Shui is bad.
</P>
<P>
   ENVIRONMENTALISM: You have two cows. The government bans you
from milking or killing them.
</P>
<P>
   FEMINISM: You have two cows. They get married and adopt a veal
calf.
</P>
<P>
   TOTALITARIANISM: You have two cows. The government takes them
and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL CORRECTNESS: You are associated with (the concept of
``ownership'' is a symbol of the phallo-centric, war-mongering,
intolerant past) two differently-aged (but no less valuable to
society) bovines of nonspecified gender.
</P>
<P>
   COUNTER CULTURE: Wow, dude, there's like... these two cows, man.
You got to have some of this milk. Far out! Awesome!
</P>
<P>
   SURREALISM: You have two giraffes. The government requires you
to take harmonica lessons.
</P>
<P>
   JAPANESE DEMOCRACY: You have two cows. You give the milk to
gangsters so they don't ask any awkward questions about who you're
giving the milk to.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPEAN FEDERALISM: You have two cows, which cost too much
money to care for because everybody is buying milk imported from
some cheap east-European country and would never pay the fortune
you'd have to ask for your cows' milk. So you apply for financial
aid from the European Union to subsidize your cows and are granted
enough subsidies. You then sell your milk at the former elevated
price to some government-owned distributor, which then dumps your
milk onto the market at east-European prices to make Europe
competitive. You spend the money you got as a subsidy on two new
cows and then go on a demonstration to Brussels, complaining that
the European farm-policy is going to drive you out of your job.

   Now you know.

 &HT;    Postage stamp column prompts letters
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ Letters, I get letters...
</P>
<P>
   A recent column on my misadventures at the post office prompted
some quick responses.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Arthur Logan of Cincinnati, Ohio, writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a life! You don't have enough wit to be a Dave Barry, so
stick to editing as opposed to writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You obviously don't have the mental muscle of the financial
side of your business because you don't understand the great
benefit of controlling costs, saving consumers money and still
making a profit as the post office is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're doing a great job of destroying the trust the American
public has in newspapers. Your type of arrogance will lead to the
demise of another newspaper and no one will be the wiser.''
</P>
<P>
   DBuis1055(at)aol.com E-mails:
</P>
<P>
   ``As a postal worker myself, I hear a lot of comments like yours
from other customers. I sometimes wish we had competition on the
first class monopoly so people like you could go somewhere else!
Maybe that's what you want?''
</P>
<P>
   And on a happier note, Mr. Joseph E. Caldwell of Charlotte, N.C.
writes:
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewinsky talks constructive''
</P>
<P>
   ``Olympic panel expels 6 members''
</P>
<P>
   ``S. African violence escalates''
</P>
<P>
   ``Girl, 16, to fight on front lines''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yikes and good grief! Why, oh why do I buy the newspaper?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well _ 'Zits,' two local dudes in the paper, Doug Robanchek
and Tommy Tomlinson, and the all-too-rare little story like yours
today in the Observer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the post office for some one-cents but they were
out, so I blithely put on two 32s per envelope. Things like
mortgage, electric, cable, etc. gotta be paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I'm but 55, I recall my folks talking in 1947 or so
about rationing in WWII. Hmm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never been to Lufkin. Back in '85 a gal and I left Charlotte
on a sort of Jack Kerouac 'On the Road' thing. I-40 to Flagstaff.
Back to Santa Rosa, then through Lubbock, Abilene, Shreveport and
New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, Y'all got a big state.''
</P>
<P>
   For better or worse, thanks to all who wrote. And Mr. Caldwell,
if you ever do get to Lufkin, look me up at the paper. I'll be in
the newsroom, not the accounting department.

 &HT;    Despite Germany's efforts, Jewish travelers not interested in
visiting
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sam Hamill and his wife Estelle are
taking a three-week tour of Eastern Europe this summer: Poland,
Austria, Hungary and a host of other countries. Germany, Estelle
says, as if stating the obvious, will not be among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not interested,'' the suburban Boynton Beach woman says,
waving her hand dismissively. ``There's plenty of other places that
I'd rather go.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, the German government says, is an attitude it would
like to change.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a century after the Third Reich tried to
annihilate Jewish people, shiny brochures filled with smiling
countrymen and bucolic landscapes printed by the German National
Tourist Board are inviting them back.
</P>
<P>
   A 36-page pamphlet called ``Germany for the Jewish Traveler'' is
the first public relations tool of its kind put out by the German
government. An expanded version is planned next year.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike general tourism brochures, many of which make no mention
of the war or the Holocaust, ``Germany for the Jewish Traveler''
deals with it head-on. The brochure calls the history of the
Rhineland ``ruthless'' and ``unparalleled in human history'' while
tracing regional anti-Semitism back to the 12th century.
</P>
<P>
   But the apology-cum-invitation hasn't had the desired effect so
far, tourism experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Gilbert, a travel agent who specializes in Jewish tourism
and who last week received an unsolicited copy of Deutschland
Magazine from the German government, said there has not been so
much as a ripple of interest among her Jewish clientele.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may be trying to create something, but so far I haven't
had a single inquiry,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Employees of Isram Travel in New York, one of the largest
operators of European tours in the United States, say trips
centered on ethnicity and heritage in Eastern Europe have steadily
increased since perestroika opened the region a decade ago. But for
Jews, that has not carried over to Germany. A first-of-its-kind
trip marketed toward American Jews and focusing on Jewish history
in Berlin offered last year was canceled because enough people
didn't sign up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no interest,'' said Eileen Hart, the company's vice
president of marketing. ``And it's like anything else, we need to
offer trips that sell.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of interest here, there is a tremendous amount
of state-sponsored emphasis on Jewish history and culture in
Germany. Most major cities have Jewish war memorials and museums,
guide books point out. And Germany is home to one of the
fastest-growing Jewish communities in Europe. Though only 6,000 of
the country's pre-war Jewish population of 400,000 survived the
war, about 70,000 Jews, many emigres from the former Soviet Union,
have since moved there.
</P>
<P>
   That immigration is partly motivated by the declining Russian
economy, but it also has roots in the German government's intense
effort to make amends for its past. Since 1951 more than $60
billion in restitution has been paid to Jews and the nation of
Israel, according to Hannelore Kohler, an officer at the German
Information Center in New York. A high school exchange program
between Germany and Israel has been going on for years and nearly
120,000 Germans travel to Israel annually.
</P>
<P>
   The sheer number of publicly supported memorials to victims of
the Holocaust and the once-thriving German Jewish community is
impressive. In Berlin alone, there is a Jewish Department of the
Berlin Museum, a Holocaust exhibit titled ``Topography of Terror''
and a new Berlin Jewish Museum under construction. A national
Holocaust memorial is being debated.
</P>
<P>
   Not far away is the Wives of Jewish Husbands memorial, dedicated
to the hundreds of non-Jewish women who successfully protested the
arrest of their Jewish husbands in 1943; a German resistance
memorial marking where two Nazi generals plotted to kill Hitler;
and a Walter Rathenau Memorial, dedicated to a German Jew who was
appointed foreign minister in 1922 and later assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   The nearby Wannsee Villa, where the Holocaust was engineered in
January 1942, is also now a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Leonid Feldman of Temple Emanu-El in Palm Beach said he
has been approached by members of his congregation to travel to
Eastern Europe and he would like to include Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is obviously going to be an emotional issue for some
people,'' Feldman said. ``But I think we have to be frank _ the
fact is Germany has done an amazing job cleaning up their act and
being a very close friend to the Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, any sea change in attitudes may take another generation.
The feelings of American Jews, especially older Jews, remain
largely rooted in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the outskirts of the country once,'' said Sonya
Cornell, a grandmother who lives in Delray Beach. ``And I felt very
uncomfortable. You can feel the history in the air. They are mean
people. They are a cruel people, I can't get over that.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another side to that loathing. Helga Brenner-Kahn, of
the German Tourism Board in New York, said the catalyst for the New
York-produced brochure _ as well as ``From Horror to Hope,''
printed by the German Information Center _ was the number of
questions her office fields about German-Jewish history from
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jewish Traveler brochure _ of which 10,000
English-language copies were printed _ marks an about-face in the
way the tourism board has dealt with the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1992 brochure called ``Today's Germany,'' the third page
contains a section titled ``A Country with a Great History.'' In a
single page the history of Germany is outlined from the Saxons and
Bavarians right up to the unification of East and West Germany.
Neither Hitler nor the Holocaust is mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was rushed,'' Brenner-Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The board's more forthright attitude has extended to public
relations efforts for recent events such as this year's celebration
of the 250th birthday of the poet Goethe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you in the press releases about Goethe's
birthplaces, we made it a point to mention Buchenwald, which is
very near.''

   OHIO-BOOKBEAT _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Like everyone who needs to write
fiction, Frank Dobson wanted more than to tell a tale. He sought to

He had a story, born of a real incident back in the '80s. ``I got

 &HT;    It just goes to show that you can't never tell
 &HT;    By Jay Milner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ The headline over the New York World's review of
the brand new novel April 12, 1925, was: ``F. Scott Fitzgerald's
Latest a Dud.''
</P>
<P>
   The novel was ``The Great Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days late a book reviewer named Isabel Patterson wrote in
the New York Herald Tribune that ``The Great Gatsby'' was ``neither
profound nor durable.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the reputedly brilliant H.L. Mencken called ``The Great
Gatsby'' ``not more than a glorified anecdote, and not too probable
at that.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on and on. There were a few reviewers who praised the
short novel by the young Fitzgerald, but they apparently were in
the minority, and their praise was light.
</P>
<P>
   I found those and other reviews of Fitzgerald's 1925 classic in
an old (1971) paperback edition of ``In His Time,'' a collection of
essays, letters, reviews and other pieces by and about Fitzgerald
and his work. It proved once again, as my wife likes to point out
from time to time, ``that you can't never tell.''
</P>
<P>
   So, 75 years later, the 100 best American books of the century
are chosen by a distinguished panel and No. 2 on the list is none
other than Fitzgerald's ``The Great Gatsby.''
</P>
<P>
   What does this prove about reviewers, then and now? I'm not sure
I know. It might be that those 1925 reviewers, including the
brilliant H.L. Mencken, were too close to the time to see that
Fitzgerald's short novel was, and is, the story of America. I'm not
even sure Fitzgerald himself was aware of this when he wrote it.
I'd guess he didn't, that he was just writing what he saw and heard
and he had a discerning eye and ear.
</P>
<P>
   Mencken, in his rather detailed rant against the book, wrote:
``The theme is the old one of a romantic and preposterous love _
the ancient fidelis ad urnum motif reduced to a macabre humor. The
principal personage is a bounder typical of those parts _ a fellow
who seems to know everyone and yet remains unknown to all _ a young
man with a great deal of mysterious money, the tastes of a movie
actor and, under it all, the simple sentimentality of a somewhat
sclerotic fat woman....
</P>
<P>
   ``This clown Fitzgerald rushes to his death in nine short
chapters. The other performers in the Totentanz are of a like, or
even worse quality... ``
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is obviously unimportant,'' Mencken continued,
``...it is certainly not to be put on the same shelf with, say, ``
'This Side of Paradise.' `` And so on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Makes me wonder about my own ``reviews.'' I don't even know what
fidelis ad urnum means, not to mention what a ``sclerotic fat
woman'' looks like. You see, ``The Great Gatsby'' is, in my
unhumble opinion, one of the best American novels ever written. Do
I, therefore, know what I'm talking about?
</P>
<P>
   Oh yes, here's an item: ``James Joyce's 'Ulysses' was voted the
most essential classic novel for the next 100 years by 47 critics
and writers polled by the British bookseller Waterstones. Second
was Fitzgerald's 'The Great Gatsby', followed by Proust's
'Remembrance of Things Past.' ``
</P>
<P>
   To quote one of my best friends, ``that just goes to show you
can't never tell.''

THE SLATE 60: PHILANTHROPY REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  By JODIE T. ALLEN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charity in this country is going to the dogs. Cats too. We say
that literally, not figuratively. Claiming the No. 3 position on
this year's ``Slate 60'' list of the nation's top donors is a $200
million pledge by David and Cheryl Duffield to assist local humane
societies and animal shelters in finding homes for every stray or
abandoned dog and cat in America.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a good year only for our furry friends. This
year's top givers (there are 65, given ties for last place), many
the beneficiaries of a vibrant if erratic stock market, gave a
total of $3.7 billion to tax-deductible causes. That's not much
above 1997's total of more than $3.1 billion, but last year's sum
was swollen by Slate 60 inspirer Ted Turner's pledge of $1 billion
to create a foundation to support U.N.-related causes. (We probably
shouldn't have credited Turner with the full amount, as it turns
out he is transferring it in annual increments. But we compensated
by not giving him credit for this year's $100 million tranche,
though the CNN founder still makes the list at No. 32 for his $27
million in other 1998 donations.)
</P>
<P>
   And it compares favorably with the mere $1.3 billion total for
the 1996 Slate 60. Moreover, it took a $15 million gift to make
this year's cut, whereas in 1997 a piddling $10 million sufficed.
Similarly, we've restricted the 1998 ``Honorable Mentions'' list to
donors of $5 million or more, compared with $1 million in earlier
years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 list is led by James and Virginia Stowers, whose $327
million contribution will create a medical research institute in
Kansas City, Mo. (James Stowers built one of the nation's largest
families of no-load mutual funds.)
</P>
<P>
   Next in line is Martha Ingram, who donated to Vanderbilt
University $300 million worth of stock in Ingram Micro, the world's
largest wholesale distributor of technology products and services,
of which she is a director.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of other donations on the Slate 60, compiled for us
once again by philanthropy maven Ann Castle, follow in the
Stowers-Ingram pattern. Colleges and universities are the most
frequent beneficiaries. Usually the donors are grateful alums, but
there are exceptions. The Joseph and Phyllis Mailman family (No.
28) gave a hefty $33 million to Columbia University's School of
Public Health, though no family member has attended Columbia. And
Robert McDonough (No. 30), who made his fortune from a
temporary-worker business, gave $30 million to Georgetown
University's business school, though his contact with the school
was limited to evening classes at the Jesuit college's School of
Foreign Service while he was working the midnight shift as a U.S.
Capitol policeman in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Some philanthropists looked beyond the ivy-covered walls to find
unmet needs in neighborhoods and downtowns. Joan Kroc (No. 9), the
philanthropically imaginative widow of McDonald's founder Ray Kroc,
gave $80 million--of a total of $105 million in 1998 donations--to
the Salvation Army to build and operate a community center for all
ages in a depressed area of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Madison, Wis., received $50 million from Jerry Frautschi (tied
at No. 16) to develop a downtown cultural district. Walter and
Leonore Annenberg (tied at No. 36) earmarked $10 million of their
$25 million in donations for Philadelphia's Independence Mall to
upgrade it into a major tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel and Merlene Phillips (tied at No. 36) pledged $25 million
to the Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs of America. Robert and Janice McNair's
$22 million (No. 46) will give a big boost to the South Carolina
Aquarium. ``We know that every child is a precious resource who
deserves a good education,'' the McNairs said. ``But schools cannot
do the job alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools, however, especially schools for disadvantaged
children, also drew a welcome chunk of this year's largess. Ted
Forstmann and John Walton (tied at No. 16) each gave $50 million
for a scholarship program to help more than 50,000 public school
children around the country attend private schools.
</P>
<P>
   Mary and Robert Pew (tied at No. 36) gave $25 million to a fund
to improve public education for economically disadvantaged children
in Florida's Palm Beach and Martin counties, while Donald and Doris
Fisher's $25 million (tied at No. 36) went to the Edison Project to
create alternative public schools. Gerard and Lilo Leeds (No. 47)
added $21 million to previous gifts to an institute they created
that helps likely school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of worthwhile causes to give money to--the
church, the hospitals, the museums,'' said Gerald Leeds. ``We think
education is primary. Education can change the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Collapsing currencies in Asia and Russia did not keep
international speculator George Soros (No. 26) from contributing
almost $39 million to various causes, (though that's far less than
the $530.5 million he gave in 1997), more than half of it to fund
Russia's impoverished public libraries.
</P>
<P>
   His brother Paul and Paul's wife Daisy (No. 45) chipped in
another $24 million, most of it for graduate education for
immigrants and their children. ``The big trend in this city [New
York] is putting your name on a building, which didn't appeal to my
husband,'' Daisy Soros told the New York Times. His monument will
have many progeny.
</P>
<P>
   Notably absent from this year's list are any ``celebrities,'' as
the term is commonly applied. Despite the vast fortunes accrued by
Hollywood and sports stars, none appears among the nation's top
givers. The vibrant world of high-tech does make a contribution.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Ingram, noted earlier, Bill and Melinda Gates and
Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen claim the No. 6 and No. 35
positions with total gifts of $189.57 million and $26 million,
respectively. These are distributed among a variety of educational,
environmental, and historical preservation causes.
</P>
<P>
   Intel co-founder Gordon Moore and his wife Betty (No. 20) gave
$47.5 million to Conservation International and to Cambridge
University to house the archives of physicist Stephen Hawking. And
high-tech financial media pioneer Michael Bloomberg's $45 million
gift to his alma mater, Johns Hopkins University (tied at No. 21),
will primarily aid undergraduates in the arts and sciences and in
engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the vast fortunes amassed by the moguls and munchkins of
the technology revolution go largely untapped. The residents of the
Pacific Northwest, despite their higher than average incomes, are
notably chintzy in their charity.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent article in the Wall Street Journal,
Washington and Oregon rank only No. 31 and No. 40, respectively,
among states in average contributions per resident. (Leading the
list are Wyoming, Utah, Tennessee, and Washington, D.C.--yes, the
nation's much maligned capital city.)
</P>
<P>
   The Philanthropy Promotion Initiative, coordinated by a group of
the Northwest region's foundations, aims to rectify that by mining
the humanitarian impulse buried in the hearts of high-techies. Go
for the gold!

KENNETH STARR FOR THE DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM SALETAN 
 (www.slate.com) 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There he goes again. According to ``associates'' interviewed
last week by the New York Times, Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
has been ``actively considering'' an indictment of President
Clinton while Clinton is still in office.
</P>
<P>
   The story, published Sunday, surfaces at a typically inopportune
moment. The Senate is preparing to vote by Feb. 12 on whether to
remove Clinton from office. Assuming that vote fails, senators will
evidently consider whether to censure Clinton or to approve
``findings of fact'' that he lied under oath and interfered with
the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's reappearance is just what Clinton needed to escape
punishment entirely.
</P>
<P>
   The leak is clearly an inside job. According to the Times,
Starr's ``associates,'' with whom he ``speaks frequently'' and
``has discussed'' the issue directly, have been researching the
issue and discussing it with Starr during the Senate trial. Starr
and his spokesman deny leaking the story.
</P>
<P>
   The most charitable theory is that it came from the ``group of
prosecutors'' inside Starr's office who, according to the Times,
believe Starr should seek the indictments. But by signaling that
Starr might prosecute Clinton in the courts, the disclosure from
Starr's office protects Clinton in the Senate in the following
ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ It supplies an alternative villain. Ever since James Carville
declared ``war'' a year ago, the White House strategy has been to
divert scrutiny to Starr, Newt Gingrich, and other enemies of
Clinton. In the past six months, the media and key congressional
Democrats have turned on Clinton twice, first when Starr
disappeared from the scene in September, and again when Gingrich
disappeared in November. By leaving Clinton alone onstage, his
enemies forced Congress and the press to confront his shameful
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Now, just as the Senate approaches its verdict on Clinton's
misdeeds, Starr's ``associates'' have shoved Starr back onstage,
and Democrats are turning the spotlight on him. Clinton's lawyer
David Kendall is calling for an investigation, claiming that Starr
``has once again engaged in illegal and partisan leaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the Times story was released, Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., declared on Meet the Press, ``Ken Starr is once again
running amok.'' On This Week, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., likened
Starr to the obsessed, wrongheaded investigator in The Fugitive.
Republican senators groaned at Starr's gaffe, citing it as further
evidence that the independent counsel law should be scrapped. The
discussion of Starr's indiscretion supplanted the discussion of
Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   _ It antagonizes the Senate. Democratic senators were already
angry at Starr for going to court to force Monica Lewinsky to
submit to yet another deposition, which she did for House
prosecutors Monday. These senators complained that Starr was
interfering with the Senate's management of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides lost no time turning the Times report into
another cause for Senate outrage. ``Starr is tampering with the
Senate trial,'' White House spokesman Jim Kennedy told the Los
Angeles Times Saturday night. ``Somebody ought to tell (Starr) he's
not the 101st senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic senators agreed. Sunday morning on Face the Nation,
Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich, grumbled that Starr ``or people in his
office are trying to impact this trial. They've tried to impact it
before in a number of ways, wrongfully, irresponsibly.'' The
suspicion that Starr is scheming to make the Senate punish Clinton
provides a convenient rationalization for doing the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   _ It gives Democrats a reason to oppose findings of fact.
Republicans have been floating a proposal under which the Senate,
rather than voting to remove Clinton from office, would approve a
resolution affirming that Clinton lied under oath and tampered
improperly with the judicial system.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats have indicated they might support such a
resolution, depending on its language. But the specter of a
criminal indictment by Starr stirs up suspicion among Democrats
that these findings of fact might help Starr prosecute Clinton on
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. This suspicion may
be a delusion or a self-delusion, but it nevertheless provides an
excuse to vote against the resolution.
</P>
<P>
   _ It pits Starr against Lewinsky. House prosecutors spent weeks
portraying Clinton as Lewinsky's treacherous abuser. They scheduled
her deposition for Monday, hoping she would contradict Clinton's
testimony and convince senators that he had committed perjury and
obstructed justice. Instead, the Sunday Times story resurrected the
notion that Starr, not Clinton, posed the chief threat to Lewinsky.
Starr had already forced her to testify for the House prosecutors
by invoking her immunity agreement, thereby implicitly threatening
her with prosecution. Now he seemed to be threatening Clinton with
prosecution as well. Where would he stop?
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, Clinton's surrogates have been calling
Starr an ``out-of-control'' prosecutor. To their good fortune, he's
proving them right.

list; for an abbreviated list, see BC-LIST-SHORT-SLATE-NYTSF)
</P>
<P>
   1. JAMES E. JR. and VIRGINIA STOWERS--$327 million to create the
INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH in Kansas City, Mo. James Stowers
built the American Century Cos. into one of the nation's largest
families of no-load mutual funds. The Stowers, both cancer
</P>
<P>
   survivors, plan to bequeath most of their other assets to the
</P>
<P>
   institute. Having pursued an aggressive investment strategy
through holdings in American Century, they expect the endowment to
eventually grow to many billions of dollars, they told the New York
Times. The institute is scheduled to open in January 2000 in a
former hospital now being converted into a state-of-the-art
research facility. ``We're trying to get the best scientists,''
said James Stowers. ``We have to convince them we mean business.''
</P>
<P>
   2. MARTHA R. INGRAM--$300 million worth of Ingram Micro stock
</P>
<P>
   to VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY (Tenn.) to support athletics, health
</P>
<P>
   care, public service, research, and teaching. Ingram succeeded
her late husband as chairman of Ingram Industries and is a director
of California-based Ingram Micro, the world's largest wholesale
distributor of technology products and services. The Ingram
Charitable Fund's charter dedicates at least 40 percent of its
income and assets--valued at more than $300 million at the stock's
current market price--to Vanderbilt. ``This gift ... is
unprecedented in size and stands alongside Cornelius Vanderbilt's
founding gift 125 years ago as a singular landmark in the history
of this university,'' said Vanderbilt Chancellor Joe B. Wyatt.
``Like the founding gift, it is made possible by remarkable vision,
creativity, success in American industry, and personal
generosity.'' The Ingram family has a 50 year association with
Vanderbilt University. Ingram's late husband was a Vanderbilt
alumnus, and three of the couple's four children graduated from the
school.

   3. DAVID and CHERYL DUFFIELD--a $200 million pledge toward
finding a home for every stray or abandoned dog and cat in America.
The donation was inspired by the Duffields' affection for their
longtime pet, a miniature schnauzer named Maddie. David Duffield is
a co-founder of human resources software maker PeopleSoft. The
gift, believed to be the largest ever made to help companion
animals, is intended to end the euthanasia of millions of homeless
dogs and cats and in the process create a ``no-kill nation.'' The
funding will be disbursed through the recently established Duffield
Family Foundation to humane societies and animal shelters across
the United States. According to the Chicago Tribune, agencies that
within four years reduce to zero the number of adoptable animals
that are killed will receive a $1 million bonus. Although officials
at humane societies praised the Duffields' good intentions, some
animal welfare experts objected to the project's reliance on
vaguely defined terms like ``adoptable'' and ``no-kill.''

   3. KIRK KERKORIAN--a $200 million pledge to benefit the PEOPLE
OF ARMENIA from this 81-year-old son of Armenian migrs. Half the
money will be used for an interest-free lending program to benefit
entrepreneurs in Armenia and to spur economic development there.
The rest will be used primarily for road construction and to
rebuild areas harmed by the 1988 earthquake. Most of the money for
this gift will come from the Lincy Foundation, Kerkorian's family
foundation (named after his daughters, Linda and Tracy). At a
recent dinner, Kerkorian, the billionaire financier and majority
owner of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., was made an honorary Armenian
citizen.

   8. THE KATHRYN and JOE ALBERTSON FAMILY--a three year pledge of
$110 million to PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN IDAHO through the family
foundation. Spread evenly over Idaho's 626 public schools, it would
amount to approximately $176,000 per school. The Albertson
Foundation, based in Boise, became one of the nation's top 35
foundations in 1997, when Kathryn Albertson, the widow of the
grocery entrepreneur Joe Albertson, donated $660 million in company
stock to it. Joe Albertson, who built a grocery chain with stores
in 21 states, opened his first Albertson's store in Boise in the
1930s.

<P>
   9. JOAN KROC--a total of $105 million: $80 million to San
Diego's SALVATION ARMY, the largest gift received by the

Diego. The Salvation Army Ray and Joan Kroc Community Center will
include softball and soccer fields, an Olympic-size swimming pool,
a skating rink, basketball courts, fitness training for every age
group, a state-of-the-art computer research library, and a
performing and visual arts building including music lesson rooms
and rehearsal space. There will also be a 500 seat auditorium, plus
banquet facilities. Kroc said she came up with the idea after
touring the depressed eastern and southern area of the city with a
friend, former San Diego Mayor Maureen O'Connor. She chose the
Salvation Army to receive the donation in memory of her late
husband, Ray: ``I can remember with such personal delight watching
Ray in his Santa Claus hat, ringing the Salvation Army's bell at
Christmastime in downtown San Diego. Right now, I'll bet there's a
lot of bell ringing going on [in heaven], with Ray leading the
chorus.'' Also, $25 million to the UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO to
establish an institute for peace and justice, which will focus on
``San Diego's strategic importance to the Pacific Rim and Latin
America.''

   10. RALPH and BETTY ENGELSTAD--$100 million to the UNIVERSITY OF
NORTH DAKOTA to construct a 12,000 seat hockey arena and for other
undetermined uses. The new arena will replace one built in 1972
that was named after Ralph Engelstad in 1987 in honor of his
numerous gifts. That year the couple donated $5 million for
endowment; in 1998 they gave stock worth $2 million for athletics;
and also last year Ralph Engelstad donated a collection of military
documents valued at $1.4 million to the university library. He is
the owner of the Imperial Palace Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.

   10. SANFORD I. and JOAN WEILL--a $100 million pledge to the
CORNELL UNIVERSITY Medical School (N.Y.), which will be renamed for
the couple. The donation, the largest in Cornell's history, will be
used to fund research in structural biology, genetic medicine, and
the neurosciences. The school had launched a $154 million
fund-raising campaign to build its research capacity. ``It was
going a little slow, and I was getting bored,'' the New York Times
quotes Weill as saying. ``We figured maybe we could do something to
get this process going.'' Sanford Weill is a Cornell graduate, a
trustee emeritus, and chairman of the medical school board. He is
CEO of Travelers Group Inc. and future chairman of Citigroup.

   12. THE SAM and HELEN WALTON FAMILY--a total of $91.7 million:
This includes a $50 million gift to the UNIVERSITY OF ARKANSAS
College of Business Administration made through the Walton Family
Charitable Support Foundation, established by Wal-Mart's founder,
the late Sam Walton, and his wife, Helen. With this gift, Walton
family contributions to the University of Arkansas total nearly $64
million. The business school will be renamed in honor of Sam
Walton. Also, $2.2 million to BENTONVILLE HIGH SCHOOL in Arkansas.
Helen Walton announced the gift, adding that most of her children
and grandchildren have attended or are currently enrolled in the
Bentonville School District. Plus, $39.5 million as a challenge
gift to the UNIVERSITY OF THE OZARKS in Clarksville, Ark. Helen
Walton is a lifetime trustee of the university and has been the

   13. THE DANIEL R. EFROYMSON FAMILY--$90 million to the
INDIANAPOLIS FOUNDATION and the CENTRAL INDIANA COMMUNITY
FOUNDATION to create the Efroymson Family Fund. The gift will be
spent in five areas: the viability of Indianapolis, the needs of
disadvantaged people, the natural environment, historical
preservation, and the well-being of Jewish people. The family's
ties to the region go back to a one room dry-goods store started by
Gustav Efroymson in 1912, the same year he started the Public
Welfare Loan Association as a way to counter loan sharking, which
was rampant at the time. Dan Efroymson, his grandson, is chairman
of the board of advisers of the Nature Conservancy.

   14. JAMES GABBERT and MIKE LINCOLN--$70 million to the land
conservation group TRUST FOR PUBLIC LAND in San Francisco. These
business partners donated their stock in Pacific FM Inc., which
owns KOFY-TV (founded by them in 1980 and now one of the nation's
largest independent stations), to the trust, which then sold it for
$174 million. The gift was made in the form of charitable trusts,
from which the donors will receive income during their lifetimes.
The principal of the gift cannot be spent by the trust until
Gabbert's and Lincoln's deaths.

   14. ARTHUR L. and ANGELA WILLIAMS--$70 million to LIBERTY
UNIVERSITY (Va.), erasing a decade of debt and freeing its founder,
the Rev. Jerry Falwell, to resume his role as ``an outspoken
emissary for conservative Christians.'' Now, said Art Williams,
Liberty has ``a chance to become for evangelical Christians what
Notre Dame is to Catholics and what Brigham Young is to Mormons.''
Williams is a retired life insurance tycoon who settled the
university's debt in September 1997 but asked that his identity be
kept a secret. He agreed to announce the gift in early 1998 after
Falwell convinced him the publicity would provide momentum for a
campaign to raise $100 million and to double the school's
enrollment by 2005. Williams, who used to be a high-school teacher,
started the A.L. Williams Co. in 1977. He sold the company, which
dominated the market for lower-priced term insurance policies, to
Primerica (now Travelers Group) in 1989. That same year he wrote
the best-selling All You Can Do Is All You Can Do but All You Can
Do Is Enough! Williams recently bought the Tampa Bay Lightning
National Hockey League team.

   16. W. JEROME ``JERRY'' FRAUTSCHI--$50 million to MADISON, WIS.,
for the development of a downtown cultural district providing
performance, exhibition, rehearsal, administration, and storage
space for local arts organizations. The gift allows arts
organizations to focus on programming; no funding will be directed
to operations. Frautschi, 67, recently retired as vice chairman of
Webcrafters Inc., an offset printing firm. The Overture Foundation,
which Frautschi created in 1997, will oversee the effort. The
impetus for the contribution came from several recent studies
concluding that Madison is rich in visual and performing arts but
poor in facilities to present them. ``It's wonderful,'' said
Madison Mayor Sue Bauman. ``It is probably an opportunity that's
unequaled anywhere in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   16. JOHN WALTON--$50 million to the CHILDREN'S SCHOLARSHIP FUND

Museum SoHo in New York; the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice,
Italy; the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, Spain; and Deutsche
Guggenheim, Berlin. The new pledge is solely for the endowment.
Also, a $9 million addition to his previous gift of $15 million to

   threats to the environment. Edward O. Wilson, an author and
evolutionary biology professor at Harvard University, will be
chairman of the new Center for Applied Biodiversity Science's
advisory council. The executive director will be Gustavo Fonseca,
vice president of Conservation International's Brazilian programs.
The center's initial priorities will be resolving problems
associated with logging, mining, and other industrial processes.
Also, $12.5 million to CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY (England) to create a
science library to house the archives of physicist Stephen Hawking,
which include a draft of his book A Brief History of Time. The
university also houses the archives of Isaac Newton and Charles
Darwin. Gordon Moore is co-founder and chairman emeritus of Intel
Corp.

   21. MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG--$45 million to JOHNS HOPKINS
UNIVERSITY (Md.), adding to his 1995 ``first installment'' of $55
million. His overall $100 million contribution is the largest given
to a Washington-area university. ``I've been a believer that there
is nothing you can do with truly disposable income that will
</P>
<P>
   give you as much pleasure as giving it for something you believe
in and letting others take it and do important things,'' said
Bloomberg, who is chairman of the Johns Hopkins board of trustees
and a 1964 Johns Hopkins engineering graduate. Two-thirds of the
new donation is to be devoted to financial aid for full-time
undergraduates in the arts and sciences and in engineering.
Bloomberg founded Bloomberg L.P. in 1981 and has built it into a
worldwide multimedia news service for investment and securities
firms, government offices, and news organizations.

   21. SHELBY M. C. and GALE DAVIS--$45 million to the ARMAND
HAMMER UNITED WORLD COLLEGE OF THE AMERICAN WEST near Santa Fe,
N.M., to fund scholarships for Americans to study at the
internationally focused, two year preparatory school for motivated
high-school students. The school is the only United World College
in the United States and one of 10 worldwide. The system's mission
is to train students to be world leaders and to foster global
understanding. The Davises are making the gift through their S&AMP;G
Foundation. Shelby Davis, CEO of Davis Selected Advisers L.P., a

Inc. ``We've had a very good year and feel we want to give back to
the community,'' Marcus told Reuters. ``Hopefully we are going to
be joining some other philanthropists ... basically helping
children.'' Marcus also announced that the Marcus Institute of
Atlanta, which provides services for children suffering from
cerebral palsy, autism, mental retardation, brain injuries, and
learning disorders, will merge with the Kennedy Krieger Institute.

   24. RICHARD D. COLBURN--A commitment of $42 million to the
COLBURN SCHOOL OF PERFORMING ARTS in Los Angeles, across the street
from the future home of the Walt Disney Concert Hall. Of the gift,
$20 million created an endowment for the school, and $22
</P>
<P>
   million paid for the new school building. Colburn, 87, was
chairman of U.S. Rentals, based in Modesto, Calif., which he
started at age 65. The company went public in 1997 and was bought
by United Rentals Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., earlier this year.
Colburn took his first music lesson at age 7, when his mother gave
him a surprise birthday gift of a violin and took him to his first
lesson. ``She thought every person should be exposed to music,'' he
told the New York Times. He co-founded the Los Angeles Chamber
Orchestra in 1968, plays the viola, and was once a member of the

</P>
<P>
   school may use the gift at its discretion. The Huntsman family's
total contributions to Wharton now top $50 million. In July, he
announced that a sizable portion of the hundreds of millions of
dollars he will receive from the sale of Huntsman Corp.'s styrenics
business to Nova Chemicals Corp. will fund the Jon and Karen

reporters at a Moscow press conference. Publishing houses will
provide 3,500 provincial libraries with 1,000 books annually, and
the Soros Foundation will rovide $20 million for libraries in 1998
and more money next year. Other partners involved in the project
will contribute 25 percent this year, 50 percent next year, and 75
percent in the third year. ``My hope is that it will have a lasting
effect and ... not disappear when my support disappears,'' Soros
said. Also, a $9 million matching grant to the NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
FOR PUBLIC INTEREST LAW to encourage law firms and corporations to
provide legal services to low-income individuals and communities.
(Soros' Open Society Institute has already donated more than $50
million for advocacy on behalf of legal immigrants denied access to
public assistance.) And $1 million to fund the distribution of
clean needles to drug addicts through the TIDES FOUNDATION in San
Francisco. Plus, $6.4 million to expand after-school programs in 25
NEW YORK CITY PUBLIC SCHOOLS, $1 million to fund a vote education
drive to combat voter

for women's athletics. In the early '90s Loker gave $11 million to
Harvard to enable the renovation of the lower level of Memorial
Hall into the Katherine Bogdanovich Loker Commons. Loker's late
husband was an alumnus of Harvard College.

<P>
   28. THE JOSEPH L. and PHYLLIS MAILMAN FAMILY--$33 million
through their family's foundation to the COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY School
of Public Health (N.Y.), the largest donation made to a school of
public health. The school is now named in honor of the late Joseph
L. Mailman, a founder of the Mailman Corp., one of the earliest
conglomerates in North America. The gift will be used for faculty
salaries, financial aid for students, and research into such areas
as AIDS, cancer, women's reproductive health, and health care for
the poor. The Mailman Foundation, with assets of less than $50
million, consists of four family members and no staff. The family
had planned to donate less than $6 million but, after considering
many different projects to help disadvantaged people, ended up
committing far more because the school combines public policy with
hands-on treatment. No one from the Mailman family has attended
Columbia.

   29. C. EDWARD and CAROLE McVANEY--$32.2 million to the
UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA in Lincoln from these alumni to establish an

midnight shift as a U.S. Capitol policeman in the 1940s. After
graduating from Georgetown's School of Foreign Service, he worked
for the United Nations in Yugoslavia, then moved to California and
opened RemedyTemp Inc. in 1965. His company now has 230 offices and
annual revenues of $500 million. ``I just had a good feeling about
Georgetown,'' McDonough said. ``It touched my soul when I went
there, when I first walked through the gates.''

Rainwater Inc., the investment company in Fort Worth, Texas,
founded by her husband, Richard Rainwater. She has nearly tripled
the company's net worth since 1994, to $1.5 billion. ``This is the
most conservative part of the country, a state that has the
Citadel, a state where we still fly the Confederate flag, and
[where] Strom Thurmond is the dominant political force,'' Moore
told the Chronicle of Higher Education. ``And what do they do but
name their crown jewel after a woman?''

educational programs for disadvantaged youth. ``I'm a big believer
that Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs can make a real difference in helping many
thousands of kids overcome their negative circumstances at home and
[in] enhancing the education they receive in school.'' 36. DANIEL
L. RITCHIE--An 18,000 acre parcel of
</P>
<P>
   land known as the Jones Ranch, worth an estimated $25 million,
to the UNIVERSITY OF DENVER from its chancellor. When the property
is sold, the money will be earmarked for the university's athletics
program. ``I love this land, but I love the University of Denver
even more,'' Ritchie said. His previous donations--19,600 acres of
his sprawling Grand River Ranch in 1994 and another 12,500 acres in
1996--were given quietly and jump-started the university's capital
improvement fund-raising campaign. The son of a North Carolina
farm-implements salesman, Ritchie turned to full-time ranching in
1987 after having led Westinghouse Broadcasting for eight years.
Lured out of retirement in 1989 by trustee Bill Coors, Ritchie was
hired to lead the financially troubled university for $1 a year. He
soon stopped taking even that token amount.
</P>
<P>
   36. JULIAN H. ROBERTSON JR.--$25 million to LINCOLN CENTER (New
York City); $10 million of the grant will go to the center's own
artistic programs and series. The remainder will be divided among
Lincoln Center's 12 constituent members, including the New York
Metropolitan Opera, the Juilliard School, the New York City Ballet,
the New York City Opera, and the New York Philharmonic. Robertson,
66, is chairman and CEO of the multibillion dollar Tiger Management
investment fund. He intended the gift as a surprise for his wife,
Josie, the New York Times reported. Lincoln Center's fountain plaza
will be renamed for her.
</P>
<P>
   36. PETER and ADA EGBERT ROSSIN--$25 million to LEHIGH
UNIVERSITY (Pa.), which will name its engineering school in Peter
Rossin's honor. Returning to college after serving as a pilot in
World War II, he said, his grades weren't much above average--''but
what I learned, I learned well.'' He founded Dynamet Inc. in 1967,
and it became a leading domestic and international supplier of
titanium alloy products for the aerospace, medical, and sports
industries. He sold it in 1997 for $161 million. ``My wife and I
feel very strongly that one of the best ways for us to make a
contribution to society is to ensure that people are being exposed
to more and better education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   36. RICHARD and DIANE SCRUGGS--$25 million to the UNIVERSITY OF
MISSISSIPPI for faculty salaries in the College for Liberal Arts.
The couple will give $1 million annually for each of the next 25
years. Richard Scruggs said they hope the gift will increase the
university's chances of being awarded a Phi Beta Kappa chapter
soon. An attorney, he is a 1969 graduate who also earned a law
degree from the university. He is a director of the university's
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   45. PAUL and DAISY SOROS--$24 million, including a $20 million
trust to help underwrite American graduate education for immigrants
and their children. The Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowships for New
Americans will give selected students half their tuition costs,
plus $20,000 for up to three years at any U.S. graduate school.
There are 20 recipients for the 1998-99 school year. ``The big
trend in this city [New York] is putting your name on a building,
which didn't appeal to my husband,'' Daisy Soros told the New York
Times. ``I did this instead,'' said Paul Soros, who made his
fortune building industrial ports. Both he and his brother George
were born in Hungary and emigrated following World War II. They now
work together, buying and investing. According to Paul Soros, he
and his wife have given $4 million to other organizations and
causes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   46. ROBERT C. and JANICE McNAIR--a total of $22 million: $2
million in September to the SOUTH CAROLINA AQUARIUM, its largest
gift to date, to sponsor the Great Hall, a soaring, sunlight-filled
space with a tank of schooling fish and a map of the state's coast
on the floor. ``We know that every child is a precious resource who
deserves a good education,'' the McNairs said. ``But schools cannot
do the job alone.'' Also, $20 million to the UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH
CAROLINA to endow the McNair Scholars Program, designed to attract
some of America's most academically talented students to the
school. Robert McNair is a 1958 graduate of the university and
founder and CEO of Houston-based Cogen Technologies Energy Group,
the largest privately owned cogeneration company in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   58. GORDON A. and MARY CAIN--a total of $15 million: $10 million
to LOUISIANA STATE UNIVERSITY for the department of chemical
engineering, and $5 million to RICE UNIVERSITY (Texas) to develop
writing and communication programs for science and engineering
students. Gordon Cain, an LSU alumnus, is the former chairman of
Sterling Chemicals, and the co-founder of the Sterling Group, a
merchant bank that sponsors and invests in leveraged buyouts in the
petrochemical industry.
</P>
<P>
   58. JACK and CAMILLE ``CAMMY'' GAREY--a $15 million bequest
promise to SOUTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY (Texas). The donors say they
have invested their eight figure donation and will bequeath it to
the school when they die. The earnings will go into an endowment
entirely for scholarships. Jack Garey, 68, is a former workers'
compensation attorney and the owner of Garey Construction Co. of
Austin, a major highway contractor. Cammy Garey, 58, is a retired
physical therapist who manages the family cattle ranch. The Gareys
are University of Texas graduates.

</P>
<P>
   58. IRWIN M. and JOAN K. JACOBS--$15 million to the UNIVERSITY
OF CALIFORNIA, SAN DIEGO for an endowment to hire additional
faculty and to support a major expansion of the school of
engineering--which has been named for the Jacobses--among other
purposes. Irwin Jacobs is a former professor of computer science
and engineering at what was then UCSD's school of applied
electrophysics. He is also the founder of Qualcomm Inc., a digital
communications company. Joan Jacobs serves on the board of
overseers, an advisory group to the chancellor. She co-founded the
UCSD Friends of the International Center.
</P>
<P>
   58. GEORGE DEAN JR. and SUSAN JOHNSON--$15 million to CONVERSE
COLLEGE (S.C.) as a challenge gift if others give twice as much.
The bulk of the gift will go toward the construction of a
</P>
<P>
   technology building. The remainder of the Johnsons' donation, as
well as the challenge funds, will be used to finance other projects
such as scholarships, new curricula, and endowment. George Johnson
is president of Extended Stay America, which owns and manages
lodgings for people who conduct out-of-town business.
</P>
<P>
   58. BERNARD OSHER--a total of $15 million: $10 million to the
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT SAN FRANCISCO to establish the Osher
Center for Integrative Medicine. The UCSF School of Medicine has
committed an additional $1.1 million to the center, and UCSF
Stanford Health Care has matched the school's financial commitment.
Also, $4 million divided equally among BATES COLLEGE, BOWDOIN
COLLEGE, COLBY COLLEGE, and the UNIVERSITY OF MAINE system
</P>
<P>
   for scholarship aid to in-state students. Osher was born in
Biddeford, Maine, and graduated from Bowdoin in 1948. ``I grew up
in Maine, and I know what a struggle it is for many Maine families
and their talented sons and daughters to cope with the costs of
college,'' said Osher, who is 70. Also, $1 million to the SAN
FRANCISCO ART INSTITUTE for scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   58. GERALD ``RED'' RATNER--$15 million to the UNIVERSITY OF
CHICAGO to help build the Gerald Ratner Athletics Center. Ratner is
a 1935 graduate of the university, which has long been concerned
that it was losing potential students to Stanford, Harvard, and
other top universities that offer a more attractive social life on
campus. The center ``will help us realize a dream that we and many
alumni have shared for years,'' said university President Hugo
Sonnenschein.
</P>
<P>
   58. HENRY R. SILVERMAN--$15 million to the UNIVERSITY OF
PENNSYLVANIA Law School to renovate a 98-year-old building, to be
renamed for Silverman, which was part of the school's original
campus. The former head of Cendant Corp., a business and consumer
services company based in Connecticut and New Jersey, Silverman is
a 1964 alumnus and a trustee of the school.
</P>
<P>
   58. ROBERT H. SMITH--$15 million to the UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND
AT COLLEGE PARK for the business school, which has been renamed for
the donor. The gift will endow professorships,scholarships,
fellowships, a career management center, and a dean's discretionary
fund. Smith, a 1950 graduate of the business school, said he
accelerated his gift when he learned that William E. Kirwan, the
university's president, was leaving Maryland in the summer of 1998
to become president of Ohio State University. Smith is co-CEO and
co-chairman of Charles E. Smith Residential Realty Inc., a publicly
traded real estate investment trust that developed Crystal City
near Alexandria, Va. He also serves on the board of trustees of the
National Gallery of Art and the National Portrait Gallery.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Harness my dog, muzzle my wallet
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ I stopped by the hardware store the
other day, trying to find a harness for my $2,000 dog.
</P>
<P>
   That's Buster, the little rat terrier, white with black spots, I
found some six years ago under the overpass and brought home to
join our Family of Dog, presently numbering eight.
</P>
<P>
   Little did I know at the time Buster would turn out to be a
$2,000 dog. Imagine my surprise!
</P>
<P>
   The boys at the hardware store thought I was bragging.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't bragging.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, you wouldn't know it to look at Buster.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of a Jack Russell terrier. Buster's more of a jack
rabbit terrier, such are his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he has a little ``yo quiero'' in him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, when I brought Buster home to live with us, it was love
at first sight for him and my wife.
</P>
<P>
   She still talks about that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming in the back door,'' she relates, dreamily, ``and
he was coming around the corner into the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our eyes met,'' her voice trails off for a moment, ``and we
knew we were made for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, she sees as made of money, which is lucky
for Buster.
</P>
<P>
   Buster had been having back problems for some time. But one
morning last month when he got out of bed (yes, he sleeps in the
bed with us), Buster tried to take a step and simply fell over.
</P>
<P>
   We rushed him to the vet and soon got the report that there was
pressure on his spinal cord, probably from a slipped disk, and he'd
need an operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were my dog,'' our vet advised, ``I'd take him to
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we took off for Houston, where there's a special pet
hospital for neurosurgery, as well as cardiac care, cancer
treatment and most anything you'd find in a people hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Buster had his surgery, and Buster's doing fine. Never mind that
after a week in the hospital he came home looking a bit like
Frankenbuster, what with the stitches.
</P>
<P>
   He's presently halfway through five weeks of ``cage rest''
convalescence. Buster's making the best of it, and, for a fact, the
best is none too good for Buster. My wife lined the cage with an
electric blanket.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I was at the hardware store shopping for a harness is
that Buster can no longer wear a collar. If he pulled on his leash,
wearing a collar, he well might reinjure himself.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason I call him my $2,000 dog ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, you don't have to take my word for it.
</P>
<P>
   I have the papers to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the bill from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not bragging.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm complaining, either.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mel Gibson's sick streak gets another amusing
workout in ``Payback.'' It's a brutally jaunty, fanatically
fetishized, cartoon crime thriller.
</P>
<P>
   It's not really a remake of John Boorman's severe '60s
masterpiece ``Point Blank,'' but rather a different take on the
same Donald Westlake source novel, ``The Hunter.'' Neither is
``Payback'' a great movie like ``Blank'' was, though it's admirably
just as nasty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' doesn't need to be great, however. It's the kind of
movie that's so committed to its silly, relentless agenda, you're
beaten into enjoying it almost to the point where you'd ask for
more.
</P>
<P>
   Almost.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson is Porter (no last name, or is it no first?) a
professional crook who was left for dead by a double-crossing
partner (Gregg Henry's Val) and a scorned wife (Deborah Kara Unger)
after they successfully heisted $140,000 from Chinese money
launderers. But Porter survived two bullets in the back, and a few
months later he's back on the streets of a decrepit, unnamed
eastern city, seeking revenge and his half of the loot.
</P>
<P>
   Just his half? Nothing for pain and suffering? Seems so.
Porter's motives are pretty inscrutable, both to viewers and the
parade of Val's higher-up mob bosses (William Devane, James Coburn,
Kris Kristofferson), who keep thinking the implacable avenger wants
more money than he really does.
</P>
<P>
   What Porter really wants, apparently, is any excuse that
presents itself to kill a Val associate, regardless of how
peripherally they're connected to the flashy, pain-loving gangster.
Porter would also like a high-class hooker (``ER's'' Maria Bello),
whom he drove around in a previous incarnation, to quit the trade
and be his baby. His is a simple life, but a full one.
</P>
<P>
   An array of colorful secondary characters add a kind of richness
to the movie's minimalist, killing machine mechanics. David Paymer
is typecast, but effectively so, as a low-rent weasel who foolishly
views Porter's rampage as his ticket to a higher class of crime.
Bill Duke and Jack Conley register as a pair of distinctively
annoying, crooked cops.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Lucy Liu. She plays Val's leather-clad
dominatrix Pearl, a sadomasochist of such dedication that she
swoons in ecstasy whenever guns are pointed in anyone's direction.
Objectification is way too weak a word to describe this act _
full-blown fantasy freakout is a little more accurate. Indeed, Liu
takes the lewd stereotype to such ridiculous lengths, it could be
said that she effectively demolishes it.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the actress, who plays ``Ally McBeal's''
uproariously uptight Ling, gets to cut loose here like nobody's
business. And let's face it: Pearl embodies everything this
pornographically vicious movie aspires to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' was co-adapted and directed, for the most part, by
Brian Helgeland, who's had wildly varying luck at screenwriting for
the films ``L.A. Confidential,'' ``The Postman'' and the
Gibson-starring ``Conspiracy Theory.'' That last one led Gibson,
whose company produced ``Payback,'' to give Helgeland a shot at
directing.
</P>
<P>
   The novice helmer had some good ideas, such as the
color-drained, cool blue look of the photography; its retro-faded
non-sheen helps to stabilize the crazy, comic book tone of the
action. Still, Gibson reportedly had a hunk of the film's final act
reshot by another, unnamed hand, supposedly because the actor was
worried that bad-to-the-bone Porter came off just a bit too
unredeemable for his movie-star image.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But the guy's still a violent sociopath, even if he is
the hero. And that's one of the few qualities that makes Gibson an
occasionally interesting actor.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clint Eastwood before him and Nicolas Cage since, Gibson is
one of Hollywood's few major movie stars who has a consistent
appreciation of perversity. ``Braveheart's'' savage butchery, his
genuinely unhinged work in the first ``Lethal Weapon,'' those
demented ``Mad Max'' dress-up derbies; Gibson clearly has a bent
for the bent.
</P>
<P>
   And he seems to enjoy himself so much more in those kinds of
things than in his serious or charm-dependent star turns. At least,
it appears he gets more comfortable as the mayhem gets kinkier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' isn't exactly a good movie, but it is good, dirty
fun. And it's good for Mel. And it's fun for us.

   LOS ANGELES _ A fine, observant study of a recovering alcoholic
goes somewhat astray in ``My Name Is Joe.'' But for the most part,
it's an absorbing portrait of a good man who's cleaned up his act
but is ultimately undone by the messy world he inhabits.
</P>
<P>
   That restricted, hopeless locale is one of the poorer districts
of Glasgow, Scotland, and it says something about the nature of the
place that the film had to be subtitled for Americans to understand
it. The working-class accents _ make that nonworking-class accents
_ are emblematic of the locals' inescapable entrapment in their
neighborhood's pathological culture.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not the same thing as saying they're dumb, or even
necessarily doomed. Indeed, protagonist Joe Kavanagh (Peter Mullan,
in a Cannes Film Festival prize-winning performance) is as bright
and humorous and self-aware as a bloke could be, especially now
that he's flushed with the kind of optimistic drive many newly
sober addicts exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, director Ken Loach, the English radical with the
keen, sympathetic eye for society's castoffs, is not about to
depict Joe or his associates in any way that disrespects their
humanity. Though he's recently been indulging his penchant for
muddled, lefty politics in films such as ``Carla's Song'' and
``Land and Freedom,'' Loach's best films of late _ ``Riff-Raff,''
``Raining Stones,'' ``Ladybird, Ladybird'' _ all detail the
personal struggles of Britain's poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe'' is terrifically compelling while it's doing just that.
Mullan exudes a middle-age everyguy charisma similar to that of
Paul Newman a few decades back. Though Joe is unemployed and just
slightly larcenous _ he drives the getaway van when members of the
ex-addicts soccer team he coaches steal a consignment of cool new
uniforms _ Mullan invests him with gruff sweetness and
nigh-irresistible charm.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is also touchingly vulnerable and wary of the dark side
drink brought out of him. While shyly but persistently wooing
government health counselor Sarah Downey (Louise Goodall), he tells
her right up front what a mean drunk he used to be. This does not
deter her from embarking on an affair with Joe any more than their
obvious class and education differences do. The relationship proves
a good one. Until ...
</P>
<P>
   A subplot involving a young soccer player (David McKay) and his
still-using wife (Anne-Marie Kennedy) takes on increasing
significance as both Joe and Sarah try to help the troubled couple.
As a result, and rather unconvincingly, Joe gets more and more
deeply involved with local mobsters. The film unnecessarily
descends into crime thriller cliches and violence, much of it an
apparent effort to force Joe back to the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   It feels like overkill. The virtues of ``My Name Is Joe'' may be
small, homely ones, but they would have been amply sufficient to
carry the film to a satisfying, less melodramatic conclusion.

 BUY THE MUSIC, BUT SKIP `THE 60s'  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The '60s,'' the NBC miniseries, is much like the decade it
ambitiously sets out to portray. It starts out with great promise,
but in the end leaves almost everyone who went through it
disillusioned.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah: And it has a great soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with this two-part movie (Sunday and Monday, 9 p.m.
EDT, check local listings) is right there in its promotional tag
line, the double-entendre ``Movie Event of a Generation.'' It sets
out to do too much, promises more than it can deliver, and
disappoints all. This isn't even a movie event of a weekend.
</P>
<P>
   What viewers are left with is a four-hour excuse to link
together documentary footage we've seen before, show actors in
bizarre clothes and play cool tunes. This is ``Forrest Gump''
without the story.
</P>
<P>
   And that is too bad, since the tumultuous decade has enough
built-in dramatic confrontation _ militarily, culturally,
generationally, racially _ to fill a series. In short, NBC picked a
perfect vehicle for a miniseries _ and blew it.
</P>
<P>
   The network, which scored big time with its outstanding
``Temptations'' miniseries a few months back, went to the '60s well
once too often (its stab at the 1860s, an updating of ``The
Tempest,'' was lame). It's enough to make you angry, not because
it's so bad, but because it should have been so good.
</P>
<P>
   Executive Producer Lynda Obst was the editor/author of ``The
Rolling Stone History of the Sixties,'' and had the perfect
pedigree for the project. If she only had a script.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is solid: track the 1960s through the eyes of two
families, one black, the other white.
</P>
<P>
   The Herlihys are a middle-class Catholic clan from Chicago, with
eldest son, Brian (Jerry O'Connell), the football star and dad's
favorite. Middle son Michael (Josh Hamilton) is the straight-A's
kid with a social conscious, while daughter Katie (Julia Stiles)
grows up without anyone noticing until it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the Taylors, headed by Willie Taylor (Charles
Dutton), a black Baptist minister from Greenwood, Miss. He was an
early organizer for the Freedom Riders in the early '60s, but his
son Emmet (Leonard Roberts) does not share his belief in nonviolent
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   The two families cross paths on occasion _ Michael goes down to
Mississippi to a freedom march, Emmet and Katie are in
Haight-Asbury during the Summer of Love _ but mostly the fictional
characters are used as sketchy props to string together highlights
of the decade.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Herlihy signs up for the Marine Corps, excited to go to
Vietnam. He returns sullen and bitter: We can guess why he turned,
but they never show us the specific reasons other than shots of him
looking fierce and frightened in short battle scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael enters the anti-war movement, but we don't know how much
of his activism is out of conviction, and how much is part of an
effort to woo Sarah (Jordana Brewster), a Barnard College student
activist. Katie leaves home pregnant, but it's not made clear why
she can't return.
</P>
<P>
   We know why Emmet turns his cheek on nonviolence, but the story
of the Taylors is woefully undertold _ close to abandoned _ in the
second half of the story.
</P>
<P>
   The only character who is given any substance is Bill Herlihy
(Bill Smirtrovich of ``Life Goes On''). We understand his
conflicted rages and confusion as his children are caught up and
swept away in the evolving maelstrom of the times, a tide he is
unable to stem. In the end, the World War II veteran lets love
trump understanding; it was the only recourse.
</P>
<P>
   There are other flaws. We could go on, but you don't have to. If
you want, go ahead and buy the soundtrack (there really is a pretty
good one in stores: Bob Dylan (with Joan Osborne), The Temps, James
Brown, The Band, and Marvin Gaye, among others).
</P>
<P>
   As for the movie, figuring out what Dylan could possibly be
saying most of the time is easier than watching this mess.

THE THREE-LAWS-AND-YOUR-OUT LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Here's my simple idea for keeping the San
Francisco Board of Supervisors from spending its time passing
useless, symbolic ordinances: Limit each supervisor to one piece of
legislation per month.
</P>
<P>
   That would keep them from doing most of the silly things they do
_ like passing resolutions against pie-throwing, condemning the use
of animals in medical research and drafting ordinances limiting
handgun sales in San Francisco to one a month.
</P>
<P>
   You mean I'll only be able to buy 12 guns a year? I'll have to
cross the Bay to arm my militia?
</P>
<P>
   That isn't quite the issue here, nor is it whether you hate guns
and Charlton Heston. The issue is whether the legislation does
anything.
</P>
<P>
   You see, there's only one gun store in town, the San Francisco
Gun Exchange. Supervisor Michael Yaki's legislation isn't going to
do much, because the store doesn't sell heaps of cheap handguns to
middlemen who resell them to bad guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we saw someone buying in quantity, we'd notify the
authorities,'' said co-owner Bob Posner, who is on good terms with
all the law enforcement authorities because they shop at his store.
</P>
<P>
   Ask the authorities where the illegal guns come from. They'll
tell you, and those places are out of the city's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco the main shooting sport is taking political
potshots at those who deal in politically incorrect products. The
Board of Supervisors is constantly popping away with small-bore
symbolic legislation in Posner's general direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, the Department of Parking and Traffic does more to
control sales of guns here because of all the cars they tow out
front,'' Posner said.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors have more symbolic legislation to come. Yaki has
an ordinance drafted that would limit ammunition sales before New
Year's and the Fourth of July to prevent people from shooting guns
into the air.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that even idiots who shoot guns into the air know
enough to save up ammo for holidays. Never mind that no one in San
Francisco has ever been hit by a falling holiday bullet.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the city's legislative analyst said the San
Francisco police only receive a half-dozen reports of gunshots on
each holiday, and most turn out to be firecrackers. Never mind that
shooting a gun within the city is a felony, and cops can arrest
idiots who do it.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to have symbolic laws that pretend to address gun
violence, but do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   As for San Francisco joining other cities in a lawsuit against
gun manufacturers, that's another issue, a complicated one.
</P>
<P>
   For example, part of the suit depends on holding manufacturers
responsible for not introducing personalized, high-tech safety
devices that haven't been invented yet and are likely never to be
practicable.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to beat the gun makers. It's easier to pick on the
one gun store in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors should try doing some things that aren't purely
symbolic _ with their one piece of legislation per month.
</P>
<P>
   Pardon me, I'm a liberal, but I just have to say it: When
useless legislation is outlawed, only useless legislators will be
outlaws.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the supervisors really take the prize: Tom Ammiano's
color posters from the last election, showing him practically
wrapped in the flag, have won a national ``Polli'' award for best
poster from the American Association of Political Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty ironic, considering I tried to regulate political
consultants,'' Ammiano said.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's news that matters. Supervisor Mark Leno has declared
Feb. 11 as ``Wild Parrot Day'' in San Francisco. The 50 glorious
green parrots that live on Telegraph Hill will be starring in a
children's fable called ``The Wild Parrots of San Francisco'' by
Sundance Festival award winners Judy Irving and Christopher Beaver.
The movie is a mix of fiction and nonfiction, much like San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   There's another flock of parrots in San Francisco, a flock that
lives in the palms along Dolores Street. They're hungry and
starting to maraud, swooping in to bird feeders in Upper Noe
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   You have to love these parrots. Like many of us, they've found a
home in a curious place and made it curiouser.

PASTA, THE PERFECT FOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Pasta may be the perfect food.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy, convenient, inexpensive and, thanks to the Food and
Drug Administration, it's more nutritious than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Always low in calories (about 200 per cup cooked) and fat (one
to two grams per cup), manufacturers are now required to fortify
pasta with folate, a B vitamin that may prevent neural-tube birth
defects such as spina bifida and help reduce the risk of heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some flavored pastas contain large amounts of
dietary fiber. But watch out for sodium. While some pastas are
sodium-free, others contain as much as 45 milligrams per cup.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the most time-consuming thing about pasta is boiling the
water. So, put the pan of water on the stove as soon as you arrive
home and read the mail or talk to your family while you wait.
</P>
<P>
   Allow 3/4 cup dry pasta (about one cup cooked) for each serving
if using in a side dish or 1 1/2 cups dry if using as an entree. If
you have trouble figuring out how much spaghetti (or other long,
thin pasta) to add to the pot remember, one 1-pound box contains
enough for four entree servings.
</P>
<P>
   Don't fret about making too much; extra cooked pasta can be
tossed with a tablespoon of olive oil, sealed in a plastic bag and
refrigerated up to three days.
</P>
<P>
   Pasta sauces can be made from almost anything in a matter of
minutes. Here are a few suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cut 2 pork chops into thin strips. Heat 2 teaspoons olive oil
in a saute pan, toss in pork and 2 tablespoons pine nuts and cook
until pork is no longer pink. Toss pork mixture with cooked pasta
and top with fresh basil and parmesan cheese.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cook 1 (10-ounce) package frozen broccoli florets in microwave
for 3 to 4 minutes on high power. Drain well. Heat 2 tablespoons
olive oil in skillet. Add 2 cloves chopped garlic, 1/4 cup yellow
bell pepper strips, broccoli, 1/2 pound peeled shrimp, cooked
pasta, salt and pepper to taste. Cook until shrimp are pink and
pasta and vegetables are heated through. Drizzle with fresh lemon
juice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large saute pan. Add 2 cloves
chopped garlic, 1 can chopped tomatoes, 1 teaspoon dried or 1
tablespoon fresh oregano, 1 teaspoon dried or 1 tablespoon fresh
basil and cooked pasta. When pasta and tomatoes are heated, add 1/2
cup crumbled feta cheese and toss until cheese begins to melt.
Serve with slivers of parmesan cheese on top.

DON'T BECOME A VICTIM OF OVER-40 BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Suppose affirmative action was changed to
include everyone over 40. How many politicians would have the
chutzpah to vote against it?
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative action is designed to help groups who are getting
discriminated against in the workplace, and people over 40
certainly qualify. How bad is it? The cover story in the Feb. 1
issue of Fortune magazine called ``Finished at 40.''
</P>
<P>
   If anyone ever did include people over 40, you can bet those
politicians who suddenly decided to embrace affirmative action
would come up with some justification for changing their minds.
They would not just come out and say, ``I know where my bread's
buttered _ and people over 40 have a lot of butter.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, those who have supported affirmative action
for decades might feel awkward. After all, people over 40 certainly
haven't faced the type of bigotry in society that racial minorities
have, and God knows there are tons of chief executives over 40.
</P>
<P>
   Workplace prejudice has been around forever. But for a lot of
people over 40 _ particularly white males _ this may be the first
time it has hit home.
</P>
<P>
   The Fortune story also mentions a 1998 survey by management
consulting firm Watson Wyatt Worldwide, which asked 773 chief
executives to identify the age when people's productivity peaked.
The average response was 43.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, people have the skill and the power to change
the system. If you have it, use it. But if you don't, here are some
ways to lessen the impact of age discrimination on your career:
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Older workers won't work as hard as younger ones, they're more
set in their ways and they don't embrace new technology. That's the
stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Is it true? Sure, sometimes. Name any stereotype and you can
always find someone who fits it; that's how it became a stereotype.
Once a stereotype is in place, it's almost impossible to get rid of
it because narrow-minded people will always find enough anecdotes
to reinforce their position.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect people to deny that discrimination exists.
</P>
<P>
   There will continue to be plenty of workers over 40 or 50 or 60,
and companies will point to them and say, ``See? We don't
discriminate.'' They're the same sort of people who point to Jesse
Jackson and Colin Powell and Michael Jordan and say, ``See? Blacks
have equal opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   They're rationalizing. It's a waste of time to try to convince
them they're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't give people an excuse to extend the stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   Except in cases of extreme bigotry, companies find a way to keep
their top people. If you're not one of the top people at your
company _ at least within your classification _ either become one
or find another job or another company.
</P>
<P>
   If you find yourself going through the motions or saying
``that's not my job,'' you'll not only make it harder for yourself,
but for everyone else your age.
</P>
<P>
   _ Be better than the competition.
</P>
<P>
   If all you have are the same qualifications as someone 10 years
younger, getting or keeping a job will be almost impossible unless
you're a union member or have blackmail photos of the boss. The
younger workers have more potential than you do.
</P>
<P>
   Your experiences in work and in life give you a lot to offer an
employer. But that won't do you any good if you don't package it
well.

BOOK OFFERS MONEY ADVICE FOR WOMEN THAT GUYS NEED, TOO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVE MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sometimes the biggest career mistake you can
make has nothing to do with your career at all. It has to do with
the most tangible thing you get out of your career: money.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco financial adviser David Bach, author of the
recently published ``Smart Women Finish Rich,'' said in an
interview that workers of both sexes often don't get as much as
they can out of their pay and benefits. Here are some of his
workplace-related tips:
</P>
<P>
   _ Put as much as possible into your 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   If your company lets you put in 15 percent of your salary, do
it, Bach said. He said that having money taken out of your paycheck
before you have the chance to spend it makes it simpler to save.
</P>
<P>
   The money that goes into your 401(k) isn't taxed at the time you
deposit it, so even putting in the 15 percent will reduce your
take-home pay by less than 10 percent because of the tax savings.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't try to time the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   It's best to invest for the long term, particularly with money
intended for retirement. Even if stocks seem to be near a peak,
Bach suggests putting your long-term money in them because
traditionally they have done so much better than bonds or bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't build enough for retirement if you invest too
conservatively,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to time the market often causes people to miss out on
major rallies. As an example, Bach said that if someone invested
$100 in the S&AMP;P 500 in 1946 and left it there for 50 years, it
would have grown to $31,000. If that person tried to time the
market, however, and missed just 5 percent of the best growth
months during those years, the investment would have grown to only
$2,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ Take your 401(k) with you.
</P>
<P>
   When people leave a company, they often leave their 401(k) money
in their existing account rather than rolling it over into an IRA
or their new company's 401(k). That can cost you a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   The 401(k) might have more fees than an IRA, and your former
company might lose track of you if you move. Bach also said that if
your former company shifts its 401(k) plan from one investment
company to another and its trustees can't find you, the money
probably will be put in a money market account rather than a stock
or bond fund.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't borrow from your 401(k).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a huge mistake,'' he said. ``I tell people the last
place to go is your retirement account. That's why it's called a
retirement account.''
</P>
<P>
   One potentially dangerous aspect about borrowing from the 401(k)
is that if you quit or get fired, the employer can kick you out of
the plan. If that happens and you can't repay the loan immediately,
the money you borrowed is considered a distribution _ meaning you
could have to pay income taxes and a 10 percent penalty.
</P>
<P>
   _ Get paid what you're worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the average worker right now is earning 10 to 30
percent less than they could be if they took a more proactive role
in their career,'' Bach said. ``If you're a worker who's truly
adding value, you'd better be earning near the top of your pay
scale.''
</P>
<P>
   If you believe you're underpaid, don't rush right in and demand
a raise. Bach suggests talking to your boss or clients and asking
how you can add value to their business.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you've done that, then you go back,'' he said. ``The key
is you've got to add value first.''
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the book's suggestions would work equally well
for both sexes, Bach said he aimed it at women because many have
never been taught about investing, often relying on men to do it
for them. He said good investing is probably more crucial for women
than men because they are out of work more often; in the book, he
says that a typical woman spends 11 1/2 years of her working life
out of work, compared with only 16 months for the typical man.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Bach said, women who develop financial savvy
are usually better investors than men. In the book, he says that
investment clubs run by women have outperformed those of men in
nine of the last 12 years, according to the National Association of
Investors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``When women are given the education on money,'' Bach said,
``then they're great on saving, they're great on commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle for both sexes is procrastination, Bach
said. In the book, he writes about how people consider what would
happen if they received a 10 percent pay cut. Would they have to
quit their job? Would they have to sell their home? Would their
spouse leave them? Probably not. Then why not put the 10 percent
into savings?
</P>
<P>
   ``There are really two options in life: You can be either
reactive or proactive to circumstances,'' Bach writes. ``And it's a
lot more fun and a lot less painful to be proactive _ to make
decisions about your life before events take control of you.''
</P>
<P>
   For those who have trouble finding the money to save, Bach said,
consider the money you spend on coffee or snacks each day. In the
book, he recalled talking to a 23-year-old woman who spent $5 a day
on coffee and sweets. If she had saved that money, it would add up
to nearly $2,000 a year for her retirement plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she put in $2,000 every year, and she invested it all in
stocks (which have enjoyed an average growth rate of 11 percent a
year over the last 50 years), chances are that by the time she
reached 65, she would have more than $2 million sitting in her
account,'' Bach writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, she would be able to retire a
multimillionaire.''

GIBSON STOKES THE RAGE WITHIN FOR `PAYBACK'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Note use of ITAL and UNITAL throughout to indicate
italics) 
 
 
By GLENN WHIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
  
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ The anger has always been there. It's not like
you had to look hard to find it. It's even incorporated into the
name of one of his most famous alter egos, (ITAL) Mad (UNITAL) Max.
The anger follows him, too. Mel Gibson rarely goes anywhere these
days without some appreciative lunatic shouting at the top of his
lungs, ``GIVE ME BACK MY SON!'' the fuming catch-phrase Gibson
spewed a couple of years ago in ``Ransom.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his nasty new movie, ``Payback,'' Gibson has taken his
madness to such an outrageous level that even he is wondering just
how audiences are going to react. His character, Porter, is a
pigheaded petty thief straight out of a Peckinpah movie. When an
accomplice double-crosses Porter and leaves him for dead, he boils
over and goes after his enemies (and his share of the loot) with a
single-minded viciousness that would turn Dirty Harry a whiter
shade of pale.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was making `Braveheart,' I remember thinking that some
of the footage might have been too gory,'' Gibson, 43, says of the
movie that won him Oscars for directing and producing. ``And then
when I showed it to an audience, and they were going for the vomit
bags, I kind of knew for sure. But I don't think there was one
excessive frame in that movie _ not even when I took the ball and
chain to that guy's face.'' Gibson pauses and lets out a throaty
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Payback,' '' Gibson continues, ``is a different animal.
There's this perverse mix of brutality and whimsy that most people
get, but you do wonder because it's way out there. It's a tricky
balance. It's like those old Don Siegel movies (`Coogan's Bluff,'
`Dirty Harry'), but since it's 25, 30 years later, we push the
envelope a bit more. It's complete, utter nihilism but with a funny
sensibility. I don't know, maybe people will think it's just
completely sick and twisted.''
</P>
<P>
   If audiences do recoil or complain, don't think Gibson's
feelings will be hurt. After all, he made ``Payback'' on a goof,
and it only cost some 20-odd million to make. This isn't ``Lethal
Weapon IV.'' (Or I, II or III for that matter.) What it is _ and
Gibson, one of the least self-analytical people on the planet,
would screw his face into a knot at the mere mention of this _ is a
glimpse into the actor's psyche, the dark side of Mel, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is somewhere an incredibly dark person, an incredibly angry
guy,'' says Jodie Foster, who has remained close to Gibson since
they made ``Maverick'' together. ``So he's not a saint.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he ever claimed to be. In fact, Gibson is the great
loose cannon among movie stars, the actor most likely to make an
angry screed. ``He is able to convey pure rage better than anyone I
know,'' says ``Ransom'' director Ron Howard. ``Where that comes
from, I'm not sure. But I wouldn't want to be on the wrong side of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have felt Gibson's wrath surely don't forget it. In
``Braveheart,'' there's a scene where an angry mob pelts Gibson's
character, freedom fighter William Wallace, with all manner of
produce. The extras took a little too much pleasure in their work,
prompting Gibson to halt filming and scream at those assembled,
``If I find out who's doing this, I'll cut his balls off.''
Needless to say, the next head of cabbage wasn't thrown quite so
hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm terribly vindictive,'' Gibson admitted once. ``If someone
ripped me apart in the press, I'd kill them. I would (ITAL) have
(UNITAL) them killed and no one would ever know.'' He went on to
describe an Australian pesticide, 1080, that was odorless,
colorless and tasteless and able to deliver an instant brain
hemorrhage with just one teaspoon.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Gibson can be famously charming, too, an observation
I'm not just making in order to keep my brain from bleeding out of
my ears. (Besides, he was probably joking about that 1080 thing.
Really.) During a recent conversation we had while watching the
Jets and the Broncos in the AFC Championship game (more anger, more
violence!), Gibson glibly tossed off thoughts on a number of
topics, including:
</P>
<P>
   Why he isn't making a big-screen version of ``Hogan's Heroes,''
despite press reports to the contrary: ``Are you kidding? That's a
bad idea whose time has (ITAL) not (UNITAL) come.''
</P>
<P>
   Why he did make another ``Lethal Weapon'' film despite saying
for years that he wouldn't: ``It was a Pavlovian response to being
locked in a room with (director) Dick Donner and (producer) Joel
Silver. After tossing out a bunch of funny ideas, they rang the
bell, and I started drooling, begging for more. And I think it
turned out pretty OK.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't mince any words either about the problems he had with
rookie director Brian Helgeland, the man he had to dismiss from
``Payback.'' This came after Gibson saw the rough cut of the movie,
suggested some changes and asked Helgeland to make them. When
Helgeland (who wrote Gibson's ``Conspiracy Theory'') declined,
Gibson took matters into in his own hands, hiring screenwriter
friend Terry Hayes (``The Road Warrior'') and bringing in a mystery
director (his old friend Donner?) to reshoot the film's final 30
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hated doing it, and I had to really ask myself if my
motivations were some kind of star trip,'' Gibson says, scratching
his gray-flecked beard. ``But I was also the producer and, as such,
I had a responsibility to the movie. And I wasn't the only one who
thought the movie wasn't there. Everyone who came out of the
screening room felt the same way I did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian stuck to his guns, and I respect him for that,'' Gibson
continues. ``He was very professional and, for the most part, the
film as it stands reflects his vision. But there were changes that
had to be made. And ultimately, if he wanted final cut, he should
have gotten that in writing. I really resent all this stuff about
how I took over the movie, when the fact is that, as producer, it
was my movie to take over. I did what I had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   And what does he have to do now? While Gibson talks about
acquiring some company for ``the boys'' (his name for his two
Oscars), he has an impulsive nature and hates the idea of any kind
of plan or rules dictating the shape of his career. ``I'm not one
of these people who has every move mapped out for the next 10
years,'' Gibson cracks. ``Life's too short to make it boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Few stars would touch ``Payback,'' and Gibson's next role in Wim
Wenders' ``The Million Dollar Motel'' seems to stray a bit from the
mainstream as well. Gibson will play a federal agent who looks into
a billionaire's death in a flophouse. The film was co-written by
Wenders, Nicholas Klein and U2's Bono, an unusual team that Gibson
says ``came up with something quite provocative. It's going to be
an interesting movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson is also circling another movie from another unusual team:
``Patriot,'' a Revolutionary War drama from German director Roland
Emmerich and his producing partner Dean Devlin, the filmmakers who
made ``Godzilla'' and ``Independence Day.'' But what he really
wants to do is direct ``Fahrenheit 451,'' and he's hoping it will
star Brad Pitt. He and screenwriter Hayes have been working on a
new adaptation of the Ray Bradbury classic for the past three
years, but it still seems at least a year away from the starting
gate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have to fall in place for that to happen,''
Gibson says. Among them are ironing out the shooting logistics and
finding a window in Pitt's schedule. Gibson says he won't rush
things. ``I won't wait forever, but it will get made. I promise you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity of the last sentence underscores the sometimes
lofty nature of Gibson's career ambitions _ ``Lethal Weapon IV''
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Truth be told, Mel has some pretty high aspirations for his
work,'' says ``Braveheart'' screenwriter Randall Wallace. ``He
gives off this devil-may-care attitude, but he throws himself into
whatever he does.''
</P>
<P>
   And whether that involves preparing for his seventh child with
Robyn, his wife of nearly 20 years (his initial reaction: ``Oh no!
Another teen-ager!'') or quitting cigarettes for the umpteenth
time, Gibson will approach the task with an energy level that
borders on maniacal. And sometimes _ when it pertains to giving up
smoking _ a little foaming of the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to talk about rage? Nothing gets to me like kicking
that dirty habit,'' Gibson vents. ``And you never stop wanting one.
Never. It's enough to make you want to do something sick or
twisted.''
</P>
<P>
   Or make another movie. Look for Gibson's withdrawal agony (ITAL)
(Give me back my smokes!!!) (UNITAL) right up there on the big
screen, coming soon to a theater near you.

PAPAL INTERFERENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF JACOBY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because the pope asked him to, Missouri Governor Mel Carnahan
spared the life of triple murderer Darrell Mease, who was scheduled
to die by lethal injection. It is fair to wonder: What other papal
wishes would Carnahan grant?
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Mease ambushed Lloyd Lawrence, his former partner in a
drug-making operation. He waited in a hunting blind with a 12-gauge
shotgun, opening fire when Lawrence and his family drove by. Not
content with murdering just his ex-partner, Mease also killed
Lawrence's 56-year-old wife, Frankie, and their disabled grandson,
William.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes Mease's guilt. He was convicted in 1990 and the
execution was to finally take place this month. But on Jan. 27,
Pope John Paul II visited St. Louis, and Carnahan attended his
prayer service at the Cathedral Basilica. When the service ended,
the pope paused to speak with the governor. ``Have mercy on Mr.
Mease,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That, apparently, was all it took. Carnahan announced the next
day that he was commuting Mease's sentence to life imprisonment.
His explanation, more or less, was that the pope's attention left
him giddy. ``It was a very moving moment for me,'' he burbled to
reporters. ``It's one of those moments one would never expect to
happen in one's life. I would never expect it to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if it does? What if the pope phones Carnahan next week
to plead for the life of murderer James Rodden, who is scheduled to
die on Feb. 24?
</P>
<P>
   Will Carnahan again thrill to a ``very moving moment'' and agree
to treat the brutal slaying of an innocent human being as something
that can be wiped clean with a mere prison sentence? On what
grounds could he refuse to extend clemency to another death row
inmate, having already done so once?
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, what else would Carnahan do for the pope?
If His Holiness had asked the governor to commute a rapist's
sentence, would he have agreed? What if the pope had begged him to
shut down an abortion clinic? Or to speak out against gay rights?
</P>
<P>
   And are there other religious figures whose requests Carnahan is
willing to honor? It can't be the pope's Catholicism that so
affected the governor; Carnahan isn't Catholic. How would he react
to an appeal from the archbishop of Canterbury? The chief rabbi of
Israel? The president of the Mormon Church?
</P>
<P>
   These are not idle queries _ not when an elected American
governor is overturning a jury verdict and frustrating justice at
the behest of a religious leader. It is one thing to believe, as I
do, that religious values are vital to a democracy. It is something
very different when gubernatorial power is deployed to please a
churchman who doesn't like the way a criminal case turned out.
</P>
<P>
   It is a shame that Carnahan was more moved by the pope's desire
to keep a murderer alive than by the law's demand that the murderer
die. The pope is a man of great holiness and integrity. But his
crusade against capital punishment contradicts not just America's
legal tradition, but Judeo-Christian teaching.
</P>
<P>
   I grant that it takes a measure of chutzpah to debate theology
with the pope. Yet it is clear (to me, anyway) that on this issue,
the pope is wrong _ theologically wrong.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's views on the death penalty are set out in his 1995
encyclical ``Evangelium Vitae'' (The Gospel of Life). That message
focuses on abortion and euthanasia; the death penalty is treated in
just a few paragraphs. But those paragraphs are weakly argued and
rely upon a highly selective reading of Scripture.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the encyclical quotes Genesis 9:5 and the second
half of Genesis 9:6 _ God's first commandment after the Flood, as
Noah begins to recreate human society. ``For your own lifeblood I
will demand an accounting,'' God warns. ``From man in regard to his
fellow man I will demand an accounting for human life. . . . For in
the image of God was man created.''
</P>
<P>
   What is left out is the first half of Verse 6. And no wonder _
it makes clear that not only is capital punishment not condemned by
God, it is required. The verse reads, ``Whoever sheds the blood of
man, (itals)by man shall his blood be shed,(unitals) for in the
image of God was man created.''
</P>
<P>
   So insistent is the Bible that the punishment for murder is
death that it says so four times: in Exodus 21, Leviticus 24,
Numbers 35, and Deuteronomy 19. The New Testament never repudiates
the death penalty, and several times implies support for it. In
Acts 25, for example, Paul tells Festus, ``If I am guilty of any
crime, I do not ask to escape the death penalty'' _ hardly what the
apostle would be expected to say if the death penalty is always
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Carnahan should have argued the theology of capital
punishment. He should have listened to the pope politely, then
allowed Mease's execution to go forward. Not for religious reasons;
quite the contrary. American law respects, but does not defer to
religion. If Carnahan wants a text to study, I would suggest _ no,
not Genesis _ John F. Kennedy's 1960 address to the ministers of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic,
Protestant, nor Jewish,'' JFK said, ``where no public official
either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the
pope, the National Council of Churches, or any other ecclesiastical
source, (and) where no religious body seeks to impose its will
directly or indirectly upon . . . the public acts of its
officials.''

NEW POLITICS OF ABORTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the least attractive features of right-wing politics is
its persistent demonization of homosexuals. Most gay men and women
live dual lives; one within the mainstream culture and one apart
from it. Belonging and not belonging is not easy. Making it harder
is, at some level, morally reprehensible, especially so when
right-wingers cast their aspersions in moral terms.
</P>
<P>
   In July of 1993, Dean Hamer of the National Institute of Health
published an influential paper announcing the discovery of the
``gay gene.'' By the year 2001, the mapping of the human genome
will be complete and work can begin to either confirm or disprove
Hamer's discovery. Because of the enormous computing power of
modern microprocessors, this inquiry may produce definitive results
before the end of the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   It seems likely, based on the data gathered so far, that
homosexuality is indeed genetically determined. If it is, then
questions of motive are irrelevant. As Tom Wolfe wrote in Forbes
ASAP a few years back: ``if homosexuality is a genetically
determined trait, like left-handedness or hazel eyes, then laws and
sanctions against it are attempts to legislate against Nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Harvard University announced that it would invest
$150 to $200 million in the sciences that may provide us with
definitive answers to these and other questions of human behavior.
As the Globe's Adam Pertman reported, $70 million has already been
allocated to the Center for Genomics and Proteomics (the study of
genes and their proteins) and the Center for Imaging and Mesoscale
Materials (nannotechnology). The remaining millions will be spent
on neuro-scientific research. The goal is to bring together
academics and scholars from every discipline to re-examine human
behavior in the light of genomics-based research.
</P>
<P>
   Genomics is both exciting and terrifying. As Claire Fraser, a
leading scientist in this field, told Juan Enriquez of Harvard's
Center for Genomics Research, genomics represents a revolution in
human understanding. ``In the next 10 years we will see some of the
most extraordinary discoveries in the history of science . . . We
can either give evolution a shove in the right direction or in the
wrong direction, depending on whether we know what we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, it may soon be possible to accurately predict what
kind of life a child might have based on his or her genetic code. A
DNA sample can be acquired in the first moments of life This sample
could then be immediately analyzed on a DNA chip. The results could
inform the parents what ``traits'' are embedded in their child's
genetic code. Decision trees regarding that child's development
could then be built to help him or her live a happier, healthier
life. That's a wonderful promise and an extraordinary opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also terrifying, because the same DNA sample can be
acquired from a fetus. Imagine for a moment that the parents learn
that the fetus will grow up to be homosexual and that, for whatever
reason, the parents decide that homsexuality is not what they want
for their child. The decision to abort is available to them and
they make that choice. There is terror in that.
</P>
<P>
   The antiabortion movement has long argued that abortion is
murder by another name. This view has been derided by the
mainstream culture as both ignorant and hysterical. Adopting
marketing jargon, pro-abortion advocates have recast the decision
to terminate pregnancies as an issue of ``choice.'' In this effort,
they have been remarkably successful.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Wirthlin, who did polling on this issue for the Mormon
Church, found that the word ``choice'' (as in prochoice) defeated
the word ``life'' (as in pro-life) in focus groups by a margin of 2
to 1.
</P>
<P>
   What happens when the ``choice'' becomes an ``informed choice?''
Some parents already struggle with this issue after amniocentesis.
They abort babies that they are reasonably certain will have Down's
syndrome. It is hard for any morally sentient person to be
judgmental about that. What would you do, given the same set of
circumstances? The truth is that even the most morally enlightened
among us would think long and hard about aborting such a fetus.
</P>
<P>
   Genomics takes this quandary further, into unexplored moral
territory. It makes possible the abortion of homosexual fetuses. It
makes possible the abortion of fetuses that show a genetic
disposition to all manner of disease and disorder. Shortly after
the moment of conception, an outline of that child's life can and
will be known to all who care to know. And ``informed choices'' to
abort fetuses could become routine.
</P>
<P>
   It has been argued by some that the politics of abortion are
moot because of pharmaceutical technology. The exact opposite is
true. The science of genomics re-raises the abortion issue in its
starkest moral and political terms. How it is decided decides, in
very real terms, who we will be.

WHAT TO DO WHEN THE TOILET FLUSHES ALL BY ITSELF _ AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER C. HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Never let it be said that a house is maintenance free. It just
isn't so, no matter how many electronic gizmos you may have in it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little like the misbegotten claim that a perennial garden
is a no-maintenance garden. You know, those perennials, the ones
that keep coming back year after year; plant them once and forget
about them. That's not so, either. Anyone who has a perennial
garden will tell you, loud and clear, how much work it is.
</P>
<P>
   It's the same with the house. There's always something wrong.
Windows don't wash properly. Doors open and close by themselves,
and bind aginst the jamb as well. Toilets flush without human
help. &QL; 
 &QL; 
The ``thinking'' toilet &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the toilet with a mind of its own. It flushes all
by itself, usually in the middle of the night.
</P>
<P>
   The reason usually is that the flapper or rubber ball that sets
on the drain hole at the bottom of the tank, where water normally
goes into the bowl during a flush, does not seat properly in the
opening. A slow leak occurs, and the lower the water goes in the
tank the sooner the flapper pops up and the toilet flushes.
</P>
<P>
   A simple adjustment to move the flapper may be all that is
needed, to make sure the flapper or ball seats properly.
</P>
<P>
   Sometmes the flapper does not seat properly because the drain
opening is corroded, or has a mineral buildup on it. Smooth it out
by rubbing with emery cloth, a fine sanding and grinding substance.
</P>
<P>
   This did not work for one homeowner whose toilet just wouldn't
stop flushing when it felt like it. The flapper or ball was seating
properly, adding to the frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The homeowner looked long and hard at the innards of the tank,
until she noticed the little tube that fills the overflow tube
seemed quite low. She lifted it an inch or so and the spontaneous
flushing stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the filler tube was so low that it siphoned water
away, lowering the water in the tank, leading to the self-flush. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Windows don't come clean &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Consider dirty windows, so dirty or stained that nothing cleans
them.
</P>
<P>
   Last week we mentioned a super cleaner called ClearVue, which
might do the job on those impossible windows, but we did not know
where it was sold. Dr. Ed Rafferty of Lynn, Mass. took time out of
his busy schedule to tell us that ``every supermarket carries
ClearVue. I happened to pick some up from a jeweler.''
</P>
<P>
   It comes in a 24-ounce spray bottle, Rafferty said.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Ed Rafferty. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Door has a mind of its own &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a homeowner doesn't ``do'' windows, but he has to use
doors, and if they get out of adjustment or stick or simply refuse
to open or close properly, then he has to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   And here is what you can do.
</P>
<P>
   If the door sticks or binds, say, at the top corner on the latch
side, first check the hinges to make sure they are tight. Often a
loose hinge will let the door drop a bit, causing the bind. If a
hinge is loose, redrive the screws or fill the holes with
toothpicks, kitchen matches or other filler material so the screws
will tighten.
</P>
<P>
   Another material to fill the holes if a screw is loose (no pun
intended) is Mr. Grip, a thin strip of aluminum with little holes
punched in it, like a cheese grater. The barbs in these gripper
strips grab the screw tightly when it is driven. Mr. Grip; is sold
in many hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   If the hinges are tight, the bind may indicate that the door is
not quite vertical. To correct this, install shims (thin pieces of
cardboard) behind the leaf of the lowest hinge. Remove the hinge
leaf, insert the cardboard shim, and remount the leaf. This will
not correct a severe bind; if the door is really sticking, and in
more than one place, shave or plane the binding surfaces so it fits
properly. You may have to saw off a thin layer to make it work.
</P>
<P>
   Shimming behind the leaf of a hinge is also done when the door
swings of its own accord. You open it and it swings shut. You close
it and if it doesn't latch, it swings open. Sometimes you have to
shim the bottom hinge leaf rather than the top.
</P>
<P>
   Try it. It does, indeed, work. Some refrigerator doors are set
off-vertical on purpose, so when someone raids it, he doesn't have
to close the door; it will close by itself. That's OK for a
refrigerator, but not for a bedroom or bathroom door.

MONICA'S STORY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For refusing to admit that she and the president
engaged several times in oral sex, Monica Lewinsky was threatened
by the federal government with prison and made to testify more than
20 times _ most recently this week before all-male members of
Congress and a videocamera.
</P>
<P>
   Her privacy has been invaded in a manner unmatched in U.S.
history, and she's been robbed of a life for the last 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Does the punishment fit her crime? It's useful to go back to the
beginning and take a look at Lewinsky's sworn affidavit to Paula
Jones' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   You remember the affidavit? The one she submitted in December
1997, the first time she (drum roll) perrr-jured herself? On a
purely technical level, yes, it's full of lies. The biggest leads
off Item No. 8: ``I have never had a sexual relationship with the
president. ...''
</P>
<P>
   We know that Lewinsky, Bill Clinton and the majority of the U.S.
college students who were queried in an 8-year-old Kinsey survey do
not consider oral sex actual ``sex.'' We also know that Lewinsky
and the president engaged in enough of the former to satisfy the
definition of the latter for millions of Americans _ including
Congress and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   (That the pair's activities may not have satisfied the tortured
definition of ``sexual relations'' agreed to by Jones' attorneys
explains a lot of why we're all now stuck watching ``Capitol Hill
90210.'')
</P>
<P>
   A smaller lie pops up further along in Item 8: ``The occasions
that I saw the president after I left my employment at the White
House in April 1996 were official receptions, formal functions or
events related to the U.S. Department of Defense, where I was
working at the time. There were other people present on those
occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   As we now know, after she left her job at the White House,
Lewinsky and the president actually saw each other at their own
private functions.
</P>
<P>
   Item No.3 is a tricky one: ``I cannot fathom any reason that the
plaintiff would seek information from me for her case.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lie, right? Except, taken from the standpoint of sexual
harassment law, Lewinsky really did not possess any information
that would be of use to a woman making such a claim against
Clinton. Lewinsky's non-sexual sexual relations with the
commander-in-chief were not only consensual, they were her idea.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, when she addressed the heart of the Jones case (also Item
8), she told nothing but the truth: ``(The president) did not
propose that we have a sexual relationship; he did not offer me
employment or other benefits in exchange for a sexual relationship;
he did not deny me employment or other benefits for rejecting a
sexual relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know of any other person who had a sexual
relationship with the president, was offered employment or other
benefits in exchange for a sexual relationship, or was denied
employment or other benefits for rejecting a sexual relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, though we may never know why Lewinsky and
Clinton lied about their consensual non-sexual sexual relationship,
their truth had nothing to do with sexual harassment; their lies
did not subvert any legal process or deny Paula Corbin Jones her
civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   According to the inevitable leaks that sprang right after
Lewinsky's ``confidential'' testimony on Monday, one of the
president's lawyers read an apology to her from her one-time
sort-of lover. He's sorry ``for all the trouble the investigation
and impeachment trial had caused her.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes Item No. 7 in Lewinsky's affidavit all the more
poignant. It may be a lie for some folks _ it may be untrue for her
now _ but it wasn't the day she swore: ``I have the utmost respect
for the president, who has always behaved appropriately in my
presence.''

DAVID DUVAL'S SHADES OF GREATNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Everyone has their own label for him now.
Best golfer. Robot. Mystery Man.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants to pick away at the man behind those wraparound
sunglasses, to penetrate this inscrutable performer who can be
shooting the best round in history, yet walk up the 18th fairway
and barely crack a smile, as was the case when he turned the final
round of the Bob Hope Classic into a milestone by shooting a 59 _
on national television.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when you have won nine times in your last 29
tournaments, when it's just past Groundhog Day and your earnings
are already above $1 million for the year.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happens when you shoot 26 under par in back-to-back
tournaments, a performance so overwhelming that Tiger Woods
jokingly says he wants a shot a side in your next match.
</P>
<P>
   So it is only natural that David Duval is out here this week at
the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am dealing as much with the
media as with the golf courses he hopes to tame by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   You want to know about David Duval? Who he is? What he is?
</P>
<P>
   Take a look.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `I was at the NHL All-Star Game in Tampa with my son,'' recalls
Mark O'Meara, who with victories in two majors last season and five
career wins at Pebble Beach knows something about good golf. ``I
went up to Fox's press box, and somebody said, `Someone shot a 59.'
I said, `Yeah, right.' They said, `No, we think it was Duval.' I
said, `No, wait a minute, wait a minute. I know he's playing good.
But a 59 on that course?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Couple that with Duval's victory in Hawaii at the Mercedes
Championship a week earlier, in which he carded his first
astounding 26-under aggregate, a 266, and you have something that
defies explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know how good he is,'' says O'Meara. ``But what David
has done is pretty much beyond belief.''
</P>
<P>
   On that Duval is in agreement. In coming from seven strokes back
in the fifth and final round to win the Hope by a stroke with
another 26-under total (334) _ and tie the PGA Tour record for
lowest round _ he had 11 birdie putts, six from 3 feet or fewer.
The putt he rolled in for the eagle on the par-5 18th that gave him
the 59 was 12 feet.
</P>
<P>
   He says his impassive look coming up to the green on 18 was
dictated more by surprise at what he was doing than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a case of `What have I done to deserve this?' '' Duval
says. ``The best way to answer how I can grasp what happened is
that I can't grasp what happened. I don't appreciate what happened.
I've gotten to appreciate it a little more. But it's just so hard
to describe. It's so hard to do, you don't expect to do it. It's
just not something that entered my mind. All of a sudden, it's
over, you did it. And you ask yourself, `What just happened?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It might be the only chance I really have to do it. To be able
to make that putt is, I guess in that circumstance, almost
surprising. To just think of the course of 40 or 50 years, it might
be the only time it happens. The odds are so stacked against you,
it will be something I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Duval, only Al Geiberger (1977 Memphis Classic) and
Chip Beck (1991 Las Vegas Invitational) had carded 59s in Tour
competition.
</P>
<P>
   But neither of those came in the final round and neither came
without the aid of some remarkable shots around the green _
extraordinary long putts or chip-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Each day Duval says he understands more about what he did, if
not how he did it.
</P>
<P>
   When someone asks him if he has the golf ball from that round,
he smiles. ``Oh, yeah,'' he says. ``Hidden away in my house (in
Ponte Vedra, Fla.).''
</P>
<P>
   Duval says the significance of making that final putt was not
necessarily that it gave him the 59 but that it proved he could
handle pressure with a tournament on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 59 is not going to do anything for me when you need to win
at Augusta, he says. ``If I face a situation to make a reasonable
putt to win a golf tournament, I can go back and draw on the putt I
made to shoot a 59.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duval knows he is different now. Or viewed differently. Until
the Hope, he was a rising star on the PGA Tour, but one of many,
and still a step behind Woods.
</P>
<P>
   He came out of Georgia Tech in 1993 with ambitions of being
better than his father, Bob, who is now on the PGA Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   David had been a Collegiate Player of the Year, a four-time
Division 1 All-American. His first stop was the Nike Tour in 1993,
where he won twice. He struggled for two years, finishing 201st on
the PGA money list in 1993 and 195th in 1994, earning a combined
total of $71,000 in a handful of PGA events.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he made the quantum leap to a full-time spot on the PGA
Tour, jumping to 11th in earnings with $881,436. The only thing
missing was a victory. He had seven seconds and four thirds, and
everyone knew he was an emerging force _ except on Sundays, when
tournaments are won or lost.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two years, all that has changed. Instead of saying
he couldn't win, Duval has had a tough time not winning.
</P>
<P>
   He won three times at the end of 1997, followed up last year
with four wins and four seconds, and has already won twice this
season.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, he is beyond hot. Over the last 16 months, he has won
almost a third of the tournaments he has entered. O'Meara thinks he
could win four or five more times this season, which likely would
put him above the $3 million mark in earnings, not an unreasonable
assumption since he will play in another 15-17 events. One thing,
though _ O'Meara thinks Duval can reach that total by the US Open
in June.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part, says Duval, who has shot a course-record-tying
62 at Pebble Beach, is dealing with all the things away from the
course, the looks he gets when he plays, the whispers he hears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy it,'' he says. ``It's an adjustment. For the most
part, everyone understands and has been supportive. I try and be
accommodating as far as autographs. There's not going to be a lot
of interaction on the golf course. And sometimes I have bad days.
That's just how it is. Hopefully, I don't offend those people too
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, there's a rivalry brewing with Woods, although
both players say they worry about themselves, not anybody else.
``What you want to do out here is prove you're better than any
other player,'' says Woods. ``David has been doing that. He's been
killing us.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara sees Duval and the way he handles the attention and
merely shrugs. ``His personality is his personality,'' says
O'Meara, who nosed out Duval for 1998 Player of the Year honors by
virtue of his wins in the Masters and British Open. ``And he's not
going to change that. And you have to admire a guy that's that way.
He goes along and does his business and does it quite well. I mean,
I don't think anything is distracting David Duval right now. His
game shows that.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval agrees. His personality is his personality. The man on the
golf course, behind the sunglasses, is different than the David
Duval you will find on the street or joking around with his buddies
on the Tour, such as Phil Mickelson and Fred Funk.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the sunglasses, those wraparound protective shields
that hide his eyes and, some contend, his soul as well.
</P>
<P>
   When he started on the Tour, Duval was 40 pounds heavier, had a
goatee, and wore the sunglasses that revealed nothing to the public
watching him. He was, he said, ``just another blond-haired,
blue-eyed, stereotypical PGA golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   The pounds and the goatee are gone, but the sunglasses remain.
He wears them because he wants to, not because he needs to. He says
they allow him to focus on the course, to zone in on what he must
do.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about his aloof persona on the course and some bells go
off in his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm very approachable,'' he says almost defensively.
``I think I'm as accommodating as anyone in the game. I don't know
what else I can do. I don't know what I can do about that, so I
don't think about that. I don't worry about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ask him about his reaction _ that seemingly muted reaction _
after he made that putt for the 59 and Duval will reveal more of
his personality. ``I might have done a few laps if there wasn't a
group behind me,'' he says with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Now Duval must live with what he has created. He says, ``No
problem.'' He will continue to wear the sunglasses, continue to
play golf on his terms. Duval says he still gets uncomfortable when
he is called a superstar or the best player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he acknowledges that despite the rankings which still list
Woods as No. 1, he should occupy that perch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how to play,'' he says. ``It's been a lot of hard work,
and I think I'm pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't bother with comparisons to Woods. ``I just go out
there and do my job,'' he says. ``If I'm on the leaderboard and
he's up there, I'll know what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   His schedule for the year is pretty much laid out. He will play
fairly steadily through May, then reassess where he wants to go.
The majors _ beginning with the Masters in April _ are paramount.
</P>
<P>
   Asked which would be most special if he does capture a major, he
doesn't hesitate. ``The US Open,'' he says. ``It's our
championship. And besides, everyone always complains about the
courses. It's funny to hear the best players in the world sound
like a bunch of old women, complaining about everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval has few complaints these days, although he dislikes match
play, which he will experience in San Diego later this month at a
world championship event and during the Ryder Cup matches at The
Country Club in Brookline, Mass., in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never get what you deserve in match play,'' he says. ``The
No. 1 player might shoot six shots better than the No. 3 player and
the No. 3 player might play a round in 3 over and win, and that's
not right.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's being picky. Right now David Duval feels he can do
anything on a golf course. Some people say he is in that magical
area known as ``the zone.''
</P>
<P>
   It's more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe fellow touring pro Scott Simpson's assessment is more
accurate:
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's really good.''
</P>
<P>

DUVAL ON A ROLL &QL; 
(! used as column separator) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Before he broke through for his first PGA Tour win in October 1997,
David Duval was considered another very good player who had not
won. How times have changed. In the last 16 months, Duval has been
on fire and is generally regarded as the No. 1 player in the world.
That honor officially belongs to Tiger Woods, but just compare the
numbers for the two young stars since Duval's first win: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Duval! Woods &QL; 
Tournaments ! 29! 29 &QL; 
Wins ! 9! 1 &QL; 
Top 10's ! 18! 16 &QL; 
Money ! $4,967,031!$2,166,930 &QL;

`STAR WARS' PREQUEL BRINGS `FANBOYS' OUT IN FULL FORCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATTI HARTIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They may live in a parallel universe, but they're fun-loving
sorts, peaceful fellows. They fantasize about alien adventures, but
they're really quite down-to-earth. So one of them goes over to the
Dark Side every now and then, wearing his Vader regalia in public.
What of it? So another chap wants to play his favorite movie in the
delivery room when his wife gives birth to their first _ as yet
unconceived _ child. No big deal.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about the ``fanboys,'' the closely knit group of
``Star Wars'' fanatics who spend hours and hours scouring the globe
for tidbits about the upcoming ``prequel'' to the George Lucas
adventure series, which will be released May 21. They're obsessive,
they're tenacious, they're devoted to the cause. And, to say the
least, these fanboys are wired.
</P>
<P>
   They seem to soak up radiation from their computer screens the
way certain sun worshippers lap up ultraviolet rays. Consider: Late
one evening, a mainstream reporter sent e-mail to one of the most
popular sites, www.theforce.net. Within a few minutes, two Web
masters called back, and within five minutes, four messages popped
in from four states. Let the force be with you? The force is
everywhere, just waiting to strike back.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the trailer for the prequel hit movie screens in
November, the ``Star Wars'' Web sites have been rushed with the
kind of urgent traffic you might expect from crowds racing to
catch, say, the last flight out of Saigon. There are thousands of
unofficial fan sites, and a half-dozen of them receive more than
15,000 hits a day. Every day, these sites post new tidbits about
the prequel and the Skywalk convention in Dallas that will coincide
with the release of the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lets me nurture my obsession,'' says Brian Linder, a
23-year-old network systems engineer and a Forcenet driving force
from Columbia, S.C., who wins the award for the fastest fanboy to
respond to e-mail. Linder, like most of the other Jedi junkies, was
fascinated by the series as a child, attracted by the
``multicultural, multinational'' cast of characters and by the
Joseph Campbell-style mythological themes. Sure, some of his
friends think he's a bit out there. He dragged his girlfriend to
see the trailer four times, but she's learned to understand. ``But
my roommate likes to bust my chops,'' he says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Lou ``T-Bone'' Tambone, a Web master for www.starwarz.com who
lives in Watertown, has a sympathetic spouse: They got married on
May 25, 1997, the 20th anniversary of the release of the first
``Star Wars'' film. Their wedding cake was graced with Han Solo and
Leia figurines, and they marched into their reception to the
adventurous strains of the John Williams theme.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of these networked fans, Tambone, 28, has a sense of
humor about the current craze. ``Some guys think it's their
responsibility to inform the world about every little thing that
every `Star Wars' person does, like `Jake Lloyd (the 8-year-old boy
who plays young Darth Vader in the prequel) scratched his head
today,' '' he says. ``OK, that's obsessive.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, it sure is. The Web world is populated by fanatics. A
Catholic priest in the Netherlands, one Roderick Vonhogen, has put
together a detailed plot synopsis of the prequel, his fellow
fanboys say. John Benson, a Forcenet fanboy who works for IBM in
Atlanta and who can recite android trivia like a missionary quoting
scripture, spent $1,200 on a Darth Vader costume. He and his wife,
Georgie, are planning to have children and he is trying to persuade
her to let him watch the films _ ``or at least play the music'' _
in the delivery room.
</P>
<P>
   The fans are linked together electronically, but their obsession
can be a hindrance to close encounters in the flesh world. ``I'm
not married, and I'm not sure it's been helping my social life,''
says Forcenet staffer Steve Head, a Weymouth resident who works for
a South Shore real estate firm. Given the ratio of 20 fanboys to
every fangirl, it seems as if someone should come up with a
Starmate service, an electronic dating venture of the intergalactic
kind.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other Internet fan groups, these folks are not
competitive or cutthroat about their endeavors, and for the most
part, Lucasfilms hasn't struck back at the fans for posting images
and inside information. (The production company has issued a few
cease-and-desist orders to sites that sell ``Star Wars''
memorabilia, but they'd be crazy to alienate their alien-obsessed
fans.) There is a peaceful, almost childlike quality about them,
which is perhaps what the whole thing is all about. It's about
escape, entering a universe where good conquers evil and the heroes
get the best costumes. ``I'm a Han Solo guy: He has that cool vest
thing going,'' says Tambone about the character immortalized by
Harrison Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the fanboys pause and search for words when asked to
define the appeal, to explain why they spend up to 50 hours a week
on line updating their sites. But Tambone cuts to the chase. ``When
I was 7, my parents were going to get divorced,'' he recalls
wistfully, sounding a bit like Princess Leia in the 1977 classic.
Obi Wan Kenobi, you're my only hope. ``When you're little, your
parents try to keep it from you, but I needed a place to keep the
pain away. `Star Wars' was in full force, and it became a safe
place, a hideaway. I grew attached to it. It distracted me from the
real world.''

HOTLINE'S COOL RECEPTION COSTS TAXPAYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRUCE MOHL  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts is running a toll-free hotline on
electricity deregulation that is costing taxpayers a fortune while
attracting only a handful of calls from consumers each day.
</P>
<P>
   Through the hotline's first 10 months of operation, the state
paid Compaq Computer Corp. more than $746,000 to run it. Over that
10-month period, the hotline received 14,600 calls, which works out
to an average cost of $51 a call.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to the hotline hit a peak of 3,568 during May, when the
state launched a TV and radio advertising campaign promoting the
hotline and electricity deregulation. The call volume has steadily
dropped since then, hitting a low of 264 in December, an average of
about 12 calls each business day.
</P>
<P>
   As the call volume has dwindled, state officials have scaled
back the hotline's hours, reduced the number of operators from 10
to two, and renegotiated the contract several times with Compaq.
But state officials haven't been able to fix the hotline's biggest
problem _ the absence of electricity competition.
</P>
<P>
   The state's electricity business was officially deregulated last
March, but because market-level prices are being phased in,
companies haven't started competing yet for residential customers.
As a result, nearly everyone is still buying electricity the same
way they always have _ from their local utility.
</P>
<P>
   This status quo situation hasn't generated the type of confusion
the hotline was intended to handle. According to hot-line reports,
callers are asking general questions about their local utilities,
their monthly bills, and how competition will work. When they ask
for a list of companies from which they can buy power, they learn
that four companies are licensed to sell power to residential
customers but aren't doing it yet.
</P>
<P>
   The state had expected calls to last 10 to 12 minutes on
average, but a spokeswoman for Compaq said calls are lasting an
average of two to three minutes. A state official said the average
call length rises to five minutes when the time it takes to log the
call and mail out a state guide to deregulation is included.
Hot-line operators are temporary workers hired by Compaq and
trained by the state.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Sargent of the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group,
a critic of the state's deregulation law, said the lack of
electricity competition means the hotline is attempting to answer
consumer questions before consumers are ready to ask them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's outrageous that we have a consumer hotline that
is charging taxpayers $50 a call. At that rate, you should be
talking to the top utility experts in the country, but instead
people are talking to someone who is basically reading a script,''
Sargent said.
</P>
<P>
   David O'Connor, head of the state's Division of Energy
Resources, which oversees the hotline, predicted call volume would
pick up over the next several months as competition among companies
for residential customers begins in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal has always been to be slightly ahead of the market,''
O'Connor said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor's agency is planning to promote the hotline again in
March in advertisements on billboards, buses, and trains. Most
utilities print the hot-line number in their bills.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Daniel Bosley, a Democrat from North Adams who
played a key role in drafting the deregulation law, said the
hotline and consumer education campaign were high priorities of
lawmakers. He said there was mass confusion about deregulation in
California when regulators there failed to set aside enough money
for an education campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bosley acknowledged the hotline won't get really busy until
consumers start getting calls at dinner time from electricity
marketers. But he said those annoying calls may be coming, noting
that several retailers have told him they plan to start competing
for customers in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Admittedly, we're ahead of ourselves,'' Bosley said. ``But
even if we're ahead of the curve, we needed this. It's seed
money.''
</P>
<P>
   The hotline opened for business at the end of February. Compaq
was awarded the hot-line contract under an abbreviated state
bidding process for ``deals too good to pass up,'' under state
contracting guidelines. Compaq was seen as a good fit for the
hotline because the company was already operating a technology
hotline for state workers.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq hired temporary workers to answer calls at a facility in
Shrewsbury and the state trained them on the details of
deregulation. The state agreed to pay a fee for each call handled,
but Compaq was guaranteed a set amount of money each day based on
an agreed-upon minimum number of calls.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, that minimum was 70 calls at $26.97 apiece, or a
total of $1,888. Calls after the initial 70 would be priced at
$15.75 apiece. The per-call price was scheduled to drop as daily
call volume increased.
</P>
<P>
   But as calls proved to be shorter and call volume declined, the
contract was revised. In September, weekend hours were eliminated,
the number of operators was reduced to four, and the price per call
for the initial 70 calls was reduced to $25.83.
</P>
<P>
   But call volume continued to decline so the contract was revised
again last month. Only two operators are working now and the
minimum daily call volume was reduced to 35 at a price of $26.83 a
call. That means the state will pay 48 percent less if the
operators handle 35 calls or less a day. Calls in excess of 35 are
priced at $15.75 apiece.

COOL CAMELLIAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CAROL STOCKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Their brilliant satin petals bursting from
swollen green buds, the camellias at the historic Lyman Estate
greenhouse seem as miraculous as an early spring. Camellias have a
hopeful vivacity that has won the protective patronage of both the
Buddhist priests who first collected and bred them for ancient
temple gardens in China and the Western aristocrats who 1,000 years
later built Victorian ``camellia houses'' to display these tender
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   If the best thing about camellias is the way they seem to laugh
at winter, the worst is that they must do it behind walls of glass.
Even their lack of hardiness here has a silver lining, however, for
it creates a good reason to visit the Lyman greenhouse, where
thousands of plants thrive in moist and warm air. West Coast
trendies may be hooking up to oxygen tanks in spa lounges, but New
Englanders only need visit a greenhouse in February to feel
buoyant.
</P>
<P>
   You may not have seen a camellia, but you've certainly heard the
name. These are fabled flowers. Naturally occurring in China and
Japan in shades of pink, red, and white, camellias originally
followed in the path of the Buddha, dispersed by traveling monks
who had bred them to assume different forms. There are so-called
peony camellias, anemone camellias, singles, and doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Because camellias were popular with the Victorians, they have
been immortalized in music and literature as a symbol of tragic
romanticism. Who could forget French courtesan Greta Garbo as the
dying Lady of the Camellias?
</P>
<P>
   In the Old South, this favorite of pre-Civil War plantations
like Charleston's Middleton Place soaked up the ``Gone With the
Wind'' mystique of lost gentility.
</P>
<P>
   In the more button-down North, camellias were also treasured,
but symbolized something different: trade with China, and its
attendant wealth and status.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that camellias were first mistakenly imported as
tea plants when Chinese merchants, intent on protecting their
export markets, pulled a fast one, selling European traders the
ornamental in place of its sought-after cousin, the tea bush
Camellia sinensis, said Lynn Ackerman, managing horticulturalist at
the Lyman Estate.
</P>
<P>
   But they still caught on. And how.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Lyman made a fortune in the China Trade and copied the
stately country seats of England when he built the estate he named
the Vale in the 1790s. He also loved plants and in 1800 began the
oldest-surviving greenhouse complex in the United States, which the
family added onto through the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1840 one room of that greenhouse was heightened and deepened
to become a separate camellia house, as these bushes require cooler
temperatures than most greenhouse plants.
</P>
<P>
   For five generations the Vale was the Lyman family's summer
home. Gardeners would cut camellias through the winter and deliver
them to the family's townhouse on Beacon Hill, where they were
proudly displayed in imported China Trade vases.
</P>
<P>
   The favorite classic ``formal double'' possesses a well-bred
symmetry that appealed to French designer Coco Chanel, who was
doubtless aware of the plant's aristocratic associations. Cloth
camellias still decorate Chanel accessories.
</P>
<P>
   Like fashion, however, real flowers suffered the peaks and
valleys of a popular craze, and eventually most flower fanciers had
discarded their camellia collections for newer plants. Besides,
camellias are tricky to grow. Central heating is death to them. As
Ackerman put it, ``If your camellias are comfortable, it's probably
too cool for you. And if you're comfortable, it's probably too warm
for your camellias.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the Lyman estate remained devoted to its camellia
collection, even after the property was donated to the Society for
the Preservation of New England Antiquities in the 1950s. Today the
camellia house contains 13 original plants the size of small
dogwood trees and several dozen younger specimens. A few sweet
olive plants scent the sunny lean-to to provide the fragrance most
camellias lack. An exception is Camellia lutchensis, whose smallish
white flower exudes an intense sweetness. The bushes bloom against
a 20-foot-high red brick wall that retains splashes of milky white
from when it was originally painted with a lime wash to reflect
light and warmth.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The greenhouse sells a few Florida-grown camellia plants at $15
to $25. Ackerman said she has had good luck with them in an
unheated room of her own home, but unless you have a greenhouse you
are well advised to invest your money in the many orchids the
greenhouse also sells, and enjoy camellias at the Vale.
</P>
<P>
   With the population shift to the Sun Belt, camellias have gained
popularity among those who can grow them outdoors year-round,
however, and you'll find them gracing many a tract-house lawn in
California, trying to maintain their dignity. Sacramento even
dubbed itself ``Camellia City.''
</P>
<P>
   Camellias can grow outdoors in some sheltered spots on Cape Cod
and the Islands. The new Polly Hill Arboretum on Martha's Vineyard
has a few.
</P>
<P>
   Among the newer, more cold-hardy varieties to try if you are a
neighbor to the south are Nicky Crisp and Donation. Both are
Camellia x williamsii hybrids available from Heronswood Nursery in
Kingston, Wash. (360-297-4172, www.heronswood.com), and both are
relatively fast-growing and self-cleaning (meaning they drop their
ugly brown spent blossoms), traits the old-fashioned C. japonica
unfortunately lacks. For more information, contact the American
Camellia Society at 912-967-2358.
</P>
<P>
   The Lyman greenhouse offers many other treats in its several
rooms, including blooming bougainvillea and orchids, fragrant
rosemary, and of course a gift shop. There's also an antique marble
statue of dancing cherubs and a yellow-eyed black angora cat to
greet visitors. Once a stray, the feline now catnaps in sunny
splendor but is banned from the camellia house when nesting
cardinals take up spring residence there.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of historic greenhouses visiting the Lyman will be
heartened to see how this one has come back to life. With the aid
of full-time assistant Nancy Askin, Ackerman has in her 10 years on
the site helped convert a white elephant into an enchanted kingdom
that is just shy of being self-supporting through its plant sales,
including a well-attended Mother's Day weekend herb sale and a
shade plant and hosta sale a month later. Ackerman teaches several
plant workshops, including one in April on growing orchids in the
historic mansion, closed now except for tours or weddings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 10,000 visitors a year, the once-sleepy
greenhouse has gotten so busy that starting last year Ackerman
extended what has been a four-day ``camellia festival'' into a
monthlong ``camellia blooming period.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more relaxed having it over a longer period,'' said
Ackerman. ``Strolling through a greenhouse should be a leisurely
experience. This way we only get 50 or 75 people a day.''
</P>
<P>
   A $37,000 grant from the Massachusetts Historical Commission
allowed the thick glass panes to be replaced, many with glass from
another antique greenhouse recently bulldozed for development in
Milton, said Ackerman. ``But the mullions here were made out of
such good materials, cypress and redwood, that we had to replace
remarkably few.''
</P>
<P>
   The SPNEA, which owns 34 other historic properties, recently
created the post of director of landscapes, reflecting its
commitment to period gardens. In this role, Betsy Igleheart has
secured a historical commission grant for $75,000 to restore the
421-foot brick ``peach wall,'' which defines the property's outdoor
perennial beds and was once used for espalier fruit trees.
</P>
<P>
   The future is suddenly looking brighter for historic landscapes,
which means that camellias will once again get to tell their story.
</P>
<P>
   The Lyman greenhouse is open Mondays through Saturdays from 9
a.m. to 4 p.m. Admission is free.

SPANKING'S PUNISHING LESSONS 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although a proposed anti-spanking campaign for Oakland, Calif.,
is not expected to pass when the full City Council considers it
later this month, the proponents of the non-binding ``No Spanking
Zone'' should at least be applauded for their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   For years, parent educators and psychologists have been saying
that spanking is the least effective way to discipline children,
yet their advice is widely ignored: 94 percent of American parents
spank their 1- to 5-year-old children, according to a 1995 Gallup
Survey of Parenting in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spanking continues to be a mainstay of tactics used by
parents,'' says Murray Strauss, one of the nation's leading
researchers on spanking and co-director of the Family Research Lab
at the University of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   It's no suprise, then, that the Oakland proposal has been
controversial, even though all it would do is mandate ``No Spanking
Zone'' signs in public places. But despite the dire, indeed
shocking, statistics, parent educators see signs of hope.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Linda Braun, director of Families First
Parenting Programs in Cambridge, Mass., got a frantic call from a
father.
</P>
<P>
   There had been a struggle that morning as his 5-year-old son
left for kindergarten. The boy, already in the car pool van, wanted
to go back inside for something he had forgotten. The father,
anxious not to keep the driver waiting and also to teach his son to
plan better, said no. Frustrated and enraged, the son spat at his
father out of the open car door. Equally enraged, the father's
instinct was to haul his boy out of the car and give him the
spanking of his life. Instead, he gave in to a second instinct: He
turned his back and let the car pull away.
</P>
<P>
   Then he called Braun.
</P>
<P>
   ``He planned to go home and spank him that night. He felt he
shouldn't but he didn't know what else to do,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Therein lies the dilemma not just for this father but for all
parents who know spanking is wrong but do it nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't know what to do instead,'' says psychologist Roni
Leiderman, director of the Family Center at Nova Southeastern
University in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She says parents tend to repeat
the patterns of their own parents: If you were spanked as a child,
you are more likely to spank your children.
</P>
<P>
   The argument against spanking is that parents are a child's most
important teachers. When we spank, the lessons we teach are not
only negative but also antisocial:
</P>
<P>
   --It's OK for big people to hurt little people;
</P>
<P>
   --It's OK to resolve conflict through force.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson they are not getting is how to control the impulse
that led to the behavior that got them in trouble in the first
place. In fact, a child who is spanked chronically, once a week or
more, is more likely to feel the need for revenge, not for remorse,
says parent educator and author Nancy Samalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``What gets a child to change his behavior is that he feels
badly, loves his parents, and wants to please them. A child who's
spanked only wants to get even,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Since a child has very limited ways to exert power, getting even
usually comes out in oppositional behavior that parents rarely
connect to the spanking: not eating, not doing homework, not going
to the bathroom. ``It's as if the child is saying, `I'll show you,
I have some power, too,' '' says Braun, who is also a professor at
Wheelock College Graduate School.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Parents who insist spanking works are only looking at short-term
results, says University of Tulsa psychologist Terry Luce, an
authority on the impact of aggression on children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may get immediate compliance, but it's because you're
instilling fear. That prompts a child to stop doing the behavior
while you are watching, or to do it in a way you won't find out
about, in order to avoid another spanking,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But to change his behavior so he doesn't do it at all only
happens when he internalizes why the behavior is wrong. That leaves
parents with a choice, says Luce: ``Do you want to stop the
behavior now, without regard to long-term consequences, or do you
want to stop it for good?''
</P>
<P>
   For many parents, getting away from spanking means coming to
grips with significant emotional baggage.
</P>
<P>
   Leiderman tells of a mother who came to her parenting class and
confessed she regularly spanked her children with a wooden spoon.
The spoon was the same one her grandparents had spanked her mother
with and her mother had used on her.

 UNDATED: ... used on her.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``She didn't want to perpetuate this family tradition, but she
felt (to do anything different) was a slap in the face to people
she loved,'' says Leiderman. It took her months to gain the courage
to tell her parents and grandparents, ``I appreciate what you did
for me, I love you, but for me there's going to be a different
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parents argue, ``I was spanked and I turned out OK.'' To
that, Leiderman's response is to ask simply, ``If there's an
alternative, wouldn't you want to try it?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The strategy she and others offer is summed up in one word:
exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're angry enough to hit or to scream something abusive,
you're out of control. That itself is frightening to a young
child,'' says Braun. She recommends using as few words as possible
to say how upset you are and then to leave the room. Insisting your
child leave _ ``Go to your room! I don't want to see you!'' _ often
puts you in a secondary power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better for you to go,'' says Braun. ``If a toddler or
preschooler follows you to the bathroom and bangs on the door
crying, just stay there until you have control again.''
</P>
<P>
   When you reunite, acknowledge the incident _ ``Wow! We were both
really upset, weren't we?'' _ but buy some time: ``We'll talk about
it later.'' Then resume your activity.
</P>
<P>
   With a child 5 or older, tell him as you leave: ``I'm too angry,
we're not understanding each other, and I need to leave the room,''
or, ``I can see you're furious and I am, too. We need to separate
to calm down.'' Don't say, ``I can't be with you.'' ``That's just
too hurtful to many children,'' says Braun.
</P>
<P>
   No matter what your child's age, when the time comes to initiate
a discussion, talk about:
</P>
<P>
   --What happened: ``When you left for school this morning, you
spat at me.''
</P>
<P>
   --How you both felt: ``You were frustrated I didn't let you get
out of the car, and I hated being spat at.''
</P>
<P>
   --What the rule/limit is: ``In our family, spitting isn't
allowed. Spitting is wrong.'' Be clear, simple, and firm.
</P>
<P>
   --How you're going to help him: ``We need to help you with two
things: getting organized for school so you don't forget anything
and remembering to never spit again.''
</P>
<P>
   --Consequences: ``I can't read to you tonight. I hope that will
help you remember how upsetting this was to me.'' With an older
child, brainstorm solutions or consequences together: ``This wasn't
OK. What do you think should be the consequence?''
</P>
<P>
   Samalin says that a consequence that removes you from an
intimate interaction, especially one a child enjoys, is more
powerful than we realize. ``Children care deeply about how we feel
about them, even teenagers,'' she says. She is the author of ``Love
and Anger: The Parental Dilemma'' (Penguin).
</P>
<P>
   For many parents, this strategy feels wimpy. Luce argues it's
not. ``You are not relinquishing control when you explain why a
behavior is wrong. Don't think punishment,'' he says, ``think
discipline and consequences. That's what leads to learning, which
leads to self-control.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Braun urges parents to plan from the start never to
spank, she says that if you find yourself spanking once or twice a
year, rather than berate yourself or justify it with a
``my-parents-spanked-me'' defense, ``Find someone you respect to
reflect on what happened and explore options.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether you are a rare spanker or a chronic one, Samalin has the
last word: ``The bottom line is, hitting hurts. If you love
someone, why would you want to `teach' them by hurting?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Parents who disagree about spanking typically make matters
worse in three ways: Children of all ages learn to manipulate each
parent to get what they want; parents focus more on the spanking
than on the behavior that caused it; over time, each parent becomes
more entrenched in his/her position. The parent who spanks thinks,
``She's such a marshmallow, I have to be the one to teach this
kid,'' and the parent who doesn't thinks, ``He's so strict, I have
to be kind and loving.'' The solution is for parents to talk calmly
about their positions, get information about them, and work to be
in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   --Parents whose anger gets out of control or who spank once a
week or more may benefit from professional parenting help. Families
First offers several workshops on limit-setting and alternatives to
spanking. Call them at 617-868-7687.
</P>
<P>
   --Some preventative measures to keep a child's behavior from
escalating so you both lose control: Match expectations to a
child's stage of development and temperament; reinforce positive
behavior whenever you see it; ignore negative behavior as much as
you can, as long as it's not safety- or health-related; learn to
read her cues so she doesn't get to the end of her rope.
</P>
<P>
   --When behaviors are going downhill, put control in your child's
hands: ``Your choice is to stop throwing the food or leave the
table;'' ``You and your brother can decide nicely what show to
watch or turn off the TV.''
</P>

A SCIENCE FICTION _ OR IS IT? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've always been impressed with the way that writers create
worlds out of their imagination, but it wasn't until I read the
science fiction novel ``Dune'' that it occurred to me how much like
gods writers really are. Frank Herbert created an entire planet
that bore only a faint resemblance to any we know. He invented
desert biospheres filled with amazing flora and fauna, then came up
with his own remarkable strategies for coping with an inhospitable
environment.
</P>
<P>
   As I read the ``Dune'' series, I couldn't imagine myself
creating an alternative universe. Yet in the dead of this winter,
laid low by the flu, I've begun dreaming another world into being.
</P>
<P>
   The planet I've been imagining is a gigantic magnet, its two
poles created by a spinning core of molten iron and nickel
thousands of miles beneath its surface. In addition to an
atmosphere, my planet also has magnetic fields, which I call its
``magnetosphere,'' which surge from each pole. At the end closest
to its nearest star, powerful solar winds compress the magnetic
field into a circular shape like a head. At the other end, the
magnetic field streams into a long tail, as if my planet were a
living creature swimming against the currents of space toward its
sun. The magnetosphere protects life on my planet from the star's
infrared, ultraviolet, gamma, and cosmic rays, which would
otherwise prove lethal.
</P>
<P>
   Since the magnetosphere remains stationary while my planet
spins, the planet has constantly changing magnetic fields. The rise
and fall of these magnetic fields affects all the creatures that
live on it, controlling their sleeping and waking, cell division
and hormone production in a ``circadian'' rhythm. In fact, my
planet and all its living creatures vibrate in harmony. As a mother
sleeping beside her child draws the infant into a synchronized
breathing pattern, so my planet ``entrains'' all its children, even
its trees and plants. If existence were a song, my planet and its
living parts would be humming together, and this silent rhythm
would be their lifeline. When I say my creatures are on the same
wavelength as my planet, I speak of a matter of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   My planet also has a magnetic grid overlaying it. If the grid
were visible, my planet would appear to be segmented like an orange
and crossed with intersecting lines. The organisms on my planet
tune in to these magnetic pathways and rely on them for survival.
They're able to do so because they have within their bodies a
substance I call ``magnetite,'' a mineral that reacts to the pull
of magnetism.
</P>
<P>
   My humanoid characters possess magnetite crystals, especially
around the membrane that covers and protects the brain. Long rows
of these crystals also line the bodies of swimming creatures and
surround the eyes of those that fly. As a result, the airborne
creatures, from birds to butterflies, use the planet's magnetic
grid to guide them along migration paths thousands of miles long
while the sea creatures on my planet follow invisible
electromagnetic contours that outline underwater mountains and
valleys. They actually have an additional sense _ an
electromagnetic sense _ that operates like a built-in homing
device. This is a planet perfectly responsive to the life it
creates, nurtures, and protects.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now that I've invented such a remarkable place, I
need a plot. Scientists on my planet have begun using wavelengths
of the electromagnetic spectrum for commercial purposes, creating
intensities a billion times more powerful than those existing
naturally. Some of those wavelengths correspond almost perfectly to
the resonance capacity of living cell membranes, to what effect no
one knows. My humanoids are electromagnetic organisms who absorb
these new electromagnetic pulsations in their bodies as well. For
the first time in their evolutionary history _ day in, day out,
everywhere they go _ they are subjected to newly created
electromagnetic fields of various frequencies and intensities.
</P>
<P>
   Can these frequencies affect brain-wave patterns, damage immune
systems, create physiological stress, adversely affect cell growth,
or cause disease? There are many reasons to think so, but no one
knows for sure. As their inventions for communication become more
ubiquitous, those who profit from them are less and less willing to
tolerate research into what impact this is having on my planet and
its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   When the facts are finally in, will it be too late? This would
make a gripping story, don't you think?
</P>
<P>
   I just can't decide what to call my planet. I asked B. Blake
Levitt, from whose book, ``Electromagnetic Fields,'' I learned all
these things.
</P>
<P>
   She says its name is Earth.

   As the days get longer, we know spring's a-coming. So do the
plants, for light is one of the things that triggers growth in
northern areas. For our outdoor plants, temperature is the other
trigger that determines exactly which day they sprout.
</P>
<P>
   On the equator, because the days are always 12 hours long,
moisture is usually the trigger. As long as light, temperature, and
moisture remain constant, plants grow all year long.
</P>
<P>
   When we grow plants indoors we can control water and
temperature, but the intensity of light and the length of days
change with the seasons, which is one reason why our plants often
grow poorly in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   By understanding light, one can use it to encourage plant
growth, especially when starting seedlings.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to grow perfectly good plants anywhere, even in a
cellar or an interior office with no natural light; it's just a
matter of understanding how plants respond to light levels and
lengths of the day. Many plants will do well under low light
intensity, which is measured in footcandles.
</P>
<P>
   Sunlight may measure 10,000 footcandles in winter, and twice as
many in summer. Yet experiments have had good growth with only 500
footcandles. Measurement can be made with inexpensive light meters.
Intensity diminishes quickly with distance, so the closer to the
light source, the better.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you've noticed that sometimes you buy a lovely big
plant, take it home, and all the leaves fall off. This is common,
especially with plants from supermarkets or chain stores. Most of
these plants have been shipped from some sunny southern clime, with
thick, sturdy leaves that grew in bright sunlight. But in your
house, even in a sunny window, light levels may be too low to keep
those sun-grown leaves happy.
</P>
<P>
   New leaves will often appear, particularly if weak fertilizer is
given regularly to help. The new leaves, because of the dimmer
light, will be thinner and smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Local nurseries usually acclimatize their plants until they get
used to our low winter light levels. They're well worth the extra
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Growth of indoor plants, especially leafy plants, herbs, and
seeds, can be helped by supplemental light. Flowering plants are
much harder to keep blooming without bright outdoor light or a
sunny windowsill.
</P>
<P>
   I have some basil plants under a 15-watt fluorescent light on my
kitchen counter that have been growing all winter. I keep
experimenting with other indoor plants, some in lighted windows,
others in natural light with sun for a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I had some definitive results to report, but the only
thing that seems true is that once a plant is acclimated to its
spot, it grows. Fertilizer seems to make more of a difference in
the rate of growth than light. Fertilizer also seems to help the
flowering things, even with lower light.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of scientific experiments have been done to trick plants
into making them think it was summer by supplying long hours of
supplemental light. It worked best for herbaceous plants. However,
one interesting experiment showed that azalea cuttings grew five
times faster under low light in a windowless room (500 footcandles
for 16 hours) than at twice the light (1,000 footcandles), and also
faster than in a regular greenhouse with the same supplemental
lighting.
</P>
<P>
   This would seem to indicate that you can grow lots of things
almost anywhere using lights.
</P>
<P>
   But what kinds of lights?
</P>
<P>
   Some US Department of Agriculture experiments indicated that
plants would grow best with a full light spectrum, containing
enough blue light wave lengths (plants grow toward blue) and also
enough red light (red makes them grow faster).
</P>
<P>
   A combination of a cool white fluorescent bulb (more blue) plus
a warm yellowish fluorescent bulb (more red) gave the best growth
and longest flowering.
</P>
<P>
   If you are planning to start seeds, find a sunny windowsill, or
plan a shelf with a bulb overhead kept on 16 hours a day. On window
sill or shelf, aluminum foil on the bottom and sides reflects and
increases the light level.
</P>
<P>
   Experiments seem to indicate that the electric lights kept on 16
hours a day make things grow better indoors because plants think
it's summer. But if the plants get bright winter sunlight, the
supplemental light might not help as much, because, by sensing the
short day length, the plants may figure out it's really still
winter.
</P>
<P>
   It always hard to fool Mother Nature.

 &HT;    ARRESTS POINT TO CORRUPTION THREAT ON BORDER
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As drug smuggling from Mexico has surged, U.S.
officials have worried that cash from the cocaine cartels would
tempt American gatekeepers along the 2,000-mile Southwestern
border.
</P>
<P>
   Those suspicions appeared to be confirmed this week as the FBI
announced the arrest of four Immigration and Naturalization Service
(INS) border inspectors on bribery and related charges that
officials say allowed two tons of illegal drugs cross the border at
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Among those arrested, Rafael Landa had the job of checking cars
and trucks for contraband as they tried to enter the United States
through Nogales, Ariz. Instead, Landa waved through vehicles loaded
with cocaine in exchange for an accumulated $300,000 in bribes,
according to an indictment handed down late last month by a grand
jury. Two of his colleagues were charged for similar offenses.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth inspector, Maria De Los Angeles Alabado, a 21-year
veteran of the immigration service, was arrested and charged with
accepting $500 for permits to allow Mexican citizens to travel to
around the United States for up to six months.
</P>
<P>
   Also indicted for paying bribes and drug trafficking were five
members of two reputed Mexican drug smuggling organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials believe that smugglers paid $800,000
altogether in bribes, said Ed Hall, spokesman for the Phoenix
office of the FBI, which leads the Southern Arizona Corruption Task
Force.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hall and others declined to speculate on whether the
handful of arrests is an indicator of much deeper problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been plenty of intelligence of corruption along the
border, and that's why the task force was set up,'' Hall said.
``It's still a priority on the whole Southwest border, and we're
going to continue looking into it.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who chairs the House
immigration subcommittee, said, ``It's a problem that the
congressman is aware of. He continues to monitor it very closely.''
</P>
<P>
   The temptation of drug dollars has been a growing concern of
U.S. officials in the Southwest since the U.S. Coast Guard's
heightened vigilance along the Florida border began causing
smugglers to reroute their trafficking through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   As much as 70 percent of the illegal drug traffic to the United
States now comes through Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Border Patrol has strengthened its numbers
and added new high-tech equipment in the Southwest, making it more
difficult for illegal traffickers to cross the open lands near the
Mexico-U.S. border. And that has increased the pressure on the
official entry points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smugglers try to find the point of least resistance,'' said
Russell Bergeron, an INS spokesman. ``One of the alternatives would
be to attempt to bribe an inspector.''
</P>
<P>
   The overall record for the INS has been good, Bergeron said,
adding that a government review found that only 28 INS border
workers were convicted of corruption between 1992 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, the INS has been rapidly expanding, increasing its
border inspection work force by 43 percent in only three years to
almost 4,700. And although Bergeron said that his agency has not
relaxed its background checks in the hiring drive, others have
expressed doubts about oversight of the newcomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time an agency has this huge growth, it raises concerns
that the people put in positions to mentor these new employees are
prepared to do it,'' said T. J. Bondurant, assistant inspector
general for the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority are honest, but the border inspectors, both
in Customs and INS, are in vulnerable positions,'' he said.

TRAVELING LITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By Simson L. Garfinkle  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Although I do a fair amount of business-related traveling, a
few years ago I realized I was always leaving something important
at home. One time I was at a conference and wanted to get a file
off somebody's laptop, but I didn't have a floppy disk. Another
time I had gone away for a week, planning on getting a lot of
writing done, and discovered that I had left behind my laptop's
power supply.
</P>
<P>
   I dealt with my problem by creating a travel checklist. The list
has important things to bring, and things I should check the day
before I travel. When I remember to use it, my trips generally go
much better.
</P>
<P>
   Norton Mobile Essentials 1.0 from Symantec is supposed to
automate much of the same type of trip planning. Mobile Essentials
has three parts. The first part, ``Before You Go,'' is designed to
help you prepare your laptop and yourself for that business trip.
It tests your modem, runs SCANDISK on your computer's hard drive,
and checks for viruses. Next the program lets you make a backup
copy of your laptop's important files to a floppy or zip drive _
just in case something should go wrong. There's also a database of
important phone numbers, such as hotels, America Online dial-ups,
international phone numbers to report lost credit cards, and even a
traveler's checklist _ one that's remarkably similar to mine.
</P>
<P>
   Mobile Essentials also has a ``Location Controller,'' which is
supposed to reconfigure your laptop's Windows operating system for
different places. Norton will automatically change both your
clock's time and time zone (something that Windows should do, but
doesn't), remap your laptop's drives, configure printers, and so
on. Although this is a good concept, the execution needs more work.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Norton has created the ``Connection Doctor,'' which is
designed to diagnose common dial-up configuration problems.
Unfortunately, the Connection Doctor's main emphasis is hardware
problems: it won't diagnose problems caused by your Internet
service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I was somewhat disappointed with Mobile Essentials,
because it doesn't do what I need. My big problem these days isn't
configuring dial-ups, but file synchronization: I need some files
that are on my desktop, and others that are on the network. I solve
this problem by using the Windows 95 Briefcase. Before I leave, I
copy the directories that I'll need into the ``Briefcase.'' When I
travel I work out of the electronic briefcase. When I get back, I
use the Briefcase's ``update all'' feature to copy the modified
files back to my desktop computer's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   And Mobile Essentials also doesn't really explore a mobile
user's security needs. Virus checking and critical file backup is a
good start, but what laptop users really need is a program that
makes a complete copy of their laptop's hard drive, so if it gets
stolen they can get a replacement and restore all of the data and
applications.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the program should encrypt all the data on the user's
hard drive, so that the stolen data won't be useful to anyone else.
One program that does just that is PGP Disk, by Network Associates.
It costs $39.95, and it's good insurance for any traveling
info-worker.
</P>
<P>
   Although it always helps to carry a floppy with your laptop,
floppy disks are becoming less useful all the time. The reason is
size: although computer hard disks have gone from 200 megabytes to
20 gigabytes over the past five years, the amount of data that you
can put on a 3.5-inch floppy has remained more or less the same.
Fortunately, high-speed network connections have made floppies
largely a thing of the past for desktop users. Now with a little
bit of work, you can make floppies largely irrelevant for laptops
as well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the easiest ways to get data from one laptop to another
is to beam it using infrared radiation. Practically every laptop
manufactured within the last three years has an infrared port;
Windows 98 makes it easy to use this port with ``Infrared
Recipient.''
</P>
<P>
   Infrared Recipient constantly monitors your laptop's infrared
port, sending out the name of the computer you are using and
looking for other notebook systems that are in range. When it sees
another computer, your laptop makes a funny little purring noise
and the name of the other machine appears inside the infrared
monitor window. Once the other computer shows up, you can send it a
file or a whole directory by simply dragging the file to the
infrared recipient folder. The files automatically get beamed
across the link and end up on the other computer in a directory
called ``My Received Files.''
</P>
<P>
   A much faster way to move files between two laptops is to use
Traveling Software's Laplink Professional and the company's new USB
Cable. The purple cable plugs into the USB ports of two laptops and
lets you send data much faster than over an infrared beam. Unlike
the Windows 98 built-in program, you can use Laplink Professional
to send files in both directions and browse the remote computer's
hard drive. Laplink Professional is also a remote access program:
you can use one laptop to control the second laptop over the USB
cable. Controlling a second machine over the USB cable is useful if
you are giving a presentation and there are too many people to fit
around one computer: just use a second laptop as a spare screen!
(Laplink Professional can also use the infrared port in the event
that you accidentally forget the cable at home.) Together, Laplink
Professional and the USB cable cost about $200.

A RADICAL IDEA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lame as Sunday's Super Bowl was, the people who bought tickets
still couldn't have gotten a refund. Too bad the game wasn't
sponsored by Sierra Inc. of Bellevue, Wash. Sierra is a software
company that's busily making amends for its own lousy football
game, and providing an admirable new quality standard for the
entire industry.
</P>
<P>
   In late January, Sierra pulled thousands of copies of its
Football Pro 99 game from store shelves around the nation. No, the
program didn't contain a deadly computer virus. It didn't delete
vital operating system files by mistake, or make smoke come out of
your monitor. Football Pro 99 worked. It just wasn't very good.
</P>
<P>
   To Sierra executives, this was reason enough for a recall. In
addition, Sierra is doling out refunds and free goodies to unhappy
customers, and company president David Grenewetzki publicly
apologized for selling a product before its time. ``We let the
impending end of the football season influence our decision
process,'' said Grenewetzki. ``We figuratively dropped the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   This end-zone grovel is infinitely more attractive than the
preening and strutting we generally see in the computer industry,
so let's give Sierra high marks for doing the right thing. But
let's not forget to ask the obvious question: How does a bad piece
of software come to market in the first place?
</P>
<P>
   I asked Dan Rogers, who oversaw the Football Pro 99 project, and
who describes himself with pulse-quickening candor as ``the guy
that released that really crummy product.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it wasn't supposed to be crummy. The idea was to
create a game that would let hardcore fans simulate entire NFL
seasons, with the computer depicting the probable performances of
actual players and teams. Sort of like Microsoft Flight Simulator
with blitzes.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is that simulation games are murderously difficult to
create, and Sierra wanted this one on store shelves before the end
of the football season. People were putting in 120-hour weeks, said
Rogers. ``I had guys who were sleeping there. I was sleeping there.
I hadn't seen my wife in a month.''
</P>
<P>
   And it still wasn't enough. The only way to make the deadline
was to cut corners. ``You start talking to the quality-assurance
guys and inch by inch your quality seems to slip and you start
making compromises,'' said Rogers. ``You don't even realize you're
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   The game wouldn't work properly with a number of those popular
three-dimensional graphics accelerator cards that gamers love.
Equally important, it just didn't simulate the NFL with sufficient
accuracy. Running backs didn't gain as much yardage as they should
have; quarterbacks didn't pass for the right number of yards. But
hey, it's a game. Who's going to know or care?
</P>
<P>
   The gamers, that's who. ``The user reactions from our fans was
immediately very bad,'' said Rogers. ``We just said, `My gosh, what
did we do?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's more a question of what they didn't do. Software quality
experts say there are fundamental flaws in the way most programs
are designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can deliver much higher quality than they do today. Most
of them just don't understand how to do it,'' says John Pustaver,
president of Creative Data Systems in Sudbury, Mass. and an
experienced software tester. Pustaver said many software firms
neglect rigorous planning and testing, and instead just strive to
get the product out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bampos, vice president of software quality assurance at
Metamor Software Solutions in Newton, Mass., says the Internet has
made the problem worse, by allowing firms to rush bad products to
market and then post repair patches on line.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra, too, is offering a patch for Football Pro 99 users, but
the firm has gone much further. Customers can also get their money
back, plus a credit good for any $30 Sierra game. In addition, the
company created a Web site called Home Team where customers can
consult with Sierra developers about the design of Football Pro
2000, to make sure they get it right. ``We have been overwhelmed
with customer support,'' he said. Then again, Sierra may have
overwhelmed its customers by embracing the radical idea that
software shouldn't be sold until it works.

STUDY CAN'T CONFIRM BLOOD-PRESSURE LINK

 Study can't confirm blood-pressure link
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As they've looked for ways to prevent mental decline in older
people, doctors have thought that controlling high blood pressure
might be a key. A new study of more than 2,000 elderly people in
East Boston, however, failed to find a strong effect of high blood
pressure on mental sharpness over nine years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have this great fear that we are going to lose our
minds as we age,'' said Robert J. Glynn, a biostatistician at
Brigham and Women's Hospital. ``I had hoped that we would find this
(blood pressure) was really important, but the evidence was not
compelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has yielded conflicting findings about the
effects of high blood pressure, which can cause minor or temporary
strokes that some investigators thought could impair brain
function.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer subjects were men and women ages 65 to 102
participating in the East Boston component of two large studies of
hypertension, or high blood pressure. They had blood-pressure
readings taken nine years apart and were given brief cognitive
function tests every three years to check for any mental decline.
Glynn said there was a slight relationship between higher systolic
blood pressure (the higher of the two numbers in a blood pressure
reading) and declines in cognitive function, but that there wasn't
strong enough evidence to support a link.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; New heart monitor can go under the skin
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors often have a hard time finding the cause when someone
faints repeatedly, but a new, thin heart monitor that can be
implanted under the skin can aid enormously in the search for
clues, says a Boston researcher.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Josephson, a cardiologist at Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center in Boston, said the 2-inch-diameter, 3/4-inch thick
monitor ``is like the black box on an airplane used to determine
the cause of a crash.'' Josephson said the monitor ``records
important data that can be saved and replayed later'' to determine
why the person fainted.
</P>
<P>
   The monitor, made by Medtronic Inc. and called Reveal, functions
like a tiny electrocardiograph and stores evidence of abnormal
heart rhythms for later study.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional heart recorders, like the standard Holter monitor,
are more cumbersome, with external electrodes that have to be
connected to the skin. People usually wear the monitor for a day
and may not faint during that time, said Josephson. The new monitor
``can capture the rare events you wouldn't get on a Holter,'' even
if worn for many days, Josephson said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   A study in the journal Circulation last week showed that the
Reveal monitor identified whether the fainting was due to abnormal
heart rhythms in 86 percent of patients, according to a statement
from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Josephson said use of the Reveal monitor may save the cost and
discomfort of electrophysiological studies done in the hospital
that attempt to provoke the arrhythmia. But the cost-effectiveness
of the monitor has yet to be proven, he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Benefits not certain for antioxidant pills
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even though foods containing antioxidant substances like
vitamins A, C, and E seem to lower the risk of heart disease,
there's no scientific basis for recommending that people take
antioxidants in pill form, says the American Heart Association.
</P>
<P>
   Antioxidants mop up excess amounts of free radicals _ substances
produced in the body that are believed to play a role in the
development of atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attacks.
Foods high in vitamins C and E and beta carotene, a form of vitamin
A, have been shown to reduce risks of heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this doesn't necessarily mean that high levels of
antioxidants achieved by consuming vitamin pills will provide
similar benefits or are even safe,'' said Diane Tribble, a
scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in
California and a member of the heart association's nutrition
committee. The association's journal, Circulation, this week
published the scientific advisory on antioxidant supplements.

 TROUBLESHOOTING YOUR HOME PC

<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   Will Jan. 1, 2000, mean disaster for millions of home computer
users? Maybe, if the worst fears of millennium bug mavens are
realized and the nation's electrical power grid collapses.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, it won't be all that big a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Although half of all US households have at least one PC, these
machines are mainly used for noncritical tasks like cruising the
Internet and playing games. These activities probably won't be
disrupted by the Y2K bug, and even if they are, it'll be more of a
nuisance than a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many people use their home machines for serious work, and
even those who don't would just as soon avoid any unpleasantness.
So perhaps you ought to 2000-proof your PC.
</P>
<P>
   There are three points of vulnerability in each computer. Some
key hardware components can be susceptible to the millennium bug.
The operating system _ the software that controls the machine's
most basic functions _ must also be considered. Then there are
applications _ the programs you actually want to run, like games
and word processors.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the hardware. There's a chip called an RTC or
real-time clock, which keeps track of the date and time. Every time
you start the machine, the clock is read by a program called BIOS _
Basic Input-Output System _ which is permanently stored on a chip
and runs during startup. The BIOS passes clock information to your
operating system, so it knows the correct time.
</P>
<P>
   On just about every PC made before 1993, the RTC and the BIOS
can't handle dates beyond the year 2000. Even many machines
produced since then suffer from the bug. When next Jan. 1 rolls
around, these machines will think it's 1900.
</P>
<P>
   One way to test whether your machine is vulnerable is to
manually set the clock to 11:59 p.m., Dec. 31, 1999, then see what
happens one minute later. Or, download a free test utility from
National Software Testing Laboratories at www.nstl.com. If your
computer flunks the test, you should be able to resolve the problem
by resetting the clock by hand.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes the operating systems, products like Microsoft's
MS-DOS and Windows software, or the Apple Macintosh OS. Well, never
mind about the Mac. Once again, its operating system will be
untroubled. As Apple officials like to say, ``At least we knew the
century was going to end.''
</P>
<P>
   This fact eluded programmers at Microsoft for many a year.
MS-DOS and Windows have Y2K problems. Even Windows 98, released
just a few months ago, is tainted with the bug. Microsoft says the
problems aren't likely to cause serious difficulties, but the
company offers a complete listing of known Y2K flaws in its
software at www.microsoft.com/technet/year2k.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there are your application programs to worry about, and
owning a Mac won't protect you. For instance, older versions of the
financial planning program Quicken are Y2K-deficient on PCs and
Macs alike. Intuit Inc., the maker of Quicken, says it'll have free
repair patches before the year is out at www.intuit.com.
</P>
<P>
   You'll need to check the Y2K compliance of all your
applications. Make an inventory of your software and contact the
manufacturer to learn if you've got a problem.

STANSKY MOVES MAGELLAN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Stansky will mark his third anniversary at the helm of
Fidelity's giant Magellan fund next month, and shareholders should
celebrate with him.
</P>
<P>
   Stansky has managed to bring the rare combination of stability
and performance to what is arguably the toughest job in the mutual
fund world, qualities Magellan sorely needed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``People gave Magellan and Bob a lot of heat,'' said Eric
Kobren, publisher of Fidelity Insight, an independent newsletter.
``I think he's done a fantastic job.''
</P>
<P>
   Stansky, 43, was under the gun during his first months on the
Magellan job because he seemed to be taking his sweet time
unloading the large and disastrous bond portfolio inherited from
predecessor Jeffrey Vinik. Billions of dollars fled the fund.
</P>
<P>
   No one is giving him heat now.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan turned heads in 1998 when it handily beat the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 stock index _ rising 33.6 percent vs. 28.6 percent for
the index. Skeptics had doubted the lumbering growth fund, with $84
billion in assets, could ever accomplish such a performance again.
</P>
<P>
   But Magellan has outrun the S&AMP;P 500 for an even longer stretch
during the Stansky era. Over the two-year period between the end of
January 1997 and the same point this year, the fund earned 70.5
percent, just a shade better than the S&AMP;P's 68.1 percent. It's a
narrow margin, to be sure, but four out of every five growth funds
failed to beat the index over the same period of time.
</P>
<P>
   The Magellan strategy: slow, seemingly glacial portfolio shifts
that earned market index-like returns, plus a few bold moves when a
rare opportunity presented itself.
</P>
<P>
   Such an opportunity came during plunging markets for technology
stocks in the summer and fall of last year. That made many stocks
Stansky favored much cheaper to buy, and it also freed him from the
problem of the fund's sheer size. For any one stock to have a real
impact on Magellan's performance, the fund has to buy shares worth
hundreds of millions of dollars. Purchases of that magnitude, even
spread out over time, almost always push the price way up and make
the investment more expensive to accumulate. The normal equation of
supply versus demand is temporarily thrown out of whack.
</P>
<P>
   But the tech stock plunge suddenly produced an abundance of
sellers. Magellan could buy in bulk and not price itself out of the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Stansky bought more Microsoft Corp., already the fund's
second-largest holding. He bought more Cisco Systems Inc. and Intel
Corp. He loaded up on America Online Inc., which became Magellan's
third-largest holding by the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, he took advantage of the tech dip,'' said James
Lowell, publisher of Fidelity Investor, another independent
newsletter. ``That's sort of a return to the old afterburners that
used to drive the fund.''
</P>
<P>
   Those tech shares certainly were the real catalyst behind a
booming fourth quarter at Magellan. As technology stocks began to
stage a furious rally in early October, the fund rose with them.
Magellan soared 27.2 percent in the last three months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Fund analysts note Magellan's 1998 return beat the S&AMP;P 500 but
actually trailed the 35.7 percent average return of growth funds
investing exclusively in big stocks. But Magellan's portfolio did
not fit into that best-performing category at the start of the
year. Stansky's holdings were a blend of growth stocks (companies
with quickly rising earnings) and value stocks (companies whose
share price has fallen to bargain prices). He had maneuvered
Magellan into the best group of stocks by taking advantage of the
opportunity in technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's developed a very good strategy for running an $80 billion
fund,'' said Russ Kinnel, equity funds editor at Morningstar Inc.,
a Chicago fund-tracking firm. ``That's probably more encouraging
than any of the return data.''
</P>
<P>
   Stansky has made other changes at Magellan, beginning with
number of stocks it owns. His roster has been trimmed from about
500 to 334, eliminating small positions that rarely have an impact
on performance.
</P>
<P>
   Even Stansky's fans caution that Magellan is too big to ever
truly clobber the market as it did many years ago. Kobren and
Lowell both praise Stansky but rate Magellan as only a ``hold.''
Think of it as perhaps a core growth investment in a broader,
long-term portfolio, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Another gloomier measure of the Stansky era: Magellan customers
have cashed in $10.1 billion more shares than they have bought
since the fund changed managers, according to Financial Research
Corp. Most of the declines took place in Stansky's first year and
the fund has been closed to most new investors since 1997.

STARR SOURCES; VIET NEWS; JUDGING STORIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Before the presidential impeachment scandal grinds to a halt,
could The New York Times find itself following Monica Lewinsky,
Vernon Jordan, and Sidney Blumenthal to the witness stand?
</P>
<P>
   Several First Amendment experts worry that the Times _ and other
media outlets _ might be compelled to finger their confidential
sources as part of an investigation into alleged leaks coming from
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr's office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been worrying about this ever since the first
investigation started,'' says Jane Kirtley, executive director of
the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. ``I think there
is such a scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's almost inevitable'' that reporters will be asked
to reveal sources ``as this investigation goes along,'' says Paul
McMasters, the Freedom Forum's First Amendment ombudsman. As the
trial ends, ``more and more attention by the media and the courts
will be paid to what exactly the relationship between the
prosecutor and the media was.''
</P>
<P>
   This speculation comes after news that presidential attorney
David Kendall will seek sanctions against Starr for allegedly
leaking a story to the Times Sunday that Starr was considering
whether to indict President Clinton. Starr has said he plans to
conduct his own investigation of the Times matter. And there is
already a court-ordered probe of possible leaks from Starr's
office, although there are no reports to date of journalists being
quizzed about their sources. (Last year, Globe columnist John Ellis
revealed publicly that he had received information from Starr's
office. Globe vice president and assistant to the publisher Alfred
S. Larkin Jr. said Wednesday that Ellis was contacted by an
investigator, but refused to cooperate voluntarily. No subpoena has
been issued.)
</P>
<P>
   Kirtley says any investigation of leaks could hinge on whether
it is guided by the Washington, D.C., shield law _ which offers
absolute protection for confidential sources _ or the more
ambiguous ``federal privilege'' for protecting the identity of
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect every journalist to invoke reporter's
privilege,'' says McMasters. But he warns that many reporters could
end up ``facing the difficult choice of court sanctions or giving
up their sources.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article Tuesday on Kendall's latest complaint about Starr
leaks, Times Washington editor Adam Clymer told his own paper, ``We
do not discuss our sources.'' If Times staffers were compelled to
reveal their sources, company spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen says, ``We
would take appropriate legal advice.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   With 107,000 Vietnamese residents in its home base of Santa
Clara County, Calif., the San Jose Mercury News decided it was
staring at a community in need of its own newspaper. So last week,
the 291,000-circulation daily rolled out the first 20,000 copies of
Viet Mercury, a free Vietnamese-language weekly paper.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mercury News executive editor Jerry Ceppos, there
already were at least three indigenous Vietnamese dailies and a
number of weeklies in the area. But he characterizes all of them as
``partisan in one way or another.''
</P>
<P>
   The Viet Mercury, produced by a separate six-person Vietnamese
staff, will include stories prepared for that paper and some
stories translated from the Mercury News. At the same time, some
Viet Mercury articles will be translated into English for the
Mercury News.
</P>
<P>
   Ceppos says that after a start-up period, ``the goal is
absolutely to have it support itself.'' So far, the signs are good.
After planning for a 32-page issue, the debut Viet Mercury ran 88
pages. ``And I'm told you can't find last week's issue anywhere in
town anymore,'' says Ceppos.
</P>
<P>

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A discarded idea for media accountability is picking up steam
again, thanks to help from an unlikely source. The news council _
an independent body that adjudicates citizen complaints against
media outlets _ has been pretty much of a dead letter since a
national news council collapsed in the early 1980s. The one success
story has been the 28-year-old Minnesota News Council.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a new Washington (State) News Council and the
stirring of a similar effort in Oregon. And they have one of
journalism's pit bulls to thank. ``Probably the impetus was the `60
Minutes' piece that Mike Wallace did,'' says John Hamer, the former
Seattle Times editorial board member who is the council's executive
director.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Wallace began advocating for news councils to
increase media accountability. In late 1996, he and a ``60
Minutes'' crew sat in when the Minnesota News Council ruled that a
local TV station's report on Northwest Airlines' safety record was
journalistically flawed. The impact of that ``60 Minutes'' piece
was startling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had inquiries immediately from people in 29 states,'' says
Minnesota council executive director Gary Gilson.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, Hamer characterizes the local journalistic community's
response to the Washington News Council as mixed. ``The management
of both major dailies (The Seattle Times and The Seattle
Post-Intelligencer) have been saying we'll stay neutral right
now.'' But tellingly, the Times is allowing a staffer to serve as a
media member of the council.

OLD VINYL FLOORING MAY CONTAIN ASBESTOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I plan to put ceramic tiles on my bathroom floor. The house
is nearly 70 years old. There is vinyl flooring there now, and I
was told that under that vinyl is asbestos. What can I do now
before putting in the ceramic tile?
</P>
<P>
   BILL GENTLE, Arlington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You won't know what is under the vinyl until you test both
the vinyl that's on the floor now and anything underneath. Sheet
vinyl, installed as recently as 15 to 20 years ago, may have a
white or gray backing; if so, it is probably asbestos. Break off a
small piece and have it tested by an asbestos abatement company (in
the Yellow Pages). If there is no asbestos, you can go ahead and
scrape up everything to the wood floor. Then put down a sheet of
concrete board (WonderBoard is one brand), and apply the tiles with
a thin-set mortar. You could do the same over the existing sheet
vinyl.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My house has hot-water heat with four zones. The radiators
are baseboards. One room is not very warm but other rooms beyond it
and further down the system are warm enough. There are not many
radiators in the baseboards of the room in question but there are a
lot of bare pipes (without fins) under a baseboard cover. Can I try
clamping fins on some of those bare pipes?
</P>
<P>
   PAUL SCHOTTLER, Acton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think the fins will help a lot because they will radiate
more heat into the room than the bare copper pipe will. The
installers might just have missed putting in the fins or using
finned pipes; I can't imagine how this could happen, but it is
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers of the fins are Samuel Hurwitz Co., Plumbing Supply, 120
Southampton St., Roxbury, MA, 617-442-3500; and Patented
Manufacturing Co., Dept. PP, Lincoln, MA 01773.

   The saga of varnished hardwood floors continues: S.C. of Revere
told us this: ``I got tired of the rugs on several
beautifully-varnished hardwood floors, so I took them up. I was
also concerned how long the varnish would last if it was not
protected, especially since I have two dogs. A contractor did the
varnishing, and on the floors with an oil-based polyurethane, I
have no scratches or any other damage. There are lots of scratches
on the water-based polyurethane.''
</P>
<P>
   S.C.'s commentary illustrates the superiority of oil-based
polyurethane over water-based polyurethane, although the
contractor-installed, oil-based polyurethane might have been
moisture-cured polyurethane, superior to both the other varnishes.
The moisture-cured varnish cannot be installed by the layman; it
must be professionally applied. According to many floor men,
moisture-cured is the best.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My old-fashioned steel milk can is still in good shape; that
is, it is not falling apart and has no holes. But there is some
rust; in fact the whole outside of the can has a patina of rust, an
orange color. How can I clean it up? Is there a shop that does this
sort of thing?
</P>
<P>
   SHEILA WHALEN, Holliston, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The only shops that I know of that treat metal are those that
do replating, and since your can is galvanized, there is nothing to
replate. So here is what you can do: Dip fine steel wool in paint
thinner and rub off the rust. Once it is clean of rust, you can
give it a very fine coat of oil, which will help prevent further
rust. So will keepng it in a dry, warm place, such as a house. To
apply that thin coat of oil, sprinkle a few drops of mineral or
lubricating oil on a cloth, knead the cloth to spread the oil
around, and wipe down the can. Dispose of oily cloths safely by
burning them.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I think I have a bat in my bathroom. I saw it on a towel
rack, then scooting on the floor. I closed the door and am not
happy about going back in. How can I get rid of it?
</P>
<P>
   AFRAID OF BATS
</P>
<P>
   A. The bat probably got into the bathoom from the attic or other
nook in which it was hibernating. If it doesn't go back to its
roost, it may die because of its hibernation being disturbed. If
you dare go back into the bathroom, open the window wide and turn
on all the lights in that room. The bat is likely to leave. If that
doesn't appeal to you, call an animal control person, who is listed
in the Yellow pages under ``Exterminators.''

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of dogs and ski trails and, well, a bunch of stuff like that:
</P>
<P>
   I realized last Sunday at Wompatuck State Park that my dimming
enthusiasm about cross-country skiing had nothing to do with
cross-country skiing, but with the general impotence of the most
recent New England winters.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the mountain country so much, because Alpine ski areas,
especially those with half-mile or more altitude, produce plenty of
machine-made snow to help nature over her dry spells.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's the backyard I'm talking about. The woods and golf
course, the summer meadows turned to winter whalebacks, all those
places that, when covered with snow, become snow playgrounds. The
world refreshed and bright and amazingly fun.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind, a perfect winter Sunday this side of the Alpine
slopes combines cross-country skiing, Bloody Marys and Mozart, not
necessarily in equal amounts.
</P>
<P>
   And, just as I remember winters in my childhood when it seems we
played pond hockey every afternoon into the dark, it now seems that
we had winters with lots more casual cross-country skiing than we
have now.
</P>
<P>
   The local ski shop in my town _ a coastal town subject to salty
ocean air, a known snow-wrecker _ once kept a few dozen pair of
skinny skis to rent out to locals who skied on the golf course and
in the town forest on weekend afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime a decade or so ago, the shop dropped its ski rental
business, not for any lack of interest, but because those Currier
and Ives winters seem to have gone the way of buggywhips.
</P>
<P>
   Or is it just the way memory works? Doesn't every kid remember
the few big snowfalls of childhood and believe that it was like
that every day of every winter? One big blizzard with the power out
for three days, living in candlelight and frigid air, goes a long
way in the memory.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, when one of those matchless days of snow comes along
these winters, we take note. And click on the skis. Wompatuck State
Park in Hingham, Mass. was our spot, a nice woodsy corner of
Boston's South Shore with trails and meadows all rather mellow,
i.e. no hills worthy of mention.
</P>
<P>
   It was easy to forget this matchless Sunday of primary colors _
gold and blue and bright, fresh snow _ that Wompatuck Park is a
former ammunition depot from the World War II era (Lord knows
what's buried down under all that gorgeous snow) or that last time
the Grateful Dead came to town that woebegone band of aging,
time-warped hippies that orbited the band everywhere, ended up
camping in Wompatuck where they threw a blast that scared
suburbanites out of their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, we skied the park, not that there were tons of snow last
Sunday. The skis did tend to hang up on a few exposed rocks along
the woods paths. Still, judging by the crowds that were out skiing
after the one storm in weeks that blanketed the region, there is a
latent hunger in folks everywhere to get out and play in snow.
</P>
<P>
   And the day did raise more questions than answers about our
snowy pursuits. It seems there was a dog in our foursome, a
spirited golden retriever that would run ahead on the trail then,
dismayed about the slowness of its human companions, kept doubling
back as if to tell us to get the lead out.
</P>
<P>
   Along the trail we encountered two ladies skiing in the opposite
direction, and as we stopped to let each other pass, one of them
remonstrated us for skiing with a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want dogs on the ski tracks,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now understand, the couple who own (are owned by) said dog,
found it a year or so back by following a star in the East that
brought them to the puppy manger to find their furry miracle.
</P>
<P>
   So the dog's owner, an experienced skier who understands well
that dogs are not allowed at real cross-country centers with tracks
set for skis, opined as how this was a state park supported by tax
dollars, and the tracks were only there by the chance passing of
other skiers. They had not been set for skiing at all, and family
pooches had as much right on the paths as the people they brought
there.
</P>
<P>
   This issue was left unresolved, but it did become a focal
controversy in the cross-country world almost as hotly contended as
one which occurred a few weeks before when, as a highly opinionated
person I happen to know was skiing on a golf course, she was
verbally accosted by a man she referred to only as ``a fuming
idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he say to you?'' she was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``To stay off the greens, whatever they are. I thought golf
courses were all green.''
</P>
<P>
   The man told her that skiing on the greens ruins them for
golfers, though she doubted there were any golfers around, and had
not seen one out all day.
</P>
<P>
   No, the man said, the skis make impressions on the greens that
stay when spring comes.
</P>
<P>
   To which the skier, somewhat chagrined at the suggestion that
her weight could make such impressions, ended the conversation by
suggesting that golfers need more of a challenge anyway, and that
they should play in fields of real grass, as the Scottish used to
do.
</P>
<P>
   So here are the questions left for readers to help us with: (1)
Should dogs be allowed to gambol in the snow at non-cross-country
ski areas? (2) Do skiers really imprint golf courses with their
tracks, or is this just more golf folderal?

MELANIE GRIFFITH: BAD GIRL MAKES GOOD 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Melanie Griffith has played some dangerous and wild characters
on screen, but perhaps none more so than Sid in ``Another Day in
Paradise,'' opening Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a wild movie, a tough movie,'' Griffith agrees. ``I'd
never been asked to make a movie like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sid is the girlfriend of Mel (James Woods), a thief and drug
dealer who can be charming _ until he gets drunk. Mel goes on a
road-trip crime spree, taking with him Sid and a pair of drugged up
teen-age lovers.
</P>
<P>
   How tough is Sid?
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the movie, Mel's gang is in a tight spot with
some rival drug dealers. Sid gets them out of the jam with an
aggressively applied shotgun. And she looks comfortable doing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father taught me how to shoot, starting when I was 4, so I
am pretty handy with a shotgun,'' Griffith says. Her voice is
girlish, and she freely sprinkles giggles and four-letter words in
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Tough though she is, Sid is also the most humane character in
the film, taking a maternal interest in the young lovers, Bobbie
and Rosie, played by Natasha Gregson Wagner (daughter of Natalie
Wood) and Vincent Kartheiser. Sid tries to keep them out of trouble
with Mel and the law.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith, 41, says it was the chance to play a character like
Sid that led her to do the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never played a heroin addict or a thief or a junkie. Once
in ''Fear City,`` a movie I did a long time ago (1984), I was kind
of a semi-junkie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a phone call from Jimmy Woods saying you've got to read
this script. I'm going to produce it. I'm going to star in it. I'll
split my salary with you, which was nothing anyway.'' She laughs.
``It was a very low-budget film. I didn't do it for the money,
that's for sure. I just thought, `Wow, this is really cool and
different and interesting.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While it's true that Griffith's most successful role was as a
secretary turned smart businesswoman in ``Working Girl'' (with
Harrison Ford), Sid is not a total departure from past roles.
Directors have tended to cast her as wild, bad or sexy.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith's first part, an extra, was at age 14 in ``The Harrad
Experiment'' (1973), which starred her mother, Tippi Hedren (``The
Birds,'' ``Marnie''), and Griffith's future two-time husband, Don
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But her first attention-grabbing role came in 1975, playing a
wild, promiscuous teen-ager opposite Gene Hackman in ``Night
Moves.'' And early in her career, she appeared in nude photos in
Playboy with Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   After that beginning, she was often typecast as a bad or sexy
woman, including her most notable characters before her
Oscar-nominated ``Working Girl'' role: Brian De Palma's ``Body
Double'' (porn star); Jonathan Demme's ``Something Wild'' (bad
girl): and Mike Figgis' ``Stormy Monday'' (prostitute).
</P>
<P>
   In her private life, Griffith also went through a long period of
drug addiction and a well-publicized rehab program. Her up-and-down
romantic life, especially her two marriages to Johnson and her
latest one to Antonio Banderas, also have received much attention.
</P>
<P>
   So it's surprising that Griffith seems confused at the
suggestion that she has a wild and sexy reputation. She seems more
comfortable when the description is changed to ``free-spirited''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe I am partly that way,'' she says, sounding
thoughtful.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, ``Working Girl'' opened a broader range of roles
to her, and her nearly 3-year-old marriage to actor Banderas (``The
Mask of Zorro'') has made her personal life more stable.
</P>
<P>
   She has said that Johnson was not supportive, but today, at the
hint of a question about that, she interrupts quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to say that.'' She laughs as though sharing a
little joke. ``I know where you're going.''
</P>
<P>
   She has no hesitation, however, saying that Banderas is
encouraging of her and her career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, completely. He's right here with me. We just saw the
movie (''Crazy in Alabama``) we did together last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Banderas, who is sitting nearby listening, reminds her the
response cards to the sneak preview were good, and she giggles
again. ``Crazy in Alabama'' is a comedy-drama directed by Banderas.
Griffith stars as an eccentric who leaves her husband in the South
to try her luck in Hollywood. The film is due out in late spring or
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so cool. It's so great, I mean ...,'' she's momentarily
at a loss for words about Banderas' movie. ``He's really good. I
know I'm his wife, but he's really good.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Day in Paradise'' is the second directorial effort for
55-year-old photographer Larry Clark. Clark shook up the movie
world in 1995 with his controversial debut film, ``Kids,'' a
graphic portrayal of pre-teen street life, depicting youths
drinking, drugging and having mean-spirited sex. It outraged many
viewers and led to accusations that Clark was too emotionally
involved with his child actors. But there was no denying his
ability to tell a powerful story.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith was impressed with Clark's work on ``Another Day in
Paradise,'' despite the major discord that flared on the set and
afterward. There were times when Clark and Woods and Clark and
co-producer/co-writer Stephen Chin almost came to blows.
</P>
<P>
   Chin and Woods had mortgaged their homes to finance the movie.
Clark, who has had a long history of drug problems, put their
security in jeopardy when he got back on heroin and wouldn't _ or
couldn't _ complete editing the movie in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry is a great guy, he really is,'' Griffith says. ``He
tries really hard, and he made a great movie. I don't want to be
too hard on him because he just got out of rehab. He had a relapse
after he finished the movie, and now he's great again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing I like about this movie is it's anti-drug,''
insists Griffith, who says she has been drug-free for 10 years.
``There is nothing supportive of doing drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   After her good reviews for ``Something Wild'' and the success of
``Working Girl,'' Griffith seemed on her way to major stardom. But
a series of career choices that seemed good on paper _ ``Bonfire of
the Vanities,'' ``Shining Through,'' ``Born Yesterday,'' ``A
Stranger Among Us,'' ``Milk Money'' _ turned out to be
disappointments or disasters. Griffith's acting reputation took a
beating.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's OK; I don't care.'' she says. ``I'm not bothered by
it, you know what I mean? I feel like I still have a life.''
Another giggle. ``I still have some time.
</P>
<P>
   She prefers to be optimistic that her career is again on the
upswing with her well-received small roles in ``Lolita,'' Woody
Allen's ``Celebrity'' and now a lead in ``Another Day in
Paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty happy with what I've done,'' Griffith says. ``I
mean, my family comes first. Antonio and my kids are much more
important than trying to calculate a career. I just take what
comes.''
</P>

FINALLY, HE MAKES THE GRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, N.H. _ The day started bad early for Gren Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   He was overdressed. He was sweating. He was scared. He was lost,
his family nowhere to be found. He felt like an unhappy 8-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   But then, he found himself looking into a pair of beautiful and
kindly eyes, a miracle on snow. And the woman said to him: ``Come
with me. I can help you.''
</P>
<P>
   And he did, and she did. And Grenville has lived happily ever
after. So far.
</P>
<P>
   No, Gren Anderson was no little boy on that momentous afternoon
last winter when he made his first turns on a pair of skis. It just
felt that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 45,'' says Anderson, an investment adviser for Fiduciary
Trust in Boston. ``And I hated winter. It was just a terrible time
for me. Every time it snowed I was bummed.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Anderson had skied once before, which is why he was so
scared at the prospect of doing it again. As a teenager ``I nearly
killed myself'' when he went on a group trip to Woodstock, and so
he had pretty much written skiing out of his life.
</P>
<P>
   But Anderson didn't want to waste an entire season simply
because he hated every winter weekend. And he thought of his wife,
Melanie, who had skied before but wasn't getting the opportunity
now. And perhaps most important, he thought of his 9-year-old
daughter, Ali, whose friends went north to ski on winter weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that Ali should really get the chance to know how to
ski,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So Anderson, a man who likes to take life in large bites, made
the grand gesture. He booked a week's lodging at Sunday River last
February vacation, made arrangements for equipment rental, then
went to the Bob Smith ski shop and said, when asked what he needed:
``Picture me in my underwear. Start there.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, his extended family _ sister Kim,
brother-in-law Richard Andrew and kids _ were so delighted with the
coming spectacle of Gren on skis that they rented a condo near the
Andersons for the same week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all so excited,'' he remembers, ``and I was getting
nervous. I knew I did not need an audience. I could picture the
humiliation.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, it is more difficult for someone in middle age to
take up a sport that so many have imprinted in their muscles and
nervous systems as children. As the vacation week approached, Gren
remembers asking himself several times, ``Why did I do this?''
</P>
<P>
   So the inevitable morning arrived, and the first thing Anderson
discovered was that the people at Bob Smith had taken him at his
word and had a field day. He put on all his new ski clothes _ long
underwear, overalls, turtle neck, fleece sweatshirt, new ski
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hardly walk with everything on,'' he remembers,
sensing early trouble, ``I fell off the bed and couldn't get up.
They had to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, out into the crowd of a February vacation, he remembers
putting on a little slapstick show (you know the one where you bend
over to pick up the ski pole you dropped and whack someone behind
you with the skis on your shoulder). And he could not quite get out
of his mind a thought that if simple locomotion without skis was
this tough, what would skis feel like?
</P>
<P>
   The first wise idea he had was to sign up for a group lesson,
but he had to wait 50 minutes ``for my public execution.''
Meanwhile his daughter and her cousins all came up to him to give
him a grim ``Good luck!'' before they took off skiing, and his wife
and the in-laws took off, leaving Gren miserable, abandoned, and
sweating. Then things really got scary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out front and looked up at that mountain and almost
fainted,'' he said. The kids' ``Good luck'' rang in his ears. But
then, something like a devine intercession occurred. Behind him, he
heard a voice at the ski school say, ``Betty, my lesson's been
canceled.'' It was an instructor who was signed up to give an hour
private lesson, and Gren Anderson jumped at the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like the heavens parted,'' he remembers. ``I was
looking at this beautiful pair of eyes, and I don't think I'd ever
met anyone as nice. I said to her, `I'm out of shape. I've never
skied. My family left me here. And I'm scared.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The instructor, named Maggie, he thinks, ignored his whining and
(after peeling off a layer or two of clothing so that he could
move) simply said: ``Let's go skiing.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the epiphany of Grenville Anderson. From that day, a new
skier was born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took three days of lessons,'' he says, ``and I'll always be
grateful to Maggie because she was so kind and helpful. At one
point she said, `My job is to make you want to ski. Don't worry.'
''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest fear at first is common to most new skiers: how to
stay in control. From the top of the beginner's hill, Anderson
learned how to ski in a snowplow (wedge), and the first time he
turned left and right all the way from top to bottom, he recalls,
``I was hooked. I knew I had overcome a personal fear. I knew I was
going to ski.''
</P>
<P>
   From there it was to the top and his first run all the way down.
Then to Waterville Valley, more lessons, and this year to Loon over
Christmas vacation, where he graduated to blue runs, still taking
lessons. At one point, after being hit by an out-of-control
snowboarder, Anderson's instructor skied above him, removing his
fear about a similar incident as he was concentrating on his form.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just knew what to do,'' he says. ``He knew I was nervous
about being hit again and took away the fear.'' Just more
supporting evidence, according to Anderson, that lessons are the
way to learn skiing, especially for a scared middle-ager.
</P>
<P>
   And the rewards?
</P>
<P>
   ``Skiing has really changed my life,'' he says. ``The greatest
thing is that I love winter now, and I love being outdoors and
having a new family experience.''
</P>
<P>
   The real reward, he says, came over the Christmas holidays when
he found himself riding up the lift with Ali, now 10. As most kids
know, some of the best skiing snow is found when it rains, but most
people over about age 15 want no part of wearing plastic bags over
their parkas and putting up with all that wet.
</P>
<P>
   But with skiing, Gren Anderson is a fully reborn adolescent, and
as he rode into the soggy heavens, still amazed at where he was and
what he was doing, he heard his daughter say, ``Daddy, it's so
great you're skiing. It's so great to be skiing with you.''

CELTICS TALK TURKEY TO GARNETT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Last February, Marlon Garnett was playing professional
basketball in Turkey, enduring less than adequate sanitary
facilities in some locker rooms, communicating with the coaching
staff through an interpreter, playing on courts that were also used
for soccer, and, he smiled, ``eating lots of shish kebob, rice, and
beef.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's a backup point guard with the Celtics, thanks to being
in the right place at the right time after returning from overseas
_ specifically, playing on the same court with Boston's No. 1 draft
pick, Paul Pierce, in Los Angeles when Celtics coach Rick Pitino
dropped by to take a peek at Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is this year's Bruce Bowen,'' said Pitino Wednesday in
reference to the player who was also signed as a free agent and
went on to become a defensive force last season. ``We went out to
look at Pierce in the summertime, and I asked someone who that
point guard was. I watched him play, loved what I saw, and brought
him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marlon's a great find for us because he shoots it so well,''
added Pitino, who signed Garnett to a free agent contract two weeks
ago, ``and he's a tough, hard-nosed ballplayer like Bruce.''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, who can play both point and shooting guard, was the
West Coast Conference Player of the Year at Santa Clara in 1997. He
led the league with 17.7 points per game and established a school
record for career 3-point field goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   His credentials were solid, but when he wasn't taken in the '97
NBA draft or invited to anyone's camp for an extended tryout,
Garnett, an honorable-mention McDonald's All-American at Hamilton
High in Los Angeles, went through a brief, informal workout with
the Lakers. He played for a couple of weeks with a touring team,
didn't hook on in the CBA, then decided that playing in Turkey was
better than not playing at all with winter half gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know of a kid I've ever had in our program who's
worked harder to develop his talents,'' Santa Clara coach Dick
Davey said. ``Maybe the pros thought he was a half-step too slow,
but he's improved his speed and he's got a gift most guys don't
have _ he can shoot the hell out of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Davey, who had coached at clinics in Turkey and had befriended a
local coach, used that contact to help Garnett get a job in that
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very tough adjustment, but having Turkey on my resume
was better than not having anything at all,'' said Garnett after
Wednesday's practice at Brandeis University in Waltham. ``Unlike
other European countries, the percentage of English-speaking people
wasn't very high there. If I needed something at night, I couldn't
call my coach. I had to wait for the next day when the interpreter
was around. I was the only American on my team (Adalya Vakif) until
the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   He came back to California, played in the LA summer league,
worked out at UCLA, and was ready to cast his fate with Grand
Rapids, Mich., in the CBA. But, he said, ``something inside told me
this was my year, and my agent also thought it wouldn't hurt to
hold off while the lockout wound down.''
</P>
<P>
   The wait was worth it: Pierce, a former opponent when Kansas
took on Santa Clara, is now a teammate, and their friendship has
helped ease the transition to a new city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Boston and the people here, but I'm still getting used
to the weather,'' said Garnett. ``I know I'll be backing up two
veteran point guards (Kenny Anderson and Dana Barros), and I feel I
can come in and develop as a player. I'm more a natural 2-guard,
but because of my size (6 feet 2 inches), I've kind of molded
myself into a point guard. I've gotten a lot better at the 1-spot
since college.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ron Mercer's status for Friday's opener against Toronto and
Saturday's game against Cleveland, both in Boston, is doubtful
because of a knee sprain. ``He's probably going to sit these two
games out. I would tend to doubt he'll be ready and I'm preparing
that he won't go for at least the weekend,'' said Pitino, who plans
to start Bowen in place of Mercer. ``Ron's a big part of our
offense,'' said captain Antoine Walker. ``And he helps keep the
double team off me. Hopefully, he can get back in a couple of
days.'' . . . Pitino said he has been impressed with his team's
defensive intensity and balance in practice. ``In our last five
scrimmages, the second unit has beaten the first unit,'' said
Pitino, who joked that ``I don't know whether I should be worried
about that.''

SUNDANCE LESSONS: LEARNING TO LOVE FILM IN UTAH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN KRICH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah _ ``Wear warm shoes and don't take anything
personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Such was the warning from one movie industry insider as I
prepared to attend my first Sundance Film Festival _ an obligatory
rite of passage and shivery initiation for anyone more than
casually concerned with the future of independent (i.e.,
idea-driven) cinema in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Begun as an outgrowth of actor Robert Redford's laboratory for
budding screenwriters, Sundance has become a genuine American
phenomenon: part idealistic enclave, part networking frenzy, a bit
of left- and right-coast arrogance grafted onto the heart of the
pure West, one schmoozing party in parkas, the breeding ground for
art as much as ``projects,'' a haven for both cinematic purists and
unabashed hustlers.
</P>
<P>
   For a new participant during this year's 10-day, late-January
fest, there were some rude shocks and pleasant surprises. For
starters, Park City, Utah, is pretty darn ugly, a sprawl of condos
and malls all in chocolate brown, best seen at night when the
nearby mountains appear to loom closer.
</P>
<P>
   While the chalets most participants share are plush and
Jacuzzi-equipped, most of the venues are uncomfortably funky and
less than state-of-the-art, with films shown in the town library
auditorium, two hotel convention rooms, a small mall triplex.
</P>
<P>
   Given the capacity, tickets are relatively easy to obtain to all
but the hottest shows. Considering many are thrown by the likes of
Playboy and The Gap, food at most of the parties is sun-dried
meager and quickly snatched-up, the music loud enough to frustrate
all but the pushiest encounters, the lines to get into such
numerous affairs far longer than for most of the films and far
tougher to crash (with bouncers seemingly imported from lower
Manhattan).
</P>
<P>
   The free buses that shuttle cineastes about are remarkably
efficient, featuring the chance to run into budding starlets like
Tamlyn Tomita out of their make-up, piped-in broadcasts of the BBC
World Service, and friendly, folksy drivers who garnish their
restaurant recommendations with quips like, ``There's only so many
ways to burn a steak.''
</P>
<P>
   At Sundance, bottled water is a continuous need and celebs
aren't that easy to come by. My final tally: Ethel Kennedy at the
screening of her daughter Rory's film (a film about Appalachia
called ``American Hollow,'' Roger Ebert snapping shots of every new
director, Robert Townsend guest singing with a blues band, Harvey
Keitel flying in from Rome for the day.)
</P>
<P>
   Here, documentarians are not second-class citizens, ``Q and A''
sessions go forever, and many of the selections remain comfortingly
oddball, low-budget and often on socially-aware subjects in grim
contrast to the deluxe resort environs.
</P>
<P>
   Even at 2 a.m., as lines await the next shuttle or frostbite,
the emphasis is on the movies themselves, with everyone wanting to
know, ``Seen anything good lately?'' At Sundance, the word ``buzz''
takes on a tangible, quantifiable meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The power of big Hollywood bucks, or the prospect of potential
box office trillions, temporarily transforms this tiny mining camp
into America's media capital _ the first place West of the
Mississippi, and the only place in the Rockies, to receive
stackloads of Variety, the Los Angeles Times, Entertainment Weekly,
the New York Times Arts and Leisure Sections, even daily updates of
the on-line Indie Wire finished on laser printers in the basement
of a ski lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Posters pepper every inch of wall (though this year's best ploy
was for the low-budget ``Dylongso,'' which, in the manner of the
film, placed stakes in the snow bearing Polaroid portraits of
``endangered black men'').
</P>
<P>
   Here, cell phone and Internet services get more overloaded than
any of the lifts. ``You're breaking up'' refers to satellite,
rather than emotional, connections. And you regularly overhear
conversations that begin, ``I've just tied up the North American
rights. ...''
</P>
<P>
   All this wheeling and dealing is just dandy, according to a
presenter of Native-American heritage at Saturday's culminating
Awards Night, because Redford had been sensitive enough to ask for
the blessing of the Ute people who once ruled these image-besieged
lands. But does Sundance still belong, as one administrator claims,
``to the community of film artists''?
</P>
<P>
   The proof is in the pudding, or in this case, the
post-production, in how many of this year's honorees would have got
their films made in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not Berkeley-based Vietnam War widow Barbara
Sonneborn's ``Regret to Inform'' or the biggest winner out of
Milwaukee, ``American Movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Even 26-year-old Tony Bui's ``Three Seasons,'' the big winner
thanks to its timely evocation of a non-threatening, spiritually
uplifting Vietnam, would never have been backed by a big studio due
to its insistence on Vietnamese dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Though masterful foreign works like Mexico's ``Under a Spell,''
Mali's ``Life on Earth'' and Spain's ``Lovers of the Arctic
Circle'' go largely ignored, there are still plenty of spontaneous
boos when a Mercedes-Benz executive compares a great movie to a
great car.
</P>
<P>
   As I joined revelers in a dizzy night of high-altitude boogieing
at the Park City Racquet Club, I couldn't help feeling that the
event remains vital _ not quite the property of the Utes, but still
not entirely the property of Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Averaging three parties, four movies and five hours sleep per
day, I'd made it through without tearing a knee or getting
pneumonia, a Sundance virgin no longer, and thoroughly seduced.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- The professors teaching this semester's
hottest course at MIT's Sloan School of Management stopped taking
applications after 150 students signed up for the 76 available
seats. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Simply titled Electronic Commerce and Marketing, the course had
far fewer takers in the past. But that was before the Internet
revolution reshaped the business landscape and allowed even those
with modest resources to generate quick fortunes on the World Wide
Web. Now many business students who once imagined making their mark
on Wall Street or in consulting firms dream of careers in
cyberspace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the time when you could decide whether you would
continue building stagecoaches, or whether you would go to a
different company and start building cars,'' said Rob Bailey, a
second-year Sloan student enrolled in the course. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen it like this,'' said William DeLey, another
student. ``Everybody wants to take advantage of this new movement,
the Internet.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That enthusiasm seems finally to have created a critical mass at
top business schools, which have begun offering new courses and
programs aimed at helping students capitalize on the ever-growing
influence of on-line services and marketing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Business School, for example, has opened an office in
Silicon Valley to develop case studies for teaching classes about
Internet company start-ups. The school is also offering a wider
array of entrepreneurial courses for the increasing number of
students interested in founding their own technology firms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Sloan announced Wednesday that, to accommodate
growing student interest in the Internet, it will offer a new track
of courses in electronic commerce and on-line marketing. It also
plans to expand a separate Entrepreneurship Center to create and
sustain local technology companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similar efforts are under way at Vanderbilt University, in
Nashville. In Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University's business
school recently announced a one-year master's degree program to
train students to run Internet companies. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Hot deals &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Faculty members say the new courses have been inspired, in part,
by the recent flurry of big Internet-related mergers and
stratospheric rise of stock values in companies such as on-line
bookseller Amazon.com and Web-search firm Yahoo Inc., both just a
few years old. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The predominant view at business schools, at least until a few
years ago, was that the Internet is just another channel for the
distribution of advertising,'' said Donna Hoffman, a professor at
Vanderbilt's Owen Graduate School of Management. ``In that view,
the notion was just to make do with having a single Internet course
on the curriculum.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, high-tech firms from software giant
Microsoft Corp. to dozens of tiny Internet companies such as
Wellesley-based search engine firm Direct Hit Technologies have
come to represent the fastest-growing segment of the economy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the academics are taking notice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiters and alums are making it clear that this isn't just
a small change in the way advertising works. This is a change in
almost all areas of commerce,'' Hoffman said. ``They want people
who can understand that.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   David Chesnik, director of electronic commerce at Lycos Inc.,
the largest Internet company in Massachusetts, said he often seeks
business-school students to work on projects at the Waltham firm.
Students are ``attracted to the uncertainty'' that surrounds any
on-line ventures _ and to the possibilities for striking it rich. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Seeking fast impact &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One is Keith Law, who is finishing his MBA coursework at
Carnegie Mellon and is interviewing with companies in New England,
including several that create software to automate large telephone
``call centers'' used by banks and other service companies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Law, 25, said that he could make more money at a larger firm,
but that a role in a smaller company would be ``a heck of a lot
more interesting and unpredictable.'' His goal, he said, is to have
a quick impact on strategy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Sloan, considered one of the country's top business education
programs, the expansion of the electronic-commerce curriculum comes
as part of an effort by the school's new dean, Richard Schmalensee,
to foster more high-tech development in the area. The new program
will also include new research support. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The idea for more e-commerce courses came as faculty struggled
to handle the unplanned rush of students this semester. Each class
in the two-year MBA program includes about 300 students. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the bane of an administrator's existence, to get these
sudden shifts in demand'' for courses, Schmalensee said. ``A year
ago, people were banging on the door to get more finance courses so
they could go work for investment banks. We've never had this kind
of pressure'' for Internet courses, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Erik Brynjolfsson, who will direct the new MIT program, also
attributes the surge in demand to the growing importance of
technology in almost all segments of the economy. Even students who
plan to work in banks, financial services or manufacturing expect
those industries will be ``transformed by new forms of electronic
commerce,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While the specific Internet curriculum has not yet been drawn
up, Brynjolfsson said he would like to hire as many as four new
faculty members to teach the new classes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Schmalensee called that plan ``a wish list'' but said the number
of new faculty hires is under discussion. ``It's not like we've
suddenly received some wisdom and doctrine we can suddenly dole out
to students,'' he said. ``We're going to be learning with them as
to where this is going.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also unclear are expansion plans for Sloan's Entrepreneurship
Center. Its director, Ken Morse, said he has pledges for $16
million toward his goal of raising $60 million by 2001. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Like the new electronic commerce courses, the center will
encourage students to work on field projects for technology
companies. The contacts often lead to job offers and, Morse said,
ideas for further study at MIT. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Morse said he hopes both his center and the new courses will
apply fields like economics, finance and marketing to the expanding
world of electronic commerce. The goal, he said, will be to
``integrate the traditional disciplines into these hot new areas.''

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: Harness my dog, muzzle my wallet
 &HT;    (Fixes ending.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ I stopped by the hardware store the
other day, trying to find a harness for my $2,000 dog.
</P>
<P>
   That's Buster, the little rat terrier, white with black spots, I
found some six years ago under the overpass and brought home to
join our Family of Dog, presently numbering eight.
</P>
<P>
   Little did I know at the time Buster would turn out to be a
$2,000 dog. Imagine my surprise!
</P>
<P>
   The boys at the hardware store thought I was bragging.
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't bragging.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, you wouldn't know it to look at Buster.
</P>
<P>
   You've heard of a Jack Russell terrier. Buster's more of a jack
rabbit terrier, such are his ears.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, he has a little ``yo quiero'' in him.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, when I brought Buster home to live with us, it was love
at first sight for him and my wife.
</P>
<P>
   She still talks about that moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming in the back door,'' she relates, dreamily, ``and
he was coming around the corner into the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our eyes met,'' her voice trails off for a moment, ``and we
knew we were made for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   I, on the other hand, she sees as made of money, which is lucky
for Buster.
</P>
<P>
   Buster had been having back problems for some time. But one
morning last month when he got out of bed (yes, he sleeps in the
bed with us), Buster tried to take a step and simply fell over.
</P>
<P>
   We rushed him to the vet and soon got the report that there was
pressure on his spinal cord, probably from a slipped disk, and he'd
need an operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he were my dog,'' our vet advised, ``I'd take him to
Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, we took off for Houston, where there's a special pet
hospital for neurosurgery, as well as cardiac care, cancer
treatment and most anything you'd find in a people hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Buster had his surgery, and Buster's doing fine. Never mind that
after a week in the hospital he came home looking a bit like
Frankenbuster, what with the stitches.
</P>
<P>
   He's presently halfway through five weeks of ``cage rest''
convalescence. Buster's making the best of it, and, for a fact, the
best is none too good for Buster. My wife lined the cage with an
electric blanket.
</P>
<P>
   The reason I was at the hardware store shopping for a harness is
that Buster can no longer wear a collar. If he pulled on his leash,
wearing a collar, he well might reinjure himself.
</P>
<P>
   And the reason I call him my $2,000 dog ...
</P>
<P>
   Well, you don't have to take my word for it.
</P>
<P>
   I have the papers to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the bill from the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not bragging.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm complaining, either, Dear.

MAKIN' MUSIC A PIECE O' CAKE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Calif.) 
 
By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ John McCrea of the band Cake has a fundamental problem
with modern rock: He thinks it's environmentally wasteful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something always has to be negated. And when I think negated,
I think discarded. And when I think discarded, I think landfill,''
McCrea says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everything is useful and nothing should be thrown
away. When you throw things away, you're negating other things to
define yourself. What about just defining yourself without so much
negation? You can't survive without something to dis? You are an
emotionally pathetic being.''
</P>
<P>
   Cake's music acts as a postmodern recycling bin for pop-culture
kitsch. Herb Alpert trumpet lines intersect with wailing P-Funk
keyboards, and disco bass lines bump up against crying pedal-steel
guitars. Through it all, McCrea sings in a droll, deadpan tone that
recalls David Byrne of Talking Heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get bored really easily,'' McCrea says. ``I can't listen to
just one kind of music. At this point in the late 20th century,
where we have access to so many different kinds of music, to not be
influenced by a lot of different stuff seems kind of fearful.''
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, Cake's scavenger's scrap heap of sounds has
produced two huge modern rock hits: ``The Distance,'' from Cake's
1996 platinum album, ``Fashion Nugget,'' and ``Never There,'' from
last year's certified-gold follow-up, ``Prolonging the Magic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate that they are interested in our wares. Sometimes
I wonder why,'' McCrea says of modern rock radio programmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hear one of our songs in that context, it's always
surprising to me. I don't hear any other songs like our songs on
there. Most of the time I just hear big, chunky guitars and Viking
drum sounds.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrea says he is planning to start his own Internet-radio
station, one that would program a wider mix of music than what can
be found on formatted radio; ``Aretha Franklin followed by AC/DC
followed by Benny Goodman. I think there are more people out there
that would want that than radio thinks. Maybe there's not that many
in any one town, but if we can get people from all over ... ''
</P>
<P>
   He is hoping for a spring launch date. Details can be found on
Cake's Web site: www.cakemusic.com.
</P>
<P>
   McCrea, 34, grew up in the northern California city of
Sacramento. He was performing as a solo singer-songwriter when he
began to hear more parts for his songs than he could play alone on
acoustic guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Cake was formed in the early '90s with electric guitarist Greg
Brown (since replaced by Xan McCurdy), bassist Victor Damiani and
drummer Todd Roper. The lynchpin of the band's sound was the
addition of trumpeter Vincent di Fiore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about saxophone, and then I thought, `No. Too many
beer commercials had ruined it for me and saxophone,''' McCrea
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to New Orleans, and I realized, `What is wrong with
trumpet?' I realized there was nothing wrong with trumpet _ just
too many people may have forgotten about it. I also went to Mexico,
which was good. That `ranchera' music makes a lot of sense to me,
Vicente Fernandez and stuff like that. People think it's schmaltzy
because he cries a lot, but I think there's something very powerful
about that ballad tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that McCrea can envision himself as an earnest crooner in
any language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm bad enough to be schmaltzy. That requires a
bravery that no snickering white guy has,'' he says. ``Confessional
poetry in songwriting makes me a little queasy because I'm from a
different world. I'm also a private person. I don't think it's good
for me to let people know such personal stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   McCrea's lyrics tend to come in a stream-of-consciousness flow
in which the literal meaning of the words is less important than
how they sound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a poet,'' he says. ``I choose words because they go
well with the notes. And if I can also sneak in some comment about
something, then fine. But that's not my primary goal. My primary
goal is to make music.''
</P>
<P>
   In the publicity photos for ``Prolonging the Magic,'' McCrea and
his compadres are decked out in matching jeans, shirts and cowboy
hats. They look like a Top 40 country cover band, something Cake
most certainly is not.
</P>
<P>
   McCrea admits his ironic sense of humor might have gotten the
better of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the whole young country thing was kind of funny.
Like the jeans are significantly tighter in young country _ really
uncomfortably so, I should add. It's an interesting subculture. I
really do find it fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   While McCrea insists he actually likes some of the new country
songs, what he really likes is old honky-tonk and western swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may sound like an incredible stretch, but I really think
it's true that there wouldn't be a Marilyn Manson without ob
Wills. What Bob Wills played was really pre-rock music. So many
things about that music were, like, for the first time ever.``
</P>
<P>
   Which brings him back to what he views as the fallacy of modern
rock culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a fat, greedy society. Punk rock may look lean and
mean, but it's the same old attitude toward the world,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mean this as an insult against people. I just think
that the cultural machinery is plush. Throw away your old records,
buy all new ones! It's like musical deforestation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it ironic that punk-rock, the negation movement, feeds
perfectly into capitalism?''
</P>
<P>
   Good point. But by defining itself by what it's not _ not
punk-rock, not new country _ isn't Cake guilty of doing what McCrea
accuses other people of doing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Only by default,'' he says. ``I am trying to root that
attitude out of myself.''``
</P>
<P>
   Any other pertinent observations?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes. I take back everything I said.''

SPORT-UTILITY SEDAN IS SUBARU'S LATEST INNOVATION  
 (ADV: EMBARGOED FOR SATURDAY, FEB. 6)

<P>
   PHOENIX - Leave it to Subaru, always the individual, always
unique.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the all-wheel-drive champ brings out another niche vehicle
for a previously unknown niche, the Sport Utility Sedan. Or as it
says on the trunk of the jacked-up Legacy, an SUS.
</P>
<P>
   It's not an entirely new concept. Back in the '70s, the late,
great American Motors married a Hornet to a Jeep driveline and
turned out a brief series of four-wheel-drive automobiles. It was
an interesting concept, but not enough to save AMC from its
creditors, and the idea went down with the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Subaru, the darling of Vermont winters, has made a career of
all-wheel-drive cars, and now produces nothing but. The Japanese
automaker struck gold in recent years with the popular Outback
concept that turned a Legacy station wagon into a semblance of a
rugged sport-utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there's a less-expensive Impreza Outback as well, plus the
Forester, with a body that resembles a small truck.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the SUS, built for people who desire the snow-going,
dirt-road-running capacities of the Outback but still want the
sleeker look of a sedan. The thought of a station wagon strikes
horror in many who feel perilously close to domesticity.
</P>
<P>
   Besides looking pretty much like a normal car, though more
rough-and-tumble, the SUS will go to the same out-of-the-way places
as the Outback. Plus, it performs and handles pretty much like any
other sedan.
</P>
<P>
   That's the beauty of Subaru cars. You can drive them all week
without the least hint of anything unusual, then on the weekend
take them to the ski slopes with confidence about getting there and
back.
</P>
<P>
   The SUS takes that attribute and runs with it. It's a nice
driver on pavement, cornering well, accelerating briskly and
feeling generally tight and well-sorted out. You'll notice the ride
height is a bit higher than ``normal'' cars, but it doesn't seem to
detract from the handling.
</P>
<P>
   The Outback look is accomplished by adding to the regular Legacy
sedan some aggressive stylistic touches, including broad and
sturdy-looking bumpers, fog lights with grille covers and some big
all-season tires mounted on bold modular rims. Maybe just a bit
over the top, especially with the big white lettering on the tires.
</P>
<P>
   The Outback Limited test car was nicely equipped, with a high
level of interior trim and equipment. The exterior was stylish and
well-finished enough to merit some unsolicited favorable remarks.
</P>
<P>
   Another piece of Subaru's individualistic image is its
distinctive boxer engine, an ``opposed'' four in which the
cylinders are mounted horizontally, meaning that they fire
sideways, with two cylinders on either side of the crankshaft. Only
one other automaker currently offers this type of engine in the
United States. And that's Porsche.
</P>
<P>
   This layout creates an engine that is notably smooth while
boasting a low center of gravity. The power's OK, but fails to
match the performance of all those V-6-powered sedans available at
a similar price. The engine also gets noisy under acceleration.
</P>
<P>
   The all-wheel drive is electronically controlled, basically a
front drive with a drive shaft to the rear wheels. This is a simple
and lightweight assembly, but not as rugged as a Jeep-like
four-wheel drive used in most of the trucklike sport-utility
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the ground clearance suitable for traversing
boulder-strewn mountain trails.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't get to take this critter off the pavement, but I have
driven the wagon-based Outback in the snow and on dirt roads, and
it performs well. On the road, all-wheel drive provides sure-footed
handling under all conditions, rain or shine.
</P>
<P>
   Which doesn't mean you should beat up on your SUS, but at least
have some confidence that it's a sturdy car that can take the heat,
on or off the pavement. &QL;

IT'S QUITE EASY TO RESIST `SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE' 

</HEADLINE>
 -HNS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in the romantic comedy ``Simply Irresistible,'' actress
Sarah Michelle Gellar sums up the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't worry,'' she says, ``I won't do anything funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing funny, nothing romantic and nothing interesting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply Irresistible'' is the early candidate for most
schizophrenic film of the year. The filmmakers _ writer, director
and actors _ simply do not have a clue from one scene to the next
what type of movie they are making. Is it a comedy, a romance, a
fantasy or perhaps a cooking show?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever genre they are copying, they are clumsy at it.
</P>
<P>
   According to distributor Twentieth Century Fox, Gellar (TV's
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'') is not doing interviews for the film.
Clearly, she wants to forget it.
</P>
<P>
   Gellar is Amanda Shelton, the young owner of a small,
70-year-old New York restaurant called Southern Cross. Amanda
inherited the place from her mom, but Amanda can't cook, and the
Southern Cross is about to deep six.
</P>
<P>
   A mysterious man tells Amanda her dead mom is still interested
in her, and gives Amanda a magic crab. She takes the crab back to
the restaurant, where it climbs on a shelf in the kitchen to watch
everything that goes on in the eatery.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Amanda is a master chef. Whatever emotions she is
feeling are transmitted through her food to the people who eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda meets a young businessman, Tom Bartlett (Sean Patrick
Flanery), who is about to open an exclusive Manhattan restaurant.
Tom has a policy of never dating any woman more than three times,
because his computerized date tracking program proves that
happiness decreases on the fourth date. But circumstances _ Tom's
chef quits the day before the gala opening _ keep drawing Tom
toward Amanda.
</P>
<P>
   The film plays like the first draft of a script badly in need of
polishing. False starts, half-developed characters and pointless
events lead nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   Amanda finds the lost earrings of her mother, and they briefly
seem to be the cause of her improved cooking, not the crab, but
then that idea is dropped. In the middle of the movie, the romance
of Amanda's food makes Amanda and Tom literally float to the
ceiling of her restaurant, and he decides she's a witch.
</P>
<P>
   We never get any reason why Amanda is so attracted to unpleasant
Tom, no explanation of the man who gave her the crab, no idea why
her mother has such powers from the grave. And so on.
</P>
<P>
   None of that would matter if the movie was entertaining, but
rookie director Mark Tarlov has not a clue how to lift the leaden
dialogue of his wife, rookie screenwriter Judith Roberts, off the
basement steps. Most of the film is staged and shot like a TV
sitcom, with two people standing side-by-side in front of the
camera and tossing inane lines back and forth until you want to run
screaming from the theater.
</P>
<P>
   The acting by generally good actors is so uniformly bad _ like
the first read through of a commercial _ that one must blame
Tarlov. Gellar, who won an Emmy for her teen years on ``All My
Children'' and slays audiences weekly on her WB show, has an
appealing screen presence but it is almost lost here. Flanery
(``Powder'') who was much better seven years ago in TV's ``The
Young Indiana Jones Chronicles,'' seems to be doing a Michael J.
Fox imitation, and failing.
</P>
<P>
   In the main support roles, Dylan Baker (so good in the recent
``Happiness'') and Patricia Clarkson fare no better.
</P>
<P>
   The movie does have one mildly memorable scene in which a
roomful of diners are struck first eloquent, then speechless, by
the wonderfulness of Amanda's food. But any attempt to promote this
film as a ``Babette's Feast'' or ``Like Water for Chocolate'' for
young audiences is insulting.
</P>
<P>
   The PG-13 rating is essentially for a few suggestive words. The
movie has no sex, nudity or violence.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, Fox planned to release this film without giving
advance screenings to critics, which almost always means the film
is D.O.A. This time, the studio's first instinct was right.
</P>
<P>
   Simply resist it. &QL;

`CENTRAL STATION' A WINDOW ON WORLD UNSEEN BY HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In Rio, the trains are so overcrowded that young men
get their seats by clambering through the windows before the doors
open.
</P>
<P>
   In a train station and a city so packed with life and poverty,
no one will care about the fate of a lost boy and an old woman.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian filmmaker Walter Salles cares, and he has made
``Central Station,'' a film as poignant in its search for the heart
of humanity as Akira Kurosawa's ``Ikiru.''
</P>
<P>
   Dora (Fernanda Montenegro) is a retired schoolteacher who
supports herself at a table inside the train station by writing
letters for the scores of illiterate people who cannot write their
own _ letters of love, hope and desire.
</P>
<P>
   Dora has grown so bitter in her cynicism, however, that no
desires, no dreams for a better life can touch her.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when a 9-year-old boy, Josue (Vinicius de Oliveira), is
orphaned at the station, Dora takes him in. Is hers a forlorn
effort to help the boy find the father who abandoned him? Or does
she have something else more sinister in mind?
</P>
<P>
   Their search through the city and into the countryside of Brazil
is a journey through the poverty and religion of the nation and the
resilience of the soul.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' is not the kind of film that Hollywood would
ever make. It's too small, too quiet, too subtle.
</P>
<P>
   It's the kind of simple, profound movie that used to flourish in
Europe years ago, when the Neo-Realism movement produced such
pictures as ``The Bicycle Thief'' and ``The Four Hundred Blows.''
</P>
<P>
   There's still a world cinema that tells the lives of real people
in their dark pain and small joys. However, you have to read the
subtitles to find it.
</P>
<P>
   If the acting in ``Central Station'' appears perfectly natural,
it is a credit to the talents of Montenegro, one of Brazil's
greatest stage actresses, and Oliveira, an airport shoeshine boy
who convinced the director he could play the role. He was right.
</P>
<P>
   In Dora's lined face, we see the bitter weight of age. Josue's
searching eyes hold all the innocence and suspicion of youth.
</P>
<P>
   Salles tells their story in the simple terms of street realism,
and it's emotionally gripping. Many of the people who appear in the
film are not actors. They don't have to be. The director finds
their souls staring into his camera.
</P>
<P>
   People who never see foreign films are missing a world of
pictures for Hollywood's one picture of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Central Station,'' which won a Golden Globe as Best Foreign
Film, will open that world for you.
</P>
<P>
   One thing you don't need the subtitles to realize: The voice of
the train station announcer is distinct to that profession but the
same voice all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   Rated R for profanity, ``Central Station'' is in Portuguese with
Eng lish subtitles. 4 stars. &QL;

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The gold wedding band glinted in the barroom
light as Laurie Mahar wiped down the empty table.
</P>
<P>
   She picked it up, read the inscription. She knew the names. He
was a regular.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be back for it, she figured, standing amid the dark wood
panels of Mahar's tavern in Albany. Months later, Laurie Mahar
waits, safeguarding this symbol of love amid the more mundane keys,
coats and pocketbooks her patrons have left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Easy come. Easy go. You can't take it with you. Or, sometimes,
keep it on you.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney World collects Space Mountain casualties _ wigs and
toupees _ amid its 1,000-item daily intake of lost items.
</P>
<P>
   At the newly remodeled Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan,
there is plenty of room for lost items. Clerks tag and store
several hundred a day _ putting jewelry in drawers, coats on racks,
cash in the safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all organized,'' said clerk Rich Hegmann. ``Whadda you
got? You got radios, cell phones, duffel bags, suitcases,
portfolios. You got packages. You got scarves. You got hats. You
got keys. You got pagers. We just got one today _ how about a
hearing aid? We've had live rats, live mice _ they were in a cage.
They left 'em on the train.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food we discard. That's automatic. That would be a mice
problem. We got raincoats. We got jackets. On a rainy day you got
umbrellas. On a cold day you got gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that it? ``Bobby, what else we got?'' Hegmann calls out.
``Oh, we've had dentures. Prosthetic devices _ two legs. Today we
got an electronic acupuncture device. Ninety-nine percent of the
stuff is left on the train. Body parts. We had body parts.''
</P>
<P>
   Body parts? ``A plastic surgeon left it in a cooler on ice, on
the train.''
</P>
<P>
   What kind?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know. Something like that we don't open,'' Hegmann
said. ``If you crack it open you destroy the property.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more surprising is the cash people turn in. Hard,
cold cash. For incentive, unclaimed funds go to the finder after 90
days for less than $500, or after a year for larger sums.
</P>
<P>
   But the hand-ins boost Hegmann's faith in human nature. ``There
are a lot of honest people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Paul's Cleaners in Albany, the wedding ring doesn't surprise
C.J. LaFalce. His own storeroom contains a party of wedding gowns
left behind by brides over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know, really, what the reason is,'' LaFalce said.
``Once you get to the point where it's a couple years or so _
they're not coming back for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They either got hit by a bus or they moved to California,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   LaFalce donates the leftover clothing to job-hunting welfare
recipients.
</P>
<P>
   Pricier items are quickly claimed. Like the large diamond ring
left in the tuxedo pocket or the $10,000 necklace tangled in a
woman's sweater. Or the $4,500 wad of bills, bound for Atlantic
City, that the owner left in a dirty pants pocket.

   MIAMI _ Flat broke, with no family or friends to turn to, Mario
Acosta says he's a gloriously happy man. Happy to be on U.S. soil,
that is.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, the Cuban migrant tells a familiar story that, at
first, sounds like so many others, of paying someone he knows only
by reputation to help him escape his communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   But his tale strikes a unique chord when he reveals his mode of
transportation -- plane, not boat.

   ``The economic situation is so bad in Cuba that I would have
done anything to get out,'' explained Acosta, 35, who left behind a
14-year-old son. ``Traveling by airplane is safer and it's more of
a sure thing than traveling by boat.''
</P>
<P>
   To get the money to pay for the trip, he sold everything he had
-- his bed, stereo, all of his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   As a worker in a tobacco factory, he had access to cigars, which
he sold to tourists for U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he scraped together $2,500, which he gave to a
smuggler promising safe passage to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The journey, which began Jan. 20, was a two-legged one -- a hop
to Costa Rica, then on to Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggling via plane is one often-overlooked twist in the recent
saga of rising illegal migration from both Cuba and Haiti to South
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, smuggling has become a growing concern in
Florida, which has seen a huge increase in the number of refugee
migrants arriving by both plane and boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a marked increase in the flow of migrants to
the southeastern part of the United States, and the larger
percentage is being smuggled in,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Marcus Woodring,
public affairs officer for the U.S. Coast Guard here.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials estimate that 80 percent of all illegal
migrants, refugees in South Florida are smuggled.
</P>
<P>
   They say smuggling has been on the rise since the United States
and Cuba signed an immigration agreement in 1995 that allowed
Cubans picked up at sea to be immediately returned to their
country.
</P>
<P>
   This change in U.S. policy forced Cubans to forgo their
home-made rafts and turn to smugglers with high-powered speedboats
fast enough to outrun Coast Guard cutters.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, tales of dramatic landings on Florida's
beaches have grabbed the headlines.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing number of refugees also are turning to smugglers
to arrange trips by plane, which they say gives them an even better
chance of reaching South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggling via plane works like this: The smugglers receive a
fee, which can range from $2,000 to $8,000, to provide permits so
that the Cubans can fly to Costa Rica or another third country.
There, the Cubans are provided with a place to stay as well as with
false passports so that they can get on a plane to Miami. While in
the plane or at the Miami International Airport, the Cubans often
destroy their false documents. Once safely on U.S. soil, they're
free to request political asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Haitians also use smugglers, but they generally don't destroy
their documents. Instead, they're more likely to pass them off as
genuine.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miami airport sees a significant number of people every
day coming through with no documents or bogus documents,'' said Dan
Geoghegan(CQ), assistant chief in the U.S. Border Patrol office
here. ``The Cubans get on an airplane in Venezuela or Costa Rica or
wherever and they flush their documents down the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Cuban President Fidel Castro has acknowledged immigrant
smuggling as a pressing concern.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent speech, he said his government has asked for life
sentences for ``inhuman'' smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he urged the Clinton administration to send
back Cubans who reach South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba reportedly has captured and imprisoned 15 smugglers from
the United States over the past year who are currently awaiting
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since they are residents of the United States, we are willing
to return them to be punished there,'' Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the U.S. Catholic Conference, an agency here
responsible for helping resettle Cuban and Haitian refugees, has
experienced a big surge in clients. It expects to see 3,500
refugees this year, compared with 2,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have no money, they're desperate, they feel like
they're going to die unless they leave their countries,'' said Raul
Hernandez, coordinator of Cuban-Haitian programs.
</P>
<P>
   Just last Monday, 11 frightened Cubans washed up on trendy South
Beach just as Emilio Estefan, the Cuban-born musician and husband
of singer Gloria Estefan, was taking his morning jog.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so cold I brought them a little Cuban coffee just to
welcome them to the land of freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The men, who were taken into custody by the U.S. Border Patrol,
said they left Cuba within the last week aboard a 15-foot wooden
vessel powered by a diesel engine.
</P>
<P>
   In the year ending September 1998, U.S. Border Patrol agents
picked up about 1,200 refugees in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   They are now on track to more than double that amount this year,
detaining more than 900 since October.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard, which handles those caught at sea, intercepted
1,047 Cubans and 1,206 Haitians in 1998, compared with 406 Cubans
and 587 Haitians in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   This year, immigration officials believe several factors will
keep migrants coming in growing numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The lingering effects of Hurricane Georges continue to drive at
least part of the exodus.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the economy in Cuba has remained stagnant, while an
ongoing political crisis has paralyzed Haiti, where 80 percent of
the population is unemployed or underemployed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haitians are coming in by boat, and they are also coming in
through the airport,'' said Mark Briesemeister(CQ), a supervising
special agent for the Immigration and Naturalization Service's
anti-smuggling unit. ``They aren't usually smuggled directly from
Haiti, but they come via the Bahamas.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his unit is currently prosecuting 17 smuggling cases.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll of 1,400 Haitians conducted last year by the U.S.
Embassy in Haiti, nearly three-fourths of those surveyed said they
would leave their poor homeland if they could.
</P>
<P>
   ``With total chaos in Haiti, these desperate people don't have
any choice but to try and leave,'' said Ken Boodhoo, an expert on
Haiti at Florida International University.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say U.S. policy is also to blame for the increased
migration flow.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1998, President Clinton allowed Cuban-Americans to send
up to $1,200 a year to family members in Cuba. He changed the
measure last month to allow any American to send money to anyone in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Remittances to residents of Cuba now total more than $800
million a year, a staggering amount that helps keep Cuba's
foundering economy afloat, and in some cases also allows Cubans to
fund their escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say U.S. policy affects immigration because these
remittances allow Cubans to pay smugglers to bring them here in
high-speed boats, or however they can,'' said Mark Krikorian of the
Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank
that favors reduced rates of immigration.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Although immigration numbers are up this year, they're nowhere
near those of the last benchmark year for illegal immigration. In
1994, more than 30,000 Cubans sailed to Florida aboard rafts, inner
tubes, and anything else that floated after Castro stopped his
crackdown on citizens trying to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis forced President Clinton to revise U.S.-Cuban policy
so that Cubans captured at sea would be immediately returned to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy toward captured Haitians -- about 25,000 of whom
arrived in 1994 -- has been to return them to Haiti whether they're
picked up at sea or on land.
</P>
<P>
   If Cubans make it to U.S. soil, they're generally detained only
a matter of days before being released into society.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a plane or a speedboat have become necessities for
Cubans unwilling to risk being returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Reinaldo Mesa, a Cuban psychiatrist, arrived in Miami via plane
on Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
   He has four brothers and sisters in Cuba, who pooled their money
to pay a smuggler so that Mesa could make the trip to Florida,
stopping in Costa Rica first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the only one in my family with a college education, so
they sent me here to earn money to send back,'' said Mesa, 48. ``I
earned only US$17 a month working as a doctor in Cuba, so I can be
of more help to my family if I'm here.''

`RUSHMORE' TAKES QUIRKINESS TO THE MAX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB FENSTER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Even among offbeat movies, ``Rushmore'' is
off-offbeat, wigging and wagging without need of a different
drummer.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sure sign of a cult hit in the making, as people who
love something different fall for ``Rushmore'' and its
anti-antihero, Max Fischer. But a cult hit requires something more:
the other people who wonder what, if anything, everyone is laughing
</P>
<P>
   about?
</P>
<P>
   Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is a kid who makes things happen
even though most of them are the wrong things.
</P>
<P>
   A poor kid at Rushmore, a rich kid's prep academy, Max loves the
school even if it doesn't love him. Max is in danger of flunking
out because he spends all his time organizing extracurricular
activities. He runs more student clubs than there are students who
want to be in them.
</P>
<P>
   Max, at 15, is uniquely, passionately devoted to his obsessions
_ first, the academy, and then the school's new teacher, Miss Cross
(Olivia Williams).
</P>
<P>
   When Miss Cross explains that she's far to old for him, Max
counters, ``Yes, I am concerned that you might think so.''
</P>
<P>
   Max isn't easily put off, which is one reason he's befriended by
Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), a sardonic millionaire who isn't impressed
by anything, particularly all of the things he already has.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Blume has lost his taste for life. But he finds in Max a
compatriot, some young version of his former self.
</P>
<P>
   When Mr. Blume also falls for Miss Cross, Max sets out to prove
that all is unfair in love and war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' is an original, and so is Max. There's never quite
been a kid like this on the screen _ part nerd, part mover and
shaker _ or a movie that could contain him.
</P>
<P>
   Max would be a bit player in most movies, good for an easy laugh
at his expense, then pushed to the sidelines. In ``Rushmore,'' Max
is a fully developed character, with his strange strengths and
poignant character flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Wes Anderson (``Bottle Rocket'') has made a
personal story, a fantasy of wish fulfillment. As a prep-school
student obsessed with putting on plays (as is Max), Anderson must
have dreamed about how he could have handled the kinds of dilemmas
that smart kids can't seem to avoid. ``Rushmore'' is the answer to
his youth, to many people's.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson tends to lose control of the story in ``Rushmore,'' and
the movie drifts. But the director is so attached to Max and the
other deadpan comic characters that the drift becomes one of the
picture's most attractive features.
</P>
<P>
   You're never quite sure where ``Rushmore'' is going, and that
makes it more fun. With far too many movies, we know exactly where
the story is going from the beginning, and the rest is waiting for
the filmmakers to catch up with us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore's'' quirky humor will not appeal to everyone. But the
movie will be a major find for people who loved such offbeat
coming-of-age comedies as ``Gregory's Girl'' and ``Sixteen
Candles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' is one of those rare films of which I'd love to see
a sequel. You want to know what happens to Max next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' is rated R for profanity, sex talk and nudity. 4
stars. &QL;

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel and Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Day in Paradise'' R (violence, profanity, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Woods and Melanie Griffith.
</P>
<P>
   Paradise is hardly the word for this too-familiar tale of four
lowlife crooks/addicts who form a kind of surrogate family. James
Woods and Melanie Griffith are the ``parents''; Vincent Kartheiser
and Natasha Gregson Wagner are the teens they ``adopt,'' sharing
their criminal expertise and their smack. The movie is the kind of
empty charade that depends on sensationalizing drug use to disguise
its vapidness. 1 hour, 32 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``At First Sight'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality and nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Val Kilmer, Mira Sorvino.
</P>
<P>
   Val Kilmer plays a blind man who regains his sight. But this
fact-based drama, loosely based on a metro Atlanta couple, never
finds its focus. Mira Sorvino plays Kilmer's new love, but the
chemistry between the stars is as bleak and gray as the wintry
setting. 2 hours, 8 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Civil Action'' PG-13 (profanity and mature themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a true story, this legal thriller stars John Travolta
as a small-time personal injury lawyer who tackles two giant
corporations whose careless waste management caused leukemia in a
dozen kids. Robert Duvall is his cagey opponent. Travolta is
miscast and the movie can't quite decide what its focus is. Still,
it more than makes its case with intelligence and old-fashioned
Hollywood ``let us entertain you'' craft. 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta'' PG-13 (profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Alfre Woodard and Al Freeman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   This warm, funny, utterly engaging family film insists you can
go home again, even if you've never been there before. Alfre
Woodard stars as a messed-up Chicago single mom with two kids. Her
own mother (Mary Alice) ships her south to Mississippi to stay with
her uncle
</P>
<P>
   (Al Freeman Jr.) and try to get her life straight. 1 hour, 41
minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth'' R (violence and sex)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cate Blanchett and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This opulent period film puts a slight feminist gloss on the
early reign of 16th-century monarch Elizabeth I, showing her
transformation from a radiant, saucy innocent to a polished,
guarded ruler. Cate Blanchett gives a luminous portrayal, and
Geoffrey Rush gives her sturdy support as court politics and
intrigues swirl about. This is a really good story. Of a girl
becoming a woman, of a woman becoming a queen2 hours, 4 minutes.
A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Enemy of the State'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Will Smith, Gene Hackman and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   Recycling paranoia plot devices from other movies (``The
Conversation,'' ``Three Days of the Condor''), Tony Scott's lively
thriller keeps Will Smith and Gene Hackman on the run from big
government bad guys. A sharp cast and slick production compensate
for the movie's occasional lapses in logic.2 hours, 7 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Everest'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   A documentary by David Breashears.
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking. Even filmgoers accustomed to the five-story IMAX
format may gasp at the unearthly scale of ``Everest.'' David
Breashears'
</P>
<P>
   documentary was filmed at the same time as the 1996 storm that
killed eight mountain climbers, memorialized by Jon Krakauer's
best-selling book ``Into Thin Air.'' 44 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``The Faculty'' R (profanity, violence, gore, drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Elijah Wood, Jon Stewart and Bebe Neuwirth.
</P>
<P>
   Although most high school students might compare their teachers
to aliens, at Herrington High they really are. In this flimsy and
unoriginal but fun monster-thriller, the students band together to
fight their fate when they discover that their teachers, including
the football coach (Robert Patrick) and the principal (Bebe
Neuwirth), want to turn them into computer-generated creepies. (Cox
News Service) 1 hour, 50 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Gloria'' R (profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sharon Stone, Jean-Luke Figueroa, George C. Scott.
</P>
<P>
   A woman's life is turned upside down when she (Sharon Stone) is
forced to protect a 6-year-old boy (Jean-Luke Figueroa) running
from the mob. Stone is wonderful. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 21
minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hi-Lo Country'' R (sexuality, violence, profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Billy Crudup, Woody Harrelson, Patricia Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Harrelson, Billy Crudup and Patricia Arquette form a love
triangle in this uneven but absorbing drama set in the fading West
in the years after World War II. Arquette is miscast, but director
Stephen Frears (``The Grifters'') is an expert at building tension
that you know just has to erupt. 2 hours, 7 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Hilary and Jackie'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   Never quite hitting its intended crescendo, this real-life
psychological drama about the relationship between two musical
sisters still strikes some major chords. Emily Watson (``Breaking
the Waves'') stars as Jacqueline du Pre, a world-famous cellist who
died in 1987 of multiple sclerosis. Rachel Griffiths plays her
sister, Hilary, who swapped a career for cozy domesticity. 2 hours.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``In Dreams'' R (violence and disturbing themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   In what could be called ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' meets ``The
Eyes of Laura Mars,'' a psychic woman (Annette Bening) is harassed
in her dreams by a child-murdering psycho. For at least an hour,
the movie is truly eerie and disturbing, but an overly long
encounter between Bening and the madman proves damaging. 1 hour, 40
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Life Is Beautiful'' PG-13 (Holocaust-related atrocities)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Roberto Benigni.
</P>
<P>
   An Italian Jew shields his son from the horrors of a
concentration camp by pretending their predicament is part of a
big, complicated game. It certainly takes a certain courage to put
a life-affirming spin on Hitler's Final Solution, but Benigni's
low-comedy slapstick approach isn't entirely convincing and is
often chillingly wrongheaded. In Italian with English subtitles. 2
hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Little Voice'' R (profanity, brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jane Horrocks, Brenda Blethyn and Michael Caine.
</P>
<P>
   British actress Jane Horrocks, who can belt out tone-perfect
impersonations of everyone from Judy Garland to Shirley Bassey, is
pretty much the whole show here. The rest of the film is a fairly
feeble show-biz fable in which her blowzy mom (Brenda Blethyn) and
a seedy agent (Michael Caine) try to get this shy recluse onstage.
1 hour, 30 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Mighty Joe Young'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton and Charlize Theron.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Paxton is a cute American zoologist, Charlize Theron is a
gorgeous blonde and her pal Joe is, well, a really big gorilla.
Together they stumble through the African jungle, California and,
overall, through this remake of the 1949 B-movie with shamelessly
stolen sequences from ``E.T.'' and ``It's a Wonderful Life.''
(Knight Ridder Newspapers)
</P>
<P>
   At metro theaters. 1 hour, 55 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``Patch Adams'' PG-13 (profanity, crude humor)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Robin Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Williams plays a renegade med student who believes the
rigid rules of health care could use a few laughs. It's ``Dead
Poets Society'' with lab coats. The laughs are good, but when it
tries to get serious (often), the flick is as deep as a bedpan.1
hour, 56 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' R (violence, profanity, drug and sexual content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry.
</P>
<P>
   A by-the-numbers vengeance thriller starring Mel Gibson. It's as
generic as its unnamed, dull gray city. 1 hour, 42 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt'' PG (violence, intense themes)
</P>
<P>
   With the voices of Val Kilmer and Ralph Fiennes.
</P>
<P>
   A spectacular animated musical epic that retells _ with some
embellishments _ the Book of Exodus. Val Kilmer is the voice of
Moses, God's choice to lead the Hebrew people from slavery in
Egypt. Ralph Fiennes speaks for the Pharaoh, Moses' ``adopted''
brother. Other talent includes Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and
a host of animators. The movie is visually impressive, insistently
reverential. 1 hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' R (profanity and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams.
</P>
<P>
   This original prep-school fable pits 15-year-old Max (Jason
Schwartzman) against a tycoon (Bill Murray) in a battle for the
love of a schoolteacher (Olivia Williams). The second film from
director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson, proves that they
haven't lost the off-kilter wit and viewpoint they first showed in
``Bottle Rocket.''
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 33 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' R (extreme violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Hanks, Matt Damon and Edward Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Part gung-ho heroism, part in-your-face horror show, Steven
Spielberg's superb film shows us World War II as we've never seen
it before. Tom Hanks leads a courageous squad on a mission to find
a private (Matt Damon) whose three brothers have already been
killed in combat. Hanks' performance is a miracle of decency and
subtle emotion, but kudos all 'round here. 2 hours, 50 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``hakespeare in Love'' R (sexuality, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth Paltrow and Geoffrey Rush.
</P>
<P>
   Poor, overworked Will Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) has to finish
his play ``Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter'' and try to win
the hand of noblewoman Viola (Gwyneth Paltrow) in this witty comedy
that uses some of the Bard's more outrageous plot devices. The
script's cleverness can sometimes get in the way of genuine
feeling, but its ambition is refreshing. 2 hours, 2 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``She's All That'' PG-13 (profanity, sexual innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Freddie Prinze Jr., Rachael Leigh Cook.
</P>
<P>
   High school star Zack (Freddie Prinze Jr.) accepts a bet to turn
geeky Laney (Rachael Leigh Cook) into a prom queen, and falls in
love with her. An amusing, genial reworking of ``Pygmalion,'' the
comedy has one big problem: Its leads are beautiful, but distant. 1
hour, 37 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``A Simple Plan'' R (profanity, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton and Bridget Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   Anything but simple, this is a character-driven black comedy
with some powerful moral-qualm undercurrents. In the deep snows of
rural Minnesota, two brothers (Bill Paxton, Billy Bob Thornton) and
a pal (Brent Briscoe) find a downed plane with $4 million in cash.
Their ``simple plan'' to split the money leads to a chain of
increasingly disastrous events. 1 hour, 57 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Stepmom'' PG-13 (profanity, adult themes)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts play competing moms _ one
biological, the other step _ in this comedy/weepie that tackles
some complex ``blended family'' issues, then cops out by giving a
character a fatal disease. Still, the sturdy cast does much to
redeem the mush-headed script (add Ed Harris in the dishonest role
of doting dad who somehow never sees his kids). 2 hours. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Crazy'' R (sexuality, profanity, drug references)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly and Bill Nighy.
</P>
<P>
   A brilliantly acted comedy with poignant undertones. Twenty
years after giving in to factions, jealousies and divine
intervention, a fictional '70s British rock group named Strange
Fruit attempts a reunion tour. The movie is both a celebration and
an elegy, telling us that rock 'n' roll dreams die hard. The
ensemble cast is terrific, with Bill Nighy a standout as the lead
singer. 1 hour, 36 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Something About Mary'' R (profanity and comic sexual
content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller, Matt Dillon and Cameron Diaz.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Stiller plays Ted, a nerdy high school senior who suffers a
bathroom mishap that keeps him from attending his prom with the
class golden girl (Cameron Diaz). Thirteen years later, the
still-obsessed Ted hires a gumshoe (Matt Dillon) to track her down.
The movie is liberating in its scatological, slapstick way.1 hour,
58 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Thin Red Line'' R (profanity and war violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sean Penn, Jim Caviezel, Nick Nolte, Woody Harrelson
and Adrien Brody.
</P>
<P>
   Less a war movie than a meditation on life, death, love, hate,
man and nature. Terrence Malick puts his unmistakable stamp on the
drama of an Army division's struggle to capture Guadalcanal from
the Japanese during World War II. Fueled with voice-overs, gorgeous
images and sudden violence, it's superbly strange, an epic that
feels intimate but distant at the same time. 2 hours, 50 minutes.
B-
</P>
<P>
   ``T. rex: Back to the Cretaceous'' Not rated
</P>
<P>
   Starring Liz Stauber and Peter Horton.
</P>
<P>
   The new IMAX film has awesome special effects but, as a
fictional story, is too short. Ally Hayden (Liz Stauber) is a
budding teenage paleontologist who wants to go on a dig with her
dino-hunting dad (Peter Horton). When her dad brings what could be
a dinosaur egg into his lab, Ally, alone with it, accidentally
cracks it and is thrust back in time 65 million years, when the big
beasts roamed the Earth. 40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Varsity Blues'' R (profanity, sexuality, nudity, substance
abuse)
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Van Der Beek and Jon Voight.
</P>
<P>
   James Van Der Beek plays a high school football player in this
insulting mix of beery teenage humor and rampant sexuality. 1 hour,
40 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking Ned Devine'' PG (sexual themes, nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Bannen and David Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   A broad, twinkly Irish comedy about what happens in a tiny
village when it's discovered that one of the residents is the
holder of a lottery ticket worth nearly $7 million. The movie is a
little too eager to please, a little too Lucky Charms Irish. But
the two leads, devilish old-pro codgers Ian Bannen and David Kelly,
are practiced charmers, and there are lots of winning little
moments along the way.1 hour, 30 minutes. B-

<P>
   This Internet-era update of ``The Shop Around the Corner'' stars
Tom Hanks as a book-chain magnate and Meg Ryan as the small-store
owner he's putting out of business. Little do they know that
they're each other's e-mail sweethearts. ``Sleepless in Seattle''
director Nora Ephron gets the charm working again in a remake that

 &HT;    Junkie flick substitutes shock for plot
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the not-very-subtle irony of the title doesn't tip you off,
maybe the director will. ``Another Day in Paradise'' is another
showy but empty effort from Larry Clark, who previously gave us the
showy but empty ``Kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The sizzle in ``Kids'' was teen-sex chic; the sizzle here is
needle chic. As in lots and lots and lots of shots of characters
shooting up. But as was true of ``Permanent Midnight,'' ``Rush''
and countless others, ``Paradise'' goes under the skin as a
hide-your-eyes shortcut to getting under our skin. It's quick-fix
filmmaking in which the sensationalistic aspect of drug use is
employed to divert us from a familiar plot, cliched characters and
a junkie movie junked up with stuff we've already seen in other,
better movies.
</P>
<P>
   Mel (James Woods) and Sid (Melanie Griffith) are seasoned
small-time crooks/addicts who have been together for years but
haven't been able to have children. They ``adopt'' Bobbie (Vincent
Kartheiser) and Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagner), a young couple
taking their first tentative steps into a life of crime and smack.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who co-produced, gets many opportunities to show off his
trademark abusive intensity. He's still brilliant at it, a virtuoso
of violent paranoia. But we've seen it in movies dating back to
``The Onion Field'' (1979). Here, thanks to Clark's inept
direction, Woods' anarchic operatics have no place to go.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who will continue to be identified as Natalie Wood's
daughter until she chooses some better scripts, again plays a
nubile young idiot, just as she did in ``Two Girls and a Guy'' and
``First Love, Last Rites.'' She's certainly pretty, and she may
even have talent. What she needs is a new agent.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's saving grace is Griffith. Since getting a little
respect for ``Working Girl'' a decade ago, her career has gone
through major ups and downs. Here, she plays the earth
mother/junkie role that Julianne Moore had in ``Boogie Nights,''
and she does a bang-up job. Whether dispensing black beauties or
chicken soup, toting a big gun or a dainty little needle, she
commands our attention with a tough-tender portrayal that rarely
makes a wrong step.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Day in Paradise'' does Griffith a big favor. I wish it
did something for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another Day in Paradise''
</P>

   Grade: D+
</P>
<P>
   Starring James Woods and Melanie Griffith. Directed by Larry
Clark. Rated R for violence, language and drug use. At Lefont

   The verdict: Paradise is hardly the word for it.

 &HT;    `Payback' never pays off
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Payback'' plays like it looks: cheap, tired, bleached out.
</P>
<P>
   Screenwriter Brian Helgeland makes his directing debut by
shooting this Mel Gibson vehicle in grainy shades of blue and gray.
This bad-film-stock look reinforces the feeling that we're seeing
something that's already been through the projector too many times.
</P>
<P>
   True enough. This is a remake of John Boorman's much better
``Point Blank''; the new version never justifies the revisit. Going
the anti-hero route, Gibson plays Porter, a career thief who heists
$140,000 with his junkie wife (Deborah Kara Unger) and friend Val
(Gregg Henry). They promptly double-cross him and leave him for
dead.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but he isn't. Returning with a vengeance, he's determined to
track down Val and retrieve his $70,000 cut of the money. That
means infiltrating an organized crime ring called the Outfit, with
help from one of Hollywood's standard-issue high-class hookers with
a 24-karat ticker. This one goes by the name of Rosie (Maria
Bello).
</P>
<P>
   Helgeland, whose uneven screenwriting record includes both
``L.A. Confidential'' and ``The Postman,'' doesn't seem to know
what his movie is. It starts off grim but has flashes of humor and
turns almost farcical in climactic shootouts and explosions.
</P>
<P>
   On top of a wobbly tone, the script cheats and takes easy
shortcuts. We're never in doubt that Gibson's Porter has what it
takes to take down the bad _ or at least worse _ guys. Though in
one scene he'll get beaten to a pulp and in the next he seems
superhuman and invincible. Or at least invisible. He sneaks inside
a fortified, mob-run hotel or slips under a car in broad daylight
to fiddle with its gas line _ while the car is full of the men who
are specifically there to kill him. Helgeland doesn't try to make
these scenes plausible; he just assumes we're supposed to believe
it. Nah.
</P>
<P>
   Porter is one of those one-name guys with a mysterious past and
no discernible character traits. He's probably supposed to be
iconic. But he's a blank point in a stylized city that's neither
Chicago nor New York; it's just a generic, gray metropolis. You
can't tell whether the movie is trying to deconstruct this kind of
gangster flick or is just failing to make it specific, believable
and fun.
</P>
<P>
   The casting is weirdly uneven. James Coburn and Kris
Kristofferson offer some scenery-chewing menace as two members of
the Outfit, while William Devane recycles his suave-thug
performance. Henry makes a standard-issue, sadistic villain, and
Bello is about as believable a hooker as Shirley MacLaine in
``Sweet Charity.'' For that matter, Gibson just doesn't make a
great bad dude. It's a relief when his usual charm leaks through.
</P>
<P>
   David Paymer as a weaselly, small-time hood is a plus, and so is
Tony-winning stage actor John Glover as one of Devane's henchmen.
Best of all is Lucy Liu of ``Ally McBeal,'' in a variation of Famke
Janssen's S&AMP;M killer role in ``GoldenEye.'' Liu plays a dominatrix
who gets turned on by violence. When somebody threatens to shoot
out the brains of a trick lying in bed with her, her comic,
thrilled reaction gives the movie its own good laugh.
</P>
<P>
   At least she's having fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson and Gregg Henry. Rated R for strong
violence, language and drug and sexual content.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 42 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A by-the-numbers revenge thriller.

 &HT;    A fun fable, a captivating Bill Murray
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When 15-year-old prep school student Max Fischer (Jason
Schwartzman) gets ready to tell a woman that her husband is
sleeping around on her, he's considerate enough to first offer her
a choice of sandwiches and beverage.
</P>
<P>
   That tells you something about Max, the irksome yet weirdly
ingratiating hero of ``Rushmore.'' This wonderfully eccentric
comedy is the second film from director Wes Anderson, who co-wrote
the script with Owen Wilson. They also made ``Bottle Rocket'' in
1996. (Nobody saw it; go rent it.) The new movie proves that they
haven't lost the offbeat wit and skewed viewpoint that made their
first one such a nice surprise.
</P>
<P>
   A 10th-grade scholarship student at Rushmore Academy, Max
devotes himself to every extracurricular activity offered: martial
arts, the debate team, beekeeping, whatever. He's very proud of his
fencing skills. And he runs the school's theater club (``The Max
Fischer Players''), directing a gritty stage version of ``Serpico''
or, better yet, a Vietnam drama complete with live explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Max's grade-point average dwindles in direct
proportion to the number of hobbies he's juggling.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares about grades? One of Rushmore's benefactors, a
steel tycoon named Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), recognizes a kindred
spirit in the gung-ho Max. He even helps underwrite Max's latest
project: the construction of a massive aquarium on Rushmore's
baseball diamond. Max comes up with the project because he's
smitten with a first-grade teacher, Miss Cross (Olivia Williams),
who happens to like fish.
</P>
<P>
   The friendship between student and businessman hits a pothole
when Blume falls in love with Miss Cross as well, setting Max off
on a campaign of underhanded, dangerous pranks. These, in turn,
incite retaliatory strikes from Blume. (Bees, bikes and brake fluid
all play a part in the guys' private war.)
</P>
<P>
   Director Anderson understands that prep school isn't just a
place, it's a state of mind that can be found in the skull of a
middle-aged man like Blume. (We see him early in the movie,
floating to the bottom of his pool to escape a party at his own
house; he's like a grown-up Benjamin from ``The Graduate.'') Blume
and Max are perfectly matched opponents, two lovelorn idiots whose
obsession isolates them from the ``normal'' world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' itself unfolds in a parallel universe removed from
the ``reality'' of other movies. It's a fable, complete with
theatrical curtains that sweep open for each new chapter of the
comedy. Scriptwriters Anderson and Wilson create their own sort of
dream logic, populating their tale with pungent, unexpected
characters. Max's best pal is a pipsqueak underclassman named Dirk
(Mason Gamble), while his nemesis is a classmate named Magnus
(Stephen McCole), a Scottish lad missing part of an ear. And Max's
dad is a doting, supportive barber, played by Seymour Cassel.
</P>
<P>
   The movie corrals its characters for an ending that has the
all's-well sparkle and shapely resolution of a Shakespearean
comedy. Its vision of romantic fulfillment manages to be both
tongue in cheek and heartfelt.
</P>
<P>
   In its stylistic exaggerations, ``Rushmore'' gets closer to the
truth about high school than all the ``realistic'' teen comedies at
the multiplex (``Varsity Blues,'' ``She's All That,'' etc.). It
captures the heady solipsism of being a teenager, the time when
anything seems possible and love feels like a matter of life and
death. Newcomer Schwartzman strikes all the right notes, making Max
obnoxious but never losing our sympathy, even at his chain-smoking
brattiest. Williams brings emotional shading to what could have
been a thankless role, the idealized object of affection.
</P>
<P>
   But the best work is Murray's. He plays the balding, defeated
Blume with a melancholy delicacy that's both moving and very funny.
His performance is like the movie itself _ captivating, original
and unlike anything else you've seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and Olivia Williams.
Rated R for language and brief nudity. 1 hour, 33 minutes
</P>
<P>
   A delightful comedy of bad manners.
</P>
<P>

PRIDE COMETH BEFORE A FALL AT RESALE STORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURI NOTARO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - You always go in with a lot of high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   You always enter the resale clothing shop confident that once
you place the pile of once-favorite apparel on the counter, sirens
will sound. Bells will go off. The salespeople will gather around
your heap of clothing, emitting gasps of wonder and small cries.
They, like you, will understand this collection to be the Holy
Grail of used and slightly soiled clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, as the door swung open and I entered the store, I got
the feeling I was a little out of place. I realized I was the only
one in the entire establishment with hair that wasn't the color of
a Teletubbie, and I suddenly felt self-conscious that none of my
facial features were impaled with a skewer the size of a shish
kebab or tire iron.
</P>
<P>
   As I took a number and waited my turn, I looked around and
immediately noticed that most of the merchandise was so skimpy and
little I thought I was in Baby Gap. As I picked up a shirt the size
of my mouse pad, I suddenly had this feeling that I was a genetic
freak, the only one in the universe ever to hit puberty or grow
back fat.
</P>
<P>
   My fears were alleviated, however, when the sales associate
began sorting through my stuff, and placed item after item in the
good pile. With each piece of clothing that made the grade, my
heart did a little jump. I pitied the one little tank top that the
sales girl placed to the side, a raggedy little thing I almost used
the day before to refinish a door.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the obvious quality of the other clothes, I felt
embarrassed by the tank top, and decided to vocalize my apologies
for making the sales girl waste a quarter-second of her time to
look at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now how did THAT get in there?'' I said as I pointed to it.
``That must be my husband's!''
</P>
<P>
   She looked at me blankly from under her lime-green bangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one, I'll take,'' she said, motioning to the rag, then
turned her attention to the big pile. ``That's the stuff I don't
want.''
</P>
<P>
   She took this opportunity to say aloud which items were being
rejected, and that's when I understood I had a better chance being
voted the Fiesta Bowl Queen or finding the winning Powerball ticket
tucked under my bra strap than I did of getting a girl with a bobby
pin rammed through her lower lip to say anything but ``Pass.''
</P>
<P>
   One by one, she lifted garments from the original pile with
pinched fingers and placed them in the reject pile. I saw them all
sail through the air _ skirts, shirts and pants I had once worn
proudly that were now vibrant indicators that I didn't have any
better fashion sense than Kathie Lee Gifford. The stuff I wore in
public three months ago now couldn't fetch three bucks at the
resale auction block.
</P>
<P>
   Humiliated, I felt as if there was a spotlight shining on me
that stripped away my current identity and immediately launched me
back into 10th grade, when I showed up on the first day of school
wearing gauchos and rainbow suspenders when everyone else looked
like Olivia Newton John in the last scene of ``Grease.''
</P>
<P>
   Pass. Pass. Pass.
</P>
<P>
   As I stood at the counter, I became aware that because I do not
dress like Dharma, a Spice Girl or one of the bulimics from
``Friends,'' I have become a frump, and I seriously debated with
myself whether I should tell the bobby-pin girl that these were
really my mother's clothes when she was a secretary for an
orthopedic doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, a vision popped into my head, a flashback from several
nights before when my husband and I were watching ``Seinfeld''
re-runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' he said with a faint little chuckle, ``when we
first met, you reminded me of Elaine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really?'' I said, taking it as a compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' he continued. ``But now you remind me of the wife on
`Everybody Loves Raymond.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As the bobby-pin girl pushed my mass of rejected dork clothes
toward me, she wore an expression that plainly said, ``Tell me
again why you thought your stuff was so cool you could bring it
here and I'd give you money for them. I am bored by your clothes.
And I am bored by you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's, um, Escada,'' I said, trying to override my
humiliation by pointing to a pair of slacks lying crumpled and
defeated at the top of the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I saw that,'' she said in monotone, scratching the
tattoo on her upper arm as her dead eyes stared at me. ``Eswardo?
They have that at Target now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``ESCADA,'' I said bluntly, knowing full well that although I
bought them at the Nordstrom outlet for 13 bucks, at retail they
demand $400. I also seriously doubted that you could pick up a
Coleman lantern, a package of Twizzlers and an Escada outfit all at
the same place in a strip mall.
</P>
<P>
   She looked at them again, and I was sure that once she realized
her mistake, she'd pair it with the dust-cloth tank top and I'd be
somewhat vindicated. Scouring the pants in her hands with her eyes,
she nodded her head approvingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are nice,'' she admitted, ``and I'd probably take them
if they weren't stained.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're stained?'' I answered unbelieving. ``Where? I don't
see any stains!''
</P>
<P>
   She sighed and opened the slacks from the waistband, splaying
the diameter as far as it would go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right here,'' she said as she pointed to it. ``In the
crotch.''
</P>
<P>
   I gasped as my face flushed red. Honestly, I'd never even worn
the pants, though apparently someone had, which explained a whole
lot of how I got a $400 pair of pants for 13 bucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not taking any of this stuff?'' I asked, pointing to
the big pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she replied. ``That's all winter wear _ ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's FEBRUARY,'' I reminded her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides the pants with the crotch stain,'' she finished.
``Would you like cash or credit for the tank top?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How much for cash?'' I asked, now defeated and gathering my
clump of rejects.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dollar twenty-five,'' she answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credit then,'' I said, walking over to the closest rack and
pulling a shirt off a hanger. ``I need to refinish a door.'' &QL;

   PHOENIX - Here's the Bill Murray theory of tipping: 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That system of matching the tip to the bill probably works
better if you're already a rich movie star. But it's the system
Murray taught the young star and director of the comedy
``Rushmore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we set off on our publicity tour of the country, Bill
gave us a thousand dollars for tip money,'' ``Rushmore'' star Jason
Schwartzman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him if the money was for both of us,'' ``Rushmore''
director Wes Anderson interjected. ``Bill said, `Yes, but Jason is
really in charge of it.' Jason sent his $500 back, but I've got
mine in my pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also has a potential cult hit in his pocket. The
offbeat ``Rushmore'' is about a prep school nerd who, instead of
being ineffectual like most movie dweebs, has the school wired.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson must have Hollywood wired because he convinced the
Disney Studio to put up $10 million to make a strange movie whose
humor is an acquired taste that many people may never acquire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a weird movie, too,'' Anderson said of the film
he wrote and directed. ``I thought we would have a lot of trouble
after ``Bottle Rocket'' (his first film) didn't make any money for
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for some reason this movie had several people who wanted
to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those people was Joe Roth, the decision maker at Disney
when it comes to movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had Joe's support,'' Wes said. ``I don't know that we had
any other support there, but Joe's word was enough.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushmore'' was cheap to make compared with the $35 million
that's now average for a studio film. ``We were too small for
anyone to bother us,'' Anderson said happily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the kind of movie where they tell you who to cast.
They were just taking a shot at an unusual movie. Disney gave us
the green light, and Bill Murray was a bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I showed the movie to Joe when it was finished, and he said,
`Great, let's release it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect situation,'' the director speculated. ``I
keep waiting for what it's like when you get in trouble. Sometime
that has to happen. But so far it's been good.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming calamity is what ``Rushmore'' is all about, as
Schwartzman, a first-time actor, creates a winning character out of
Max Fisher, the competent nerd.
</P>
<P>
   ``The script was funny,'' Schwartzman said. ``But we wanted to
be serious about it. To Max, none of it is a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Schwartzman gave to the character, Max gave something
back to the actor.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got back from making the movie, I was more confident in
myself as a person,'' he said. ``I'd done something I was proud of
and felt good about. People thought I was beinQ:f`ooX7t,f''VLp5u.]

GIVE   `ANTZ' A   CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ DreamWorks launched ``Antz'' as a pre-emptive
strike against Disney's ``A Bug's Life.'' Ultimately, Disney won
out in the battle of animated insects, taking in $154 million and
counting, while ``Antz'' took in about $90 million. Not bad,
though, and now if you opted only to see the other insect movie,
``Antz'' is out on video next Tuesday along with two other notable
films _ ``Next Stop Wonderland'' and ``Rounders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ants, as you know, work as part of the collective, and their
social roles are determined at birth _ soldier ants and worker
ants. The theme of ``Antz'' is the search for individuality,
personified in Z (hence the z in the title). Voiced by the king of
neurotics, Woody Allen, Z complains that he feels overlooked as a
middle child in a ``family of 5 million.'' Meanwhile his best
friend, Weaver (Sylvester Stallone) gets the glory and the girl,
Azteca (Jennifer Lopez).
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun of ``Antz'' is that it echoes Allen's early
films like ``Sleeper,'' ``Bananas'' and ``Love and Death.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Allen's characters in those three films, Z is a
dissatisfied but affable bumbler who has no real political or
social conscience. His only real motivation in life is to find a
woman. Of course, he does, and of course, she is out of his league
_ in this case Princess Bala (Sharon Stone). Infatuated, he
convinces Weaver to switch places with him for a day, which, as in
the other films, puts him in destiny's path. This time, a sinister
plot by the leader of the ants' military forces, Gen. Mandible
(Gene Hackman). He soon becomes the lightning rod for a workers'
revolt (``All we are saying is give Z a chance'').
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Disney has upped the ante in
animation, and ``Antz'' is quite remarkable visually. There's a
wonderful feeling of depth to the animation, and somehow the ants
all look alike and different at the same time. There are subtle
traits of the characters that make them resemble the actors who are
voicing them. The rest of the cast is impressive, including
Christopher Walken, Dan Aykroyd, Jane Curtin, Anne Bancroft and
Danny Glover.
</P>
<P>
   The humor in ``Antz'' is sophisticated enough for adults, and
most of it isn't over the heads of kids. And, hey, maybe they'll
even let you watch it with them.
</P>
<P>
   `Next Stop Wonderland': For those of us who believe in destiny,
there are films like ``Sleepless in Seattle,'' which some like to
call ``chick flicks.'' I know guys who wouldn't be caught dead
renting anything that didn't have ``Lethal'' in the title.
``Shakespeare in Love'': Which two words don't work here? Hey guys,
our penchant for lists and labels is just too limiting. And it's
nearing Valentine's Day. So rent ``Next Stop Wonderland,'' and
watch it with your significant other.
</P>
<P>
   This charming indie film tells the story of a nurse, Erin (Hope
Davis), and an ex-plumber-turned-biology-student, Alan (Alan
Gelfant), whose paths will inevitably meet. Along the way, however,
they continually meet Mr. and Ms. Wrong while wondering if there is
such a thing as Mr. or Ms. Right.
</P>
<P>
   Though not without flaws, ``Wonderland's'' strong performances
and light humor make it enjoyable. And you know, guys, if you make
the suggestion to watch it, your significant other may even think
you're, well, charming. Bonus: It has a terrific bossa nova
soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`Rounders': Reasons to watch ``Rounders'': Edward Norton. Actually
it's a pretty entertaining film, and John Dahl (``The Last
Seduction'') keeps the action moving in this story of a
poker-player-turned-law school-student (Matt Damon) who returns to
the high-stakes tables in order to help out his buddy, Worm
(Norton), who is in debt to a seedy Russian gambler, Teddy KGB
(John Malkovich).
</P>
<P>
   The film's ending is too pat, but the poker games are fun to
watch. Besides, Norton gives a performance that shows why he may be
the best among Hollywood's younger actors. &QL;

WHEN GUITARISTS FRET, REPAIR WHIZ GOES TO WORK

   LOS ANGELES _ Tina Wood's journey from Britain to Los Angeles
ended the way so many others have when her band broke up and she
was left stranded under the big orange sun.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike others who've found themselves in a similar position,
Wood's story has a happy ending. Thanks to training and experience
in guitar-making, repair and electronics, the Valley resident
landed on her feet and is today among the most sought-after guitar
technicians in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Wood spends her days at one of several Valley music shops where
she repairs, builds and retools guitars and basses _ the Amp Shop,
Splash, the L.A. Bass Exchange and Cassels _ and clients range from
beginners to busy session pros.
</P>
<P>
   She's as much a star as some of her customers. In an era where
music stores are impersonal supermarkets of electronic gear, Wood
takes an artisan's approach to her craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina's real meticulous, careful, and she cares about what she
does,'' said guitarist Al McKay of Earth, Wind &AMP; Fire, one of
Wood's repeat clients. ``She may be hired to do one particular job,
but if she spots something else that needs to be done _ like a
button is missing or something _ she'll replace it for free. She's
definitely one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 years ago that Wood's band scored a record deal that
took them to Los Angeles. A year later, the group was in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I had something to fall back on,'' Wood said. ``I've
always been intrigued by guitars. I really enjoy working on them
and playing them. It's just creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood currently plays in two groups: Phantom Blue (on the Web at
www.phantomblue.com) and the Bud Lite backing band. The former
outfit appears March 21 at the Gig in West Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The big difference between repairing guitars in London and Los
Angeles has to do with customer attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you get more respect for your art here,'' Wood, 33,
said. ``If you do really good work and take care of your customers
and give good service, they don't mind spending the money. It's
much harder to make a living over there. And people are more
open-minded here.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Stamps, owner of the Amp Shop in Sherman Oaks, said
Wood's agreement to work part-time at his store played ``a major
part'' in his decision to open in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appreciate the quality of her work and her integrity,''
Stamps said. ``She really puts customer support and service first.
She's an all-around good person and a great guitar player on top of
that. I love hanging out with her.''
</P>
<P>
   In a town where attitudes behind the counter are often
intimidating, and a trip to the local music store can be an
unsettling experience, Wood's demeanor is disarmingly friendly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Setting up a guitar is very personal,'' she said. ``Some of
the studio musicians bring their guitars in every time they have a
session. I do the setups mostly by feel. Although the type of wood
and strings you use are important, the tone of a guitar is still 80
percent created by how you approach the instrument as a player.''
</P>
<P>
   The British-born Wood learned to build guitars at trade school
in London, afterward landing a gig at a busy music shop in the West
End.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she repairs vintage electrics by Gibson and Fender,
off-the-rack Japanese models and a wide array of acoustic fretted
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of new companies producing quality stuff now,''
Wood explained. ``Obviously, when they're pumping out a lot of
instruments, there's a lot less quality control. It's a saturated
market really.'' &QL;

WRITER COBBLES TOGETHER BOOK ABOUT AMAZING GUITARIST

 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ There are two things in these nine years I've
learned never to pass up _ an invitation to dinner at the Palm
steakhouse and a chance to see Jeff Beck in concert.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm in West Hollywood needs no introduction. As for Beck _
who appears April 17 at the Universal Amphitheatre _ a strange
thing has happened: Someone ``borrowed'' his name.
</P>
<P>
   When many hear of Beck these days, they immediately think of
that geeky Silver Lake goofball, not the great and endlessly
imaginative guitarist. Which is a shame because while the twerp
Beck's records are destined for the cutout bin of the future, even
the guitarist Beck's earliest albums have never ended up there.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody outside of Jimi Hendrix has done more with an electric
guitar or done it with so much humor, style and taste. Take, for
example, Beck's solo on the Charles Mingus classic ``Goodbye
Pork-Pie Hat'' from his 1976 album ``Wired.'' If you don't smile or
even laugh out loud upon first hearing Beck's improvisation on the
theme, maybe you don't have a sense of humor to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   There's something worthwhile on all of Beck's albums, from the
visionary ``Truth,'' ``Beck-Ola'' and ``Rough &AMP; Ready'' through the
masterful ``Blow by Blow,'' ``Wired,'' ``There &AMP; Back'' and ``Jeff
Beck's Guitar Shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck's latest effort, ``Who Else!'' (Epic), due March 16, is one
of the better ones. Just wait till you hear the sparse gem ``Brush
With the Blues'' from the disc.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, while there have been dozens of books on rock's other
great guitarists _ Eric Clapton, Hendrix, Peter Green, among them _
there's never been a biography of Jeff Beck.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, that is. South Africa-based writer Annette Carson's
self-published ``Jeff Beck: Crazy Fingers'' goes a long way toward
putting that right.
</P>
<P>
   As the first biography of Beck (available for $17 by mail order
from carsonglobal.co.za, the book follows Beck's career from art
school through the Yardbirds and beyond, while putting to rest many
of the myths that have followed the moody British musician.
</P>
<P>
   Carson is a contemporary of Beck's and worked in the
entertainment industry in Britain from the '60s through the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought Jeff was the most amazing guitarist, and I
was impressed with the way he just got better and more inventive
over the years,'' says Carson, a free-lance copywriter. ``But a few
years ago, when I was talking to some friends in their 20s, I
realized they had no idea who I was talking about. So I said, `Hang
on, I'll find you a book about him.' That was when I discovered
there was no book in existence, which I thought was an absolute
disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years in the making, Carson's marvelous ``Crazy Fingers''
contains no new interviews with Beck, whose management refused to
collaborate with the effort.
</P>
<P>
   But by means of diligent research, personal knowledge and, as
she puts it, ``the dedicated fan movement'' around the world, the
author was able to put together a fascinating and very entertaining
biography of one of rock's most magical and sadly underrated
performers. &QL;

WITH DREADLOCKS, NO SUCH THING AS A BAD HAIR DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VENISE WAGNER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Staajabu never had much love for the comb. It
conjured unpleasant memories of her mother running her down daily
to tear the teeth through her thick hair. In the end, there were
always tears and a sore scalp.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Staajabu has spent most of her 55 years trying to
avoid using a comb. At age 11, she succeeded for about a year,
merely brushing a top layer of hair over a matted mess. She washed
it regularly, so no one was the wiser until her mother touched her
head one day. She was immediately sent to the hairdresser _ who
pressed or permed her defiant locks into straightness.
</P>
<P>
   She's gone from rollers to curling irons, from the Afro to
cornrows and a shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in her late 30s, Staajabu discovered dreadlocks _ hair
free to twist and turn upon itself in thick, matted locks.
</P>
<P>
   She saw a man in a Philadelphia museum wearing them. Too shy to
ask how he grew his locks, she studied every bend and kink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fascinated by the fact that you can have hair and not
pain,'' said Staajabu, of Sacramento, who goes by only one name.
</P>
<P>
   She went home that evening and twisted her own locks.
</P>
<P>
   But her road to locking up wasn't easy. She faced ridicule from
some relatives and colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of support for other dreadlock fans, she is presenting
the second Dreadlock Conference on Saturday in Sacramento. It will
explore topics such as the history of dreadlocks, tips on caring
for locked hair, employment rights and laws protecting people with
dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   The proceeds will benefit the Wo'se Community Church in
Sacramento and International Campaign to Save Mumia Abu-Jamal, a
dreadlocked Pennsylvania death-row inmate convicted of killing a
police officer in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hardly a day passes that someone doesn't ask me about my
hair,'' Staajabu said. ``Do you wash it? Who does it for you? How
long does it take to get like that? Then there are people who don't
ask, they stare. Like I wanted to ask that guy at the museum. It's
unlikely they'll look it up in the library.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly everyone with dreadlocks has stories to share. And there
are increasingly more mainstream figures that dreadlock hopefuls
can look to, including the late Bob Marley, Toni Morrison, Eddie
Murphy, actor T.C. Carson, the late actress Rosalind Cash and, of
course, Whoopi Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   Staajabu cut her locks twice: in 1981 at the request of her
husband, who soon became an ex, and then in 1983 because she wanted
to enter the military. The third time she locked her hair was in
honor of the back-to-nature group MOVE, which was firebombed by the
Philadelphia police in 1985. Many MOVE members, she said, wore
dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   She was in the Reserves but managed, until she got an honorable
discharge, to work around regulations prohibiting that hair extend
no more than 3 inches from the head.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's conference drew about 200. This year, Staajabu said,
500 are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Najuma Oseye Munirah hopes the conference will reach out to
those afraid of the consequences of wearing dreadlocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing to be afraid of,'' said Munirah, who is
studying communications at California State University at Monterey
Bay. ``You can be proud of your nappy hair. You can go ahead to
feel the right to wear your hair this way. You're the one who has
to give yourself permission first.''
</P>
<P>
   But the fears are not so easily assuaged. Some blacks still use
the term ``good hair'' to refer to wavy or silky tresses. Nappy,
conversely, has come to signify ugly and undesirable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things we have to work through as a people in
general,'' said Tyra Jackson, 29, who sells products for
dreadlocked hair from her home in Oakland. ``One of them is looking
at ourselves with natural hair and seeing ourselves beautiful at
that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried about those who want to go (locked) but are afraid
of the adversity that they will have to deal with. I know so many
brothers wanting to lock, but have the conflict of what their boss
is going to say. People are thinking about boyfriends and
girlfriends or their mothers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (The Dreadlock Conference will be held at the Samuel C.
Pannel/Meadowview Community Center, 2450 Meadowview Road,
Sacramento, Calif., 2-8 p.m. Saturday. Admission is $12 for adults,
$8 for students and $2 for children. For information, call
916-443-3322.)

NETWORKS KICK UP A STORM FOR SWEEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1999, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Hill, the Aussie who runs the Fox network and a couple of
sports appendages for Rupert Murdoch, said it ever so elegantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sweeps suck,'' he blurted out during a recent
question-and-answer session with television critics.
</P>
<P>
   That sucking sound begins Thursday, with the start of the
February sweeps. Anyway, hearing no murmurs of dissent, Hill
pressed forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a network standpoint, sweeps are the worst thing
possible,'' he said. ``They are ridiculous. They're an anachronism.
They were invented in 1901. Ever since they invented it, what point
do sweeps serve?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just ludicrous. What happens is that we all throw our
best stuff on, it's a train wreck, and we spend our time worrying
about November, and then February, and then May, then July, then
November.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The networks needlessly burn their best programs in
sweeps months, counting viewers whose regular habits are already
well documented by Nielsen ``people meters'' in 44 constantly
metered markets and fooling no one as they try to jack up the
ratings artificially to fatten ad rates. Bummer.
</P>
<P>
   So, let the train wrecks begin.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hill's grousing, the February sweeps appear on paper to
be an improvement over the networks' feeble efforts in November.
Then again, there's ``Robbie Knievel's Building-to-Building Death
Jump Live'' Thursday night on Hill's very own Fox. If he falls
short, is it a good thing?
</P>
<P>
   Some of what to watch for in February on the major networks:
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; ABC. &LR;  ABC is taking February by storm, and don't you forget
it. The network's big miniseries, ``Stephen King's Storm of the
Century,'' is casting a shadow over much of the ABC schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storm of the Century,'' conceived by King for TV, is about a
storm-socked Maine town and a malevolent stranger. It's a rare
six-hour miniseries, scheduled for Feb. 14, 15 and 18. Tim Daly,
Colm Feore and Debrah Farentino star.
</P>
<P>
   The week will be ``storm week'' on ABC, in which a killer
tornado will rip Sam Donaldson's hairpiece from his head and drop
it on Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   All right, no, but there will be bad-weather-themed stories on
several daytime soaps as well as on ``Home Improvement,'' ``The
Hughleys,'' ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' ``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza
Place,'' ``The Drew Carey Show'' and ``Spin City.''
</P>
<P>
   Did I say ``Spin City''? On next Tuesday's show, Michael
Flaherty (Michael J. Fox) finally gets down and dirty with Nikki
Faber (Connie Britton).
</P>
<P>
   But I say the not-to-miss ABC event of the month is ``And the
Beat Goes On: The Sonny &AMP; Cher Story,'' a movie on Feb. 22. You
will howl with laughter. You will fall down and clutch your rib
cage.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; CBS. &LR;  Its main ratings grabber should be the annual Grammy
Awards show, on Feb. 24. But the major film production is a tip-off
about the age of the CBS audience. The two-part miniseries is ``Too
Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke,'' on Feb. 21 and 23.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco heiress died in 1993 at age 80, leaving behind a
$1.2 billion fortune and questions about what caused her death.
Lauren Bacall and Lindsay Frost will share the role of Duke;
Richard Chamberlain is the heavy.
</P>
<P>
   CBS has a tearjerker slotted for Feb. 14, a based-on-fact
mother-and-daughter saga called ``Deep in My Heart.'' Anne
Bancroft, Gloria Reuben and Lynn Whitfield star in the story of a
woman of mixed race (Reuben), raised black, who tracks down her
white birth mother (Bancroft) 34 years after she was given up for
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep in My Heart'' is calibrated to ensure that couples who
are gaga going into Valentine's Day will end the day quarreling
about whether to watch ``Storm of the Century'' or ``Deep in My
Heart.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Fox. &LR;  On March 2, a day before the close of the February
sweeps, Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass will open a tomb, sealed
for more than 4,000 years, at the pyramid of Queen Khamerernebty
II. It'd be great if it turned out to contain Geraldo Rivera and
one empty bottle.
</P>
<P>
   For the next two Sundays on ``The X-Files,'' series creator
Chris Carter will be peeling away several veils covering the show's
alien conspiracy mystery. Carter won't be revealing everything, but
he has promised to take the wraps off the Cigarette-Smoking Man.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are more Fox ``specials.'' We're talking ``The
World's Most Shocking Moments No. 2: Caught on Tape,'' ``World's
Wildest Police Videos,'' ``World's Most Shocking Medical Videos''
and, on Feb. 25, ``Surviving the Moment of Impact No. 3.''
</P>
<P>
   The impact special will feature colliding trains, trucks and
cars. All, says Fox, ``to show viewers how they can protect
themselves from most traffic accidents.'' Gosh, thanks, Fox!
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; NBC. &LR;  The February centerpiece is ``The '60s,'' a four-hour
miniseries Sunday and Monday from executive producer Lynda Obst
(``Contact,'' ``Sleepless in Seattle'').
</P>
<P>
   Packed with period music, the miniseries is about how the
turbulent decade affected the members of one Chicago family. It's a
small-name cast, though Bill Smitrovich (``Life Goes On''), David
Alan Grier and Charles Dutton have supporting roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Serve and Protect,'' on Feb. 14 and 15, is a two-parter
focusing on three generations of New York cops. Craig T. Nelson and
Richard Crenna top the cast.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest cast of the sweeps will turn up in a new three-hour
production of ``Alice in Wonderland,'' scheduled for Feb. 28 on
NBC. This ``Alice'' will be splashy but nonmusical. Tina Majorino
is Alice; she'll be surrounded by Martin Short, Gene Wilder, Ben
Kingsley, Peter Ustinov, Whoopi Goldberg, Miranda Richardson and
others.
</P>
<P>
   For a change, the most competitive night of the sweeps month
might not be a Sunday. Watch instead for a dust-up on Thursday,
Feb. 18.
</P>
<P>
   That's the night when ``Storm of the Century'' concludes on ABC.
But on NBC, in the conclusion of a two-episode ``ER'' arc called,
amazingly enough, ``The Storm,'' George Clooney takes his leave
from TV's top-rated series.
</P>
<P>
   ``ER'' is taking no prisoners. ``The Storm,'' parts one and two,
is partly about Ross' (Clooney) relationship with a dying boy, and
how it triggers a personal and career crisis for him.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently he decides to quit medicine and become a movie star.

 &HT;    More biggies on tap at Kennesaw conference
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kennesaw State University is not generally thought of
as a literary center, but the school has attracted some of the top
writers in the country to its annual literary conferences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had Ellen Gilchrist, Joyce Carol Oates, Larry Brown,
Ernest Gaines, Ishmael Reed and Gail Godwin,'' says conference
director Mary Zoghby. ``We started the conference 10 years ago to
bring together members of the community with our students and
faculty to celebrate literature and generate enthusiasm for good
books.''
</P>
<P>
   Next week's conference continues the strong tradition: Poet
laureate Robert Pinsky and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Alison
Lurie will be featured speakers on a program that includes
readings, seminars and workshops in drama, poetry, fiction and
creative nonfiction. The conference will be held Wednesday-Feb.12
on the Kennesaw campus. All events are free to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie, who won a Pulitzer for ``Foreign Affairs'' in 1985, will
read from her work at 7:30 p.m. Wednesday in Stillwell Theater.
Pinsky, author of ``The Figured Wheel: New and Collected Poems,''
will read at 7:30 p.m. Feb. 11 at Stillwell Theater.
</P>
<P>
   For a complete conference schedule, call 770-423-6296.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Americans abroad: Most of us, at one time or another _ usually
in the middle of a traffic jam _ have dreamed of running away from
home. Rosanne Knorr and her husband, John, actually did it. Two
years ago, the Roswell (Ga.) couple packed their belongings, rented
their house, said goodbye to their children and grandchildren and
moved to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us five years to decide to do it,'' says Knorr, 52.
``After our elderly parents died, we knew if we didn't do it then,
we would never do it. We both agreed we'd rather have an adventure
than more money.''
</P>
<P>
   Settling in a little village in France's Loire Valley, the
Knorrs found they were not alone. Dozens of other Americans were
already there. ``The number of Americans living abroad has
quadrupled in the past 30 years to 3.3 million, according to the
State Department,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the growing interest in living abroad, Knorr drew on
her research to write ``The Grown-Up's Guide to Running Away From
Home'' (Ten Speed Press, $11.95 paperback). The handy book offers
advice on the cost of living in various countries (Mexico is the
cheapest), housing, banking, health care and fitting in with
different cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Adapting to French culture has not been a problem for the
Knorrs. ``Our stress level has dropped dramatically,'' says Knorr,
a free-lance writer who has written several children's books for
Longstreet Press. ``The French have an entirely different attitude
than Americans about life. They prefer spending time enjoying their
friends and families, they take six-week vacations, and they spend
hours over lunch and dinner.''
</P>
<P>
   Knorr will sign her book and, along with her husband, answer
questions at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Barnes &AMP; Noble in Atlanta, 2900
Peachtree Road N.W., 404-261-7747
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Royal advice: Jill Conner Browne is a fallen Southern belle
and proud of it. After all, if she were not a fallen Southern
belle, then she wouldn't have been inspired to form the Sweet
Potato Queens. And if she hadn't formed the Sweet Potato Queens,
she wouldn't have talked four Jackson, Miss., women into shedding
their business attire for green-sequined bathing suits and posing
atop a float in the 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, so many women have clamored to become Sweet Potato
Queens that Browne decided an instruction book was needed. ``You
either have to have the attitude or acquire it,'' says Browne, 46,
a humor columnist for the Jackson Clarion-Ledger. And reading ``The
Sweet Potato Queens' Book of Love'' (Three Rivers Press, $12
paperback), presumably, is the way to acquire it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the advice _ particularly about the magic words to get
any man to do your bidding _ is not suitable for a family
newspaper, but the other suggestions are better than one of Fat
Mama's Knock You Naked Margaritas that Browne loves so well.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular chapters, Browne says, is ``Five Men You
Must Have in Your Life at All Times: a man who can fix things, a
man you can dance with, a man who can pay for things, a man you can
talk to and a man to have great sex with.''
</P>
<P>
   There may be one man who combines all of those talents, but
Browne hasn't found him. ``I haven't stopped looking, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne will sign her book at 7:30 p.m. Monday at Barnes &AMP; Noble
in Smyrna (Ga.), 2952 Cobb Parkway, 770-953-0966.

 &HT;    Truth tantalizes author more than fiction
 &HT;    EDs.: Embargoed for Sunday Feb. 7.
 &HT;    By Teresa K. Weaver
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day Susan Orlean is on a plane home to New York, leafing
through a Miami Herald left behind by another passenger. Within
days, she is waist-deep in a South Florida swamp with a charismatic
kook, trying to unravel a real-life mystery of passion and
obsession centered on an exotic flower.
</P>
<P>
   Her adventure was triggered by a few words: ``Nurseryman and
three Seminoles arrested poaching rare plant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that kind of headline that stops you and makes you think,
`Huh?' '' Orlean says. It was a fairly short article reporting the
arrest of John Laroche, a ``weirdly appealing'' eccentric who had
been caught trying to sneak several pillowcases full of ghost
orchids _ a federally protected flower that grows nowhere else in
the world _ out of the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything in the story mystified me,'' Orlean says. ``I had
no idea there were orchids growing wild in Florida. I really was
that much of an orchid virgin. I had no clue. And I couldn't
understand why anyone would steal them. . . . The whole thing just
fascinated me. When I got back to New York, I went to my editor and
said, `I really don't know what this story is, but I'm curious.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After two years of research and a year and a half of writing,
the result of her curiosity is a book called ``The Orchid Thief.''
Orlean, a 43-year-old staff writer for The New Yorker, took a few
minutes on a recent tour stop in Miami to talk about some people's
passion for orchids, and about her own personal passion: writing
what's true.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've written about surfers, mountain climbers,
bullfighters, but you don't always take a first-person approach.
Why in this book?
</P>
<P>
   A: When I wrote a story recently about surf girls in Maui, the
editors really wanted me to go surfing. I had never surfed before,
and if I had gone, I'm sure it would have somehow worked its way
into the story. But it seemed to me totally beside the point. And
moreover, I was too embarrassed to stand up and try to surf around
these kids who had been surfing since they were 2. So I decided in
the interest of dignity _ and in the interest of the story _ that I
really didn't want to draw myself into it that much.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Orchid Thief,'' though, the connecting thread is really
my journey into this world and my effort to try to make sense of
it. I was a character, and I felt like the story had to radiate
from that perspective. It was such a strange story, and there were
so many pieces of it, but what held them together was that I set
out to try to figure out what this crime was.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What surprised you most in your research?
</P>
<P>
   A: I set out not having any interest in orchids at all. The fact
that they were an object of desire interested me, but I frankly
thought they were weird and ugly. I couldn't imagine that I would
start to appreciate what they look like. . . . I am not an orchid
lover, even now. I resist mightily, but it is hard to be around
something that extraordinary, something that people feel that
passionately about, without beginning to appreciate what it is.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the great surprise is that I used to look at swamps as
places I would never want to go. And although I found walking in
the swamp to be pretty harrowing, I came out fairly amazed _ just
at the kinds of living things in them. . . . When you look at a
swamp, it looks like a big mush. When you're in it that intimately,
when you can take your mind off of the snakes and alligators for a
second, you can appreciate what a complicated, primordial
environment it is.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The ending of the John Laroche story itself was almost
anti-climactic. Did that disappoint you at all?
</P>
<P>
   A: When Laroche first told me he had gotten out of the orchid
business, I had a heart attack. I thought, Oh my God, how can I do
my book? And then I realized that the ending was almost more
fitting _ knowing Laroche and knowing what a fickle but passionate
person he is.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do real-life endings like that make you want to write
fiction?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's funny, but no. In a way, I find it more challenging to
think, OK, the story turned a slightly different way than I would
have expected. Given that, how do I sustain the story? How do I
make it work? Obviously writing fiction isn't easy, but it doesn't
seem like you would ever be faced with that particular challenge.
Here you've got a rock, a match and a mirror. What are you going to
do? There's sort of a battle of wits that I find fascinating. And
in this case, to think, OK, this is not the climax that people
might have expected, but frankly, it is what the story is. It's the
truth. So how do I make that still interesting for the reader?
</P>
<P>
   Q: It sounds like truth might be your particular passion.
</P>
<P>
   A: That's absolutely the case. What really engages me is writing
about real life, and persuading _ or even seducing _ people into
reading it, even when I'm not promising that it will be dramatic or
extraordinary the way fiction can be. What you can get out of truth
is something different, more subtle. I read fiction all the time
and I love it, but I have a secret desire to talk people into
reading things that they didn't think they were going to be
interested in.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What's your next project?
</P>
<P>
   A: I have to wait for my next book idea. It's a little bit like
getting married. You end up living with (the subject) for a long
time, in boredom and in happiness, and to make that kind of
commitment, you have to be really sure you love the idea. I'm not
rushing into anything.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read that Jonathan Demme has optioned ``The Orchid Thief.''
</P>
<P>
   A: Right. I'm really tickled about that. I admire him, I think
his movies are great, and . . . I think he appreciates the
eccentricity of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So who would you cast in the movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: Well, I started thinking about Nicolas Cage as Laroche. Don't
you think? As kind of an appealing maniac?
</P>
<P>
   And of course, Michelle Pfeiffer for me. . . .

 &HT;    Software program is a witless way to rate writing
 &HT;    EDs: Embargoed for Sunday Feb. 7.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here, in case you're interested, is a description of an insane
asylum:
</P>
<P>
   ``The corridors resound with the shouts and mutterings of the
patients, talking not to one another, but to voices from their
past. They wander the labyrinth gesticulating and answering
inaudible questions. Then it feels as if there's nothing here at
all but memories, and even these may be of things that never
happened. There's no real present here, and no future. There's only
this past. Whisperings and laughter. They are mostly old now _ if
you can talk of them at all. Because nothing really lives in them
except the long-dead. The past has left merely these husks and
jabberings. With its grey cells and corridors, the whole place
resembles a single magnified and shattered brain, in which each
inmate is only a wandering memory trace.''
</P>
<P>
   The passage is from Colin Thubron's novel ``A Cruel Madness,''
written almost 15 years ago. There is no explaining the magic of
good prose, any more than the experience of hearing a piece of
music can be reduced to the notes alone. With language, the words
are one thing and their effect another. But they are not
inseparable. Sound and sense are symbiotic, each enlarging the
other.
</P>
<P>
   In the paragraph above, one could point to familiar words used
in interesting ways _ ``husks and jabberings,'' for example _ or to
the way it builds toward the haunting image at the end. What one
couldn't do, with any profit, is run it through a computer.
</P>
<P>
   But it will soon come to that. Beginning this month, a software
program called E-rater scores essays on the Graduate Management
Admission Test taken annually by 200,000 college students. In the
past, each essay was read by two people, and sometimes a third.
Now, E-rater replaces one of those judges. If it can't judge
creativity, it can nonetheless flag faulty sentence structure,
loose connections in logic and balky transitions. It does something
else, according to The New York Times. It spots words it likes _
starchy words such as ``therefore'' and ``further'' _ and, on the
rationale that these are logic tighteners, grades up when it sees
them.
</P>
<P>
   You imagine the guy at the garage slamming that loud nut gun
onto your wheel. Might not be much artistry to it, but it gets the
job done fast. That's how I think of the people at the National
Educational Testing Service, putting prose on a hoist so the Mr.
Goodwrenches of computational linguistics can give it the 48-point
inspection.
</P>
<P>
   There are ideas so plain stupid you can't take them seriously.
Reading a piece of writing is an act of reflection, one mind
responding to another. It is an investment of one's time, and as
personal as the writing itself. It is not an act of tabulating.
</P>
<P>
   If technology has changed that, no one should be shocked. The
druids of artificial intelligence have been working at it for
years, the ground tilled Dr. Rudolf Flesch. Long before the pocket
calculator, Flesch's ``How to Write Better'' promulgated the
paint-by-numbers lesson that the simple sentence was always best,
the unusual word always wrong and that writing flows not by rhythm
and cadence but the clop-clop-clop of one word following another,
like the hooves of pack horses on pavement.
</P>
<P>
   Using a computer version of this technique, a high school class
in Virginia shot a laser through a paragraph of Rachel Carson's
several years ago and the results _ well, they wouldn't have put
her in honors English. The paragraph in question is the opening one
from ``The Edge of the Sea,'' often cited as an example of masterly
prose.
</P>
<P>
   The computer, though, found faults and fissures undetected by
the human ear. Her ``strength of delivery,'' it said, was ``good
but could be improved.'' So she wasn't perfect. Her use of adverbs
and adjectives was ``within the normal range,'' and her jargon
index was 0.00. At least she got something right. But a number of
her words were on the computer's ``uncommon word list'':
continental, receded, warps, glaciers, even _ imagine this _
eternal. As the computer printout cautioned, a reader ``would need
a 10th grade level of education to understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what you want about high school sophomores, most eventually
grow up and don't have to be committed to institutions. Which, come
to think of it, is where we started. There was a time when
competency hearings were held for certain kinds of people. We've
gotten out of the practice, which is too bad. The Educational
Testing Service has given some truly nutty ones the run of the
place, and they're playing with things they'll never understand.

 &HT;    The lingerie that outlasts trends is a safe bet to wow your
sweetheart
 &HT;    EDs.: Embargoed for Sunday, Feb. 7.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA_ Men suffering trepidation over the thought of
purchasing lingerie should take heart: It was a man who, 75 years
ago, invented the undergarment that looks the best on the most
women.
</P>
<P>
   According to fashion historian Lynn Schnurnberger's book, ``Let
There Be Clothes,'' it was Theodore Baer who first devised the
style of undies that women caught up in the flapper craze could
wear comfortably under their party dresses. ``Teddies''
revolutionized the lingerie industry, Schnurnberger writes, because
they were loose enough to dance in yet form-fitting enough to
provide adequate coverage and support.
</P>
<P>
   A 1924 article in Cosmopolitan magazine described the typical
Baer customer as a woman who would ``personally get enough
enjoyment out of standing before her mirror garbed in a sheer silk
teddy to (endure) any sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about enduring _ 75 years later there are styles of teddies
suited to every woman, no matter her age, shape or lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The original teddy design _ a slinky silk one-piece garment_ has
since been modified to include two-piece versions in a variety of
fabrics. They're a fail-safe for men to purchase as Valentine's Day
gifts (along with the requisite flowers and candy, of course)
because they're not too raunchy or rash.
</P>
<P>
   Margarita Mayo, a sales associate at LaRaine's Boutique in
Atlanta, said the safest route a man can take toward making a
lingerie purchase is getting familiar with his beloved's tastes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you see that your wife or girlfriend has several teddies,
buy her another one,'' Mayo advised. ``But don't buy her any style
of lingerie she doesn't wear already. If she doesn't have a teddy,
it probably means she doesn't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   Other teddy tips: It's better to err on the large side than the
small; remember, it's a gift for her, not you. And when it comes to
buying skimpy things, don't skimp; spend the most you can afford.
Also, if you're not intimate enough to open a drawer and see what
size she wears, you're not intimate enough to buy her lingerie in
the first place

`MY NAME IS JOE' IS GRITTY, ENGROSSING DRAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ken Loach is a British filmmaker who, for the past 30 years, has
carved out a special niche for himself in world cinema by making a
series of very distinctive, very bleak, ``kitchen-sink dramas''
dealing with the lives of average working-class Britons.
</P>
<P>
   His movies tend to be so naturalistic that they seem like
documentaries (though they're all tightly scripted, employing
professional actors), and their quality also tends to be hit and
miss _ he regularly alternates a Cannes award winner with a film so
dreary and pointless that it's unwatchable.
</P>
<P>
   With ``My Name is Joe,'' however, he's hit the bullseye. The
film may be another Loachian downer, but it's also an unusually
engrossing drama, love story and character study, with several of
the most magnetic performances he's ever squeezed out of a cast.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Glasgow, the Joe of the title (Peter Mullan) is a
38-year-old recovering alcoholic, on the dole but occasionally
picking up money with odd jobs and absolutely obsessed with his
avocation: coaching a team in the city's amateur football (soccer)
league.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the film traces the romance that arises between Joe and
Sarah (Louise Goodall), an idealistic community health worker he
meets cute one day on the way to a football game, who quickly
becomes his ``soul'' and a second reason for living.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Joe and Sarah are both drawn into the lives of
Liam (David McKay), a young man on Joe's football team who has
kicked his drug habit after a stint in jail, and Liam's wife,
Sabine (Anne-Marie Kennedy), who is back on drugs and working the
streets.
</P>
<P>
   The script chronicles Joe's love story, his maturing process and
the series of moral decisions he must make when he is torn between
keeping the love and respect of Sarah, and his need to save the
life of Liam when he gets in trouble with a gang of drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   This may sound like the same old ``Mean Streets'' clone, but
somehow the familiar story comes together to be an extraordinarily
powerful _ and utterly believable _ drama, and an exquisitely
poignant ode to the power of romantic love and unselfish
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Mullan _ who appeared in Loach's ``Riff-Raff'' as well as in
small parts in Mel Gibson's ``Braveheart'' and Danny Boyle's
``Trainspotting'' _ turns in a near-flawless performance. (He won
the best actor honors at the last Cannes Film Festival.)
</P>
<P>
   Louise Goodall _ who appeared in a smaller part in Loach's
``Carla's Song'' _ is just as effective, creating a character of
genuine nobility and resourcefulness: not just a morally ``good''
woman, but as strong a woman character as the movies have produced
in the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe'' is as tight and accessible a piece of story-telling as
Loach has ever given us, and it also represents a big change of
heart. While most of his films are what one critic has called
``studies in banal and hopeless poverty,'' this is a movie about
the possibility of redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Footnote: The Scottish brogues are so thick and the vernacular
so regional that the distributer has decided to subtitle the film.
At first, it's a bit disconcerting to watch a movie in English
subtitled in English, but it soon becomes obvious that ``My Name is
Joe'' would be absolutely incomprehensible without them.
</P>
<P>
   My Name is Joe. Directed by Ken Loach. Screenplay by Paul
Laverty. Cast: Peter Mullan, Louise Goodall, David McKay,
Anne-Marie Kennedy, Gary Lewis, Lorraine McIntosh. Artisan
Entertainment. 106 minutes. In English with English subtitles.
Rated R for violence and drug theme.

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When Percy Shelley's mom asks for a soda, 3-1/2 year
old Percy hurries to the fridge to grab one. And last week, when
Percy's mom yelled for the telephone after collapsing from a
diabetic seizure, Percy again came through.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers are calling him a hero.
</P>
<P>
   At a strapping 153 pounds, who'd call the St. Bernard anything
else?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you get Mom a Coke?'' coaxes 38-year-old Melanie
Horne in a voice that sends a wag shivering down the tail of her
giant friend and constant companion.
</P>
<P>
   Off trudges Percy to the refrigerator. With an effortless shrug
of his great neck, he pulls the door open and slides his mouth
around one of the cans of fruit juice stored on a low shelf.
</P>
<P>
   The can is nearly invisible, wrapped up in his big mouth, as he
trots back to Horne, who sits atop a white sheepskin thrown over a
corner of her sofa. Percy appears to attempt a lopsided smile when
she reaches into his juicy maw to extract the can.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good boy!'' she exclaims. ``He takes the laundry to
the laundry basket. In the garden, he brings me tools. He makes it
possible for me to have a sense of independence.''
</P>
<P>
   He also helped save her life last Wednesday afternoon when Horne
_ a double-organ recipient who is awaiting another pancreas
transplant _ became woozy after her blood sugar and blood pressure
nosedived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in here doing what, I don't even remember, when my blood
sugar started falling, and Percy whined at me. I took a quick test,
and I realized `I'm slipping too quickly,' so I told him to bring
me the phone, and I was able to dial 911,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When a medic van and fire engine arrived at Horne's duplex, they
found her unresponsive on the couch where Percy had dragged her.
When Horne recovered, she explained that Percy had knocked the
portable phone from its wall cradle and brought it to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't believe it,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Disbelief in Percy's talents comes as no surprise to Horne.
</P>
<P>
   Horne bought Percy from a breeder in 1995 to help care for her.
She was recovering from surgery to replace her kidney and pancreas,
and she would often fall down. She opted to train her own service
dog rather than buy a costly, ready-trained adult dog.
</P>
<P>
   The tri-color pure bred, whose full name is Percy Shelley Holly
Bluff's, weighed 17 pounds and was a quick study.
</P>
<P>
   During her recovery, Horne eventually trained Percy to fetch her
medication, grab a box of juice or can of cola and drag her
upright. She set up a non-profit organization _ Training Aide Dog
Advocacy _ to teach other people how to train their own service
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But even Horne was surprised when her new puppy seemed to
instinctively recognize when her blood pressure and blood sugar
levels fell dangerously low.
</P>
<P>
   Household legend holds that Percy was only 11-weeks-old when he
first rescued Horne: ``He was just a little ball of fur when he
actually shoved me into the couch and kept me from falling down.''
</P>
<P>
   As she talks, Horne's hand massages the snoozing beast's head
with a fist roughly the size of his big, black moist nose. Lowering
her voice to a whisper, she speaks gratefully about her dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a pager, and at any moment I can be whisked off for
another transplant, and Percy is just making it possible for me to
stay alive until a pancreas becomes available.''

SUPERFICIAL `THE '60S' OVERDOSES IN A CLICHED LOOK AT TURBULENT
TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Promotional material for ``The '60s'' boasts that ``the best
movies on television are on NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   Left unsaid in NBC's strutting for February sweeps is that some
pretty awful movies also make their way through the vetting process
at Peacock Central.
</P>
<P>
   ``The '60s'' is one of them. An ambitious but badly constructed
``miniseries'' that can't seem to decide what it is, ``The '60s''
roams over four hours and two nights the way my '60 Falcon did:
aimlessy, and usually on empty.
</P>
<P>
   Especially at the start of Sunday's first installment, as
viewers get to know the white Herlihys of Chicago and the black
Taylors of Greenwood, Miss., the film is stiffer than Grandma's
meringue, flakier than her crust.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to cover too much ground (the student uprising, the
civil rights movement, the Vietnam War, the drug culture, etc.)
with a combination of fiction and actual news footage, ``The '60s''
trivializes a key period in American history by reducing it to a
superficial, cliche-filled treatment backed by a musical melange of
oldies-but-goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of '60s music will enjoy the soundtrack (available on
Mercury Records), with Bob Dylan and Joan Osborne collaborating on
a new version of Dylan's ``Chimes of Freedom.'' But if you like
your characters richly drawn and their dialogue crisply written,
there is no compelling reason to revisit ``The '60s.'' Better to
wait till later Sunday night for a fresh new dose of the '90s on
ABC's ``The Practice,'' where you're not likely to hear Mrs.
Herlihy (Annie Corley) exclaim: ``Michael, I can't believe you left
your report card lying on the counter. For heaven sakes, I'm so
proud of you!''
</P>
<P>
   If there is a central character in this jumble, it is Michael
Herlihy (Josh Hamilton), a straight-A's kind of guy who is wholly
unbelievable as a 17-year-old but reasonably convincing as a
peacenik in college and beyond. Early on, during a civil rights
march in 1962, Michael meets Emmet Taylor (Leonard Roberts), the
teenage son of an activist minister.
</P>
<P>
   Their paths cross again in 1968 during the Democratic convention
in Chicago. Michael is still a peace activist; Emmet, whose life
has been redefined by senseless violence, is a member of the Black
Panther Party. But the idea of seeing how two families made it
through the '60s is dashed as the film spends less and less time
developing the Taylor side of the tale.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the 1960s posed difficult questions and troubling
choices. Director Mark Piznarski makes that clear as we meet
Michael's older brother, Brian, the football hero who chooses the
Marine Corps and Vietnam, and his younger sister, Katie (Julia
Stiles), who chooses to look for love and affirmation in all the
wrong places. Brought up in the civil rights movement, Emmet Taylor
chooses to tune out for a while, but then makes the choice his
father, played by Charles S. Dutton, would recommend.
</P>
<P>
   All these choices are made against the backdrop of momentous
'60s events _ the assassinations, the peace movement, the war _ as
if to suggest everyone was consciously pacing his life to the
steady drumbeat of history.
</P>
<P>
   While presidents and generals might live that way, most people,
even student activists who think they will change the world, spend
a lot of time living their lives against a backdrop far more
mundane. Perhaps if Piznarski had spent less time worrying about
file footage to establish the grave nature of the times, he'd have
crafted a compelling story with more gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, it was Piznarski who, a few seasons back, directed
the pilot episode of ``Relativity,'' one of the most stunning
series debuts of recent vintage. Obviously, you can't hit it out of
the park every time. ``The '60s'' is as forgettable as that
``Relativity'' episode was memorable.
</P>
<P>
   The '60s. Four-hour television movie about the 1960s, focusing
on two fictitious families torn apart by the decade's tumultuous
events. Starring Josh Hamilton, Julia Stiles, Jordana Brewster,
Charles S. Dutton, Leonard Roberts, Annie Corley, Bill Smitrovich,
Jerry O'Connell and Jeremy Sisto. Sunday and Monday on NBC. KING/5.
Parental guideline rating: TV-14.

`RUSHMORE' HAS TROUBLE MATCHING EARLY HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The optimum way to experience the already-much-acclaimed
high-school comedy, ``Rushmore,'' may be to discover it and go in
with the low expectations its genre _ and the film's singularly
unappealing trailer _ set up.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, after months of critical praise and accolades _
including several year-end critics' awards (and a likely Oscar
nomination) for Bill Murray, as well as a berth on many 10-best
lists _ one's expectations are high. And the film can't completely
meet them.
</P>
<P>
   It's original, and cumulatively funny, but it doesn't have any
satiric clout, it's instantly forgettable and, while Murray is
effective in his supporting role, he was so much better as the star
of ``Groundhog Day'' and ``What About Bob?'' that an Oscar would
seem an anticlimax.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the fictional Rushmore Academy, the film is an off-beat
character study of one Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), a
15-year-old barber's son who somehow made it into this posh,
private school on a scholarship reserved for the financially needy.
</P>
<P>
   Tenth-grader Max is the sparkplug of the student body,
author-director of the drama club, editor of the school newspaper
and yearbook, captain of the debate team, president and prime mover
of virtually every extra-curricular activity from the astronomy
club to the ``double-team dodgeball society.''
</P>
<P>
   His problem is that he's failing all his subjects (in fact, he's
the worst student in Rushmore history) and the long-suffering
headmaster (Brian Cox) has no choice but to throw him out if he
doesn't pull up his grades _ a task for which Max clearly has no
heart.
</P>
<P>
   With this crisis in progress, the script also follows the course
of Max's unlikely friendship with one of the school's benefactors,
a self-destructive steel tycoon named Mr. Blume (Bill Murray), who
loathes himself and his whole family and begins to see Max as the
son he wished he'd had.
</P>
<P>
   And when both Max and Mr. Blume fall in love with the beautiful
and fragile Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), one of the school's
elementary teachers who's been recently widowed, their friendship
turns into an ugly war for the lady's favors.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Wes Anderson tells this story in the same
distinct style of his first film, the moderately successful 1996
slacker comedy, ``Bottle Rocket'' _ dead-pan, absurdist humor that
resolutely avoids pratfalls, scatology and the other low rituals of
the modern teen comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson paces his film nicely: he's not afraid of low moments
(unlike most of his MTV-trained contemporaries), and he's not
afraid to start slow and build his comic premise gradually (so
there's relatively few laughs in the first act).
</P>
<P>
   A handful of his sequences are inspired, as when Max arranges
the funding for a major on-campus aquarium after Miss Cross
casually mentions a fondness for goldfish; or when Max mounts a
theatrical version of the Vietnam War, complete with
special-effects explosions and model helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a rare high school comedy that actually likes its
characters _ and gives them room to breathe. Thus, all of Max's
relationships _ with Mr. Blume, Miss Cross, a young Asian-American
girl with a a crush on him, even the school bully _ have a
surprising depth, resonance and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's not ``The Graduate,'' and it wants to be. Indeed,
the influence of that 1967 classic of obsessed love can be felt in
virtually every frame. (It even emotionally ties itself to the
mid-'60s with a soundtrack of rock music from that era: The Kinks,
The Rolling Stones, Donovan.)
</P>
<P>
   Part of this limitation is due to its star, and first-time
actor, Jason Schwartzman. He may be the son of Talia Shire and
nephew of Francis Coppola _ and he does dead-pan reasonably well _
but he's really not a skilled enough actor to do anything with this
part but pose for the camera.
</P>
<P>
   As clever and inventive as Anderson is in so many ways, his
movie also never adds up to be anything you can quite place your
finger on, nor does it leave us with any real satisfaction. It
basically works, but it lacks the shaping hand _ and novelistic
sense _ of a first-rate screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   Rushmore. Directed by Wes Anderson. Written by Anderson and Owen
Wilson. Cast: Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray, Olivia Williams,
Brian Cox, Seymour Cassel. Disney/Touchstone. Meridian 16, Neptune.
93 minutes. Rated R for language and sexual references.

ONDAR/``BACK TUVA FUTURE'' (Warner Bros.)
</P>
<P>
   I have no idea how to describe this music, but I like it a lot.
It mixes a Tuvan throat singer _ one of those Siberian denizens who
can sing as many as four notes at once _ with loping, catchy
musical tracks, Western production values and backing from guys
like Willie Nelson and my favorite dead genius, physicist Richard
Feynman. Turns out Feynman _ the Caltech polymath involved in both
the Manhattan Project and the Challenger explosion investigation _
was a huge fan of Tuvan throat singing from the 1930s on. Tapes of
his chanting, drumming and singing are worked into most of the
tracks behind Ondar's otherworldly singing. Though based on
traditional Tuvan lyrics and melodies, this is modern, accessible
folk and country music, way cooler than a Siberian stream in
December. 3 1/2 stars

BOBBY HUTCHERSON/``SKYLINE'' (Verve)
</P>
<P>
   Vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson hasn't recorded much this decade,
apparently preferring to concentrate on touring and recharging his
creative batteries. ``Skyline,'' his first album in six years,
marks a welcome return, full of energetic, passionate playing and a
nice blend of styles. The Latin-tinged ``Pomponio'' finds
Hutcherson doubling on vibes and marimba; the exciting results
reminiscent of his excellent ``Ambos Mundos'' set of a decade ago.
Elsewhere, there are beautiful ballads (``I Only Have Eyes for
You'' and Herbie Hancock's ``Chan's Song'') and three intriguing
originals, the best of which, ``Candle,'' features a sensuous duet
between Hutcherson and pianist Geri Allen. Allen provides
remarkable, intuitive support throughout this mostly mellow
session, as does drummer Al Foster and everyone's favorite bassist
(for good reason), Christian McBride. With music this good, we can
only hope Hutcherson will return to the studio before another six
years passes. 3 1/2 stars

FREE MEAL FOR VOTING RULED ACCEPTABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARSHA GINSBURG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Democratic Party offer of free chicken and
potato salad to get voters to the polls in Oakland's 16th Assembly
District race ``comes very close to the perception of buying
votes,'' but does not break the law, according to the California
secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've adhered to the letter of the law,'' said Beth Miller,
a spokeswoman for the secretary of state, who twice has
unsuccessfully supported legislation to prohibit voting
enticements.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party's decision to offer the $5 coupon for free
chicken and salad on Tuesday's special election was aimed at
precincts in the district with historically low voter turnout,
according to party consultant Bob Mulholland.
</P>
<P>
   To receive a coupon, voters in the district, which takes in
Alameda, Oakland and Piedmont, had to present their voting stubs
and a handbill announcing the giveaway at one of eight locations in
Oakland _ most of which were in low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   A broadly worded state law prohibits such activity only if there
is a quid pro quo attached, extracting a vote for either a specific
candidate or issue, Miller said. Federal law, on the other hand,
prohibits any kind of enticements for voters, but that law applies
only to federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, which endorsed former Oakland Mayor Elihu
Harris, said it offered the free-meal deal to boost voter turnout,
but denied it was intended to give Harris a big enough boost to
avoid a run-off election in the state Assembly race.
</P>
<P>
   Harris emerged as the top candidate against fellow Democrats
Frank Russo and Enrique Palacios. But with 48.7 percent of the
vote, Harris fell short of the required simple majority to avoid a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   The election was held to fill the seat that became vacant when
incumbent Don Perata was elected to the state Senate in September.
Harris will face Green Party candidate Audie Elizabeth Bock, the
only non-Democrat in the race, in the runoff next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get Democrats out, period,'' said Art Torres,
head of the California Democratic Party. ``There's incentive on my
part in every election to get the vote out.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there was no Republican candidate in the race, GOP
leaders decried the meal deal as offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found it a little bit hypocritical,'' said Chris Bertelli,
spokesman for the California Republican Party. ``The Democratic
Party claims to be the party of inclusion (that) treats minorities
with respect. But instead of going to them and advocating a point
of view, and discuss an issue of import, they decided to go the low
road and offer whole chickens and potato salad to vote.''

`PAYBACK': TAKE THAT, AND THAT, AND THEN THAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   No actor should have to mouth the ludicrous hard-boiled dialogue
_ lines like, ``What's the matter, cat got your crotch?'' _ that
lends ``Payback,'' the new Mel Gibson action-adventure film, the
flavor of a stale ``Saturday Night Live'' parody.
</P>
<P>
   This bizarre dud of a genre movie, adapted from the same Richard
Stark novel (``The Hunter'') that inspired the 1967 film ``Point
Blank,'' is set in a dank, urban no-man's land that might be called
Film Noir Manque. Here sadism rules, all women are prostitutes, the
cops corrupt and morality a matter of evil versus evil.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson is Porter, a career criminal who after recovering from
near-fatal gunshot wounds at the hands of his double-crossing
partner, Val (Gregg Henry), embarks on a killing spree to recover
the $70,000 his sidekick stole from him.
</P>
<P>
   Before he's finished, but not before a scene in which we watch
his agonized grimaces as two of his toes are smashed by a
sledgehammer, Porter goes up against the kingpins of a crime
organization called the Outfit, in a battle that culminates with
some cheesy cut-rate pyrotechnics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback,'' directed by Brian Helgeland, one of the writers
responsible for the elegant screenplay of ``L.A. Confidential,''
comes at you (not just your toes but your mind) with the subtlety
of a sledgehammer.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie's silliest scene, Porter interrupts the
sadomasochistic idyll of Val and his pet dominatrix, Pearl (Lucy
Liu), who gleefully takes over the beating up of her sleazy consort
once Porter tires of kicking him in the stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Its smirking sense of humor and generic self-consciousness
suggest that ``Payback'' would like to think of itself as a hip
descendant of ``Pulp Fiction.'' But the movie is utterly devoid of
narrative ingenuity and visual and dramatic flair. Its dark bluish
hue and downtown urban landscape (much of it was shot in Chicago)
suggest a no-budget ``Batman.'' Chris Boardman's dreary score
clouds the movie in an atmosphere that suggests second-hand
``Shaft.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, affecting his best macho growl, is at least able to keep
a straight face through the tortured purple prose his character,
who narrates the movie, is forced to deliver.
</P>
<P>
   But Henry's Val is a garish comic-book fiend, while Kris
Kristofferson, as the king of all underworld kingpins, delivers yet
another nonperformance, speaking in a dull, sepulchral monotone,
his eyes squinted shut.
</P>
<P>
   What it lacks in originality, ``Payback'' tries to make up for
in sadistic gore. Before they begin shooting and slicing one
another, the characters take cackling relish in describing the
tortures they would like to inflict. Amid the countless beatings
that are administered, one kick in the groin won't do. There have
to be at least three per scene.
</P>
<P>
   What one word might best describe ``Payback''? How about
``loathsome''?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Payback'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or
adult guardian). It has profanity, gore and scenes of torture. &QL;

AUTHOR OF `SWIM WITH THE SHARKS' RELATES BUSINESS TIPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERESA McUSIC 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harvey Mackay, the guy who taught us how to swim with sharks, is
back.
</P>
<P>
   His fifth book is ``Pushing The Envelope: All the Way to the
Top'' (Ballantine Books, 348 pages, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   The title is most appropriate for the envelope
manufacturer-turned-sage, author and speaker. Mackay owns Mackay
Envelope Corp., a Minneapolis-based $85 million company.
</P>
<P>
   Many will remember his bestseller ``Swim with the Sharks Without
Being Eaten Alive.'' Now Mackay wants to inspire us to be the best
at what we do, and there's nary a shark out there to stop us.
</P>
<P>
   The book is part inspiration, part autobiography and part
business wisdom from someone who has been working and observing
work for 45 years. Mackay takes 90 chapters to relay his message.
Fortunately, each chapter is only a few pages.
</P>
<P>
   The format certainly makes for an easy read, and each chapter
has a focused and timely message.
</P>
<P>
   Mackay quotes sources from Will Rogers to Yoda, the Jedi knight
trainer in the ``Star Wars'' movies, who says: ``There is no try;
there is either do or not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackay offers numerous anecdotes about companies doing things
right or wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines is back for the umpteenth time as an example
of the right way to do things. Can a book on successful business
techniques can be written without homage to Herb Kelleher?
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines isn't the only Texas reference, however. Fort
Worth Star-Telegram writer Barry Shlachter, who runs a Texas
products catalog, is mentioned. In discussing creative ways to
thank people, such as clients, Mackay suggests finding out where
they were born and sending them something from their home state.
</P>
<P>
   He notes that Shlachter sends ``Texan in Exile Survival
Rations'' to those unfortunates who no longer live in the Lone Star
State.
</P>
<P>
   The real jewels in this tome come from Mackay's experience as an
entrepreneur, salesman and manager, even if it is in the rather
mundane envelope industry.
</P>
<P>
   Among his best advice:
</P>
<P>
   _ Buyers don't always work 9 to 5. Some come in at 6 a.m.,
others work until 7 p.m. and some come in Saturday mornings. ``For
three hours every morning, two hours every afternoon, and four
hours on Saturday, I had no competition. Naturally, this turned out
to be my most productive time. ... I called them the `Golden
Hours.'''
</P>
<P>
   _ Take the call. Mackay says he hires two people at his company:
the president and the receptionist. ``How your telephone is
answered says more about your company than all your slick
advertising and marketing plans can ever hope to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Lighten up. ``There's no excuse for total, self-absorbed
seriousness. It's boring. It pushes others away from you. And it
requires a whole lot of energy to assume such a world view.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't negotiate with yourself. ``Once you've made an offer, if
the other party doesn't accept it, don't make another offer. Get a
counteroffer. It's a sign of weakness when you lower your own
demands without getting your opponent to lower theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep it light during speeches. ``Quiet, restful atmospheres
are for sleeping, not speaking. Be sure the lights are turned up as
high as they'll go. Audiences remember more in brightness and share
laughter much more frequently. ... And skip the slides unless
they're absolutely necessary. They're another excuse for your
audience to snooze.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's advice on negotiating a contract, speaking to an
audience or running a sales force, Mackay provides wit and insight
that comes from experience.

   ``100 Questions You Should Ask About Your Personal Finances''
</P>
<P>
   By Ilyce R. Glink
</P>
<P>
   TimesBooks, $19
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper columnist Ilyce Glink tackles the dreary world of
personal finance in a straightforward, easy-to-read style that
enables readers to home in quickly on specific issues. This book
follows the same format as two previous books by Glink on home
buying and home selling.

   ``Wear Clean Underwear: Business Wisdom from Mom''
</P>
<P>
   By Rhonda Abrams
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $22.95
</P>
<P>
   Here is another collection of great companies and their stories
from columnist, author and entrepreneur Rhonda Abrams. And, yes,
Southwest Airlines is included again, although Abrams says she
eliminated companies that always show up as great places to work.
The advice Abrams gleans from these companies is simple but true,
and often not found in the workplace.

   ``Navigating Your Career''
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher W. Hunt and Scott A. Scanlon
</P>
<P>
   John Wiley &AMP; Sons, $16.95
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-one of the top U.S. headhunters write a chapter each on
trends and shifts in the business world. Job searches,
interviewing, using a headhunter and negotiating compensation
packages are among the topics. The authors also look at seven hot
career paths, including financial services, information technology,
entertainment/media, health care, consulting and small business.

   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Niels Holst-Sorensen sits in an
overstuffed black leather chair in the Lausanne Palace hotel bar, a
clubbish old place, its scarlet walls covered with original LeRoy
Neiman paintings of athletes frozen in action visible through the
haze of Cuban cigar smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Holst-Sorensen, a 74-year-old former Danish general and
International Olympic Committee member, is astounded at what has
transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Atlanta, they gave me a compass, a compass!'' he says,
tapping his fingertips on the small cocktail table, causing tiny
ripples in the drinks of two commiserating IOC members. ``And this
they put on CNN! A compass!''
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues nod and murmur affirmations. They feel his pain.
``I don't know what this cost?'' the old general says. ``What? Was
I supposed to ask?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, apparently, is yes.
</P>
<P>
   Just months ago -- it must seem a million years to the remaining
105 members of the committee -- there was a certain cache in being
an IOC member. It was a great gig, with first-class world travel
and the fawning attention of the dozen or so cities that at any
given time are in hot pursuit of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   The primary competition for bidding cities had for years been
over who could best provide comfort and cheer to the IOC members.
</P>
<P>
   Times are changing.
</P>
<P>
   As the three-day conference on drugs in sports ended Thursday,
it was clear that the old days are gone for good. The questions now
for the members is when will the changes end, and at what cost.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph the IOC had expected from the conference was dwarfed
by the Salt Lake City bidding scandal, which placed a near-crushing
weight on the 105-year-old institution all week.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members left Lausanne looking ahead to March, when the full
committee will meet in a special session to address the Salt Lake
City crisis. The meeting is regarded by many here as the IOC's last
best hope for containing the monster before it does lasting damage
to the Olympic Games themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look to March,'' said IOC member Alex Gilady of Israel.
``We look with hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Never has the IOC been subjected to such relentless indignity.
More than 40 members came to Lausanne for the World Congress on
Doping organized to confront the nagging problem of drug use by
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   When the conference was envisioned by the IOC months ago, it was
seen as a platform for the committee to be seen leading the attack
against performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the week became a forum for abuse by governments,
reporters, athletes and sports officials directed at the IOC --
particularly its president, Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the IOC vice president spearheading the anti-drug
campaign as well as the scandal investigation, described the week
drolly as ``scream therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many speakers proclaimed the IOC too tainted to lead the noble
fight. Renn Crichlow, a former world champion kayaker from Canada,
issued stinging remarks during the conference. ``In Canada and
indeed throughout the world, there is a high degree of cynicism, a
high degree of skepticism and a high degree of mistrust in the IOC
as an organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In normal times, such a conference would attract perhaps 100
members of the media, mostly the reporters who routinely cover the
IOC for readers, listeners and viewers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But with the smell of blood in the air because of the Salt Lake
scandal, the media ranks swelled to nearly 400. They were hostile,
pushy and consistent in their demands for Samaranch to resign -- a
poisoned atmosphere that rendered the IOC members and staff members
puzzled and frightened.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Samaranch's political powers seem diminished.
Certainly, his ability to exert his will over the IOC is at a low
point in his 18-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   In a mini-revolt of sorts, about 40 members made it clear during
a Wednesday breakfast organized to air their grievances that they
will not follow Samaranch's reform edict to surrender their only
meaningful function -- the vote for Olympic host cities.
</P>
<P>
   While no IOC members have publicly joined in the chorus
demanding Samaranch's head, the talk in the Lausanne Palace bar has
at times turned to the topic of ``What if?''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the members have greater dread of losing
Samaranch than they have for the blistering to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Samaranch can lead us out of this tunnel,'' said Italian
IOC member Mario Pescante, perhaps the most outspoken opponent of
Samaranch's campaign to strip the IOC members of their votes to end
the scandal-tainted bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members say they fear the 78-year-old president's departure
would lead to chaos. Five senior members have declared their
interest in succeeding Samaranch after his term ends in 2001, and
if he goes now, the committee could splinter at its most perilous
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more importantly, the members still regard Samaranch
with great respect and feel a deep personal loyalty to him. It is
important to remember that Samaranch handpicked about 80 of the 105
members, making a vote against him for many a personal betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all united together,'' said Prince Alexander de Merode
of Belgium. ``I am sure that Samaranch will consult with the
members and their wish is that he will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the great hope is the special session in March. If the
IOC can expel the five members implicated in the Salt Lake City
scandal, and if meaningful reforms can be adopted in the bidding
process, then members say they hope that the storm will begin to
subside.
</P>
<P>
   They also are convinced that the bright spectacle of the 2000
Games in Sydney will provide the impetus needed to close the book
on this dark chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they acknowledge that a tough road lies ahead. It will take
a two-thirds majority to expel, and some of the targeted members,
notably Jean Claude Ganga of Congo, have vowed to stage a fight to
preserve their memberships.
</P>
<P>
   While IOC marketing officials say fresh consumer polls indicate
that the image of the Games themselves have not yet been damaged by
the scandal, the longer this great public drama persists, the
greater the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if this went on indefinitely it would do some
damage,'' said IOC marketing director Michael Payne. ``That's why
the IOC said it would act quickly and decisively to clean its
house.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if the March session is a success, the IOC's hopes
could be dashed if more revelations of wrongdoing surface,
particularly with the release of the investigation report by the
Salt Lake organizing committee as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Already, members' first-class trips to the six cities bidding
for the 2006 Winter Games have been taken away in the reform push.
It is a near certainty that the days of wining and dining their
ways around the globe are gone, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good run,'' says Gilady, as he stubs out a
half-smoked $10 Cuban in the Lausanne Palace bar. ``But I guess it
must end.''

<P>
   Never has the IOC been subjected to such relentless indignity.
More than 40 members came to Lausanne for the World Congress on
Doping organized to confront the nagging problem of drug use by
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   When the conference was envisioned by the IOC months ago, it was
seen as a platform for the committee to be seen leading the attack
against performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the week became a forum for abuse by governments,
reporters, athletes and sports officials directed at the IOC --
particularly its president, Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Pound, the IOC vice president spearheading the anti-drug
campaign as well as the scandal investigation, described the week
drolly as ``scream therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   Many speakers proclaimed the IOC too tainted to lead the noble
fight. Renn Crichlow, a former world champion kayaker from Canada,
issued stinging remarks during the conference. ``In Canada and
indeed throughout the world, there is a high degree of cynicism, a
high degree of skepticism and a high degree of mistrust in the IOC
as an organization,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In normal times, such a conference would attract perhaps 100
members of the media, mostly the reporters who routinely cover the
IOC for readers, listeners and viewers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But with the smell of blood in the air because of the Salt Lake
scandal, the media ranks swelled to nearly 400. They were hostile,
pushy and consistent in their demands for Samaranch to resign -- a
poisoned atmosphere that rendered the IOC members and staff members
puzzled and frightened.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Samaranch's political powers seem diminished.
Certainly, his ability to exert his will over the IOC is at a low
point in his 18-year reign.
</P>
<P>
   In a mini-revolt of sorts, about 40 members made it clear during
a Wednesday breakfast organized to air their grievances that they
will not follow Samaranch's reform edict to surrender their only
meaningful function -- the vote for Olympic host cities.
</P>
<P>
   While no IOC members have publicly joined in the chorus
demanding Samaranch's head, the talk in the Lausanne Palace bar has
at times turned to the topic of ``What if?''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the members have greater dread of losing
Samaranch than they have for the blistering to continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Samaranch can lead us out of this tunnel,'' said Italian
IOC member Mario Pescante, perhaps the most outspoken opponent of
Samaranch's campaign to strip the IOC members of their votes to end
the scandal-tainted bidding process.
</P>
<P>
   IOC members say they fear the 78-year-old president's departure
would lead to chaos. Five senior members have declared their
interest in succeeding Samaranch after his term ends in 2001, and
if he goes now, the committee could splinter at its most perilous
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more importantly, the members still regard Samaranch
with great respect and feel a deep personal loyalty to him. It is
important to remember that Samaranch handpicked about 80 of the 105
members, making a vote against him for many a personal betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all united together,'' said Prince Alexander de Merode
of Belgium. ``I am sure that Samaranch will consult with the
members and their wish is that he will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, the great hope is the special session in March. If the
IOC can expel the five members implicated in the Salt Lake City
scandal, and if meaningful reforms can be adopted in the bidding
process, then members say they hope that the storm will begin to
subside.
</P>
<P>
   They also are convinced that the bright spectacle of the 2000
Games in Sydney will provide the impetus needed to close the book
on this dark chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, they acknowledge that a tough road lies ahead. It will take
a two-thirds majority to expel, and some of the targeted members,
notably Jean Claude Ganga of Congo, have vowed to stage a fight to
preserve their memberships.
</P>
<P>
   While IOC marketing officials say fresh consumer polls indicate
that the image of the Games themselves have not yet been damaged by
the scandal, the longer this great public drama persists, the
greater the risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if this went on indefinitely it would do some
damage,'' said IOC marketing director Michael Payne. ``That's why
the IOC said it would act quickly and decisively to clean its
house.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if the March session is a success, the IOC's hopes
could be dashed if more revelations of wrongdoing surface,
particularly with the release of the investigation report by the
Salt Lake organizing committee as early as next week.
</P>
<P>
   Already, members' first-class trips to the six cities bidding
for the 2006 Winter Games have been taken away in the reform push.
It is a near certainty that the days of wining and dining their
ways around the globe are gone, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good run,'' says Gilady, as he stubs out a
half-smoked $10 Cuban in the Lausanne Palace bar. ``But I guess it
must end.''

`DRY CLEANING': LOOK OUT FOR A DRY CLEANER AFTER SHE SHEDS HER
STARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
(af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   La Nuit des Temps, a mildly racy nightclub in the center of the
sleepy French town of Belfort, is the equivalent of Pandora's box
in Anne Fontaine's haunting erotic fable ``Dry Cleaning.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is where Jean-Marie Kunstler (Charles Berling) and his
wife, Nicole (Miou-Miou), a proper, buttoned-up French couple who
have been married for 15 years, find themselves one evening
watching a slithery gold-lame-clad brother-sister drag act called
the Queens of the Night lip-synch to Sylvie Vartan records.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Marie and Nicole run a dry-cleaning establishment; what
better metaphor for the starchy petit bourgeois life? And when Loic
(Stanislas Merhar), the male member of the duo, shows up at their
laundry one day to have his gown cleaned, a casual friendship is
struck up that leads the Kunstlers back to the club, where they
dance and flirt shyly with Loic and his sister, Marylin (Mathile
Seigner).
</P>
<P>
   One thing leads to another, and the two couples adjourn to the
apartment above the Kunstlers' shop where Loic and his sister offer
to have sex with them for money. Although Nicole is eager to play,
Jean-Marie gets cold feet and abruptly calls off the swinging
session.
</P>
<P>
   But some deep inner longing has been stirred in both Jean-Marie
and Nicole. And they decide to take their vacation in Basel,
Switzerland, where they know the Queens of the Night will be
performing. There they reaquaint themselves with Loic and Marylin.
</P>
<P>
   And when the brother and sister have an abrupt falling out, and
Marylin runs off to Ibiza with a man on a motorcycle, the Kunstlers
offer to help Loic pick up the pieces. The young man, who says he
is tired of performing anyway, accepts a job in Jean-Marie's
laundry and soon moves in with the Kunstlers, whose household
already includes a young son and Nicole's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Loic, who exudes a cunning, androgynous sexuality, makes no
bones about his lust for both the Kunstlers. Nicole turns out to be
easy prey, but Jean-Marie proves a far more elusive conquest for
Loic, who insists that despite having hustled his body, he has
never felt this way before about another man.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Dry Cleaning'' has a veneer of realism, the film, which
accumulates an explosive psychological tension, has the structure
and the implacable momentum of a stern moral fable. On the surface
the movie, which opens today in Manhattan, may appear to be a
titillating story about the ``liberation'' of two repressed
swingers.
</P>
<P>
   But underneath, this essentially conservative film is a
disturbing meditation on the power of unleashed sexuality to take
over people's lives and dissolve conventional social boundaries and
taboos with the force of a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Loic, who was brought up in an orphanage, is a kind of erotic
wild child. While part of him longs for the stability and surrogate
parenting the Kunstlers provide, another part is an arrogant,
power-hungry little boy who recklessly wields his potent sexuality
without regard for the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Merhar's sinister, spellbinding performance invests Loic with a
feline stealth and sensuality that recall the young Rudolf Nureyev.
From behind partially hooded eyes, he is always watching and
calculating when to pounce. At the same time, it is never clear
what Loic really has in mind beyond the immediate gratification of
conquest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dry Cleaning'' presents the Kunstlers as a representative
strait-laced couple whose impulse to dabble in dangerous erotic
games lands them in deep trouble. Loic and his ``sister'' (it's
left unclear what their biological relationship really is, but we
get a strong sense that they have been casual lovers since their
days together in an orphanage) grew up without any normal sense of
boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   To people like the Kunstlers, who seem to embody the Gallic
equivalent of family values, the brother and sister are temptation
incarnate.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which is flawed by a clunky melodramatic ending,
reminds you of the power and universality of the erotic
imagination. Just because some people don't radiate overt sexuality
doesn't mean that somewhere in the back of their minds they can't
imagine themselves wantonly kicking over the traces and
surrendering to passion. A glimpse of the possibility is there
inside all of us. &QL;

<P>
   For retransmission of these stories, call 888-346-9867.
</P>
<P>
   COXNET-WHEELS-COX (Undated) _ A reminder really shouldn't be
necessary, but all the attention and praise being given the new
Beetle seem to warrant one: Volkswagen is still importing, and
quite frequently selling, the Jetta sedan. Fact is, the Jetta is
the best-selling Volkswagen in North America with 1998 sales
totaling about 90,000, prompting VW execs to call the Mexican-built
car the leader here among German sedans and the only six-cylinder
European car available for under $20,000. By Russ DeVault.
</P>
<P>
   THE MECHANIC-COX (Undated) _ Misdiagnosis of electrical repairs
not only contributes to the animosity between the consumer and the
auto repair industry but also costs millions of hours and dollars
each year in lost revenue. By Nora Carter.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-AZR (Phoenix) Chevrolet Lumina is headed toward the
end of its road, destined to be replaced for 2000 as Chevy's
bread-and-butter family sedan by a more interesting craft bearing
an old name, Impala. The Lumina's styling is attractive, though
generic. Performance is competent, though bland. The overall theme
is mainstream to a fault, offending no one but not enticing anyone,
either. The big plus during its 10 years of existence has been its
affordability. By Bob Golfen.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-REVIEW-BOS (Undated) _ Two-door automobiles, for the most
part, leave me cold. What's the point of having two rows of seats
and one set of doors? I'm not talking about sports cars with back
seats designed for tax collectors (more properly, perhaps, to avoid
them), or wee convertibles with rudimentary melon carriers in the
rear. I refer to real cars, bread-and-butter cars that working
stiffs and families own. By John R. White.
</P>
<P>
   CARS-WILLIAMS-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ There's a brand-new Honda
on the market, ready to battle for dominancy in yet another market
segment: the minivan. By G. Chambers Williams III.
</P>
<P>
   AUTO-COLUMN-BOS (Undated) _ From time to time, you may have
heard rumblings about OEM vs. aftermarket crash parts _ you
probably wondered what they were rumbling about. OEM stands for
original equipment manufacturer and means a part made for your car
by the company that made your car or made the parts for the company
that assembled your car. Aftermarket means everybody else who makes
pieces for your automobile. Consumer groups from time to time mount
campaigns to focus public attention on the need for OEM parts. By
John R. White.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-WINDSTAR-MOMS-NYT (Undated) _ While serving as vehicle
line director, supervising the development of the 1999 Ford
Windstar, Mary Ellen Heyde was struck by the unusually large number
of women with young children who were working on the redesign. She
thought it made sense to tap the maternal expertise of these 30
``Windstar Moms,'' most of them engineers, and she consulted them
routinely as the design progressed. With the aim of making the
minivan more family-friendly, the mothers offered suggestions for
innovations and improvements. By Julie Edelson Halpert.

`SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE': WHEN ROMANCE HEATS UP, DOUBTS GO ON BACK
BURNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Productin notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In movies as in the kitchen, good intentions simply aren't
enough.
</P>
<P>
   The director or cook can toss in all the traditional
ingredients, but if the talent and magic aren't there, the souffle
sags.
</P>
<P>
   So it is with ``Simply Irresistible,'' which takes Sarah
Michelle Gellar of television's ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and
drops her into an even more harrowing situation: chef in the
Southern Cross, the failing 70-year-old TriBeCa restaurant she has
inherited from her mother.
</P>
<P>
   What Judith Roberts as writer and Mark Tarlov as debutant
director apparently have in mind here is a throwback to the
romantic comedies of the 1930s and 40s, when suave, handsome men
with playboy social lives fell head over heels in love, much to
their surprise, with some poor working girl who never believed she
could enchant such a prince.
</P>
<P>
   That is basically the plot of ``Simply Irresistible,'' which
even tosses in Christopher Durang as Gene O'Reilly, the mysterious
Cupid who enables Ms. Gellar as Amanda Shelton to meet Sean Patrick
Flanery as Tom Barlett in a Manhattan Greenmarket, thanks to an
elusive crab.
</P>
<P>
   The supericilous Barlett is a Henri Bendel executive in charge
of building and opening the Fifth Avenue store's lavish new
restaurant, Jonathan's, named for his boss and aspiring to four
stars with the aid of a temperamental French chef.
</P>
<P>
   Cupid, as a taxi driver, will see to it that Bartlett, whose
dates never survive beyond three outings, is eventually diverted to
the Southern Cross, where Amanda, facing the demise of her
restaurant, will suddenly blossom into a chef whose food is capable
of reducing diners to tears of joy and heights of ecstasy, sexual
and otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as romance between Amanda and Tom heats up and
curdles (only temporarily), a crisis will develop in the restaurant
just before opening night, when the critics will be turning out to
render judgment.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of the shortcomings of this genial, well-meaning
but ultimately unenchanting film that scene after scene is stolen
by the second bananas: Larry Gilliard Jr. as Nolan Traynor,
Amanda's wise, upbeat, funny sous-chef, and Patricia Clarkson as
Lois McNally, Bartlett's clear-sighted aide, who has her cap set
for the big boss, Jonathan Bendel (Dylan Baker).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gellar is appealing as the self-doubting Amanda; Flanery,
who used to portray the young Indiana Jones, sometimes resembles
the young Laurence Harvey without the unwaveringly confident
ophidian charm, and the food looks luscious.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Simply Irresistible,'' for all its fantasy and magic,
isn't magical. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply Irresistible'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly
cautioned). It involves some sexual situations, profanity and
familiar epithets. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SIMPLY IRRESISTIBLE
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Mark Tarlov; written by Judith Roberts; director of
photography, Robert Stevens; edited by Paul Karasick; music by Gil
Goldstein; produced by John Fiedler, Jon Amiel and Joe Caracciolo,
Jr.; released by 20th Century Fox. Running time: 100 minutes. This
film is rated PG-13. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WITH: Sarah Michelle Gellar (Amanda Shelton), Sean Patrick
Flanery (Tom Bartlett), Patricia Clarkson (Lois McNally), Dylan
Baker (Jonathan Bendel), Christopher Durang (Gene O'Reilly) and

`HANDS ON A HARD BODY': TRUCK LUST AS A SOURCE OF ENDURANCE IN
TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Prduction notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By ANITA GATES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Benny is a little scary when he gets excited. ``It's like the
first time you kill a really big animal,'' he says in his best
Texas good-old-boy voice. ``Exhilarating!''
</P>
<P>
   The experience Benny is comparing to his hunting triumphs is
having won a pickup truck in 1992 by being the contestant who
lasted longest just standing there with at least one hand on the
truck.
</P>
<P>
   In S.R. Bindler's observant, surprisingly fascinating
documentary ``Hands on a Hard Body,'' Benny is back for the 1995
contest at a Nissan dealership in Longview, Texas, hoping to win
again. He is joined by two dozen or so other contestants with
various styles and motivations.
</P>
<P>
   One participant, Norma, is so overweight that her ability to
last an afternoon, much less the 80 to 100 hours the contest is
expected to last, is questionable, but she claims divine right of a
sort. ``My husband and I have been praying for a truck,'' she
explains. ``I believe that this is what God wants us to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Janis, who is missing a few front teeth, is planning to do it
through sheer determination. ``I finish everything I start,'' she
says. (Apparently this does not apply to her dental work.) Her
husband agrees that she's going to win but as long as he has a
movie camera on him he wants to brag about his ``20-ton
air-conditioner,'' which ``will bring it down to 12 below zero'' in
his living room.
</P>
<P>
   Greg thinks he'll win because he's just out of the Marine Corps;
even Benny agrees that an ex-Marine would have the right mind-set.
J.D., the oldest contestant, has promised his wife he'll win the
truck for her. One of the judges predicts that Kelli will win
because she is preparing and eating properly (unlike another
contestant who was seen eating a hamburger, which would take lots
of energy to digest).
</P>
<P>
   The camera starts rolling at Day 1, hour 1 and stays until the
end, filming the contestants through their 5-minute hourly breaks
and 15-minute breaks every 6 hours, through the period when people
are breaking into fatigue-induced laughter and one contestant,
defeated after 68 hours, walks away, dazed and barefoot.
</P>
<P>
   These may not be people whom moviegoers think they want to spend
time with, but this is accomplished documentary making, finding
universal lessons in determination, struggle, planning, persistence
and the relationship of mind and body. The experience turns out to
be simultaneously primal and complex. Or as Benny sums it up,
``It's a human drama thing.''
</P>
<P>
   To Bindler's credit, he does not look down on his subjects, an
understandable temptation for a hometown boy who went away to NYU
film school. (Recent documentaries like ``Unmade Beds,'' a look at
four chronically single New Yorkers, have shown far less sympathy.)
</P>
<P>
   Bindler observes their quirks _ and can't completely hide that
he thinks it's strange for the local church to have a ``prayer
chain'' to help Norma win the pickup _ but he looks for each
person's humanity and finds it.
</P>
<P>
   When Sydney Pollack made ``They Shoot Horses, Don't They?'' in
1969, the desperation of its dance-marathon contestants was

WWII HERO WALLENBERG MAY GET THAT SPOTLIGHT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   family fortune, a great education, a secure and unlimited
future. In 1944, he risked everything to save Hungarian Jews from
Nazi extermination.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks as one of the greatest _ and least known _ heroes of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A Swedish businessman and diplomat, he volunteered to go to
Budapest, Hungary, where the Nazis were moving to wipe out the last
large European community of Jews. His relentless, courageous
efforts prevented Adolf Eichmann from deporting tens of thousands _
estimates reach as high as 100,000 _ to the death camps.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Raoul Wallenberg. Or should I say ``is'' Raoul
Wallenberg?
</P>
<P>
   During his months in Budapest, he lived in constant danger.
Eichmann called him ``Jewdog Wallenberg'' and ordered his murder.
He survived partly because he slept in a different place every
night.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, his humanitarian efforts were ignored by the
Soviets who thought he was a spy and took him prisoner. While the
Russians said he died many years ago in detention, some people
believe he could still be alive. They include Morris Wolff of
Phoenix, who has spent 15 years researching the life and
disappearance of this extraordinary man.
</P>
<P>
   A Yale law graduate and ex-professor, Wolff moved here a year
ago and worked briefly for the Arizona Corporation Commission. He's
now finishing a book on Wallenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff taught human rights law and was practicing in Philadelphia
when he was asked by Wallenberg's family in Sweden if he could help
them. He filed a federal lawsuit in 1984, alleging the Soviet Union
had violated international law.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., found the Soviets
liable for violating Wallenberg's human rights, imposed a fine of
$39 million and ordered them to produce him. The ruling was
appealed, however, and set aside for lack of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The official Soviet line is that he died of a heart attack in a
Moscow prison in 1947. Others speculate that Josef Stalin had
ordered his execution. But freed Soviet prisoners reported
Wallenberg had been seen into the 1980s, and no credible evidence
of his death has been provided.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1981 book ``Righteous Gentile _'' Wallenberg was a Lutheran
_ John Bierman concluded that he might still be living. He cited
the Soviet tradition of keeping well-known people, from Feodor
Dostoyevsky to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in confinement for long
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, whose research draws on both American and Soviet
intelligence reports, is optimistic that Wallenberg survives.
Conversations with two Russian Orthodox priests in 1993 strengthen
his belief. He's hopeful that his book will ``ignite a clamor and
lead the United States to demand an honest accounting of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   America's efforts on behalf of Wallenberg have been shamefully
slight, especially in light of his U.S. ties. He was an honor
student at the University of Michigan and went to Budapest at the
request of the American War Refugee Board.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War's onset, tense Soviet relations apparently
figured into U.S. apathy. Wallenberg's fate wasn't regarded as
important enough to risk stirring up more diplomatic trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A Free Wallenberg Committee was formed in 1980, and for only the
second time in history, Congress granted him honorary U.S.
citizenship (the first honoree was Winston Churchill). But that
campaign and Swedish efforts produced nothing new from the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to overstate how much Wallenberg gave up in 1944.
Being a Wallenberg in Sweden is akin to being a Rockefeller in this
country, only bigger. Companies under Wallenberg family control
last year accounted for 40 percent of the Swedish stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff said one reason for writing the book is so more Americans
will know of the sacrifices made by ``one of the most selfless
citizens of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope the book will acquaint more people with a prodigious
hero. And wherever he may be, I hope Wallenberg has found peace. He
would be 86 today. &QL;

FANS STILL FLOCK TO SEE `PARTY' GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RANDY CORDOVA  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's the party that never seems to end.
</P>
<P>
   At only 16 years old, Lesley Gore recorded the endearingly
bratty ``It's My Party'' (``And I'll cry if I want to! Cry if I
want to! Cry if I want to!,'' the chorus endlessly whines).
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six years later, the record has the comfortable
familiarity of a nursery rhyme. Part of it has to do with the song
rarely being off the radio; the other part has to do with the tune
forever being featured on TV commercials selling golden oldies
collections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never really died,'' agrees Gore. ``When you look at the
top 20 radio stations in the various cities around the United
States, nine out of 10 of them are oldies stations. That says
something to me about the people that grew up with this music.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is an interesting paradox. She's a mature, sophisticated
New Yorker who is a regular on the Manhattan cabaret scene, but
she's eternally linked with a song written from a teenager's
perspective. But she won't bash the tune that made her the Britney
Spears of her day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something about the purity and honesty of the song just
works,'' she says, in a husky voice that sounds little like the one
that wailed about Judy and Johnny. ``The other thing, frankly, that
gets me through is watching the audience reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Gore never will spoof that tune, or any of her
other hits. She had a bunch of them, which tend to be overshadowed
by the monstrous ``Party.'' There was the daring riot grrrl anthem
``You Don't Own Me'' (later covered by Joan Jett), the bubbly
``Sunshine, Lollipops and Rainbows'' and ``California Nights,'' a
dreamy Beach Boys-flavored gem from 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people really treat these songs as sacred cows,'' she
says. ``I don't treat them as sacred, but I have respect for the
music. I know what it means to the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Her career has taken a lot of surprising turns. She played
Pussycat, Catwoman's slinky assistant, on two episodes of
``Batman.'' She wrote the song ``Out Here on My Own'' for the 1980
film ``Fame,'' and wound up getting an Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But it's her run as a teen queen with an awesome flip hairdo
that earned her a spot in the public's heart. And she wasn't merely
a singing Barbie doll _ Quincy Jones produced most of her hits and
Gore had a hand in writing some of them.
</P>
<P>
   PolyGram and Rhino recently saluted Gore by both issuing CD
retrospectives. Even more impressive is the imaginatively titled
``It's My Party!,'' a five-disc spectacular from Bear Family
Records featuring absolutely everything she recorded between 1963
</P>
<P>
   and 1969 (``an incredible honor,'' Gore says).
</P>
<P>
   On the East Coast, she performs solo gigs in nightclubs.
Elsewhere, it's oldies shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always asking me when I'm going to stop doing it,''
she says. ``The answer is probably never. And to be honest, it
doesn't make me feel badly. It certainly was a statement back then
that meant something to a lot of people. That's something good,
something to be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   It is her party, after all. &QL;

PARROT MAN MUST SOON LEAVE HIS FLOCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MACKENZIE WARREN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mark Bittner, caretaker of the 50 curious wild
parrots who frequent Telegraph Hill, is being forced to flee the
coup.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described ``friend of the flock'' said Wednesday that
the 120-year-old home he has been living in is scheduled for a
major renovation, since it has no foundation, and the property
owner has asked him to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Those who know his work say Bittner is more than a friend. They
say he has devoted the past five years to studying and spoiling the
flock of brightly colored South American conures that have
mysteriously made their way to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's this guy, a modern-day Haight-Ashbury version of St.
Francis,'' said Judy Irving, a filmmaker who's making a documentary
about Bittner and his birds. ``It's magical, the relationship he's
established with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In June, however, Bittner will have to move when the renovation
begins. Bittner said that was OK. He sees it as a sign he must
leave the birds and move on.
</P>
<P>
   People who have strolled up the hundred or so steps on the east
side of Telegraph Hill and past Bittner's home, Irving said, often
have wondered aloud which is stranger: 50 tropical birds in an
urban setting 4,000 miles from their natural habitat, or someone
crazy enough to devote five years of his life to watch over them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not doing this out of any kind of eccentricity,'' Bittner
said. ``It's more out of curiosity and love.''
</P>
<P>
   In October 1993, he started to notice the bright green parrots
with various-colored heads while he was putting seed out for other
birds in the neighborhood. He tossed some to the parrots for about
a few months, but after a while a neighbor asked him to stop. The
birds were making too much noise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day, I had said this would be the last day I fed them,''
Bittner said. ``And when that guy complained, I decided that was
it. I'd just go and scare them off for good.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bittner said, the parrots weren't impressed when he
stepped out to scream at them. They had taken a liking to him, and
they intended to stay.
</P>
<P>
   So he began looking around for experts to advise him on caring
for the conures, though he did not have much success.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I looked around for a while and researched on my own,''
Bittner said, ``I became the person I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Bittner believes the Telegraph Hill birds were imported from
Ecuador and northern Peru before quarantine restrictions were
tightened in 1992. But the birds are rare: The Convention on
International Trade in Endangered Species has classified them as a
``near-threatened'' species.
</P>
<P>
   The flock includes descendants of cherry-headed conures, a
blue-crowned conure, a mitred conure and some cherry-headed-mitred
hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Bittner has seen more than 40 parrots born since he became
committed to them nearly five years ago, bringing the total number
that have flown with the flock to about 100. He keeps a daily log
and detailed file on each bird, and has gotten to know each one
personally. All have names and their own personalities, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For a few more months, life will be normal for the likes of
Mingas, Connor, Scrapperella, Picasso, Olive, Pushkin and the
others, and for Bittner, too.
</P>
<P>
   But then Bittner, who spends about $100 a month to feed the
birds, will start the solemn process of distancing himself from his
pals. That way, when his early June move comes around, the
separation won't be so harsh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'll feel sad,'' Bittner said as he gazed at Mingas.
``But the time will be right. It will be time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Bittner said he was not upset about moving. He said the property
owner had been gracious and generous. And the time is simply right
for him to go. ``It's time to end it,'' he said. ``Losing this
place is that natural ending.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the parrots? ``They'll be just fine,'' he said. Bittner
said he had made sure they did not depend on him for food. Despite
what he spends monthly on bird feed, he considers what he gives
them little more than dessert.

MAN'S BEST FRIEND, AND PERHAPS ALSO THE ARTIST'S

   NEW YORK _ Tails (and tongues) will be wagging when the 123rd
annual Westminster Kennel Club Show opens Monday in Manhattan. Dog
owners from across the country will congregate to parade prized
pets and, perhaps, trade doggerel. (Notice to out-of-town pug
lovers: New York pug owners converge on Pug Hill in Central Park,
near the East 72nd Street entrance, every Saturday morning.)
</P>
<P>
   To take advantage of this, William Doyle Galleries, in
conjunction with Bonhams of London, is conducting an auction called
``Dogs and Cats in Art'' on Tuesday, at Doyle's at 175 E. 87th St.
in Manhattan. The 166 lots include 19th- and 20th-century paintings
by the English animal portraitists John Emms, George Earl, Arthur
Wardle and Richard Ansdell, as well as bronzes and ephemera. There
are toys for grown-ups, like a sturdy papier-mache bulldog with a
bristle ruff from France, circa 1900, that barks out loud with an
articulated jaw when his leash is yanked (estimate: $700 to $900).
</P>
<P>
   And there are some unusual dog accessories. One black and gilded
Georgian-style traveling animal case, for example, is done up in
chinoiserie, with a gilded pagoda-shaped roof, bracket feet, an oak
parquet floor and glass windowpanes on the sides. A pink curtain
drops down the rear of the interior to serve as a backdrop for the
animal inside. The glass box, about 22 inches tall, neatly
disassembles to fit into a travel case (estimate: $5,000 to
$7,000).
</P>
<P>
   The next week, Sotheby's is selling 120 ink drawings of animals,
including several dogs, by Alexander Calder in its Feb. 16 Arcade
auction, ``Impressionist, Modern and Contemporary Art.'' So there's
something for every dog lover around.
</P>
<P>
   The dog has been immortalized in ink and stone since ancient
times. The old cemetery in Athens is full of classical marble grave
steles, circa 500 B.C., with the faithful dog, the widow and the
children carved in bas-relief, mourning their loss. Artists have
also celebrated dogs' unconditional love in jade, porcelain,
needlework, even painted miniatures.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the Duc de Berry promenading through the Loire
countryside on horseback, his two dogs galloping alongside his
horse, in the illustrated manuscript for August in ``Les Tres
Riches Heures du Duc de Berry,'' circa 1415.
</P>
<P>
   Many early depictions of dogs are in hunting scenes. Who can
forget the snarling hound Rubens painted in his bloodthirsty
``Crocodile Hunt''? In this royal hunt scene, circa 1615, the
pitiless dog plays the leading role in his master's effort to bring
down a roaringly mad hippo.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last few centuries have dogs taken on a kinder look.
It was probably Queen Victoria's interest in breeding dogs that led
to the popularity of dog portraiture in the 1800s, an appeal that
continues today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Victorians held their dogs very close to their hearts,''
said David Mason, director of the MacDonnal-Mason Gallery, a London
firm exhibiting in Florida at the Palm Beach International Art and
Antique Fair, which runs through Sunday. ``It was the first time
dogs were treated like humans, as part of the family. Dog portraits
became an important oeuvre.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Edwin Henry Landseer was one of the most popular and
accomplished dog painters of the era, Mason said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Landseer was the Stubbs of the 19th century,'' he said,
referring to George Stubbs, the 18th-century English painter of
zebras, lions and Arabian horses whose paintings fetch millions of
dollars. ``Like Stubbs, Landseer was a perfectionist who studied
and dissected animals so he could paint them more perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no Landseers in the Doyle sale, but there is an oil by
Richard Ansdell, a Landseer follower from Liverpool. The painting,
``The Good Shepherd'' of 1870, depicts a Scot in a kilt, complete
with sporran and tartan throw, out on the moors holding a lamb he
has rescued. By his side, the poor lamb's mother and a proud border
collie look on. It is saccharine but well painted (estimate:
$50,000 to $70,000).
</P>
<P>
   The Austrians were as besotted with their dogs as the English
were in the 19th century. Janssens van der Maelen, a Brussels
gallery exhibiting at the Palm Beach fair, has a pair of Austrian
terra-cotta Dobermans, circa 1860, that are life-size, beautifully
modeled and full of personality. They were made as garden ornaments
but are elegant enough for any marble foyer. The pair costs
$48,000. These dogs don't come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   In France, bronze dogs were particularly popular in the 19th
century. Robert Bowman, a Palm Beach exhibitor from London, is
selling a sculpture of two playful whippets in cast bronze by
Pierre Jules Mene (1810-79).
</P>
<P>
   ``Mene was a member of the Animaliers, a French group dedicated
to the depiction of animals,'' Bowman said. ``The school was
founded by Antoine-Louis Barye, a top sculptor, and they worked in
and around Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Bronzes were not made in signed editions at that time, Bowman
said, adding, ``Clients would see an example of a dog at a salon
and order a copy for themselves.'' The trick today, he said, is to
find an early casting, when the chiseling is crisp and fresh. ``You
want to be able to see the pads on the paws, the teeth, the tongue,
the fur,'' he said. ``The work should be almost photographic in its
modeling.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Russian Imperial Court, no material was too good for
figures of dogs. Wartski of London is selling a palm-size Faberge
bulldog in its booth at the Palm Beach fair. It is carved in
bowenite, a translucent, pale green serpentine stone that looks
like jade. The dog has eyes of green demantoid garnets, a
semiprecious stone; a gold collar, and a gold medallion that reads
``First Prize'' in Cyrillic script.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faberge made a lot of dogs, but I've seen only two bulldogs in
my entire life,'' said Katherine Purcell, a director of Wartski.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan gallery A La Vieille Russie, also exhibiting in
Palm Beach, has a circa-1870 dog's head carved in crystal that
Faberge mounted in about 1903, so it could be placed on a
mantelpiece or a table.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of carving is called reverse crystal, because it's
carved from the inside,'' said Peter Schaffer, a vice president of
the gallery. ``It's just an accident that it was put under a glass
dome and mounted in gold by Faberge.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no idea who might buy it. ``Reverse-crystal collectors
are not necessarily looking for Faberge and vice versa,'' he said.
The price is $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 21, Christie's New York sold a pair of porcelain dogs,
circa 1765, in its sale of English decorative arts. Named the
Talbot-Shrewsbury Hounds because they had been owned by Baron
Talbot and the Earl of Shrewsbury, they went for $497,500, a record
price for Chinese export porcelain sold in the United States. The
high estimate was $380,000. It seems every dog has his day.

UNLIKE MAMBO KINGS, AN EMPRESS TIDIES UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes at end of review)  
(DW) 
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like so many of Oscar Hijuelos' earlier novels, ``Empress of the
Splendid Season'' is a chronicle of familial love that unfurls in
New York over the last five decades. It is another tale of a Cuban
family, torn between fading memories of life back home in Cuba and
the glittering promises of the American Dream, between the
centripetal powers of kinship and tradition and the centrifugal
forces of history and generational change.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas Hijuelos' two best known novels, ``The Mambo Kings Play
Songs of Love'' (1989) and ``The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez
O'Brien'' (1993), worked these themes on a colorful, epic canvas,
``Empress'' is a smaller, more modest book. It is less fecund in
its peopling of a fictional world, less ambitious in its
orchestration of overlapping stories. Even its language tends to be
less expansive, less exuberant than its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hijuelos is such a fluent writer, because he writes with
such affection for his characters, the novel is not without its
rewards, but it remains, in contrast to his earlier books, an oddly
attenuated piece of fiction, lacking both the energy of ``Mambo
Kings'' and ``Sisters'' and the fierce narrative control of ``
Ives' Christmas'' (1995). In fact it often feels like a tired
reworking of old material, a musty, paint-by-numbers version of
Hijuelos' favorite preoccupations and motifs, brightened with a few
splashes of inspiration,
</P>
<P>
   The title character of ``Empress'' is Lydia Espana, a Cuban
emigre who has been a cleaning woman since her husband, Raul, a
waiter, began having heart problems. Lydia, who carries herself
``with the imperious attitude of a young movie starlet,'' strikes
many of her acquaintances as snobbish, self-pitying and
pretentious. She likes to think she has more in common with the
cultivated people she works for than with many of her neighbors,
and she imposes a strict code of behavior and dress on her
children.
</P>
<P>
   In quick, summary fashion, Hijuelos sketches in Lydia's history
and the events that transformed her from ``the Empress of the
Splendid Season'' into ``Lydia the Spanish cleaning lady.''
</P>
<P>
   Lydia, we're told, was the spoiled daughter of a well-to-do
Cuban businessman who kicked her out of the house when he found out
about her affair with a middle-aged man. She left Cuba for New York
in 1947 and soon found her movie-fueled dreams of America _ ``where
life was all pearl necklaces, fancy mansions, speak-easies,
gangsters, cowboys and unbelievably glamorous women or drop-dead
handsome men'' _ dissolving in the fetid gloom of a sweatshop where
she worked as an apprentice seamstress.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning rich people's apartments is something of an
improvement, but it's still a demeaning job, and it's portrayed by
Hijuelos in flat, generic terms that substitute clumsy symbolism
for the mythic resonance of his earlier books.
</P>
<P>
   Hijuelos makes broad generalizations about cleaning women
daydreaming about ``winning new washing machines on the `Queen for
a Day' television show,'' and wearing tennis shoes and ``thick
nylons with runs in them.'' He writes about the hardships endured
by cleaning women with children _ women ``who dragged themselves
out of bed early in the mornings and, leaving the kids with a
neighbor, if they could, worked six days a week and still could
never earn enough to make ends meet.''
</P>
<P>
   He tries to flesh out Lydia's experience with little vignettes
about other cleaning women she knows: one who won the lottery and
moved from the Bronx to Astoria, Queens; another who scrimped and
saved with her husband to buy a bungalow in the Catskills, only to
die of cancer shortly after retiring from her job.
</P>
<P>
   None of these walk-on characters develops into a memorable human
being, and the same might be said of Lydia's employers, a motley
assortment of rich people and eccentrics whose lives Lydia
vicariously enjoys. Even Osprey, her favorite employer, who helps
her son, Rico, remains a strangely fuzzy collection of class
stereotypes: a wealthy, aristocratic lawyer who knew President
Eisenhower, who liked to travel abroad and who treated his staff
with paternalistic affection.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the novel, the contrast drawn between Osprey's life
and Lydia's feels mechanical and pat. His world is filled with
``glamour and money, cleanliness and good manners,'' while hers is
defined by what she will never do: ``Never buy a piece of property.
Never own a firsthand car. Never sit by a late 19th-century French
writing desk at the Armory Show, scribbling out checks without a
single doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   A similar predictability attends Hijuelos' depiction of the
generational disputes within the Espana family: just as a sexually
precocious Lydia rebelled against her strict father, so her
liberated daughter Alicia rebels against her; and just as Lydia
grew estranged from her family, so her children drift away from
her. This sort of schematic rendering of the schisms in the Espana
clan stands in sharp contrast to the highly nuanced dissection of
the familial bonds of love, resentment and regret found in the
author's earlier novels, and it's qualified only by Hijuelos'
sympathetic rendering of the difficulties Rico has leaving the
world of his parents behind.
</P>
<P>
   Propelled by his mother's expectations, Rico works hard in
school, goes to college and grad school and becomes a highly paid
psychotherapist, ministering to well-heeled yuppies. In achieving
success, however, Rico has misplaced his sense of self. There is a
chilliness to his dealings with his parents now, and he eventually
realizes that he belongs nowhere, neither to his mother's world in
Harlem nor to Osprey's world on Park Avenue. He has become an
emotional exile, disconnected from both his past and his present.
</P>
<P>
   Rico's story, detailed in the final chapters of ``Empress,''
closes the novel on a persuasive note but does not make up for the
perfunctory tone of much of his mother's saga. From another writer,
``Empress'' might read like a promising work of fiction, filled
with hints of better things to come. From the richly talented
Hijuelos, who has spoiled his readers until now, it comes as a
disappointment.

<P>
   GOSPEL-GRAMMYS-HNS (San Francisco) _ The road to gospel
Grammydom can be curious indeed. Consider Deniece Williams' career
over more than two decades. For all her rock 'n' roll hits _ solo
and with Johnny Mathis _ Williams had been a Grammy bridesmaid 10
times, but never a bride. A few years ago, she took a gamble and
crossed over to gospel. The result: three Grammy nominations and
three wins. Now she's after her fourth. By Corrie M. Anders.
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLIC-RITUALS-REVIEW-NYT (Undated) _ Although resisting major
change, the Catholic Church has been enacting lesser changes in
ritual and practice designed to render ancient religious customs
compatible with the spirit of the times. In much of this, experts
say, the Vatican struggles to take into account the sensibilities
and convictions of a widely varying membership in broadly differing
societies. A recent statement on exorcism is an example. By John
Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   POLITICS-CHRIST-COX (Longview, Texas) _ Though Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. was able to maintain his nonviolent commitment to a
righteous cause some 30 years ago, some observers say that
Christians and politics today make for a stormier brew.
</P>
<P>
   JEWS-SABBATH-COX (Undated) _ From a distance, they look like
ordinary utility wires, but three Atlanta area synagogues now have
ritual enclosures that allow traditional Jews to carry items from
their homes to the synagogue on sabbaths and holidays. Strict
sabbath observers may not carry even a key or a package of Kleenex
on the sabbath. But the cord that is strung around the Toco Hill
neighborhood Beth Jacob synagogues makes a two-mile area
symbolically part of the synagogue. We look at why the synagogues
go to the trouble and expense _ about $10,000 a year _ of
maintaining the cords and what impact they have on the community.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-COLUMN-NYT (Undated) _ Over the last 300 years,
religion and economics have come to constitute distinctly different
spheres, talking two conceptually different languages. They may
address each other, as when Pope John Paul II called again in
Mexico City for solidarity with the hemisphere's poor. But
economists, however sympathetic to such appeals, bristle when
morals get mixed up with economic analysis. Theologians turn very
nervous when someone like William James begins to talk about the
``cash value'' of religious beliefs, as if the sacred could be
given a price tag. By Peter Steinfels.
</P>
<P>
   RELIGION-JONES-COLUMN-TEX (Undated) _ Although we in this
country focused our attention on John Paul's visit to St. Louis on
Tuesday and Wednesday, his journey to Mexico was filled with
significance. By Jim Jones.

`THE LAST DAYS': IN HUNGARY, THE FINAL DAYS OF THE `FINAL
SOLUTION' 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Productin notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Moll's documentary film ``The Last Days,'' a concise,
devastating history of the Nazis' decimation of Hungary's Jewish
population during the final days of World War II, offers a ghastly,
inverse kind of reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   It reminds us that yes, there are still images and stories of
human cruelty and degradation that we can never get used to, that
we shouldn't get used to, no matter how intensely the mass media
have flooded us with pictures of human nature at its vilest.
</P>
<P>
   The film's most searing images, shown sparingly near the end of
the movie, include scenes of concentration camp inmates liberated
from Auschwitz by Allied troops. These hollow-eyed, tottering
skeletons, starved almost beyond recognition, seem barely human as
they gaze at the camera through eyes of the living dead.
</P>
<P>
   These pictures are matched in impact by the interwoven
testaments of five Holocaust survivors and especially by one
woman's calm, understated account of her days and nights spent
stuffed in a boxcar on its way to a death camp. (Until the doors
were opened, the passengers believed they were being sent to work
in a vineyard.)
</P>
<P>
   Her description of the train's arrival at Auschwitz is
illustrated with haunting rare photographs taken by a Nazi soldier
of the lining up and dispatching of the new arrivals. Those deemed
unfit for slave labor (children up to the ages of 12 to 14, people
over 50 and the sick) were immediately sent to the gas chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Why another documentary on a subject that has been scrutinized
so deeply that some might assume there's nothing left to say or
show? In focusing on Hungarian Jews, the last major national group
to be funneled into the Nazi death machine, the film forces us to
contemplate the Nazis' implacable genocidal fury.
</P>
<P>
   For by the time German troops invaded Hungary on March 19, 1944,
Hitler knew the war was lost. But that knowledge seems only to have
intensified the Nazi effort to carry out the ``final solution'' as
quickly and efficiently as possible, right up until the Allies
liberated the death camps. In less than three months, some 440,000
Hungarian Jews were rounded up and deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last Days,'' which opens Friday at the Clearview Cinemas,
is the first feature documentary from the Shoah Foundation. Its
executive producer is Steven Spielberg.
</P>
<P>
   If the broad outlines of its story are similar to Claude
Lanzmann's nine-hour epic documentary, ``Shoah,'' its brisk pace
and compact form make it the opposite in some ways of Lanzmann's
exhaustive 1985 masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Running only an hour and a half, ``The Last Days'' has a
beginning, middle and end. Instead of accruing an immense volume of
detailed testimony elicited through a relentless interview process,
the movie is edited with the precision of a Hollywood film and has
a tastefully subdued musical score by Hans Zimmer. Like Spielberg's
``Schindler's List,'' it even has what could be construed as a
``happy'' ending.
</P>
<P>
   The five Holocaust survivors whose reminiscences form the heart
of the movie are a likable, articulate, youthful-looking group
(they're in their late 60s and 70s), and all seem to have made some
measure of peace with the past. Several are shown surrounded by
large, loving families of children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moving from one to the next in a series of portraits,
the movie weaves their stories into a shifting mosaic of voices.
There is Tom Lantos, a United States Representative from California
who is the only Holocaust survivor elected to Congress; Alice Lok
Cahana, an artist who deals with Holocaust themes; Renee Firestone,
a teacher who works with the Simon Wiesenthal Center's Educational
Outreach Program; Bill Basch, a successful Los Angeles businessman,
and Irene Zisblatt, a grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Each person's story is so compelling it is worthy of a
feature-length documentary itself. If ``The Last Days'' has a flaw,
it is that the stories have been so abbreviated to keep the film
moving quickly that they feel incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   The individuals, brave as they are, are not as memorable as the
stories they tell. But Moll has done a fine job selecting the
stories that have the greatest metaphoric resonance. One of the
most vivid is Ms. Zisblatt's account of her deportation to
Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, her mother had sewn a few diamonds into the hem
of her dress. Arriving at Auschwitz she was strip-searched and hid
the gems in her mouth and eventually had to swallow them. By
swallowing them repeatedly and then retrieving them when she went
to the bathroom, she was able to hold on to the diamonds for the
duration of her stay. They have since been incorporated into a
menorah that has become a family heirloom.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sufferings it recounts, ``The Last Days'' could
almost be described as a warmhearted film. The hatred and cruelty
visited upon its subjects is not reciprocated. All five of the
subjects have built valuable, creative lives. Their willingness to
contemplate the unthinkable, to describe their horrifying
experiences, attests to their hope that humanity can learn from the
past. &QL;

GORE`S NO BORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c. 1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whatever happens in the Senate to his boss, Vice
President Al Gore is having a good political year.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will survive, but he is already the ghost of
power past. The future leadership of the Democratic party is
passing invisibly, irrevocably to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   The veep is suddenly free _ free at last _ of his most serious
potential primary challenge for the 2000 Democratic presidential
nomination. When House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt announced
that he would not run for president, he handed Gore a golden
opportunity to unite the party's moderate and liberal wings and
neutralize the nasty in-fighting of which Democrats are so fond.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's two other possible challengers on the left, former New
Jersey Sen. BIll Bradley and Jesse Jackson, trail Gore badly in
organization, fund-raising, grassroots support and political
visibility. They are barely in the race at all.
</P>
<P>
   And as the country has become increasingly impatient to end the
impeachment charade, Gore has become increasingly bolder, going his
own way on the campaign trail. He is still loyal to his friend and
mentor in the White House, but he has clearly been given a much
longer leash on which to operate.
</P>
<P>
   The Nexis research service filed 780 stories about Gore's
activities in the past week alone.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Gore made two trips to California and visited Iowa,
Florida, Colorado, Arizona, New York and Pennsylvania. Most of the
time he traveled solo, although sometimes he appeared with the
president. He brought administration-approved federal goodies for
many of the localities, starred at blockbuster fund-raising events
and steadily accumulated commitments of support from city and state
officials.
</P>
<P>
   He has carved out special issues to advocate that the president
has never stressed, establishing his own identity. In his frequent
travels abroad, he represents the administration not merely in
ceremonial ways but in serious policy discussions.
</P>
<P>
   There is a danger in this of upstaging the president, but
Clinton seems to approve of Gore's new public independence. The
president may be motivated by more than friendship; in case he
needs a criminal pardon, Clinton is more likely to get it from a
President Gore than a Republican successor.
</P>
<P>
   The new federal budget was dubbed the Clinton-Gore budget. Many
administration announcements are reserved for Gore to reveal before
relevant constituencies. The Clinton and Gore staffs coordinate and
overlap. It is all quite remarkable, considering the history of the
two unequal jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In the good old days, American vice presidents, like children,
were meant to be seen and not heard, a secondary presence rendered
harmless through silence. Their usefulness, beyond serving as
fodder for silly jokes, was about that of the human appendix.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Hubert Humphrey used to complain that he was only
interviewed by national media reporters in August, when all other
sources of information were on vacation. An officially scheduled
luncheon once a week was the only way Walter Mondale regularly got
to see President Carter.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush confessed that during his eight years as veep he had
never been invited by President Ronald Reagan into the family
living quarters upstairs at the White House. If Dan Quayle was ever
consulted by President Bush on a serious issue, nobody knows about
it.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Gore mostly played a dodge game, escaping
several political bullets that could have punctured his hopes of
moving into the White House. He stuck to the president's side, kept
a low profile, minded his manners and bided his time.
</P>
<P>
   But the political dam began to break his way when Attorney
General Janet Reno decided not to approve an outside special
counsel to investigate Gore's controversial habit of dialing for
dollars during the 1996 presidential campaign. Instead of becoming
a central target of the campaign finance scandal, he remained a
peripheral figure.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, he has not been personally dragged into the
tawdry story of the president's Oval Office affair with Monica
Lewinsky that underlies the House impeachment and Senate trial.
Gore's own reputation as a faithful husband and high-minded, if
sometimes boring, public servant remains intact. And insofar as
anyone knows, Gore only learned about Monica when the rest of us
did.
</P>
<P>
   In a January USA Today/CNN Gallup poll, 69 percent of those
surveyed said Gore was honest and trustworthy; by contrast, only 24
percent said Clinton had those traits. And 71 percent said Gore
provides moral leadership, although just 20 percent said Clinton
did so.
</P>
<P>
   Gore receives a 64 percent approval rating for the way he
handles his job, slightly less than Clinton's 69 percent. Not bad
for a fellow in an odd, undefined job constitutionally trapped in a
subordinate status.
</P>
<P>
   If his closeness to our disgraced president is not a major
handicap in the Democratic party, it could raise problems in a
general election. Voters indicated in the USA Today/ CNN poll that
it's a toss-up whether his close association with Clinton helps or
hurts. And in recent trial heats, Gore loses to the two leading GOP
contenders, Texas GOP Gov. George W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's future will rise or fall on Gore's own performance.
He is taking nothing for granted, working to loosen up his wooden
image and campaigning as though his life depended upon it. Whatever
else you think of Gore, this man is a worker.
</P>
<P>
   But the election is nearly two years away, and anything can
still happen. And probably will.

WASHINGTON DRAMA, OFF CAPITOL HILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds. Optional sidebar with schedule for current D.C. theaters is
at end of article.) 
(js) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For New York playgoers seeking the adventurousness and vitality
of a serious theater town that can provide everything from
sophisticated classics to world-premiere musicals, here's a travel
tip: Don't rely only on your Metrocard.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the Metroliner.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a three-hour train ride from the Manhattan theater
district lies a city where the majority of standing ovations still
occur during State of the Union addresses, where the hottest acts
invariably are the ones that get voted on in Congress. But while
politics and government will always be Washington's favorite
spectator sports, they are far from the only local sources of
drama. Increasingly, the capital has been making its presence felt
as a significant force in American theater.
</P>
<P>
   Once known primarily as a way station on the road to Broadway,
the city still occasionally performs that role. The New York-bound
``Annie Get Your Gun'' recently concluded a tryout in Washington,
where Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Whistle Down the Wind'' crashed and
burned two years ago. But the city has evolved into a splendidly
diverse theater destination unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   With five first-class theater troupes _ the venerable Arena
Stage, the Shakespeare Theater, the Woolly Mammoth Theater Company,
the Signature Theater and the Studio Theater _ dozens of smaller
companies and several major houses for the presentation of touring
productions, including the Kennedy Center, Washington can easily
claim a spot along with Seattle and Minneapolis in the top tier of
American theater locales just below New York, Chicago and Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The maturing of these companies has created a more
self-sustaining theater world and has helped the city emerge a bit
from New York's cultural shadow. Washington's leading theater
people, like Howard Shalwitz, Woolly Mammoth's artistic director,
and Joy Zinoman, who holds the same title at the Studio Theater,
say the talent pool has expanded; more actors who live in
Washington can now make a living there. Playwrights nurtured in the
city, like Nicky Silver, at the Woolly Mammoth, and Lisa Loomer, at
the Arena, have gone on to major off-Broadway productions.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, though, the Washington theater development
generating most of the buzz emanates from the 136-seat Signature,
in suburban Arlington, Va., where a whiz of an artistic director,
Eric D. Schaeffer, is staging the premiere of a new musical by the
``Chicago'' songwriting team of John Kander and Fred Ebb. With a
book by Joseph Stein, ``Over and Over'' is based on Thornton
Wilder's ``Skin of Our Teeth'' and features Dorothy Loudon, David
Garrison, Linda Emond, Mario Cantone and Sherie Scott. It has
already sold out through the end of February, and if it's a
critical hit, the show will certainly cement the reputation of
Schaeffer's innovative 10-year-old theater.
</P>
<P>
   I've seen about a dozen productions in Washington in my
two-and-a-half years as a reviewer. Each time I go, I look forward
to returning. The satisfactions have been surprising and
cumulative; for example, in late 1997 a moving revamped version of
the musical ``Working'' at Signature and a tender, human Othello
from Patrick Stewart at the Shakespeare, and, last fall, a loose
and blazingly inventive ``Waiting for Godot'' by Ms. Zinoman at the
Studio Theater that was far superior to a version staged a month
later at the Classic Stage Company in New York, with John Turturro
and Tony Shalhoub.
</P>
<P>
   On my most recent visit in January, my rising expectations were
met by two of the three productions I attended, a snazzy revival of
``The Women'' by Clare Boothe Luce, in the round at the Arena, and
a stimulating staging of the rarely produced ``King John,'' at the
Shakespeare. Only Woolly Mammoth, the most daring of the Washington
companies, had a major disappointment with ``The Last Orbit of
Billy Mars,'' an overwrought new play by Robert Alexander that was
in every sense a bloody mess. (All three are currently running.)
</P>
<P>
   What alchemy, though, accounts for the city's vibrant theatrical
brew? Why is it that Washington has become such fertile turf for
theater artists when, for instance, similarly sized Boston is,
aside from the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge,
comparatively barren?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Shalwitz, a Buffalo native and actor who
helped found Woolly Mammoth in New York and moved it to Washington
in the early 1980s after deciding an audience might be found there
for offbeat drama. The theater has carved a niche as a producer of
slightly outrageous plays by the likes of Silver, Wallace Shawn and
Harry Kondoleon. Shalwitz directs new plays in New York as well. A
few years ago, he staged a well-received production of ``Quills,''
by Doug Wright, at the New York Theater Workshop, and he recently
directed another Woolly Mammoth export, Amy Freed's
``Freedomland,'' at Playwrights Horizons.
</P>
<P>
   The company has inhabited its 132-seat theater, a former
automobile showroom, for 13 years. ``And it's funny,'' he said,
``because there are so many things that make you think it would be
harder to do theater here than other cities. The grant money per
capita from foundations is low; the population is transient. But on
the other hand you have a very educated community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zinoman's Studio Theater, currently offering a production of
Alfred Uhry's ``Last Night of Ballyhoo,'' is in the midst of an
ambitious retrospective it calls the Millennium Project, in which
it is presenting what it considers a seminal work from each decade
of the 20th century. She says the revolution in Washington theater
has made drama a viable local industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actors can have a life here,'' she said, adding that her
own company has trained stage performers familiar to New Yorkers,
like Veanne Cox and Cotter Smith. Her subscribers, too, who used to
be more dependent on out-of-town trips for their theater fixes, are
staying home. ``My audience used to go to New York more. Now they
don't seem to go as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Having spent some time mixing with Washington audiences, I don't
think this is mere home-town boosterism. Attending a play at the
Arena or the Woolly Mammoth, you can sense the air of dedication in
the theater.
</P>
<P>
   By New York standards, Washingtonians are positively genteel in
their theatergoing habits. They're silent; they remain alert, and,
in a charming local custom, they actually stay until the end of the
play. When the lights come up at intermission, the spectators head
for the lobby without their coats. More and more in New York, it
seems, playgoers abandon productions at the halfway point. After
intermission, the abundance of freshly deserted seats can give the
auditorium the look of a picked-over garden. In Washington the
audience remains intact all the way through the curtain calls.
</P>
<P>
   The attentiveness may be attributable partly to the politesse of
a city with roots in Southern graciousness. But the fare at the
major theaters is often worth staying for.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   This is not an absolute rule. A couple of seasons ago, for
example, a production of ``Mourning Becomes Electra'' with Kelly
McGillis at the Shakespeare Theater was a popular and critical
success with Washingtonians, but it seemed to me a clinical and
stiff affair, bloodless and nearly endless. More frequently,
however, my response has been closer to my admiration for the
current offering at the Shakespeare, ``King John.''
</P>
<P>
   The work, though popular in Shakespeare's time, is widely
regarded today as a minor history play. The king is a weak,
vacillating monarch, tied to the apron strings of his fearsome
mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine, and with a contestable claim to the
English throne.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Kahn, the Shakespeare's longtime artistic director,
wisely stages ``King John'' as a turbulent epic, with filmic
freeze-frame battle scenes that recall ``Braveheart'' and Kenneth
Branagh's ``Henry V.'' And he locates in the unlikely alliance of
the craven ruler _ deftly imbued by Philip Goodwin with an aura of
fragility _ and Philip Faulconbridge, (Edward Gero), the complexly
human bastard son of Richard the Lion-Hearted, a story of the
highborn brought low and the lowborn exalted.
</P>
<P>
   The story of John that Shakespeare relates has a peculiarly
contemporary feel in its dissection of the nature of power and of
questions about the very idea of legitimacy. On Ming Cho Lee's
monumental set, which melds modern and medieval influences, Kahn,
Goodwin and Gero explore the legal and psychological holds the
governor has on the governed, culminating in a scene that eerily
foreshadows the current debate over high crimes and misdemeanors.
It is left to Faulconbridge, Shakespeare's ``good'' illegitimate
son, to warn of the dangers to the nation in the arbitrary deposing
of a leader, no matter what his flaws.
</P>
<P>
   If any failing in the production is worth mentioning, it's a
certain colorlessness, a lack of fleshed-out personality, in many
of the performances, including Gero's. There are notable
exceptions: Andrew Long and Ted van Griethuysen are excellent as,
respectively, a conflicted henchman of the king and an insidious
emissary of the pope. And a lack of robustness in the Shakespearean
ranks, it should be added, is an even more entrenched problem in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   At the Arena Stage, a feeling of freshness is detectable, and
not only because the theater, which in the 1960s was in the
vanguard of the blossoming regional theater movement, has a new
artistic director in Molly Smith. The energy is also being
generated by a 63-year-old play that is one of the most
gender-specific of all time: ``The Women,'' an acidic comedy with
44 parts, played in this vivid, eye-catching production by 18
actresses, most of them familiar to Washington audiences, and many
of them good.
</P>
<P>
   Woolly Mammoth's production of ``The Last Orbit of Billy Mars''
by its resident playwright, Alexander, puts on display an efficient
cast, but the play itself is an unfortunate mishmash of obvious
family secrets and credulity-straining sex and violence. Ostensibly
it's the story of a young lesbian, played by Taunya Martin, who is
living with her mother (Beverly Cosham) and is wooed by
relentlessly romantic Billy Mars (Craig Wallace) over the
objections of her possessive brother (Doug Brown).
</P>
<P>
   The play is scrambled Tennessee Williams, a version of ``The
Glass Menagerie'' as Alexander imagines it with echoes in a
run-down neighborhood in the St. Louis of today, right down to
references to a ``gentleman caller.'' In this version, however, the
disaffected brother has the hobbled walk, and the sister's psychic
disability is traceable to the family's particularly brutal
history. The playwright, however, seems just as eager to abuse the
material, because ``The Last Orbit'' deteriorates rapidly into a
kind of live-action slasher movie.
</P>
<P>
   If the revivals remain stronger than the new plays I've seen,
that may be a sign that Washington's theater identity is still a
work in progress. Unlike, say, Chicago _ which regularly sends New
York works that range from Steppenwolf Theater's ``Grapes of
Wrath'' and ``Buried Child'' to the Goodman Theater's current
``Death of a Salesman'' with Brian Dennehy and Elizabeth Franz _
Washington is not yet a net exporter of the local crop.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it doesn't take much for a theater town to enlarge its
dot on the map. And if any city seems poised to do so, it's
Washington. As in any sturdy edifice run by loving landlords, the
structure is solid.

OCCUPIED PARIS AND THE POLITICS OF PICASSO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, nothing about Picasso's life or work is still
unexamined. Several generations of biographers, autobiographers,
historians, novelists, filmmakers, Spanish nationalists, Basque
nationalists, communists, psychologists, feminists and just about
everyone else with some stake in the art and culture of the 20th
century have hashed over his career.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Picasso has been an elastic subject, an artist of
quixotic style and mesmeric narcissism, suited to the modern
industry of reinterpretation, which, in turn, has supported the
equally fertile and even more profitable business of the
blockbuster show.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't be surprised, when the history of 20th-century art is
written in another hundred years, to discover that Picasso's work
is no longer valued as highly as it is now, taste being fickle. But
I would wager that he remains the prime example of modern art's
folie a deux with mass taste and its peculiar version of the cult
of the genius, which during this era has become virtually
synonymous with fame. It is fame that fuels the public's seemingly
unquenchable desire for more Picasso exhibitions _ fame and sheer
admiration, which, we should note, do not necessarily have anything
to do with the public's esthetic sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is simply to state at the start why, inevitably, the
latest Picasso exhibition, ``Picasso and the War Years:
1937-1945,'' organized by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco
and opening Friday at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, does not
come as a revelation, notwithstanding its hopeful claim to examine
an ``understudied period'' of Picasso's career. The landmark work
of the period is maybe the most famous painting of the century,
``Guernica,'' so how understudied can this period be? ``Guernica''
is not in the show, but a good number of studies for it and other
pictures related to it, including several of the familiar ``Weeping
Women,'' are here.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the art on view at the Guggenheim is therefore familiar.
But the exhibition and its accompanying catalog are nonetheless not
to be dismissed, because at their core is a fascinating subject
that, like all complex issues of private morality, cannot be
exhausted and will probably never be resolved to everyone's
satisfaction. That subject is the character of Picasso's life and
politics in occupied Paris.
</P>
<P>
   We are dealing in this case with an issue of moral relativism
faced by nearly everyone who survived the Nazi period in Europe.
Picasso, in a sense, was merely a conspicuous case. We know this
about him: He had not been politically engaged until the Spanish
Civil War in the mid-1930s caused him, among other things, to make
the ``Dream and Lie of Franco,'' an etching that he sold to support
the Republican government. ``Guernica,'' his response to the Nazi
bombing of a Basque town that he had never seen, was painted for
the Spanish Republican pavilion at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   It's useful, nevertheless, to remember that when Picasso was
first commissioned to do the work for the pavilion, he chose a
nonpolitical theme _ an artist and model _ only transforming it at
a late date into the subject of the bombing. The final result
disappointed some Republicans and their allies anyway. They thought
it should have been even more explicit.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II began, Picasso chose to stick it out in his
studio on the Rue des Grands-Augustins. He was not allowed to
exhibit, but he managed to have paintings sold, some of which were
bought by Germans, and he lived far more comfortably than most
people did. Hitler had declared him to be a ``degenerate'' artist,
and, according to one document, the German authorities ordered
Picasso to report for a physical examination, a prelude to
deportation to a labor camp. He evaded this order, perhaps through
the intervention of Arno Breker, Hitler's favorite sculptor.
</P>
<P>
   Questions have been raised ever since. Why did he stay when he
had the chance to emigrate? Was he secretly helping the Resistance?
Conversely, did he get special treatment from the Germans? Whom did
his presence in Paris benefit more, the occupiers (in terms of
their credibility) or the occupied (in terms of solace)? Or did it
somehow benefit both?
</P>
<P>
   After the war he declared himself a communist. Stalin hated
modern art as much as Hitler did, but the communists had been
enemies of the fascists, and many of Picasso's friends in Paris
were members of the French Communist Party. So now the world's most
prominent modern artist was suddenly Stalin's ally _ or at the
least, he lent his enormous prestige to the communist side at the
start of the Cold War. What was the true nature of his political
conviction?
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of all these questions is the most obvious one: how
much can any of this _ his Spanish Republicanism, his sentiments
about the occupation, his communist conversion _ be detected in his
art? This is the real subject of the present exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   It is a handsome, tendentious display of roughly 80 paintings,
drawings, prints and sculptures (including ``Man With a Lamb'')
from among the hundreds of works Picasso turned out during the war.
We may tend to imagine the art of these years in black, white and
gray, the ``Guernica'' palette, but many of the works are orange,
yellow, red, purple and blue: Picasso was a more vivid and original
colorist than people think.
</P>
<P>
   His paint was applied in fast, free, sometimes whimsical dashes
and scrawls. A good example, ``Woman in a Gray Hat Seated in an
Armchair,'' with its scribbled line, pink flesh, scarlet lips and
goggle-eyed, split-view face, looks like the prime source for de
Kooning's blowsy ``Women'': jaunty, cartoonish and fresh. The
overall effect is of an immediacy and a total, almost arrogant
linear command.
</P>
<P>
   A new (for Picasso) kind of distortion affects many of his
wartime figures, their abstracted faces twisted like slabs of hard,
flat rubber into knots or made to look like blocks of jagged
crystal. The expressions (those of the ``Weeping Women'' aside)
tend to be wide-eyed but impassive. These are mute monsters,
occupying confined, hermetic spaces. Figure and room are often
knitted together by an obsessive tangle of spiky lines.
</P>
<P>
   A few motifs _ skulls, candles, pitchers, food _ dominate the
many still lifes he painted. Food, of course, was scarce (although
Picasso had his sources), and so was heat. One of the better
pictures is a view from the inside of his studio through a window.
In the foreground is a big radiator. The colors are brown and
ice-blue and, as with his paintings of figures, the impression is
of a solid mass, a kind of frozen sculptural form, not an open,
airy space.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The organizers of the show, echoing what writers have noticed
before, see these pictures as having been strongly affected by the
occupation: the still lifes, for instance, are memento mori, the
figure studies reflect his own solitude.
</P>
<P>
   To a degree this is simply undeniable. After the liberation in
1944, Picasso told an American journalist that he had not
explicitly painted the war ``because I am not the kind of painter
who goes out like a photographer for something to depict.'' (He
said this before he had painted ``The Charnel House'' or ``Monument
to the Spanish Who Died for France,'' the two big polemical works
that end the show.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Picasso went on, ``I have no doubt that the war is in
these paintings I have done. Later on perhaps the historians will
find them and show that my style has changed under the war's
influence.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course that's exactly what has happened. Everyone has
detected the war, at least implicitly, in many of these pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But it is  &UR; not &LR;  in some of them, too. With Picasso, more than
with most artists, the tendency has been to interpret his works as
if each object had a specific symbolic meaning to be decoded. Art
historians have become like oracles delivering the word from
Montparnasse. We have been told that the ``Weeping Women'' are
portraits of Dora Maar and victims of the Spanish Civil War and
Medusa and Mary Magdalene. You can take your pick.
</P>
<P>
   I am exaggerating, and the organizers of this exhibition
(principally Steven Nash of the San Francisco museums, with Robert
Rosenblum at the Guggenheim), to their credit, have wisely left
themselves interpretative wiggle room. The interesting catalog is
written by art historians of sometimes contradictory views, which
seems a prudent approach because with Picasso the key word remains
ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   The best wartime paintings are good precisely because they are
not specifically about anything. ``Guernica'' may be famous and
virtuous, but it is a hodgepodge of Cubist design enlarged to the
scale of a billboard and uneasily hitched to a program of political
dissent. Picasso probably wasn't very comfortable grafting a
political agenda onto his art because in the end his art was, like
everything else in his life, about him.
</P>
<P>
   He survived the war, as did countless people, imperfectly but
with dignity. Picasso understood what he was (a painter), and what
he was not, better than his hagiographers or detractors. About his
decision to remain in Paris rather than emigrate, as many other
prominent artists did when the Nazis invaded France, he told
Francoise Gilot in 1943: ``I'm not looking for risks to take, but
in a sort of passive way I don't care to yield to either force or
terror. I want to stay because I'm here. The only kind of force
that could make me leave would be the desire to leave. Staying on
isn't really a manifestation of courage; it's just a form of
inertia.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of the writers, Brigitte Baer, asks in the catalog: ``Why
should he be a hero? An artist is an artist; it is not the same
profession.'' Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Picasso and the War Years: 1937-1945'' remains on view at the
Guggenheim Museum, Fifth Avenue at 88th Street, through May 9. It
is sponsored by Delta Air Lines.

<P>
   The first thing you notice about William Jefferson Clinton is
how tall he is. The second is the seductive power he has of making
you feel, from the first moment of meeting, that he is someone you
know well. The third is his sharp intelligence, which allows you to
speak to him about anything at all, even the prickliest topics,
provided you know when to bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, someone not enamored of him forewarned me: ``The
dangerous thing about these gifts is that Clinton uses them to make
you feel that nothing could interest him more than what you are
saying to him.''
</P>
<P>
   I met him first at a dinner given by William Styron in his
summer house in Martha's Vineyard in August of 1995. During his
first campaign, Clinton had mentioned that his favorite book was
``One Hundred Years of Solitude.'' I said at the time _ and I was
quoted in print _ that I thought he had said it simply to pull in
the Latin vote. He had not forgotten _ after greeting me in
Martha's Vineyard, he at once assured me that what he said had been
quite sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Fuentes and I have good reason for considering that
evening as a whole chapter in our memoirs. From the beginning, we
were disarmed by the interest, respect and humor with which he
listened to us, treating our words as if they were gold dust.
</P>
<P>
   His mood corresponded with his appearance. His hair was short,
like a scrubbing brush, his skin tanned _ he had the healthy and
almost insolent look of a sailor ashore, and he was wearing a
college sweatshirt with some logo on the chest. At 49, he looked
like an exuberant survivor of the generation of '68, who had smoked
marijuana, knew the Beatles by heart and had demonstrated against
the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner began at eight, with some 14 guests around the table, and
lasted until midnight. Bit by bit, the conversation came down to a
kind of literary round table involving the president and the three
writers. The first topic to come up was the forthcoming Summit of
the Americas. Clinton had wanted it held in Miami, where it did
take place. Carlos Fuentes considered that New Orleans or Los
Angeles had stronger historical claims, and he and I argued
strongly for them until it became clear that the president had no
intention of changing his plans because he was counting on
reelection support from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the votes, Mr. President,'' Carlos said to him. ``Lose
Florida and make history.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase set the tone. When we spoke of the problems of
narco-traffic, the president heard me out generously. ``Thirty
million drug addicts in the U.S. go to show that the North American
mafia are more powerful than those in Colombia, and the authorities
much more corrupt.'' When I spoke to him about relations with Cuba,
he seemed even more receptive. ``If Fidel and you could sit and
talk face to face, all problems would completely disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   When we talked about Latin America in general, we realized that
he was much more interested than we had supposed, although he
lacked some essential background. When the conversation seemed to
stiffen a bit, we asked him what his favorite movie was, and he
answered ``High Noon,'' by Fred Zinneman, whom he had recently
honored in London. When we asked him what he was reading, he sighed
and mentioned a book on the economic wars of the future, author and
title unknown to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to read `Don Quixote,''' I said to him. ``Everything's
in there.'' Now, the `Quixote' is a book that is not read nearly as
much as is claimed, although very few will admit to not having read
it. With two or three quotes, Clinton showed that he knew it very
well indeed. Responding, he asked us what our favorite books were.
Styron said his was ``Huckleberry Finn.''
</P>
<P>
   I would have said ``Oedipus Rex,'' which has been my bedtable
book for the last 20 years, but I named ``The Count of Monte
Cristo,'' mainly for reasons of technique, which I had some trouble
explaining.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his was the ``Meditations of Marcus Aurelius,'' and
Carlos Fuentes stuck loyally to ``Absalom, Absalom,'' Faulkner's
stellar novel, no question, although others would choose ``Light in
August'' for purely personal reasons. Clinton, in homage to
Faulkner, got to his feet and, pacing round the table, recited from
memory Benji's monologue, the most thrilling passage, and perhaps
the most hermetic, from ``The Sound and the Fury.''
</P>
<P>
   Faulkner got us to talking about the affinities between
Caribbean writers and the cluster of great Southern novelists in
the United States. It made much more sense to us to think of the
Caribbean not as a geographical region surrounded by its sea but as
a much wider historical and cultural belt stretching from the north
of Brazil to the Mississippi basin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Twain, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and so many others
would then be just as Caribbean as Jorge Amado and Derek Walcott.
Clinton, born and raised in Arkansas, a southern state, applauded
the notion and professed himself happy to be a Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight, and he had to break off the
conversation to take an urgent call from Gerry Adams, to whom at
that moment he gave the authority to campaign and raise funds in
the United States for peace in Northern Ireland. That should have
been the ending to an unforgettable evening, but Carlos Fuentes
took it further by asking the president who he thought of as his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   His reply was immediate and abrupt: ``My only enemy is
right-wing religious fundamentalism.'' That pronouncement ended the
evening. The other times I saw him, in public or in private, I had
the same impression as I had that first time. Bill Clinton was the
complete opposite of the idea Latin Americans have of presidents of
the United States.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, does it seem right that this exceptional human
being should be prevented from fulfilling his historical destiny
simply because he was unable to find a private place to make love?
That is just what happened. The most powerful man in the world was
kept from consummating his secret passions by the invisible
presence of a secret service that served as much to restrain as to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curtains on the Oval Office windows, no bolt on the
door of the president's private bathroom. The vase of flowers that
appears behind the president in photographs of him at his desk has
been claimed by the press to be a hiding-place for microphones to
consecrate the mysteries of presidential audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even sadder, however, is the fact that the president only wanted
to do what the run of men have done in private with their women
from the beginning of the world, and a puritan stolidity not only
impeded him, but even denied him the right to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas invented the literature of fiction when he convinced his
wife that his homecoming was three days late because a whale had
swallowed him. Sheltering behind that ancient argument, Clinton
denied having any sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and denied
it with his head held high, like any self-respecting unfaithful
husband. In the end, his personal drama is a purely domestic
matter, between himself and Hillary, and she has stood by him in
the eyes of the world with Homeric dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to lie in order to deceive; but it is quite
another to conceal truths in order to protect that mythical
dimension of human existence that is private life. Quite rightly,
no one is obliged to give evidence against himself. For having
persisted in his first denials, Clinton would have been prosecuted
in any case _ that's what it was about _ but it is much more
dignified to perjure oneself defending the privacy of the heart
than to be absolved at the expense of love.
</P>
<P>
   Disastrously, with the same insistence with which he had denied
blame, he later admitted it and went on admitting it over all the
media, written, visual and spoken, to the point of humiliation _ a
fatal error in an uncertain lover, whose secret life will go into
the history books not for having made love badly but for having
made it a lot less glorious than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrously, he submitted to oral sex while he talked on the
telephone with a senator. He supplanted himself with a frigid
cigar. He naturally used all kinds of tricks of avoidance, but the
more he tried the more his inquisitors came up with evidence
against him, for puritanism is insatiable and feeds on its own
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of fanatics aimed at
the personal destruction of a political adversary whose stature
they could not abide. The method was the criminal use of justice by
a fundamentalist prosecutor called Kenneth Starr, whose fierce and
salacious questioning seemed to excite these fanatics to the point
of orgasm.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton we met some four months ago, at a gala dinner
in the White House for Andres Pastrana, president of Colombia,
seemed quite different _ no longer the open-minded academic of
Martha's Vineyard, but someone under sentence, thinner and
uncertain, who could not conceal with a professional smile an
organic weariness like the metal fatigue that destroys planes.
</P>
<P>
   Some days before, at a press dinner with Katherine Graham, the
golden woman of The Washington Post, someone had remarked that,
judging by the trials of Clinton, the United States still seemed to
be the country of Nathaniel Hawthorne. That night in the White
House, I realized just what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to the great American novelist of last
century, who denounced in his work the horrors of New England
fundamentalism, where the witches of Salem were burned alive. His
main novel, ``The Scarlet Letter,'' is the drama of Hester Prynne,
a young married woman who bore a child in secret by another man. A
Kenneth Starr of the day condemned her to wear a penitent's shirt
bearing the letter ``A'' of the puritan code, the color and smell
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   An agent of the order followed her everywhere beating a drum so
that pedestrians could keep out of her way. The ending must surely
keep prosecutor Starr awake, for the secret father of Hester's
child turned out to be a minister of the cult that made a martyr of
her.
</P>
<P>
   The method and the morality of the procedures were essentially
the same. When Clinton's enemies failed to find what they needed to
bring him down, they hounded him with mined interrogations until
they trapped him here and there in minor inconsistencies. Then they
forced him to accuse himself in public, and to apologize for things
he had not even done, live, using the technology of universal
information that is nothing more than a trimillennial version of
the drums that persecuted Hester Prynne.
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutor's questions, cunning and concupiscent, even
small children became aware of the lies their parents told to keep
from them how they came into being. Suffering from metal fatigue,
Clinton committed the unpardonable folly of violently punishing an
invented enemy 5,397 nautical miles from the White House, to
distract attention from his personal plight.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and a
great writer of this agonizing century, summed it up in one
inspired phrase:
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated him like a black president.''

   The first thing you notice about William Jefferson Clinton is
how tall he is. The second is the seductive power he has of making
you feel, from the first moment of meeting, that he is someone you
know well. The third is his sharp intelligence, which allows you to
speak to him about anything at all, even the prickliest topics,
provided you know when to bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, someone not enamored of him forewarned me: ``The
dangerous thing about these gifts is that Clinton uses them to make
you feel that nothing could interest him more than what you are
saying to him.''
</P>
<P>
   I met him first at a dinner given by William Styron in his
summer house in Martha's Vineyard in August of 1995. During his
first campaign, Clinton had mentioned that his favorite book was
``One Hundred Years of Solitude.'' I said at the time _ and I was
quoted in print _ that I thought he had said it simply to pull in
the Latin vote. He had not forgotten _ after greeting me in
Martha's Vineyard, he at once assured me that what he said had been
quite sincere.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Fuentes and I have good reason for considering that
evening as a whole chapter in our memoirs. From the beginning, we
were disarmed by the interest, respect and humor with which he
listened to us, treating our words as if they were gold dust.
</P>
<P>
   His mood corresponded with his appearance. His hair was short,
like a scrubbing brush, his skin tanned _ he had the healthy and
almost insolent look of a sailor ashore, and he was wearing a
college sweatshirt with some logo on the chest. At 49, he looked
like an exuberant survivor of the generation of '68, who had smoked
marijuana, knew the Beatles by heart and had demonstrated against
the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner began at eight, with some 14 guests around the table, and
lasted until midnight. Bit by bit, the conversation came down to a
kind of literary round table involving the president and the three
writers. The first topic to come up was the forthcoming Summit of
the Americas. Clinton had wanted it held in Miami, where it did
take place. Carlos Fuentes considered that New Orleans or Los
Angeles had stronger historical claims, and he and I argued
strongly for them until it became clear that the president had no
intention of changing his plans because he was counting on
reelection support from Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forget the votes, Mr. President,'' Carlos said to him. ``Lose
Florida and make history.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase set the tone. When we spoke of the problems of
narco-traffic, the president heard me out generously. ``Thirty
million drug addicts in the U.S. go to show that the North American
mafia are more powerful than those in Colombia, and the authorities
much more corrupt.'' When I spoke to him about relations with Cuba,
he seemed even more receptive. ``If Fidel and you could sit and
talk face to face, all problems would completely disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   When we talked about Latin America in general, we realized that
he was much more interested than we had supposed, although he

   Mark Twain, William Faulkner, John Steinbeck and so many others
would then be just as Caribbean as Jorge Amado and Derek Walcott.
Clinton, born and raised in Arkansas, a southern state, applauded
the notion and professed himself happy to be a Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   It was close to midnight, and he had to break off the
conversation to take an urgent call from Gerry Adams, to whom at
that moment he gave the authority to campaign and raise funds in
the United States for peace in Northern Ireland. That should have
been the ending to an unforgettable evening, but Carlos Fuentes
took it further by asking the president who he thought of as his
enemies.
</P>
<P>
   His reply was immediate and abrupt: ``My only enemy is
right-wing religious fundamentalism.'' That pronouncement ended the
evening. The other times I saw him, in public or in private, I had
the same impression as I had that first time. Bill Clinton was the
complete opposite of the idea Latin Americans have of presidents of
the United States.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, does it seem right that this exceptional human
being should be prevented from fulfilling his historical destiny
simply because he was unable to find a private place to make love?
That is just what happened. The most powerful man in the world was
kept from consummating his secret passions by the invisible
presence of a secret service that served as much to restrain as to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   There are no curtains on the Oval Office windows, no bolt on the
door of the president's private bathroom. The vase of flowers that
appears behind the president in photographs of him at his desk has
been claimed by the press to be a hiding-place for microphones to
consecrate the mysteries of presidential audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Even sadder, however, is the fact that the president only wanted
to do what the run of men have done in private with their women
from the beginning of the world, and a puritan stolidity not only
impeded him, but even denied him the right to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas invented the literature of fiction when he convinced his
wife that his homecoming was three days late because a whale had
swallowed him. Sheltering behind that ancient argument, Clinton
denied having any sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, and denied
it with his head held high, like any self-respecting unfaithful
husband. In the end, his personal drama is a purely domestic
matter, between himself and Hillary, and she has stood by him in
the eyes of the world with Homeric dignity.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing to lie in order to deceive; but it is quite
another to conceal truths in order to protect that mythical
dimension of human existence that is private life. Quite rightly,
no one is obliged to give evidence against himself. For having
persisted in his first denials, Clinton would have been prosecuted
in any case _ that's what it was about _ but it is much more
dignified to perjure oneself defending the privacy of the heart
than to be absolved at the expense of love.
</P>
<P>
   Disastrously, with the same insistence with which he had denied
blame, he later admitted it and went on admitting it over all the
media, written, visual and spoken, to the point of humiliation _ a
fatal error in an uncertain lover, whose secret life will go into
the history books not for having made love badly but for having
made it a lot less glorious than it should be.
</P>
<P>
   Ludicrously, he submitted to oral sex while he talked on the
telephone with a senator. He supplanted himself with a frigid
cigar. He naturally used all kinds of tricks of avoidance, but the
more he tried the more his inquisitors came up with evidence
against him, for puritanism is insatiable and feeds on its own
excrement.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a vast and sinister conspiracy of fanatics aimed at
the personal destruction of a political adversary whose stature
they could not abide. The method was the criminal use of justice by
a fundamentalist prosecutor called Kenneth Starr, whose fierce and
salacious questioning seemed to excite these fanatics to the point
of orgasm.
 &UR; -0- &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Bill Clinton we met some four months ago, at a gala dinner
in the White House for Andres Pastrana, president of Colombia,
seemed quite different _ no longer the open-minded academic of
Martha's Vineyard, but someone under sentence, thinner and
uncertain, who could not conceal with a professional smile an
organic weariness like the metal fatigue that destroys planes.
</P>
<P>
   Some days before, at a press dinner with Katherine Graham, the
golden woman of The Washington Post, someone had remarked that,
judging by the trials of Clinton, the United States still seemed to
be the country of Nathaniel Hawthorne. That night in the White
House, I realized just what that meant.
</P>
<P>
   The reference was to the great American novelist of last
century, who denounced in his work the horrors of New England
fundamentalism, where the witches of Salem were burned alive. His
main novel, ``The Scarlet Letter,'' is the drama of Hester Prynne,
a young married woman who bore a child in secret by another man. A
Kenneth Starr of the day condemned her to wear a penitent's shirt
bearing the letter ``A'' of the puritan code, the color and smell
of blood.
</P>
<P>
   An agent of the order followed her everywhere beating a drum so
that pedestrians could keep out of her way. The ending must surely
keep prosecutor Starr awake, for the secret father of Hester's
child turned out to be a minister of the cult that made a martyr of
her.
</P>
<P>
   The method and the morality of the procedures were essentially
the same. When Clinton's enemies failed to find what they needed to
bring him down, they hounded him with mined interrogations until
they trapped him here and there in minor inconsistencies. Then they
forced him to accuse himself in public, and to apologize for things
he had not even done, live, using the technology of universal
information that is nothing more than a trimillennial version of
the drums that persecuted Hester Prynne.
</P>
<P>
   From the prosecutor's questions, cunning and concupiscent, even
small children became aware of the lies their parents told to keep
from them how they came into being. Suffering from metal fatigue,
Clinton committed the unpardonable folly of violently punishing an
invented enemy 5,397 nautical miles from the White House, to
distract attention from his personal plight.
</P>
<P>
   Toni Morrison, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature and a
great writer of this agonizing century, summed it up in one
inspired phrase:
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated him like a black president.''

 &HT;    FEES FOR FEDERAL PARKS TO STAY - FOR NOW
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senators and outdoorsmen agreed Thursday that the
trail has been rocky but promising in an experimental program that
has hiked costs for millions of visitors to some of the nation's
favorite public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the jury is still out on whether the Recreation Fee
Demonstration Project should be made permanent,'' said David Brown,
executive director of America Outdoors, the national association of
outfitters and guides.
</P>
<P>
   Enacted in 1996, the Recreation Fee Demonstration Program gave
the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of
Land Management and the Forest Service the authority to charge fees
``above and apart'' from the normal appropriations process. As a
result, the General Accounting Office estimated that the four
agencies' combined recreation fee revenues from the project's 312
federal facilities have nearly doubled from about $93 million in
fiscal year 1996 to about $179 million in fiscal year 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The increased money came from new fees on everything from
parking to canoe launching to campsites paid by visitors to popular
public lands ranging from the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia
to the Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming. The lands in the
project include Padre Island National Seashore in Texas, Castillo
de San Marcos National Monument in Florida, and the North Carolina
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held an
oversight hearing Thursday on the demonstration project and whether
it should be expanded or changed.
</P>
<P>
   An Interior Department study showed that the fees have not kept
visitors away from the demonstration sites. Indeed, visitation at
the 312 sites increased from about 243 million in 1996 to 256
million in 1998. That's about the same rate of increase as at sites
where the new fees were not imposed.
</P>
<P>
   However, committee members and witnesses agreed the program does
have problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Mount St. Helens in Washington, there are fees for
everything one can imagine,'' complained Sen. Craig Thomas,
R-Wyoming. ``The private sector, as in Disneyland, learned long ago
that paying once at the gate obtained a great deal of customer
satisfaction and good will.''
</P>
<P>
   Committee Chairman Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, warned that
participating agencies are not cooperating in some common areas _
causing visitors to pay overlapping fees. There is little
consistency in fee structure, he said, with some parks charging a
single entrance fee and others taking additional costs on
everything from film to interpretative hikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing will destroy this program faster than over-achieving
greedy managers,'' said Murkowski. ``Visitors should be given the
opportunity to rest their wallets from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   The GAO study also showed problems with distribution of the new
revenues. The program requires that at least 80 percent of the
money be spent at the site where it's generated. Advocates say the
money is needed because of a maintenance and repair backlog that
has grown steadily in an era of tight federal budgets.
</P>
<P>
   More spending flexibility may be needed, the GAO said, because
some popular sites are collecting enough fees to fix their backlog
while less visited places are falling further behind. However,
surveys show that visitors want the fees put to work where they are
generated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visitors and guests who are paying the higher fees fully
expect to see improvements in our parks, refuges and areas sooner
rather than later,'' warned Murkowski.
</P>
<P>
   Some outdoorsmen who pay the fees also had some ideas on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The program has ``almost led to a 'money grab' atmosphere within
each federal agency,'' complained Bob Jones, who takes tourists on
river trips in Canyonlands National Park and is president of the
Utah Guides and Outfitters Association. He said he now pays four
``overlapping fees'' for the same river trip.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Moreland, who represents the 232,000 easy riding members
of the American Motorcyclist Association, complained of multiple
fees being paid by off-highway riders at the Imperial Sand Dunes
Recreation Area in California.
</P>
<P>
   The sites should develop variable fees, said Derrick Crandall,
president of the American Recreation Coalition, whose members
produce products ranging from skis to tents to motorhomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it astonishing and offensive that officials in
Yellowstone National Park have publicly labeled visitors criminals
when they give or resell still-valid passes to others _ yet have
taken no action to make passes available that are valid for less
than seven days,'' Crandall told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   But most witnesses said the program should be fixed rather than
abandoned.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sally Brown is mad at the world, and if the world has
any sense at all, it will stay out of her way. Though still on the
fair side of 5, Sally has a highly developed sense of the injustice
and futility of life. Her indignation quotient is off the charts,
and her mighty bleat of a voice could bring down the walls of
Jericho. She is not, perhaps, a child you would want to shepherd
through an afternoon at the mall, but on a Broadway stage, she is
invaluable company.
</P>
<P>
   Sally Brown is portrayed by a small but definitely adult actress
named Kristin Chenoweth, who is giving one of those break-out
performances that send careers skyward in the revival of ``You're a
Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' which opened Thursday night at the
Ambassador Theater. She is also the only significant reason for
adults unaccompanied by children to sit through this mild-mannered,
sticky evening of skits and songs inspired by Charles M. Schulz's
long-running ``Peanuts'' comic strip.
</P>
<P>
   You see, Ms. Chenoweth, playing someone who wasn't even a
character in the original Off-Broadway hit of the late 1960s, is
terrifically appealing, but her Sally is simply too strident, too
angry, too agitated to ever be considered merely cute. (Considering
she wears a mop of Shirley Temple curls, this is an
accomplishment.)
</P>
<P>
   A lack of conventional cuteness was what allowed Schulz's
dot-eyed, round-headed creatures to conquer America in the 1950s.
Admittedly, a comic strip that features a dog who fantasizes about
being a World War I flying ace can be long on whimsy. But Schulz
also cannily created a world of children shaped by an age of
anxiety. The atomic bomb, Sigmund Freud and Albert Einstein were
not usual topics of conversation in ``Peanuts,'' but depression,
rejection, sour stomachs and the meaninglessness of existence were.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Brown, the ultimate loser, the boy who never received a
Valentine or won a Little League baseball game, spoke directly to
the nagging fears and self-doubts that many adults were beginning
to realize they would never outgrow. Yet he and his friends never
seemed just like grown-ups in kids' clothing. They were deliciously
sui generis figures in a self-contained universe. Translating them
from pen and ink drawings into flesh and blood performances would
seem to be impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, according to most reviews, this metamorphosis was
achieved winningly when ``You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,'' with
songs by Clark Gesner and with Gary Burghoff (who went on to play
Radar in the film and television versions of ``MASH'') in the title
role, opened Off Broadway at the tiny Theater 80 St. Marks in 1967.
A ``small miracle'' was how Walter Kerr, writing in The New York
Times, described the show. ``Almost everything works,'' Kerr went
on to say, ``because almost everything is effortless.''
</P>
<P>
   Effortless, unfortunately, is exactly what this new incarnation,
staged by Michael Mayer, is not. The production has been revised to
incorporate new material from Schulz's strips, and, while most of
Gesner's original score remains, it has been extensively rearranged
by Andrew Lippa, who also has written several new songs. The
problem isn't that the new material fails to mesh with the old, or
even that the original material feels particularly dated, though it
does bring to mind the zippy, quick-take revue format made popular
by the old ``Laugh-In'' television series.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is a matter of scale. ``Charlie Brown'' was
created for an intimate space, and it is telling that when it
reopened on Broadway in 1971, many critics felt that much of its
original charm had evaporated. For this version, the ever-inventive
designer David Gallo has filled the Ambassador stage with
neon-crayon-color sets (matched by Michael Krass' costumes) that
give an electric jolt to the lines of Schulz's fabled
draughtsmanship. But there's an uncomfortable feeling of dead air
that the cast, led by Anthony Rapp (of the original ``Rent'') as
Charlie, must work much too hard to fill.
</P>
<P>
   Songs that were created as droll, low-key character portraits
have been reconceived as showstoppers, and the frail, winsome
little bodies of these numbers just aren't up to the job. When
Linus (B.D. Wong) sings a duet with his famous security blanket,
which has been wired to dance on its own, the sequence has a
flailing, improvised quality that is the stuff of actor's
nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   So does the song in which Charlie Brown wrestles with a
recalcitrant kite. What we should be focusing on is the poor
fellow's exasperation, his sense of being eternally at odds with
his environment. Yet somehow, all I could see was the bobbing kite
string that stretched across the stage. Charlie Brown himself might
as well have been invisible.
</P>
<P>
   This has something to do with Rapp's very strange conception of
his part. The actor, who was a dynamo in ``Rent,'' plays Charlie
Brown not as an aggrieved, complaining target of the slings and
arrows of daily life, but as a passive, saintly innocent.
</P>
<P>
   With his fixed beatific smile, his hair flattened against his
head and his eyes as sweetly glazed as a Krispy Kreme doughnut, he
suggests those clean-cut young people who approach you in airports
with religious pamphlets. This is not a Charlie Brown that anyone,
except possibly some New Age cultist could identify with, and there
is a hole where the show's empathic center should be.
</P>
<P>
   As Schroeder, the Beethoven-loving pianist, Stanley Wayne Mathis
seems comparably hard-pressed to find any real character to play.
As the titanically crabby Lucy Van Pelt, Ilana Levine gives a
shtick-driven performance, hitting each word and each note as
though with a mallet.
</P>
<P>
   Wong, as a lisping Linus, fares better, though he occasionally
slides into preciousness. Roger Bart, in the plum role of Snoopy,
the charismatic beagle, incorporates some delightful doglike
mannerisms. He does a nice job with the ``Red Baron'' number, which
also offers the evening's most ingenious visual effects. But his
hymn to the joys of eating, ``Suppertime,'' which should bring down
the house, is deflatingly oversold in both the staging and the
orchestration.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer has proven himself a solid and resourceful director of
dramas with the recent Broadway productions of ``A View From the
Bridge'' and ``Side Man.'' But as he demonstrated in his staging of
``Triumph of Love,'' he is clearly less comfortable with musicals.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Schulz's characters, though cartoons, are a sly and subtle lot,
and they don't benefit from hard-sell performances. Their sweetly
neurotic souls get lost when their interpreters are beaming away
like an Up With People chorus. (The show's signature song,
``Happiness,'' is, and always was, pure syrup.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it was Mayer who was largely responsible for
shaping the interpolated role of Sally and for casting Ms.
Chenoweth in the part, and for that he deserves much credit.
Debating relentlessly with an unseen school teacher about receiving
the grade of a C on her wire-hanger sculpture, scowling at a
hopelessly tangled jump rope or vengefully explaining to Snoopy
that he is at the bottom of the family's chain of command, Ms.
Chenoweth's Sally finds a mega-volt show-business energy in life's
unresting siege of frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   This is all conveyed through postures that amazingly replicate
the stances of Schulz's drawn characters without seeming stiff (her
accusatory extended arm is divine), and her shiny, perfectly
pitched voice seems a natural extension of her physical presence.
</P>
<P>
   Watching her here is what it must have been like to catch a
novice named Bernadette Peters lighting up a musical spoof called
``Dames at Sea'' 30 years ago. Ms. Chenoweth has appeared in New
York before, most notably in ``Steel Pier'' and Encores' concert
version of ``Strike Up the Band,'' but this is the part that should
seal her reputation. This glow cast by a star-in-the-making gives a
real Broadway magic to a show that otherwise feels sadly shrunken
in a Times Square theater.

   Black Films By Mail &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Movies by black directors and about black subjects have
difficulty surfacing in Hollywood and even in the independent film
world, so it's interesting to run into all kinds of them, annotated
by the hundreds in ``Facets African-American Films on Video'' from
Facets International, the Chicago mail order company.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred titles have been organized into two dozen
categories, beginning with feature films. ``Boyz 'n the Hood''
(1991), directed by John Singleton, the first black filmmaker to be
nominated for an Oscar (at 23 he was also the youngest), and
``Menace II Society'' (1993), by Allen and Albert Hughes,
21-year-old twins, are representative of the better-known titles
among the 150 listed.
</P>
<P>
   But there are also numerous offbeat, smaller films of several or
more years ago. Set in Chicago, Akoya Chenzira's ``Alma's Rainbow''
(1994) is a lively coming-of-age film about a strait-laced beauty
parlor owner, her teen-age daughter and the wild Las Vegas-style
relative who comes to put them on the right track with the opposite
sex. ``A hip urban sitcom,'' Stephen Holden wrote in The New York
Times.
</P>
<P>
   In Wendell B. Harris' ``Chameleon Street'' (1991), a mannerly
good-looking young black man (played by Harris) passes himself off
as a surgeon, a lawyer and some other things. ``Harris demonstrates
that he's a triple-threat new filmmaker of original and eccentric
talent,'' Vincent Canby wrote in his review in The Times. If
Harris' career hasn't been marked by high-profile productions
since, ``Chameleon Street'' still stands up on cassette.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker Haile Gerima has three acclaimed small films to
her credit in the Facets catalog. Full of rich street vernacular,
``Bush Mama'' (1976) depicts the struggles of a woman on welfare
who is trying to hold her family together in Los Angeles. ``Ashes
and Embers'' (1983) is the story of an Vietman veteran who
overcomes his bitterness with the help of his grandmother and his
friends.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Gerima's ``Sankofa'' (1994), the most successful of the
three films at the box office, a fashion model on a photo shoot in
Ghana time travels back to the horrors of slavery in the plantation
South. ``No viewer can avoid the discomforting questions this film
eloquently raises,'' Caryn James wrote in The Times.
</P>
<P>
   A section devoted to early black cinema includes films by such
white directors as Otto Preminger (``Carmen Jones,'' 1954) and King
Vidor (the musical ``Hallelujah!,'' 1929), studies like the
documentary ``Midnight Ramble,'' about black film from 1910 through
World War II, and the huge ``African-American Film Heritage series,
with 10 features by black directors dating back to Oscar Micheaux's
day, in the 20s. Blaxploitation is well covered with more than 50
titles (including ``Sheba, Baby'' and about everything else Pam
Grier starred in during the 70s).
</P>
<P>
   From there the categories range widely: apartheid, writers and
artists, jazz, blues and rhythm-and-blues, opera, rock and rap.

   Antz
</P>
<P>
   Portraying an ant, Woody Allen wallows in a different angst. As
the middle child in a family of five million, Z (the voice of
Allen) tells his therapist that he's feeling insignificant. A
larger destiny awaits, however, after Z falls in love with Princess
Bala (Sharon Stone).
</P>
<P>
   With the colony threatened by termites, the ant General Mandible
(Gene Hackman) decides to defend the species by sacrificing lowly
ants of Z's ilk. For reasons he doesn't fully embrace, Z finds
himself cast as savior in an overplotted computer-animated story
that, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ``works best just
showing off its prodigious voice talent.'' &QL;

   In the 1930s, lyrical souls fed themselves on the narcissistic
conceit that the world exists for the poetry that they poured into
slender volumes. Subscribing to this illusion, Gordon Comstock
(Richard E. Grant) is so taken by a favorable review of his first
book of verse in The Times of London (never mind that the review
was written by his editor) that he quits his day job and goes off
to what he presumes is a ready-made position of rank in the world

with a weird new friend (Vince Vaughn), especially after a woman's

   As fatalities escalate, Clay becomes a suspect in serial

 `THE '60s': A SOFT-HEADED, UNCONVINCING MINISERIES  
 (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)  
 (bl)  
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Don't be alarmed by that fetid scent coming from the direction
of your television; it's borne on the winds of February sweeps,
when ratings determine future advertising dollars and viewers are
assaulted by stink bombs in the shape of insultingly bad movies and
mini-series.
</P>
<P>
   This February promises to be especially foul, loaded with
unintentionally loony versions of recent history. (A Sonny and Cher
biopic is creeping up; consider yourself warned.)
</P>
<P>
   The next expensive dud arrives Sunday with NBC's mini-series
``The '60s.'' The decade is timely for all sorts of good reasons.
On the serious side, the geological shifts of the '60s are at the
root of the culture war dividing the country now. More frivolously,
it might be fun to look back from the distance of three decades at
that garishly colorful period. And by now there is a generation of
adults too young to have any memory of the period at all. Their
reaction to this flavorless, microwavable version is likely to be,
``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   Spread over two nights, ``The '60s'' mixes historical events
with fictional characters, as trite images from the period zoom by.
The first installment, on Sunday, is not painfully unwatchable,
just dull. At the center of the series is the fictional Herlihy
family of Chicago: an overbearing dad, housewife'60s mom and three
teen-age children who in 1962 are ripe for every obvious
transformation the decade offers.
</P>
<P>
   Katie gets kicked out of a high school dance for doing the
twist. Brian joins the Marines. When he says, ``It's OK, Ma, we're
not even at war with anybody,'' it doesn't take a clairvoyant to
know he'll end up in Vietnam. Michael heads off to college, becomes
an anti-war activist and finds his true love, Sarah, the only woman
thoughtful enough to wear pearls to a protest meeting.
</P>
<P>
   It's on the second night, when the series gets to 1967, that it
becomes conspicuously idiotic. The installment begins in
Haight-Ashbury, where the troubled Katie had fled. The overwrought
scene features so many feathers and flowers in the hair, so many
beads and fringe, so many Afro wigs and street performers in mime
makeup, it resembles a come-as-the-'60s Halloween party.
</P>
<P>
   And the deeper into the counterculture the series goes, the
sillier it becomes; it's hard to depict a counterculture when no
believable culture has been defined in the first place. How is
banning the twist supposed to lead to marching on the Pentagon, or
to characters shouting phrases like ``Up against the wall,
mother!''?
</P>
<P>
   Racial segregation is the one element dealt with here that
clearly sparked '60s activism. But a subplot about a black family
makes those characters mere tokens. In the first episode, Willie
Taylor leads a voter registration march. In the second, his son
becomes a Black Panther. In both, whenever the plot turns to the
Taylors, it seems surprising they are still around in this story.
</P>
<P>
   All the grittiness of the period has been sanitized out of this
mini-series, which doesn't even have the nerve to borrow from
authentic '60s movies like ``Easy Rider.'' Instead, there are so
many techniques stolen and watered down from Oliver Stone films
that he could sue: the scenes in Vietnam borrow the close-ups and
elegiac music of ``Platoon''; when Brian returns from the war, he
seems to have inherited Tom Cruise's wardrobe, hair and mustache
from ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
</P>
<P>
   Black-and-white news film depicts everyone from George Wallace
to Robert Kennedy. But black-and-white inserts of the fictional
characters seem pompous and silly rather than convincing.
</P>
<P>
   When some central characters, after many changes and
separations, are reunited at Woodstock, it may seem a sign of the
mini-series' peace-and-love attitude. But ``The '60s'' is too
soft-headed to be considered either an idealized or revisionist
view of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Like the most burnt-out '60s survivors, though, the series has
somehow maintained its taste in music. Songs from Bob Dylan, the
Byrds, Marvin Gaye and a raft of others are heard throughout, as
they were originally recorded. The soundtrack is more authentic,
lively and revealing than anything else in these four ludicrous
hours.

DAVIS' GRADUATION EXAM FACES HURDLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Hispanic organizations and some Democratic
lawmakers are concerned that Gov. Gray Davis' plan to require high
school seniors to pass a graduation exam could cause minority
students to drop out of school.
</P>
<P>
   The concerns arose Wednesday during a legislative hearing on
Davis' four-part education package. The least controversial bill _
to boost elementary school reading programs _ easily passed the
Assembly Education Committee, but three other Davis bills are under
more intense negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is an extraordinary effort to pass the Democratic
governor's education reforms before April, lawmakers want to change
the high school test.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is certainly going to affect, more than anything
else, the Latino student population,'' said the Rev. Sal Alvarez,
with the National Association of Hispanic Priests and Deacons, who
spoke Wednesday before the Senate Education Committee. ``It could
have a very, very serious detrimental impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Davis plan would require all students, starting in 2003, to
pass a test in math and English skills in order to graduate.
Students could take the test as early as the 10th grade, and take
it unlimited times _ with different questions each time _ until
they pass. At least 20 other states have similar systems.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez said intensive tutoring and after-school programs should
be improved before students with limited English are forced to take
the test. One lawmaker suggested spending another double spending,
to $50 million, on an after-school program that began this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we raise the bar (for students), we also need to raise
the support,'' said Elena Soto-Chapa, statewide education director
for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Hilda Solis, D-El Monte, said, ``If we are demanding
education excellence, then we must provide the tools. ... I am
concerned that English-language learners are disproportionately at
risk of failing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jack O'Connell, D-San Luis Obispo, said he was planning to
offer several amendments to the test legislation, including
provisions to make sure special education students are treated
fairly and that the exam closely matches the curriculum taught in
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hart, Davis' education secretary, told the committee that
the governor ``has no interest in seeing large numbers'' of
students fail the test. But he added, ``The governor believes
strongly that if we have clear standards ... that students and
teachers can meet those standards.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1.3 million students in California public schools speak a
foreign language but little English, constituting 43 percent of the
nation's students with limited English proficiency. Spanish is
spoken by more than 1 million children in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state faces a legal mandate to make sure minority students
don't fail the proposed high school graduation test at
disproportionate rates.
</P>
<P>
   In a landmark case brought by Chinese parents in San Francisco,
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1973 that districts must take
necessary steps to ensure that students who lack English are able
to participate equally in classroom activities.
</P>
<P>
   But spending more money on tutoring and boosting education in
low-income schools may not be the whole answer, according to one
recent study.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government's largest education grant program, which
has provided $118 billion in the past three decades, has been
unable to meet its goal of narrowing the achievement gap between
rich and poor students, interviews and documents reviewed recently
by the Los Angeles Times showed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Education found that the extra computers,
tutoring and more than 132,000 teaching positions paid for by the
massive investment have been insufficient to close the gap in
reading and math performance between poor students and their more
affluent peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``From my perspective, it's difficult to dictate student
outcome,'' said state Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles. ``Other
people say the school can turn everything around. The truth is
somewhere in between, but my bias is believing that it's social
conditions, racism and poverty, and not what goes on inside the
school.''

WOMEN MAKING PROGRESS AS PROFESSORS, BUT STILL LAG MEN

   (Undated) _ ...the higher ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our situation is tied directly to our salary problems,'' said
Ron Downey, an assistant provost at K-State. Retaining women is
difficult, he said, because K-State's salaries are lower than the
salaries paid at other universities of similar size.
</P>
<P>
   Several administrators and faculty members at UMKC said the
environment there has become much more woman-friendly over the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
   Deans are trying to ensure that women are considered as
candidates to fill faculty job openings. Women who have children
and household responsibilities are less afraid to talk about them
because many male colleagues are taking on more household duties
themselves. With more women teaching on campus, there's a better
support network and a more welcoming atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the environment here now is superb. Of course, some
women faculty might have different opinions,'' said Marvin Querry,
executive dean//vice provost at UMKC. ``Historically there have
been cases where women were not treated fairly. But I would hope
it's getting more favorable. If problems exist, we try to correct
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Carla Klausner, a history professor at UMKC for more than 25
years, said she has seen ``a great deal of change here in the last
10 to 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   She remembers getting out of graduate school and hearing that
some colleges just weren't hiring women. And she felt some
discrimination when she first came to UMKC, especially because
women weren't receiving equal pay.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, women professors have received special equity raises
to make salaries more equal, she said. And more women have been
hired.
</P>
<P>
   Another female professor at UMKC, Cathy Burnett, said higher
education is improved when more women teach, because they bring
fresh ideas to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I value diversity and I think that different voices are very
important,'' she said. ``It also challenges the traditional
curriculum and that is good for critical thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   At Rockhurst College, sociology professor Marilyn Carroll said
she thinks there are many reasons for the slower rate of promotions
and pay increases for women professors.
</P>
<P>
   Some women focus more on teaching than on research and
publishing articles, she said. Research often is highly favored in
tenure and promotion decisions, which may leave women behind.
</P>
<P>
   Some faculty and administrators said they believe the current
disparities should disappear as women gain more experience as
professors, sexist attitudes diminish in society as a whole, and
more women graduate with doctoral degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are going to be a lot more women, very
highly-qualified women, available for national searches,'' Querry
said. ``The pool's getting larger.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be, Gibson said, but the associations's study confirms
that women will have to work for parity in the academic workplace.
Equality will not come without some effort, she said.

YOU CAN'T ALWAYS COUNT ON A COUNTEROFFER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Some questions from the workplace:
</P>
<P>
   --What are your chances for a counteroffer?
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume you're a valued worker who just announced a new job
offer. Now you are waiting for your current boss to try to keep
you.
</P>
<P>
   Don't hold your breath.
</P>
<P>
   Even employers who rant about high turnover and the difficulty
of retaining good people may not cough up a counteroffer. A recent
survey by Robert Half and Accountemps found that 56 percent of the
executives surveyed might try to the persuade an employee to stay,
but 42 percent said that was unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Because the unemployment rate is so low, willingness to counter
has increased in recent years, said Michelle Hersh, vice president
of the temporary-staffing service in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   But many won't counter because they want to ``avoid challenges
to their compensation scale when other staff learn of the agreement
and question their own salaries,'' she said. Also, some employers
``may have lingering concerns about an employee's loyalty after a
counteroffer is accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   --What does customer service mean to you?
</P>
<P>
   For Kansas Citian Harry Hall, it sure isn't those convenient 800
numbers. Hall spent more than an hour on the phone Wednesday
morning trying to reach an employee who works at an AT&AMP;T office in
downtown Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Hall thinks he spoke with AT&AMP;T customer service representatives
in Miami, Salt Lake City and somewhere in West Virginia. The 800
numbers are the only ones listed in the local phone book.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the life of me, I couldn't get to a living soul in Kansas
City,'' Hall said. ``No one would give me a phone number for the
office right here.''
</P>
<P>
   If it had been an emergency, AT&AMP;T would have taken Hall's
message and contacted the worker. Because Hall was trying to reach
the worker for business reasons, he was out of luck _ and not happy
about it.
</P>
<P>
   --Have you tried to give any input lately?
</P>
<P>
   I sometimes write about organizations involved in
``empowerment'' or ``teamwork'' or ``flattening hierarchies.'' The
efforts are designed to improve communication with the staff and to
hear from people whose jobs would be most affected by policies or
procedures at stake.
</P>
<P>
   That's the goal, anyway. I recently heard a real-life story that
shows how many workplaces fall far short.
</P>
<P>
   A worker told her boss, ``I have a suggestion for the suggestion
box.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't aware we had a suggestion box,'' he responded, and
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   --Do you know where your ``gig line'' is?
</P>
<P>
   The smartly dressed man knows. It's the vertical axis along
which the shirt buttons, tie, belt buckle and pants zipper should

WOMEN MAKING PROGRESS AS PROFESSORS, BUT STILL LAG MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE CARROLL and LYNN FRANEY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) Women are making inroads as professors on college
campuses but still suffer disparities in pay and promotions, a
national study shows.
</P>
<P>
   In just under 25 years, the percentage of women faculty members
has increased from 22.5 percent to 33.8 percent, according to the
study released this week by the American Association of University
Professors. But many women are in lower-level positions such as
lecturers and instructors; only 18.7 percent of the top-ranked
category of full professors were women in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   The findings do not surprise faculty members in Kansas and
Missouri. At the University of Kansas, 14 female professors have
formed a caucus to figure out why women aren't rising more rapidly
in the ranks there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not pounding our fists on the table,'' said KU law
professor Ellen Sward, one of the organizers. ``We are trying to be
cooperative. At the same time we are trying to be firm about things
we think need to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The study lists a variety of reasons why women lag behind men:
from subtle discrimination, to traditionally lower expectations for
women to the strains of juggling career and family.
</P>
<P>
   At KU, 14 percent of the full professors employed in 1997 were
women. The numbers were similar around the region. Women made up 13
percent of the full professors at the University of
Missouri-Columbia and 16 percent at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published in the January-February issue of Academe,
indicates that more than half the women are in lower positions such
as lecturers and instructors.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997-98, the study said, women represented 55.6 percent of
lecturers; 58.6 percent of instructors and 46.8 percent of
assistant professors _ the profession's full-time entry level
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although women are rapidly increasing as a proportion of the
profession they tend to be relegated to less desirable positions at
lower salaries and at somewhat less prestigious institutions than
men,'' said study author Ernst Benjamin, director of research at
the American Association of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is some evidence of discrimination,'' Benjamin
said. ``But I think also there is a pattern that women are
systematically offered less desirable positions and they take them
because they are less mobile than men _ they have to stay where
their families are _ or they work hours that are more restricted,''
also because of their families.
</P>
<P>
   Women tend to cluster in low-paying fields, such as English,
instead of higher-paying disciplines such as engineering, he said.
And because many women are new entrants in academia, they tend to
have less seniority than men, which affects their salaries and
promotions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the discrimination that goes on is subtle, said Mary
Gibson, national chairwoman of the association's Committee on the
Status of Women in the Academic Profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Subtle discrimination) is much more difficult to identify and
deal with,'' said Gibson, an associate professor at Rutgers
University in New Brunswick, N.J. ``It's done by absolutely
well-intentioned people who don't even recognize they are
discriminating.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that a male professor's research article will
be considered more valuable than a female's, even when the article
is exactly the same, Gibson said. It's difficult for society to
overcome the ingrained notion that men are more capable than women,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sward said women in the KU caucus are aware that subtle
discrimination exists, as well as some that is more blatant. They
formed the caucus last semester, she said, after receiving
anecdotal evidence that ``some women were running into problems,
some (of which were) fairly serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Sward declined to provide specifics. However, she said, ``women
should be failing at same the rate as men in promotion and tenure
and they are not.'' Women are failing more often, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The caucus had its first public meeting last week. The women are
working with administrators to gather information on equal pay,
tenure and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all on the same side here,'' Sward said.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at Kansas State, KU and UMKC said they believed
they are making progress in hiring more women and are trying to
promote more to the higher ranks.
</P>

   MIAMI _ On July 13, 1997, the government of Peru took my
Peruvian citizenship away. Now it is asking Interpol to arrest me,
my wife and my daughter. What was my crime? Believing in freedom of
the press.
</P>
<P>
   When Channel 2 in Lima, of which I was the majority shareholder,
broadcast reports on the use of torture by the intelligence
service, military involvement in drug trafficking and _ this was
the piece de resistance _ the million-dollar income of the head of
the intelligence service, the government of President Alberto
Fujimori apparently decided the station had to be silenced and I
had to be punished.
</P>
<P>
   I was a foreign-born Jew, and that seemed to be all the
ammunition they needed. I was accused of treason and of selling
Israeli arms to Ecuador when it was having border clashes with
Peru. Within days, the government ``discovered'' that my
naturalization 13 years before had been a ``fraud.'' It took my
nationality, and with it all my rights in Channel 2 (now a reliable
supporter of the regime).
</P>
<P>
   I fled the country and have been sentenced to 12 years in prison
in absentia. Peru has issued Interpol warrants for my arrest and _
as if that weren't enough _ the arrest of my wife and daughter, and
the government is now prosecuting my defense lawyers. The
government is deaf to appeals from Peru's Cardinal and groups like
the Inter-American Human Rights Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Why won't Fujimori listen? Why has the persecution against me
and others instead gotten worse?
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the military and the intelligence service
have so much control now that Fujimori is hamstrung. But it is also
true that Fujimori wants to be elected to an unconstitutional third
term next year. When Peru's Constitutional Tribunal ruled in May
1997 that he could not run again, he had the judges who voted
against him removed. To win that third term, Fujimori seems
determined to blast away any obstacle.
</P>
<P>
   One method is government-orchestrated campaigns of harassment
and intimidation, like the current one against Angel Paez, an
investigative reporter. Jose Arrieta, who was head of Channel 2's
investigative unit, suffered the same abuses and has been granted
asylum in the United States. Vicious smears and even death threats
are common weapons against such journalists.
</P>
<P>
   A key tool Fujimori uses against his opponents is the
intelligence service, which was built up to combat terrorism.
Wire-tapping of the president's critics is a specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the use of politically inspired prosecutions, like
the trumped-up case tax against Delia Revoredo. She was dean of the
Lima Bar Association and a member of the Constitutional Tribunal;
her troubles began when she cast her vote there against a third
term for Fujimori. She and her husband lived in exile for a year,
until an arrest order against them was dropped. Bogus charges were
about to be filed against Arrieta as well, and have been made in my
case and others.
</P>
<P>
   To get away with these types of things, the government needs to
control the entire judicial system. Today two-thirds of Peru's
judges have only temporary status, meaning that they hold their
positions at the pleasure of the Government and cannot act
independently.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the National Magistrates' Council, an autonomous
body established in the Constitution to appoint and dismiss judges
and prosecutors, has been largely gutted.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori is eliminating the checks and balances that make
democracy possible. This is a disastrous course, for him and for
Peru. Without the rule of law and freedom of expression, democracy
in Peru will wither, foreign investors will be scared away, and
instability will be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   True friends of Peru like the United States should be driving
that message home to Fujimori during his visit to Washington this
week.

FILMS FOR TEENS NOW STEAMY, NOT SCREAMY  
 SISSY SPACEK WILL RETURN IN 3 NEW MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ How times change. A year ago the latest crop of
films aimed at teen-agers were mostly focused on ax murders and
other staples of the horror genre. That left some of the young
viewers and not a few parents squeamish. So this year the studios
are mining the teen-age market with none of that nasty horror;
instead, the films are filled with sex.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers are proving to be one of the most consistent and
profitable niches in the movie business. Box office receipts
overall are hitting record levels, but with the cost of major
pictures soaring, transforming ticket sales into profits has been
tough. But this is not so with teen-age films, many of which cost a
fraction of a standard studio release: less than $20 million
compared with close to $50 million. In addition, if these films
catch on, teen-agers will go to see them two, three or even more
times.
</P>
<P>
   So it is no surprise that far more films for the teen-agers are
being made. In fact, this year there's an avalanche. What is
surprising, though, is that many of those movies are R rated, or at
least more sexually explicit than teen-age movies in the past, as
they turn away from horror themes and focus instead on
coming-of-age stories.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year two films aimed at the youth market have done
exceedingly well. ``Varsity Blues,'' about a group of high school
football players, has earned almost $40 million in three weeks, and
``She's All That,'' about a high school nerd (played by Rachael
Leigh Cook, above), the prom and the flowering of love, brought in
an exceptional $16 million in its first weekend. ``Varsity Blues,''
which cost about $15 million to make, is R rated, and ``She's All
That,'' which cost about $9 million, is PG-13.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up later this year is a phalanx of other teen-age films
that involve similar coming-of-age plots, including ``Cruel
Intentions,'' with Sarah Michelle Gellar; ``Never Been Kissed,''
with Drew Barrymore; ``American Pie,'' with Natasha Lyonne; ``Next
to You,'' with Melissa Joan Hart, and two with ensemble casts,
``200 Cigarettes'' and ``Ten Things I Hate About You.'' And that is
just a sampling.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Zide, one of the producers of ``American Pie,'' a
Universal Pictures release about a group of high-school students
who decide they must lose their virginity by prom night, expressed
delight that the movie had an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really feel like some of the funniest things that happen in
high school are R rated,'' said Zide of the movie, which is
scheduled for release May 28. ``We felt like the marketplace was
shifting and that the audience wanted an R rated picture.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the film, which cost about $11 million, initially
had the even more restrictive NC-17 rating, and that certain
scenes, including one that depicts a woman masturbating, had to be
modified three times before the R rating was obtained.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Tollin, the producer of ``Varsity Blues,'' said the
filmmakers believed that an R rating was necessary for the movie to
be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt pretty strongly that for the real issues kids deal
with, and the real way they talk in the locker room, it had to have
this rating,'' Tollin said. He added that there had been some talk
of watering down a few scenes, like one at a strip club, but that
the idea had been rejected, and that, so far at least, the strong
box office results had confirmed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Tollin emphasized that the movie had not been made
because of market research. ``You get in trouble when you try to
pinpoint trends,'' Tollin said. ``You have to do stories you really
like. The trend away from horror and to these other films is
undeniable this year, but it can't be planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Levy, one of the producers of ``She's All That,'' said
the extent of the movie's success so far had left him stunned.
``Shocked is the word,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the success was particularly gratifying because it
had been so hard to get some studio executives to move away from
horror pictures. ``There were a lot of naysayers,'' Levy said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that coming-of-age movies for teen-agers have
been made before; for example, ``The Breakfast Club'' and ``St.
Elmo's Fire'' were popular in the '80s. This time around, he said,
the movies are ``a little hipper, a little more edgy.'' But, he
added, ``They're still about romance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we tried to do in our movie was to look at our market and
to update the romantic comedy,'' said Levy, who has produced other
youth market movies like ``Jane Austen's Mafia,'' ``A Kid in
Aladdin's Court'' and ``The Last Time I Committed Suicide.''
``Definitely there was resistance at first because horror was so
big.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that television has introduced a new generation of
actors, invigorating the teen-age movie genre.
</P>
<P>
   ``As television has created newer and younger stars, it has
created recognition and a new platform,'' he said. ``It's not all
Tom Cruise movies. They want the new faces, and we're giving them
the new people.''

   Freckle-Faced Mom
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when her straight-from-the-plains,
freckle-faced charm seemed to define a certain kind of cinematic
character. Sissy Spacek created some of the more memorable roles of
the 1970s and '80s, noteworthy for their straightforward
soulfulness (except when she played Pinky Rose, the nasty piece of
work who double-crosses her best friend in Robert Altman's ``Three
Women'' in 1977).
</P>
<P>
   Her efforts won her five Oscar nominations between 1976 and 1986
and one statue for best actress, for her role as Loretta Lynn in
``Coal Miner's Daughter'' in 1980. But not long after, Ms. Spacek
started to fade from feature films and did only occasional
television roles. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spacek is suddenly back, appearing in two movies with a
third on the way, and she is doing parts that push her into new
terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest change is her role as Helen, the tipsy,
whacky but well-meaning mother of Brendan Fraser's character in the
forthcoming comedy from New Line ``Blast From the Past.'' The film
opens Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   She is also in Paul Schrader's ``Affliction,'' in which she
plays Margie, the girlfriend of Nick Nolte's character. And she has
a dramatic role in ``The Straight Story,'' David Lynch's next
movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really haven't a clue what my last movie was before this
group,'' said Ms. Spacek, who still speaks with the strains of her
native Texas, although she now lives on a farm in Virginia. ``I
can't even remember. When you have as long a career as I've had,
you disappear for a while. But then I think somebody said, `What
happened to her?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spacek conceded that at 49, few interesting roles were
coming her way. But she also said that once she married the
production designer Jack Fisk, settled down with him and had
children _ her daughters are now 16 and 10 _ ``honestly, that
became my focus, and it still is.''
</P>
<P>
   She said several things had drawn her back. For one, the
director and co-writer of ``Blast From the Past'' is Hugh Wilson,
her neighbor in Virginia. For another, she said, she relished the
opportunity to do a loopy comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is way, way, way against type,'' she said. ``I'm thought
of as a dramatic actress, and I just thought I might not have a
chance to do something like this again.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that despite her enthusiasm for the part, she found it
tough to switch gears.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy is much harder than drama for me,'' she admitted. ``We
do drama every day of our lives. Comedy is hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Her role in ``Affliction'' is a more traditional dramatic part,
which she said she took largely to work with Schrader.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Spacek added that, since ``Blast From the Past'' follows the
lives of a family that disappears into a backyard bomb shelter
during the Cuban missile crisis, up to the present day, she got to
age 35 years. ``That's the part I enjoyed the most,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that while she was grateful for this flurry of
opportunities, she was also glad to be emerging in another new
role, as a stage mother. Her 16-year-old daughter, Schuyler, is
about to act in her first picture, and Ms. Spacek will accompany
her to the set in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to try to just watch and offer encouragement,'' she
said.

GUGGENHEIM SHRINKS IN SOHO  
 ONE MOBILE MOBILE  
 GETTY GOES SHOPPING  
 GOING PUBLIC

   NEW YORK _ Since the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum opened its
SoHo branch six and a half years ago, there has been speculation
about how the 27,000 square feet of exhibition space would be used,
how popular its programs would be and whether the museum could
afford the high rent in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The speculation continues. After months of rumors, the museum
has closed the SoHo branch. But only temporarily, it says, while
the space is reconfigured. Once that is finished, the museum will
shrink by about 7,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   One criticism of the Guggenheim SoHo has been that visitors
entered through the museum's store in the southeast corner of the
building, which is on Broadway at Prince Street. To reduce
operating costs, Guggenheim officials said, the museum's southern
end will now be rented out to a commercial venture, yet to be
determined.
</P>
<P>
   The museum entrance on Broadway will move to the north, where
the ground floor exhibition gallery has been, with a second
entrance on the Mercer Street side of the building. The Guggenheim
bookstore will occupy half of the space, on the Broadway side; the
other half, on the Mercer side, will remain as galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, the exhibition space will remain the same, and the
museum offices will stay on the third floor and a portion of the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   When the SoHo branch opened, attendance was projected to be
about 250,000 a year. Judy Cox, a deputy director of the
Guggenheim, said that the branch had actually attracted 125,000 to
200,000 visitors a year and that it had been just about breaking
even most years. The reduction of 7,000 square feet will reduce the
museum's operating costs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With our expansions internationally we have more resources for
our large-scale exhibitions,'' Ms. Cox said. ``So we don't have the
needs we used to for SoHo.''
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for reopening the museum in May or June, Ms. Cox
said, but the first exhibition in the new configuration has yet to
be determined. The museum says it still plans to use its SoHo space
to show the permanent collection and to organize shows that explore
the relationship between art and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The store will open sooner, around March 15.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cox declined to comment on the Guggenheim's interest in
building a huge museum in Manhattan that would be designed by Frank
Gehry, the California architect responsible for the Guggenheim
Bilbao in Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Talks are believed to be under way with the city and state about
building the new museum on a portion of Pier 40, a state-owned
15-acre site along the Hudson River off Houston Street. Museum
officials are also looking at other Hudson River sites. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>

   What has happened to the 1959 Calder mobile that for 40 years
hung from the ceiling of the Chase Manhattan Bank branch at Park
Avenue and 55th Street? Manuel E. Gonzalez, director of the Chase
Art Program, said his phone had been ringing off the hook with
dealers, collectors and curators asking where it had gone.
</P>
<P>
   The mobile, one of the earliest purchases commissioned by Chase
under the guidance of its former chairman, David Rockefeller, has
not been sold. Last week it was flown to the Museum of Fine Arts,
Houston, where it is a centerpiece of ``Art at Work: 40 Years of
the Chase Manhattan Collection.'' Part of the show is also at
another Houston site, the Contemporary Arts Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all surprised how quickly people noticed it was
gone,'' Gonzalez said. When the show ends on May 2, the Calder will
return to the bank. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles keeps shopping for Old
Masters. Last week it was a buyer at both Sotheby's and Christie's
Old Master sales in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At Christie's, the Getty paid $1.7 million for a group of 20
drawings, ``The Life of Taddeo Zuccaro'' (circa 1590), drawn by the
artist's brother, Frederico.
</P>
<P>
   The museum also bought Coecke's ``Sacrifice at Lystra'' (circa
1534) at Sotheby's for $343,500. The drawing is a rare study for
one of nine tapestries devoted to the life of St. Paul, which are
considered to be among the highest achievements of the Flemish
Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The Zuccaro drawings document the toils of an artist and
culminate in Taddeo's first successful commission, to paint the
facade of the Palazzo Mattei in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the study Taddeo Zuccaro made of the Palazzo Mattei,''
said Lee Hendrix, the Getty's drawings curator. ``It's one of the
few surviving preparatory studies for his facade painting, which no
longer survives.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hendrix said the Coecke drawing was among the finest of the
artist's remaining designs for the tapestries depicting the life of
St. Paul. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Emerging artists who want to create public art works should mark
March 5 on their calendars. That's the deadline for submitting 10
slides of recent work, a resume and a brief statement of interest
to the Public Art Fund, the nonprofit organization that presents
projects around New York City. Applicants must live in New York
State.
</P>
<P>
   This is the fourth year the fund has sponsored an open call as
part of its In the Public Realm Program. Here is how it works:
Seven artists will be chosen by a panel of artists, critics and
arts professionals and paid $1,000 each to create a proposal for a
specific project.
</P>
<P>
   Three or four of these projects will be chosen for completion
over the coming year. Each winning artist gets an additional
$10,000 toward the realization of the project ($7,500 for
fabrication and installation and a $2,500 artist's fee).
Information: (212) 980-3942.
</P>
<P>
   Each artist selected will be asked to choose a part of the city
for the completed work. This spring, for example, Maria Elena
Gonzalez will create ``Floating Home'' at Coffey Park, adjacent to
Red Hook Housing in Brooklyn, which replicates a floor plan from
the apartment complex in the form of a flying carpet.

`LAWRENCE WEINER': A TO Z, WITH ESTHETIC PUNCTUATION 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Holland)  By KEN JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty years ago, Lawrence Weiner gave up painting
and made words the primary vehicle of his art. Along with
Conceptualist colleagues like Joseph Kosuth, Douglas Huebler and
Robert Barry, he insisted that communicating ideas mattered more
than creating esthetically appealing objects. Since then, Weiner,
who was born in 1942 and now divides his time between New York and
Amsterdam, has been presenting gnomic utterances on indoor and
outdoor walls as well as in the form of posters and books; he's
also produced movies and musical recordings.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that remain obscure, his texts usually describe
relations in space between objects, sometimes to drolly
self-referential effect, as in a piece that reads, ``Many colored
objects placed side by side to form a row of many colored objects''
_ the objects being, of course, the letters of which the text is
made.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner's work has established him as a fixture of the
internationally institutionalized avant garde. He's particularly
popular in Europe. His signs are always instantly recognizable for
their clean, subtly chic design and eccentric syntax and
punctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the cerebral austerity of what he does is as likely to
inspire puzzlement as illumination.
</P>
<P>
   Consider one of two installations at Marian Goodman Gallery
through Feb. 20, one of three exhibitions devoted to Weiner's work
now on view in New York. A survey of Weiner's posters is at Bound &AMP;
Unbound, and Leslie Tonkonow has a small show of drawings for
posters. The poster and drawing shows run through Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   His ``5 Figures of Structure,'' first executed in 1987, is a
sort of mural occupying four walls of the gallery. Five sentences
spelled out in simple, eight-or-so-inch-high black letters describe
five different arrangements of three slabs: ``One slab and another
slab rested against each other on top of a horizontal slab set into
the ground,'' for example. Across the room, arrangements of slabs
are diagrammed by black-outlined rectangles.
</P>
<P>
   To look at this work is to feel perplexed and almost punitively
deprived of esthetic gratification. What is the point of these
oblique descriptions? Do they refer to sculptures that might be
built, and, if so, why not build and show the sculptures?
</P>
<P>
   If language is supposed to be paramount, why must it be so
grimly unpleasant to read? Theory-minded viewers may find the
conceptual implications of this work fascinating, but a lot of
people are surely going to walk away with a shrug thinking they
don't belong to the highly specialized audience for which it seems
to be meant.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that Weiner's turn to language was motivated by
radically democratic sentiments. Words and ideas, Weiner reasoned,
can be available to anyone, unlike traditional art objects. Anyone
who sees and reads one of his works, he has declared, becomes an
owner of it. This is doubtful; how many people who have seen and
even admired Weiner's work consider themselves owners or
shareholders of it?
</P>
<P>
   It does make sense, however, to think of Weiner as a kind of
public artist, as he himself does. Out in the world, writ large on
buildings, Weiner's texts may exert an interesting resistance to
semiotic business as usual. Passers-by who never ordinarily
patronize art galleries might stop and wonder, for example, at the
big letters on a military building in Vienna spelling ``Smashed to
pieces (in the still of the night).''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, at least, Weiner's interventions in the fabric of
ordinary life might bring about subtle shifts in collective
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner's interest in the broad and cheap public distribution of
art has also resulted in an extensive body of poster work, the
subject of a survey at Bound &AMP; Unbound. Arranged to cover one large
wall, the 60 posters advance in a wide chronological wave from 1973
to 1997 and range from pieces that stand alone as artworks to
exhibition announcements to broadsides publicizing the 1980s rock
band New Order.
</P>
<P>
   What's most notable is the movement from spartan plainness to a
rich and poetic complexity. In the work of the last 10 years or so,
his design, typography and color compare favorably with the best
graphic design of early Russian or Dutch modernism.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning, a yellowed page from 1973 bears an
uncompromisingly minimal, black text that reads, in part, ``With
relation to the various manners with various things: made suitable
to/for, put out of place to/for.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end is a poster for a 1991 show at Leo Castelli
Gallery, in which black letters on a deep red field read ``Dropped
Stones'' and parentheses bracket each of four squares cut out of
the page, vacancies representing, perhaps, ``dropped stones.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the poster show, in conjunction with the show at
Tonkonow, where Weiner's elegant hand and exacting attention to
detail is evident in loosely diagrammatic drawings for posters, one
becomes convinced that whatever the philosophical interest of his
work, he surely has evolved into a superior formalist.
</P>
<P>
   Back at Marian Goodman, the other brand new installation
reflects the trend toward a more inviting formal and poetic
dimension seen in the later posters. Called ``A Basic Assumption,''
it's based on the idea, according to a gallery handout, ``that all
objects assume they are in the right place at the right time.''
Across the wall are arrayed a series of diagonally oriented
rectangles outlined alternately in metallic blue and metallic
orange paint.
</P>
<P>
   Every blue box is occupied by an orange text referring to the
location of some unspecified thing: ``Out of harm's way; a bit to
the side; more towards the light; relegated to the shadows,'' and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   For viewers who pause to meditate on this, the piece begins to
exude a persuasive psychological resonance, which is enhanced by
the optical play of complementary colors and the alternation of
vacancy and fullness.
</P>
<P>
   If you think of the unspecified object as the self, then you
begin to feel in the piece a certain tender emotional poignancy.
But if you still value art mainly for its visual possibilities, it
probably won't change your mind.

D.W. MELLOR: PHOTOGRAPHS WORTHY OF AN OLD MASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa.)  (Eds.: Exhibition notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   D.W. Mellor has had several lives in photography. He began to
collect photographs in 1969, soon after receiving a degree in
economics. He ran a photography gallery in Philadelphia from 1979
to 1982. For 30 years he was a freelance photographer who took
mostly color shots. Since 1993 he has been working on his own
black-and-white photography, focusing on a genre that would have
daunted a lesser soul: still lifes inspired by the Old Masters.
</P>
<P>
   In his photographs, about a dozen of which are at the Yancey
Richardson Gallery in SoHo, Mellor shows a firm grasp of Old Master
components: darkness and light, rhythm and balance, texture and
geometry. A few choice dinner table objects are left casually but
artfully on a plain old wood table. The natural light picks out of
the enveloping darkness the glint in the glass, the shine in the
silver, the textures on the skin of fruits and vegetables, the
polish of the table.
</P>
<P>
   Mellor reproduces in precise, exquisite detail on photographic
paper what 17th-century painters recreated in precise, exquisite
detail on canvas. More astonishing is Mellor's ability to produce
black-and-white prints whose sumptuously subtle tonalities echo the
luminous colors one would expect in, say, an old Flemish still
life.
</P>
<P>
   Because they follow a set of formal stylistic conventions,
17th-century still lifes are superficially similar yet strikingly
dissimilar when viewed closely. At a glance Mellor's images appear
to have a sameness. Up close it's another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, ``Still Life With Conch Shell, Amsterdam''
(1998), ``Still Life With Florentine Glass and Two Glasses,
London'' (1997) and ``Still Life With Twist, Venice, Italy''
(1995). The objects in each of these are arranged in a kind of
triangular formation. But the internal dialogue of the images
differs among them.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a silver conch, an ornate metal goblet and a crystal
wineglass, the first of these images has an almost spartan feel, an
impression reinforced by three groupings spread sparingly along the
length of a table. On the left is a large empty metal platter with
a calligraphic twist of lemon peel balanced on its rim, the silver
conch placed behind the plate. The second grouping includes a
peach, a large toy marble, a wineglass, a goblet and a sugar
shaker. At the right of the image is a lone marble. Supplying a
note of age-old solidity is the edge of the table, the light
detailing the wood grain and every nick on it.
</P>
<P>
   The image taken in London, focusing as it does on an ornate
goblet in cut glass and silver, is a luxurious still life. Centered
in the picture is a cluster that also includes an elaborate but
smaller wineglass and a lemon half balanced on the rim of a silver
plate. To the left is a secondary cluster of a fluted glass, a
metal plate, a pear and grapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still Life With Twist,'' however, carries a jumbled message.
There is a lovely translucent sliced fruit in the foreground and
the textures of the other fruits are nicely captured. But a lemon
peel is much too artificially hooked from the lip of a wineglass
and around the stem of a metal goblet. And a small classical statue
of a nude leaning against a pear is a jarring touch.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strangely dissonant note also appears in ``Still Life
With Standing Fork, Pacific Palisades'' (1996). Lined up on a table
are grapes piled high in a reticulated silver basket, a peach on a
plate and an old fork standing on its tines. The tip of the fork
handle may be roughly aligned with the top of the basket handle,
but the balance in the image is off, and the fork improbably
standing on tippy toes is too contrived.
</P>
<P>
   But these are only a few minuses in a show that is mesmerizing
in its radiant stillness. The highlight is ``Still Life With Broken
Glass, Amsterdam'' (1998), with its superb balancing of textures
and the play of light on the various surfaces. On the same table
shown in ``Still Life With Conch Shell'' are a 17th-century
drinking glass, a reproduction of which is broken and lies on its
side against a metal plate with a single marble on it. Completing
the arrangement is a half-peeled lemon, its cut peel spiraling
toward a knife.
</P>
<P>
   The anomaly of the broken glass works here, its jagged fragments
a textural contrast to the whimsical curl of the lemon peel. Adding
a mysterious note is the reflection on the intact drinking glass,
which seems to indicate a long room with windows on either side.
</P>
<P>
   While Mellor's still lifes show the influence of Josef Sudek, a
number of whose still lifes are on view in a separate section of
the gallery, four of Mellor's assemblages included in this
exhibition can be said to be a homage to Frederick Sommer, one of
this century's most inventive photographers. Like Sommer, Mellor
photographs images he has created by combining elements from
assorted materials, including old etchings and found objects like
pieces of wood or plaster. Like Sommer's surreal assemblages,
Mellor's are puzzling at first sight and require close study.
</P>
<P>
   ``Les Taurocathaspies, Bryn Mawr'' (1997) includes segments from
an etching of boys on horses and bulls. Because the long and narrow
print was too large for Mellor's 8-by-10 view camera, he first cut
the etching into strips. Two years later, in an abandoned church in
Greece, he found a piece of wood whose painted surface had long
disappeared. The etching strips he wanted in his image fitted
exactly on the piece of wood.
</P>
<P>
   The Sommeresque energy is very evident in ``Les
Taurocathaspies,'' which shows the boys and their animals seemingly
riding upward on a rugged terrain. While boys and animals are
bathed in a light that is broken into shards, all about them is a
murky abstraction of black splotches interspersed here and there
with light gray parallel lines.
</P>
<P>
   Two 1996 companion pieces, also using fragments from etchings,
are ``Apollo, Bryn Mawr'' and ``Last Judgment, Bryn Mawr,'' which
powerfully sum up the story of Marsyas, a skilled flutist,
challenging Apollo to a contest and losing. As punishment, Apollo
had Marsyas skinned alive. Against a beautifully floating
background of indeterminate materials, the Greek god in ``Apollo''
is wildly triumphant, almost flying out of the picture, as a foot
steps out of one backdrop into another. By contrast, Marsyas in
``Last Judgment'' is a ghostly and blurred figure. Behind him is a
large X formed by the assembled portraits of nightmarish faces that
fill the rest of the image.
</P>
<P>
   These assemblages may seem radically different from the still
lifes. But both draw their inspiration from Old Master subjects,
and both are visual deceptions that reveal themselves only if the
viewer takes the time to stop and look.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or
noteworthy movies and film series playing this weekend in New York
City. (Star) denotes a highly recommended film or series. Ratings
and running times are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   Now Playing
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``AFFLICTION,'' starring Nick Nolte, James Coburn, Willem
Dafoe, Sissy Spacek and Mary Beth Hurt. Directed by Paul Schrader
(R, 114 minutes). Nolte is devastating in the performance of his
career, as Wade Whitehouse, a New Hampshire loner fighting a losing
battle with demons from his past.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them: Coburn, terrifyingly authentic as the
drunken, abusive father who long ago cowed his sons into
submission. As directed by Schrader, this pure, unfettered
adaptation of Russell Banks' novel starts on a deceptively ordinary
note, then escalates into inexorable fury. Every little detail
matters. Ms. Spacek and Ms. Hurt expertly play the women who
trigger Wade's crisis (Janet Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE,'' starring James Woods and
Melanie Griffith. Directed by Larry Clark (R, 101 minutes). From
the director of the bruising and ominous ``Kids,'' this vibrant,
unapologetically seedy road movie is a virtual day at the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Clark's second feature may not have the sting of his first, but
it comes closer to establishing him as William S. Burroughs with a
swooping, pivoting movie camera, bringing bizarrely innocent
enthusiasm to material that might otherwise ooze druggy shock
value, and making decadence as basic as the weather. Woods, as a
junkie, thief and absurdly unlikely father figure, revels in this
full-throttle role (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``AT FIRST SIGHT,'' starring Val Kilmer and Mira Sorvino.
Directed by Irwin Winkler (PG-13, 128 minutes). In this overlong
and often desperately banal version of a case study reported by Dr.
Oliver Sacks, Kilmer plays a man whose nearly lifelong blindness
was suddenly alleviated by surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sorvino plays the bright-eyed New York career woman who
falls in love with him, then urges him to change his once-peaceful
life. But the film brings little more than case-study data to
communicating how this man's restored sight affected him, or what
made it a mixed blessing. Sample dialogue: ``Have you ever listened
to the rain? I mean, really (italics)listened?''(end italics)
(Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``CENTRAL STATION,'' starring Fernanda Montenegro,
Vinicius de Oliveira and Marilia Pera. Directed by Walter Salles
(R, 115 minutes). In this quiet, luminous Brazilian gem, a joyless
older woman crosses paths with an orphaned young boy. There's
plenty of room for sentimentality here, but the wonder of Salles'
film is all in the telling.
</P>
<P>
   As these characters develop a fractious bond, then embark on a
road trip that takes them vividly to Brazil's hinterlands in search
of the boy's father, Salles brings great tenderness and surprise to
the events that punctuate their journey. Ms. Montenegro's tough
bravura performance was one of last year's very best (Maslin). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``A CIVIL ACTION,'' starring John Travolta, Robert Duvall
and William H. Macy. Directed by Steven Zaillian (PG-13, 120
minutes). This story of a David-Goliath lawsuit against industrial
polluters, with Travolta first-rate as an ambulance chaser who
develops a conscience, could have been business as usual in the
legal thriller genre.
</P>
<P>
   But Zaillian's keenly observed, beautifully acted film, based on
Jonathan Harr's nonfiction best seller about a case in Woburn,
Mass., doesn't follow familiar formulas. It follows all the
surprises and frustrations of a story that was never black and
white and is all the better for its shades of gray. Duvall is
outstanding as a corporate lawyer full of wily tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE GENERAL,'' starring Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight.
Directed by John Boorman (not rated, 125 minutes). Boorman's best
and most stylish film in years is the deftly told story of Martin
Cahill. Nicknamed the General for his crime-plotting strategies,
this Irish gang leader and master thief is played with splendid
brio by Gleeson.
</P>
<P>
   Photographed gorgeously in black and white, the film tells of
his elaborate art and jewel heists, his unusual domestic
arrangement with his wife's sister and his singular difficulties
with the IRA and the law. Voight is outstandingly good as the
police detective who knows all of Cahill's tricks (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``HILARY AND JACKIE,'' starring Emily Watson and Rachel
Griffiths. Directed by Anand Tucker (R, 121 minutes). The parallel
biographies of the brilliant cellist Jacqueline du Pre (Ms.
Watson), who contracted multiple sclerosis at the height of her
career, and her slightly older sister, Hilary (Ms. Griffiths), a
talented flutist who gave up a professional career to marry and be
``ordinary,'' is one of the most insightful studies of sibling
rivalry ever filmed.
</P>
<P>
   Jacqueline may have won fame and glory, the movie says, but she
remained a desperately needy emotional child who had to have
everything Hilary had (including Hilary's husband). The film is
structured like a concerto, in three movements, the last of which
ends with Jackie's harrowing death in her sister's arms. The drama
is deepened by a soundtrack that makes expert use of Jacqueline's
signature piece, the Elgar Cello Concerto in E minor. Ms. Watson's
Jacqueline flames with an almost scary intensity (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``MY NAME IS JOE,'' starring Peter Mullan and Louise
Goodall. Directed by Ken Loach (R, 92 minutes). A splendid, feisty
performance by Mullan energizes this film about a recovering
alcoholic trying to rebuild his life. With humor and scrappy
intensity, Joe throws himself into coaching young athletes and
embarking tenuously on a love affair, only to find the expected
challenges to his new sobriety everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Loach's commitment to delineating social issues is accentuated
by the way his star breathes life into Joe and makes viewers root
for his success. Special bonus: this film breaks the
brogue-and-burr barrier by including helpful subtitles for the
overlapping, heavily Scottish-accented dialogue (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``PATCH ADAMS,'' starring Robin Williams and Monica Potter.
Directed by Tom Shadyac (PG-13, 110 minutes). As a maverick doctor
intent on making terminal patients laugh, Williams delivers a
little clowning and a lot of maudlin feel-good sentiment, along
with vulgarity left over from the filmmaker's ``Ace Ventura'' days.
</P>
<P>
   He also spends a lot of time being congratulated for his good
works, as the film's minor players are kept busy marveling at his
antics. The real-life story of this doctor may sound like a fine
excuse for Williams to cut loose, but the film version proves
narrow and predictable. Ms. Potter, with a nostrilly resemblance to
Julia Roberts, figures in a romantic subplot with a bizarre twist
(Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``THE PRINCE OF EGYPT,'' starring the voices of Val
Kilmer, Ralph Fiennes, Sandra Bullock and Michelle Pfeiffer.
Directed by Brenda Chapman, Steve Hickner and Simon Wells (PG, 93
minutes). First came the great expectations for this animated
magnum opus from Dreamworks. Then came reality, in a film
struggling mightily to balance animated whimsy and biblical
stature.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is an admirably worthy rendering of the Exodus story,
even if Moses must initially be seen as a playful young scamp.
Biblical plagues and miracles serve as special inspiration for the
animators' reality-bending ingenuity (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``RUSHMORE,'' starring Jason Schwartzman, Bill Murray and
Olivia Williams. Directed by Wes Anderson (R, 93 minutes). A dryly
hilarious portrait of the mogul as a young man, with Schwartzman a
real find as its perfectly horrid little hero, Max Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   Max's prep school, Rushmore Academy, does have a faculty, but
none of the grown-ups have anything like Max's natural authority.
Murray is sneakily fine as the steel tycoon and Rushmore benefactor
who happens to be on Max's own wavelength as they vie for the same
beautiful teacher. A particular treat for its skewed, outrageously
funny memories of a cutthroat boyhood (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE,'' starring Joseph Fiennes, Gwyneth
Paltrow, Geoffrey Rush, Ben Affleck and Judi Dench. Directed by
John Madden (R, 113 minutes). A witty, sexy and merrily literate
delight, with an exhilaratingly clever premise that only gets
better as the film unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay, originating as Marc Norman's brainstorm and
turned by Tom Stoppard into razor-sharp dialogue reminiscent of his
``Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,'' dares to imagine
whatever it likes about the link between Shakespeare's artistic
passions and his mad yearning for a certain aristocratic beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, this tirelessly inventive comedy envisions an
Elizabethan theater fraught with the same backbiting and conniving
we enjoy today, and has great fun presenting the creation of
``Romeo and Juliet,'' glitches and all. Fiennes and Ms. Paltrow
make a fine, tempestuous duo, and she gives the first great, fully
realized starring performance of her career (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   (Star) ``A SIMPLE PLAN,'' starring Bill Paxton, Billy Bob
Thornton and Bridget Fonda. Directed by Sam Raimi (R, 120 minutes).
This onetime cult horror director makes a flawless transition to
mainstream storytelling with a quietly devastating thriller. And
its fine cast plays out the consequences of a harmless-sounding
error in judgment that winds up leveling everything in its path.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst is $4.4 million that literally falls out of the
sky, and Scott Smith's story proves how deadly the morality of
expediency can become. When you get the shivers watching this
wintry tale, which features an especially memorable performance
from Thornton, it won't be from the cold (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``STEPMOM,'' starring Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts and Ed
Harris. Directed by Chris Columbus (PG-13, 120 minutes). A man's
ex-wife and new girlfriend lock horns over who can be nicer to his
two children, in a sudsy story made livelier by its two female
stars, both in appealingly high gear.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roberts plays the nicest person ever to wear black to a
downtown photo shoot, while the especially fiery Ms. Sarandon plays
the suburban mother as mama lion. Even when the prospect of
mortality looms, the story manages to maintain its big, lavish look
and peculiar (under the circumstances) sense of fun. As in ``Home
Alone,'' Columbus directs with sunny indifference to reality,
medical, economic or otherwise (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``STILL CRAZY,'' starring Stephen Rea, Billy Connolly, Bill
Nighy, Helena Bergstrom, Juliet Aubrey and Jimmy Nail. Directed by
Brian Gibson (R, 96 minutes). Twenty years after they last dropped
acid in a Druid circle, the members of an over-the-hill English
rock band try to reunite, and the results are meant to be both
funny and heartwarming. Not an easy mix, unless Spinal Tap really
(italics)is(end italics) your idea of a band that needs a second
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an extremely likable cast that fits right into the
spirit of things, the director of ``What's Love Got to Do With It''
and the writers of ``The Commitments'' don't drum up enough drama
or sustained humor to make the most of their premise. The cast is
cheery and game, the material hit-or-miss (Maslin).
</P>
<P>
   ``THE THIN RED LINE,'' starring Jim Caviezel, Ben Chaplin, Nick
Nolte, Sean Penn and Woody Harrelson. Directed by Terrence Malick
(R, 166 minutes). From the first frame of this huge, drifting war
epic loosely derived from James Jones' Guadalcanal novel, it's
viscerally clear that Malick is back. The exquisite, oddly detached
visual style that made ``Badlands'' and ``Days of Heaven'' the most
beautiful films of the 1970s is instantly apparent here, even if
the narrative vagueness and brooding voice-overs are also familiar.
</P>
<P>
   The film sprawls, gets lost and occasionally delivers visual
poetry, the kind that could have been greatly helped by tighter
editing. Bottom line: no one who admired Malick's early work should
miss this. But those expecting anything simple will not find it
here (Maslin). &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Film Series
</P>

`CROPPING AND PICTURE MAKING': WHEN THE EMPHASIS IS ON SELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Exhibition notes are at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By VICKI GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Photography is so simple. You press a button 24 or 36
times, take the film to the photo shop and voila, you've got
pictures. Painting, on the other hand, is so complicated: all that
imagining and drawing and constructing something out of nothing on
a blank canvas. Well, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   In 1901, when photographers were extensively manipulating their
images to prove that their work was at the same level of difficulty
and skill as any other artists', George Bernard Shaw wrote that
photography had not attracted many artists earlier because
``artists were terrified by the difficulty and mystery of the
process, which, as compared with the common run of their daubing,
in which any fool can acquire a certain proficiency, certainly did
require some intelligence, some practical science and some
dexterity.'' He went on to say: ``The artists still have left to
them invention, didactics and (for a little while longer) color.
But selection and representation, covering 99 hundredths of our
annual output of art, belong henceforth to photography.'' Note,
please, the emphasis on selection.
</P>
<P>
   It is obvious but not often pointed out that one truly essential
difference between painting and photography is the heavy weight
photography puts on selection, or editing, whether or not
photographers have the edge in that. Painters and printmakers
certainly edit. They toss out, correct, overpaint finished canvases
that no longer satisfy. But there is only so much work even a
prolific painter can turn out, and after a point history does the
major editing of a painter's work, with a helping hand from
curators and collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Photographers are capable of taking hundreds of pictures in a
single day, especially with a motor drive, and can scarcely help
taking too many to print, much less publish. Editing is an
inescapable part of the craft.
</P>
<P>
   A small but tidy lesson in the way photographers work and some
of the different modes of editing, selection and determining which
image to present to the public is on hand in ``Cropping and Picture
Making: Kertesz, Man Ray, Weston and Winogrand'' at Pace
Wildenstein MacGill. With only 30 pictures in all (though one
``picture'' is a blown-up contact sheet with many images on it)
this show works as a basic demonstration of different approaches,
all of which involve heavy pruning of one sort or another.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Winogrand and Andre Kertesz both worked in ways almost
unthinkable for a painter. Winogrand, who is often quoted as saying
that he photographed to see what things looked like as photographs,
was constantly out in the street snapping, constantly experimenting
with the look of city life and the ability of a swift eye and lens
to write it down and make it new. (The first new book on Winogrand
in years, ``The Man in the Crowd,'' was recently published by
Fraenkel Gallery and Distributed Art Publishers.) He never even got
around to editing some thousands of images _ observations made in
passing and left in heaps and drawers. Very few if any artists have
ever done so many drawings in the same time span.
</P>
<P>
   He had both nothing and too much until he selected. Looking at
his contact sheet presents a puzzle that is part of the medium's
intrigue. The chosen picture is a reasonable choice, but to another
eye there are several others just as good, or maybe just as bad.
The criteria are not obvious, but the act of selecting is at least
as important as the act of releasing the shutter and perhaps more
so, as some of the time Winogrand seems to have been shooting so
fast and so intuitively that he scarcely had time to grasp what was
in the viewfinder. Painters seldom have this kind of material and
never this amount to edit down.
</P>
<P>
   Kertesz edited at another level and at times more radically. One
of his most famous pictures, ``Wandering Violinist'' (1921), turns
out to have been cropped, something not generally known. This does
not affect the quality of the image; it only tells us something
about the way Kertesz worked.
</P>
<P>
   The big surprise at the gallery is a well-known image of a
swimmer's head reflected in the water, shown next to the original
uncropped image. It turns out that Kertesz not only cropped out the
swimmer's hands holding onto a board but also flipped the negative
upside down, so that the reflection is on top and the face reads as
reflection. Painters occasionally crop paintings, too, but before
abstraction came along it would have been nearly impossible and
afterward unlikely that a painter would turn a detail upside down
and see it become one of the landmarks of his or her work.
</P>
<P>
   Cropping is a way of life for some photographers. Walker Evans
even cut some of his negatives, so they could never be printed any
other way. Photographers who work for publications expect that
editors will do the cropping. Margaret Bourke-White was quite
accustomed to cropping her own images for dramatic effect, but when
she went to work for Life in 1936, she insisted that the darkroom
technicians print her negatives to the very edges, making their
work extremely difficult. Yet when editors cut an image in half for
visual impact, she never whispered a word of complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The recent Man Ray show at the International Center of
Photography Midtown revealed a photographer who evidently
photographed full figures or wide scenes in order to find and crop
down to the telling detail later on, unusual to this extent for a
photographer, most unlikely for a painter. There is one such
instance in this show, plus one very different example: a pair of
photograms (images produced without benefit of camera) that were
made by placing the same objects on film in contrasting
configurations.
</P>
<P>
   Here the editing is all a matter of composing and recomposing
elements, a procedure common to both photographers and painters.
The challenge for Man Ray was refashioning the image with the exact
same components; but after all, Mondrian spent much of his life
rearranging pretty similar lines and geometrical forms on canvas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Winogrand, who would not crop a photograph, worked by winnowing
out single images from a crowd of them. Kertesz ferreted out the
telling detail from a larger field. Man Ray re-edited his own
arrangements. But Edward Weston edited in his eye. Weston was
determined to previsualize his finished print in every detail and
every gradation of tone before he ever released the shutter.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, could try out varying arrangements of the same
elements, as in two nude photographs of his wife in different poses
before the sexually suggestive open mouth of an adobe oven. But if
he was photographing a world he had not arranged, he needed to find
the picture by walking through and around the territory, printing
images in his mind as he came upon them.
</P>
<P>
   At the gallery is a brief succession of pictures he took in the
Colorado desert before and after he photographed a dead man along
the way. Of this succession, only the picture of the corpse still
lives in publications of his work; like any photographer, Weston
edited out the unsatisfactory images. In the main he worked by
pre-viewing, as Winogrand in his way did by re-viewing. Both of
them were editors much of the time; there is almost no other way to
be a photographer.
</P>
<P>
   In the front room of the gallery is ``Guy Bourdin: Early Work,
1952-1960,'' another quiet lesson about photography, this one about
the difficulties of tracking the formation of a style. It helps to
know who Bourdin (1928-1991) was: a foremost French fashion
photographer, the man some credit with bringing sex and violence to
a fever pitch in French fashion magazines in the late 1960s and in
their U.S. counterparts in the mid-'70s. (Helmut Newton gets most
of the credit for that in the United States and doubtless deserves
a lot of it, but Bourdin's contribution to this dubious enterprise
is unfairly neglected because he was reluctant to show in galleries
or publish in books.)
</P>
<P>
   Bourdin did a series of advertisements for Charles Jourdan shoes
that ran in U.S. magazines, with images like one of a wrecked car,
with the outline of a body on the road and a pair of high-priced
shoes on their sides on the pavement. He also took the pictures for
a Bloomingdale's lingerie catalog in 1976 that was virtually a
study of dissatisfaction, sexual unrest and distrust.
</P>
<P>
   The early work offers scarcely a clue to this realm. Bourdin the
fashion photographer was an innovative colorist; Bourdin the art
photographer in the early years worked in black and white. Not so
many people were shooting color then, and besides, he might not
have been able to afford it. Samuel Bourdin, his son, says the
elder Bourdin was so poor he sometimes had only flour and water to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   Surely this show is not the complete roster of work from those
years, so it is not easy to judge where clues to the future sexual
obsessions might lie. But except for one picture of a young girl in
her underwear and one of an oily rubber glove that you might
conceivably make an argument for, there is not even a hint. These
are clean, pure, dark and exceedingly formal images of white
rectangles on dark grounds, cars in perfect profile before striped
walls, picket fences covered with thin lines of grass.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps when the intervening years are filled in, the ties to
the later work will become clearer, as they do in the Pollock and
Bonnard retrospectives, where viewers at least feel they can find
premonitory signs by reading backward. But don't bet on it. Bourdin
was not a fashion photographer until the mid-'60s, and a shift into
commercial work can mean a major change in style, as happened with
Edward Steichen, Irving Penn and others.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, Samuel Bourdin says that in the late '60s his father
finally got his own studio and, with all that space, began working
with props, setups, narrative, fantasy. Odd what space can do. The
New York School painters began painting enormous canvases when they
moved into lofts.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, this show suggests that the nice, neat trajectories
one might like to trace for photographers are not always so easy to
work out. Like all visual artists, photographers have to try
various paths when they begin and only in time find the road less
traveled. Bourdin was good enough in his restrained early years.
Later he could be brilliant: hateful, perhaps, at times; but boy,
did he do hateful well.

<P>
   When I was in Washington recently, nearly every media person I
talked to was hot on a rumor about that oddest of political odd
couples, serpentine Democratic apologist James Carville and
strident Republican mouthpiece Mary Matalin.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ugly rumor. Details varied depending on who was
telling the story, but the gist of it was that Carville had been
arrested after assaulting Matalin and threatening her life.
</P>
<P>
   The story was growing like a poisonous mushroom on the Internet.
In a newsgroup chat room called alt.gossip.celebrities, there was
this post:
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems that cuddly Clinton defender James `Crazyville' shot up
his house and threatened to kill his wife, Mary Matalin. Perhaps
Monica's ex-boyfriend (Clinton) may someday be his cellmate.''
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the post was a copy of a story from the Montgomery
County (Md.) Ledger:
</P>
<P>
   ``ROCKVILLE, MD _ James Carville, vocal supporter and confidant
of President Bill Clinton, reportedly spent last Monday night in
the Montgomery County Jail after he was arrested on suspicion of
firing a gun into a sofa and repeatedly plunging a knife into a
wall during a fight with his wife in their suburban home there
earlier that evening, according to local police sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carville, an internationally known political consultant and
Democratic Party campaign manager, allegedly twice discharged a
Glock 9-mm. semiautomatic pistol inside the home, damaged a living
room wall with an oversized hunting knife, threatened the life of
his wife, radio talk show host Mary Matalin, and used physical
force against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rockville police subsequently took him into custody on
suspicion of domestic violence and brandishing a weapon, both
misdemeanors. He was also charged with discharging a firearm in a
negligent manner, a violation which could be prosecuted with a
felony.''
</P>
<P>
   The story went on to say that police confiscated a cache of
weapons from the house, including ``two shotguns and an AR-15
semiautomatic assault rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot stuff. Little wonder reporters in Washington were trading
gossip like schoolgirls on the day Homecoming Court is selected,
and Clinton-bashers were chortling over the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man ain't it great!'' began one post on the Internet. ``The
great icon of you puke lefties is busted for putting his family and
neighbors in jeopardy for shooting up his house.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of stations subscribing to the American Family Radio
Network broadcast the news, giving it more momentum. (American
Family Radio is a branch of the American Family Association, the
rightwing organization headed by the activist Rev. Donald Wildmon.)
Surely it would be only a matter of time before the major
newspapers and the networks picked up on the story, staking out the
Carville-Matalin household and shouting questions at them the
moment they surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Only that never happened _ because the incident itself never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing was a hoax, which intrepid reporters soon found
out as they tried to follow up on the story in the Montgomery
County Ledger, a non-existent newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   As genuine as the article appeared to be _ written in a
professional style, with all the news-gathering elements seemingly
in place _ there were a number of details that could easily be
checked and debunked.
</P>
<P>
   The police lieutenant quoted in the story? No such guy.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer? Not a real person.
</P>
<P>
   A Nexis search of published articles about the Carvilles reveals
they live in Virginia, not Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   There were even clues contained within the bylines on the County
Ledger story. A ``Lee Canular'' was listed as the main reporter,
with an ``Ami DeCour'' receiving credit for contributing to the
piece. Think French, my friends. Un canular is a trap, a con, a
trick played on someone. The name Ami DeCour is very close to ami
de la cour (``friend of the court'') or ami de coeur (``bosom
buddy''). Whoever the hoaxsters were, they were obviously expecting
someone to figure out the game.
</P>
<P>
   The radio stations that broadcast the report issued apologies
and corrections. Matalin's and Carville's lawyers are trying to
find the origins on the rotten prank.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. You'd probably have an easier time locating the end
of a rainbow. As Bill Maher of ``Politically Incorrect'' once said,
the Internet is a bathroom wall, and any anonymous clown can write
anything without taking an ounce of responsibility. Regardless of
what you think about Carville and/or Matalin, to launch such a
nefarious ``joke'' isn't funny, it's sick.
</P>
<P>
   By now even the Internet posters have realized the story isn't
true _ but that hasn't stopped the most paranoid of the
anti-Clintonites from speculating about the true origin of the
tale. They're attributing it to ... James Carville. Something about
Carville hatching the plan to win public sympathy as a ``victim''
of a terrible hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The frightening thing is, people who believe such Machiavellian
garbage have the right to vote, and drive cars, and purchase
firearms. Try to forget that when it's time to go to sleep tonight.

<P>
   When I was in Washington recently, nearly every media person I
talked to was hot on a rumor about that oddest of political odd
couples, serpentine Democratic apologist James Carville and
strident Republican mouthpiece Mary Matalin.
</P>
<P>
   It was an ugly rumor. Details varied depending on who was
telling the story, but the gist of it was that Carville had been
arrested after assaulting Matalin and threatening her life.
</P>
<P>
   The story was growing like a poisonous mushroom on the Internet.
In a newsgroup chat room called alt.gossip.celebrities, there was
this post:
</P>
<P>
   ``Seems that cuddly Clinton defender James `Crazyville' shot up
his house and threatened to kill his wife, Mary Matalin. Perhaps
Monica's ex-boyfriend (Clinton) may someday be his cellmate.''
</P>
<P>
   Attached to the post was a copy of a story from the Montgomery
County (Md.) Ledger:
</P>
<P>
   ``ROCKVILLE, MD _ James Carville, vocal supporter and confidant
of President Bill Clinton, reportedly spent last Monday night in
the Montgomery County Jail after he was arrested on suspicion of
firing a gun into a sofa and repeatedly plunging a knife into a
wall during a fight with his wife in their suburban home there
earlier that evening, according to local police sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carville, an internationally known political consultant and
Democratic Party campaign manager, allegedly twice discharged a
Glock 9-mm. semiautomatic pistol inside the home, damaged a living
room wall with an oversized hunting knife, threatened the life of
his wife, radio talk show host Mary Matalin, and used physical
force against her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rockville police subsequently took him into custody on
suspicion of domestic violence and brandishing a weapon, both
misdemeanors. He was also charged with discharging a firearm in a
negligent manner, a violation which could be prosecuted with a
felony.''
</P>
<P>
   The story went on to say that police confiscated a cache of
weapons from the house, including ``two shotguns and an AR-15
semiautomatic assault rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hot stuff. Little wonder reporters in Washington were trading
gossip like schoolgirls on the day Homecoming Court is selected,
and Clinton-bashers were chortling over the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh man ain't it great!'' began one post on the Internet. ``The
great icon of you puke lefties is busted for putting his family and
neighbors in jeopardy for shooting up his house.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of stations subscribing to the American Family Radio
Network broadcast the news, giving it more momentum. (American
Family Radio is a branch of the American Family Association, the
rightwing organization headed by the activist Rev. Donald Wildmon.)
Surely it would be only a matter of time before the major
newspapers and the networks picked up on the story, staking out the
Carville-Matalin household and shouting questions at them the
moment they surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Only that never happened _ because the incident itself never
happened.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing was a hoax, which intrepid reporters soon found
out as they tried to follow up on the story in the Montgomery
County Ledger, a non-existent newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   As genuine as the article appeared to be _ written in a
professional style, with all the news-gathering elements seemingly
in place _ there were a number of details that could easily be
checked and debunked.
</P>
<P>
   The police lieutenant quoted in the story? No such guy.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer? Not a real person.
</P>
<P>
   A Nexis search of published articles about the Carvilles reveals
they live in Virginia, not Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   There were even clues contained within the bylines on the County
Ledger story. A ``Lee Canular'' was listed as the main reporter,
with an ``Ami DeCour'' receiving credit for contributing to the
piece. Think French, my friends. Un canular is a trap, a con, a
trick played on someone. The name Ami DeCour is very close to ami
de la cour (``friend of the court'') or ami de coeur (``bosom
buddy''). Whoever the hoaxsters were, they were obviously expecting
someone to figure out the game.
</P>
<P>
   The radio stations that broadcast the report issued apologies
and corrections. Matalin's and Carville's lawyers are trying to
find the origins on the rotten prank.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck. You'd probably have an easier time locating the end
of a rainbow. As Bill Maher of ``Politically Incorrect'' once said,
the Internet is a bathroom wall, and any anonymous clown can write
anything without taking an ounce of responsibility. Regardless of
what you think about Carville and/or Matalin, to launch such a
nefarious ``joke'' isn't funny, it's sick.
</P>
<P>
   By now even the Internet posters have realized the story isn't
true _ but that hasn't stopped the most paranoid of the
anti-Clintonites from speculating about the true origin of the
tale. They're attributing it to ... James Carville. Something about
Carville hatching the plan to win public sympathy as a ``victim''
of a terrible hoax.
</P>
<P>
   The frightening thing is, people who believe such Machiavellian
garbage have the right to vote, and drive cars, and purchase
firearms. Try to forget that when it's time to go to sleep tonight.

NEWS OF THE GREAT WHITE WAY

 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Great Britain)  (mk) 
 By JESSE MCKINLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After months of bickering and faltering negotiations,
officials at the American Theater Wing and the League of American
Theaters and Producers announced late Thursday afternoon that they
had agreed on a five-year deal to jointly produce the Tony Awards.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be televised live on CBS on June 6. Broadway
shows must open by April 28 to be eligible, and nominations will be
announced on May 3.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which runs through 2004, apparently resolves the
acrimonious dispute that began last summer when the league
announced that it would withdraw from the partnership governing the
annual awards after this August.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the wing, which founded the awards in 1947 and owns
the trademark, and the league, which is the co-producer of the
event and handles much of its administrative workload, had been
meeting since then to settle the quarrel, part of which they said
involved the marketing of the awards.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the league, a trade organization, said they
preferred a higher-profile event complete with corporate
sponsorships and promotional packages tying the Tonys to other
promotions the league runs. Officials at the wing, a philanthropy
of theater professionals founded in the 1930s, consider the awards
a showcase for excellence and oppose using them as a promotion
connected to other events.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall reports surfaced that the league was considering
establishing a rival awards show. The feud angered executives at
CBS, which traditionally broadcasts the ceremony, and network
executives asked the groups to settle their disagreements so that
the show could go on.
</P>
<P>
   The show was dealt a blow last month by the departure of Rosie
O'Donnell, who was its host for two years and had been widely
credited for improving the broadcast's long-sagging ratings. Ms.
O'Donnell said she had a scheduling conflict, and no replacement
has been named.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, executives for both organizations were playing
nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are pleased that we have been able to renew our
partnership,'' said Roy Somlyo, president of the wing, and Jed
Bernstein, executive director of the league, in a joint statement.
``We look forward to many successful Tony awards.''
</P>
<P>
   `Wit' Wants to Compete
</P>
<P>
   The producers of ``Wit,'' the acclaimed drama by Margaret Edson,
have asked the administration committee of the Tonys to make the
play eligible for this year's awards.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is that ``Wit'' is playing Off Broadway, at the
499-seat Union Square Theater, and the Tonys recognize work only in
Broadway theaters, which award rules define as houses with 500
seats or more. Still, the rules, which also identify the eligible
theaters, can be remarkably malleable. Last year ``Cabaret,''
playing at the former Club Expo on West 43rd Street, not named in
the rules, was given a special dispensation and won several Tonys.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Wit'' producers argued in a letter sent Thursday to the
administrative committee that the play was eligible for the Tonys
because they had tried to move the show to Broadway and had the
money to do so, but were thwarted by theater owners ``who deemed
the play unsuitable for Broadway solely on the basis of its subject
matter.'' The play deals with an English professor's struggle with
ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ```Wit' would seem to embody the kind of work which Broadway
desperately needs,'' the letter reads, adding that the show's lack
of ``a Broadway zip code seems a paltry reason'' to overlook the
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wit'' joins a long line of shows playing in ineligible houses
whose producers have petitioned the awards committee for
recognition. Despite notable exceptions like ``Cabaret,'' most are
unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Sherman, a spokesman for the Tonys, said, ``The
administration committee will consider any letter and make a
decision according to the Tony rules.'' The committee is likely to
meet later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Voices of Experience
</P>
<P>
   They are old, to be sure, and also little. And ladies?
Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   But don't call Anna Wing, 84, or Gabrielle Blunt, 80, little old
ladies.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wing and Ms. Blunt are the oldest cast members in ``Blue
Heart,'' the program of two short plays by Caryl Churchill at the
Brooklyn Academy of Music. Between them, Ms. Wing and Ms. Blunt
have about 120 years experience on the stage, but for both Britons
this is the first acting turn in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a lovely clear city you have,'' said Ms. Blunt, who had
never visited the United States before. ``I thought it would have
been much more enclosed with skyscrapers.''
</P>
<P>
   Both actresses began their careers in the mid-1930s as repertory
players in Britain. During World War II, Ms. Blunt acted on the
West End and toured for the troops, while Ms. Wing served in the
Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, both have steadily appeared in theaters around
Britain and on film and television. Ms. Wing is also well known for
her four years on the popular British soap opera ``Eastenders.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I never did anything too splendid,'' Ms. Wing said, ``but I
did a lot of work.''
</P>
<P>
   So what has changed since they first started in the business? On
the bad side, both women say television has weakened the desire for
good theater and good acting. And the improvements? Less
exploitation of actors, and more roles for women.
</P>
<P>
   And what has stayed the same?
</P>
<P>
   ``You always feel a beginner in theater,'' Ms. Wing said.
``Except for a few aching legs and that stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the Way
</P>
<P>
   _ Executives from Walt Disney Co. met in New York last weekend
with the director Kenny Leon and the poet Reg Gaines about their
progress on ``Hoopz,'' a musical about the history of the Harlem
Globetrotters. Savion Glover is also involved in the project, which
is tentatively scheduled for an out-of-town tryout early next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ A week after news that Al Pacino would not appear in a planned
run of ``Othello,'' to be produced by Alexander Cohen, the Mark
Taper Forum in Los Angeles announced that Pacino would star in and
direct Eugene O'Neill's ``Hughie'' in June. The five-week run will
be a reprise of a 1996 New York run at Circle in the Square.
</P>
<P>
   _ Frances Sternhagen will appear in the Women's Project's final
show of the season, ``The Exact Center of the Universe,'' opening
in April. John Tillinger, now directing ``Night Must Fall'' on
Broadway, will direct.
</P>
<P>
   _ Beginning on Tuesday, the Ensemble Studio, at 549 W. 52nd St.,
will be presenting ``Going to the River,'' a two-week festival of
plays by African-American women.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Collected Stories,'' with Uta Hagen, has announced a Feb. 28
closing at the Lucille Lortel Theater. And at the Walter Kerr
Theater, the producers of ``Beauty Queen of Leenane'' have settled
a scheduling conflict with ``The Weir,'' the theater's next play,
and will close on March 14.

<P>
   The pyramids of Egypt are considered to be among the Seven
Wonders of the Ancient World. It is said that the Great Pyramid
near Cairo can accommodate the equivalent of ten football fields.
</P>
<P>
   When we think of the tools that may have been used during those
ancient times, one wonders how the seemingly miraculous feats of
pyramid construction were accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   How could the ancient people build such massive structures
without the benefit of modern machinery? What kind of blueprints
did they have to guide them with construction? Whose idea
spearheaded the first construction? What natural resources were
available?
</P>
<P>
   By their insight and foresight, the builders must have seized
every opportunity -- even those that may have appeared to be
obstacles -- and added their faith and creativity to leave such
impressive gifts to the world.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, we, too, can be a part of that building process.
In fact, each new day with its possible obstacles offers
opportunities to create or build that which we desire. Our
ancestors from around the world may have encountered a river, and
built a bridge and a dam; they entered a forest, and built and
warmed their homes; they cleared a field, and planted and harvested
their crops; they tunneled through mountains, and endured possible
extremes of heat and cold; but they moved onward, forward.
</P>
<P>
   We are blessed to live in a time when one who desires to
organize a business and is willing to take the steps necessary for
the project to unfold can experience the freedom and opportunity to
be an entrepreneur. And world progress needs entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a blueprint or guideline to follow, getting started
may not be difficult. The value of a definitive plan is easy to
understand for it can help one to avoid wasting precious moments.
Dedication to the goal and earnest hard work are important values
that can help manifest the dream.
</P>
<P>
   The advice of Harlow Herbert Curtice, an automobile
manufacturer, was to ``do your job better each time. Do it better
than anyone else can do it. Do it better than it needs to be done.
Let no one or anything stand between you and the difficult task. I
know this sounds old-fashioned. It is, but it has built the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatrist W. Beran Wolfe put it this way: ``If you observe a
really happy man, you will find him building a boat, writing a
symphony, educating his son, growing double dahlias, or looking for
dinosaur eggs in the Gobi Desert. He will not be searching for
happiness as if it were a collar button that had rolled under the
radiator, striving for it as the goal itself. He will have become
aware that he is happy in the course of living life twenty-four
crowded hours of each day.''
</P>
<P>
   And isn't ``living life'' an important foundation for building
our dreams? Within you, within the creative genius of your mind,
lies the real land of opportunity. Within you lies the insight, the
foresight, the strength, courage, faith, freedom, and ability to
accept and express your opportunities. From the circumstances
around you, from the situations in which you may find yourself,
from the relationships in which you may be involved, you can be
creative!
</P>
<P>
   Choose carefully and through much thought and prayer that which
you desire. Be sure your desire is worthy of your energy, your
time, your creativity, and can bring a blessing of service to
others. Know what you desire to accomplish; and plan, step by step,
day by day, how you may achieve your goal.
</P>
<P>
   The pyramid builders built upon one stone at a time. They
started at the base of the pyramid and worked their way up. Most
projects involve the same process-one step at a time. We start at
the beginning and work our way to the finish line. If we are open
and receptive, the resources needed can be provided.
</P>
<P>
   A journalist was complaining to the French novelist, essayist,
and playwright Marcel Ayme that the modern world hinders the free
development of the human being. ``I don't agree,'' said Ayme
mildly. ``I consider myself perfectly free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But surely you feel some limits to your freedom,'' the
journalist commented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes,'' replied Ayme, ``from time to time I find myself
terribly limited by the dictionary!''
</P>
<P>
   What is necessary to become an innovator? First, recognize that
you have within you the power to be creative. Next, be willing to
try new experiences, to discover new fields that may offer scope
for developmental activities.
</P>
<P>
   Being open and receptive can teach us much about the world and
help sincere and creative individuals become innovative
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Success-bound people find it important to believe in themselves,
because the frontier exists inside of them. Jesus' teaching
concerning this is found in Luke 17:21, where we are reminded that
``the kingdom of God is not coming with signs to be observed ...
for behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the true frontier that we must explore: our own inner
being, our own divinity.

<P>
   When I got up last Sunday morning to take a shower at the Trapp
Family Lodge in Stowe, Vt., I noticed with some alarm that the
water was tepid, at best. I called the front desk to point this
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you're at the far end of the lodge,'' the clerk cheerily
responded. ``You need to let the water run for at least 10 minutes.
Turn on the tap, too.'' Then she added an important Vermont fact of
life: ``It  &UR; is &LR;  15 below outside.''
</P>
<P>
   That was a matter of dispute. The temperature recorded at the
top of Stowe's Mount Mansfield at 7 a.m. on Sunday was 0. The radio
news was claiming 11 below, and some people in the lodge lobby said
it hit 7 below in their car. Meanwhile, a thermometer outside a
lodge window was recording a balmy 14 above.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever it was, it was cold. Stowe is not for the pampered.
Sometimes Stowe feels as if it is not for ordinary mortals at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man was not meant to ski,'' my husband, Steve, muttered from
inside his parka as we spent 13 excruciating minutes creeping up
the mountain in the Big Spruce chair lift while the wind tore at
our cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   My family and I spent the weekend downhill and cross-country
skiing at one of the iciest and oldest ski resorts in the United
States. We loved it. Certainly we love the subzero war stories we
get to tell. And it wasn't just a frostbite wonderland: Stowe had a
two- to four-foot base of snow covered with packed powder, all of
it sparkling, at least on Sunday, under sunshine and outrageously
blue skies. ``It doesn't look like Vermont,'' observed Ricky, our
sardonic cross-country teacher and guide.
</P>
<P>
   Skiing at Stowe was born in the 1930s, when the Civilian
Conservation Corps cut the first trail down the mountain. By the
1950s, '60s and '70s, Stowe was the undisputed king of East Coast
skiing, a resort for the rich, famous and expert. But by the 1980s,
upstarts like Killington, Sugarloaf and Stratton had moved onto
Stowe's turf. Today, Stowe is scrambling to keep up, with plans for
a 110-room hotel at the foot of Spruce Peak and renovations to the
no-frills base lodges where skiers buy lift tickets and bump into
each other with their trays over lunch.
</P>
<P>
   But the resort still offers some of the toughest skiing in the
East (not that it mattered to me, a wary intermediate) and one of
the most beautiful settings in Vermont. The village of Stowe has a
white-steepled church, an old-fashioned general store and the usual
shops offering maple syrup and cheese. But it feels like authentic
New England, and at 200 years old, it is.
</P>

   Out Mountain Road is the Trapp Family Lodge, a Tyrolean-style
hotel still run by the family that inspired ``The Sound of Music.''
The von Trapps settled in the hills above Stowe in 1942, four years
after fleeing the Nazis in Austria, then built the first
cross-country skiing center in America. Today it is considered one
of the best anywhere. Their sprawling lodge, in the luxury category
at Stowe, is also the accommodation of choice if you have a
9-year-old daughter, as we do, who views ``Do-Re-Mi'' as a sacred
text.
</P>
<P>
   We left Friday afternoon from our home outside New York, where
there was not a snowflake in sight, and arrived six hours later to
knee-deep drifts at the lodge. I was expecting something hokey,
maybe with puppets popping up singing ``The Lonely Goatherd,'' but
the lodge was a lovely expanse of blond wood and potted white
hyacinths, if lacking what old-timers say was the personality of
the original, which burned down in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Our room had painted Austrian-style furniture, two queen-size
beds covered with down comforters and assorted pictures of the
Trapp family, which our daughter, Madeleine, inspected. A door led
outside to a small terrace. Almost right next to it, under a bright
moon, I was startled to see a small family cemetery with the graves
of Baron and Baroness von Trapp, the real people played by
Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews in the 1965 film musical.
Capt. Georg von Trapp died in 1947, Maria in 1987. We did not meet
Johannes von Trapp, their youngest son, born in America in 1939,
who runs the lodge today.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning Steve nursed a sense of dread over breakfast as
he eyed the fit, furry and upscale granola-and-yogurt crowd in the
dining room. We were not exactly a ready-to-attack-the-mountain
family. Steve had not been skiing in 16 years. Neither had I,
unless you count the hour I spent on a slushy bunny slope near
Poughkeepsie the weekend before with my Brownie troop. Madeleine
had been there, too; this weekend would be her second time on skis.
Our 5-year-old son, Teddy, had never skied. Before we were married,
Steve and I had spent a week together at Stowe, sometime in the
early 1980s, but it felt as if that were a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   We drove 15 minutes to Mount Mansfield, the big mountain where
we had skied before; spent 45 minutes in line with a lot of college
students waiting for rental equipment; then realized we needed to
be across the road at Spruce Peak, Stowe's beginner and
intermediate mountain with the ski school and children's program.
There the crowds were thinner, a godsend when it came to stuffing
the children into ski boots in the small rental area. The staff was
friendly and helpful, but skiing, I immediately noticed, had not
gotten cheaper in 16 years. Maybe that's why we hadn't gone back
for so long.
</P>
<P>
   Lift tickets were $52 a day for adults, $32 for children ages 6
to 12, or $136 for our family. A two-and-a-half-hour children's
lesson was $35 a child. One-day ski, boot and pole rental for four
was $92, with a security deposit of $1,200 I left on my credit
card.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not renting a  &UR; boat &LR; ,'' I said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman who took my money was unmoved. ``If it wasn't so
high,'' she said, ``we wouldn't get the equipment back.''
</P>
<P>
   On the slopes, things got off to a rough start. I almost pulled
my arm out of its socket trying to get Teddy up the rope tow, and I
watched as Steve took Madeleine on a very slow descent with a lot
of falls on, unfortunately, a run named Easy Street.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After lunch ($32.70 for hamburgers and whatnot) the day improved
when the children headed off to their lessons, and Steve and I went
to the top of Spruce Peak and had two nice trips down Sterling, an
easy and peaceful intermediate run through the trees. By the end of
the run I was turning better than I ever had, which seemed odd for
a tired old mom like me.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a result, I later figured out, of the relatively new
super-sidecut or shaped skis that are far better at carving out
turns. They came out widely on the market in 1993, and have been
available for the past two years at Stowe's rental shop. Shaped
skis, as anybody who skis knows, are to skiing what oversize
rackets are to tennis. One guidebook calls them ``the sexiest thing
to happen to winter sports since the invention of the bear rug in
front of the fireplace.'' I was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, Madeleine could make it in a graceful
snowplow down Easy Street, and Teddy was working on stopping. We
repaired, satisfied, to dinner at the Trapp Family Lodge, where we
had good Wiener schnitzel and trout and were serenaded by a harpist
playing subtle strains of ``Edelweiss.'' Everybody was in a dead
sleep by 10:30. We awoke the next morning, stiff, to try out
cross-country skiing.
</P>
<P>
   None of us had been before, and the lodge's ski center, a short
walk through the snow from our room, was a world away from the
downhill lodge of the day before. A fire crackled quietly in the
hearth as the serene cross-country instructors, who seemed as if
they had all just had massages, helped us with our boots and skis.
This time lessons and rentals for four was $80; the pass for the
lodge's 60-plus miles of groomed and back-country trails came with
our room.
</P>
<P>
   For the next hour, Steve and I went with Ricky, our instructor,
and two other adults for a lesson in the basics, then a peaceful
trip through the woods. Our children went off for a separate lesson
with Suzanne. The day was gorgeous, and we met back at the ski
center, thrilled. I was hooked on cross-country skiing, too. Teddy,
who took to it instantly, said he liked it better than downhill.
</P>
<P>
   To me, cross-country skiing was like folk music _ gentle and
close to nature. The downhill was like rock-and-roll _ exciting,
risky and seductive.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward we had lunch at the Trapp-run Austrian Tea Room, down
the road from the main lodge, where the bratwurst was good and the
mountain views spectacular. The gift shop offered an array of
things Trapp: mugs, books, stationery and remastered recordings of
the original Trapp Family Singers.
</P>
<P>
   (The group disbanded in 1956 after touring the world from its
base at Stowe, but reassembled briefly in 1959 to record its own
version of the score from ``The Sound of Music,'' then a Broadway
musical with Mary Martin as Maria, on which the film was based.)
</P>
<P>
   That recording, and the shop, struck me as a weird blending of
treacly myth and fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The myth has taken on a reality of its own, and that's
sometimes a little irritating,'' Johannes von Trapp said when I
called him after we returned. ``We've made our peace with it at
this point, but some of us had more trouble with it than others.''
</P>
<P>
   The family has had a complicated relationship with ``The Sound
of Music'' from the beginning: Even before the Broadway musical, in
one of the more famous bad deals in theatrical history, Maria von
Trapp sold the rights to her story for only $9,000 to a German film
company. The American producers of the Broadway show and film, who
included Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II, gave her a small
percentage of the royalties, though they weren't legally required
to, and so the Trapp family did make money on ``The Sound of
Music,'' but not the fortune they might have. More recently, two
factions of the family have gone to court over a financial dispute.
However interesting, none of this has any effect on guests at the
lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the water for my shower did get hot in 10 minutes.
Von Trapp described the cold last weekend as unusual, but like any
Vermonter he did not seem impressed by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've skied in Austria when everybody was complaining and
freezing to death,'' he said, ``and I thought it was a perfectly
normal day.''

<P>
   Angry seas with swells as high as 20 feet pounded the shores of
Washington Thursday in response to gale-force winds associated with
a relatively routine, wet Pacific disturbance. On Friday, another
batch of rain associated with the approach of the leading edge of
mild Pacific air will arrive. Increasing winds from the
south-southwest will average 20 to 35 miles an hour at the coast by
later in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Then, late Friday night, rain will intensify west of the
Cascades as the center of a very large and powerful Pacific low
pressure system heads toward Vancouver Island. Winds will increase
along the Pacific Northwest Coast, with gusts to 90 miles an hour,
possibly higher, on some exposed beaches in Washington and Oregon
by midday Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms will
sprout from the western Gulf States to the middle Mississippi
Valley as a strengthening northward flow of moist air from the Gulf
of Mexico crosses paths with a Pacific cold front advancing east
across the Plains. As the front marches into Texas Friday night, a
line of thunderstorms will erupt across central and eastern
sections of the Lone Star State, with a few storms possibly
approaching severe levels.
</P>
<P>
   An expansive canopy of clear sky will cover much of the Eastern
States as a tandem of high pressure systems govern the region.
Abundant sunshine, in concert with the presence of Pacific air,
will promote high temperatures several degrees above average from
the Southeast States to the eastern Great Lakes to eastern New
England. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Winter Warmth
</P>
<P>
   Each January during the decade of the 1990s has been warmer than
the long-term average in Tuscon, Arizona. Detailed analysis of the
temperature pattern shows that the bulk of the unusual warmth has
occurred at night. Mild nights have become more frequent in Tuscon
in part because of the way the humans have changed the desert. The
buildings of the city retain some of the heat that would otherwise
dissipate quickly after sunset. Also, city nights have been made
more humid by the evaporation of moisture from the extensive
landscaping. Moist air also discourages quick cooling at night.

 &HT;    PRESIDENTS OF ECUADOR AND PERU PLEDGE COOPERATION
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With words of confidence and hope, the presidents
of Ecuador and Peru pledged Thursday to maintain peace and greater
economic cooperation between their nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not trying to get anything from the other. Our task is
a common task,'' said President Jamil Mahuad of Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad and President Alberto Fujimori of Peru are basking in the
glow of an historic
</P>
<P>
   peace treaty signed Oct. 26 in Brazil, ending more than 150
years of hostilities between the two neighboring South American
countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lasted longer than the Inca's empire,'' Mahuad said of the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The peace agreement delineates the border in a 48-mile section
of the Andean foothills. Peru and Ecuador both claimed the area,
which was left undefined after a 1941 border war. The two countries
fought over the strip of land in 1981 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At a joint press conference at the National Press Club, the
presidents said they were on a quest for $3 billion in aid to build
roads, develop business relations, improve security and promote
tourism and trade.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori and Mahuad said they already had obtained commitments
totaling $1 billion from the Inter-American Development Bank and
the Andean Development Corp. and that they hope to obtain an
additional $2 billion from the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, the European Union, Japan and other nations.
</P>
<P>
   The cooperation between Ecuador and Peru reflects a softening of
hostilities in the general public of the two countries, the
presidents said.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, Ecuadorean anger at Peru manifested itself
in anti-Peru T-shirts and offensive trinkets for sale, such as a
Mickey Mouse-type figurine making an obscene gesture, with the
slogan ``Hey Peru!''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori said he has seen a dramatic change in public opinion
and gave as an example his
</P>
<P>
   1991 trip to Quito, the capital of Ecuador. Political advisers
had urged him not to travel to Quito for security reasons but
Fujimori, often unpredictable, decided to go anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The people ``received me with great enthusiasm,'' he said,
adding that he got a bigger crowd than Mahuad ever did _ a comment
that had the entire room laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad responded in kind, ``I'm just waiting to get to Lima.''
</P>
<P>
   The friendly, bilingual banter between the presidents
underscored the new, peace-seeking cooperation between the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Both said they would forgo weapons purchases for their
respective armed forces for the next four years and use the
billions of dollars they would save on development projects.
</P>
<P>
   The projects are desperately needed in Peru, where 70 percent of
its 24 million residents live below poverty, and even more
desperately in Ecuador, where the 1997 per-capita income was only
$1,392, making it one of the poorest countries in South America.
</P>
<P>
   Mahuad and Fujimori are scheduled to meet with President Clinton
Friday.

 (For release Thursday Feb. 11)  
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lights are of the disco-ball variety, reflecting in red and
yellow and green across the rink.
</P>
<P>
   Jewel sings a sultry pop song, its beat bouncing off the
carpeted walls and polished floor.
</P>
<P>
   Each month, my son's elementary school sponsors a skate night at
the local rink, and each time, I accompany him. But on this outing,
I've decided to rent skates myself, in a nostalgic ode to my
seventh- and eighth-grade weekends spent at a Central Florida
roller rink.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 35, the skates feel heavier on my feet.
</P>
<P>
   It has been, I am shocked to think, more than 15 years since
I've been on skates. I haven't forgotten how, but I have gotten
rusty, as evidenced by my wobbling.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of wearing my tightest jeans and a satin shirt that
catches the light, all the rage when I was in middle school, I am
in a blue knit cardigan and slacks. I've brought along the
newspaper to read at the orange plastic tables in the refreshment
area later.
</P>
<P>
   Adam, still getting used to the idea of balancing on eight
slippery wheels, is propelling himself from video game to video
game, learning to skate by default, since I have agreed to supply
him with quarters only if he plays while wearing a pair of skates.
</P>
<P>
   But I have dared to try the floor, after lacing my boot skates
more tightly around my ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Transported by the music and lights to a time when I knew how to
glide, I push off from the wall, trying to find a cushion of space
where I could be relatively insulated. The rink is crowded tonight,
and finding a spot is like merging onto I-75 during rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   I find my pace, trying not to veer into any of my fellow
skaters. I'm suddenly self-conscious, as if wearing a T-shirt that
says ``WARNING: Middle-age mom on skates, use due caution when
passing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, I had forgotten the obstacle course of those who wipe
out ahead of you: tiny beginners, who sprawl without warning, arms
outstretched and legs tangled, and overly confident pre-teens, who
have cut a corner too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Then I see Adam waving me over to the side. ``Can I skate with
you?'' he says, holding out a hand.
</P>
<P>
   I reach for him, but think, how will I keep us both afloat? We
push off and are sucked into a momentum that only knows forward.
</P>
<P>
   Adam staggers and I do a quick sideways step, trying to steady
him. I move us toward the center, where the younger skaters are
congregated. It's good to tame the small circle before spiraling
outward.
</P>
<P>
   We do a few mini-laps, as if slipping around an icy pond, and I
finally pull away my hand and insist that he take a solo orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Adam does far better with both hands free, able to balance and
steady himself instead of leaning awkwardly into me. He makes
steady, determined progress, and is soon skating around the larger
rink, hugging the wall but going faster and faster until he is
almost running on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   I have pulled over to the carpet, and watch for Adam to surface
among dozens of other bobbing boys as they circle past. He wipes
out a few times that I see, and a few times I don't. After one
fall, he emerges holding his head, and I feel a sizable bump. We
decide to call it a night.

awe. Feared him vaguely. Envied him ferociously. Wondered how he
did it. Still, we knew that for all his wealth, influence and
power, McDonald could not legally drink from a water fountain in a
downtown five and dime that was not specifically marked for
``colored.'' But then, he didn't have to or want to. He could have
opened his own five and dime had he been so inclined. He opened a
bank instead. By CECIL JOHNSON. Story has moved in ``k''

A MONUMENT TO A MAN _ AND A PEOPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Come here,'' the obelisk beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   From the dark side of the cemetery it called.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come here. Stop a spell. Remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Svelte, glistening in the rays of the early afternoon sun of an
unseasonably warm winter day, reaching up, shining out, it towered
high above the headstones immediately surrounding it and over many
of the granite spires and memorial boulders across the path on the
white side of the historic Grand Avenue cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come here,'' it called wordlessly, summoning me to visit the
place where lay the whitened bones of a black man I had known only
as the stuff of legend, as the conclusion of an often-repeated
boyhood expression that began, ``If I was as rich as ...''
</P>
<P>
   Now, most little white boys usually finished that clause with
the name of Rockefeller, or that of someone local like Amon Carter
or Sid Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   But most black boys in the Fort Worth-Dallas area finished it
with the name Bill McDonald _ Gooseneck Bill. In their eyes, he was
the man. They held him in awe. Feared him vaguely. Envied him
ferociously. Wondered how he did it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we knew that for all his wealth, influence and power,
McDonald could not legally drink from a water fountain in a
downtown five and dime that was not specifically marked for
``colored.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, he didn't have to or want to. He could have opened his
own five and dime had he been so inclined. He opened a bank
instead.
</P>
<P>
   Located at Ninth and Jones streets, smack dab in the middle of
what once was a pulsating black Fort Worth business district of two
square blocks, it was called Fraternal Bank and Trust.
</P>
<P>
   But that's getting ahead of the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come here,'' said the stone. ``Think about a man who was born
a year and three months after Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender at
Appomattox Court House in Virginia, and what he achieved during his
four-score and four years.''
</P>
<P>
   As I reflected on the unlikely prospect that a son of slaves
might rise to the prominence that McDonald achieved, a brief
documentary of his life unreeled in my mind. I pictured McDonald:
</P>
<P>
   _Growing up (one of 11 children) in a log cabin in College Mound
a few miles from Kaufman, where his father, Lee McDonald, worked as
a blacksmith.
</P>
<P>
   _As a child, working as a house boy for a local rancher and
lawyer, Capt. Z.T. Adams, and as an adolescent working as a court
messenger.
</P>
<P>
   _Attending college in Nashville, Tenn., and getting expelled
just prior to graduation for leading a student strike.
</P>
<P>
   _Returning to Texas, becoming a teacher and principal in several
rural black schools, accumulating farm land, organizing the first
black state fair, and becoming one of the leaders of the Grand
Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons.
</P>
<P>
   _Running the Texas Republican Party between 1896 and 1909.
Although millionaire Col. E.H.R. Green was supposed to be the
state's top Republican, it was his assistant _ dubbed ``Gooseneck''
by a newspaper reporter _ who distributed the patronage jobs in
customs, the post offices, internal revenue and federal agencies to
both whites and blacks.
</P>
<P>
   _Settling permanently in Fort Worth in 1906, buying the Temple
Drug Store and in 1912 opening the Fraternal Bank and Trust, the
first black-run bank in Texas. Fraternal survived the bank runs of
the Depression, although many other Fort Worth banks went under.
</P>
<P>
   _Helping Democrat Miriam ``Ma'' Ferguson defeat Dr. George Butte
in 1924 after it was discovered that the Republican gubernatorial
candidate had ties to the Ku Klux Klan.
</P>
<P>
   _Purchasing and developing land between East Humboldt and East
Terrell streets to provide quality homes for blacks, including his
own mansion.
</P>
<P>
   _Raising money for the construction of the black Masonic Temple
and a YMCA branch for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's imposing obelisk, I reflected, befits a man of his
stature. Still, it occurred to me that McDonald's true monument is
the record of his extraordinary life of accomplishment and
contributions _ an amazing catalog of success achieved against
overwhelming odds.
</P>
<P>
   His life testifies to the abiding truth that a determined
person, given less than half a chance, can achieve anything that he
or she desires sufficiently. And during this year's Black History
Month observance, McDonald's story underscores the fact that
African-Americans individually and collectively have come farther,
in a shorter time, over a rougher road than any other people in the
history of the world.

 &HT;    HUTCHISON LEADING PUSH TO OPEN SENATE TRIAL DELIBERATIONS
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, a former
television reporter, is leading a bipartisan push to suspend the
Senate's century-old secrecy rule and open the final deliberations
in the Senate impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``The plain fact is that the public's ability to scrutinize its
government's actions have improved dramatically since the Senate
last tried a president, and we should accept that reality,''
explained Hutchison, the primary author of a motion to allow public
viewing of the concluding debate.
</P>
<P>
   Under rules established for the 1868 impeachment trial of
President Andrew Johnson, the Senate's ``doors shall be closed for
deliberation.'' It would take a two-thirds vote of approval _ 67 of
100 senators voting _ to change the rules and allow televised
coverage. The vote on Hutchison's motion is likely to take place
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., has expressed reservations,
comparing the concluding Senate impeachment debate to the secret
deliberations of a trial jury. However, support for the motion
seems to be growing, and Lott is said to be reconsidering his
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported Thursday that ``traditionalists''
such as Sens. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, now
favor opening the final deliberations. Both voted against opening
earlier trial debates to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison was joined in her motion by one Democrat, Joe
Lieberman of Connecticut, and Republicans Chuck Hagel of Nebraska,
Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine, and Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania. The group scheduled a news conference for Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman said Thursday evening that the senator was
unavailable to discuss her progress.
</P>
<P>
   But Hutchison, who was a reporter for a Houston television
station in the late 1960s, has argued that a decision as serious as
the fate of a presidency ``should not be made behind closed
doors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a unique and historic event for the United States and
the public has a right to know how we arrived at our decision,''
Hutchison said in a statement explaining why she filed the motion.
</P>
<P>
   However, opponents have countered that opening the deliberations
would alter the tradition of jurors reaching their decision in
private, and could prolong the proceedings by prompting all 100
senators to speak for televised posterity.
</P>
<P>
   In a ``Dear Colleague'' letter to her fellow senators, Hutchison
urged even those who had voted to keep earlier procedural debates
secret to open the final deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open deliberation will give us the opportunity to explain our
decision to the public in a way that the printed record _ if it
ever becomes public _ can never do,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a simple fact of progress that visual images have been
woven into the texture of history, which once relied on only the
printed word,'' explained Hutchison. ``We are making history, and
future generations, as much as our own, deserve to know how we did
so.''

 &QL; 
QUAYLE (Phoenix) - Dan Quayle tries to resurrect his political
career by launching an exploratory campaign committee. What lies
ahead? By MICHAEL MURPHY. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MEXICAN MAFIA (Phoenix) - In a matter-of-fact voice, a former
``lieutenant'' in the Mexican Mafia described how he and another
member twice attempted to kill Arizona prisons director Terry
Stewart and prison guards. His testimony revealed some of the inner
workings and cold-bloodedness of the violent prison gang. Now a
police informant, the witness detailed how several members - with
nicknames like Cool Cat, Ne Ne, Bam Bam and Chino - plotted to kill
Stewart. The plan was to shoot Stewart four times to make sure he
was dead. They each were going to leave four bullets in their guns
``just in case anyone in the restaurant tried to be a hero,'' the
informant testified during a preliminary hearing to determine
whether there is enough evidence to bound three members of the
Mexican Mafia to trial on the charges. By VICTORIA HARKER. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AZNOTES (Phoenix) - Arizonans' views on the impeachment trial of
President Clinton. By JULIE AMPARANO. Story will move in the ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
NOTARO-COLUMN (Phoenix) - You always enter a resale clothing shop
confident that once you place the pile of once-favorite apparel on
the counter, sirens will sound. Bells will go off. The salespeople
will gather around your heap of clothing, emitting gasps of wonder
and small cries. Instead, as the door swung open and I entered the
store, I got the feeling I was a little out of place. I realized I
was the only one in the entire establishment with hair that wasn't
the color of a Teletubbie, and I suddenly felt self-conscious that
none of my facial features were impaled with a skewer the size of a
shish kebab or tire iron. By LAURI NOTARO. Story moved in the ``L''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
AUTO-REVIEW (Phoenix) - Leave it to Subaru, always the individual,
always unique.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the all-wheel-drive champ brings out another niche vehicle
for a previously unknown niche, the Sport Utility Sedan. Or as it
says on the trunk of the jacked-up Legacy, an SUS. The SUS is built
for people who desire the snow-going, dirt-road-running capacities
of the Outback but still want the sleeker look of a sedan. The
thought of a station wagon strikes horror in many who feel
perilously close to domesticity. By BOB GOLFEN. Story moved in
the``L'' category. Embargoed for Saturday, Feb. 6. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RUSHMORE-MOVIE (Undated) - Even among off-beat movies, ``Rushmore''
is off-off-beat, wigging and wagging without need of a different
drummer. That's the sure sign of a cult hit in the making, as
people who love something different fall for ``Rushmore'' and its
anti-antihero, Max Fischer. A poor kid at a rich kid's prep
academy, Max is in danger of flunking out due to his obsessions:
first, the academy; then the school's new teacher, Miss Cross. 4
stars. By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
RUSHMORE-DIRECTOR (Undated) - Director Wes Anderson also has a
potential cult hit in his pocket. The offbeat ``Rushmore'' is about
a prep school nerd who, instead of being ineffectual like most
movie dweebs, has the school wired. Anderson must have Hollywood
wired because he convinced the Disney Studio to put up $10 million
to make a strange movie whose humor is an acquired taste that many
people may never acquire. By BOB FENSTER. Story moved in the ``E''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
CENTRAL-MOVIE In Rio the trains are so overcrowded that young men
get their seats by clambering through the windows before the doors
open. In a train station and a city so packed with life and
poverty, no one will care about the fate of a lost boy and an old
woman. Brazilian film maker Walter Salles cares, and he has made
``Central Station,'' a film as poignant in its search for the heart
of humanity as Akira Kurosawa's ``Ikiru.'' By BOB FENSTER. Story
moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
LESLEYGORE-MUSIC (Phoenix) - It's the party that never seems to
end. At only 16 years old, Lesley Gore recorded the endearingly
bratty ``It's My Party'' (``And I'll cry if I want to! Cry if I
want to! Cry if I want to!,'' the chorus endlessly whines). Gore is
an interesting paradox. She's now a mature, sophisticated New
Yorker who is a regular on the Manhattan cabaret scene, but she's
eternally linked with a song written from a teenager's perspective.
But she won't bash the tune that made her the Britney Spears of her
day. By RANDY CORDOVA. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL;

 &HT;    Spilling secrets: `X-Files' clearing up mysteries
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Be careful what you ask for, X-philes, because you're about to
get it by the boxcarful.
</P>
<P>
   For years, followers of ``The X-Files'' have been panting for
some solid answers as to how the show's fiendishly Byzantine
conspiracy _ a shadowy alliance between evil aliens and some humans
_ actually works.
</P>
<P>
   In a two-parter beginning Sunday and concluding Feb. 14, creator
Chris Carter gives the show's devotees a Valentine's gift, not only
explaining a lot of the show's mythology but exploding it as well,
setting up the remainder of the series (one more season after this
one, in all likelihood) to head off in some new directions.
</P>
<P>
   For once, the promise of real answers is not just another of
Carter's coy teases. The strange thing (in a TV series full of
strange things) is that once you know it all, it may feel like a
bit of a morning-after letdown.
</P>
<P>
   And fans who followed last summer's ``X-Files'' movie and the
ensuing Internet babble already know more than they may think they
know.
</P>
<P>
   Although there's plenty of action (and the death of more than
one of the players in the mythology), the two episodes are, by
necessity, talkier than normal for ``The X-Files,'' with big chunks
of exposition tossed out like meat to the show's hungry fans.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents Mulder (David Duchovny) and Scully (Gillian Anderson)
are basically just along for the ride in this two-parter, as the
central characters are the mysterious Cigarette Smoking Man and his
troubled son, FBI agent Spender, whom Smoking Man is trying to lure
over to the dark side. A smoke-wreathed figure who's been
(literally) in the shadows for the show's five-season run, Smoking
Man finally gets dragged out into the daylight, his past, secrets
and even his name revealed (mostly in the second part).
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Mulder kiddingly refers to the fashion cliche
about the color gray being ``the new black,'' and that throwaway
line could also apply to the twisted morality at work in ``The
X-Files.'' Even bad guys have their reasons, it turns out, and
sometimes the reasons aren't so bad. Black hats are hard to find;
the morally gray is much more fashionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Sunday and Feb. 14 on Fox .
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: The truth is finally here.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT SEEKS RECOVERY WITH NEW VIDEOTAPE
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key Microsoft Corp. executive and the company's
legal antitrust team worked through the night to produce an
undoctored computer test aimed at recovering the software giant's
shattered credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was a 70-minute videotape, filmed in ``real time'' in
the paneled conference room of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell under the
skeptical gaze of government experts.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Senior Vice President James Allchin narrated the tape,
which was completed at 6:30 a.m. Thursday. It was made after U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on Wednesday had told
Allchin, a star Microsoft defense witness, that he found earlier
obvious miscues by the company in this arena ``very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 50-day course of the landmark trial, nearly every move by
the warring parties has been carefully scripted in the courtroom.
But the overnight Allchin tape broke that mold because as he noted
on the stand, ``I'm going to take my life in my hands and hope to
connect.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Allchin was referring to his persistent problem in
dialing to the Internet _ in a bid to fairly test a
government-sponsored ``concept program'' that supposedly scrubbed
Windows 98 of its Internet Explorer browser. But Allchin also had
no way of knowing in advance how his supervised experiment would
turn out.
</P>
<P>
   The installed software patch, devised by Princeton University
professor Edward Felten, did not prevent Allchin from surfing the
Internet. But with the Felten program in place, some Web sites
performed poorly. Moreover, Money 99, a Microsoft financial
services application, crashed on a ``Feltenized'' machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft tests were aimed to demonstrate that Windows 98
and the Internet Explorer browser are inseparable. The government
seeks to show that Microsoft illegally packaged the two in order to
undermine rival Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had purchased six IBM Thinkpad laptop computers,
preloaded with Windows 98, to conduct the test. Only two of the
computers were actually used as Felten and two of his aides looked
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clearly going to be broken until you add a browser,''
David Boies, the government's lead attorney, told Allchin in the
courtroom. ``Anything that requires a browser isn't going to work _
isn't that right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir,'' Allchin replied.
</P>
<P>
   Before undergoing a final cross-examination on the witness
stand, Allchin also said that Microsoft had made no effort to debug
the government's scrubbing program nor to run Netscape's Navigator
browser with the Felten program in place.
</P>
<P>
   The driving issue behind these tests is a potentially legally
lethal charge by the Department of Justice and 19 states that
Microsoft crafted an integrated Windows operating system, which
runs on 90 percent of the world's personal computers, in a bold bid
to undermine rival Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most pivotal exchange in the entire trial to date
came when Boies asked Allchin whether Microsoft decided ``to
include Internet support in Windows in response to Netscape?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Allchin answered. ``The intent was to unify the browsing
experience across different types of transport, if you will, where
the Internet is viewed as transport.... We added it to be able to
communicate and to be able to unify that (experience) for the
consumer....
</P>
<P>
   ``And long before Netscape was created, we were talking about
this. And we had a plan in place that we wanted to achieve that....
It was a technological 'it's obvious' type of decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the trial could rest on whether Jackson believes
Allchin, the Microsoft guru behind all versions of Windows, or
whether he concurs with the government's account of what took
place.

`SHAKER GIFTS, SHAKER GENIUS': SIMPLE BEAUTY DIVINELY INSPIRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Exhibition notes are at end of review.) 
(js) 
 By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Out of all proportion to their tiny numbers, the
Shakers (a k a the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second
Appearing) left an amazing artistic legacy. For sheer simple
elegance, nothing matched the chairs, cupboards, wardrobes, tables,
boxes, baskets and other handcrafts they turned out, works whose
grace and harmony of design is today admired worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Ask a Shaker how it was that he or she made simply beautiful
things and you got a simple answer: the creative spirit was a gift
from God. The Trappist monk and poet Thomas Merton once suggested
that the perfection of a Shaker chair came from the maker's belief
that ``an angel might come and sit on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But these busy utopians had a lot more than handcrafts in mind,
as seen in ``Shaker Gifts, Shaker Genius: The Collections of the
Shaker Museum and Library'' at the Paine Webber Art Gallery. As a
self-isolated sect, they shunned what they called the world's
people, yet they were connected with mainstream America through a
bustling network of commercial enterprises that ranged from the
large-scale growing and marketing of seeds (they were the first to
sell seeds in colored paper packets) to the manufacture of patent
medicines. Driven by spiritual needs, they worked with prodigious
energy to maintain their tightly organized communities.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 400 objects on view _ rocking chairs, oval boxes,
bonnets, cloaks, washstands, woodworking tools, religious
paraphernalia, song sheets, documents, visionary drawings, maps,
historical prints, photographs and even a Shaker fire engine, made
in 1822 _ ``Shaker Gifts, Shaker Genius'' gives an unusually
rounded picture of this beehive sect. Chosen and arranged by Erin
M. Budis, curator of the Shaker Museum and Library in Old Chatham,
N.Y., the exhibits all come from the museum's extensive collection.
</P>
<P>
   The Shaker saga began in Britain in 1747 as an offshoot of a
Quaker revival movement. Its members were originally known as
Shaking Quakers for the dancing, shimmying and shouting that
signaled their religious ecstasy. The movement waxed under the
leadership of Ann Lee, who was raised in a British industrial slum
in and considered herself a female incarnation of Christ's spirit.
To escape what she saw as a corrupt society, she came to America in
1774 with eight followers and two years later founded a ``heaven on
earth'' community at Watervliet, N.Y. A piece of the checked linen
dress she wore on the journey is displayed in the show.
</P>
<P>
   Being a Shaker was no picnic. It meant living communally as
Brothers and Sisters while remaining celibate. (Children in the
communities were usually charitable wards or sent there by parents
with problems.) Shared rooms and other living spaces made for
little privacy. A ``retiring room'' set up in the show presents the
bare essentials: a curtained-off bed, a shared wardrobe chest, a
tripod table with candle, a washstand, a wood-burning stove and a
woven rug. What more did a good Shaker need?
</P>
<P>
   Besides celibacy, core principles of Shaker life were confession
of sin, common property, equality of the sexes and spiritual
revelation. Shakers believed in the dual gender of God; the male
principle was incarnated in Jesus, the female in Mother Ann (who
died in 1784). Communities were organized into groups of 80 or 90
``families,'' each benignly ruled by two elders and two eldresses.
The peaceful, tolerant Shaker movement stayed vibrant in the United
States for nearly a century. At its peak in the 1840s, members
numbered nearly 5,000, living in 18 communities from Maine to
Kentucky. But after 1860, Shakerism began to decline, and today
there are only a half-dozen members, living in the Sabbathday Lake
community in Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Shaker shows, which tend to deal in anonymities,
this one traces the lives of several brothers and sisters,
providing names, faces, biographical descriptions and samples of
their work. One was Sister Emma J. Neale (1847-1943), who lived in
the leading Shaker community at Mount Lebanon, N.Y., established in
1787 and referred to reverently as ``the Mount.'' Brought there
early in life by their parents, Emma and her sister, Sarah, became
part of the ``family'' known as Church.
</P>
<P>
   In 1888 Emma took over the cloak business started by another
sister and built it into an important source of income for the
Church family under the name ``Emma J. Neale &AMP; Company.''
``Company'' meant the sisters who cut and sewed the cloaks, which
came in popular shades of broadcloth, had bonnet hoods and shoulder
capelets, and fell in long, elegant folds. (A number of cloaks are
on view in the show.) Emma had the design trademarked, and promoted
the cloaks through advertising. At the same time she managed
another major business, the production, packaging and distribution
of medicinal herb tonics, including asthma cures, toothache
pellets, laxatives and Wild Cherry Pectoral Syrup.
</P>
<P>
   That familiar Shaker symbol, the ladderback chair, was a
moneymaker, too. A full line of chairs made by the New Lebanon
community could be ordered from a mail-order catalog distributed
nationwide. The catalog included not only conventional seating, but
Shaker rockers, commodes and wheelchairs. Shown here in an
attractive sampling, the chairs _ the only furniture produced by
the Shakers with significant sales to the outside world _ were so
successful that they were widely copied, and so they were
eventually marked with a bright gold Shaker trademark.
</P>
<P>
   Of more religious import, and definitely not for sale, were the
ethereal graphic works known as ``gift drawings,'' said to be the
products of divinely inspired visions. They are evidence of an
intense religious fervor that swept the Shaker communities from
1837 to 1850, and produced a spate of gifts or messages from the
spirits of departed Shakers, particularly Mother Ann. A
particularly beautiful specimen is ``From Mother Ann to Amy Reed,''
made by Sarah Bates at Mount Lebanon in 1848. Neatly arranged
colored emblems and writings fill the sheet: trees, fanciful birds
and flowers, religious symbols and heavenly musical instruments,
framed by a floral border.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, Shaker skills waned as the communities lost members,
particularly men, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Shaker
sisters took to making clothes, food and souvenirs that were sold
in Shaker gift shops and through catalogs. In the 1930s and '40s, a
last gasp of the old Shaker enterprise could be seen in the efforts
of sisters at Canterbury, N.H., who prepared baked beans in a
wood-fired oven, then sold them from a truck whose back panel is on
view in the show.
</P>
<P>
   But the Shaker accomplishments remain as a bright chapter in
American folk history. They liven up even the pompous,
unaccommodating lobby space at Paine Webber that serves as their
gallery.

 &HT;    MEXICO ANNOUNCES NEW DRUG WAR STRATEGY AS KEY U.S. VOTE DRAWS
NEAR
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Just weeks before the annual debate in Washington
over Mexico's role in the drug war, Mexican officials announced
Thursday a new high-tech strategy for cracking down on narcotics
smuggling through that country.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for spending between $400 million and $500
million over the next three years. Much of the money will be for
satellite technology, and new ships and airplanes to intercept drug
smugglers passing through Mexican waters and territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will use the best technology available in the world,'' said
Mexico's Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida. ``This is a total
war on narco-trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   Labastida appeared at a news conference here to announce the
plan with Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo, Secretary of
Defense Enrique Cervantes and Secretary of the Navy Ramon Lorenzo
Franco.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this month, the Clinton Administration must decide
whether to recommend that the U.S. Congress ``certify'' Mexico as a
reliable partner in the international war on drugs. If Mexico is
not re-certified, Congress can withhold U.S. aid and impose trade
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress will have about a month to debate and vote on the
administration's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   The annual certification of America's drug-fighting partners --
which Mexican officials have routinely criticized as abrasive to
relations between the two countries -- was not mentioned at the
news conference.
</P>
<P>
   In previous years, some U.S. lawmakers have cited corruption
among Mexican military, police and political figures as reasons for
not certifying the country as an honest partner in the war on
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, Congress has given approval to Mexico every
year since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 70 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United
States comes through Mexico, which has struggled to contain the
spread of corruption among officials charged with catching
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more scandalous recent revelations of corruption was
in 1997, when --just before a certification vote -- Mexico's drug
czar was arrested and charged with protecting one of the country's
biggest cocaine traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the governor of Quintano Roo, Mario Villanueva, is
reportedly under investigation by Mexican authorities for ties to
traffickers -- a charge he has repeatedly denied.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican and U.S. authorities say the Caribbean coast state of
Quintana Roo has become a prime corridor of drug trafficking in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the new plan Tuesday, Mexican officials stressed
that they will need to develop honest personnel to employ the new
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The selection and training of human resources will be of vital
importance to guarantee the success of this project,'' Cervantes,
chief of Mexico's military, said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which has already been implemented, calls for the
establishment of a central command center that will receive
satellite and radar information from throughout the country. The
command center will alert teams to check on suspicious aircraft or
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico is purchasing dozens of new airplanes, high-speed boats,
helicopters, amphibious landing crafts, as well as mobile X-ray
machines to screen both humans and vehicles.

INTERNET REVIEW: A SEX METAPHOR, BY VICTORIA'S SECRET
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe this is really what sex is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Squinting at a commemorative-stamp-size picture sent through
cyberspace by the much-hyped Victoria's Secret's fashion show
Wednesday night, one could make out a bit of flesh peeking above a
strip of lacy red. Then the image jerkily churned into a smear of
ocher and burgundy: it looked as if a sheet had been pulled out of
a copier too soon.
</P>
<P>
   And of course there was the inimitable sound: an otherworldly
groan slipping into garbled murmurs, then violently erupting with
hints of Carl Orff, house music and nightclub bacchanals gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the glories of Internet broadcasts! So sexual in their
teasing incompleteness, their unpredictable tumescences, their
latex-garbed sound! In a few years, with appropriate advances in
speed and data processing, the Web will provide an experience as
seamlessly Lycra-like as television; it may even replace
television.
</P>
<P>
   But in the meantime, most Internet connections allow only
stuttering moving images to be seen in tiny windows. Thousands of
dollars of silicon and software are proudly used to present
bottled-sounding radio broadcasts, stop-and-start film clips and
even a thumb-size video version of the president's grand jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   It looks as if the Victoria's Secret enterprise has eclipsed all
events that have ever been broadcast exclusively on the Internet.
According to the company that provided access, Broadcast.com, there
were more than 2 million attempts to log on to the show, its
previews and its reruns Wednesday evening, exceeding the audiences
for some television broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   Access was often clogged and transmissions distorted even beyond
low Internet standards, but it hardly mattered. Peering through
that small, smudged window on the computer screen almost made one
feel like Jimmy Stewart gazing across the courtyard with oversize
binoculars in ``Rear Window.''
</P>
<P>
   That may have been part of the point. Maybe the folks at
Victoria's Secret knew precisely what they were doing when they
spent $5 million promoting the live Webcast of their ``Spring
Fashion Show'' at Cipriani's on Wall Street. This mail-order and
mall-staple company spent three years designing its Web site
(www.victoriassecret.com), which comes with sample videos and an
interactive bra salon. The company's $1.5 million Super Bowl
commercial led to a million visits to their Web site within an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Those visitors were more than voyeurs: daily sales doubled or
tripled. Then came the full-page ads for Wednesday's Webcast in
national newspapers, including The New York Times, promising a
high-toned coupling of high tech and high fashion along with a
``seat on the virtual runway.''
</P>
<P>
   There was even a bit of foreplay: pink ribbons were displayed at
the New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday; Stephanie Seymour, one of
the catalog's stars, rang the closing bell. A seat on the exchange,
a seat on the runway, a seat at the computer: money, sex and
technology in happy communion.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-minute clip is now archived and is available for
continuing visits, but why such a fuss in the first place? What was
the appeal of high tech and high fashion when the Web already
offers so much high tech and low fashion? Why turn to barely
visible images of models in white teddies, when G-strings and bras
are so quickly shed on other Web sites?
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is the obvious: we are obsessed with undergarments _
they certainly played fascinating props in the current drama in
Washington _ and the Web, catering to popular taste, is right at
home with such matters. The medium has met the message: delay,
provocation, unpredictability, furtive flickers of something hidden
_ these elements of the Webcast are also part of the appeal of
Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   Gazing at this Webcast was like watching a striptease through a
keyhole, catching glimpses of a fuller world that one squints at,
trying to imagine in fleshy glory. Even the fashion show's camera
work _ jumpy, skewed, jarringly shifting perspective _ never let
the gaze settle too clearly on anything.
</P>
<P>
   This Webcast was, like so much else, media lingerie: teasing
garb for an event one could only dream about. With all its awkward
crudities, it kept a Web audience captivated as people hit the
reload button on their browsers hoping to see through or past or
under or beyond. Sex as partial disclosure: sounds like Victoria's
secret.

   IMPEACH-TRIAL (Washington) _ The Senate moved to bring President
Clinton's impeachment trial to a prompt conclusion, rejecting a
last-ditch request by House prosecutors to summon Monica Lewinsky
for live testimony. Republicans also shrank from a plan to declare
the president guilty without ousting him from office. (Summary from
wires.) By R.W. Apple Jr.

<P>
   IMPEACH-ASSESS (Washington) _ As the Senate began hurtling
toward the end of the impeachment trial, the last major question
before it is whether it will find a way to bridge party differences
and rebuke President Clinton while leaving him in office. But
finding the right words, the right formula and the right timing is
proving elusive. By Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   CATHOLIC-COLLEGES (Undated) _ From Notre Dame to Georgetown,
most Catholic colleges and universities operate as secular
institutions that make only a respectful nod to Catholic traditions
in their mission statement. But now a committee of American
bishops, in response to a Vatican request, has proposed
requirements that would make Catholic colleges and universities
more answerable to the Church _ a move that has alarmed many
Catholic scholars and teachers, who fear their autonomy and
academic freedom are being threatened. By Karen W. Arenson.

who fired 41 shots at him in the lobby of the man's Bronx apartment
building. By Michael Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ANNIVERSARY (Tehran, Iran) _ As Iran marks the 20th
anniversary of its Islamic revolution, there is a widening gap
between Iranians and the defining event of their recent past. More
than half of Iran's 68 million people were born since the events
that toppled a king and stunned the world; millions more can barely
remember them. Among older Iranians, many regard the revolution as
no longer relevant to today's problems. By Douglas Jehl.

   HUSSEIN _ King Hussein of Jordan suffered internal organ failure
Thursday after last-ditch cancer treatment and was due to be flown

   SCREENWRITERS-PAY (Hollywood) _ A group of Hollywood's top
screenwriters have broken through a longstanding financial barrier
by reaching a highly unusual, almost revolutionary, collective
agreement under which Columbia Pictures has agreed to pay them a
portion of the profits of successful movies in addition to their
usual writing fees. By James Sterngold.

DEMOCRATS PUSH RESOLUTION CENSURING CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN and JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two leading Democrats are close to unveiling a
censure resolution that the Senate could vote on prior to a
guilt-or-innocence vote on the articles of impeachment against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York and Dianne Feinstein
of California want to blunt Republican criticism that a censure
resolution is too vague and could be repealed by a future Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, GOP ardor for a harsher ``finding-of-fact''
resolution cooled considerably Thursday amid an avalanche of
Democratic criticism that guaranteed it would not win bipartisan
support.
</P>
<P>
   Such a resolution would put the Senate on record as concluding
that Clinton committed perjury and obstruction of justice in the
Monica Lewinsky affair. By contrast, a censure resolution would
reprimand the president in less specific terms.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have argued that a finding-of-fact resolution would be
an unconstitutional means of voting to convict Clinton without
bearing the responsibility of removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   That resolution is ``perilously close to being dead,'' said Sen.
Pete Domenici, R-N.M., one of its chief supporters. If no
Democratic support surfaces, ``I will not offer it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said the proposal ``is sort of out
there, sort of in nether land.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Thursday were pushing the censure option. ``Our
hope is that we can move to the articles very quickly and then move
to a censure resolution,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle
of South Dakota. ``We've been working on it and I'm very pleased
with our progress in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate unlikely to muster the 67 votes needed to
convict Clinton and remove him for office, Democrats are gambling
that censure will rise as the chief alternative to outright
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan and Feinstein are aligned with a Republican, Sen.
Robert Bennett of Utah. Bennett characterized his collaboration
with the Democrats as ``a work in progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The two Democrats presented a draft of the resolution to a
closed-door meeting of Democratic senators on Thursday. The
Democrats are to likely to consider a final version Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans, however, remain cool to censuring the
president. ``I personally don't believe a lot of people will want
to do it,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think it's sufficient,'' said Sen. Olympia J.
Snowe, R-Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Key sticking points among Republicans over censure have to do
with timing and long-range impact. Sen. Susan Collins of Maine said
Thursday a censure resolution could be repealed by a future
Congress, while the finding-of-fact resolution could not.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said the Democratic censure resolution would address
that concern.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Moynihan-Feinstein plan, the Senate impeachment trial
would be adjourned and a vote on the censure measure would then
take place in a regular Senate legislative session. That would
precede a return to the trial and a final vote on the articles of
impeachment, Moynihan said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Senate votes on censure before the final vote of the
trial, ``there's no ambiguity about what happened there,'' Moynihan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan warned that delaying a vote on censure until after the
vote on the impeachment articles would result in ``endless''
amendments. The effect, he said, would be ``you lose people on both
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if it is voted on prior to a guilt-or-innocence vote, a
censure resolution still could be revoked in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan spokesman Michael Waterman acknowledged that ``we're in
unchartered waters about how you could deconstruct this in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   However, he added, ``the hope is it would be unrevocable because
it's bonded more tightly to the Senate sitting as a court of
impeachment. This is an attempt to say to future Congresses that
this censure resolution is inextricably linked to the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said censure should come after the trial. ``We do things
one at a time here,'' he said. He described support for a censure
resolution is ``still very fluid.''
</P>
<P>
   Moynihan said he was convinced there would be ``no problem''
getting all the Democrats to agree to the censure motion.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle concurred. ``If you voted for censure prior to the time
you voted on the articles themselves, you would be sending a clear
message that ... we weren't exonerating (Clinton's) actions, we
were not finding the president completely without fault here.''

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he thought ``a censure motion has
very strong support on our side and there are some people (in
support of it) on the Republican side.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said the majority of Democrats have
supported the censure proposal from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who vote against conviction feel strongly that his
conduct was wrong and we want to express ourselves on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill., said he didn't know of a single
Democrat who would vote against censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make it clear that the president's personal conduct
brought disrespect to his office,'' Durbin said.

EXPERT CITES `LEVEL OF DESPAIR' IN TEXAS PRISONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An expert on maximum security prisons said
Thursday that Texas' solitary confinement cells are among the most
inhumane he's ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of despair ... was unparalleled in my experience,''
said Professor Craig Haney, chairman of the University of
California-Santa Cruz psychology department, who has studied
high-security prisons for 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent expert witness in court proceedings about prison
conditions, Haney was testifying on behalf of Texas inmates in a
hearing before senior U.S. District Judge William Wayne Justice.
The judge is deciding whether to prolong his longstanding
jurisdiction over the 140,000-inmate Texas Department of Criminal
Justice.
</P>
<P>
   In a December visit to three Texas units, Haney said he saw
inmates smeared with feces; urine puddles in cells and hallways;
and apparently mentally ill inmates screaming and banging their
heads against the wall. Others were sullen and withdrawn, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not subtle diagnostic issues,'' he said. The
isolated inmates were ``in profound distress and pain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was shattering,'' he said of his visits, adding, ``I was
told this was an everyday occurrence.'' He disagreed with a prison
lawyers' assertion that the bizarre behavior he witnessed were
efforts to grab attention.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of hygiene items, reading materials, education and
recreation contribute to the degrading atmosphere, Haney told the
judge. Inmates are kept in their solitary cells for all but five
hours a week, as specified by previous court rulings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many complained the deterioration of hygiene was part of their
overall (psychological) decline,'' Haney said. ``They felt they had
their dignity taken away,'' because the inmates don't have access
to commissary items such as deodorant and are given one roll of
toilet paper a week.
</P>
<P>
   With reading materials restricted to law books and legal papers,
and in-cell televisions not allowed, many solitary-confinement
inmates rely on radios to ``anesthesize themselves,'' Haney said,
describing the level of deprivation he observed as ``rock-bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisons routinely _ and constitutionally _ inflict psychological
damage on inmates, Haney conceded to prison attorneys. But those in
Texas' 8,000 solitary confinement, or ``administrative
segregation'' cells, are subjected to far harsher conditions than
inmates in some of the nation's toughest lockups, including the
federal prison at Marion, Ill., and the California ``super-seg''
prison at Pelican Bay, Haney said.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions in the three cited Texas units _ Estelle, Beto and
Eastham _ ``were as bad or worse than any I've seen,'' said Haney.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony followed that of a medical expert who said an
analysis of 1998 inmate deaths from HIV, cardiac problems and
cancer showed an ``extremely alarming'' incidence of ``poor care''
given to sick inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Catarina Kiefa, an expert in biostatistics and preventative
medicine at the University of Alabama-Birmingham, said ``it would
behoove them to do something very fast about it. It would suggest
there are very profound problems in the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiefa agreed with other experts' analyses that non-physicians
who treat inmates were not adequately supervised. At least two of
the 73 analyzed inmate deaths were preventable, she stated, adding,
``the human body is very resilient. Just because the person didn't
die doesn't mean the care was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   The experts' testimony came in the third week of a four-week
hearing. Justice was asked to reconsider his role in the Ruiz
prison-oversight case by new Attorney General John Cornyn, whose
team of lawyers have attempted to show that the state has made
great strides in complying with Justice's previous rulings to
improve health care, reduce crowding and end ``cruel and unusual''
conditions. Justice has handled the Ruiz prison reform case, which
is based on a class-action lawsuit filed in 1972 by inmate David
Ruiz, for about 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   A new federal law mandates that Justice end his oversight role
unless he deems there are on-going constitutional violations.
Justice's ruling is expected in several weeks.

invention, and for the Saturn Corp. of General Motors, a rather
simple invention is generating a much-needed lift in sales of its
aging car line. After a recent test-drive of a Saturn SC2, I was
not surprised that the new coupe was doing so well. Even with the
third door, which is nearly invisible when the doors are closed,
the car has the sporty look that two-door buyers like. Yet the
third door opens new markets: Most Saturn coupe owners are single,
but the three-door may prove attractive to parents with small
children, who like the look but need more practicality. By Michelle
Krebs.
</P>
<P>
   CAR-SMART-REARDOORS (Undated) _ The third door on the Saturn
coupe is not your father's _ nor your grandfather's suicide door.
The rear-hinged doors became known as suicide doors because
passengers in those pre-safety belt days could open the doors,
which would catch the wind from the moving car making it impossible
to close them while the car was in motion, and risked falling out
of the vehicle. The biggest difference between the suicide doors of
old and the rear-hinged access door on the three-door Saturn coupe
and some extended cab pickups is the rear doors cannot be opened
unless the front door is open. By Michelle Krebs.

ON 20TH ANNIVERSARY, FEW IRANIANS IDENTIFY WITH THE ISLAMIC
REVOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ These are the ``days of dawn,'' the 10 heady days
that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini back home, saw the
collapse of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's regime and are celebrated
this week across Iran in observance of the 20th anniversary of the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, state television has replayed grainy footage of
Ayatollah Khomeini's arrival, as he is escorted step by step down
the stairs of an Air France jet. Again and again, reverent tales
are retold, like a children's story in which the ayatollah was
introduced as ``the good imam who rid Iran of the evil shah.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ingrained lessons of the revolution, a teen-age girl
asked Ayatollah Khomeini's successor in a televised meeting the
other day, ``Why did the Islamic revolution take place?''
</P>
<P>
   The question reflects a widening gap between Iranians and the
defining event of their country's recent past. More than half of
Iran's 68 million people have been born since the events that
toppled a king and stunned the world; millions more are barely old
enough to remember them.
</P>
<P>
   And the young are not the only ones asking questions. The
revolution that put power into the hands of Shiite Muslim clerics
enjoyed broad popular support at the time. But today, disillusioned
by a generation of experience and emboldened by new political
ferment, millions of Iranians from all walks of life now feel cut
adrift, regarding the revolution as no longer relevant to today's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In scores of interviews around Iran in the last two months,
those were sentiments voiced by clerks, cleaners, farmers,
professionals and others in big cities like Tehran and rural areas
in the farmland around the northwestern city of Tabriz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like sheep, following others,'' one of them, Abil, a
60-year-old farmer wearing striped trousers, a plaid jacket and a
shabby black felt hat, recalled angrily of a revolution that he
once backed with enthusiasm. ``Wherever the shepherd led, we
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadiq Zibakallam, a political scientist who frequently delivers
lectures around the country, said he was encountering a similar
sense of confusion. ``One of the most common questions that I come
across is, `Where are we going?''' Zibakallam said. ``That reflects
the anxiety and helplessness that many Iranians are going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Much Iranian discontent was channeled into the election of
Mohammed Khatami, the president who won a landslide victory two
years ago over a candidate supported by the ruling clerical
establishment. Khatami, who has pressed for greater social and
political openness, is seen by some Iranians as someone who might
lead the country into what might be truly called a
post-revolutionary era.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami remains part of that establishment, as signified by
the black clerical turban without which he almost certainly would
not have been elected. And even he has expressed concern that
Iranians might be tempted to turn away from the past and to discard
cornerstones just 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poisonous winds are blowing inside and outside the country,''
Khatami warned in one anniversary address the other day, ``and
enemies are attempting to separate you from the Islamic Revolution
and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not elaborate. But in recent months, Iran has
appeared increasingly troubled, as the murders of dissident writers
were revealed to have been carried out by rogue intelligence
agents, prompting public protests that in turn met with violence
from unpoliced thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though two decades have passed, it is images of the
revolution that still dominate Tehran, where the picture of
Ayatollah Khomeini, who died in 1989, glowers down from countless
buildings and office walls.
</P>
<P>
   And the very structure of the government, headed by a supreme
religious leader, now Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is regarded as
God's representative on earth, is a product of the revolution that
created the world's first Islamic theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Iranian officials readily concede that young Iranians in
particular appear to have little idea of what the revolution was
about and that keeping memories alive is much of what the
anniversary celebration is about.
</P>
<P>
   In the kickoff to a frenzy of nationwide ceremonies, the exact
moment that Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran, on Feb. 1, 1979,
was marked 20 years to the moment later, at 9:33 a.m. on Monday, as
school bells and train whistles were sounded across Iran.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter on the outskirts of the capital later showered
flowers on the graves of thousands of people killed in what the
ayatollah, during 15 years of exile in France, made a popular
cause: toppling the American-backed shah.
</P>
<P>
   The shah's regime finally fell on Feb. 11, 1979, after days of
street battles, and the celebration is to reach its peak that day
in a mass rally and military parade. In the meantime, film, music
and theater festivals are under way, as is an exhibition showcasing
the country's achievements since 1979, under banners like one that
read: ``The 10 days of dawn gave our nation the sweet fruit of
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   To questions about why the revolution took place, Ayatollah
Khamenei and others have pointed to corruption under the shah and
to what they have suggested was Iran's old place as an outpost of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no mention is being made of the darker side of a revolution
that others remember with horror. More than 10,000 people,
including some of Ayatollah Khomeini's own aides, were executed in
a wave of terror that followed his return.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has mention been made of the economy's downward turn in the
years that followed the revolution, in a country where high oil
prices and a much smaller population had created prosperity under
the shah.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Iranians had seemed willing to forgive hardships, on
the grounds that the revolution was not about economics. But in the
conversations around Iran this year, the state of the economy was a
constant theme of the many people who said that on the anniversary
of the revolution, they saw little to celebrate.

   ``It's not only me,'' said Ali, a 37-year-old cleaner, who was
interviewed as he swept the stairs of an apartment complex on a
chilly night in Tehran. ``Everybody gets angry. These clerics don't
know what kind of problems we have. They don't care, so how can
they think of solving it? They don't even know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed, 39, a carpet weaver in northwest Iran, said, ``We
haven't had a good meal in 20 years.'' He works at a loom in the
two-room house he shares with his wife and his elderly parents and
says he can barely provide for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about the revolution,'' he said. ``The problem is
we can't live.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogieh, 55, a mother of five who sat wrapped in a shapeless
chador on the floor of her family home in a nearby village, said,
``We believe in God, but we did not accept Khomeini and his
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents who defended the revolution said they believed its
critics were holding it to the wrong standard. ``I think the most
important change was independence, not being a colony,'' said
Nasser Sarkhan, 29, a member of Iran's volunteer paramilitary
force, who are known as basijis.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who expressed criticism of the government, few
ordinary Iranians would allow their names to be published, saying
that they feared reprisals from security forces. But some said they
would allow their photographs to be published, as long as the name
of their village did not appear in print.
</P>
<P>
   And many spoke with a boldness that is new to Iran in expressing
not only resentment toward the clerics, widely described as aloof
and indifferent, but sometimes, even vague nostalgia for the days
of the shah. ``He was such a gentleman; he stood so straight; he
represented the glory of the country,'' murmured an official on
duty this week at Saadabad in north Tehran, where busloads of
soldiers and schoolchildren were touring the grounds of the shah's
old summer palace.
</P>
<P>
   Such candor, voiced within earshot of a foreign reporter, would
have been unheard of here just a few years ago. But the election of
Khatami has been followed, in newspapers, by an opening of debate
between his supporters and those of his more conservative rivals,
and this seems to have left ordinary Iranians more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, many volunteered their own stories of the
last 20 years, in which the trauma of an eight-year war with Iraq
and the struggle to make a living formed the main chapters, not the
revolution itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning of the revolution, I supported them,'' said
Seifollah, 55, a farmer who grows carrots and turnips, as he sat on
the floor beside his wife, Rogieh. ``But they made promises they
didn't keep.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple showed visitors a family album that included
photographs of their eldest son, now 33, as a soldier during the
war; they said he was forced into service at the age of 18 by
Revolutionary Guards who pounded on their door in the dead of
night.
</P>
<P>
   Among dozens of people interviewed, in three cities and several
villages, only those with direct ties to the government, including
the soldier, a cleric and a merchant who sells government goods,
said they still identified with the revolution.

   NEW YORK _ Fordham bills itself as ``New York City's Jesuit
university.'' But apart from a courtyard statue of Mary and Jesus
and handsome stained-glass windows in a student lounge on its Rose
Hill campus in the Bronx, there are few outward signs of Fordham's
Roman Catholic identity.
</P>
<P>
   Mass is not required. There are no crucifixes in the classrooms.
The faculty of more than 500 includes only 37 Jesuits. And although
the university's president is a Jesuit, the chairman of the board,
the chairwoman of the theology department and the faculty chairman
are not even Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   From Notre Dame to Georgetown, most Catholic colleges and
universities operate similarly _ as secular institutions that make
only a respectful nod to Catholic traditions in their mission
statement.
</P>
<P>
   But a committee of American bishops, in response to a Vatican
request, has proposed requirements that would make Catholic
colleges and universities more answerable to the Church _ a move
that has alarmed many Catholic scholars and teachers, who fear
their autonomy and academic freedom are being threatened.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Washington this week, the Association of
Catholic Colleges and Universities discussed ideas for a
counterproposal that they would present to the committee by May.
The full National Conference of Bishops is expected to vote on the
issue later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the bishops' requirements in particular have caused
concern among educators. One calls for university presidents to be
``faithful Catholics'' and for new presidents to make a profession
of faith and take an oath of fidelity to the church. A second calls
for theology professors, who are now subject to the same criteria
for hiring and promotion as other academic appointees, to be
approved by church officials. The last requirement directs colleges
and universities to fill a majority of the positions on faculties
and boards of trustees with ``faithful Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Catholic educators, these proposals are blind to the
realities of American higher education: They would handicap them in
recruiting faculty members and students and in receiving government
money, and they raise legal concerns on issues like tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will marginalize our institutions,'' said the Rev. Joseph
O'Hare, president of Fordham. ``The proposals are well-intentioned,
but they might have just the opposite effect they are intended to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the Jan. 30 issue of America, the weekly Jesuit
journal of opinion, the Rev. Edward Malloy, president of the
University of Notre Dame, and J. Donald Monan, chancellor of Boston
College, found the proposals ``profoundly detrimental to Catholic
higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier issue, the magazine called them ``unworkable and
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sees the proposals as a threat. The Rev. James
Conn, a dean and professor of canon law at St. Mary's Seminary and
University in Baltimore, said the concepts already exist in the
church's canon law and are entirely appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a whole lot of attention being paid to them,''
he said. ``Now we're saying that they are not going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David O'Connell, president of the Catholic University
of America in Washington, says he does not believe the proposals
will destroy academic freedom or institutional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that the church should clearly be involved in the
institutions that exist under its sponsorship,'' said O'Connell,
whose university is the only national university of the Roman
Catholic Church in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While other college presidents have objected to being required
to make public oaths of allegiance to the church, O'Connell recited
both a profession of faith and an oath of fidelity when he was
installed as president in November. He said he was baffled that
others were surprised by his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profession of faith that I made is the same profession
that is recited by millions of Catholics each Sunday,'' O'Connell
said. ``The oath is a further expression of commitment to church
teaching, something appropriate to my role as president but also
appropriate to my place within the communion of the Catholic
Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Catholic universities around the world are already
under church jurisdiction, those in the United States _ established
by orders like the Jesuits and the Benedictines or by dioceses _
were pulled into a more secular orbit decades ago, partly because
of the need for government funds but also because of the less
religious nature of American culture itself.
</P>
<P>
   The distance widened in the 1960s, spurred by the freer spirit
promoted after the Second Vatican Council was convened and by the
shrinking participation in religious orders, which forced colleges
once run by the clergy to look increasingly to laymen, even
non-Catholics, to fill classrooms and board rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to reverse these trends comes from Pope John Paul
II, who has sought to reassert the church's primacy in many spheres
and to step back from Vatican II. In 1990, after extensive
consultation with higher education officials, the pope spelled out
his vision in a paper entitled Ex Corde Ecclesiae, or ``From the
Heart of the Church,'' where, he said, universities were born. It
acknowledged cultural and legal differences around the world, but
left details to be worked out region by region.
</P>
<P>
   American church and university leaders have tried three times to
spell out specific norms for Catholic colleges and universities. A
first attempt was deemed overly binding. A second draft was
approved by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1995 by
a vote of 224-6. It affirmed respect for church authority but
called for institutional autonomy and academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the Vatican rejected that version and directed the Americans
to develop a more ``juridical'' version that explicitly addressed
the relationships between church officials and colleges. It is that
attempt, fashioned by a panel of five canon law experts and led by
Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, that so alarmed many
university presidents when it was presented to the bishops'
conference in November.
</P>
<P>
   Like other institutions of higher education, the more than 230
Catholic colleges and universities in the United States are
chartered by local government bodies, accredited by peers from
other academic institutions and receive little or no money from the
church. The colleges, which have more than 600,000 students,
express their Catholic identity in a variety of ways; for most,
however, it is a subtle but distinctive theme.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham's health center, for example, does not dispense condoms
or birth control pills or advice on abortions. The university
refused to grant a group of gay and lesbian students club status or
to give them financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, in the Jesuit tradition, the college
emphasizes community service and tries to provide a moral grounding
for its students. All students are required to take two theology
courses, where they discuss concepts like ``what is religion?'' and
look at world religions, including Catholicism _ courses that take
an analytical approach and in which teachers might even differ from
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic university presidents list an array of problems they
would face if the latest proposals were adopted. One is whether
independent trustees would surrender their authority to the church.
Another is that the emphasis on ``faithful Catholics'' could cause
non-Catholics who make financial and academic contributions to the
university to feel like second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want Protestants, Jews, agnostics, Buddhists and
others to think they have no place here,'' said the Rev. William
Leahy, president of Boston College. ``I don't want the message sent
that we only tolerate them, that they'll be second in priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another difficulty is how to determine who is a faithful
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean we inquire into people's private lives?'' asked
O'Hare, Fordham's president. ``That would be very distasteful. And
in today's culture, we would not want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has pledged himself to his Jesuit order, O'Hare
said he was put off by the idea of university presidents being
asked to make a public profession of faith and an oath of fidelity
to the Catholic Church. Asked what he would do, he expressed
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if I were a married man, and my wife said, `We can't
go on this way,''' he said. ``I'd have to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many Catholic universities are already making
changes. Some, like Georgetown University in Washington and St.
Francis College in Brooklyn, are putting crucifixes in classrooms
again. Others, like Fordham, are establishing new institutes and
research initiatives to pursue religious issues. Boston College has
created a ``vice president for university mission and ministry,''
and now orients new faculty members about the college's Jesuit
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   As the colleges seek to redefine their Catholic identity, a
constant concern is the reaction of their students, many of them
non-Catholic. While some may hunger for a stronger church presence,
others are wary, and say they would not attend a Catholic
university if it were subject to the tenets now being proposed by
the bishops' committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened tomorrow,'' said Ryan Brenizer, a junior at
Fordham, ``I would consider transferring.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenizer, a Baptist, said he chose Fordham because of a
full-tuition scholarship and its rigorous _ and nondoctrinaire _
academic program. ``As part of your education, you are supposed to
be able to examine your own values, and risk them,'' he said.

18TH CENTURY FRENCH DRAWINGS: ENLIGHTENMENT AND LUST IN
18TH-CENTURY FRANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Exhibition notes are at end of review.) 
(bl)  
By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Like every historical epoch, the 18th century in
France was, morally speaking, the best and the worst of times. And
its extremes are reflected in its art.
</P>
<P>
   The endless depictions of erotic sport in the era are reminders
of a royal court notorious for lubricity. Louis XV maintained a
rotating harem at Versailles; his trusted mistress, Madame de
Pompadour, helped to keep it stocked. She even had hopes that her
own daughter might catch his roving eye, although her ambitions
were disappointed when the child died at 10.
</P>
<P>
   This was also the century of the Enlightenment, when
intellectual curiosity was an astringent tonic. One sees its
bracing effects in portraits, including those of Madame de
Pompadour. In one after another, wide-awake, self-amused faces
suggest that the human race, or at least a privileged portion of
it, had suddenly ascended a notch or two up the evolutionary
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   All these impressions are borne out in ``Eighteenth Century
French Drawings in New York Collections,'' a show at the
Metropolitan Museum of Art put together by Perrin Stein, of the
museum, and Mary Tavener Holmes, a guest curator. And they are
further illustrated by several smaller exhibitions elsewhere in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   At the Frick Collection, for example, Francois-Hubert Drouais'
renowned portrait of Madame de Pompadour has just settled in on
short-term loan from the National Gallery in London. Berry-Hill
Gallery next door is offering 18th-century French paintings, and
Wildenstein &AMP; Co. down the street has assembled some choice
drawings from the period. Fold in an array of decorative arts on
display at Rosenberg &AMP; Stiebel, and Manhattan is, at the moment, a
French rococo town.
</P>
<P>
   But the Met's show with 100 works from local public and private
collections offers the broadest chronological sweep. It begins
early, with a red-chalk drawing by Claude Gillot depicting satyrs
in a woodland struggling to pull a cart from the mud while their
passenger, a female faun, looks on in slump-shouldered pique.
</P>
<P>
   Gillot, who died in 1722, was a routinier, and the picture, even
with its slapstick brio, is nothing to linger over. But he was
among the very first artists to test out the components of the
style now known as rococo, and its basic formula is here: a
high-precision mix of nature and artifice, theater and everyday
life.
</P>
<P>
   These elements marry unforgettably in the work of Gillot's
younger colleague Antoine Watteau, one of the supreme luminaries of
European art. Watteau seems to have been an adorable man despite,
or maybe because of, his frayed-wire temperament, all sparks and
short-circuits, pushed to the limit by illness. (One gets some
sense of it in Rosalba Carriera's pastel portrait of him in the
Museo Civico in Treviso, Italy, where he has the tensile,
thoroughbred delicacy of a whippet.) The same feeling comes across
in the six Watteau drawings in the Met show.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the earliest is the Rembrandtesque figure of a peasant
woman. Watteau's line doesn't have much sweep yet; it seems jittery
and crabbed, as if his hand had stayed pressed to the page. But his
innovative layering of red and black chalk, eventually to be
augmented by white, is already in place.
</P>
<P>
   His scrupulous copy of a 16th-century Italian landscape is
fascinating evidence of self-education by an artist who worked
outside the academic mainstream. But the really marvelous things
come next: a graceful study of a not-young nude man; another of a
chubby actor's head, and two pages of superb drawings of women.
</P>
<P>
   In one, the artist sketches the same model's head four times,
tilting it this way and that, as if he was mesmerized by her
swept-back hair. In the second, a seated women in a striped gown
turns to one side with a demure but yielding protest; her skirt is
a turbulent froth of white chalk.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing doesn't get better than this, and Watteau, who died at
37, attracted countless imitators intent on recycling the ``fete
galante'' theme he more or less invented, in which lovers in
Arcadian settings play and dream under the shadow of time. Two of
these painters are in the show: Nicolas Lancret, with a pretty but
brittle drawing of a couple perusing a songbook, and Jean-Baptiste
Pater, with a distorted image of a man whose bulky body is topped
by an impossibly tiny, peevish face.
</P>
<P>
   Given the high standard of technical competence in the period,
this figure comes as a bit of shock. It also provides a welcome
break from the acres of fluff turned out by skilled but sparkless
practitioners like Charles-Antoine Coypel (look for his simpering
Tartuffish self-portrait) and Carle Vanloo, court favorites who
forged careers out of flattery and who seem to have been regarded
as a snooze even in their day.
</P>
<P>
   Francois Boucher, purveyor of high-priced erotica par
excellence, makes an uncharacteristically decorous appearance here
with an ``Adoration of the Shepherds.'' But the show snaps to life
with the work of Jean-Baptiste Oudry.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Oudry specialized in hunting scenes like the noisy little
picture of a hyena attacked by dogs seen at the Met, and his royal
male patrons couldn't get enough of them. (Another vivid and
repellent example is a highlight of the Wildenstein show.) But he
also did landscapes, and his drawings of the gardens at Arcueil, a
decaying estate not far from Paris, seem to emerge from an entirely
different sensibility.
</P>
<P>
   Arcueil's parkland attracted many artists. Most concentrated on
its deserted staircases and pavilions; Charles-Joseph Natoire added
people to the scene, as if he couldn't bear the emptiness. But
emptiness was what Oudry loved. In his Arcueil drawings he banished
every living creature and concentrated on light, silence and
vegetation reasserting its power over human design.
</P>
<P>
   This interaction between nature and culture was of equal
importance to French artists of the next generation, among them
Jean-Honore Fragonard. Like his teacher, Boucher, he was a virtuoso
of the stylishly naughty vignette and the ingratiating portrait.
But his best work was inspired by Watteau's expansive, quicksilver
vision of human life as a tragicomedy with the stage lights always
dimming, and of nature as a kind of untamable, vivacious
intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it animates two of his outstanding contributions to
the Met show. In the red-chalk ``Gathering at Woods' Edge,'' trees
unearthly in their immensity roil and seethe against the sky,
overwhelming the specklike figures beneath them. And in the
chalk-and-wash ``View of a Park,'' women with parasols drift
through a scene, vaporous as a Chinese landscape, that seems to be
viewed through a rain-drenched window pane.
</P>
<P>
   Fragonard was ruined, in every sense, by the French Revolution.
The Met exhibit ends with that wrenching historical episode, and
the gathering of work in the final gallery feels confused,
disjointed and conflicted in a peculiarly modern way.
</P>
<P>
   An insipid vignette of an aristocratic musicale, ``Perfect
Harmony'' by Jean-Michel Moreau, hangs near Jean-Baptist Greuze's
depiction of a mad bourgeois housewife assaulting her family. A
luxuriant, cushiony pastel self-portrait by Elisabeth-Louise Vignee
Le Brun, portraitist to Marie Antoinette, rubs shoulders with an
eyewitness sketch of the guillotined head of Robespierre.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that Enlightment-spawned terrorist had met his fate,
the world of the 18th century had irrevocably changed. But anyone
eager to recapture its essence can do so at the Frick, where Madame
de Pompadour holds court these days.
</P>
<P>
   In Drouais' portrait, begun in the year before her death at 42,
she is swathed in ribbons, lace and flowered Chinese silk and,
hedged in by books and furniture, looks like a giant, just-bloomed
florabunda rose.
</P>
<P>
   The walls of her salon are empty of paintings; maybe Drouias was
reluctant to give air time to his competition. But the Frick has
made up for this by surrounding her with artists of her time. Some,
like Boucher and Greuze, were her favorites. Others, like
Jean-Baptiste-Sime Chardin, were not.
</P>
<P>
   Chardin doesn't figure in the Met or the Wildenstein shows. He
is thought to have done little drawing; only a few early examples
survive. But two of his small, exquisite oil paintings immediately
flank the Drouais, and they represent the French 18th-century
spirit at its finest.
</P>
<P>
   One painting is a somber still life of plums, cucumbers, a dark
bottle and a clear glass of water that together suggest a
different, more elemental notion of sustenance than is conveyed by
the high-cultural clutter in Madame de Pompadour's portrait.
</P>
<P>
   The other picture, ``Lady With a Bird Organ,'' depicts a woman,
probably Chardin's wife, playing a kind of harmonium as she glances
over at a canary, which she is encouraging to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, her flowered dress is a simpler version of Madame
de Pompadour's; her chair equally elegant but less thronelike. She
is set deep back into the picture rather than in the foreground.
And rather than generating a halo, as Madame de Pompadour seems to
do, she is touched by natural light from a tall window.
</P>
<P>
   One tends to think of Chardin, along with Watteau and Mozart, as
being beyond his time, his material modesty and emotional
discretion a spiritual advance on a deeply flawed age. But ``good''
and ``bad'' are always hard to sort out. After all, the woman in
his Frick painting and Drouais' Madame de Pompadour share the same
18th-century face: expectant, alert, half-smiling. And behind both,
darkness gathers in a corner. &QL;

BELL ATLANTIC'S OUTLOOK IS BETTER THAN IT SEEMS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   This year is only five weeks old, but by some measures it
already seems that 1999 will not be kind to Bell Atlantic Corp.,
the nation's biggest local phone company.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Bell Atlantic _ which serves 21.5 million households
and more than 2 million businesses from Maine to Virginia _ lost
out in the bidding to acquire Airtouch Communications Inc., one of
the world's top wireless phone companies. Then AT&AMP;T Corp. unveiled
a uniform 10-cents-a-minute communications package aimed at least
partly at Bell Atlantic's existing wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, AT&AMP;T formed a venture to offer local phone service
over cable television lines owned by Time Warner Inc., the main
cable operator in New York City, the heart of Bell Atlantic's
territory. And then, just two days ago, MCI Worldcom Inc. revived
its own plan to offer local service in New York.
</P>
<P>
   So why is there a growing sense in the telecommunications
industry that Bell Atlantic's prospects are looking up these days?
Why have investors bid up Bell Atlantic's stock 11 percent this
year, even as shares of the other Baby Bells have lost value?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that for all of the efforts by others to chip away
at Bell Atlantic's lucrative turf, the company's long-term
strategic picture is finally coming into focus. Bell Atlantic is
poised to become the first Baby Bell given the keys to the $80
billion long-distance kingdom. It is moving fast to become a player
in the market for high-speed data services. And despite the
Airtouch embarrassment, Bell Atlantic still has a strong global
portfolio in the fast-growing wireless business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Atlantic is one of the largest companies in what is
perhaps the premier growth industry in the United States today,''
said Eric Strumingher, a communications analyst for Paine Webber.
``They are navigating through a tough regulatory environment and
they are assembling the tools to compete globally.''
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean much, of course, for the company's everyday
customers, with whom Bell Atlantic still has a reputation for
haughty and indifferent service. At the same time, some big
business customers remain unconvinced that Bell Atlantic can serve
their needs as well as the competition.
</P>
<P>
   And Bell Atlantic faces more competition than any other local
phone company in the nation, especially in New York City, with its
dense population of lucrative business customers.
</P>
<P>
   But for all that, Bell Atlantic can make a strong case that in
the telecommunications game of musical chairs currently under way,
it will be one of the half-dozen or so major players with a seat at
the head table when the regulatory and takeover music stops in a
few years. That group of companies will be serving millions of
wired consumers, most of the richest corporate accounts, and will
be making a vast majority of the communications profits.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic certainly faces some regulatory hurdles,
particularly with its pending $52.9 billion merger with GTE Corp.
Even so, the GTE deal, which would give Bell Atlantic a national
communications network and a big wholesale Internet business, seems
almost sure to eventually go through, if only because Bell Atlantic
was already allowed to acquire Nynex Corp. and SBC Communications
was allowed to acquire Pacific Telesis Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've tried to do over the last year and a half is build
a multi-dimensional business,'' said Bell Atlantic chairman Ivan
Seidenberg. ``As we head into '99 we believe our shareholders will
get the benefits of a company that has a lot of big ideas but is
also executing in the areas we have chosen to focus on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic has been losing ground for a long time. Over the
last few years, its shares consistently underperformed those of the
other big local phone companies. Many communications analysts were
concerned that Bell Atlantic was limited to the slow-growing
Northeast and that it faced intense competition, especially for its
most profitable customers. And they complained that the company's
senior management did not have a clear understanding of how to
reshape their business to take advantage of changes in technology
and regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, that final issue, of management's overall vision,
has been the most damning. But it may be the question that is being
addressed the most quickly. Consider the message Bell Atlantic
delivered to its top 200 managers, who gathered Tuesday for the
first time since Bell Atlantic completed its acquisition of Nynex
18 months ago for a day of briefings by the senior leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The message they heard was that the company's first priority is
completing the GTE merger. That deal would expand Bell Atlantic
geographically and give its data business a big lift.
</P>
<P>
   But just as important as the GTE merger, and potentially far
more vital for consumers, is the question of when, if ever, Bell
Atlantic will get into the long-distance telephone market in New
York state, allowing customers to finally use one company for both
local and long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disadvantaged clearly by our lack of a long-distance
product,'' said Lawrence Babbio, Bell Atlantic's president and
chief operating officer. ``We need to get into the long-distance
business and give consumers a complete package of services.''
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 said that the Bells could
enter the long-distance market in a given state after they
convinced regulators that their networks in that state were open to
potential competitors. Every Bell that has tried to meet that test
has failed.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bells, the question of whether to pursue long-distance
is a tricky one. The question is whether the prospect of taking
billions of dollars in revenue away from AT&AMP;T and the other
long-distance giants is worth making it easier for new companies to
pursue core local phone customers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, regulators at the Federal Communications Commission
have been put in a tough spot. What do they do when, say, BellSouth
insists that its network in South Carolina is wide open to
competition, but there just do not happen to be any actual
competitors there?
</P>
<P>
   New York may provide a way out of the dead end. In January, the
Supreme Court threw open the question of just what parts of its
networks local phone incumbents are required to sell to
competitors. That could lead to months of delay in the introduction
of local competition as the Bells try to make sure they do not give
more than they have to.
</P>
<P>
   But for Bell Atlantic in New York, that question has become
almost academic. Bell Atlantic has already seen many of its most
lucrative business customers, especially in New York City, defect
to upstarts like MFS Communications and Teleport Communications
Group. And every time that happens, it strengthens Bell Atlantic's
case that it should be allowed to sell long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bell Atlantic made a deal with the New York State
Public Service Commission that the commission would support Bell
Atlantic's federal long-distance application if Bell Atlantic
passed a test of its network designed by KPMG, the consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The test is mainly designed to determine if Bell Atlantic's
computers can accurately and promptly switch customers to other
local phone providers. While KPMG has not yet ramped up the test to
full blast _ about 15,000 orders a day _ executives close to the
process said that critical test could be over within the next 10 to
15 days.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic would then have to fix problems in its billing
systems, to make them compatible with those of other companies, the
executives said. But Bell Atlantic could be ready to file its
long-distance application with the FCC by the end of next month.
And the FCC would find itself under tremendous political pressure
to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   If Bell Atlantic's New York application succeeds, the company
would suddenly be able to offer a package of consumer services to
rival anything available from AT&AMP;T, the leader in bundling
communications services for residential consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And that would only bolster signs that its long-criticized
customer service in New York was improving. ``The company has made
some very substantial improvements over the last three years,''
said Maureen Helmer, chairwoman of the New York State Public
Service Commission. Ms. Helmer said she expected service in New
York state to reach the level Bell Atlantic provides in its other
markets by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And Bell Atlantic might even have a lead in offering high-speed
Internet service. Last month, the company struck a deal with
America Online to market their services together, and by the end of
this year Bell Atlantic plans to offer high-speed cyberspace access
to as many as 5 million homes.
</P>
<P>
   But while it might be nice for consumers to be able to use a
single provider for both long-distance and local phone service, the
big goal for Bell Atlantic is to be able to pursue the big-ticket
corporate accounts, the ones that now rely on companies like AT&AMP;T
and MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   While plain long-distance telephone service is a low-margin
business, there are still rich profits to be won in offering
advanced long-distance data services of the sort used by big
corporations. And there are a lot of big corporations in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going head-to-head with people like AT&AMP;T, British Telecom, MCI
Worldcom for global business services is something that we're also
going to be able to do real well,'' said James Cullen, who is also
Bell Atlantic's president and chief operating officer. ``And that
needs to be done with scale and scope.''
</P>
<P>
   It will not be that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the consumer market is concerned, AT&AMP;T and Bell
Atlantic will be duking it out,'' Strumingher, the Paine Webber
analyst, said. ``But in the business market it is a whole different
story. The regulatory process is only the beginning of the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only will Bell Atlantic have to fight the competition, it
will also have to fight its own traditional culture. Big business
customers these days do not want to buy communications products by
themselves. They want solutions, hand-holding and a consultative
partner. And Bell Atlantic has a long way to go in that department.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bell Atlantic comes in, it's some account manager,'' said
the chief technology officer at a large New York-based financial
institution, on condition of anonymity. ``It's a classic
product-based discussion. I just don't think they're comfortable
saying, `Let's talk about where you're business is going and here's
how we can help you meet your goals.'''
</P>
<P>
   The executive continued, explaining how he had met personally to
discuss such issues with AT&AMP;T chief executive Michael Armstrong and
John Chambers, the chief executive of Cisco Systems, the big maker
of communications equipment. But, he added, ``I don't see Bell
Atlantic's top management.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT SEEKS RECOVERY WITH NEW VIDEOTAPE
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key Microsoft Corp. executive and the company's
legal antitrust team worked through the night to produce an
undoctored computer test aimed at recovering the software giant's
shattered credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was a 70-minute videotape, filmed in ``real time'' in
the paneled conference room of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell under the
skeptical gaze of government experts.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Senior Vice President James Allchin narrated the tape,
which was completed at 6:30 a.m. Thursday. It was made after U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on Wednesday had told
Allchin, a star Microsoft defense witness, that he found earlier
obvious miscues by the company in this arena ``very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 50-day course of the landmark trial, nearly every move by
the warring parties has been carefully scripted in the courtroom.
But the overnight Allchin tape broke that mold because as he noted
on the stand, ``I'm going to take my life in my hands and hope to
connect.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Allchin was referring to his persistent problem in
dialing to the Internet _ in a bid to fairly test a
government-sponsored ``concept program'' that supposedly scrubbed
Windows 98 of its Internet Explorer browser. But Allchin also had
no way of knowing in advance how his supervised experiment would
turn out.
</P>
<P>
   The installed software patch, devised by Princeton University
professor Edward Felten, did not prevent Allchin from surfing the
Internet. But with the Felten program in place, some Web sites
performed poorly. Moreover, Money 99, a Microsoft financial
services application, crashed on a ``Feltenized'' machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft tests were aimed to demonstrate that Windows 98
and the Internet Explorer browser are inseparable. The government
seeks to show that Microsoft illegally packaged the two in order to
undermine rival Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had purchased six IBM Thinkpad laptop computers,
preloaded with Windows 98, to conduct the test. Only two of the
computers were actually used as Felten and two of his aides looked
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clearly going to be broken until you add a browser,''
David Boies, the government's lead attorney, told Allchin in the
courtroom. ``Anything that requires a browser isn't going to work _
isn't that right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir,'' Allchin replied.
</P>
<P>
   Before undergoing a final cross-examination on the witness
stand, Allchin also said that Microsoft had made no effort to debug
the government's scrubbing program nor to run Netscape's Navigator
browser with the Felten program in place.
</P>
<P>
   The driving issue behind these tests is a potentially legally
lethal charge by the Department of Justice and 19 states that
Microsoft crafted an integrated Windows operating system, which
runs on 90 percent of the world's personal computers, in a bold bid
to undermine rival Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most pivotal exchange in the entire trial to date
came when Boies asked Allchin whether Microsoft decided ``to
include Internet support in Windows in response to Netscape?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Allchin answered. ``The intent was to unify the browsing
experience across different types of transport, if you will, where
the Internet is viewed as transport.... We added it to be able to
communicate and to be able to unify that (experience) for the
consumer....
</P>
<P>
   ``And long before Netscape was created, we were talking about
this. And we had a plan in place that we wanted to achieve that....
It was a technological 'it's obvious' type of decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the trial could rest on whether Jackson believes
Allchin, the Microsoft guru behind all versions of Windows, or
whether he concurs with the government's account of what took
place.

MEL GIBSON'S LATEST, `PAYBACK,' IS VIOLENT GARBAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to wonder about Mel Gibson. Here's a guy with proven
artistic aspirations (think of his 1990 ``Hamlet'') and the guts to
direct himself in a project as ambitious and against the grain of
current box-office wisdom as ``Braveheart.''
</P>
<P>
   He has the prestige of a best director Oscar and the star-power
bankability of a Steven Spielberg or Tom Cruise. (He could announce
a plan to film the phone book and a dozen producers would line up
to pay him his regular $20+ million fee.)
</P>
<P>
   So what does he do with all this power and credibility? He uses
it to make a piece of garbage like ``Payback,'' a movie that plays
like a compilation of the worst moments of his ``Lethal Weapon''
series, with the gratuitous brutality jacked up to outdo Quentin
Tarantino on his best day.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is a complete ripoff of the John Boorman classic,
``Point Blank,'' which tells the story of a hood who is shot and
left for dead by his double-crossing wife and his best-friend
partner after a caper, and who comes back from oblivion to settle
the score.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the movie comes off as an unusually violent,
but formula, neo-film noir thriller _ opening with the Gibson
character getting two slugs removed from his back, narrating his
story over a few flashbacks, and then getting hot on the trail of
his junkie wife (Deborah Kara Unger) and sadistic buddy (Gregg
Henry).
</P>
<P>
   Near the middle of the movie _ after beatings, murders and
torture scenes too numerous to mention _ the film suddenly turns
into a goofy comedy, virtually a ``Naked Gun'' version of ``Point
Blank,'' with exaggerated brutality and violence in every scene,
most of it played for crude laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Its two halves are so different in tone that ``Payback'' has the
smell of a film that looked so bad in the rushes that the
filmmakers dramatically changed direction mid-stream, trying to
salvage their sinking ship by turning it into something entirely
different: the single most brutal movie of the '90s _ so brutal
it's hilarious.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gibson and first-time director Brian Helgeland know what
they're doing. Even in this, his most violent and politically
incorrect role to date, Gibson's blue eyes still shine irresistibly
in that increasingly weather-beaten face: he's a charmer. And there
was definitely laughter at the preview.
</P>
<P>
   But it was nervous laughter, uncomfortable laughter, laughter
that said, ``My God, just how far will they go with this thing? How
brutal and sadistic can one movie be?'' For anyone out of junior
high school, ``Payback'' leaves a terrible taste. No major star
vehicle of the '90s has aimed quite this low.
</P>
<P>
   Payback. Directed by Brian Helgeland. Screenplay by Helgeland
and Terry Hayes. Cast: Mel Gibson, Gregg Henry, Maria Bello, James
Coburn (uncredited), Kris Kristofferson. Paramount. 102 minutes.
Rated R for non-stop brutality and violence.

DESPITE STRONG ACTING, `THE GENERAL' LEAVES US COLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   How can a film that boasts a performance as fine as Brendan
Gleeson's be so void of heart?
</P>
<P>
   That was the question after watching John Boorman's ``The
General,'' which won him the best director award last year at the
Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The film, which Boorman also wrote, is based on the life of
Irish gangster Martin Cahill, who was shot to death by an IRA
bullet outside his home in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``The General'' is a throwback to some of the Boorman's earlier
fare, like ``Leo The Last'' and ``Catch Us If You Can,'' which
starred the English band, The Dave Clark Five.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman has had an up-and-down career since then. He scored with
such films ``Deliverance,'' ``Excalibur,'' ``Emerald Forest'' and
``Hope and Glory,'' but also had flops like ``Where The Heart Is,''
which he directed from his late daughter's screenplay, ``Exorcist
II'' and ``I Dreamt I Woke Up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The General'' plays out like a docu-drama, or even a home
movie, as it's shot in black and white and has the grainy,
self-absorbed intimacy of cinema verite.
</P>
<P>
   And it engages on a primal, earthy level because it allows the
little guy to usurp the establishment. But Boorman tries to make
this ``biography'' of Martin Cahill, who eluded capture for 20
years and was called the General by his tight-knit gang of Irish
thieves, into a tale about a very conscience-stricken crisis of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the film is over, we know a lot about this
charismatic thug who plagued the Irish police. For two decades, he
just won't go away, nor can the cops catch him.
</P>
<P>
   He becomes a folk hero to some despite crimes that are from any
image of a noble, Robin Hood-like altruism. Rather, Cahill's
robberies forced employers to lay off their workers because of
there was no money left to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill, played with humorous, ham-hockish and blunt
lack-of-grace by the extraordinary Irish actor, Brendan Gleeson
(Mel Gibson's best friend in ``Braveheart''), is pitted against his
slum-neighborhood Hollyfield mate, police Inspector Ned Kenny (Jon
Voight).
</P>
<P>
   Cahill, locked into the cruelty of the past, is willing to risk
death to make a mockery of the cops and everyone who defies him. He
even marries his childhood sweetheart, Frances (Maria Doyle
Kennedy), and later has children with her younger sister, Tina
(Angeline Ball), in order to snub his nose at convention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this glimpse at the reality of this man who purports to
have values and rules as strict and unyielding as those he fights
against, we can't break into Cahill's heart or pain or anything
else that could help humanize him.
</P>
<P>
   Boorman, who has made emotionally involving work in the past,
seems to have purposefully shied away from feeling here. Like it or
not, ``Beyond Rangoon'' was a moving tale of a stranger in a
strange land. And ``Hope and Glory,'' with its portrayal of
memories of a childhood lived under dire conditions, was teeming
with humor and heart.
</P>
<P>
   Though ``The General'' is a visceral experience as well as a
visual one, it never makes a dent in our feelings. While we admire
its technical prowess _ and Gleeson's amazing performance _ we're
almost relieved when this angry, selfish thug goes down in less
than a blaze of glory.
</P>
<P>
   The General. Directed and written by John Boorman. Cast: Brendan
Gleeson, Adrian Dunbar, Jon Voight, Sean McGinley, Maria Doyle

CISNEROS ARGUES TO GET INDICTMENT CHARGES DISMISSED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JENNIFER DAY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former housing secretary Henry Cisneros argued to a
federal appeals panel Thursday that the judiciary branch has no
jurisdiction to hear charges that he lied to the FBI about payments
to a former mistress.
</P>
<P>
   The former San Antonio mayor was indicted in December 1997 on
charges of misleading the FBI about how much he paid Linda Jones,
formerly Linda Medlar, who was his mistress for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, a federal judge refused to dismiss the 18-count
indictment against Cisneros, which includes charges of conspiracy,
obstruction of justice and making false statements.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Simon, Cisneros' lawyer, told a three-judge panel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals that the courts were violating the separation
of powers doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI background check when Cisneros was being considered for
the Cabinet post was for the president and the Senate only, and
could not be used in a later criminal matter, Simon said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the courts are doing is intruding on something that is
the president's exclusive prerogative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the judiciary has no jurisdiction to determine matters
that are the business of the other branches of government, Simon
said, criminal prosecution should not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But Mathew Rosengart, a lawyer representing independent counsel
David M. Barrett, said arguments on separation of powers were
introduced only to cloud the issues of the case.
</P>
<P>
   He said he can prove that Cisneros lied about payments he made
to Jones and that those lies affected the FBI and Department of
Justice's ability to conduct background investigations of potential
presidential appointees, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the courts were to determine the sole decision-maker is the
president, the implications would be disastrous,'' Rosengart said.
``No one could then be prosecuted for lying to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Cisneros was indicted, the head of the Senate committee
that confirmed him as well as its ranking minority member wrote
letters stating that the amount of money Cisneros paid to Jones was
immaterial to the committee's decision to appoint him HUD
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Rosengart said, though, that misleading information is only
immaterial if it would not have inspired further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Karen LeCraft Henderson, A. Raymond Randolf and David S.
Tatel asked both sides to file 10-page briefs on the topic within
five days.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who was appointed HUD secretary in 1993, resigned from
his Cabinet post in 1996, a year after Attorney General Janet Reno
began an investigation into whether he had misled the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros now heads Univision, a Spanish-language television
network.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is serving a 3{-year prison sentence after pleading guilty
a year ago to 28 counts of conspiracy, bank fraud, money laundering
and obstruction of a special prosecutor's investigation.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT SEEKS RECOVERY WITH NEW VIDEOTAPE
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington queues
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A key Microsoft Corp. executive and the company's
legal antitrust team worked through the night to produce an
undoctored computer test aimed at recovering the software giant's
shattered credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was a 70-minute videotape, filmed in ``real time'' in
the paneled conference room of Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell under the
skeptical gaze of government experts.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Senior Vice President James Allchin narrated the tape,
which was completed at 6:30 a.m. Thursday. It was made after U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson on Wednesday had told
Allchin, a star Microsoft defense witness, that he found earlier
obvious miscues by the company in this arena ``very troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 50-day course of the landmark trial, nearly every move by
the warring parties has been carefully scripted in the courtroom.
But the overnight Allchin tape broke that mold because as he noted
on the stand, ``I'm going to take my life in my hands and hope to
connect.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Allchin was referring to his persistent problem in
dialing to the Internet _ in a bid to fairly test a
government-sponsored ``concept program'' that supposedly scrubbed
Windows 98 of its Internet Explorer browser. But Allchin also had
no way of knowing in advance how his supervised experiment would
turn out.
</P>
<P>
   The installed software patch, devised by Princeton University
professor Edward Felten, did not prevent Allchin from surfing the
Internet. But with the Felten program in place, some Web sites
performed poorly. Moreover, Money 99, a Microsoft financial
services application, crashed on a ``Feltenized'' machine.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft tests were aimed to demonstrate that Windows 98
and the Internet Explorer browser are inseparable. The government
seeks to show that Microsoft illegally packaged the two in order to
undermine rival Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft had purchased six IBM Thinkpad laptop computers,
preloaded with Windows 98, to conduct the test. Only two of the
computers were actually used as Felten and two of his aides looked
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clearly going to be broken until you add a browser,''
David Boies, the government's lead attorney, told Allchin in the
courtroom. ``Anything that requires a browser isn't going to work _
isn't that right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir,'' Allchin replied.
</P>
<P>
   Before undergoing a final cross-examination on the witness
stand, Allchin also said that Microsoft had made no effort to debug
the government's scrubbing program nor to run Netscape's Navigator
browser with the Felten program in place.
</P>
<P>
   The driving issue behind these tests is a potentially legally
lethal charge by the Department of Justice and 19 states that
Microsoft crafted an integrated Windows operating system, which
runs on 90 percent of the world's personal computers, in a bold bid
to undermine rival Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most pivotal exchange in the entire trial to date
came when Boies asked Allchin whether Microsoft decided ``to
include Internet support in Windows in response to Netscape?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' Allchin answered. ``The intent was to unify the browsing
experience across different types of transport, if you will, where
the Internet is viewed as transport.... We added it to be able to
communicate and to be able to unify that (experience) for the
consumer....
</P>
<P>
   ``And long before Netscape was created, we were talking about
this. And we had a plan in place that we wanted to achieve that....
It was a technological 'it's obvious' type of decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the trial could rest on whether Jackson believes
Allchin, the Microsoft guru behind all versions of Windows, or
whether he concurs with the government's account of what took
place.

SENATE, EDGING TOWARD END OF TRIAL, REJECTS LEWINSKY AS WITNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL, JUDY HOLLAND and JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate, singed by public impatience, rejected
an appeal by House Republicans Thursday for former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky to testify at President Clinton's
impeachment trial, clearing the way to end the awkward, year-long
inquiry next week.
</P>
<P>
   Racing through a series of votes with sudden urgency, the
Republican-led Senate slammed the door on potentially embarrassing
personal testimony by Lewinsky that White House lawyers warned
would prolong the trial for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Senate assured some drama to the final days of the
trial by permitting House prosecutors to use videotaped testimony
by Lewinsky, presidential confidante Vernon Jordan and White House
staffer Sidney Blumenthal in their final arguments Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Senators voted against hearing Lewinsky in person 70-30, with 25
of the Senate's 55 Republicans breaking ranks to join all 45
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The vote in favor of admitting videotaped depositions at the
trial was 62-38, with nine Democrats joining 53 Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said the Senate
trial that began Jan. 13 would end no later than next Friday with
Senate votes on the two articles of impeachment lodged against
Clinton by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Lott, acknowledging deepening public antipathy with the
protracted impeachment process, called the Senate action ``a
critical day'' that ``guarantees now that we're moving to the final
phase.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott added:``I do think it's time that we get to a vote and that
we move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Lott and other Republicans rejected for a second
time a Democratic bid to move immediately to final arguments and
votes on the articles of impeachment. The vote was 56-44 against
the Democrats' proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the chamber, as senators were voting on a series of
motions, a man sitting in the tourist section of the gallery
screamed out, ``Good God Almighty, take the vote and get on with
it.'' Capitol police escorted the man out of the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans also defeated a request from Clinton's
lawyers that they receive advance notice about which segments of
the videotaped testimony will be used by House prosecutors in their
summations on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   House prosecutors had already trimmed their request for live
witnesses from seven last week to only three in response to
senators' suggestions that they start cutting back the scope of
their prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish things were different,'' lamented House Judiciary
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., adding that House
prosecutors had to ``live within'' the limitations set by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., a former Los Angeles county judge
serving as one of 13 House prosecutors pressing the case against
Clinton, called Senate rejection of Lewinsky's testimony
``unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood that this was sort of a David and Goliath
approach, particularly in light of the public opinion polls that
don't favor us,'' Rogan said.
</P>
<P>
   The House charged Clinton with perjury and obstruction of
justice in his efforts to hide a sexual dalliance with Lewinsky
from special prosecutor Kenneth Starr and lawyers pressing a
$750,000 civil sexual harassment suit against Clinton filed in 1994
by former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., said that senators had ``come to the
conclusion that we've heard everything from Monica Lewinsky that we
need to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said the rapid fire Senate votes
have helped to ease partisan tensions in the Senate. ``The whole
tone is different,'' Schumer said. ``There's a feeling on both
sides of the aisle (of) let's finish this up.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House expressed immediate relief at the outcome of
Senate proceedings that set the stage for the end of the first
Senate impeachment trial of a president since 1868.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said: ``Today's vote
rejecting the House managers' request for live witnesses indicates
the Senate appears ready to bring this trial to a conclusion.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In rejecting live testimony, Senators turned a deaf ear to
plaintive appeals from the House prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., one of the 13-member team of House
prosecutors, told senators that they had ``a moral obligation to
allow Monica Lewinsky to come here and be judged on her credibility
not just by you, but by the public, by all of us, as a live
witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Edward Bryant, R-Tenn., a former federal prosecutor in
Tennessee who deposed Lewinsky on Monday, said the Senate needed to
hear Lewinsky because she had shaved her testimony during her
deposition to ``the literal truth only.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant said Lewinsky's testimony was ``clearly tinted _ and some
might even say tainted _ by a mixture of her continued admiration
for the president, her desire to protect him, and her own personal
views of right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., responding to senators' request to
bring the trial to a speedy conclusion, conceded, ``we want to have
a final chapter in this national drama.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., appealed to the Senate to permit
Lewinsky to testify because White House lawyers were contesting
facts in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we need witnesses, ladies and gentlemen, to clarify
who said what, who's being honest, who's not, and what really did
happen in this sordid tale,'' Graham said.
</P>
<P>
   White House special counsel Gregory Craig successfully urged the
Senate to reject Lewinsky's live testimony on the Senate floor,
noting that Lewinsky had already testified 23 times under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Admitting Lewinsky ``will be worse than an exercise in
redundancy, it will be an exercise in excess,'' Craig warned. ``It
will only postpone the end of a trial that nobody wants anymore and
no one wants to prolong any longer.''

<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)

</P>
<P>
   Senate efforts to speed the trial to conclusion followed the
apparent loss of support for a GOP effort to cite the president for
wrongdoing as part of the impeachment proceeding without voting to
convict him or remove him from office. Supporters of that effort _
the so-called ``finding of fact'' approach _ were pushing it after
they realized that they don't have the two-thirds majority in the
Senate, or 67 votes, to convict and remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., author
of one of the proposals to cite Clinton for wrongdoing without
removing him from office, said the effort had ebbed because of
Democrats' refusal to join in a bipartisan effort of condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, if no Democrat is going to support it, then I think
that's perilously close to being dead,'' Domenici said. He said he
would not offer his proposal without Democratic support.

AUTO SAFETY: IMPAIRED DRIVING, BY PRESCRIPTION
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION NOTICE: Also filed in category ``a'') 
(bl)  
By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drivers on drugs are involved in thousands of fatal
accidents on American roads each year, according to federal
statistics. Most attention is focused on recreational drugs like
marijuana and cocaine, for which any use is considered abuse. But
new research in Britain shows that in many accidents, the drugs
involved are perfectly legal.
</P>
<P>
   The study, by researchers at the University of Dundee, in
Scotland, examined nearly 20,000 crashes over a three-year period,
from August 1992 to June 1995, cross-checked the drivers against
prescription records and found a very strong link between crashes
and use of tranquilizers.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the compounds they looked at are used in various
prescription and nonprescription drugs, including benzodiazepines,
which are widely prescribed to reduce anxiety. Benzodiazepines
(pronounced ben-zoe-dye-AZ-e-peens) are found in Ativan, Halcion,
Librium, Valium and Xanax. Zopiclone, sold in the United States as
Inovane, a short-acting tranquilizer used as a sleeping pill, was
also cited.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of impairment by prescription is overshadowed by
drunken driving. A Transportation Department study in 1992, of
1,882 drivers killed in traffic accidents, found that 51.6 percent
had alcohol in their blood streams, including 42.6 percent who had
blood-alcohol levels of 0.10 percent or more _ fitting the
definition of drunken driving in most states. The runners-up were
cannabis and cocaine, at 6.7 percent and 5.3 percent; the
top-ranking legal drug was benzodiazepine, at 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People who drink and drive face a drumbeat of warnings and,
sometimes, invervention from friends and family; no such stigma
attaches to prescription drugs, which usually come only with a
warning label affixed by a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, researchers have always wondered whether people
using marijuana or cocaine tend to be involved in crashes because
of the drugs themselves, or because they have risk-taking
personalities; in contrast, people who use tranquilizers are not
believed, as a group, to have the same predilection for risky
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At Hoffman-La Roche, which uses benzodiazapines in Valium and
Librium, as well as several drugs used only in hospitals, spokesman
Martin Hirsch said the company did not have much information on the
study. But he said that the company was already warning people not
to drive while using these drugs, which act on the central nervous
system. He pulled out a package insert and quoted from it: ``As is
true of most preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients
receiving Valium should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous
occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as operating
machinery or driving a motor vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell how many American drivers are involved in
fatal accidents with alcohol in their systems. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration keeps a data base of traffic
accidents, but it reported that of all the drivers involved in
fatal crashes in 1997, 60 percent were not tested for drugs. It was
unclear whether another 18 percent were tested. Of the remainder,
about 15 percent were tested but no drugs were found; for nearly 2
percent, drugs were found but the type was not determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody openly admits we don't test enough drivers in fatal
crashes,'' said Terrance Schiavone, executive director of the
National Commission Against Drunk Driving, an advocacy group based
in Washington. And if investigators test and find alcohol, then
``they're done with testing,'' he said, although alcohol may not be
the only substance in the driver's bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Schiavone said he did not favor any approach that would take the
emphasis off alcohol. A focus on alcohol can help even drug cases;
many of those found to be using drugs had also been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, drivers in fatal crashes who were known to
be tested, and for whom investigators recorded the drug type found,
accounted for fewer than 5 percent of the drivers involved in fatal
accidents. But they may not represent all drug users involved in
accidents. Among those tested, the most popular drugs were
stimulants, followed by cannabinoid (marijuana-like) drugs,
depressants and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   The British researchers found, though, that prescription drugs
were a big problem for the people taking them. Of 19,386 drivers
who had their first accident in the study period, 1,731 were users
of the drugs being studied. People younger than 45 had triple the
risk of being involved in an accident, compared with nonusers; for
people over 45, the risk was about double that for nonusers.
</P>
<P>
   The research, by the Medicines Monitoring Unit of the University
of Dundee, published in October in The Lancet, the prestigious
British medical journal, contrasts with previous research in the
United States that has focused mostly on drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   An October 1992 report by the U.S. Transportation Department
found only limited data that drivers on drugs, legal or illicit,
had an increased chance of causing an accident, and said that when
drugs were combined with alcohol, ``no drug or drug group exhibited
a responsibility rate significantly different from alcohol by
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the federal government enforces drug and
alcohol test rules on more than 9.5 million transportation workers,
of whom 8.5 million hold commercial drivers' licenses. But the
drugs involved are illicit _ like marijuana, methamphetamines and
cocaine. And the Transportation Department pointed out in a 1997
report to Congress that it does not regulate the issuance of
noncommercial licenses; that is done by the states.
</P>
<P>
   The British report said that women were more likely to be using
the prescription drugs, a finding echoed in the United States. A
report by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
in December found that male drivers were overrepresented among
those testing positive for alcohol and for every class of drugs
except benzodiazepines.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that 9 million people, or 5 percent of
drivers, said that in the previous year they had driven within two
hours after drug use; 45 million people, or 27 percent of drivers,
had driven after drinking alcohol. Some people said they had done
both _ not all of them concurrently. &QL;

prescription and nonprescription drugs, including benzodiazepines,
which are widely prescribed to reduce anxiety. Benzodiazepines
(pronounced ben-zoe-dye-AZ-e-peens) are found in Ativan, Halcion,
Librium, Valium and Xanax. Zopiclone, sold in the United States as
Inovane, a short-acting tranquilizer used as a sleeping pill, was
also cited.
</P>
<P>
   The problem of impairment by prescription is overshadowed by
drunken driving. A Transportation Department study in 1992, of
1,882 drivers killed in traffic accidents, found that 51.6 percent
had alcohol in their blood streams, including 42.6 percent who had
blood-alcohol levels of 0.10 percent or more _ fitting the
definition of drunken driving in most states. The runners-up were
cannabis and cocaine, at 6.7 percent and 5.3 percent; the
top-ranking legal drug was benzodiazepine, at 2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   People who drink and drive face a drumbeat of warnings and,
sometimes, invervention from friends and family; no such stigma
attaches to prescription drugs, which usually come only with a
warning label affixed by a pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, researchers have always wondered whether people
using marijuana or cocaine tend to be involved in crashes because
of the drugs themselves, or because they have risk-taking
personalities; in contrast, people who use tranquilizers are not
believed, as a group, to have the same predilection for risky
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   At Hoffman-La Roche, which uses benzodiazapines in Valium and
Librium, as well as several drugs used only in hospitals, spokesman
Martin Hirsch said the company did not have much information on the
study. But he said that the company was already warning people not
to drive while using these drugs, which act on the central nervous
system. He pulled out a package insert and quoted from it: ``As is
true of most preparations containing CNS-acting drugs, patients
receiving Valium should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous
occupations requiring complete mental alertness such as operating
machinery or driving a motor vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell how many American drivers are involved in
fatal accidents with alcohol in their systems. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration keeps a data base of traffic
accidents, but it reported that of all the drivers involved in
fatal crashes in 1997, 60 percent were not tested for drugs. It was
unclear whether another 18 percent were tested. Of the remainder,
about 15 percent were tested but no drugs were found; for nearly 2
percent, drugs were found but the type was not determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody openly admits we don't test enough drivers in fatal
crashes,'' said Terrance Schiavone, executive director of the
National Commission Against Drunk Driving, an advocacy group based
in Washington. And if investigators test and find alcohol, then
``they're done with testing,'' he said, although alcohol may not be
the only substance in the driver's bloodstream.
</P>
<P>
   Schiavone said he did not favor any approach that would take the
emphasis off alcohol. A focus on alcohol can help even drug cases;
many of those found to be using drugs had also been drinking.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, drivers in fatal crashes who were known to
be tested, and for whom investigators recorded the drug type found,
accounted for fewer than 5 percent of the drivers involved in fatal
accidents. But they may not represent all drug users involved in
accidents. Among those tested, the most popular drugs were
stimulants, followed by cannabinoid (marijuana-like) drugs,
depressants and narcotics.
</P>
<P>
   The British researchers found, though, that prescription drugs
were a big problem for the people taking them. Of 19,386 drivers
who had their first accident in the study period, 1,731 were users
of the drugs being studied. People younger than 45 had triple the
risk of being involved in an accident, compared with nonusers; for
people over 45, the risk was about double that for nonusers.
</P>
<P>
   The research, by the Medicines Monitoring Unit of the University
of Dundee, published in October in The Lancet, the prestigious
British medical journal, contrasts with previous research in the
United States that has focused mostly on drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
   An October 1992 report by the U.S. Transportation Department
found only limited data that drivers on drugs, legal or illicit,
had an increased chance of causing an accident, and said that when
drugs were combined with alcohol, ``no drug or drug group exhibited
a responsibility rate significantly different from alcohol by
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the federal government enforces drug and
alcohol test rules on more than 9.5 million transportation workers,
of whom 8.5 million hold commercial drivers' licenses. But the
drugs involved are illicit _ like marijuana, methamphetamines and
cocaine. And the Transportation Department pointed out in a 1997
report to Congress that it does not regulate the issuance of
noncommercial licenses; that is done by the states.
</P>
<P>
   The British report said that women were more likely to be using
the prescription drugs, a finding echoed in the United States. A
report by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
in December found that male drivers were overrepresented among
those testing positive for alcohol and for every class of drugs
except benzodiazepines.
</P>
<P>
   The report also found that 9 million people, or 5 percent of
drivers, said that in the previous year they had driven within two
hours after drug use; 45 million people, or 27 percent of drivers,
had driven after drinking alcohol. Some people said they had done
both _ not all of them concurrently. &QL;

ON 20TH ANNIVERSARY, FEWER IRANIANS IDENTIFY WITH THE ISLAMIC
REVOLUTION
</HEADLINE>

   TEHRAN, Iran _ These are the ``days of dawn,'' the 10 heady days
that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini back home, saw the
collapse of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi's regime and are celebrated
this week across Iran in observance of the 20th anniversary of the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, state television has replayed grainy footage of
Ayatollah Khomeini's arrival, as he is escorted step by step down
the stairs of an Air France jet. Again and again, reverent tales
are retold, like a children's story in which the ayatollah was
introduced as ``the good imam who rid Iran of the evil shah.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ingrained lessons of the revolution, a teen-age girl
asked Ayatollah Khomeini's successor in a televised meeting the
other day, ``Why did the Islamic revolution take place?''
</P>
<P>
   The question reflects a widening gap between Iranians and the
defining event of their country's recent past. More than half of
Iran's 68 million people have been born since the events that
toppled a king and stunned the world; millions more are barely old
enough to remember them.
</P>
<P>
   And the young are not the only ones asking questions. The
revolution that put power into the hands of Shiite Muslim clerics
enjoyed broad popular support at the time. But today, disillusioned
by a generation of experience and emboldened by new political
ferment, millions of Iranians from all walks of life now feel cut
adrift, regarding the revolution as no longer relevant to today's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In scores of interviews around Iran in the last two months,
those were sentiments voiced by clerks, cleaners, farmers,
professionals and others in big cities like Tehran and rural areas
in the farmland around the northwestern city of Tabriz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like sheep, following others,'' one of them, Abil, a
60-year-old farmer wearing striped trousers, a plaid jacket and a
shabby black felt hat, recalled angrily of a revolution that he
once backed with enthusiasm. ``Wherever the shepherd led, we
followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadiq Zibakallam, a political scientist who frequently delivers
lectures around the country, said he was encountering a similar
sense of confusion. ``One of the most common questions that I come
across is, `Where are we going?''' Zibakallam said. ``That reflects
the anxiety and helplessness that many Iranians are going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Much Iranian discontent was channeled into the election of
Mohammed Khatami, the president who won a landslide victory two
years ago over a candidate supported by the ruling clerical
establishment. Khatami, who has pressed for greater social and
political openness, is seen by some Iranians as someone who might
lead the country into what might be truly called a
post-revolutionary era.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami remains part of that establishment, as signified by
the black clerical turban without which he almost certainly would
not have been elected. And even he has expressed concern that
Iranians might be tempted to turn away from the past and to discard
cornerstones just 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poisonous winds are blowing inside and outside the country,''
Khatami warned in one anniversary address the other day, ``and
enemies are attempting to separate you from the Islamic Revolution
and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not elaborate. But in recent months, Iran has
appeared increasingly troubled, as the murders of dissident writers
were revealed to have been carried out by rogue intelligence
agents, prompting public protests that in turn met with violence
from unpoliced thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though two decades have passed, it is images of the
revolution that still dominate Tehran, where the picture of
Ayatollah Khomeini, who died in 1989, glowers down from countless
buildings and office walls.
</P>
<P>
   And the very structure of the government, headed by a supreme
religious leader, now Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is regarded as
God's representative on earth, is a product of the revolution that
created the world's first Islamic theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Iranian officials readily concede that young Iranians in
particular appear to have little idea of what the revolution was
about and that keeping memories alive is much of what the
anniversary celebration is about.
</P>
<P>
   In the kickoff to a frenzy of nationwide ceremonies, the exact
moment that Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran, on Feb. 1, 1979,
was marked 20 years to the moment later, at 9:33 a.m. on Monday, as
school bells and train whistles were sounded across Iran.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter on the outskirts of the capital later showered
flowers on the graves of thousands of people killed in what the
ayatollah, during 15 years of exile in France, made a popular
cause: toppling the American-backed shah.
</P>
<P>
   The shah's regime finally fell on Feb. 11, 1979, after days of
street battles, and the celebration is to reach its peak that day
in a mass rally and military parade. In the meantime, film, music
and theater festivals are under way, as is an exhibition showcasing
the country's achievements since 1979, under banners like one that
read: ``The 10 days of dawn gave our nation the sweet fruit of
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   To questions about why the revolution took place, Ayatollah
Khamenei and others have pointed to corruption under the shah and
to what they have suggested was Iran's old place as an outpost of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no mention is being made of the darker side of a revolution
that others remember with horror. More than 10,000 people,
including some of Ayatollah Khomeini's own aides, were executed in
a wave of terror that followed his return.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has mention been made of the economy's downward turn in the
years that followed the revolution, in a country where high oil
prices and a much smaller population had created prosperity under
the shah.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Iranians had seemed willing to forgive hardships, on
the grounds that the revolution was not about economics. But in the
conversations around Iran this year, the state of the economy was a
constant theme of the many people who said that on the anniversary
of the revolution, they saw little to celebrate.

   ``It's not only me,'' said Ali, a 37-year-old cleaner, who was
interviewed as he swept the stairs of an apartment complex on a
chilly night in Tehran. ``Everybody gets angry. These clerics don't
know what kind of problems we have. They don't care, so how can
they think of solving it? They don't even know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed, 39, a carpet weaver in northwest Iran, said, ``We
haven't had a good meal in 20 years.'' He works at a loom in the
two-room house he shares with his wife and his elderly parents and
says he can barely provide for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about the revolution,'' he said. ``The problem is
we can't live.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogieh, 55, a mother of five who sat wrapped in a shapeless
chador on the floor of her family home in a nearby village, said,
``We believe in God, but we did not accept Khomeini and his
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents who defended the revolution said they believed its
critics were holding it to the wrong standard. ``I think the most
important change was independence, not being a colony,'' said
Nasser Sarkhan, 29, a member of Iran's volunteer paramilitary
force, who are known as basijis.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who expressed criticism of the government, few
ordinary Iranians would allow their names to be published, saying
that they feared reprisals from security forces. But some said they
would allow their photographs to be published, as long as the name
of their village did not appear in print.
</P>
<P>
   And many spoke with a boldness that is new to Iran in expressing
not only resentment toward the clerics, widely described as aloof
and indifferent, but sometimes, even vague nostalgia for the days
of the shah. ``He was such a gentleman; he stood so straight; he
represented the glory of the country,'' murmured an official on
duty this week at Saadabad in north Tehran, where busloads of
soldiers and schoolchildren were touring the grounds of the shah's
old summer palace.
</P>
<P>
   Such candor, voiced within earshot of a foreign reporter, would
have been unheard of here just a few years ago. But the election of
Khatami has been followed, in newspapers, by an opening of debate
between his supporters and those of his more conservative rivals,
and this seems to have left ordinary Iranians more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, many volunteered their own stories of the
last 20 years, in which the trauma of an eight-year war with Iraq
and the struggle to make a living formed the main chapters, not the
revolution itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning of the revolution, I supported them,'' said
Seifollah, 55, a farmer who grows carrots and turnips, as he sat on
the floor beside his wife, Rogieh. ``But they made promises they
didn't keep.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple showed visitors a family album that included
photographs of their eldest son, now 33, as a soldier during the
war; they said he was forced into service at the age of 18 by
Revolutionary Guards who pounded on their door in the dead of
night.

<P>
   Among dozens of people interviewed, in three cities and several
villages, only those with direct ties to the government, including
the soldier, a cleric and a merchant who sells government goods,
said they still identified with the revolution.

MALAYASIA RELAXES SOME CONTROLS ON FOREIGN INVESTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In its first tentative step back into the global
economy, Malaysia announced Thursday that it would relax some of
the sweeping controls on foreign investment that it imposed in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Daim Zainuddin said the government would lift a
12-month moratorium on the withdrawal of foreign capital from the
country. But to prevent an outbreak of capital flight, it
introduced an exit tax that discourages investors from pulling
their money out immediately.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange controls on Malaysia's currency, the ringgit,
remain in force. The currency cannot be traded outside the country,
and its value has been pegged at 3.8 ringgit to the U.S. dollar.
The government will continue to strictly limit the amount of the
currency that residents or visitors can take out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, if Malaysia dug a moat around its economy in September by
imposing capital controls, Thursday's action was the equivalent of
throwing a drawbridge to investors _ at least those with the right
intentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``These new measures are aimed to encourage existing portfolio
investors to take a longer term view of their investments in
Malaysia and to attract new funds into the country, while at the
same time discouraging destabilizing short-term flows,'' Daim said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Fund managers and analysts greeted the announcement, which had
been widely expected, with guarded optimism.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a positive thing and they should be applauded for
it,'' said Mac Overton, a manager at the MBF Unit Trust in Hong
Kong. ``But I'm a little skeptical. What's to keep them from doing
it again if things don't go their way?''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, which had been a magnet for foreign investment, became
a pariah in the world economy when it unexpectedly cordoned off its
currency and capital markets. Most disturbing to investors was the
12-month ban on withdrawing foreign capital. That decision locked
in $3.5 billion to $4 billion in capital held by foreign portfolio
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he wanted to curb sudden
large flows of capital, which he said had destabilized Malaysia's
currency and thrown the country into a recession. Mahathir cited
Western currency traders like George Soros as the primary culprits.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new regulations, investors will be allowed to withdraw
money from Malaysia immediately. But they will be taxed according
to how quickly they act. Those who withdraw capital that had been
in the country for less than seven months will pay a 30 percent
tax. The rate gradually drops to zero for investors who leave their
money in the country for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the government first imposed the controls, everyone was
afraid there would be capital flight after one year,'' said Razak
Baginda, executive director of the Malaysian Strategic Research
Center in Kuala Lumpur. ``This is a mechanism to soften the blow of
that one-year milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the plan had a good chance of working. P.K. Basu,
a senior regional economist with Credit Suisse First Boston in
Singapore, estimated that $500 million to $1 billion in foreign
capital would be taken out of Malaysia in the next two weeks. But
he predicted that it would be more than replaced by fresh capital
from investors who had been avoiding Malaysia because of the
controls.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts are not so sure. Under the new rules, investors
can move money in and out of the country without restrictions,
starting on Feb. 15. But the government will tax investors who
withdraw profits. Like the exit tax, it is intended to penalize
short-term investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sympathetic to a hot-money tax,'' Overton said. ``But it
still seems like the government is going to have control over my
money.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Malaysian officials have been laying the groundwork for these
changes over the last several weeks. Mahathir met with a group of
portfolio managers in Kuala Lumpur two weeks ago to gauge their
sentiment about Malaysia. And he assiduously courted world leaders,
bankers and journalists at the recent World Economic Forum
conference in Davos, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Among the principal arguments Mahathir made is that the controls
had stabilized the economy. By shielding Malaysia from the vagaries
of the global market, the government said, it was able to lower
interest rates and revive commercial activity. Indeed, its central
bank said Thursday that the official forecast of 1 percent economic
growth this year might be exceeded.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Malaysians acknowledge, however, that the controls
hurt the nation's reputation and left it isolated. In part this was
because they were imposed at the same time that Mahathir dismissed
his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim. Anwar is now on trial on corruption
charges; he may take the stand next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a huge misunderstanding about capital controls,''
said Francis Yeoh, one of the nation's business magnates.
``Investors didn't understand that this was supposed to control
currency speculators, not long-term investors.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ Susan Stroman's ``But Not For Me,'' set to Gershwin
for the Martha Graham Dance Company, may be the first work by a
Broadway choreographer for a modern-dance troupe. Usually the
traffic goes in the other direction, with modern-dance
choreographers often working on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons vary. Just plain money is an incentive to try
Broadway, and yet modern-dance choreographers often find Broadway a
good place to experiment. But on the other side of the fence,
modern dance has been loath to invite choreographers from the
commercial theater into its own precincts. The world of concert
dance has, until recently, been defined by a self-proclaimed
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman, it is true, also has choreographed for the New York
City Opera and off-Broadway. Nonetheless, she is the dominant
Broadway choreographer of the 1990s. Among her shows are ``Crazy
For You'' and ``Showboat'' (both of which gained her a Tony Award),
``Steel Pier,'' ``A Christmas Carol'' and the new London production
of ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   If you wonder what Ms. Stroman is doing in the Graham company,
which presented the New York premiere of ``But Not For Me'' at the
Joyce Theater on Wednesday night, the answer is not that complex.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman is enormously talented, which is why she attracted
so much attention so quickly in the first place. Ron Protas,
artistic director of the Graham company since its founder's death
in 1991, invited her to do the third work he has commissioned from
an outside choreographer. The others were Twyla Tharp and Robert
Wilson. Another new work, by Lucinda Childs, will be seen in the
``Duets for Martha'' program next Tuesday at the Joyce Theater.
Graham, it is true, never felt at home with jazz. But to call
George Gershwin a jazz composer is not exactly accurate. Ms.
Stroman's use of Gershwin songs, with the lyrics omitted, focuses
on atmosphere. There is a romantic tinge in the melodies, perfect
for her image of young people in the big city dreaming of happiness
amid the loneliness of the urban crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, she occasionally uses recognizable movements from the
Graham idiom. But she also allows the dancers a contemporary
exuberance. There is some Broadway polish, very different from the
depth of Graham's own fluency. There is also time for glamour, as
Katherine Crockett displays in her knockout performance as the
soloist amid the 10-member ensemble.
</P>
<P>
   The connection between ``But Not For Me'' and the company is
also more formal. The work's world premiere was given in April at
the Library of Congress in Washington. The piece was commissioned
through the Ira and Leonore S. Gershwin Trust at the library. In
1944, the library, through the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge
Foundation, had also commissioned Graham's great ``Appalachian
Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   To see ``Appalachian Spring,'' revived in the Coolidge
Auditorium in April was to relive a part of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Not For Me'' belongs, obviously, to another time and
world. Ms. Stroman has changed and improved the ending, and the
work, if a bit long, succeeds on its own terms. The initial image
of dancers asleep on black pillows may suggest one big pajama
party. But the dreamlike foray into hopes and yearnings adds a
further dimension.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the songs by George and Ira Gershwin were
arranged by Glen Kelly and orchestrated by Doug Besterman. At the
Joyce, Kelly, as pianist, is the sole musician, and he does not shy
away from an overly emphatic beat. The songs include ``But Not For
Me,'' which runs through the piece as well as ``They Can't Take
That Away From Me,'' `` 'S Wonderful,'' ``They All Laughed,''
``Strike Up The Band,'' ``Liza,'' ``Nice Work If You Can Get It''
and ``The Man I Love.'' To her credit, Ms. Stroman does not
illustrate the discarded lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   The overall style suggests a dream ballet with the dancers in
William Ivey Long's khaki pajamas using the pillows as props
(something to hug). Strongly structured, the piece dissolves into
introspective solos and duets, often touched with dejection.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stroman is fond of circles and lifts, but she can also
individualize the performers. Ms. Crockett stands out on her own,
and she always gives the Graham works the sculptural, muscular
depth they deserve. Here she is a modern version of the 1940s
pinup, knee bent and, later, leg extended. She reaches out for the
caress she first gives herself.
</P>
<P>
   The other dancers occasionally do a stylized soft shoe and
wiggle their behinds. Mainly they seem to be enjoying themselves.
At the end, Martin Lofsnes emerges from a pile of pillows and
embraces Ms. Crockett. The lively cast included Theresa Da Silva,
Tadej Brdnik, Sandra Kaufmann, Gary Galbraith, Ariel Bonilla,
Elizabeth Auclair, Virginie Mecene and Daniel Cardoso.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the program, Galbraith was the new minotaur figure
preying upon Therese Capucilli in Graham's 1947 ``Errand into the
Maze,'' set to Gian Carlo Menotti's melodramatic score. ``Errand''
itself is pure drama.
</P>
<P>
   Inspired by Greek mythology, it is a metaphor for conquering
sexual fear and, by extension, all fear. Isamu Noguchi's decor,
forms resonant with sexual meaning, include the wishbone set to
which the heroine retreats after three solos and three encounters
with her beast.
</P>
<P>
   Graham makes her point through the simplicity of her daring and
the expressiveness of her percussive choreography. Galbraith did
well enough for a debut, and his partnering in the highly active
duet with Ms. Capucilli was fine. She, as usual, offered a superb
performance in one of Graham's great works.
</P>
<P>
   The energy level has been low in some of the ensemble pieces so
far but not in ``Sketches from Chronicle,'' a protest piece of
1936. Christine Dakin, wrapping herself in a red shroud and fearful
of the specter of war that she herself represented, was magnificent
in her glaring serenity. The ensemble, striding through the
striking patterns of the second section, leaped with vigor into the
future in the final section.  &QL;

`TILT': SOUNDS AND LITTLE FURIES SIGNIFYING LOTS OF THINGS 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(DW) 
 By D.J.R. BRUCKNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Tilt,'' the Talking Band's latest excursion onto
the stage, is all chamber music, in structure if not in the
whirlwind of words and sounds that sweeps its four characters and
two musicians through a swirl of dreams and illusions.
</P>
<P>
   The impression of chaos is so pervasive that, when the last
scene reveals how neatly constructed this odd little play is, the
revelation comes as a surprise that extorts laughter. One would
have thought Ellen Maddow, who wrote the text and composed the
music, had reached the pinnacle of cleverness with her series of
rhythmic plays a decade ago about the housewife Betty Suffer. But
in ``Tilt'' she outdoes herself; her imagination has been
consorting with Mozart and Haydn.
</P>
<P>
   To begin, two musicians (Ms. Maddow and Joe Roseto) wander in
some confusion onto Christine Jones' ingenious set, which has a
life of its own. After sparring over their roles, they set to work
awakening Flo (Tina Shepard) and Ziggy (Paul Zimet), asleep in
separate apartments. On a shelf in Flo's place are two small
figures, Glo (Zakia Babb) and Mop (Isaac Maddow-Zimet); they may be
icons or simply dolls, but they raid the pantry every time Flo
steps out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Morning rituals _ especially Flo and Ziggy dressing with help
from closets with hands _ make up one of those perky dawn
interludes heard in so many 18th-century symphonies, followed by
the thunder of New York street sounds and a tornado of windblown
paper as the two make their way to an office where they are
partners in a mysterious business.
</P>
<P>
   As they argue through several days over who will handle the
phones and who the mail, or what to order for lunch or what time to
close, variations on themes in language, role reversals and
emotional upheavals spell out the amusing central motifs of this
odd composition.
</P>
<P>
   Ziggy is all order. At home he reads obsessively; calls his
lover or spouse, Margaret, who is away on a trip, to recite
exciting discoveries, such as the second law of thermodynamics, and
sleeps fitfully through musical nightmares. Flo is all intuition:
rosy dawn, rosy day; gray dawn, bleak prospect. Without seeing her
icons move she knows they do. She knows what Ziggy thinks, without
much wanting to.
</P>
<P>
   The story is a good deal more subtle and complex than it appears
to be. That Ms. Maddow and this cast are able to convey so much
meaning with so few words and so little variation in movement is
testimony to the mastery achieved by the Talking Band in its 25
years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the direction of Will Pomerantz, the characters, and the
musicians, who are characters too, move with the economical
precision of unexpectedly emotional puppets capable of an
occasional sly smile that lets the audience know a surprise is in
the offing.
</P>
<P>
   They all share such a smile when one of the score of office
phones rings and Flo and Ziggy find they've won a trip to a sort of
Catskills resort where, in a glittering ballroom, they, and Glo and
Mop, dance. It is the minuet, of course: that spirited little
movement that told the knowing listeners in grand old Viennese
parlors that the transport of delight with which Haydn or Mozart
had carried them away was about to float back to earth.

WWII HERO WALLENBERG MAY GET THAT SPOTLIGHT NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE WILSON  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - He had it all _ a famous name, a family fortune, a
great education, a secure and unlimited future. In 1944, he risked
everything to save Hungarian Jews from Nazi extermination.
</P>
<P>
   He ranks as one of the greatest _ and least known _ heroes of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   A Swedish businessman and diplomat, he volunteered to go to
Budapest, Hungary, where the Nazis were moving to wipe out the last
large European community of Jews. His relentless, courageous
efforts prevented Adolf Eichmann from deporting tens of thousands _
estimates reach as high as 100,000 _ to the death camps.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Raoul Wallenberg. Or should I say ``is'' Raoul
Wallenberg?
</P>
<P>
   During his months in Budapest, he lived in constant danger.
Eichmann called him ``Jewdog Wallenberg'' and ordered his murder.
He survived partly because he slept in a different place every
night.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, his humanitarian efforts were ignored by the
Soviets who thought he was a spy and took him prisoner. While the
Russians said he died many years ago in detention, some people
believe he could still be alive. They include Morris Wolff of
Phoenix, who has spent 15 years researching the life and
disappearance of this extraordinary man.
</P>
<P>
   A Yale law graduate and ex-professor, Wolff moved here a year
ago and worked briefly for the Arizona Corporation Commission. He's
now finishing a book on Wallenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff taught human rights law and was practicing in Philadelphia
when he was asked by Wallenberg's family in Sweden if he could help
them. He filed a federal lawsuit in 1984, alleging the Soviet Union
had violated international law.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C., found the Soviets
liable for violating Wallenberg's human rights, imposed a fine of
$39 million and ordered them to produce him. The ruling was
appealed, however, and set aside for lack of jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The official Soviet line is that he died of a heart attack in a
Moscow prison in 1947. Others speculate that Josef Stalin had
ordered his execution. But freed Soviet prisoners reported
Wallenberg had been seen into the 1980s, and no credible evidence
of his death has been provided.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1981 book ``Righteous Gentile'' _ Wallenberg was a Lutheran
_ John Bierman concluded that he might still be living. He cited
the Soviet tradition of keeping well-known people, from Feodor
Dostoyevsky to Alexander Solzhenitsyn, in confinement for long
periods.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff, whose research draws on both American and Soviet
intelligence reports, is optimistic that Wallenberg survives.
Conversations with two Russian Orthodox priests in 1993 strengthen
his belief. He's hopeful that his book will ``ignite a clamor and
lead the United States to demand an honest accounting of his
life.''
</P>
<P>
   America's efforts on behalf of Wallenberg have been shamefully
slight, especially in light of his U.S. ties. He was an honor
student at the University of Michigan and went to Budapest at the
request of the American War Refugee Board.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cold War's onset, tense Soviet relations apparently
figured into U.S. apathy. Wallenberg's fate wasn't regarded as
important enough to risk stirring up more diplomatic trouble.
</P>
<P>
   A Free Wallenberg Committee was formed in 1980, and for only the
second time in history, Congress granted him honorary U.S.
citizenship (the first honoree was Winston Churchill). But that
campaign and Swedish efforts produced nothing new from the Soviets.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to overstate how much Wallenberg gave up in 1944.
Being a Wallenberg in Sweden is akin to being a Rockefeller in this
country, only bigger. Companies under Wallenberg family control
last year accounted for 40 percent of the Swedish stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Wolff said one reason for writing the book is so more Americans
will know of the sacrifices made by ``one of the most selfless
citizens of the 20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   I hope the book will acquaint more people with a prodigious
hero. And wherever he may be, I hope Wallenberg has found peace. He
would be 86 today. &QL;

   The banner hung from a window of a residence hall on the Notre
Dame campus. The message was clear: ``Big Ten. Big Mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rest of the country was focusing on the Super Bowl in
Miami and the impeachment hearings in Washington, the Midwest _
particularly South Bend, Ind., and the Big Ten offices outside
Chicago _ was preoccupied with Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   To join or not to join? That is the question.
</P>
<P>
   Simple? Hardly. Nothing involving the non-declaration of
independence of the most preeminent Catholic university in college
sports is simple, and the topic of whether Notre Dame would choose
to give it up and join the Big Ten has raged for months.
</P>
<P>
   The lines of debate are also clear. The student body is against
it. The alumni are against it. And a large segment of the athletic
department is against it.
</P>
<P>
   A decision and an announcement will be made Friday in London,
where the Notre Dame Board of Trustees will convene.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the pro side is the academic community, which is almost
unanimously in favor of a Big Ten alliance for the most logical _
and, if you believe the true mission of any univeristy is
education, the most legitimate _ reasons.
</P>
<P>
   By becoming the Big Ten's 12th member, Notre Dame would be
eligible to join a consortium of Big Ten schools and the University
of Chicago called the Committee on Institutional Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   In academic circles, the CIC is a superpower, sharing
world-class minds, resources, and facilities, primarily on the
graduate school level but also in many other academic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame is regarded as a fine undergraduate institution, but
becoming part of the CIC would elevate the university to
world-class status.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least that's the argument.
</P>
<P>
   To reach that end, however, the cost would be steep: a loss of
independence, and some say identity in the athletic world as a
unique place.
</P>
<P>
   Tied to that concern would be the diminishment of Notre Dame's
role as the most prestigious Cathloic university in college
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, almost everyone is keeping their mouth shut
until the meeting in London, in itself a stunning upset.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten, which wants a 12th member for competitive reasons
in football _ it would allow the league to have two six-team
divisions and conduct a money-making championship game _ has
focused on the Irish as its target. Its only target thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany has made it clear that should
things not work out with Notre Dame _ both sides are wary of being
cast in the role of chaser or chasee _ the inclination would be to
quickly look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But first the Notre Dame situation must be resolved. ``If after
the Board of Trustees meets on Feb. 5, and if Notre Dame indicates
a serious interest in pursing Big Ten membership, the Conference
Board of Directors would then consider tendering an offer,'' said
Delany in a statement issued last week.
</P>
<P>
   The decision will have significant ramifications throughout
college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   The Big East is perhaps the most interested observer, since the
Irish are a conference member in all sports but football. If Notre
Dame leaves, the Big East would shrink _ with approval of the
members _ back to 12 teams in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Notre Dame also would prevent the Big Ten from
pursuing another conference member, Syracuse, which the Big East
does not want to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Syracuse goes, the Big East football league folds,'' said
one source familiar with the Big East mind-set regarding the Notre
Dame question. ``There will be a fire sale of other conference
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   But the prevailing sense of almost everyone, from people in the
Big Ten to several sources inside the Notre Dame hierarchy, is that
the Irish's answer will be no.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just waiting to see what happens with Notre Dame so we
can deal with the aftermath,'' said Big East commissioner Mike
Tranghese, who has been in constant touch with both Delany and
Notre Dame athletic director Mike Wadsworth.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by Notre Dame to remain an independent in football
would trigger a second series of negotiations. The consensus seems
to be that the Big Ten would make a move toward Syracuse, but the
likeliest result right now would be another polite rejection.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that, and not wanting to be perceived as searching for
suitors, the Big Ten would probably turn to Missouri, which would
welcome an invitation to join.
</P>
<P>
   And if that happens, a domino effect of reshuffling in
conference alignments could and probably would take place.

CONSUMER SPENDING BOOSTS RETAIL SALES IN JANUARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another sign of the economy's continued strength, consumers
kept up a brisk spending pace in January, giving the nation's
retailers a boost in what is often a slow month.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales surged ahead, as free-spending consumers took
advantage of clearance sales to load up on winter apparel.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, analysts say that the fourth quarter, which
includes the best holiday shopping season in six years, is likely
to be solid for many retailers, especially for discounters such as
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Dayton-Hudson Corp., which operates the
Target discount chain.
</P>
<P>
   January sales, though, can be tricky to gauge. In slashing
prices to lure shoppers for clearance sales, retailers can
sometimes squeeze their profit margins. As a result, strong sales
don't always translate into a strong bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, most January signs were positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it was an excellent month for most people,'' said
John Pitt, director of LJR Redbook, which tracks retail sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's shaping up to be a better fourth quarter than we
expected,'' Pitt added. ``The quarter started on an uncertain note
because of (unseasonably) warm weather, and it's ending on a much
stronger note than it began.''
</P>
<P>
   Many US consumers continue to spend, despite the high levels of
personal debt and the end of the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   ``So long as the economy remains stable, we can expect consumers
to do their thing,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's
Retail Trend Report.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most reliable measures of a retailer's performance is
something known as same-store sales, which gauges increases or
declines at stores open for at least a year. Same-store sales
exclude results from recently opened or closed stores.
</P>
<P>
   A composite same-store sales index calculated by Bloomberg News
found that January sales for the nation's biggest retailers were up
8.22 percent over the same month last year.
</P>
<P>
   The January gain was the biggest since last April.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement Corp., the Wellesley, Mass. off-price
retailer, said that same-store sales rose 11 percent in January and
3 percent for the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The increases, the company said in a statement, were ``driven
primarily by an inventory liquidation sale in our fine-jewelry
leased department.'' An ``aggressive level of markdowns'' was also
taken to clear fall inventory, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Filene's Basement, which plans to introduce a new leased jewelry
department later in the year, said that net fourth-quarter sales
grew 13 percent, to $174.7 million, and net sales for its full
fiscal year rose 6 percent, to $588.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Poor sales in January don't always mean disaster. Autumn apparel
sold so briskly at full price that there wasn't enough left over to
offer steep discounts at January clearance sales, according to
Talbots, the Hingham, Mass. retailer of women's clothing. As a
result, same-store sales in January fell 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But because sales were better than expected for the last three
months, fourth-quarter earnings could reach 26 cents on a per-share
basis, 2 cents higher than most Wall Street analysts had been
projecting, Talbots said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth quarter, net sales rose 7 percent, to $335.3
million, and fiscal year sales jumped 8 percent, to $1.14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   TJX Cos., the Framingham, Mass. operator of such off-price
chains as T. J. Maxx and Marshalls, had another strong month, with
January same-store sales up 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the full fiscal year, TJX said, net sales rose 9 percent, to
$7.95 billion. For the year, same-store sales rose 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   J. Baker Inc., a Canton, Mass. retailer that operates such
chains as Casual Male Big &AMP; Tall and Work 'n Gear, said that
January same-store sales were up 13.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, net sales rose to $584 million from $574 million,
or a bit less than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   BJ's Wholesale Club Inc. of Natick Mass. said January same-store
sales rose 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``BJ's posted strong gains in apparel, tires, furniture, and
computer equipment,'' said BJ's chief executive, Jack Nugent.
</P>
<P>
   For the full year, same-store sales were up 5.2 percent, and net
sales rose 11.8 percent, to $3.48 billion. BJ's Thursday announced
a 2-for-1 stock split, in the form of a dividend to be distributed
March 2 to stockholders of record as of Feb. 16, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Federated Department Stores posted a January same-store jump of
7.3 percent, but some of the gain came from shifting a big
promotional event for home furnishings from February to January.

FIDELITY TO FIELD THIRD INSTALLMENT IN LYNCH AD SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity Investments is about to launch Phase Three of
its much ballyhooed _ and criticized _ Peter Lynch ad campaign,
which was developed by Boston ad agency Hill Holliday Connors
Cosmopulos.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing to feature Lynch as Fidelity's gray eminence and a
font of investment advice, five new TV ads seek to highlight the
performance of some specific Fidelity funds, something previous ads
in the campaign didn't do.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to gain attention, ads launched in September paired
Lynch first with comic Lily Tomlin, then with Don Rickles.
</P>
<P>
   A second flight of ads had Lynch elaborating on his ``know what
you own and know why you own it'' message as he talked about
investment solutions and the pains Fidelity analysts took in
seeking companies to create strong portfolios.
</P>
<P>
   In the new set of ads, Lynch's co-star is not some Vegas comic,
but specific funds such as the Fidelity Aggressive Growth fund, the
Fidelity Dividend Growth fund, or the Fidelity Retirement Growth
fund, which make up a portion of the $752.7 billion in managed
assets Fidelity had at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In each new ad, Lynch is posed a question about investing, which
he proceeds to answer with a pithy bromide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the Peter Lynch campaign to its next evolution,''
said Stephen Cone, president of Fidelity Customer Marketing and
Development. ``We want investors to first know what they own and
why they own it, then we want to provide solutions to help them
decide how to invest. The next extension is to highlight specific
funds that customers might consider for building a diversified and
appropriate portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   The first round of Lynch ads were not well received by critics
who write for advertising trade publications.
</P>
<P>
   But ad reviews are much like movie reviews: Movies panned by the
critics become box-office smashes all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the artistic merits of the early Lynch ads, their
launch didn't seem to coincide with an immediate stampede of new
investors clamoring to buy Fidelity's products _ even though many
of those products were outperforming rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in December, however, interest in Fidelity funds
surged, according to Cone.
</P>
<P>
   One new TV ad has Lynch saying, ``Despite nine recessions since
World War II, the stock market is up 63-fold because earnings are
up 54-fold _ earnings drive the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Then peformance numbers of a specific Fidelity fund flash on the
screen. Next a graphic issues a call to action, urging viewers to
call Fidelity's 1-800 number or visit its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ads from the earlier phase of the campaign, featuring Lynch and
Rickles, will continue to air throughout this year, Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   As it undertook the difficult challenge of using TV ads to sell
mutual funds, Fidelity seemed to come up with a new ad theme almost
every year in the mid '90s. Cone, however, said Fidelity remains
committed to the Lynch campaign.

`SIGHT GAGS':   SERIOUSLY NOW, MOMA SHOWS THE HUMOROUS SIDE OF ART 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  By GRACE GLUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Humor, a relatively rare presence in art, is more apt
to occur in drawing than in painting or sculpture, possibly because
line has a quickness and lightness that makes it easy to convey.
But on the navel-searching New York scene, funny art is still
regarded with suspicion, and shows of it are few and far between.
So a new exhibition, ``Sight Gags: Grotesque, Caricature and Wit in
Modern and Contemporary Drawing'' at the Museum of Modern Art
through May 4 is a welcome occurrence.
</P>
<P>
   As for the specialness of humor-in-art shows: did you ever see
an exhibition whose declared theme was seriousness?
</P>
<P>
   It's true that art gradually has been infiltrated by animation
and comic strips, to which this show pays some homage. In fact,
``Sight Gags'' is meant to complement the museum's forthcoming
exhibition, opening April 1, of works on paper by Sigmar Polke, one
of the earliest postwar painters to exploit kitsch and popular
culture in humorous ways.
</P>
<P>
   For this Polke sidebar, organized by Laura Hoptman of the
museum's department of drawings, the Modern has culled some 80
works on paper by 65 artists from its own collection. Although it
has a respectable risibility quotient, it's a hit-or-miss
miscellany rather than a coherent survey of 20th-century
developments. But that may be asking too much from a show drawn
solely from the museum's collection.
</P>
<P>
   Four categories are established: caricature, the grotesque,
visual puns and conceptual jokes, and works inspired by comics and
cartoons, although of course there is overlap. The range of artists
is far and wide, from Jean Dubuffet and Joan Miro to Vito Acconci
and Robin Winters; the mediums run from a video piece by John
Baldessari to sketches for Disney animations to a giant wall
drawing of 1996 by Gary Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   The most penetrating category turns out to be the grotesque,
partly defined in the show as ``earthly and often vulgar'' and ``a
reproach to the spiritual and a negation of the ideal.'' An example
is George Grosz's ``Fit for Active Service'' (1918), a comment on
the selection of cannon fodder. In an examining room overpopulated
by preening officers and doctors, a skeleton is triumphantly
declared ready for battle.
</P>
<P>
   Another view of institutional obtuseness is Alfred Kubin's
``government'' (1901), depicting a shiplike juggernaut rumbling
through a landscape, belching black smoke. Tiny figures idle on one
of its decks while a pompous official on the deck below surveys the
scene as he manipulates what could be a telescope or a gun.
</P>
<P>
   On a different wavelength in the grotesque group is the detached
humor of Surrealism, which lends itself particularly to visual
zaniness, like Max Ernst's ``Farewell My Beautiful Land of Marie
Laurencin, Help! Help!'' (1919), an altered photoengraving of a
large, enigmatic machine ejecting from its top a smaller one. A
pre-Surrealist titillater is Odilon Redon's ``Eye Like a Strange
Balloon Mounts Toward Infinity'' (1882), in which a big,
heavy-lashed eye in the form of a balloon rises majestically above
a grassy field.
</P>
<P>
   Among less otherworldly contributions to this category are Jean
Dubuffet's ``Cow'' (1954), a bovine wreck sadly encumbered by a
very full udder, and his pages from ``El Golea II'' (1948), a
sketchbook that takes off on camels and desert people. They prove
that humor in art is often inseparable from draftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   The category of wit, which the Modern views as ``the ability to
perceive incongruous relationships and express them in a pointed
and/or sarcastic manner,'' includes entries as disparate as Louise
Bourgeois' ``Hold Up'' (1989), a simple suspender part sewn onto a
piece of pink blotting paper, and Baldessari's ``I Will Not Make
Any More Boring Art'' (1971), a videotape of a hand writing that
statement, like a schoolboy punishment, over and over again on a
piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
   More deadpan specimens are Christo's `` `Museum of Modern Art
Packed' Project'' (1968), a rendering of the Modern done up as a
package; and ``A Flux Suicide Kit'' (1966) by Ben Vautier, a member
of the subversive Fluxus group of the 1960s. The kit contains
matches, a syringe, a razor blade, a fish hook, an electric plug, a
nail and a tiny bullet.
</P>
<P>
   In caricature, the cast is large, from Miguel Covarrubias'
wonderful 1925 rendition of the comedian Fanny Brice _ all nose,
smile and black bangs _ attended by her adoring gambler husband,
Nicky Arnstein, to Robin Winters' ``Metropolitan Acquaintances''
(1974), three large panels bearing dozens of pencil sketches of
hilariously fanciful urban types.
</P>
<P>
   With uncharacteristic chauvinism, the Modern has also seen fit
to include works by or about a couple of its own former staff
members: Rene d'Harnoncourt, a former director of the museum, is
represented by a series of portrait ``D'Hoodles,'' and Monroe
Wheeler, the Modern's director of exhibitions for half a century,
who was sketched by several admirers _ including Ben Shahn _ who
took note of his slightly simian presence.
</P>
<P>
   The show's cartoon and comics section runs from Lyonel
Feininger's 1906 studies for a strip in The Chicago Tribune dealing
with the escapades of ``The Kin-der-Kids'' to Simmons' wall
drawing, ``Boom,'' a very satisfying cartoon explosion of 1996
especially reconstituted for this show. Other delights include
three 1980 comics-influenced drawings by Philip Guston (one is a
Beckettesque view of a ladder placed next to a chain of balls
descending from a calm blue sky) and Elizabeth Murray's ``Popeye''
(1982), a near-abstract collage that makes much of the
spinach-eating sailor's muscle power. (Some of this material, of
course, appeared in the 1990 exhibition ``High and Low,'' the
Modern's report on the bonding of mass and elite culture.)
</P>
<P>
   Although this show is far from an ideal homage to humor, it's
nice to know that one of our great museums is taking the subject
seriously.

UAM HIT BY HEAVY OUTFLOW IN 1998 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ United Asset Management Corp., a giant holding company
for 50 diverse investment firms, has for years watched clients
withdraw money as competitors garnered a flood of new business. The
leakage, during a strong stock market, has depressed UAM's share
price and sent the company soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   Now UAM says it is making substantial changes. Some investors,
while encouraged, are not yet convinced.
</P>
<P>
   UAM reported Thursday that clients yanked out a net $4.6 billion
from its units in the fourth quarter. That brought 1998's outflows
to $19.8 billion, compared to $16 billion in 1997 and $3.3 billion
in 1996. While the company staged a turnaround in earnings last
year, UAM chief executive Norton Reamer admitted that client cash
flow was still his top problem.
</P>
<P>
   UAM, which has generally taken 100 percent stakes in its units,
has a hands-off strategy, allowing affiliates to run themselves as
they wish and taking 41 percent of their revenue. Critics charge
that the approach can leave laggard units with little incentive to
attract new business.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Reamer says, he is acting on a vow made last year to invest
only in promising subsidiaries. The winners this year include
Acadian Asset Management Inc. of Boston, which plans a Singapore
office to start a private Asian equity fund, and Rogge Global
Partners PLC, a London fixed-income shop where UAM will bankroll
three new investment professionals. In all, 15 units will receive a
total of $20 million in assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Reamer also said that UAM recently established a group to
concentrate on winning new business at affiliates and reshuffled
its six-person management committee. Late last year, UAM revamped
its marketing approach after realizing that the holding company was
competing with, rather than supporting, its affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly a different company than we were a year ago,''
UAM spokesman John Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are skeptical. ``I guess we'll see,'' said Larry
Sondike, a senior vice president and fund manager at Franklin
Mutual Advisors, which as of last September was UAM's top
shareholder, with nearly 15 percent of the company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether increasing spending at affiliates will stem outflows
remains to be seen,'' Sondike said. But he said he was heartened by
UAM's share buyback and slowdown in expensive acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   UAM once spent all its money acquiring other firms. Now, in a
shift in its core strategy, UAM shells out cash to repurchase its
own depressed stock, a move Reamer deemed a good investment. The
company spent $270 million last year purchasing 11 percent of its
outstanding shares and is now buying 1 million shares a month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, UAM, with $201.4 billion in assets, has not ceased
looking for targets. ``We'd be very interested in doing a large
acquisition in the fixed-income area,'' Reamer said.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting analysts' expectations, UAM saw fourth-quarter net
income rise to $16.5 million, or $0.26 a share share, from a loss
of $75.4 million, or minus $1.09 a share, a year ago. Profits for
1998 were $78.5 million, compared with a loss of $4.1 million in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Around 45 percent of UAM's business is in defined-benefit
retirement plans. UAM says that the negative cash flow reflects an
industrywide trend toward defined-contribution plans and that every
one of its units is profitable, despite the outflows.
</P>
<P>
   UAM's stock, in the doldrums, rose 3/4 to close Thursday at 23
3/8 on the New York Stock Exchange.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's gross domestic product fell 4.6 percent in
1998, the sharpest drop in four years, the State Statistics
Committee reported Thursday. There were declines in industry,
construction and farming.
</P>
<P>
   Before the financial crisis, Russia's economy appeared to be
leveling off, and the government had hoped it would turn around
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the plunge of the ruble last summer paralyzed banking,
increased the cost of imports and discouraged investment. Russia's
fledgling financial services sector has been especially hard hit.
Some brokerages have laid off more than half their staff, and
Inkombank, a leading bank, is in bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The economic woes have been compounded by the fall in oil
prices, which has taken a heavy toll on export earnings. Russia
also suffered its worst harvest in decades.
</P>

MOSCOW COURT BACKS TREASON CHARGE FOR ATOM-WASTE WHISTLE-BLOWER
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's highest court Thursday refused to drop treason
charges against a retired officer who exposed nuclear pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, a setback for human rights groups, prolongs the
ordeal of the retired officer, Alexander Nikitin, who was arrested
three years ago after helping to document environmental pollution
by Russia's northern fleet.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin's arrest has already had a chilling effect on the
willingness of Russian researchers to investigate environmental
abuses by the military.
</P>
<P>
   It also highlights the weaknesses of Russia's judiciary, which
has been careful not to alienate the powerful security services by
acquitting Nikitin or bringing the case to a close.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin's lawyers had hoped that Russia's Supreme Court would
finally dispose of the case Thursday. But after a closed hearing,
the court sent the case back to the security services in St.
Petersburg for further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is bad news,'' said Diederik Lohman, director of the Moscow
office for Human Rights Watch. ``It means this case can go on
forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin, a retired captain, worked for 11 years as an engineer
on Soviet nuclear submarines and later served as a nuclear
inspector for the Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving his Defense Ministry post in 1992, he became a
consultant for Bellona, a Norwegian environmental organization that
was established after the 1986 disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear
plant in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
   Bellona has focused on northwestern Russia, where submarine
accidents, radioactive storage sites and the ocean dumping of
nuclear waste have prompted fears of nuclear pollution.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin angered the security services by helping to prepare a
chapter on Soviet nuclear submarine accidents. His supporters say
that the material in the chapter was drawn from unclassified
articles published in the Russian press and that the Russian
authorities were prosecuting him to discourage whistle-blowers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Russian Federal Security Service, an heir to the Soviet
KGB, charges that he revealed state secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The case is broadly parallel to that of Capt. Grigory Pasko, the
military journalist who is on trial in Vladivostok for helping the
Japanese news media document nuclear pollution by the Pacific
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some important differences. Nikitin has attracted
powerful supporters, among them Vice President Al Gore and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who have protested the case
to the Russian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case has gone on and on, and we do not see any basis for
it,'' a senior U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling insured that the case would go on some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a danger that the case of Alexander Nikitin will be
buried in red tape,'' said Genri Reznik, one of his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Nikitin's wife and daughter have moved to Canada while he
battles for acquittal. His lawyers are considering an appeal to the
European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, a move that would
elevate the political stakes but would not necessarily lead to a
quick resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Frederic Hauge, the managing director of Bellona, said the
Russian security services had already secured a victory of sorts:
Russians are increasingly afraid of looking into the question of
nuclear waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have gotten afraid of working with these issues,'' he
said. ``What is open today can be secret tomorrow, and then they
can be charged.''

SQUASH: NO REST FOR MIND OR BODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOE GLICKMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Long ago I decided squash was not for me. In my mind
it was an exclusive sport fancied by prep school boys and men with
portfolios. Never mind that a million Americans and 15 million
people worldwide now play squash. I knew little about it and just
assumed it was a grim indoor substitute for tennis.
</P>
<P>
   This fall I complained to Chris Widney, a cycling companion and
the head squash pro at the Printing House Fitness and Racquet Club
in Manhattan's West Village, how bored I get exercising indoors all
winter. He suggested I try squash. I explained my stance on the
sport. Widney, a playwright with a flair for the dramatic, said:
``Descartes separated the mind and body. Squash brings them back
together, kicking and screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   When I appeared unconvinced, he took another tack. ``Squash is
much more physically brutal than tennis,'' said Widney, who played
both at Fordham University. ``After a long point you're a wheezing
mess. You can barely lift your arm. And unlike tennis, you never
get to rest. You're in continuous anaerobic debt for an hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Now he had me. A longtime endurance sports fiend, I couldn't
bear to miss out on any form of athletic suffering. I agreed not
only to give it a try but also to play in his forthcoming
tournament, the Winter Squash Frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Had I any sense, I would have played twice a week for a month
before the competition. Instead, a week before the contest, I
arrived at the Printing House club for my first lesson. Once I was
inside the confines of the squash court, a brightly lighted
21-by-32-foot white room, Widney thrust a graphite racquet in my
hand, spent about 60 seconds on stroke mechanics and said, ``Go
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   I had expected a bit more instruction, like an explanation of
the rules. But Widney wanted me to hit and run and not get bogged
down in the game's X's and O's. ``I like to get beginners to chase
a ball like a little kid,'' he later told me. ``It forces them back
to their primal instincts.''
</P>
<P>
   As he headed for the small door in the clear Plexiglas back
wall, he said, ``I only have one thing to tell you: Keep your eye
on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for overcoaching.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the basics are quite simple. A point begins when the
server, standing in one of the service boxes two-thirds of the way
down the court, hits the ball to the front wall to rebound into the
opposite side of the four-wall court. Once the ball is in play, you
can hit it directly to the front wall, or off either of the side
walls or back wall en route to the front wall, as long as it lands
above the 17-inch-high piece of tin that runs along the bottom of
the front wall.
</P>
<P>
   You gain a point when your shot eludes your opponent. The first
player to reach nine points wins. (By comparison, racquetball,
which is played on a similar court, uses a racquet with a larger
head and a bouncier ball.)
</P>
<P>
   Rallying with another beginner, the first thing I noticed was
how little the hollow black ball bounced after it hit the floor.
Squash got its name from the ball, which squashes flat when it
meets the wall. The sport demands that you sprint, lunge and hit
often at the same time. Having once played a lot of tennis, I had
the hand-eye coordination to strike the ball competently, but I was
dazzled by the ball ricocheting around the room like a bee on
amphetamines. For the next two hours, I played sparring partner to
the D-level contenders that Widney tossed me in against. (There are
four skill levels in squash, from D up to A.) A solid squash player
possesses technique, finesse and the ability to anticipate which
way the ball will rebound off the wall. Lacking virtually all of
these, I did the only thing I could: I raced around the room as if
my shorts were on fire. Everyone I played thrashed me, but I
couldn't get over how good it felt to whack the ball without
worrying about it ``going long,'' the bane of my existence when I
played tennis.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of the night I felt as if my legs had been
through a gantlet. Spotting me gingerly walking up the stairs on
the way out, Widney shouted, ``I hope you don't have to sit down
tomorrow because you're going to have squash butt!'' He turned to
Anita Parrondo, a massage therapist at the club, and told her to
give me her card.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later I was back, stiff but undaunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Squash is a classic New York game,'' Widney said. ``It's all
about two people fighting over one small piece of real estate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the game, he said, is to take control of the ``T''
in the middle of the court, two-thirds of the way from the front
wall. From that spot, where the lines forming the two service boxes
meet in a T, you can get to any one place on the court with the
fewest steps.
</P>
<P>
   Widney showed me the four basic shots: the rail, a drive that
hugs either side wall; the boast, a shot that hits a side wall
before striking the front wall; the cross-court drive, and the
drop, a soft shot that dribbles off the front wall like a glass of
spilled milk. Then he gave me a few tips on how to move efficiently
around the court, perhaps the worst feature of my crude game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In squash,'' he said, ``anticipation and deception are huge.''
</P>
<P>
   I said, ``I thought you said fitness was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is,'' he said, ``especially if you can't anticipate or
deceive. Now, go play.''
</P>
<P>
   This lesson lasted perhaps 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   By the start of the tournament I had played three times. My
first opponent, a 5-foot-3-inch female editor who had recently had
major knee surgery, treated me like an unsolicited manuscript. In
the consolation game I faced a rangy graphic designer. Not only did
he beat me in three straight games (we played best out of five), I
only won six points.
</P>
<P>
   I was demoted to the novice division, an invention of Widney's
to give beginners more tournament experience. A lithe dancer, who
performs as a matador at the Metropolitan Opera, slew me in 20
minutes. In the novice consolation finals, my fourth and last
match, I squared off against a tall television writer. He wore
Clark Kent-style glasses but lacked a superhero's build. In the
field of 88 we had established ourselves as the two worst.
</P>
<P>
   We're still negotiating the television rights to the match, but
I can say this: I won the first two games, 9-5 and 9-7. He stormed
back to win the third, 9-2. In the fourth game my superior fitness
held sway, and I jumped to an 8-3 lead. But he closed the gap to
8-7 before I recaptured the serve and closed out the match. Victory
was mine!
</P>
<P>
   My work done, I relaxed into the role of spectator. Widney had
explained that beer figured prominently in the tradition of the
game, which began in the late 1700s in an English prison for
debtors and drunkards. I dutifully downed two cups of Brooklyn
Lager from the iced keg that sat on the viewing area above the
court and watched two scrappy players in the B division semifinal
flail away for nearly two hours. Their war of attrition included
elements of roller hockey and chess as played by psychopaths.
``Grunge squash,'' whispered a smirking Widney. ``Whoever's
standing at the end, wins.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being a lesson in humility for me and a huge
source of amusement for my old friend Widney, the tournament showed
me what I needed to know. That was his plan all along. After the
match, Widney, who was scheduled for shoulder surgery the next day,
introduced me to one of the club's other pros, Brett Newton, and
said, ``Now you are ready to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later I found myself warming up with Newton, a
31-year-old Australian who'd once been the 18th-ranked player in
the world. After several minutes he looked disdainfully at my loopy
topspin tennis forehand and told me to attack the ball as if I were
skipping a stone across a pond, giving it underspin. Suddenly, my
straight drives began exploding off the wall.
</P>
<P>
   For my backhand stroke he had me visualize drawing a saber from
its scabbard. Again the change in the ball's trajectory was
dramatic. We drilled virtually nonstop, with Newton hitting
everything straight to me. ``Keep your gun cocked, mate,'' he
barked, reminding me to run with my racquet back. ``No topspin! Let
it rip!''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 minutes sweat poured off me, and I was gasping for
breath. At the end of the lesson I wobbled to the shower as if I'd
been running stadium stairs. ``Best workout you can have in an
hour,'' he said. ``People who discover this sensation _ I call it
the post-squash glow _ get addicted to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now I had strokes! During the next few days, I was surprised by
how often I'd thought about squash. The game I thought worthy only
of my contempt had snared me: on the martial aspect of battling a
rival in a confined space, on the frenetic yet rhythmic dance of
two players jockeying for position, on the intense concentration
required to track a small black ball around white walls even as
your lungs scream for oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Hammering the hollow ball is a simple tonic that can purge all
that ails you. What had begun as a simple alternative to dreary gym
workouts was starting to feel dangerously like another sports
addiction.

DANIEL JOHNSTON: ECCENTRICITY, INSTABILITY AND ABIDING GRACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``My guitar string broke, and I'm really upset,''
muttered Daniel Johnston on Wednesday night at CBGB's 313 Gallery
in Manhattan. The capacity crowd cheered loudly for the Texas-based
singer-songwriter, just wanting to keep him onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, whose self-produced cassettes became fetish objects
for underground rockers in the early 1980s, has trouble getting
through more than a few songs in his infrequent performances.
Johnston has trouble in general; he has been institutionalized and
takes medication to subdue his mental demons. His drastically
heartfelt songs have earned him admirers, including the band Yo La
Tengo and choreographer Bill T. Jones, but Johnston &UR;  &LR; remains an
outsider artist, relentlessly focused on a microcosmic and
ultimately alienated vision.
</P>
<P>
   Why does one such eccentric get singled out? Here was Johnston,
a rotund man in sweat pants, punishingly strumming a cheap guitar
and warbling in a meek tenor grown rough around the edges. He sang
about Caspar the Friendly Ghost and funeral homes. ``Love will see
you through,'' he intoned, but he also told of feeling like a
vampire. His optimism was as desperately credulous as his fears
were stark.
</P>
<P>
   He might have been huddled before an open guitar case in the
subway baring his heart for quarters. Instead, he was starting a
mini-tour that ends at the Knitting Factory Friday night. His crude
songs did communicate a deep grace; their guileless longing was the
kind most people are too proud to express. Perhaps his audience
feels grateful for that.
</P>
<P>
   Yet how much Johnston's instability influenced his fans'
feelings remained unclear. Do they believe his lack of inner
boundaries make him more honest? And if there is truth in the link
between art and madness, why do all of us not take more time to
listen to the ragged bards on our own street corners?

`STREET OF DREAMS': HE'S BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THE SCORE
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes at end of review) 
(DW) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Midway in James Naughton's impeccably suave solo
concert show ``Street of Dreams,'' the lean, handsome, slightly
weatherbeaten actor and singer pauses to reminisce for a moment
about the 1989 Broadway musical ``City of Angels,'' in which he
portrayed an impeccably suave Los Angeles gumshoe. As Naughton
tosses off hilarious snippets of Larry Gelbart's dialogue spoofing
Raymond Chandler, you have the sensation that Naughton and his
stage alter ego of a decade ago aren't all that far apart in
outlook. Both are guys who think they know the score. Both would
rather die than ever be glimpsed losing their cool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Street of Dreams,'' at the Promenade Theater, is an immensely
entertaining musical evening, in which Naughton, accompanied by a
first-rate pop quintet, saunters through assorted popular standards
and jazz nuggets with the assurance of a star athlete marking off
the telephone numbers of favorite dates on his bulging Rolodex.
</P>
<P>
   The show, a theatrical extension of a cabaret act he debuted
last June at the Manhattan Theater Club, is ``presented'' at the
Promenade by Mike Nichols, who has spiffed it up in helpful ways.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the monologues are longer and more carefully worked
out; the material flows more evenly, and the comedy has been
accentuated. Once again, the singer is backed by John Oddo, an
exceptionally talented pianist and musical director leading a group
who also double as background vocalists, in one number becoming the
Mills Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton is not only a gifted pop-jazz crooner in a tradition
that includes Bing Crosby, Johnny Hartman and Joe Williams; he is
also a polished after-dinner narrator of tall theater tales. A
comic high point of his show is a monologue about actors going up
on their lines that ends with a priceless anecdote about a moment
in which John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson once found themselves
facing each other on the stage unable to make a sound.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Street of Dreams,'' for all its humor, is essentially an
evening of music, in which Naughton applies himself to material as
far-ranging as ``Star Dust'' and Randy Newman's caustic, dramatic
monologue ``My Life Is Good.'' As much as Naughton has
distinguished himself as a musical theater singer, the voice he
displays in ``Street of Dreams'' is revelatory in its flexibility
and sheer beauty.
</P>
<P>
   That voice, a deep, resonant baritone, divides into two parts.
The upper register is a strikingly rich, mellow crooning voice.
Shaded downward, it becomes a noticeably rougher but still fairly
velvety bass-baritone. It's a remarkable instrument, because there
simply aren't many male voices anywhere who make a sound this
languorously inviting. Crooning classics like ``Star Dust,'' ``The
Folks Who Live on the Hill,'' and ``She's Funny That Way,''
Naughton conveys the dreamy, paternal homeyness of a younger,
hipper Crosby.
</P>
<P>
   But beneath his smooth, serenely seductive surface, Naughton
displays a stubborn diffidence. Throughout the show, both in his
singing and in the stories he chooses to tell, you sense someone
who is either fiercely protective of his emotional privacy or
unwilling to explore the vulnerable or tragic side of life. Beyond
being unapologetically beautiful, his singing takes few emotional
risks.
</P>
<P>
   Naughton glides over the surface of Billy Strayhorn's bitter,
alcoholic confession ``Lush Life'' without seeming to notice that
the lyric is a self-lacerating expression of heartbreak and
despair.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of ``Lush Life,'' impeccably suave just won't do.
Crooning the Elvis Presley signature song ``Are You Lonesome
Tonight?'' he also maintains a safe emotional distance, treating
the song's central spoken monologue as dead space that's easier to
mock than to try to bring to life. What makes Presley's version so
compelling is the punchy sincerity he invested in those hopelessly
corny spoken verses.
</P>
<P>
   If Naughton can't bring himself to risk shedding even an ounce
of cool, his casual bravado serves him impressively in the uptempo
songs, especially ``I Want You to Be My Baby,'' an uproarious piece
of jumping jive composed by Jon Hendricks. He also has great fun
with Hank Snow's 1962 country hit, ``I''ve Been Everywhere,'' a
tongue-twisting bit of geographical name-dropping in which he
vocally accelerates into an auctioneer's full-tilt bark. Naughton
can swing hard and loose, and when he does, his voice toughens
without losing its limber pliability.
</P>
<P>
   Dramatically Naughton is most at home with numbers that hand him
full-blown characters. He is very funny, mugging and flapping
around as the pretentious narrator of the Dave Frishberg-Bob
Dorough jazz novelty ``I'm Hip,'' in which a would-be '60s cool-cat
drops all the wrong names (Sammy Davis Jr., Bobby Darin) to certify
his hipster credentials. He is even funnier declaiming ``My Life Is
Good,'' Newman's savage first-person portrait of a smug, soulless
Los Angeles businessman obsessed with cocaine and brand names.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Street of Dreams'' is a virtuosic star turn, it lacks a
definitive number in which the singer makes that final leap and
dares to give himself away. Naughton will soothe you, amuse you and
get your feet tapping. He'll show you many wonderful songs you
might have missed, and wow you with his sound. One thing he won't
do is break your heart.

 &HT;    AirTran closer to profitability
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AirTran Airways failed to fly out of the red in the
fourth quarter, despite strong revenue gains and lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   But the loss narrowed from a year earlier, and AirTran's new
chief executive maintained a long-awaited turnaround is just over
the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have much to look forward to,'' said Joseph B. Leonard, who
replaced D. Joseph Corr at AirTran's helm last month. ``We believe
that in 1999 we will see the results of our reorganization,
improved operations, hard work and caring customer service
reflected in the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   Today AirTran is expected to announce schedule changes that will
include an additional destination from Hartsfield International
Airport, and new tour package products.
</P>
<P>
   The airline has 18 gates at Hartsfield but has worked out an
agreement with airport officials to double up at four gates,
providing new room for growth, Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran is headquartered in Orlando, Fla., but has its main
flight hub at Hartsfield. Leonard told analysts Thursday he plans
no big shift in that strategy, despite the challenge of competing
with Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth quarter, AirTran Holdings Inc. said it lost $3
million, or 5 cents a share, excluding a one-time $27.5 million
write-off related to planned retirements of Boeing 737s. Including
that charge, the net loss was $30.5 million, or 47 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   In the same quarter of 1997, the carrier lost $40.7 million, or,
63 cents a share, including charges.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue for the quarter rose 51 percent, to $105.7 million, on a
40 percent capacity increase. Operating costs declined 29 percent,
led by a 24 percent fall in fuel prices.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons the higher revenue and lower costs didn't
produce a profit was a drop in average fares to $71.30 vs. $83.88 a
year earlier. AirTran in recent months has offered continuous sales
to lift ridership.
</P>
<P>
   That effort was moderately successful, raising average load
factors to 57.1percent for the quarter compared with 52.1 percent a
year earlier. Leonard said further gains this year, coupled with
declining costs, should bring profits.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran finished the year with $24.3 million in cash, down from
$34.5 million at the end of the third quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said the airline faces about $18.5 million in outlays
this year for required noise modifications to DC-9 jets and
pre-payments on new Boeing 717s scheduled for delivery late this
year. However, he said he expects no liquidity crunch because
AirTran should be ``cash-positive'' from March forward and is
selling some minor assets to build cash. The new jets will be
financed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran Holdings stock rose 21 7/8 cents Thursday to $3.43 3/4.

 &HT;    AGL chief takes blame for rate disaster
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ AGL Resources, parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co., holds
its annual shareholders meeting today with Chief Executive Walter
M. Higgins taking full responsibility for the recent rate fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theres no question that it's hurt the company,'' Higgins in an
interview Thursday. He noted some similarities to Coca-Cola Co.'s
disastrous launch of New Coke more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today's 10 a.m. meeting at Cobb Galleria, which is open to
registered shareholders only, is the second for Higgins as
president and CEO of AGL Resources and chief executive of Atlanta
Gas Light Co.
</P>
<P>
   AGL plans to release its first fiscal quarter earnings later
today after the stock market closes.
</P>
<P>
   The company warned last week that earnings would be lower than
analysts expect because of losses at Sonat Marketing Co., a natural
gas wholesale venture in which it holds a 35 percent stake.
Analysts had expected earnings of 38 cents per share, according go
First Call Corp. The Sonat Marketing losses are expected to shave
off about 10 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said the losses stemmed from an error in accounting for
natural gas transactions by the unit, which is managed by
Birmingham, Ala.-based Sonat. They should result in only a one-time
charge, since the accounting has been straightened out, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said the earnings announcement, coupled with the furor
over Atlanta Gas Lights rates, had clearly contributed to a decline
in AGL's stock price during the last month from $23 to less than
$20.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins noted that most utility stocks have been dropping
because of the anticipated adverse impact of warm weather on sales.
The bond market has also been taking a beating, and utility stocks
tend to follow bonds.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting today, Higgins said he will review his first
year as CEO, during which the nation's eighth-largest gas utility
began an unprecedented shakeup with deregulation of Georgia's
natural gas market. He will also discuss ``some of what went on''
with Atlanta Gas Light's rates ``and what we have done to try and
deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The company had undergone ``a thousand post-mortems trying to
understand'' how it so badly miscalculated with the rate structure
that was put in place Nov. 1 with the start of deregulation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   To recover its expenses as customers began purchasing gas from
marketers, AGL's newly deregulated rates were heavily based on
costs for interstate pipeline capacity theoretically needed to
serve homes and businesses on the coldest day of the year. When
this winter's temperatures turned out to be unseasonably warm,
consumers were left footing hefty bills for pipeline capacity they
didn't use.
</P>
<P>
   After thousands of complaints flooded the utility's call centers
and the Public Service Commission, Atlanta Gas Light reached a
settlement with regulators last week that called for $14.5 million
in refunds and scrapping the rate structure in favor of one based
entirely on actual gas consumption.
</P>
<P>
   According to Higgins, ``dozens of people'' inside the company,
as well as an outside consultant, worked for weeks formulating the
new rate structure.
</P>

   ``Many of us, including me, participated in discussions of
setting this up,'' he said. Many options were considered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that on the final day that anyone said, 'Let's go
with that one,' `` he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Higgins said he knew of no one who spoke up
and warned of the potential impact of warm weather. But he added
that he takes full responsibility for what, in retrospect, was a
big mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody else that's responsible except me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said the comparison to New Coke was a ``very apt
description'' of what occurred. At a special board meeting last
month, he said, board member Frank Barron Jr., vice president of
public affairs at Coca-Cola Bottling Co. of Rome, said the rate
crisis ``was similar to what Coke faced,'' Higgins recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based soft drink company ``had many of the same
customer issues'' when grocers and other vendors saw their sales
threatened by the abrupt change of brands, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid a repeat of the rate debacle, Higgins said the company
has put together a full-time team, under Henry P. Linginfelter,
former vice president of new business, to ``think through millions
and millions of issues'' that may arise as deregulation proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   One issue is what happens when those customers who have not
selected a marketer realize they have been assigned to one at
random by the PSC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess who they will call?'' Higgins mused.

`NATALIE COLE': DADDY'S TORCHBEARER LIFTS HER OWN TORCH 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What are Cole family values? The teaming of Natalie
Cole and her uncle Freddy (at the Blue Note through Monday), with
the genial voice of her father, Nat, pumped over the sound system
for the inevitable posthumous father-daughter duet on
``Unforgettable,'' offers an entertaining musical seminar on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Ms. Cole's uncles, Eddie, is also making an indirect
appearance, with the performance by Natalie and Freddy of ``Sweet
Someone,'' a ballad he once sang as part of a duo called Eddie and
Betty.
</P>
<P>
   Shared musical values were certainly in evidence at Wednesday's
early show, at which Ms. Cole and her uncle projected the same
studied graciousness that was a calling card of Nat, who died in
1965. Like their legendary relative who casts a benevolent
ever-lengthening shadow over music, the brother and the daughter
are jazz singers who instinctively add a smooth pop gloss to their
material.
</P>
<P>
   Freddy Cole, who is 12 years younger than Nat and the youngest
of five children, puts his own spin on the Cole style. His singing
is noticeably rougher and more overtly blues-tinged. What he shares
with his brother is enunciation so pristine that every syllable
comes out glistening.
</P>
<P>
   In a show that concentrated largely on songs popularized by Nat,
Freddy's blues leanings added a welcome touch of earthiness to
``Wild Is Love,'' ``Never Let Me Go'' and ``To the Ends of the
Earth,'' songs memorable mostly for the fact that Nat recorded
them.
</P>
<P>
   Cole's quintet, which featured himself on piano and Gerry Byrd
on guitar, played with a seamless coordination that suggested the
meshing of well-oiled machinery. When Ms. Cole joined her uncle,
the emphasis remained on Nat songs, the two casually trading verses
of ``Somewhere Along the Way'' and ``Send for Me.''
</P>
<P>
   For her solo set, Ms. Cole brought in her own band. As much as
she tries to emulate her father's warmth and air of supreme ease,
there's always been an undercurrent of tension and ambivalence in
her singing. Should she be daddy's little girl, a light cheerful
chip off the old block recycling Nat's legacy in a spirit of
worshipful nostalgia? Or has the time come for her to strike out
into grittier territory?
</P>
<P>
   The show on Wednesday found her playing it both ways. In
pleasant, lightly swinging pop-jazz versions of songs like
``Smile'' and ``Route 66,'' she was the dutiful daughter looking
back adoringly. But ``Frim Fram Sauce'' and ``I'm a Woman'' found
her grasping at a tougher, bluesier sensuality as though seeking
release from the ultimately limiting and oppressive role of
official torch-bearer.

 &HT;    MCI WorldCom re-enters Internet market
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ MCI WorldCom is back in the Internet access business.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced a new Internet service dubbed MCI WorldCom
Internet aimed at residential customers, through a partnership with
online service CompuServe, a subsidiary of America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the agreement, which is not exclusive for
either partner, were not revealed.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call Thursday, MCI WorldCom and CompuServe said
the service will feature customized ``start pages'' of news,
sports, weather and other features furnished by CompuServe.
</P>
<P>
   Cost for 150 hours will be $16.95 for MCI long distance
customers and $19.95 for those who use only the Internet service,
with three introductory months priced at $16.95. Prospective users
can sign up now at http://www.mciworld.com or by phone at (800)
459-8892.
</P>
<P>
   MCI previously offered Internet service but was forced to sell
that business to Cable &AMP; Wireless for $1.75 billion to win
regulatory approval for its merger with WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   The new service is also another step on the comeback trail for
CompuServe, one of the first commercial online services.
CompuServe's business fortunes were sagging until its purchase by
AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's deal provides it with a strong partner and a
guarantee of new online users. Unlike fellow online provider
Prodigy, which ventured onto the Internet alone, CompuServe will
provide content only and let MCI WorldCom provide the dial up
connection.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to CompuServe content, MCI WorldCom Internet
customers will be able to download a licensed version of
CompuServe's Instant Messenger software, free parental control
software from Cyber Patrol, Web page building and Internet search
functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``MCI WorldCom understood that CompuServe was the best brand to
offer their customers the best experiences for busy adults on the
'Net,'' said CompuServe Chief Operating Officer Audrey Weil. ``It's
the first time CompuServe has been a gateway for ISP subscribers.
This represents a significant U.S. revenue stream for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say MCI has to get back into the Internet business to
be competitive within the industry. Christopher Mines, director of
new-media research at Forrester Research, said MCI WorldCom's
challenge will be to differentiate itself in a very crowded market.
However, CompuServe's business focus, combined with airline
partnerships and frequent flyer offerings, should help draw an
initial distinction.
</P>
<P>
   America Online bought CompuServe last year in a three-way
agreement with WorldCom Inc. and H&AMP;R Block Inc., which owned
CompuServe at the time. Dulles, Va.-based America Online has more
than 15 million subscribers, while CompuServe has about 2 million
members.
</P>
<P>
   Although MCI WorldCom's consumer Internet access service does
compete with CompuServe's own online service and with AOL's online
service, Weil stressed that she expects to see more such alliances
among competitors in the future.

UN INSPECTION TEAM CHIEF TO STEP DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Richard Butler, the beleaguered chief UN
weapons inspector, said Thursday that he would step down at the end
of June. The decision follows an outcry over reports that the
United States used the Australian arms specialist's office to spy
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Butler told CNN Thursday that he would ``move on'' when his
contract expires June 30. ``I quite frankly don't think I'll be
seeking an extension,'' he said. But he added that he would devote
his remaining five months in office to fighting for the survival of
the UN Special Commission, called UNSCOM, credited with destroying
more Iraqi weapons than the US-led alliance during the 1991 Persian
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is showing signs that an expanding US air campaign against
its antiaircraft batteries is taking a toll. US officials said that
Iraq had begun to withdraw its air-defense systems from the US- and
British-patrolled ``no-fly zones'' in southern and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials estimate that they have destroyed 20 percent
of Iraq's air defense systems since the air war on Iraq, dubbed
Operation Desert Fox, began Dec. 16. The US and Britain have
destroyed or damaged 40 antiaircraft batteries since Dec. 28, when
the US and Iraq began engaging in daily skirmishes in the no-fly
zones.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is evidence that'' Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ``is
pulling back,'' said US Defense Secretary William S. Cohen. ``I
think it is clear . . . that he doesn't want to lose all of his''
surface-to-air missiles ``and doesn't want to place his troops in
greater jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, meanwhile, has come under pressure from Russia, France,
China, and other council members to resign since he released a
December report that underscored Iraqi intransigence on disarmament
and triggered the US bombing campaign. Those countries have long
supported Iraq's position that UNSCOM has overreached its mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Moscow again demanded Butler's resignation in a
letter to UN Secretary General Kofi Annan. The demand came in
response to Butler's charge, leveled in an interview with an
Australian newspaper, that Russia's UN ambassador, Sergei Lavrov,
was spreading lies about Butler allegedly serving US interests in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest report to the Security Council last month, Butler
defended the use of Western intelligence to investigate Iraq's
efforts to conceal its chemical and biological weapons programs.
Butler chronicled a long and persistent Iraqi policy of lying to
the United Nations about the programs. He said that any serious
effort to prevent Iraq from developing new weapons must involve
UNSCOM's weapons specialists.
</P>
<P>
   US officials defended Butler's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done an excellent job at a very difficult time and
we'll continue to push Iraq to comply with disarmament
obligations,'' said US national security spokesman David Leavy.
``We still believe UNSCOM is the best way to deal with the
disarmament of Iraq and we'll continue to work with Chairman
Butler.''
</P>
<P>
   Council diplomats said that Butler's departure would do little
to guarantee UNSCOM's preeminent role in disarming Iraq. In the
wake of the bombing, the UN Security Council has established three
panels to ensure that Iraq meets its obligations to disarm, provide
humanitarian relief to its people, and to account for hundreds of
Kuwaiti citizens who disappeared during the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   The disarmament panel, which is to be headed by Brazil's UN
ambassador Celso Amorim, provides an opportunity for countries
hostile to UNSCOM to try to dilute its influence. UNSCOM's efforts
to detect Iraq's efforts to rebuild its prohibited weapons program
have been severely undermined by its departure from the country in
December.
</P>
<P>
   But US officials that UNSCOM's expertise must be retained if the
United Nations is ever to eliminate all of its long-range missiles
and nuclear, chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``UNSCOM is not folding,'' said Peter Burleigh, the chief US
representative to the United Nations. ``From the US perspective
it's very important that it continue to function as vigorously as
it has in the past because it is depository of all this accumulated
knowledge about Iraq.''

HARVARD CLUB TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION IN ALLEGED THEFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The Harvard Alumni Club of Hong Kong voted Thursday
to pursue legal action against its former president, whom club
members accuse of stealing $504,000 from club funds and donations.
</P>
<P>
   Between November 1996 and October 1997, Stephen Wai-wan Chik
allegedly transferred into his personal accounts a donation meant
for the university as well as club monies as payment for
``professional and secretarial services,'' according to financial
documents reviewed by club auditors and attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Chik, a 1986 graduate, has returned 80 percent of the funds. But
members present _ 38 out of a membership of 300 _ voted
overwhelmingly to sue him for the remainder, and to turn
information over to police for a possible criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The move to hold him accountable will send waves through the
city's elite, since the dynamic young financier was once a darling
of senior alumni in finance and government.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sense, the vote marks a new beginning for the club, a
chance to redeem the group's name and recover from accusations that
a tight circle of powerful alumni stalled the investigation to
protect Chik and Harvard's name.
</P>
<P>
   Although nearly all present voted to take legal action, several
people had reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's very practical, because I don't think
there's a good chance of recovering money. . . . Any legal action
takes money and we open ourselves to the possibility that if we
lose, we pay his costs,'' said Reuben Mondejar, who holds a 1988
master's degree in international studies.
</P>
<P>
   The club's executive committee set aside $26,000 last November
for legal fees, and a large chunk has already been spent consulting
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said Mondejar, who served as vice president under
Chik, ``I think the members have spoken and I think it's a good
thing. There were views expressed before . . . that the executive
committee was taking decisions without consulting members, so this
was a chance to consult them. It can be seen as a cleansing of the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts to reach Chik for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Weaver, a 1995 Harvard Law School graduate, said: ``It's a
hard call any time you have to decide on litigation. But I think
there are reasons beyond money. There are moral reasons, and I
think people took those into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Weldon, a 1959 Harvard graduate who works as a consultant,
said he ``absolutely'' agrees with the vote, because it underlines
respect for law. ``Here we are in Hong Kong worrying about whether
China will allow Hong Kong to exist with the rule of law, and I
don't think we've been following it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon said that the club and its foundation did not undergo
annual audits, as required by club bylaws and Hong Kong law.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina Fang, a 1988 graduate and a lawyer, said another member
recounted a story at the meeting of a business associate who called
looking for a reference check on Chik, to whom he had already lent
$2 million. When the businessman learned that the club believed
Chik had taken club funds, he questioned why the club had not
publicized it to warn others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens have an obligation to report crimes _ it seems so
obvious,'' said Fang, who joined other members at the fashionable
China Club Thursday to review documents and get briefed by a lawyer
before voting.
</P>
<P>
   Members voted not to pursue action against former treasurer Yun
Ed Wong, holder of a 1989 Harvard PhD in geophysics, who signed
blank transfer notes that Chik allegedly used to siphon club funds.
Wong, who was an employee of Chik's at the time, gave a speech at
the meeting saying he was ``a victim'' like everyone else and that
he ``trusted (Chik) as a friend and as a fellow Harvard man.''
</P>
<P>
   Chik, who served as president for four years, did not attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Wong said he was relieved the club was not
holding him responsible, and said he would cooperate with police.
Wong defended himself against accusations by some members that he
put his friendship and trust of a fellow alumnus over his fiduciary
responsiblity to the rest of the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before me, all the bank statements went straight to the
president,'' Wong said. ``I suppose I could have started a new
trend, but I didn't.''

A $125 MILLION ACCOUNT MAY BE FALLING OUT OF LOVE WITH LOWE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Mich., N.J., Germany)  By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The once-strong ties between Mercedes-Benz of North
America and its agency of more than five years, Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS
in New York, appear to be fraying after an unusual meeting at which
Mercedes-Benz executives were described as having expressed
``concern'' over ``serious'' issues affecting their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is emblematic of the increasingly fragile and
volatile nature of agency-client relations as well as the
importance of personal relationships between marketers and their
agency counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes-Benz account, with billings estimated at $125
million, is one of the most prestigious in the competitive North
American automotive industry. After suffering declines during the
recession of the early 1990s, Mercedes-Benz has bounced back,
setting a sales record in 1998. Among Lowe's contributions has been
the creation of award-winning campaigns that included an acclaimed
commercial featuring the Marlene Dietrich recording of ``Falling in
Love Again.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems that the client and agency may be falling out of
love after a meeting that took place on Wednesday between top
executives of Mercedes-Benz, a unit of DaimlerChrysler AG, and
Lowe, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Cos.
The meeting was disclosed Thursday in response to inquiries by a
reporter checking a tip that Mercedes-Benz had dismissed Lowe,
which has handled the account since November 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not dismissed the agency,'' said Donna Boland, a
spokeswoman for Mercedes-Benz in Montvale, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she added, Michael Jackson, president and chief
executive, and Joe Eberhardt, vice president for marketing, met
with Lowe executives on Wednesday to ``discuss the seriousness of
the situation and express concern about two issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We opened the door to these discussions yesterday,'' Ms.
Boland said, ``and there will be further discussions with Lowe next
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point in time, we probably will have something to tell
you one way or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee Garfinkel, chairman and chief creative officer at Lowe,
confirmed that a meeting took place at the agency on Wednesday with
the Mercedes-Benz executives, but he declined to discuss details.
</P>
<P>
   One issue brought up at the Wednesday meeting, Ms. Boland said,
was ``whether there is a conflict with the Interpublic global
alliance with General Motors after the creation of
DaimlerChrysler.'' Her reference was to the fact that agencies like
Ammirati Puris Lintas, Campbell-Ewald and McCann-Erickson Worldwide
Advertising _ which like Lowe are owned by Interpublic _ handle GM
brands like GMC trucks, Chevrolet and Buick.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors Corp. is of course a longtime competitor of
Chrysler Corp., which merged with Daimler-Benz AG last year to form
DaimlerChrysler. Chrysler agencies include the BBDO Worldwide unit
of Omnicom Group and the Bozell Worldwide unit of True North
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The other issue discussed at the Wednesday meeting, Ms. Boland
said, was ``the current management situation at Lowe,'' including
``attrition'' _ a reference to the abrupt departure last month of
Robert A. Kantor, president for U.S. operations _ and ``the absence
of Marvin, certainly.''
</P>
<P>
   That reference was to Marvin Sloves, who retired on Dec. 31 as
co-chairman of Lowe after serving in that post for four years and
as a vice chairman for a year before that. Sloves retired with the
expiration of a two-year extension of what had been a three-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' Ms. Boland said, ``is we are concerned
about the current management situation'' at Lowe.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about the state of relations between Mercedes-Benz
and Lowe intensified with the retirement of Sloves because he had
been particularly close to executives at Mercedes-Benz since his
previous agency, Scali, McCabe, Sloves in New York, landed the auto
marketer's account in 1992. The account came to Lowe along with
Sloves when Scali, McCabe was acquired and merged into Lowe in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   There also has been speculation in trade publications like The
Delaney Report that Sloves, a hale man who still relishes the
business, had sought to stay on beyond Dec. 31. Asked about that in
an interview on Dec. 8, Sloves replied: ``No, no, no, I never
really thought about it. It was the end of my contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Garfinkel and Sloves had been co-chairmen at Lowe; with Sloves'
retirement, Garfinkel became the sole chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Garfinkel concurred with Ms. Boland about the subjects discussed
at the meeting. One was ``potential conflicts'' related to General
Motors and Interpublic, he said, and the other was what he called
``management issues at the agency that existed in 1998.''
</P>
<P>
   In articles that appeared on Jan. 25, the advertising trade
publications Frohlinger's Marketing Report and Adweek reported that
Sloves was discussing with executives at other agencies joining
them and bringing the Mercedes-Benz account with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My understanding is that Marvin is not out there on our
behalf,'' Ms. Boland said, adding: ``We do not have a contract with
him. Our contract is with the agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the agencies mentioned by Frohlinger's as possible new
homes for the Mercedes-Benz account was BBDO New York, a unit of
BBDO Worldwide. The trade publication Advertising Age reported this
week that Pentacom in Troy, Mich., a unit of BBDO Worldwide, had
been named to handle media services for Mercedes-Benz in North
America on an interim basis as DaimlerChrysler examines a permanent
realignment of media duties after the merger.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible new home for the account cited by Frohlinger's
was Foote, Cone &AMP; Belding Worldwide, which is a sibling agency to
Bozell under the True North umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Asked on Dec. 8 whether the Mercedes-Benz links with Lowe were
jeopardized because of his retirement, Sloves demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's here because of me,'' he said then.
</P>
<P>
   But now the account, with billings that represent up to 20
percent of Lowe's total of $750 million, may be departing.
</P>
<P>
   The turmoil on the account comes despite the fact that
Mercedes-Benz sold a record number of vehicles in the United States
in 1998. Sales of cars and sport utility vehicles totaled 213,379,
up 55.9 percent from 1997; car sales climbed 39.2 percent, and its
sport utility vehicle sales rose 196.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, car sales increased 6 percent from January 1998,
while factory capacity kept sales of sport utility vehicles even
with the month a year earlier.

CELLUCCI OFFERS UMASS TRUSTEES A DEAL ON TUITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY AND KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Governor Paul Cellucci said Thursday he will restore
$4.6 million to the University of Massachusetts if the board of
trustees reverses its decisions to raise tuition and fees.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with Boston Globe reporters and editors, Cellucci
said he was imploring the trustees to keep student costs down, and
if they do, he would not push legislation he filed this week
stripping the board members of control over tuition and fees. Nor
would he veto $4.6 million in funding _ the amount equivalent to
the higher student costs _ from his proposed budget next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to push pretty hard to get the board to change
their vote,'' Cellucci said during the lunch meeting. ``Their
changing their vote would mean the legislation is less likely'' to
be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Connolly, spokesman for UMass President William M.
Bulger, said that while the trustees were open to the governor's
ideas on how to generate money without raising fees, they also felt
they had ``charted the right course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly open to any suggestion the governor may
have,'' Connolly said. ``But our chief concern is that university
students have the resources, the technical resources and the
classroom resources, they need to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said that all five of the student trustees were in
favor of the fee increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students they represent want to see some improvements and
want to have some of the additional resources that their
counterparts at other universities have,'' he said. ``They feel
they shouldn't be asking the taxpayers to contribute more, they,
the students, should be contributing more.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``nothing is set in stone.''
</P>
<P>
   The fee increase the board approved Wednesday _ an average of
$67 for students who do not live on campus, and $251 for those who
do _ will pay for revamping computer labs across the four
undergraduate campuses. The fees will also allow UMass to complete
a fiber optic cable that will enable, say, a student at Dartmouth
to access the Amherst campus library. It will pay the university's
share of new campus center construction in Boston and Lowell,
Connolly said, and 20 percent of student fees goes to need-based
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci said the relatively small amount of the tuition hike
was not the point because UMass is still expensive compared to
other public universities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want it to be more affordable for more families,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, outraged that the board members he appointed did not
heed his call to continue the four-year trend of reducing tuition
and fees, filed a bill Wednesday to have the Board of Higher
Education set the rates instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having control there is important,'' he said. ``I
should have been given a heads-up on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Trustees are appointed to five-year terms and Cellucci believes
they cannot be fired over policy issues. But as the board seats
open up, prospective trustees will be asked where they stand on the
issue of tuition increases, the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the governor will not interfere with UMass President
William Bulger's 49 percent pay raise, believing the former Senate
President has improved standards on campuses throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   And he said Bulger's salary, eventually climbing to $282,000 a
year, should not factor into the debate over upwardly creeping
tuition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure those issues are related,'' he said.

CLINTON CONSIDERS SENDING U.S. TROOPS TO KOSOVO AS PART OF NATO
FORCE 

</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton outlined Thursday the conditions
under which U.S. military forces would join NATO ground troops in
the troubled Kosovo region as he acknowledged for the first time
that he is ``seriously considering'' deploying American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials stepped up efforts to make their case
on why the United States should join European forces in the
Yugoslav province if the warring factions reach a peace accord this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time to stop this conflict in Kosovo is now, before it
spreads, and when it can be contained at an acceptable cost,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the Serbian Parliament voted to send a delegation
to France this weekend for peace talks with Kosovo's Albanians. But
Serb Premier Mirko Marjanovic struck a defiant tone as he vowed
NATO troops would never be allowed into Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO renewed threats of air strikes against Belgrade if
President Slobodan Milosevic continued to maintain his forces in
Kosovo. Troops under Milosevic have been blamed for a massacres and
violence against the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 months of fighting there &UR;  &LR; have left 2,000 people dead and
thousands homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said if a peace pact is agreed upon, ``We are seriously
considering the possibility of our participation'' in a NATO
peacekeeping operation. ``No decision has been reached,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In briefings to a skeptical Congress on Wednesday, Pentagon
officials said the United States could provide 2,000 to 4,000
troops as part of a NATO force of 20,000 to 30,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, is one of several members of
Congress opposed to ground troops in Kosovo because of an unclear
game plan by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison, an outspoken critic of the administration's Balkan
policy, was one of the members briefed by officials as they sought
to rally Capital Hill support for a possible NATO mission.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton outlined four conditions for U.S. participation: A
strong and effective peace agreement, a demonstrated commitment to
implementing a peace agreement by the parties, the withdrawal of
Serbian security forces and weapons restrictions on Kosovo's
Albanians and a well-defined NATO mission with a clear exit
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our European allies and partners will have to contribute a
substantial majority of the troops but NATO is a partnership and
they have a right to expect the United States, which has been a
leader of NATO for 50 years now, to be a part of that,'' Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said in another speech
that the U.S. contribution to ground forces ``will be no more than
several thousand troops.'' Albright also warned Milosevic that ``he
can expect airstrikes'' if his forces continue their violence
against the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   A peace plan proposal by the United States, Europe and Russia
would give the ethnic Albanians autonomy, but not independence, for
three to five years. Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of
Kosovo's population, but the region also contains many of the
Serbian religious landmarks that make it unlikely the province
would be surrendered peacefully.
</P>
<P>
   The rebellion there marks the continuation of factional fighting
that has been under way since Communism fell in Yugoslavia. Violent
ethnic slaughters marked the independence of Bosnia as ethnic
Serbs, supported by Milosovic, warred with Muslims and Croats in
that region through much of this decade. Unlike Bosnia, Kosovo
remained a part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called the fighting in Kosovo the ``biggest remaining
danger'' to peace and stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Balkans are an explosive area. They touch on difficult
areas. And unless we can contain, and ultimately defuse, the ethnic
hatreds in that region, they could embroil us, ultimately, in a
much larger conflict with much more human loss,'' Clinton told an
audience at a downtown hotel here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he feared if the factional fighting continued, he
could draw in neighboring nations such as Albania and Macedonia
and, potentially, NATO's fractious allies, Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, if this conflict continues we'll see another
massive humanitarian crisis; there will be more atrocities, more
refugees crossing borders, more people crying out for justice and
more people seeking revenge,'' Clinton told an audience on hand for
the Malcolm Baldrige Quality Awards ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cited the United States' military role in Bosnia as an
example of how the nation can help maintain peace in Eastern
Europe. Three years ago, the United States sent 28,000 troops into
Bosnia to help maintain the Dayton Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton initially said the U.S. troops, part of larger NATO
mission, would be withdrawn after one year. However, 7,000 troops
remain there now indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the peace process has taken hold,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also sent a message to the Serbs and the ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Kosovar Albanians, I'd like to say that this is a
chance not just to stop your people from getting killed but to take
control of your destiny, where your rights, your faith and your
culture are respected, and you have the autonomy you have been
promised by law,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the Serbs, this is a chance to prove Kosovo can remain
part of your country while regaining its autonomy and peace. For
the people of both communities, this is a chance to stop wasting
your energies and your lives on a useless war and to start
conserving them for building a more open and prosperous future for
your children,'' Clinton said.

GOV. PATAKI STARTS NATIONAL TOUR TO TEST PRESIDENTIAL PROSPECTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARA JAKES and JOHN CAHER +
 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ New York Gov. George Pataki embarks Friday on the
first of several cross-country political trips, raising his
national visibility and possibly testing the waters for a
presidential run.
</P>
<P>
   He travels first to Chicago and, later this month, will visit
Miami and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki has not yet said he will run for national office,
he has also not discouraged speculation that he wants to be
considered as a presidential or vice presidential contender for
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Already, other GOP hopefuls _ including Arizona Sen. John McCain
and former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander _ are flocking to New
Hampshire to prepare for primaries there early next year. For now,
Pataki will forego the snow-shoveling photo-ops in New Hampshire,
while heading to more seasonally moderate climates in the South and
the Midwest to warm up to some of the nation's most powerful
grass-roots leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going to get a sense of how he's going to play out here
in the Midwest, there isn't any better place to try it,'' said
Hillard Selck, the national Republican committeeman from Missouri,
who asked Pataki to speak at his state's annual Lincoln Day dinner
on Feb. 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be willing to tell our neighboring states if he sold
like hotcakes in Missouri,'' Selck said Thursday. ``Then the guys
around us would know about it: Kansas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Arkansas.
That's such a nice little swatch of states out here to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who recently formed two national political action
committees to finance his out-of-state travel and to aid other
Republicans, appeared Thursday on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show and
Pataki criticized his party's Washington leadership for dwelling on
the Monica Lewinsky scandal and giving short shrift to local
interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost have two different Republican parties,'' Pataki
said. ``You have the Washington party and then you have the
states.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said the GOP, to prevail in 2000, must develop a positive
message spotlighting lower taxes and less government.
</P>
<P>
   One of his themes is that Republican governors should get more
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1996, Republican governors really took a back seat,''
Pataki said. ``It was largely a Washington national convention and
ticket. We shouldn't do that for 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   His trip to Chicago, where the governor will venture to the
bedrock of conservative, free-market economics _ the University of
Chicago _ marks Pataki's first major out-of-state appearance since
forming the national PACs. The speech is sponsored by the
conservative Federalist Society.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released Thursday by Quinnipiac College shows that while
Pataki remains highly popular in New York, he has almost no support
as a presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``New Yorkers like their governor _ in Albany,'' said Maurice
``Mickey'' Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute. ``He doesn't add much to a national ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor is not being paid for any of the upcoming speeches
in Chicago, Missouri or Florida, according to spokesman Michael
McKeon. But the appearances may be worth their weight in gold. At
least, that's what Pataki's political advisers are hoping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose I was looking for the proverbial New York City
slicker, but I found that he speaks a language that the people of
Missouri would find very acceptable,'' said Selck, who heard Pataki
speak recently in Manhattan. He invited the governor to the Show-Me
State shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found myself immensely impressed with Gov. Pataki _ I think
he does a whale of a job.''

HARVARD CLASS HAS SESSION WITH FIRED JAMA EDITOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY TYE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ The catalog promised that the course would
zero in on ``timely health policy controversies,'' but the 17 or so
Harvard students who had signed up could not have anticipated just
how timely it would be. Or how they'd have a front-row seat in the
hottest policy/personality controversy in the world of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   That's because one of the two professors is Dr. George D.
Lundberg who, just before he began his teaching duties this week at
Harvard's School of Public Health, was fired as the top-ranking
editor at the Journal of the American Medical Association. His
termination set off a firestorm of protest from doctors and medical
editors from Sweden to Britain and Australia to North America.
</P>
<P>
   All of which, say his students, makes for a compelling backdrop
to a course on the inner workings of medical and scientific
journals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been stressing a lot the separation between owners and
editors, how important that is if you want to maintain
credibility,'' Hannah Cooper, a doctoral student, said after
Thursday's class. ``We have a real-life example of what happens
when owners do insert themselves and control the editorial life of
a journal. Having that played out in front of us really is
instructive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nawal Nour, an obstetrician who's working on her master's in
public health, agreed: `I had planned to take this class anyway
because I'm very interested in publishing, but this adds another
dimension about the political aspects of publishing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the sense he'd been warned that there were
controversial issues out there, and not to touch them, but he was
willing to take the risk. . . . He was willing to sacrifice his
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex and presidential politics were the immediate issues that
last month cost Lundberg his post as editor of the Journal of the
American Medical Association. He published a story on college
students's attitudes on sex that seemed to support President
Clinton's controversial contention that oral-genital contact alone
does not constitute ``having sex.'' The AMA bosses, who already
were losing patience with their blunt-spoken editor, said the sex
story ``inappropriately and inexcusably'' inserted JAMA into the
impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   After weeks of angry exchanges between the AMA and Lundberg's
defenders, the AMA and Lundberg on Wednesday announced a cease-fire
and what apparently was a generous financial settlement. Thursday
Lundberg, who was wearing a white sling to protect a fractured
elbow, declined to say anything about the settlement or the AMA,
although he and his lawyer have made clear that the editor will
hold his tongue only through the end of next week, and only for
legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   His students, however, say he hasn't hesitated to air his views
in class. ``A lot of times you hear his quotes in the press,'' said
Nour, ``but you lose the essence of his humanness. We have seen
that this is a person who has values and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's class, she added, Lundberg spent 15 minutes
discussing issues of editorial freedom and integrity, which he says
are at the center of his firing by the AMA. The association insists
the firing had more to do with Lundberg's overstepped reasonable
bounds of behavior, and it has vowed to maintain JAMA's
independence as it conducts an international search for Lundberg's
successor.
</P>
<P>
   But the ongoing JAMA controversy isn't of interest to everyone
in the Harvard class, which is titled ``How to Write, Peer Review
and Publish Articles on Medicine and Health Policy,'' and is
co-taught by health policy expert Karen Donelan. ``I wasn't even
aware of the controversy until two days ago,'' said Robert Krasner,
a professor of microbiology at Providence College who is studying
at Harvard during his sabbatical.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's irrelevant to whatever this course is.''

MOUSE GENE GIVES RESEARCHERS DIABETES CLUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Researchers say they have found a single cellular
glitch that causes adult onset diabetes, the most common form of
the metabolic disease that affects nearly 16 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Using mice with a knocked-out gene that triggered a condition
resembling human diabetes, the Joslin Diabetes Center researchers
say they have homed in on the underlying reason why diabetics'
pancreatic cells do not secrete enough insulin and, at the same
time, why the body's organs lose the ability to respond to insulin.
</P>
<P>
   Finding this root cause of the disease could lead to improved
treatments, said Dr. Ronald Kahn, researcher, director of the
Joslin center, and an author of the paper in the current issue of
the journal Cell.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of this in terms of treatment is that it opens
up a whole new avenue of possibilities of what to do'' to restore a
normal insulin balance in adult-onset diabetics, said Kahn in an
interview. One new aim, he said, would be to devise drugs that
restore cells' sensitivity to insulin, the hormone that regulates
the level of sugar in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   In general, diabetes results from too little insulin, which
enables the body to metabolize sugar and convert it to energy. With
too little insulin, sugar backs up into the bloodstream and can
damage vital organs like the heart, kidney and eyes.
</P>
<P>
   In Type I (juvenile) diabetes, the insulin-producing beta cells
of the pancreas simply stop producing insulin, and patients have to
take insulin in daily injections.
</P>
<P>
   In Type II (adult onset) diabetes, which accounts for 90 to 95
percent of all cases of diabetes, the problem is not so simple. On
one hand, tissues like the liver, fat and muscle become
``insulin-resistant'' _ the hormone doesn't work on them to
metabolize sugar properly. In addition, the beta cells cut back on
secretion of insulin. Until now, researchers thought these were two
separate abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has always been the question of which came first, the
chicken or the egg,'' commented Joan Harmon, a senior advisor for
diabetes at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases. ``Was there a basic defect in the beta cell that
causes lack of insulin secretion, or is the real problem the
development of insulin resistance'' in body organs?
</P>
<P>
   The Joslin researchers' study suggests that both are caused by
the same problem: the beta cell itself becomes resistant to insulin
(produced by it or by other beta cells) and can't respond to sugar
in the blood, and at the same time it cuts back on producing
insulin. The development of insulin resistance in the beta cells is
apparently analagous to the development of such resistance in
distant tissues and organs, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really says that this insulin-sensing problem in the beta
cell could be the major cause of Type II diabetes,'' said Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon at the NIDDKD said the paper ``will cause a lot of
discussion'' and provides ``interesting new directions for
treatment'' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need to look for now is an oral agent to make the beta
cell more sensitive to insulin,'' said Kahn. ``Then we could
reverse one of the most important defects'' causing diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers made their discovery by breeding mice that
lacked a key gene in the insulin-sensing system of the pancreatic
beta cell. Without it, the cells failed to produce enough insulin
and also became insensitive to insulin, and the animals developed
symptoms similar to human diabetes.

HARVARD CLUB TO TAKE LEGAL ACTION IN ALLEGED THEFT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (i and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The Harvard Alumni Club of Hong Kong voted Thursday
to pursue legal action against its former president, whom club
members accuse of stealing $504,000 from club funds and donations.
</P>
<P>
   Between November 1996 and October 1997, Stephen Wai-wan Chik
allegedly transferred into his personal accounts a donation meant
for the university as well as club monies as payment for
``professional and secretarial services,'' according to financial
documents reviewed by club auditors and attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Chik, a 1986 graduate, has returned 80 percent of the funds. But
members present _ 38 out of a membership of 300 _ voted
overwhelmingly to sue him for the remainder, and to turn
information over to police for a possible criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The move to hold him accountable will send waves through the
city's elite, since the dynamic young financier was once a darling
of senior alumni in finance and government.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sense, the vote marks a new beginning for the club, a
chance to redeem the group's name and recover from accusations that
a tight circle of powerful alumni stalled the investigation to
protect Chik and Harvard's name.
</P>
<P>
   Although nearly all present voted to take legal action, several
people had reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's very practical, because I don't think
there's a good chance of recovering money. . . . Any legal action
takes money and we open ourselves to the possibility that if we
lose, we pay his costs,'' said Reuben Mondejar, who holds a 1988
master's degree in international studies.
</P>
<P>
   The club's executive committee set aside $26,000 last November
for legal fees, and a large chunk has already been spent consulting
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, said Mondejar, who served as vice president under
Chik, ``I think the members have spoken and I think it's a good
thing. There were views expressed before . . . that the executive
committee was taking decisions without consulting members, so this
was a chance to consult them. It can be seen as a cleansing of the
club.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated efforts to reach Chik for comment were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Weaver, a 1995 Harvard Law School graduate, said: ``It's a
hard call any time you have to decide on litigation. But I think
there are reasons beyond money. There are moral reasons, and I
think people took those into account.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Weldon, a 1959 Harvard graduate who works as a consultant,
said he ``absolutely'' agrees with the vote, because it underlines
respect for law. ``Here we are in Hong Kong worrying about whether
China will allow Hong Kong to exist with the rule of law, and I
don't think we've been following it ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Weldon said that the club and its foundation did not undergo
annual audits, as required by club bylaws and Hong Kong law.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina Fang, a 1988 graduate and a lawyer, said another member
recounted a story at the meeting of a business associate who called
looking for a reference check on Chik, to whom he had already lent
$2 million. When the businessman learned that the club believed
Chik had taken club funds, he questioned why the club had not
publicized it to warn others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Citizens have an obligation to report crimes _ it seems so
obvious,'' said Fang, who joined other members at the fashionable
China Club Thursday to review documents and get briefed by a lawyer
before voting.
</P>
<P>
   Members voted not to pursue action against former treasurer Yun
Ed Wong, holder of a 1989 Harvard PhD in geophysics, who signed
blank transfer notes that Chik allegedly used to siphon club funds.
Wong, who was an employee of Chik's at the time, gave a speech at
the meeting saying he was ``a victim'' like everyone else and that
he ``trusted (Chik) as a friend and as a fellow Harvard man.''
</P>
<P>
   Chik, who served as president for four years, did not attend the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Wong said he was relieved the club was not
holding him responsible, and said he would cooperate with police.
Wong defended himself against accusations by some members that he
put his friendship and trust of a fellow alumnus over his fiduciary
responsiblity to the rest of the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even before me, all the bank statements went straight to the
president,'' Wong said. ``I suppose I could have started a new
trend, but I didn't.''

PATRIOTS SEEK ASSURANCES ON NEW STADIUM SITE

<P>
   BOSTON _ Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland and New England
Patriots owner Robert Kraft have scheduled a news conference for
Friday in Hartford, but it is unclear if a development agreement
that will legally seal the team's move there will be ready to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Patriots were pressing for assurances that the
site of a proposed new stadium in downtown Hartford will be cleared
in time for the team to play its first game by the fall of 2002.
But those guarantees were still being hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of the discussions have been relentless,'' said team
vice president Andy Wasynczuk. ``We've been working `round the
clock, the attorneys have been working 22-hour days to complete the
documentation and we're moving ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland moved swiftly this week to allay growing fears among
team officials that a breakdown in negotiations to move a steam
plant on the proposed stadium site could endanger the construction
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Just how the governor's office would compensate or assure the
Patriots that the site will be clear by the summer of 2000, so that
construction on the $350 million project can begin, remained
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is if we frame the agreement, we've got to be
comfortable,'' Wasynczuk said. ``It's implicit we're moving forward
with something we're comfortable signing.''
</P>
<P>
   The press conference is scheduled for 2 p.m. in the Old
Judiciary Room of the state Capitol, the same place where Rowland
and Kraft signed a Memorandum of Understanding Nov. 19 to move the
team from Foxborough to a site along the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   But a steam plant that provides service to much of downtown
occupies that location and must be moved in order for the stadium
-- and the larger $1 billion redevelopment project known as
Adriaen's Landing -- to be built.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state has not reached an agreement with the steam
plant company, CTG Resources Inc., it appears that the development
agreement will give negotiators more time to find a way to tear
down the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thursday, consumer activist Ralph Nader stepped up
his campaign to derail the Patriots deal. In a letter sent to the
governor's office, Nader predicted the deal will not go forward and
warned Rowland to include sufficient ``escape clauses'' for state
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mounting and multiple forces and problems from many
directions that are confronting this deal will result in the
stadium never being built,'' Nader wrote. ``Here's hoping you will
turn your attention to the state's real needs...''

COMMENTARY: A BALKAN SOLUTION  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANDERSTOLEN, Norway _ Stop. Before we dive into sending
American troops to sort out the Serbian-Albanian civil war in
Kosovo, could we talk about this for a second? If ever there was a
time for an honest reassessment of U.S. policy toward Bosnia and
Kosovo, it's now. And what that reassessment would conclude is that
we should redo the Dayton accords _ otherwise we're going to end up
with U.S. troops in Bosnia and Kosovo forever, without solving
either problem.
</P>
<P>
   Take it from someone who knows, Lord David Owen, the former
British foreign secretary who also served as the E.U.'s special
negotiator for Bosnia, 1992-95. Lord Owen shared his innovative
idea for dealing with the Bosnia-Kosovo crises at a seminar here.
It goes like this:
</P>
<P>
   Point 1. Let's recognize how we got ourselves tied up in knots
in Bosnia. The major powers, argued Lord Owen, refused to consider
any solution in Yugoslavia that involved changing international
borders, for fear that such a solution would trigger an explosion
of new ethnic states in the former Soviet Union. So when Yugoslavia
collapsed in the early '90s into its regional statelets _ Serbia,
Montenegro, Croatia, Slovenia, Macedonia and Bosnia _ the West
insisted that these regional boundaries become the new, unchanging
international boundaries. The result, in the case of Bosnia, was
that a good number of Serbs, Croats and Muslims were trapped into
living together, even though a significant number of them didn't
want to.
</P>
<P>
   Point 2. The Dayton accords tried to get around this by dividing
Bosnia into semi-autonomous sub-regions _ 49 percent going to the
Bosnian Serbs and 51 percent to a Muslim-Croatian Federation _ but
then tying them together under a single, central government. This
kept Bosnia's borders intact. But some of the people inside still
hate each other, and peace can be maintained only by keeping U.S.
and NATO troops there. To think that Bosnia today is a
self-sustaining multi-ethnic state is pure fantasy. Still, there
has been some progress. The Serbs of Bosnia are now divided; those
living around Pale want absolutely nothing to do with a
multi-ethnic Bosnian state, but more moderate Serbs living around
Banja Luka are increasingly ready to live in Bosnia under a
Muslim-led government.
</P>
<P>
   Point 3. Kosovo is a province of Serbia (which is next to
Bosnia) and is 94 percent Albanian. The Kosovo Albanians had
autonomy inside Serbia, but in the wake of all the killings between
Serbs and Kosovars, the Kosovo Albanians are now demanding
independence. Said Lord Owen: ``There is no way that Serb President
Slobodan Milosevic will grant Kosovo independence, even if there is
a referendum, and, at this stage, there is no way the Kosovars will
settle for anything less. Trying to impose autonomy on Kosovo is
like trying to push water uphill.'' But that is exactly what the
peace talks this weekend in Rambouillet, France, will try to do.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, adds Lord Owen, ``It's time to drop our reservations
about redrawing international borders and to have a Balkan solution
for a Balkan problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Point 4. That solution would be to acknowledge that two
communities want out of the states they are now stuck in. The Pale
Serbs want out of Bosnia, so they can join Serbia, and the Kosovo
Albanians want out of Serbia, so they can be independent.
Therefore, argues Lord Owen, ``let's go to Milosevic and say, every
square mile of Kosovo you are ready to give up and turn over to the
Kosovar Albanians, we will give you in return the same amount of
square miles around Pale, which you can then annex to Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   You could solve several problems at once: With the Pale Serbs
out of Bosnia (and with some pressure on the Croats there to be
more supportive of the Muslim-led government) you would greatly
increase the chances that the remaining Serbs, Muslims and Croats
in Bosnia could live together _ without foreign troops. Moreover,
by giving Pale to Milosevic you compensate him and the Serbs for
letting Kosovo go, and therefore you increase the chances that the
Kosovo problem can be solved without foreign troops or endless
bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   The only way U.S. and NATO troops are going to get out of the
Balkans, and stay out, is if a majority of people there are living
where and with whom they want. You want to keep the borders fixed?
Fine. Then at least acknowledge that U.S. and NATO troops will have
to sit on the factions living inside these fixed borders forever.
And that's a long time.

   The timing was magnificent. As Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright was crisscrossing the Middle East to round up support for
the Clinton administration's policy of helping the Iraqi opposition
overthrow Saddam Hussein, the American general commanding U.S.
forces in the Mideast was once again proclaiming that the idea
stinks.  &QL;

<P>
   Magnificent, that is, for Saddam. In one winter, first he
destroys the U.N. arms inspection commission. Then he surges ahead
in the Mideast political war eight years after he lost the military
war to U.S.-led forces. And now, unexpected dessert, along comes
the United States to prove it did not have either a policy to deal
with his resurgence or a president who could command a commander.  &QL;

<P>
   It must be delectable humor for Saddam to listen to Gen. Anthony
Zinni, the Marine Corps commander, the ranking U.S. general in the
Mideast, repeatedly put down the Clinton administration by saying
that a ``weak, chaotic and fragmented'' Iraq is more dangerous than
a contained Iraq, and totally dismiss any viable Iraqi opposition.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Saddam to wonder which policy, if any, Washington
would use to try to deal with Iraq, and which American, if any, is
in charge.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The last time Saddam misunderstood what a U.S. message was
trying to tell him was about invading Kuwait. He guessed wrong,
invaded and created a war that still bedevils and threatens the
United States, Israel and other targets for the mass-death weapons
that are his paramount goal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Imagine all the mixed signals U.S. officials concede he is
getting now. Imagine the lives Saddam can take if he picks a signal
that convinces him that America's government is so muddled and
divided that he can strike again.
</P>
<P>
   Zinni has said some things that are true _ helping dissidents
would be dangerous and difficult. But he has not come up with a
solution that would be neither. He has said half-truths _ such as
that the opposition is not viable. That is true now, because the
United States let Saddam slaughter the opposition and the
administration is still talking, not giving, real help to rebuild
opposition forces. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Zinni claim that a weak, fragmented Iraq, presumably after
rebellion, is more dangerous in the long run than a contained
Saddam is now is not information. It is opinion that much of the
administration rejects. But in America, those are judgments to be
made by the civilian powers of government, not the military.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of Saddam might give Iraqi opposition minorities
some of their lands to live in, with a taste of freedom _ but the
horror of it all escapes me.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department is said by a determinedly anonymous
official to disagree with the general, and finds his comments
neither helpful or pleasing.
</P>
<P>
   One way for the administration to deal with his persistent
public denigrating of administration planning, what there is of it,
is to use presidential power _ fire him as quickly as Harry Truman
fired Gen. Douglas MacArthur for cutting across presidential policy
in Korea. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That might convince Saddam, our enemies and our occasional
allies at the U.N. that the U.S. is still brain-alive about the
Iraqi danger and perhaps capable of creating a united policy to
deal with it.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department minimizes the differences between the
general and the civilian departments, and points out that he is a
highly valuable officer. And Zinni is not the imperious MacArthur.
But it is hard to see how he can lead in the field a policy he has
put down in public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What about the general's own rights? If the president does not
want to remove him, can the government decently reduce his ability
to speak his mind on policy dangers he may see? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes. Zinni chose a career that does control that right and often
reduces it _ in public. In private government meetings, civilian,
military or mixed, he has the duty to speak fully. Before
congressional committees, he can request private sessions on
matters he thinks might damage American interests, which some of
his comments do. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If stifling some of his opinions in public damages his own sense
of duty, he has an honorable way out, too little chosen by U.S.
officials. He can resign and speak up. That should satisfy his own
sense of duty _ and not confuse the Iraqis into another disaster
for them and the countries Saddam stalks.

 &HT;    Experiencing the agony of Sierra Leone
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS, MAP
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Milton Boyle just wanted to return home, set up a
commercial fishing business and give something back to the country
of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone has endured its share of turmoil in recent years,
but Boyle, who lives in Jonesboro, Ga., had read the news and
searched the Internet for information. Things were under control.
Freetown was safe.
</P>
<P>
   So he took his annual Christmas trip back to Sierra Leone,
intending this time to move home for good. His sister, Elizabeth
Toure, followed five days later, bringing her three children _ two
girls and a boy ranging from 11 years old to 15 months.
</P>
<P>
   But on Jan. 6, rebel fighters invaded the capital and all hell
broke loose. Boyle spent four days pinned down in his house. He
barely escaped alive, and the things he saw _ the killings, the
mutilations, the burning buildings _ haunt him even now.
</P>
<P>
   And his sister and her children are stuck in Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone, on Africa's west coast, is less than half the size
of Georgia and has about 4.7 million people.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of Africa's smallest countries _ with far less area
and far fewer people than Sudan, Nigeria, the Democratic Republic
of Congo, South Africa, Angola, Kenya or Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   But the humanitarian disaster unfolding in Sierra Leone ranks
among the most severe in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the country's finance minister, James Jonah, accused
the U.N. Security Council of focusing on massacres in Yugoslavia's
Kosovo province while virtually ignoring the brutal killings in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 people have been killed in a year of fighting
between Albanian separatist guerrillas and Yugoslav forces in
Kosovo. In Sierra Leone, in just the last two months since rebels
renewed their offensive, between 2,000 and 3,000 people have been
killed. Many more have had their hands and feet cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe it is time for the international community and the
Security Council to be more evenhanded in dealing with this
crisis,'' said Jonah. ``You cannot deal with atrocities in Kosovo
and not deal with them in Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonah is not alone in his assessment. In an essay published last
month in the Washington Post, Reynold Levy, president of the
International Refugee Rescue Committee wrote: ``Today, Sierra Leone
has become the world's largest producer of human misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Levy cited U.N. estimates that 440,000 Sierra Leoneans _ nearly
10 percent of the population _ have fled across the border into
Liberia or Guinea. Rape and kidnapping, he said, have become
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels have committed ``barbaric reprisals'' against supporters
of the elected government, Levy wrote: ``The guerrillas have, for
example, burned villagers alive _ not only men, but women and
children. And they've made an example of others by hacking off
their hands or arms, their feet or legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One such victim, a 6-year-old called Flora, held up her
bandaged arm and asked my colleague, Marie de la Soudiere, `Will my
fingers grow back?'''
</P>
<P>
   Civil war has laid waste to Sierra Leone for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1997, bands of former Sierra Leonean troops _ backed by
the nearby countries of Liberia and Burkina Faso, according to many
accounts _ seized power from the elected president, Ahmad Tejan
Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly a year later, in March 1998, Kabbah was reinstated by
a Nigerian-led military force known as ECOMOG. The rebels fled.
Nigeria kept about 15,000 troops in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Against that background, and based on news accounts, Boyle, a
37-year-old businessman who had lived in the Atlanta area for seven
years, decided the time was right to move back to Sierra Leone. His
sister, who had come to the Atlanta area in 1997 to escape the
turmoil and give birth to her third child, would move back, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all went back thinking everything was calm,'' Boyle said in
a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle left Atlanta on Dec. 10. His sister, with her three
children _ Melissa, 11, Marissa, 8, and 15-month-old Michelle _
departed five days later.
</P>
<P>
   At first, everything was fine. Boyle stayed in a house in
Freetown that he owns with a cousin. But listening to BBC radio
reports unsettled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We heard that the rebels were 22 miles away,'' Boyle said.
``So it was very disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 6, the rebels entered Freetown.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys came in and started killing people by the dozens,''
Boyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Cowering in his house, Boyle heard people scream for their
lives. Out the windows, he saw 14-year-olds carrying AK-47 assault
rifles, cans of gasoline and RPGs _ shoulder-fired,
rocket-propelled grenade launchers. He saw buildings set aflame,
and people corralled and used as human shields to prevent the
Nigerian forces from firing.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle could not leave the house _ not to buy food, not to
escape, not even to check on his sister and her children, who were
staying in a house two miles away, and whose phone had been cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the floor, primarily, for five days, eating boiled
bananas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, chaos reigned.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mohammed Luqman, an emergency expert for the
Atlanta-based relief agency CARE, the fighting and the torching of
homes forced 150,000 residents from their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 9, three reporters were killed. One was abducted from
his home, taken to a rebel base, and shot in the head in front of
his fiancee, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect
Journalists. Another reporter survived after having his eye gouged
out with a machete.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 10, three journalists with Associated Press Television
News were driving through Freetown, escorted by ECOMOG troops when
rebel fighters approached the vehicle and opened fire. Two of the
journalists were hit in the head. One died immediately; the other
was flown to London, where his condition is reported to be
improving.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' entry into Freetown alarmed Sierra Leoneans living
in the Atlanta area. Feeling that strength lay in unity, three
pro-democracy groups merged into one, Patriots and Friends of
Sierra Leone. One of the group's leaders, Amadu Jabbie of
Jonesboro, estimated that 8,000 Sierra Leoneans live in the Atlanta
area, although the country's honorary consul in Atlanta suggested
that figure was high and an independent estimate has been
impossible to obtain.
</P>
<P>
   In Freetown on Jan. 11, Boyle's cousin, a businessman with
friends among the Nigerian soldiers, managed to get word to the
soldiers that he and Boyle needed help. About 18 soldiers arrived
in a military vehicle and picked up Boyle and his cousin. There was
no way to get to his sister.
</P>
<P>
   On the ride to the barracks, perhaps a mile and a half down
Wilkinson Road, a main thoroughfare through the affluent west side
of Freetown, Boyle saw scores of bodies along the road. Some had
limbs cut off. Others had been decapitated. Vultures feasted on the
dead.
</P>
<P>
   From the barracks, Boyle was helicoptered to Lungi airport
outside the capital, and from there he flew to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians _ and President Kabbah _ remain nominally in
control of Freetown. But the capital has been devastated. On
Tuesday, CARE began feeding nearly 7,000 people in a badly damaged
eastern section of the city. Food is scarce, and two taps must
provide water for all of them, said CARE Country Director Nick
Webber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whole blocks have been totally destroyed, including
stone-structured churches and concrete buildings,'' Webber said.
``The streets are lined with burned vehicles, one after another,
while other houses are intact.''
</P>
<P>
   And this week, hundreds of Sierra Leoneans, fearful that the
Nigerians will pull out and leave them unprotected, have lined up
to get passports or have crowded onto boats and helicopters trying
to find a way out.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, a boat full of refugees fleeing Freetown hit a
rock near the Guinea border and sank, killing 50 people.
</P>
<P>
   Boyle has heard through a relative that his sister and her
children are safe, but he is still trying to get them out. He has
always made an annual Christmas visit to Sierra Leone, but will he
go back?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not any time soon,'' he said.

EURO WEAKENS AGAINST THE DOLLAR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
   LONDON _ Hurt by fears of an economic slowdown across Europe in
the face of expansive growth in the United States, the month-old
European single currency touched a low against the dollar Thursday
as a series of interest-rate decisions reinforced forecasts that
European rates would keep falling.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Resisting political pressures to lower rates, the European
Central Bank, custodian of the monetary policy of the 11 member
nations in the euro zone, left its key interest rate unchanged
Thursday at 3 percent. But there was still widespread expectation
that the rate could be lowered a few times in coming months, said
Michael Saunders, an economist with Salomon Smith Barney. The
anticipation of lower rates was one reason the euro declined
against the dollar in European dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the euro zone, the Bank of England surprised the markets
with a bigger-than-expected cut of half a percentage point in its
key short-term lending rate, bringing it to 5.5 percent, the lowest
in almost five years. Dealers had expected a quarter-point
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's monetary policy committee, which is trying to keep
British inflation from exceeding 2.5 percent, said the reduction in
the securities repurchase had been dictated by ``the prospects for
international activity and prices, domestic costs and consumer
demand.'' It was the fifth consecutive reduction, reflecting
concerns that Britain's slowing economy could be headed toward
recession.
</P>
<P>
   British rates now have fallen by two percentage points since
October. The country's economic slowdown has been caused in part by
a strong pound, which has diminished exports and reduced consumer
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark, another euro outsider, also reduced its discount and
repurchase rates by a quarter-point Thursday, though for different
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Danish currency, the krone, is formally linked to the euro
in an exchange-rate mechanism that is supposed to limit the
currency's fluctuations. The Danish central bank said its rate
reduction, the seventh since October, was made because of the
krone's growing strength against the euro. The move had been
expected.
</P>
<P>
   The European decisions came a day after the Federal Reserve's
policy-making committee decided to leave rates in the United States
unchanged after data last week showing the strongest American
economic growth in two years. By contrast, the European Commission
said last month that its earlier forecast of 2.4 percent growth in
continental Europe this year would have to be trimmed back. The
commission, the day-to-day executive arm of the European Union, has
not yet published a new forecast.
</P>
<P>
   The interest-rate decisions illuminated not just the disparities
between American and European growth, but also the distinctions
between Britain and Continental Europe that, British officials
maintain, preclude participation in the euro currency system for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   While the euro zone's benchmark interest rate remained at 3
percent, British rates are still the highest among the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations. At its debut on financial markets
Jan. 4, the euro traded above $1.18, but Thursday it was driven
down in European markets to lows near $1.125 _ a fall around 5
percent from the euphoria of its first days, when investors seeking
to build up euro positions sold dollars to buy the new currency. In
New York later, the euro improved somewhat, settling at $1.1344.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sentiment on the euro has turned very gloomy,'' said Kit
Juckes of NatWest Global Financial Markets.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
KARL Malone has had a change of heart.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Make that another change of heart. Come to think of it, Malone
changes his mind more than wrestling partner Dennis Rodman changes
his hair color.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone swears he is serious this time.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago he vowed to never again play for the Utah Jazz,
saying he didn't like the way he was treated by the organization.
But after a tearful press conference where he apologized to the
fans and to owner Larry Miller, Malone is back, and claims that he
has his eyes fixed on winning the NBA championship that has escaped
his grasp the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted to win a championship, and the Utah Jazz
have a great shot this year,'' he said. ``I have to be a part of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time this summer when a lot of people were doubting
that. Malone, once one of the last of the NBA's rugged
individualists, started acting well, for lack of a better word,
wacky.
</P>
<P>
   His act became disturbingly like that of Dennis Rodman, long his
nemesis on the court. Malone switched agents, hiring Dwight Manley,
the same guy who was representing Rodman at the time, and started a
wrestling career, appearing in pay-per-view World Championship
Wrestling events.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone says all that is in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I ever wrestle again? Probably not,'' he said. ``That's
something that I just wanted to do, and I did it. I don't have any
regrets, but now it's time to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Jazz must be thankful that Malone came to his
senses. While Malone was wrestling with both Rodman and the Utah
fans, the rest of the Jazz players were going through their paces
every day of the lockout in team workouts. While the Indiana Pacers
have received a lot of attention for their team workouts, the Jazz
_ sans Malone _ did pretty much the same thing, doing full-scale
team workouts to keep sharp and attempt to get a head start on the
rest of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of guys here for a lot of days, but we've also
had a mixture of other guys from other teams coming and playing,''
said guard John Stockton. ``It made for good basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we have a great jump on everyone else, but
hopefully everyone is in condition because of this.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys who have been playing together, obviously we know one
another, we know the offense, we know what (coach) Jerry (Sloan)
expects,'' said Greg Foster, who broke a bone in his foot and will
miss three weeks. ``It will be interesting to see just how long (it
takes to start playing well together). I don't think it will take
long.''
</P>
<P>
   It had better not.
</P>
<P>
   While the Jazz should expect to roll from the start because they
are a veteran team with their nucleus intact, they know most of
their toughest competitors in the Western Conference have gotten
much stronger. The Rockets got Scottie Pippen to go with Hakeem
Olajuwon, and the Spurs addressed their needs by getting Steve
Kerr's outside shooting and Mario Elie to address their toughness.
And the Lakers are still looking to make moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very good players, but we still have to see how they
blend in with those particular teams,'' said Utah guard Howard
Eisley. ``But right now we really can't worry about other teams. We
have to make sure we're together with what we want to do and make
sure we're hitting on all cylinders when it's time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   While Malone missed out on the pickup games (all that wrestling
doesn't leave much time for basketball), he says it's time to get
back to work. A rough summer _ trade demands, news that he had
teen-aged twins back in Louisiana that he had never acknowledged,
etc. _ had Malone reflecting on just how good things are in his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the stuff that's gone on this summer, I've had to
grow up quick,'' the 35-year-old Malone said. ``Dealing with all
this negative stuff makes you think about things in a different
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to be more careful with what I do and say, I realize
that. Some things can be distracting, and I got a lot of that out
of the way. I'm ready to just play basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloan knows that Malone will be there when the ball is tossed up
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Karl's always ready to play. That's never in doubt with him,''
Sloan said. ``He did what he had to do this summer, but he made
sure he was ready to compete when it was time to get back on the
court.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
IF you're just tuning in for the NBA season, you haven't missed a
thing.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But if you blink from here on out, you might miss plenty.
</P>
<P>
   February usually represents the dog days in the NBA _ basketball
on Prozac. Players, tired of the grind, often simply go through the
motions, not yet able to smell the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But this season will be more like the NBA on caffeine.
</P>
<P>
   The new season, one full of changes, begins Friday, more than
three months late. And the compressed post-lockout 50-game schedule
will look more like a barnstorming tour, with teams playing three
straight nights on some occasions. Players will be getting to know
teammates on the fly, leading to some uh, interesting games.
</P>
<P>
   But the season that almost wasn't will wind up being one for the
books, one full of changes. There will be no All-Star Game, and, in
part to make up for just that kind of thing, teams are playing for
free in the preseason and doing marathon autograph sessions
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were sensitive to closing up the wide gap between players
and fans,'' said NBA commissioner David Stern. ``The (players')
union and the league felt it was time for the players to stress
responsibility and commitment to their teams and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching the players the past few weeks has been as
encouraging as watching the fans' reaction to the open scrimmages.
I suppose the fair question to ask us is, `What took you so long?'
Well, we knew this issue was coming and we've tried to take care of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change is obvious _ the Bulls aren't the favorite to
win the NBA championship. Michael Jordan has retired, Scottie
Pippen is in Houston, Dennis Rodman is well, who cares? And Phil
Jackson is probably in a tepee somewhere, writing haiku poetry and
contemplating life without the aforementioned trio.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, things are going to be different this season.
</P>
<P>
   How different? Try this _ with such a short season, every game
will mean something.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 50 games, it's kind of like college,'' said Detroit's
Grant Hill. ``If the No. 1 team loses a game, it will be like they
slipped in the standings. You sure don't want to start out much
below .500. If you fall far off, you'll have a hard time catching
up.''
</P>
<P>
   And forget about asterisks and all that when it comes to this
year's champion. Even though Jordan and the Bulls are history and
the season has been chopped almost in half, life in the NBA goes
on. ``I think 50 is the fewest number to make it credible,'' said
the Rockets' Charles Barkley. ``I think this is probably going to
be the most exciting year in basketball. There's not a dominant,
dominant team, but I think there's about 10 teams that are very
good. I think this is going to be the most exciting year.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk about changes _ for once, people around the league are
agreeing with Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to put on a good show from the start, I think,''
said Lakers coach Del Harris. ``Why? Because each game's going to
be very important in a compacted season.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything is new this year, including most of the rosters.
Indeed, the hardest part may be simply figuring out who's playing
where.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen is in Houston, Latrell Sprewell is in New York, Antonio
McDyess is in Denver, Tom Gugliotta in Phoenix and John Starks in
Golden State. Coaches weren't exempt from the wanderlust, either.
Jackson hasn't resurfaced anywhere; George Karl, a fixture in
Seattle, hit the road for Milwaukee; while Paul Westphal slides
into the Sonics' hot seat. And Tim Floyd gets the thankless job of
trying to rebuild the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   All the movement has made most fans forget the lockout and start
talking basketball again. The NBA has stoked the fires by making
the schedule almost exclusively in-conference, making sure
rivalries were emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   Anything to win back the fans, many of whom were turned off by
the almost-seven-month lockout. And the league doesn't have Jordan
around to pack the arenas anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see why people would be excited about it, but I wish he
was still playing,'' said Knicks' coach Jeff Van Gundy of Jordan,
trying his best to sound convincing. ``He was everything that was
right about the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously great for the fans, but also for the other
players because he's such a benchmark as far as work, dedication
and commitment to winning, and I wonder where that's going to come
from now.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it will come from the rookies.
</P>
<P>
   While this year's haul isn't exactly being hyped as one for the
ages, it does include some intriguing prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Olowokandi, the No. 1 pick by the Clippers, went over to
play in Italy, but couldn't leave fast enough when he found out how
bad things are overseas. Wait until he sees what life is like as a
Clipper. The guy many view as the best rookie in the bunch lasted
all the way until the 10th pick, where Boston nabbed Paul Pierce
out of Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   It should be the veteran teams that are rewarded this year.
Utah, which features veterans like Karl Malone, John Stockton and
Jeff Hornacek, is looked upon by many as the favorite in the West,
especially after sweeping the Lakers in last year's Western
Conference finals to advance to the NBA Finals for the second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things that went wrong. That's why we got
swept,'' said the Lakers' Kobe Bryant, who recently signed a
six-year, $70 million contract extension. ``Obviously, Utah's the
team to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana leads the pack in the Eastern Conference, especially
with Chicago going the way of the Florida Marlins. The Bulls? After
winning six championships this decade, they could very easily wind
up being the worst team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is going to feel sorry for the Bulls,'' Detroit coach
Alvin Gentry said. ``And Tim Floyd is a great friend of mine. What
happened in Chicago is no different than what happened here in the
years after 1989 and 1990. The only difference is that, for them,
it happened in two days. Here, it happened over a matter of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, change is a constant in professional sports. It's just all
happening at once this season in the NBA.

TRAVEL AGENCIES PASS A `MILLENNIUM BUG' TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travel agents sighed with relief Thursday as their
computerized-reservation systems passed a key test of processing
reservations for travel in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The country's biggest travel booking systems are programmed to
issue tickets up to 331 days in advance _ meaning that Thursday was
the first time most air travelers could buy tickets to fly on Jan.
1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was fraught with anxiety that the software-coding
problem known as the Y2K bug might crash some systems. Like
companies in other industries, ticket-bookers such as Sabre Group,
Worldspan LP or Galileo International Inc. have far to go before
they can assure all of their computerized networks will operate
smoothly 11 months from now.
</P>
<P>
   The ticketing networks were programmed to use just the last two
digits of each year to keep track of the date. Such programs might
be confused by the `00' of next year, leading to worries the
booking systems might malfunction or shut down as early as Thursday
when asked to issue tickets in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That could have been hugely expensive. American travelers bought
roughly 182 million air tickets last year, according to Airlines
Reporting Corp. of Arlington, Va. The systems also handle
reservations for cruise lines, hotels and car-rental companies.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at major reservation systems said they processed
tens of thousands of orders without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at it as milestone, and it went very well,''
said Jennifer Hudson, spokeswoman for Dallas-based Sabre Group.
Most of the system is owned by the parent of American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest order, Hudson said, came from a travel agent in
London seeking a return flight for a businessman planning to return
from Los Angeles to Heathrow Airport in London. It was issued as
normal. ``We've tested and re-tested for this date for months
now...but you never really know what's going to happen,'' Hudson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales figures weren't available for Thursday, she said,
but were expected to approximate last year's. On Feb. 4, 1998, the
Sabre system booked about 10,000 reservations for travel on Jan. 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relieved,'' said Ronnie Hauptman, spokeswoman for
Galileo International Inc. in Rosemont, Ill. The company plans to
spend $25 million fixing its system in a project that won't be
complete until June. But Thursday came as a key test of its
mainframe computers, she said, and it passed without incident.
</P>
<P>
   That reassured travel agents, many of whom have already accepted
deposits from consumers signing up for cruises or ski vacations
over next New Year's weekend. ``It could have been a nightmare if
people weren't able to get flights,'' said James Ashurst, a
spokesman for the American Soceity of Travel Agents in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At Beacon Hill Travel in Boston president Dana Vannasse said he
was heartened the terminals he leases from Sabre worked as
designed. No customers made reservations to fly out Thursday, he
said, but eight clients had already booked trips with Jan. 1 return
dates.
</P>
<P>
   He obtained tickets for them without difficulty. ``Another lady
wants to come back the third and we can't do that for her yet. But
I'm not worried anymore,'' Vannasse said.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
SCOTTIE Pippen did not just recently become a celebrity. Meals have
been interrupted for years. Crowds have gathered. Traffic has
stopped so drivers could leap out to tell him, ``You're Scottie
Pippen!'' as if he would be as shocked by that revelation as they
are.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, he laughs. A van full of teen-agers stopped the other day
so the passengers could run at his car for a closer look. A woman
picked him out of a crowd to hand only him a religious pamphlet
with the reminder, ``He is the most important thing.'' Pippen
smiled and said, ``I guess she thinks He's only important to me.''
</P>
<P>
   People are always waving and smiling. He is treated not so much
as the Rockets' savior but as a child adopted to a loving family,
as appreciated as a rock star taking a stage. And Pippen shakes his
head and marvels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' he said, as if that, despite all he has received
and earned over the years, was all he wanted. ``I've been welcomed
here very warmly. People in the organization have treated me very
warmly, and that's more than I can say about the years that I spent
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels much better here. I'm not saying that I'm the man
here or that I get treated better here, but it's that people are
willing to bend over backward to make sure I'm comfortable and that
this environment is going to be here for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   This is, he always knew, how it should have been. Six
championships would have seemingly made him bulletproof in Chicago,
a ``made man.'' They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't treated as the Sundance Kid to Michael Jordan's Butch
Cassidy. He was Salieri to Mozart, McMahon to Carson.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen knew better. Basketball knew better. But somehow, the
city that should have known best of all, even the suits who ran the
Bulls, missed the point or were too caught up in worshipping Jordan
to appreciate his partner.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan tried to share at least part of that spotlight, and the
gesture helped. Pippen was always appreciated by teammates who
could relate better to him than to Jordan while still marveling at
Pippen's other-worldly talents. Fans did scream his name before he
came to Houston. They roared each spring in Grant Park when he was
introduced, and Pippen could not begrudge them if they reserved
their greatest admiration for His Airness.
</P>
<P>
   But when they honk horns or scream his name now, Pippen feels
appreciated in a way he couldn't before. Suddenly, there is enough
love to go around. Fans can celebrate him without fear they are
slighting someone else.
</P>
<P>
   And freed from the comparison he couldn't win, and an
organization that stubbornly refused to embrace him, Pippen has
instantly considered himself home in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been here only two weeks, and he's spoken more to the
organization than he had in Chicago in 11 years,'' said Pippen's
wife, Larsa. ``It means a lot. He would play hard no matter what.
They won championships even though he wasn't happy. But it's easier
to go to work when you're happy playing for a team. You want the
team to win. You want to win for the team, to give that back. He's
got great teammates. He's happy to be with Hakeem (Olajuwon) and
Charles (Barkley).
</P>
<P>
   ``The organization is giving him the attention he needs. The
feeling is awesome. People appreciate him. He's finally happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Happiness, however, does not mean a free ride. Pippen was not
seeking an escape from pressure or expectations. He couldn't have
made his point if his challenge had been placed within easy reach.
</P>
<P>
   From the day his trade to the Rockets finally received league
approval, Pippen was charged with bringing a championship _
multiple championships _ back to Houston. He won six with the
Bulls, two with the Dream Team in the Olympics. And when the Bulls
didn't win titles, the Rockets did.
</P>
<P>
   His addition, melded with the improved health of Olajuwon and
Barkley and promising signs from other newcomers, makes the Rockets
clear contenders again. But in a Western Conference crowded with
worthy championship aspirants, they are far from a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   If Pippen was driven to prove he could win without Jordan, he
gave himself a chance but with an unforgiving grading scale. And if
some have considered his legacy tarnished by the Bulls' failure to
win a championship during Jordan's basketball sabbatical, they will
likely be no more understanding now.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that, and not disinterested in shaping his legacy,
Pippen believes another title could be within reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not being predicted to get out of the West, but I still
see teams realizing that we're a very talented team,'' he said.
``This is a team that right now, once the Chicago Bulls stepped
down, this is the next team with the most experience of being able
to go to the NBA Finals (and win). We have experience on this team,
and we think we have the personnel that can get us there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go in with a positive attitude. You have to think that
realistically this is a team that will be in the Finals. That's
just how I feel. When I came here, and even before I came here, I
felt like this team had an opportunity to be in the Finals. I think
that with myself added to their roster, it just makes them a little
bit better of a contender.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets expect their newest star to touch everything they
do. The offense will still most often orbit the inside strengths of
Olajuwon and Barkley. But Pippen will work as a point forward,
initiating the work of the Rockets' players in the post while
setting up their collection of shooters outside. And while
directing much of an offense he has never run before, he will have
to provide his usual scoring, rebounding and defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, there's nothing he can't do on a basketball court,''
coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. ``He's going to help us offensively by
being a player that can shoot outside, take it inside, slash to the
basket, help on the offensive boards. His ball-handling takes
pressure off of our guards. It also gives us a lot more options on
offense. He's a great passer, a good open-court player.
</P>
<P>
   ``On defense, he's one of the most talented players. You can
match him up with almost anybody. I've seen him on point guards.
I've seen him on big people. In the Finals, they put him on the
center. There's nothing the guy can't do on the basketball court.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pippen's ability to affect his teammates' play, to make them
better, might be the most difficult and crucial of his charges.
</P>
<P>
   The fit seems to be there. He will be surrounded by shooters who
can take advantage of opportunities he creates. But finding his
niche between the half-court prowess of Olajuwon and Barkley and
the Rockets' desire to have Pippen make them run, all while
operating a system very different from Chicago's triangle, will
make for a subtle balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything is difficult,'' Pippen said. ``It's
just a matter of me learning it. It's going to take some time for
me to be able to carry it over into a game situation. But that's
what practice is about, to try and drill you enough so when you're
in a game situation, you can do things quite naturally and pretty
much be able to read situations out on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be playing that position. That was one of those things I
wanted to know about before I came into this situation, because
that's the position I've been very comfortable playing _
controlling the offense and controlling the tempo of the game. I
feel very comfortable on the floor, so I didn't want to lose that
aspect of my game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's going to happen, it's going happen naturally,'' Pippen
said. ``It's nothing where I have to go out and try to take over or
do anything. I realize that this is a team that is already
established with some great players. There's no reason for me to
come out and try to disrupt the chemistry they've worked so hard
for.''
</P>
<P>
   In the full season he spent without Jordan, Pippen was a
first-team All-NBA selection and the Most Valuable Player of the
All-Star Game. He averaged 22 points and 8.7 rebounds, the best
numbers of his career. Yet many still label him for the last 1.8
seconds of a playoff game against the Knicks when he sat out,
objecting to the decision to run a play for Toni Kukoc instead of
him.
</P>
<P>
   The shot was good, but the irony of the backlash was that if he
had run the play without protest and Kukoc had missed, Pippen would
have been labeled as unable to deliver the last-second heroics that
came to define Jordan. It didn't help either that the Bulls
painfully lost the series when Pippen was called for a phantom foul
on a missed 3-pointer by New York's Hubert Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The play robbed Pippen of the chance to win a championship
without Jordan. He has that opportunity now. And he understands he
could be defined by what happens in Houston, despite everything
that happened in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great to win another title and without Mike,''
Pippen said. ``He never won without me. A lot has to happen. But I
have a great situation. I don't anticipate him coming back (to
catch up). He's got quite a few MVP trophies, so I don't know if
I'd have anything over him. But it would be nice to have one more
championship ring than he does.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other things Pippen says he would like to accomplish.
He would like be to All-NBA again. And he considers his first MVP
and his first Defensive Player of the Year award worthwhile goals
within reach.
</P>
<P>
   But if there was one drawback to all the Bulls' success during
Pippen's tenure with them, it was that he averaged 92 games per
season, excluding the Olympics and exhibition games. He has had
major surgery three times, including before and after last season.
</P>
<P>
   But with his back repaired by offseason surgery and a grueling
rehabilitation and conditioning routine, Pippen, 33, believes he is
as strong and able as ever. And he feels rejuvenated by his new
address and the appreciation and approval with which he has been
showered in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen had long been among the most relatively underpaid players
in the NBA at $2.7 million per year and did not attempt to hide his
displeasure with that status. But it might have been more palatable
had Bulls management shown greater appreciation for his
contributions. He was all but traded to the Suns and Celtics before
recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Rockets owner Leslie Alexander, on the other hand, has called
Pippen ``a sweet guy.'' And Pippen says he spent more time with
Alexander in a two-day period _ tinkering with the five-year, $67.2
million contract he would get in the sign-and-trade deal _ than he
had with Bulls president Jerry Reinsdorf over 11 years in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has definitely been a lot of weight lifted off me by
getting out of that situation and getting a long-term contract,''
Pippen said. ``I felt that I was fairly underpaid for what I was
doing out on the court for that team _ winning and all the things
that came along with that. It wasn't a great situation to be in.
This is a different situation for me, and I want to be able to give
this organization what they're giving to me. They've invested a lot
in me trying to bring a championship to this franchise, and I want
to be able to return that favor. That's how the business should be
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even away from the game, going to restaurants or riding down
the street, people are glad to have me here in their city. The
organization and my teammates have made it a very easy transition
for me. I couldn't imagine it being any easier.''
</P>
<P>
   It is what he wanted all those years, a honeymoon he expects to
last. In fact, after a few weeks of house hunting, the Pippens
decided to start from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to build our own home,'' Larsa said. ``We love
this place.''

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
Shaquille O'Neal is ready.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And he's not afraid to let everyone know about it, either.
</P>
<P>
   In the parlance of the NBA, he's been running smack, angrily
sounding off on a variety of subjects in the preseason. Indeed,
O'Neal has been more like Smaquille O'Neal lately, using perceived
slights to pump himself up for this compressed, 50-game schedule.
The Lakers, he says, are the team to beat in the Western
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Rockets, whom the Lakers face in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Not the old and decrepit Utah Jazz, as he has read in some
publications.
</P>
<P>
   And certainly not the San Antonio Spurs, as he has read in
others.
</P>
<P>
   That one apparently was the most galling of all.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs? A team the Lakers swept last season? A team O'Neal
sees as being so soft that they practically have a chewy nougat
center? And O'Neal fully intends on chewing up any center the Spurs
plan on throwing his way, be it David Robinson or Tim Duncan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to show them who the best big men in the West really
are,'' O'Neal said. ``I'm going to kill them again. I've got to let
them know once again. I don't like David Robinson anyway. Tim
Duncan, you're too light for me down there. I'm tired of it. Now
I'm getting upset. I'm starting to get like Mike Tyson. I'm coming
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand what they're looking at. You know,
they're a pretty dominant big-man tandem, but ain't none of them
can do nothing with me. And I said it. You can tell them I said it.
If they don't like it, they can see me on the court or off the
court. They can't do nothing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Expect a Spurs-theme rap song soon.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not only the Spurs who are the target of O'Neal's ire.
Why discriminate? O'Neal said he will make the Timberwolves pay for
their refusal to gift-wrap Tom Gugliotta and ship him to LA. O'Neal
had signed off on a deal that would have sent Elden Campbell and
Eddie Jones to Minnesota for Gugliotta, but the Timberwolves
refused to pull the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Now they, too, will pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to make some moves, but I guess other teams really
don't want to help us,'' O'Neal said. ``So from now on I'll hold a
personal vendetta against Minnesota. They're added to the list.''
</P>
<P>
   It's getting to be a long list.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Harper, who signed a one-year contract with the Lakers
this season, understands O'Neal's anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the article) should be insulting to him,'' Harper said.
``He'll use it to his advantage. He wants respect. The only way to
get respect is to beat Utah and advance past the conference final.
Shaq wants a ring. I want a ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Robinson wants a ring, too. (Karl) Malone and (John)
Stockton want a ring. I know what those teams are doing. They're
preparing for war. We're going to go as far as he takes us.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that ride will be fueled by hot air, which is not only
emanating from O'Neal. Other members of the organization are
starting to get caught up in the hype, targeting this team or that
as future victims of the Lakers' glitzkrieg.
</P>
<P>
   And rest assured that Houston is not being slighted, either.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockets have gotten plenty of run since Scottie Pippen
hopped on for the ride. But even Lakers general manager Jerry West,
normally the mild-mannered sort, is starting to pick up on Shaq's
vibe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can compete against Houston,'' West said. ``No matter who
they have, we can compete against Houston. To get a player like
Scottie Pippen obviously is tremendous for them, but we have a team
that's younger. I think from one to 12, we'll be more talented than
them. But to say we have three players that measure up to the
magnitude of their press clippings, no.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we have one player on our team that's absolutely
unstoppable. And I don't think they have anyone who can stop him at
this point in time without a lot of help.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you listening, Hakeem Olajuwon?
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a method to O'Neal's madness.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, perhaps sniffing a real title shot since Michael Jordan
decided to retire, could simply be trying to get the Lakers rallied
in a classic us-against-them mindset. It has to be better than the
us-against-us mentality that could be the Lakers' biggest enemy
this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers could very well be on the verge of greatness, or they
could implode at any time after an offseason of rumored trades.
Campbell and Jones can't be happy after the grapevine had them off
to Minnesota or Chicago. And those rumors still have them on the
move, perhaps going to Toronto. Or Orlando. Or Miami. Or Charlotte.
Or well, you get the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Del Harris thinks (hopes?) Campbell, a classic
underachiever, will understand what happened, that he was in demand
because of his talent, and will soldier along with the rest of the
Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But there could be plenty of animosity to go around, since
that's not the only problem the Lakers are facing.
</P>
<P>
   Who's going to step up to replace Nick Van Exel, who should have
been called ``Nick of Time'' because of his propensity for
last-second heroics? Van Exel, who was traded to Denver before the
lockout, was one of the rare ones _ a player willing to put himself
on the line to make the big play _ and the Lakers don't really have
those in abundance.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the fact that Jones has to deal with the fat
contract extension _ six years, $70 million _ Kobe Bryant received
last week. And then there's Rick Fox, who took a lot less money
last year to come to the Lakers, only to be rebuffed in his
attempts to cash in this year. The Lakers wound up giving him the
middle-class exception ($1.75 million), which means that he, too,
will have a frown that needs turning upside-down.
</P>
<P>
   This is a battle that could be fought on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   West, however, is already involved in damage control.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a danger in messing around with a team that
won 61 games with a lot of injuries last year and hasn't been
together very long,'' he said. ``We would have to think that this
would be looked upon as a powerful team (even) if we didn't do
anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   Nope, they're saving that for the rest of the league.

CITY CENTER TRYING TO CATCH UP WITH NEW YORK'S TOP CULTURAL
INSTITUTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite its landmark building, affordable tickets,
all-star roster and a musical-theater series that has been a
launching pad for Broadway, City Center has never quite radiated
the luster of Lincoln Center or Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Now, says Raymond A. Lamontagne, its new chairman, the 55th
Street institution is gearing up to change its reputation as the
poor relative of its uptown neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   One month into his appointment, after succeeding Howard M.
Squadron, Lamontagne has already proposed a series of initiatives
to move City Center into the top tier of the city's cultural
institutions. Most important, he said in an interview, is a capital
campaign to build an endowment and the development of a board with
greater financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``City Center has zero endowment,'' Lamontagne said. ``It has
always been known as the `people's theater' and has never had the
same sort of financial backing as Lincoln Center or Carnegie Hall.
I want to put together a case statement for raising money so we can
do more self-presenting, fix the building and bring in more
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   After five years as a board member, Lamontagne, the president of
Seavest Inc., a family investment office, and the Encore Co., a
private investment concern, replaced Squadron, who stepped down on
Jan. 1 after being chairman for 23 years. At the same time, Elaine
Malsin, a former president of the Paul Taylor Dance Company and a
board member, was promoted to co-chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Squadron led the drive to save the City Center building from
demolition and oversaw the center's incorporation in the 1970s as a
self-sustaining entity separate from City Center Music and Drama
Inc., the parent company of City Center 55th Street, the New York
City Ballet and the New York City Opera. He was instrumental in
expanding the center's dance-based programming to include music and
theater over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howard is really the father of City Center,'' said Judith E.
Daykin, the president and executive director. ``He took us through
the incorporation to become a driving force in the arts, and we
will miss his generosity and dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamontagne says he is eager to build on Squadron's legacy, and
building a more powerful board is a high priority. Even with the
actors Joanne Woodward and Alec Baldwin among its ranks, ``there
aren't a lot of fancy big names, but the people we have are working
hard,'' he said. ``I'll be working to add greater financial clout
to the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Money will also be earmarked for a program to attract less
affluent audiences and for score restoration, which lies at the
heart of the center's highly successful series ``City Center
Encores! Great American Musicals in Concert.'' The series, now in
its sixth season, started off by presenting rarely heard, early
Broadway musicals in concert productions. The center took a leap in
1996, however, when it mounted a concert staging of the 1975
musical ``Chicago,'' starring Ann Reinking and Bebe Neuwirth. It
was so successful that it moved to Broadway, where it remains, and
won six Tony Awards. The ``Encores'' series, which has a 96 percent
renewal rate among subscribers, has received awards from Jujamcyn
Theaters, the New York Drama Critics Circle, Lucille Lortel and the
Outer Critics Circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can not only save great American treasures but also have a
pipeline of things `Encores' can do for the next few years,''
Lamontagne said. ``We need to take advantage of the fact that there
are still people who remember history. They won't be around
forever.'' ``It's time to make a huge leap forward,'' Lamontagne
said. ``We're in a terrific position right now. We've balanced our
budget, paid our debts. It's just a very strong team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``City Center is a great turnaround story,'' he added. ``From a
place that was ignored a few years ago, we have come back and made
a substantial contribution to the cultural life of New York.''

`MAKING TRACKS': IMMIGRANTS TRAVERSE MILES AND GENERATIONS IN SONG

   NEW YORK _ Miyuki is one of the lucky ones. When she and the
other Japanese ``picture brides'' arrive in Seattle in 1918,
clutching photographs of their future husbands, whom they have
never met, her bridegroom, Tokashi, actually looks like his
picture. (Some of the other brides find that the photos were taken
20 years before.) Marriage isn't always easy for them.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when Tokashi (Thomas Kouo) makes a supportive
remark, Miyuki (Aiko Nakasone) blurts out, ``That's the most
romantic thing you've said to me in years.'' He quickly clarifies
things: ``I did not mean it that way.'' But they finally sing a
duet, ``So Now I See You,'' before he dies after 50 years of
marriage. It's all very Andrew Lloyd Webberish.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes are from ``Making Tracks,'' a promising if wobbly new
rock musical that celebrates the Asian-American immigrant
experience. Welly Yang (book and concept), Brian Yorkey and C.
Matthew Eddy (book and lyrics) and Woody Pak (composer) have done
an admirable job and filled a real need for a theatrical treatment
of this subject.
</P>
<P>
   The show may not be quite ready for off-Broadway yet, but the
structure is there; the humor works, and the staging is heading in
the right direction. The show comes to life in the group musical
numbers, and there is, on occasion, a hint of the energy and
hopefulness of ``Rent.'' A hint.
</P>
<P>
   Miyuki, in her orange kimono, stands on the same nearly bare
stage as the Granddaughter (Kiki Moritsugu), a young woman of the
1990s who wears a red suit with an Ally McBeal-short skirt and
seems permanently attached to her notebook computer. Ms.
Moritsugu's character is at a hospital visiting her grandmother
(Virginia Wing), who tells Miyuki's tale and those of other
Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The first characters build the transcontinental railroad in 1865
(the title's literal meaning is the laying down of railroad
tracks), working 13-hour days and 6-day weeks. Others face the
horrors of Angel Island in San Francisco Bay in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Yang is particularly good, both funny and touching, as a young
Chinese man who finds his name misunderstood by immigration
officials, so that for the rest of his life he is known as Lucky
Chuck. Chuck cannot get past the officials because he can't
remember how many pigs were on his father's farm.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Japanese-Americans like the San Francisco
nightclub singer known as ``the Chinese Frank Sinatra'' (Timothy
Huang), even though he is not Chinese, are ripped away from their
normal lives and thrown into detention camps. One soldier who
fought for the United States and lost a leg returns home to America
only to encounter a barber who won't cut his hair because he looks
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making Tracks,'' ably directed by Lenny Leibowitz, continues
at the Taipei Theater through Feb. 14. The show needs to overcome
its frequent literalness, tone down the cheerleading and choose a
finale (it seems to have three or four); it already has nascent
style and a message well worth conveying.

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Suffice it to say that the gauntlet has been
thrown at the feet of David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Gauntlet? Heck, Shaquille O'Neal dumped Robinson's entire
wardrobe out on the street and dared the Admiral _ or Tim Duncan,
for that matter _ to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   After reading an article that had the Spurs, a team the Lakers
swept last season, listed as the preseason favorites in the West,
O'Neal went ballistic, basically saying he could have his way with
either San Antonio center and that if they didn't like it, ``they
can see me on the court or off the court. They can't do nothing
with me.''
</P>
<P>
   So that's how it's going to be this season.
</P>
<P>
   As if things weren't intense enough with the NBA going to a
50-game post-lockout schedule, along comes O'Neal to start turning
up the heat on the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, however, has refused to bite. So far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' Robinson said when asked if he had any response to
O'Neal's tough talk. ``That would be foolish, just getting involved
in that. I don't have anything to say about that. It's all going to
be decided on the basketball court. You have to go out and you have
to win games. That's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's what the Spurs are supposed to be all about this
year. But first, some say, they have to change their mindset.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have long been accused of being the NBA's equivalent
to a Furbie _ soft and fuzzy, but outrageously marketable. They
were the NBA's good guys, and bad apples like Dennis Rodman and
Vernon Maxwell weren't tolerated for long. The Spurs were built
around Robinson, whose spit-and-shine image is that of the
All-American good guy. The Naval Academy instead of the streets.
Standing at attention during the national anthem rather than
popping gum and looking for babes in the stands. Smiling and
fan-friendly rather than aloof or trash-talking. Classical music
vs. rap.
</P>
<P>
   All the things that are pretty much uncool in the NBA these
days.
</P>
<P>
   Guys like Duncan and Avery Johnson fall right in line. Not that
they're not intense competitors, because they are. But they're not
really intimidators, and the Spurs haven't had one of those since
Antoine Carr, who signed with the Rockets this season, skipped town
four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the Baseline Bums when you need them?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the Spurs went out looking for tough guys, players who
have been tested in big games where championships have been on the
line.
</P>
<P>
   And they found them in Mario Elie and Jerome Kersey.
</P>
<P>
   While Robinson is known as The Admiral, Elie, the former Rocket,
and Kersey, who spent last season with the Sonics, are more like
drill sergeants. Elie, from American International University, and
Kersey, who went to college at Longwood (Va.), are guys who had to
be hard as nails just to make it into the NBA, so they won't be
very tolerant to any perceived softness.
</P>
<P>
   Elie immediately took up the cause, making sure he had the
Admiral's back when O'Neal started rapping the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shaq, I don't know what he's thinking,'' said Elie, who played
on the Rockets team that swept O'Neal's Orlando Magic in the 1995
NBA Finals. ``The guy is a great player, but all you have to do is
foul him down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he had made some free throws and taken his team to the next
level, then he can talk. We know he's a great player, so you don't
have to tell anybody. David (Robinson) is a great player. Tim
(Duncan) is a great player. They just go out and do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Kerr will be expected to do the same. Indeed, the
Spurs shored up their outside shooting by getting Kerr, another
big-game veteran, from the Chicago Bulls' fire sale. Those three
are expected to make huge contributions for the Spurs. The Spurs
also welcome back Sean Elliott at the three spot _ that's small
forward, for you non-scouting types _ after he played just 36 games
last year because of knee problems.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott has looked sensational so far, but the rest of the cast
is pretty much the same. Johnson is back at the point, but the
Spurs, who only seem to have been looking for a shooting guard
since George Gervin retired, are going with erratic Jaren Jackson
at that position after Vinny Del Negro decided to play in Europe
during the lockout, then signed on in Milwaukee afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Elie, Kerr and Kersey have an air about them that demands
respect. And Elie and Kerr have something else, too _ rings. And
they know how to get them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys walk into the locker room and it's instant
credibility,'' said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. ``The seriousness
of the group and the confidence of the group automatically rises
without the guy even saying a word. That's the way it is with
Mario.''
</P>
<P>
   Avery Johnson has been just as impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys,'' he said, ``even talk like champions.''

COUNTRY CAN `WALK AWAY FROM' TROUBLES, CLINTON TELLS AUDIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Just hours before the Senate resumed his
impeachment trial, President Clinton told an elite gathering at a
prayer breakfast that if South African President Nelson Mandela
could ``walk away from 28 years of oppression in a little prison
cell, we can walk away from whatever is bothering us.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked his audience of diplomats and members of Congress,
prime ministers and Cabinet officials to ``pray that we can all be
purged of the temptation to pretend that our willfulness is
somewhat equal to God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   Without directly mentioning the sex scandal that led to his
becoming the second president to be impeached in more than 131
years, Clinton said, ``All the great peacemakers in the world in
the end have to let go and walk away, like Christ, not from
apparent but from genuine grievances.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks came at the annual National Prayer Breakfast,
a tradition in Washington since 1952, when the House and Senate
came together to pray for newly elected President Dwight Eisenhower
and his government.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, an overflowing crowed of some 2,600 people, including
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat whose attendance caused a few
members of Congress to stay away in protest, jammed into a hotel
ballroom for spiritual nourishment and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   Politics was to be checked at the door, a point underscored by
the harmless banter between Clinton and Representative Steve
Largent, an Oklahoma Republican who hosted this year's event and
also voted to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a terrific relationship with Steve Largent, and he
has yet to vote with me,'' Clinton joked, reaching over to pat the
congressman's back. ``I know there is no politics in this prayer
breakfast.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent responded: ``Mr. President, as you said I may not have
voted with you in the four years I've been in Congress, but I want
you to know that I care for you and love you, and that's part of
the mystery of Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   Largent also threw a friendly jab at Vice President Al Gore. ``I
was joking with the vice president earlier about how the prayer
breakfast was Thursday, but his prayers were answered earlier in
the week when (House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt) pulled
out of the presidential race.''
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts at civility and reconcilation extended only so
far.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Bob Barr, a Georgia Republican who has long
called for Clinton's removal from office and is one of the House
prosecutors in the impeachment trial, rose from his seat and exited
the room right before the president went to the lectern to speak.
</P>
<P>
   If impeachment was on anyone's mind, it was left to Senator
Joseph Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, to make the only
direct reference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord, may I say a special prayer at this time of difficulty
for our president,'' he said. ``That you would hear his prayers.
That you help him with the work he's doing with his family and his
clergy. That you accept his atonement.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton devoted most of his remarks _ which he said he had
stayed up late the night before discussing with his wife _ to a
prayer for world peace from Ireland to the Middle East, Bosnia to
Kosovo, Ethiopia to Eritrea, India to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you to pray for peace, for the peacemakers, and for
peace within each of our hearts _ in silence,'' he said, bowing his
head to lead the audience in a moment of silent prayer.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's comment that Nazi German dictator Adolf
Hitler preached a ``perverted form of Christianity,'' angered a
Catholic group.
</P>
<P>
   William Donohue, president of the Catholic League, asked Clinton
to apologize for what he described as ``a remarkably ignorant
comment about Hitler and Christianity.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued from his New York office, Donohue said,
``Anyone who has studied Hitler knows that this is pure nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   After the breakfast, Clinton met with Arafat for about 20
minutes, and reiterated the US position that unilateral steps, such
as a Palestinian declaration of statehood in May, would be
unhelpful, according to White House spokesman Barry Toiv.
</P>
<P>
   Later, meeting with a group of business leaders, Clinton for the
first time said the United States was ``seriously considering the
possibility'' of deploying American troops as part of an
international peace force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He said no final decision had yet been made, but he outlined
four conditions that must be met, including a commitment by both
parties to end the violence and a well-defined NATO mission with a
clear exit strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that happens we are seriously considering the possibility
of our participation in such a force,'' Clinton said. ``We are
discussing it now with Congress and our allies, but no decision has
been reached.''

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Routine drug-resistance tests suggested for some
with HIV
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Drug-resistant forms of the AIDS virus are showing up
more and more often, worrying doctors and patients who fear they'll
run out of treatment options before new drugs become available.
</P>
<P>
   Testing viral strains for resistance to HIV drugs still is an
imprecise science, but AIDS researchers appear to be leaning in
favor of it to plan patients' drug therapy, especially for pregnant
women and their infants, some newly infected people and health care
workers exposed to HIV-infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is clear that resistance tests will be widely
available over this year, and I would clearly approve of them,''
said Dr. Brian Gazzard of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in
London. Gazzard spoke Thursday about resistance testing at the
Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Chicago,
a scientific meeting on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot study of 153 patients completed in December showed
roughly three in four people with HIV whose drug therapy had
stopped working were infected with resistant viral strains. Another
study among HIV-positive, active-duty U.S. military concluded that
about one in five recently infected people had resistant virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the biggest problems we have,'' said Dr. Melanie
Thompson, lead researcher at the AIDS Research Consortium of
Atlanta. She also treats people with HIV at her private practice in
Atlanta. ``So many patients are losing so many options.''
</P>
<P>
   Several studies presented at the Chicago conference concluded
that resistance testing might be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of resistance tests, neither of which has
federal approval. Phenotypic tests measure the performance of HIV
drugs _ of which 14 are approved _ against an HIV strain. Genotypic
tests genetically map part of the virus, then search for key
mutations associated with resistance to certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But interpreting tests results isn't as simple as looking at the
gene map and checking off drugs. Some HIV drugs are more
susceptible to resistance than others; for instance, the widely
used drug 3TC is rendered useless by a single, common mutation.
Some mutations cause cross-resistance among drugs, eliminating
several options at once.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson plans to test for resistance only when she thinks it
useful, such as for newly infected people who are acutely ill.
</P>
<P>
   The tests also are well-suited for pregnant women and newborns,
Thompson said, since cases have been recorded of mothers passing
resistant virus to babies. Also, health care workers exposed to
infected blood through needle sticks or other accidents should be
tested, said Robert Lloyd of Applied Sciences, a resistance testing
lab in Norcross owned by Visible Genetics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many AIDS specialists _ including Gazzard _ still aren't
willing to fully rely on the tests. ``Using resistance testing
intelligently is going to be a major and taxing undertaking,'' he
said.

 &HT;    NBC reduces ` '60s'to a string of cliches
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You better inhale if you want to get through these '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly an interesting decade, it's now a laughable miniseries.
NBC's ``The '60s,'' airing at 9 p.m. Sunday and Monday, makes the
four hours it takes to cover those 10 years feel like a millennium.
Man. It leaves no stock character unturned, no song from the era
unsung, no ``bummer, man'' unspoken. It's the kind of '60s
nostalgia that makes you nostalgic for the '90s. It's the '60s as
K-Tel might package it and offer for $8.99 on late-night TV.
</P>
<P>
   It's actually a little bit irresistible like that _ a one-shot,
cut-rate guilty pleasure. Guided by executive producer Lynda Obst
(``Contact,'' ``Sleepless in Seattle''), it runs with Gumplike
speed through the decade's icons and signposts, as if they were
stacked on shelves in a Sam's Warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Actual news footage is spliced throughout the drama _ King's
March on Washington, Wallace's ``segregation forever'' speech, the
1968 Chicago riots _ while the drama often turns black-and-white to
make it appear more urgent. The soundtrack moves from the Chiffons
to the Doors to the Band, though you get the feeling somebody has
his hand on a button just dying every few frames to play Dylan's
``The Times They Are a Changin'.''
</P>
<P>
   These '60s are witnessed and experienced largely through the
eyes of a Catholic family in Chicago. They're all anybody needs:
Marine veteran Dad (Bill Smitrovich), just-aiming-to-please Mom
(Anne Corley), Notre Dame-bound quarterback son Bryan (Jerry
O'Connell), straight-A son Michael (Josh Hamilton), good-time
daughter Katie (Julia Stiles).
</P>
<P>
   Everything is ranch house, prom king ``Pleasantville'' _ until
somebody puts on ``The Twist'' and Southern blacks start sitting at
lunch counters. By then, 1962, a certain nervousness is creeping
around the decade's '50s-style edges. When Kennedy is shot in 1963,
the '60s that everybody means when they say ``the '60s'' finally
show up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next few years, Bryan is fighting in Nam, Michael is
protesting the war, and Katie is pregnant and living the San
Francisco hippie life. Man. Mom's getting happy feet, too (``I
always imagined something a little more Jackie Kennedy in my
life''), though she doesn't give up on poor Dad, who's watching the
end of the world as he knows it.
</P>
<P>
   That all plays out on a predictable emotional time line: Nam vet
comes back a mess (think Tom Cruise in ``Born on the Fourth of
July''), anti-war protestor wants to make love not slogans, and
hippie chick tires of her jobless ``old man'' and returns home with
her son for three squares a day (though not before Dad apologizes
for being such a jerk). The movie's foot-through-the-TV moment
comes late Monday, when all the siblings somehow wind up together
at Woodstock.
</P>
<P>
   There's a parallel '60s experienced by a black Mississippi
family. It features Charles S. Dutton as an activist King disciple
trying to temper the hate of Leonard Roberts, his radicalized
teenage son. But in the spirit of that era, the black family is
used in this miniseries as a kind of token nod toward diversity and
often feels more insulting than inclusive.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's hard to single out anyone or anything here for insult.
Nobody looks good. They're all cliches wrapped in stereotypes,
displayed with well-worn, hackneyed banality.
</P>
<P>
   To coin a phrase. Man.

 &HT;    HEALTH/SCIENCE: Routine drug-resistance tests suggested for some
with HIV
 &HT;    By Lillian Lee Kim
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Drug-resistant forms of the AIDS virus are showing up
more and more often, worrying doctors and patients who fear they'll
run out of treatment options before new drugs become available.
</P>
<P>
   Testing viral strains for resistance to HIV drugs still is an
imprecise science, but AIDS researchers appear to be leaning in
favor of it to plan patients' drug therapy, especially for pregnant
women and their infants, some newly infected people and health care
workers exposed to HIV-infected blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is clear that resistance tests will be widely
available over this year, and I would clearly approve of them,''
said Dr. Brian Gazzard of Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in
London. Gazzard spoke Thursday about resistance testing at the
Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections in Chicago,
a scientific meeting on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot study of 153 patients completed in December showed
roughly three in four people with HIV whose drug therapy had
stopped working were infected with resistant viral strains. Another
study among HIV-positive, active-duty U.S. military concluded that
about one in five recently infected people had resistant virus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the biggest problems we have,'' said Dr. Melanie
Thompson, lead researcher at the AIDS Research Consortium of
Atlanta. She also treats people with HIV at her private practice in
Atlanta. ``So many patients are losing so many options.''
</P>
<P>
   Several studies presented at the Chicago conference concluded
that resistance testing might be helpful.
</P>
<P>
   There are two types of resistance tests, neither of which has
federal approval. Phenotypic tests measure the performance of HIV
drugs _ of which 14 are approved _ against an HIV strain. Genotypic
tests genetically map part of the virus, then search for key
mutations associated with resistance to certain drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But interpreting tests results isn't as simple as looking at the
gene map and checking off drugs. Some HIV drugs are more
susceptible to resistance than others; for instance, the widely
used drug 3TC is rendered useless by a single, common mutation.
Some mutations cause cross-resistance among drugs, eliminating
several options at once.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson plans to test for resistance only when she thinks it
useful, such as for newly infected people who are acutely ill.
</P>
<P>
   The tests also are well-suited for pregnant women and newborns,
Thompson said, since cases have been recorded of mothers passing
resistant virus to babies. Also, health care workers exposed to
infected blood through needle sticks or other accidents should be
tested, said Robert Lloyd of Applied Sciences, a resistance testing
lab in Norcross owned by Visible Genetics Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many AIDS specialists _ including Gazzard _ still aren't
willing to fully rely on the tests. ``Using resistance testing
intelligently is going to be a major and taxing undertaking,'' he
said.

HITACHI INCREASES ESTIMATE OF LOSSES, OTHER JAPANESE COMPANIES MAY
FOLLOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The stronger yen is pinching Japanese businesses and
could hamper the recovery of the nation's economy, but the
government may be reluctant to intervene again to lower the
currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi Ltd., the sprawling conglomerate that makes everything
from semiconductors and personal computers to kitchen cabinets and
rice cookers, Thursday increased its estimate of losses for the
fiscal year that ends March 31 and attributed the rise largely to
the stronger yen.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has already started revamping its operations,
said it expected to lose an additional 125 billion yen, or $1.1
billion, bringing its estimated losses to 375 billion yen, or $3.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi attributed the additional losses to the yen's rise and a
one-time charge of 185 billion yen. In November, when the company
made its original estimate, it had expected the yen to hover around
125 to the dollar, but since October the yen has averaged 117.9 to
the dollar, lowering the anticipated value of Hitachi's overseas
earnings. A strong yen is damaging because it makes Japanese
exports, a possible engine of economic recovery, much more
expensive, and therefore, less competitive abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Other major Japanese exporters, many of which expected the same
exchange rate as Hitachi , are expected to follow suit and announce
reduced earnings prospects over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Japanese government intervened to cap the yen's
rise in mid-January, it is hovering between 112 and 113 to the
dollar, and many economists believe the currency's continued
strength will further depress corporate Japan's prospects. Without
factoring in the yen's rise, many analysts have estimated that more
than 70 percent of Japanese companies will report losses this
fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for
international affairs, did not rule out further intervention when
he spoke last week at a meeting of world financial leaders in
Davos, Switzerland. But he added that the strengthening of the yen
``is not causing problems for the Japanese economy'' and that
Japanese companies were competitive at levels of 115 to 116 yen to
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   He said that exchange rates that prevailed during the onset of
Japan's financial crisis, when the yen approached 150 to the
dollar, were an aberration. ``Arguing that such rates are necessary
ingredients for the recovery implicitly assumes that Japan is still
amid a severe financial crisis,'' he said, adding that the
financial crisis ``is about to end.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were somewhat surprised by the increase in Hitachi's
estimated loss. Although rich in cash, the company's balance sheet
has weakened over the last three years to a point where its net
debt, or the liabilities that would be left on its balance sheet
after using all of its cash to pay down debt, is approaching 1
trillion yen, or $8.85 billion, said Steven Myers, senior analyst
at Jardine Fleming Securities in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Profit in the next fiscal year is in question if the yen
doesn't weaken,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi has been working to revamp its heavy electric and
consumer electronics businesses and is still working to pare costs
at its semiconductor operations, whose profitability has suffered
from a lack of investment in upgrading plants and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It is also working to trim employees through attrition and early
retirement to reduce costs. Top management has also been shuffled,
although analysts think the changes in the executive suite,
scheduled to take place this summer, will be largely cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts regard its efforts as minimal and have been
urging it to get out of unprofitable businesses. ``I hope that this
will kick management into gear to seriously reshape the group,''
Myers said. &QL;

ARTICLE ABOUT DAUGHTER DISTRESSES CLINTONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chelsea Clinton has her mother's strength and her
father's optimism. Despite feeling betrayed, angry, and humiliated
by The Scandal, the 18-year-old first daughter loves her parents
and won't wear her emotions on her sleeve. And as for the story
that Chelsea collapsed last fall after breaking up with her
boyfriend, that was ``blown way out of proportion,'' a friend told
People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The cover story, ``Grace Under Fire,'' which hits the newsstands
Friday, is no hatchet job. Still, the Clintons are having a fit
over the story, the first piece that promises ``an intimate look at
the deep bond of love that sustains the Clinton women through their
painful family ordeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong White House reaction _ including an extraordinary
appeal to the magazine from Marsha Berry, the first lady's press
secretary, to kill the story _ signaled more than a fear that
Chelsea's privacy had been violated. It suggested a worry that at
age 18, and as a player in the White House family drama, Chelsea
might become a window for other media to probe the complex and very
private relationships of the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   And some wondered whether the Clintons weren't trying to have it
both ways _ to stage-manage Chelsea's media exposure as the devoted
daughter in a happy-family portrait during a year of scandal, while
keeping the Stanford sophomore safely away from the unfiltered
glare of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't become a virgin a second time,'' said conservative
commentator Arianna Huffington, noting that when the Clintons
needed the family image in the 1992 campaign, they invited People
magazine into their home for a story and photographs. ``The reason
the Clintons are making such a public stand now is not so much
because they are mad at People magazine _ it's a glowing story _
but because they want to stop an avalanche of media coverage of
their daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chelsea has been largely, remarkably, out of the media
spotlight during her father's tenure in the White House. In 1993,
the Clintons firmly laid down the law about Chelsea's privacy after
the then 12-year-old was portrayed in an unflattering ``Saturday
Night Live'' skit. In the mainstream media, the off-limit
instructions on Chelsea by and large, have been followed.
</P>
<P>
   At least until the People profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``We deeply regret and are profoundly saddened by the decision
of People magazine to print a cover story featuring our daughter,
Chelsea,'' the president and Hillary Rodham Clinton said in an
joint statement that went out in a press alert Wednesday night.
``For over six years, the media has understood and respected the
unique situation facing Chelsea as she grows up in the spotlight
focused on her parents.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons said Chelsea should be spared scrutiny because,
other than in family situations, she ``has not taken on a public
role.'' And they pleaded with the media to ``continue its policy of
restraint with respect to our daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at People magazine said they were sensitive to the
appeal, but not persuaded to stop publication. ``Chelsea is nearly
19 years old and a poised young adult,'' said Carole Wallace,
People's managing editor. ``We feel that because she is an
eyewitness to the family drama and historical events unfolding
around her, she is a valid journalistic subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail Collins, author of ``Scorpion Tongues,'' said while the
press has been happy to leave Chelsea alone, it is getting harder
to make a rational argument that she is too young or vulnerable to
be protected by the old rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to say you can draft Chelsea and send her to war,
but you can't write about her,'' said Collins, who is an editorial
writer at the New York Times. ``How old was Monica _ 21? _ when she
had an affair with the president? Nobody is arguing that she was
too tender to be bothered with.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Chelsea has been called up by the White House in its
time of greatest peril. There was the touching picture of Chelsea
clutching her parents's hands as they left the White House in
August in the wake of the president's disclosures of an
extramarital affair. The White House made much of Chelsea's romance
last year with an all-American boy. And former Senator Dale Bumpers
of Arkansas referred to Chelsea by name during his speech before
the Senate impeachment trial last month, suggesting the family had
suffered enough in a relationship that was ``incredibly strained,
if not destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Brit Hume, the Washington managing editor for Fox TV News, said
``it's a very close call'' for the press in deciding if, as People
magazine said, Chelsea has become a ``valid journalistic subject.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfair to say you are a public figure by extension of who
you are related to,'' Hume said. ``But if Chelsea crosses the
threshold, if she is consciously putting herself out there as a
symbol of support for her father, it's hard to argue that she isn't
news.''
</P>
<P>
   Hume said many journalists operate on the ``out-there factor'' _
that is, once a story appears in a wide-circulation publication
like People, the subject becomes fair game for the rest of the
press.
</P>
<P>
   The wall protecting Chelsea started to break down in November,
when many media outlets, including The Boston Globe, reported that
Chelsea had broken up with her boyfriend and had sought treatment
at Stanford's health center for stress-related symptoms. The story
first appeared in the tabloid newspapers, the National Enquirer and
the Star, but it did not get wide attention in the mainstream press
until the New York Post reported it.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rosensteil, director for the Project for Excellence in
Journalism, a nonprofit group that monitors press performance, said
the Clintons's efforts to protect their daughter from the media
horde have been ``one of the genuinely endearing things about this
tragically messed up family.'' He accused People magazine of
exploiting Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is garbage,'' Rosensteil said. ``Chelsea's story is not
important, there is no overriding public good in reporting it. This
is exploitation to sell magazines, and journalists everywhere
should stand up and say, `Shame on you; don't you have any
decency?' ''

INDIA TO LET RUSHDIE RETURN; MUSLIMS PROTEST 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARRY BEARAK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Salman Rushdie has been granted a visa to
return to India, his native land, whose banning of his novel ``The
Satanic Verses'' began a chain of events that led to death threats
by offended Muslims and a life in hiding for a writer with a price
on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, made in the highest reaches of the Indian
government, was confirmed Thursday by a spokesman for the Ministry
of External Affairs and, when announced, prompted immediate threats
of violent demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will protest within a constitutional framework, but I warn
the government of India that a righteous follower of the Holy
Prophet may make an attempt on Rushdie's life, and each Muslim will
be proud of this person,'' said Syed Ahmad Bukhari, deputy priest
of Jama Masjid, the best-known mosque in new Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rushdie wrote a book that hurt the Muslims of the world,'' he
said. ``The painful memories are still in the minds of people. If
the government goes ahead with its plans, Muslims will not tolerate
this. I appeal to the government to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rushdie, who was born in Bombay and lives in Britain with
British citizenship, has used India as the inspiration for much of
his work, he repeatedly has been denied a visa since ``The Satanic
Verses'' was published in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long struggle,'' Rushdie said Thursday in a
telephone interview in London. ``It's a terrible thing to be unable
to go to the country of one's birth, and it's been over 10 years,
which is certainly the longest gap in my life. It feels like
another step back into the light. I've got aunts and uncles and
cousins and friends littered all over the country.''
</P>
<P>
   This ``step back into the light'' follows a major stride in
September, when Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, distanced
his government from the fatwa, or religious edict, issued by
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989. The Iranian revolutionary
leader, who has since died, charged Rushdie with blasphemy and
called for his death.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kharazi's statement, other Muslims in Iran and elsewhere
have declared that the fatwa cannot be rescinded. Hard-line groups
have added bounties on the author's head that exceed $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rushdie had good reason to celebrate a loosening of his
tethers. Late last year, the home minister in India's Hindu
nationalist government, Lal Krishna Advani, said that he was an
admirer of the writer and that ``he is welcome to come home.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the novelist's lawyer said the travel documents
were expected to be issued imminently, but then there were
unexplained delays, enough that now, with the visa in hand, Rushdie
said he had no definite schedule for his journey home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent so long not being able to go that I had put out of my
mind the possibility of going,'' he said. ``It's still sinking in.
Then I guess I'll start planning what and where.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While India had been excluding Rushdie from its shores, much of
the world had been including him in lists of eminent Indians. His
novel ``Midnight's Children'' is shaped around Indian independence
and won the Booker Prize, the prestigious British award. In 1993,
it was named the best Booker Prize winner of the previous 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of that laurel, Rushdie was at work on ``The Moor's
Last Sigh,'' a critically praised epic set in India. Copies sold
rapidly in India, but then the government banned the book after an
initial consignment of 4,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Satanic Verses'' was never published here. Because of the
complaints that it was insulting to Muslims, India banned the novel
in October 1988, and Sri Lanka and Pakistan followed suit.
Demonstrations against the book became violent.

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
IT just doesn't sound right.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Bulls have always entered the season as the favorites to win
the NBA title, haven't they?
</P>
<P>
   But no Michael and no Scottie means no chance for the Bulls. In
case you haven't heard, Michael Jordan has retired and Scottie
Pippen is a Rocket, meaning the NBA title is once again up for
grabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No team is the perfect team,'' said NBC analyst and Hall of
Famer Bill Walton. ``It's going to be a great season _ for the
first time nobody knows who is going to win the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone has an opinion, though, and in these post-lockout,
post-Jordan times, it's the Indiana Pacers who are just about
everyone's favorite to win this year's NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that _ a former American Basketball Association team
favored to win the NBA title. The Pacers were always expected to be
in the running for the ABA championship, winning three, but they've
never been considered among the top NBA contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers return everyone from the team that extended the Bulls
to seven games in last year's Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   Even Charles Barkley, one of the toughest people to impress,
seems taken with the Pacers, who spent the lockout playing together
at a local Indianapolis gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Indiana is the team to beat,'' he said. ``They have
the advantage because they practiced the whole time during the
lockout and they have everybody back. They don't have to worry
about chemistry problems. They almost beat the Bulls last year, and
I think people fail to take that into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``They took the Bulls to seven games, and you can't remember the
last time that happened.''
</P>
<P>
   But can they handle the pressure? The Bulls did, year after
year. It remains to be seen if the Pacers can do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really stretched the Bulls to the limit last year and
keeping that same team intact, I think all eyes are upon you,''
said guard Reggie Miller. ``You've got to take that with a grain of
salt. Everyone has a shot this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami, with Riley, is always in the hunt. Now that (Latrell)
Sprewell's in New York, you almost have to give them the edge. With
a healthy Patrick Ewing, and Allan Houston and Sprewell at the two
and three spots, that's very dangerous. Just because everyone on
paper is picking us, we still have a long ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another element to this season that has gone largely
unspoken. Last year, Pacers coach Larry Bird didn't know what to
expect. This year, he will demand nothing less than championship
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' said Bird of the pressure. ``When I played, we
had a lot of expectations in Boston and I like it for this team
here. We'll see what they're made of.''
</P>
<P>
   It's rubbing off. The Pacers are starting to feel like they're
the favorites, which is half the battle at this level.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have only so many years left with this group, so it does
put a lot of pressure on us this year to go further than we've
been,'' said Indiana center Rik Smits. ``A championship is our goal
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be a fight, though, with several teams looking to
jump into the void left by the dismantling of the Bulls' dynasty.

DEUTSCHE BANK RELEASES DOCUMENTS SHOWING FINANCING FOR AUSCHWITZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AUSTRIA-HOLOCAUST) 
(DW) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Deutsche Bank AG, which is negotiating to
settle claims with Holocaust survivors to gain regulatory approval
to take over Bankers Trust, released documents Thursday that showed
that it had helped finance the building of Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure occurred as Deutsche Bank, the biggest in
Germany, is under pressure from Jewish organizations and other
groups to open its archives and compensate those who lost property
or lives because of the bank's collaboration with the Nazi
government.
</P>
<P>
   The release is the first time that the bank has acknowledged a
financing role in the death camps, though the bank's involvement in
the Third Reich has never been a secret. The documents were
released by the bank historian, Manfred Pohl, who said they were
recently found in an extensive collection of records.
</P>
<P>
   Although Pohl said his activities were independent from the
management, the release also may have been a signal of good faith
in the talks with the survivors.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to be received that way. The secretary-general of
the World Jewish Congress in New York, Israel Singer, announced
that he would soon meet the bank chairman, chairman, Rolf-Ernst
Breuer, to discuss a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   German officials are scheduled to discuss on Monday a broad
compensation fund for Holocaust survivors with Stuart E. Eizenstat,
the U.S. under secretary of state for business affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank is one of many German companies that face a series
of U.S. class-action suits over survivors' claims. Many of the
biggest industrial companies, including DaimlerChrysler AG, Siemens
AG and Volkswagen AG face claims over their use of slave-labor in
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank faces claims over its role in seizing property and
other wealth from German Jews, as well as its role as Hitler's lead
banker.
</P>
<P>
   Alan G. Hevesi, the New York City comptroller, has promised to
block the bank's $10.1 billion purchase of Bankers Trust Corp.
unless it reaches an agreement over Holocaust claims. Partly
because of political pressure from Hevesi, Switzerland's biggest
banks agreed in the summer to pay $1.25 billion to settle claims
over dormant Nazi-era gold deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank needs U.S. regulatory approval to buy Bankers
Trust. The historical records indicate that the bank provided
construction loans for at least part of Auschwitz. They also
provide evidence of secret accounts controlled by the SS that were
used to transfer money taken from Jews who had been deported or
sent to the death and concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Pohl said that he had identified 10 companies, including the
giant I.G. Farben chemical company, that used loans and bank
credits in connection with building Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Bank also provided a line of credit totaling 400,000
reichsmarks to a small company, W. Riedel &AMP; Son, that built walls,
bridges, floors and roofing at Auschwitz. Because the credit was
secured by accounts receivable, Pohl said, Deutsche Bank managers
knew exactly which projects they were financing and received
regular status reports.
</P>
<P>
   The bank also provided a much bigger line of credit to Farben,
though Pohl said it was difficult to tell how much of that money
was used to build Auschwitz.

PROPOSAL ADVANCES TO SETTLE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS AGAINST AUSTRIAN
BANKS
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AUSCHWITZ-BANK) 
(DW) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A lawyer for two Austrian banks said Thursday that
the institutions are circulating a proposal that could would settle
Holocaust-era claims against the banks.
</P>
<P>
   An American plaintiffs' lawyer, Edward Fagan of New York, said
in an interview that an agreement in principle had been reached
between himself, some Jewish groups and the Austrian institutions,
Bank Austria and Creditanstalt.
</P>
<P>
   But the Austrian banks' lawyer said that while a settlement
proposal is being circulated, all involved in the litigation had
not yet reviewed it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, the banks would turn over documents from
World War II to plaintiffs' attorneys and others involved in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   Both the lawyer for the banks and Fagan said earlier reports
that the banks would pay $92 million to settle the claims were
inaccurate.

 &HT;    Anthrax threats taken seriously, but appear to be hoax
 &HT;    By Jack Warner and Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four shivering NBC employees had to strip in the
middle of Peachtree Street behind makeshift curtains and suffer a
shower of water and bleach in a decontamination trailer Thursday
after they received a letter purporting to contain deadly anthrax
spores.
</P>
<P>
   Similar threats were received at two points in Washington, D.C.,
and at the main post office in Columbus, Ga. The FBI is
investigating all four threats, which appear to be hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   No extraordinary measures were taken at the other three
locations. But the Atlanta Fire Department responded swiftly to the
letter received at the NBC News bureau in Colony Square, blocking
off the Midtown intersection, pulling up a special 30-foot long
trailer and completing the process of full decontamination on four
women before it was decided there was no threat.
</P>
<P>
   All of the threats apparently came in standard business
envelopes. Inside were plastic sheets or bags with dark powdery
substances and typed sheets of paper announcing the presence of
anthrax and a message of some sort. The FBI refused to reveal what
the messages contained.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Ross, spokeswoman for the Postal Service's South Georgia
District, said the envelope received in Columbus contained a letter
in large type that said: ``You have now been exposed to anthrax,''
an additional photocopied page and a small, plastic film-wrapped
parcel containing less than a tablespoon-full of cinnamon-colored
powder.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope, postmarked Independence, Calif., was addressed to
the Postal Service at 3916 Milgen Road, the main post office in
Columbus. The post office is on the northwest side of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Ryan, a field producer for NBC, said when the employee
opening the day's mail saw the note, ``she evacuated the room and
called the FBI, CDC, police and fire.''
</P>
<P>
   There were eight people in the 11th-floor bureau at the time, he
said. Atlanta police dispatched the call as a bomb threat and two
officers responded. When firefighters arrived, Ryan said, they
initially began to remove the employees but quickly changed their
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in space suits came in and sprayed us head to toe with
bleach,'' he said. The two police officers were also sprayed. Late
Thursday, the gray carpet in front of the reception desk had turned
a dingy white.
</P>
<P>
   Hazardous materials officers from the Atlanta Fire Department
took the employees up one floor and ``back to an elevator they had
secured, and down to the street,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   Several employees were taken into the decon trailer and showered
with their clothes on, Ryan said, but then experts apparently
decided that was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters strung tarpaulins between the trailer and a fire
truck to shield the workers and one by one, four women disrobed and
stepped into the shower. As each finished the shower, she stepped
through another door into a warming room and wrapped herself in
sheets to be rushed by ambulance to Grady Hospital. Their clothes
were placed in an air-tight canister.
</P>
<P>
   After the fourth woman was showered, Ryan said, ``they decided
the threat wasn't that serious and the rest of us didn't need to go
through it.'' However, word didn't reach Grady in time to stop the
women from having to undergo yet another decontamination shower. An
Atlanta police officer was also treated at Grady.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official announcement that the envelope was a hoax,
however, and every office in Colony Square received a note warning
that employees who begin to experience ``cough, fever or chest
pressure'' should contact Dr. Joseph Steinberg at CDC. None of the
NBC workers was reporting any symptoms Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Worried employees of American International Group, an insurance
firm that shares the 11th floor with NBC, gathered near the trailer
wanting treatment. Elisha McKinley, one of the AIG workers, said he
was leaving for lunch when two NBC employees burst out of their
office across the elevator hall and said they had ``opened a
package and it had anthrax in it.'' McKinley said he went back into
his office and started getting workers out.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, McKinley said, he and his co-workers were told to go
home, shower thoroughly and wash their clothes in hot water.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth, 10th and 11th floors of Colony Square were evacuated,
but most of the offices in the 24-story building closed for the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The Columbus envelope was opened by Sue Fairley, secretary to
the Columbus postmaster, who routinely opens mail addressed to the
Postal Service there. Fairley did not open the plastic-wrapped
package or read the photocopied material, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said it looked faded, like something that been copied over
and over,'' Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   Fairley and two mail carriers who handled the envelope were
counseled by hazardous materials specialists with the Columbus Fire
Department, who advised them to wash their hands and forearms to
the elbows with chemicals, Ross said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the letters went to the Washington Post and the
Old Executive Office Building, which houses the office of the vice
president and other White House offices. Subsequent field tests by
the FBI found that neither envelope actually contained anthrax. It
was not clear why such a test could not be made in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Elisa Foster declined to say where the NBC
letter was postmarked, but said FBI was treating the threat
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there are threats made through the mail, it's a
federal crime,'' Foster said. ``It's still a serious issue because
we all responded as if it was potentially anthrax. It isn't over.
We're going to investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster said it was too early to determine if one group or person
was responsible for the letters. But Foster said such threats are
common.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happens every day,'' she said. ``This isn't unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Phony threats of anthrax have become the bomb scares of the
'90s, emptying nightclubs, abortion clinics, schools, churches and
federal offices across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Individual targets are also becoming commonplace. Neal Horsley,
a Carrollton man behind the controversial anti-abortion Nuremberg
Files web site, received a letter in November claiming to contain
anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   Horsley underwent a decontamination wash-down. The letter was
ruled a hoax after testing.

TRAVEL AGENCIES PASS A `MILLENNIUM BUG' TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travel agents sighed with relief Thursday as their
computerized-reservation systems passed a key test of processing
reservations for travel in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The country's biggest travel booking systems are programmed to
issue tickets up to 331 days in advance _ meaning that Thursday was
the first time most air travelers could buy tickets to fly on Jan.
1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was fraught with anxiety that the software-coding
problem known as the Y2K bug might crash some systems. Like
companies in other industries, ticket-bookers such as Sabre Group,
Worldspan LP or Galileo International Inc. have far to go before
they can assure all of their computerized networks will operate
smoothly 11 months from now.
</P>
<P>
   The ticketing networks were programmed to use just the last two
digits of each year to keep track of the date. Such programs might
be confused by the `00' of next year, leading to worries the
booking systems might malfunction or shut down as early as Thursday
when asked to issue tickets in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   That could have been hugely expensive. American travelers bought
roughly 182 million air tickets last year, according to Airlines
Reporting Corp. of Arlington, Va. The systems also handle
reservations for cruise lines, hotels and car-rental companies.
</P>
<P>
   But executives at major reservation systems said they processed
tens of thousands of orders without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at it as milestone, and it went very well,''
said Jennifer Hudson, spokeswoman for Dallas-based Sabre Group.
Most of the system is owned by the parent of American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest order, Hudson said, came from a travel agent in
London seeking a return flight for a businessman planning to return
from Los Angeles to Heathrow Airport in London. It was issued as
normal. ``We've tested and re-tested for this date for months
now...but you never really know what's going to happen,'' Hudson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales figures weren't available for Thursday, she said,
but were expected to approximate last year's. On Feb. 4, 1998, the
Sabre system booked about 10,000 reservations for travel on Jan. 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're relieved,'' said Ronnie Hauptman, spokeswoman for
Galileo International Inc. in Rosemont, Ill. The company plans to
spend $25 million fixing its system in a project that won't be
complete until June. But Thursday came as a key test of its
mainframe computers, she said, and it passed without incident.
</P>
<P>
   That reassured travel agents, many of whom have already accepted
deposits from consumers signing up for cruises or ski vacations
over next New Year's weekend. ``It could have been a nightmare if
people weren't able to get flights,'' said James Ashurst, a
spokesman for the American Soceity of Travel Agents in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At Beacon Hill Travel in Boston president Dana Vannasse said he
was heartened the terminals he leases from Sabre worked as
designed. No customers made reservations to fly out Thursday, he
said, but eight clients had already booked trips with Jan. 1 return
dates.
</P>
<P>
   He obtained tickets for them without difficulty. ``Another lady
wants to come back the third and we can't do that for her yet. But
I'm not worried anymore,'' Vannasse said.

PATRIOTS SEEK ASSURANCES ON NEW STADIUM SITE

<P>
   BOSTON _ Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland and New England
Patriots owner Robert Kraft have scheduled a news conference for
Friday in Hartford, but it is unclear if a development agreement
that will legally seal the team's move there will be ready to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the Patriots were pressing for assurances that the
site of a proposed new stadium in downtown Hartford will be cleared
in time for the team to play its first game by the fall of 2002.
But those guarantees were still being hammered out.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of the discussions have been relentless,'' said team
vice president Andy Wasynczuk. ``We've been working `round the
clock, the attorneys have been working 22-hour days to complete the
documentation and we're moving ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland moved swiftly this week to allay growing fears among
team officials that a breakdown in negotiations to move a steam
plant on the proposed stadium site could endanger the construction
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Just how the governor's office would compensate or assure the
Patriots that the site will be clear by the summer of 2000, so that
construction on the $350 million project can begin, remained
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is if we frame the agreement, we've got to be
comfortable,'' Wasynczuk said. ``It's implicit we're moving forward
with something we're comfortable signing.''
</P>
<P>
   The press conference is scheduled for 2 p.m. in the Old
Judiciary Room of the state Capitol, the same place where Rowland
and Kraft signed a Memorandum of Understanding Nov. 19 to move the
team from Foxborough to a site along the Connecticut River.
</P>
<P>
   But a steam plant that provides service to much of downtown
occupies that location and must be moved in order for the stadium
-- and the larger $1 billion redevelopment project known as
Adriaen's Landing -- to be built.
</P>
<P>
   Although the state has not reached an agreement with the steam
plant company, CTG Resources Inc., it appears that the development
agreement will give negotiators more time to find a way to tear
down the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thursday, consumer activist Ralph Nader stepped up
his campaign to derail the Patriots deal. In a letter sent to the
governor's office, Nader predicted the deal will not go forward and
warned Rowland to include sufficient ``escape clauses'' for state
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mounting and multiple forces and problems from many
directions that are confronting this deal will result in the
stadium never being built,'' Nader wrote. ``Here's hoping you will
turn your attention to the state's real needs...''

MUTANT AIDS STRAINS INFECTING THOUSANDS, STUDIES SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Thousands of Americans are being infected with mutant
strains of the AIDS virus that have built-in resistance to the only
drugs doctors now have to attack the microbe, according to two new
reports presented here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, at least one in five newly infected individuals carries
a viral strain resistant to at least one of the three types of AIDS
drugs, while about three percent are infected with viruses
resistant to all three drug classes.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of hard-to-treat AIDS viruses is certain to grow,
said Dr. John Mellors of the University of Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Experience tells us that once resistant virus is there, it
tends to increase,'' Mellors said at the Sixth Conference on
Retroviruses, the type of viruses that cause AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies come only six months after researchers reported
the first evidence that multiply-resistant strains of the human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) had infected individuals in San
Francisco and Geneva, Switzerland. Before then, scientists had
crossed their fingers against the possibility, hoping that the
genetic mutations that allow the virus to elude the drugs would
make them less ``fit,'' or likely to be transmitted from one person
to another.
</P>
<P>
   Now researchers know for certain that those earlier cases were
bellwethers of a rapidly increasing phenomenon. It's a byproduct of
the spectacular success in multidrug treatments for AIDS that have
emerged in the past three years, as the virus responds by
developing mutations that allow it to elude the drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Public health officials had hoped that widespread use of the
drug ``cocktails'' would stem the spread of HIV by making patients
on the new therapies less likely to transmit the virus. But John
Kaplan of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said
that is probably not happening, partly because patients are still
infectious despite the drugs, and because many are not practicing
safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``As patients develop resistance, that probably lowers the
ability of anti-HIV treatment to reduce transmission,'' Kaplan
said.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence comes from two very different and
geographically dispersed populations _ a racially diverse group of
95 active-duty military personnel from bases scattered around the
nation, and 69 largely white men from Boston, Los Angeles, San
Diego, Dallas, and Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The diversity of the two groups suggests the spread of
drug-resistant viruses is a general trend, rather than confined to
certain groups or locales.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 40,000 Americans become infected with HIV each year
_ nearly 110 daily. The new studies suggest that perhaps 23 of
them, or 8,432 a year, are acquiring HIV strains resistant to at
least one class of antiviral drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 3 a day, or more than 1,000 a year, are being infected
with viruses that can elude all three classes of antiviral
medications.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 69 patients in the five-city study, for instance,
seven had viruses that were resistant to at least one protease
inhibitor, the mainstay of current treatment, and four individuals
harbored HIV resistant to all four such protease drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is alarming to public health officials and AIDS
doctors, who fear that treatment options will slip away for a
growing number of newly infected patients.
</P>
<P>
   That already is a growing problem among chronically treated
individuals, whose HIV may not be resistant at first but is able to
acquire drug resistance over time. One study presented here this
week found that one-third of patients who have been taking one of
the original successful multidrug ``cocktails'' saw the virus
reappear in their bloodstreams within three years.
</P>
<P>
   The stubborn resistance problem is causing considerable
uncertainty among AIDS specialists about whether to monitor
patients closely to signs of resistance mutations, using tests that
cost $400 to $900, and what to do if the tests come back positive.
</P>
<P>
   One study presented Thursday showed that patients ``failing'' on
triple-drug therapy did much better if their doctors had access to
information about their resistance profile to guide them in
choosing ``salvage'' therapy.
</P>
<P>
   But the transmission of resistant viruses, as opposed to the
development of resistance within a patient during treatment, poses
a new set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   If a physician doesn't recognize that a new patient harbors
resistant HIV, he is likely to prescribe drugs that fail to
suppress the virus, allowing it to gain the upper hand within the
patient's body. That not only compromises the patient's chances of
successful treatment but permits the virus to acquire more
drug-resistance mutations that could be passed on if patients fail
to practice safe sex.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, several authorities urged that doctors begin
routinely testing new patients' blood with the costly resistance
tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``Routine resistance testing may be critical to selecting
optimal initial treatment regimens,'' said Susan Little of the
University of San Diego, who presented results of the five-city
study.
</P>
<P>
   Currently doctors generally do not screen new patients for signs
of resistance mutations but treat first. Typically, they now
discover a patient has a resistant virus only when the drug regimen
fails to suppress the virus promptly.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after one Boston man had a slow response to a
common triple-drug regimen, Massachusetts General Hospital doctors
discovered he had been infected with a virus that was resistant to
two types of drugs. They switched him to a different drug
``cocktail'' composed entirely of drugs of a third class called
non-nucleosides, which so far have kept his virus below detectable
levels.

&HT;        SANTORUM AND SPECTER WANTED LEWINSKY TO TESTIFY IN
IMPEACHMENT TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Lisa Fine  
 &HT;    c. 1999 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Feb. 4 -- Pennsylvania Senators Arlen Specter and
Rick Santorum will have to settle for videotaped testimony of
Monica Lewinsky in President Clinton's impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the preferences of Republicans Specter and Santorum, the
Senate voted 70-30 against having Lewinsky called as a live witness
before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Once the trial started, Specter vowed not to speak publicly
about it. But before that, he had called for a full trial with
witnesses. On Thursday, Specter voted to have Lewinsky testify.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said the trial will lose an important dynamic by not
having live testimony. By not being able to judge Lewinsky's
demeanor during testimony, Santorum said, senators will not be able
to assess her credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been saying how reluctant Monica Lewinsky was in
saying anything bad about the president. Well, if that is apparent,
and she is a live witness -- a reluctant witness -- anything she
says that is negative will have more credibility,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said videotaped testimony does not offer as complete a
picture as live testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a camera focusing on the puck in a hockey game,''
Santorum said. ``You'd see 90 percent of the game focusing in on
the puck, but you'd miss the interaction of the players and other
key parts of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he did not think his 25 Republican colleagues were
disloyal for joining Democrats in voting against the motion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows that our party is the less political one in
all of this,'' Santorum said. ``It shows everyone is making up his
own mind.'' On Saturday, senators will view videotaped depositions
of the former White House intern, Clinton confidante Vernon Jordan
and White House aide Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   As it is becoming clear the requisite 67 senators will not vote
to remove President Clinton from office, some senators are seeking
alternatives to express their disapproval with his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   But momentum is dying for a ``finding of fact'' resolution which
had been pushed by some Republicans. The proposal would have
accused Clinton of perjury and obstructing justice, but would not
have removed him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he opposes anything short of a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should stick to the script our founding fathers
intended for conviction or acquittal,'' Santorum said.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said the trial is on track for a final vote
by Feb 12.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum does not think the trial has derailed the Senate from
doing legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My days are longer and I'm doing more work on legislation
since I'm here,'' Santorum said. ``I think we are getting more
done, instead of being on recess like the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said his office has been flooded with calls from
constituents who want to make their opinion known, but he will not
vote based on popular opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public doesn't sit in the jury box,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the public will render the final verdict on Santorum.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers say Santorum and other senators who are up
for reelection in 2000 are made vulnerable by how they handle
themselves in the impeachment trial. They say Santorum is in a
difficult position because Pennsylvania elected Clinton twice.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum said he doesn't think about politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it doesn't have an impact on me at all,'' Santorum
said. ``I have to work through what my decision is on each article.
If I do that and I'm honest, I've done my job. The politics of this
are simply not important.''

CHINESE PRO-DEMOCRACY ADVOCATE SENTENCED TO 4 YEARS IN PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A Chinese court Thursday sentenced a pro-democracy
advocate to four years in jail for illegally entering China and
``providing financial assistance for activities endangering state
security,'' his family said.
</P>
<P>
   The man sentenced, Wang Ce, 50, had been living in Spain since
1992 and had sneaked into China last October through Vietnam. He
also studied in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In November, he met with Wang Youcai, a dissident who was
sentenced to 11 years in prison the next month for his involvement
in the fledgling China Democratic Party. At that meeting, Wang Ce
gave Wang Youcai $1,000, which he said was to help cover the living
expenses of a friend who was jobless.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Party, which was founded in June 1998, is a loose
national network of dissidents seeking to promote democratic change
in China and was increasingly active last fall until a government
crackdown stalled its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In December, after tolerating the group's activities for several
months, the Chinese authorities abruptly declared the group to be
an illegal organization, arrested or detained many of its leaders
and sentenced three of its most prominent members _ Xu Wenli, Qin
Yongmin and Wang Youcai _ to prison terms of more than 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Ce is one of a handful of Chinese dissidents overseas who
decided to sneak back into China last fall _ a decision some said
was prompted by what appeared to be the growing momentum of the
Democratic Party. Two others were sentenced to three years in a
labor camp last month.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wang was living in Spain, he is still a Chinese
citizen. Zhang Qiyue, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign
Ministry, said he used forged documents to enter China..
</P>
<P>
   Though severely damaged by the crackdown, members of the China
Democratic Party say they will persevere. Just Thursday, a new
affiliate of the party was established in Hebei province, according
to the Hong Kong Center for Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China. The Democratic Party was also planning a national meeting in
the central city of Wuhan, the center said.

 &HT;    Magazine story may open floodgates for stories on first daughter
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to media coverage of presidential
offspring, the kid gloves have come off.
</P>
<P>
   The new edition of People magazine features a glowing profile of
Chelsea Clinton that her parents are criticizing as a violation of
their 18-year-old daughter's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over six years, the media has understood and respected the
unique situation facing Chelsea as she grows up in the spotlight
focused on her parents,'' the Clintons said in a statement. ``We
have been very grateful for the media's restraint in allowing
Chelsea the privacy that any young person needs and deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons reportedly made a personal plea to block the story
and said they were ``profoundly saddened'' the magazine refused to
honor their wishes.
</P>
<P>
   The story, ``The Ties That Bind,'' examines the close but
complex bond between Chelsea and Hillary Rodham Clinton, one that
has tightened since revelations that President Clinton engaged in
``improper relations'' with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The eight-page cover story does discuss some aspects of her
personal life, such as the breakup with her college boyfriend and
her feelings of betrayal after her father's indiscretion surfaced.
But it's also filled with innocuous details, such as Chelsea
wrapping a blanket around her mother during a beach picnic in 1997.
Even so, that type of information until now has been off-limits by
most mainstream publications.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1992 campaign, Chelsea was sometimes seen on the
stump with her parents. They've kept her out of the public eye
since then, but that's changed in the past year. She has been
photographed on foreign jaunts with her mother and holding hands
with her parents in apparently symbolic gestures of reconciliation
the day after Clinton publicly confessed his affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton biographer David Maraniss said that despite their
efforts to safeguard their daughter's privacy, the president and
Hillary Clinton also have used Chelsea as a political prop.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain hypocrisy here,'' Maraniss told People.
``For the most part, they try to protect her, but when a political
situation requires using Chelsea, they will.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Wallace, managing editor for People, defended the decision
to write about the Stanford University student, who turns 19 on
Feb. 27, because of her increasingly visible profile in recent
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly sensitive to the Clinton's concerns about
their daughter but there is a great deal of admiration for this
mother-daughter relationship,'' Wallace said in a statement.
``Chelsea is nearly 19 years old and a poised young adult. We feel
that because she is an eyewitness to the family drama and
historical events unfolding around her she is a valid journalistic
subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Carter, the middle son of former president Jimmy Carter,
said he believes the People story represents a drastic change in
the rules for covering the first family.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, 48, said press secretary Jody Powell hammered out a
``gentleman's agreement'' with reporters that kept them from
covering his once-shy baby sister, Amy, who was 9 when her dad
became president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal was that the press could take pictures of her on the
first day of school, but not the next day. They left her alone, and
they respected that,'' Carter said. ``Back then I think the press
was a lot gentler than it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Once she left the White House to attend Brown University, Amy
Carter become a celebrity of sorts by getting arrested for
protesting for animal rights. Since then, she has avoided the media
spotlight and lives quietly with her husband in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sister doesn't do press,'' said Carter. ``She's a very
private person now and I think she's going to remain that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea has never been interviewed, although reporters have been
invited to off-the-record dinners with her during foreign trips.
She has only spoken in public overseas, in roundtable discussions
with other young people. Last year, tabloids violated the Chelsea
``no-fly'' zone by reporting on the breakup with her college
sweetheart.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz said the People
story could mark a turning point in mainstream media coverage of
the president's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The People cover story is a big deal because it means the wall
is eroding and it could open the floodgates for media scrutiny and
harassment,'' said Kurtz, adding that his paper rarely writes
stories about Chelsea. ``If I set the rules for how we covered
people, I'd be awfully cautious about descending into the personal
angst of a teen-ager who is trying to grow up outside the glare of
scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   But a public role is not unusual for the children of presidents.
Anna Roosevelt served as substitute hostess for her father. Amy
Carter was trotted out for state dinners and to play the violin for
Egyptian President Anwar Sadat at Camp David. Lyndon Baines
Johnson's then teen-age daughters, Lucy and Linda, made speeches
and kept full public schedules. Barbara Bush's eldest grandchild
introduced her to the 1992 Republican national convention.
</P>
<P>
   But when historian Carl Sferrazza Anthony suggested ``it would
be wonderful'' if Chelsea introduced Hillary Clinton to the
Democrats' 1996 convention, the first lady turned frosty, for the
first time in their many conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said absolutely, unequivocally no. There was not even a
hesitation or consideration of that,'' recalled Anthony, author of
the upcoming ``First Families.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Rainbolt, a professor of media ethics and philosophy
at Georgia State University, said that Chelsea has entered a gray
area between private figure and political celebrity that may be
difficult to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Chelsea has moved herself into the spotlight, and
clearly it has been politically useful for the president to have
this young woman, his daughter, standing by his side,'' Rainbolt
said. ``The press has a right to cover her, but I hope they would
use their rights responsibly and not use it as an excuse to start a
stampede.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter had some advice for Chelsea if she's going to survive in
the White House fishbowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is that she is a remarkable girl and you can't be
incognito if you're the president's kid, so she better learn how to
deal with it.''

   But throughout the day, as senators backed away from one
proposal to have a ``finding of fact'' vote and ditched another to
call Monica S. Lewinsky to testify in person, it seemed the
maverick guest may have expressed the views of others besides
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Senators in both parties have for weeks shown interest in ending
the trial of President Clinton sooner rather than later, and
according to the current schedule, it is supposed to finish by late
next week.
</P>
<P>
   And although a motion to move straight to closing arguments was
rejected almost entirely along party lines, some Republicans
indicated an increasing weariness may have played a part in the
other decisions, which essentially told the House prosecutors it
was time to wrap things up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think it's time we get to a vote and we move on,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Susan M. Collins of Maine, one of the members of the GOP
task force that drafted the finding-of-fact proposal, said there
were ``all different motivations'' for waning Republican support of
her plan. But chief among them was exhaustion _ and fear of
exhaustion among voters back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some who are worried about the political
consequences of dragging out the trial and feel this would add
further delay,'' Collins said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had a similar interpretation of the day's
events. In a written statement, spokesman Joe Lockhart said,
``Today's vote rejecting the House managers' request for live
witnesses indicates the Senate appears ready to bring this trial to
a conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding pressure was Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle,
who continued his ongoing attack on the GOP for the length and
scope of a trial the public clearly does not support. Before
heading into the trial Thursday afternoon, Daschle said, ``The
longer it goes the more it becomes a partisan trial, a Republican
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, predictably, denied political concerns played a
role in the votes on witness testimony or the decision to abandon
the fact-finding proposal. But few concealed their enthusiasm for
ending the trial by Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the pressure is entirely internal,'' said Senator
Gordon Smith, a Republican from Oregon. ``No one needs to twist my
arm to want to get out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Others still turned the tables on Daschle, indicating that
efforts to pass a censure resolution after the votes on the
articles of impeachment would be as time-consuming as the trial
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tired? I'm just doing my job,'' said Senator Ted Stevens, a
Republican from Alaska. ``I think I'm going to get tired of the
subject when it comes back up with a censure resolution. We're
going to get all the way through and finish this, and then people
are going to want to go through it all again with the censure
business. Then I'll be tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert F. Bennett, a Republican from Utah, also pitched
Thursday's votes as nothing unusual, saying lightly that among his
colleagues, ``of course there's a sense of wanting to get this
done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There always has been,'' he said, ``right from the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Llamas, a resident of Washington, D.C., was arrested
shortly after 4:15 p.m. and charged with disruption of Congress, a
misdemeanor with a maximum $500 fine and up to six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Although an arrest was made during the impeachment debate in the
House of Representatives, Llamas' was the first arrest since the
Senate trial began Jan. 7, according to Lt. Dan Nichols of the
Capitol Police.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Senate hurtles toward the finale of the
impeachment trial, the last major question before it is whether it
can find a way to bridge party differences and rebuke President
Clinton even while leaving him in office.
</P>
<P>
   There is a longing in the Senate for something more than a
simple acquittal of Clinton. But finding the right words, the right
formula and the right timing is proving elusive, as the apparent
collapse on Thursday of a Republican ``finding of fact'' proposal
demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of forces ranging from party loyalty to concerns about
history, precedent and the Constitution are pulling the sides
apart.
</P>
<P>
   These forces are intensified, as the Republicans and Democrats
maneuver over competing formulas to chastise the president, by the
desire of each party to protect itself, especially in the 2000
elections, while putting the other at a political disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sen. Phil Gramm, a conservative Texas Republican,
came close to threatening that he would mount a filibuster against
any Democratic move to censure Clinton. ``I think what is happening
here is a great effort by politicans to have it both ways,'' he
charged. ``Anybody who wants to vote another way other than guilty
or not guilty is trying to find political cover.''
</P>
<P>
   So while the parties may yet find common ground next week, it is
also plausible that the impeachment trial could end with Clinton's
acquittal and nothing more _ except a new political-cultural debate
in 2000 over whether the Democrats are the party of sex, lies and
obstruction or whether the Republicans are the party of government
intrusion into private life.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of both parties seem to share a desire to see
Clinton pay some further price for the nation's yearlong ordeal.
Some Democrats do not want their vote against conviction next week
to signal that they condone Clinton's sexual relationship with a
former White House intern and his lies to the nation. And
Republicans do not want to see Clinton celebrate his acquittal and
portray it as a political victory over a partisan impeachment
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very strong majority of both parties that does not
want to see this president get off scot-free,'' said Sen. Robert
Bennett, R-Utah, who is working with two Democratic senators,
Dianne Feinstein of California and Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York, to fashion a censure resolution. ``If we can just find the
right set of words for people to come together, I think there are
80 votes or more for censure,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the rise and fall of the Republican idea for a ``finding of
fact'' shows how difficult this can be. The plan was the brainchild
of Republican moderates who may very well vote not to convict
Clinton but still wanted some way to show to voters _ and the
party's conservative base _ that they thought the president had
committed serious offenses.
</P>
<P>
   So they proposed that the Senate find that Clinton ``willfully
provided false and misleading testimony'' to a grand jury and that
he ``engaged in conduct to delay the discovery and to cover up the
existence of evidence and to alter testimony related to a federal
civil rights lawsuit and a United States grand jury
investigation.'' This finding, which would have required only a
majority vote, was to be part of the permanent impeachment
proceedings. That vote would have been followed by the vote on
conviction and removal, which it is already known will not produce
the 67 votes necessary to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   The idea had a secondary appeal as well for some Republicans.
For it would give some validation to the House Republicans who
impeached Clinton on a near party-line vote. Republican Senators
want to protect themselves, but they are also trying to give some
support to their colleagues in the House, who now hold only a
six-seat majority and could be in danger of losing control of the
House in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the plan ran into a wall of Democratic opposition, in part
because of its permanence in the impeachment record (censure by
contrast could always be repealed in a future Congress, as Andrew
Jackson's was), in part because of questions over whether it would
put Clinton in legal jeopardy in a future prosecution and in part
because of feelings that such a move would be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to aim at President Clinton, and they're going
to hit the Constitution,'' said Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D. And even
some Republicans raised constitutional objections and worried that
such a finding would set a precedent that could encourage
congressional majorities to use impeachment as a political weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A censure resolution could well run into the same kind of
buzzsaw. The language will have to be tough enough to attract
Republicans and yet not so tough that it scares off Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the same Republicans who have doubts about the
constitutionality of the finding of facts, object to censure. And
there are also Republicans who see a censure measure as little more
than a shield to protect Democrats who have spent years trying to
shed the images of the 60s and convince voters that they too
believe in family values.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Appell, a Republican poltical strategist, said he thought
that even though Americans in the short term want the trial of the
president to be over, votes to acquit Clinton would have long-term
political consequences for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to be in such denial that the president of the
United States committed perjury and obstruction of justice,' he
said, ``then we're going to hang it around your neck for all of
eternity. From now on the Democratic Party is the party of perjury
and obstruction of justice.'' As an afterthought he quipped: ``They
are already the party of sex. That's nothing new.''
</P>
<P>
   Prepared for just such a debate and certain from the polls that
they can carry the majority of Americans with them, Democrats can
already see their counter-argument. ``The Republicans are the party
of prying into your personal lives,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
``Your privacy will never be protected by Republicans.''

 (ATTN: Canada)  
 AN ARCTIC MEAL: SEAL MEAT, CORN CHIPS AND PCBs 
 (ART ADV: A graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by calling
888-603-1036 or 888-346-9867.)  By ANTHONY DePALMA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IGLOOLIK, Northwest Territories _ It was early on a Monday
morning, another gray start to a gray day in the Canadian Arctic.
But thinking ahead to providing a hot, nutritious meal for his
family later that day and through the week, Serapio Ittusardjuat
already was defrosting a seal.
</P>
<P>
   It was an entire ringed seal about three feet long that the
Inuit hunter had caught in the fertile waters around the island of
Igloolik and then allowed to freeze in the 30-below temperatures
until he needed it.
</P>
<P>
   But Ittusardjuat (pronounced ee-too-sar-dzoo-wat) was only dimly
aware that the seal was probably contaminated with dangerous
substances like the pesticide DDT and industrial compounds like
PCBs, which are released into the air all over the earth and drift
north.
</P>
<P>
   Once they hit the cold polar regions, the contaminants settle.
They easily seep into the Arctic food chain, and are especially
concentrated in sea mammals like seals that have a thick layer of
fat that stores the dangerous compounds. Scientists have known
about the contaminants for some time, and are most concerned about
the effects on babies and the unborn in the north. But they have
not advised the Inuit to change their diets.
</P>
<P>
   Although the eastern Canadian Arctic is developing rapidly, and
will officially become Canada's third territory in a few weeks,
there still are few alternatives to traditional food in an area as
isolated as this one, 1,200 miles from the North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   What is available at Igloolik's only two stores tends to be
convenience foods, TV dinners and sugary prepared items that are
common in the south but have only recently been introduced in the
north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heart disease and kidney disease were almost nonexistent in
the north,'' said David P. Stone, chairman of a federal government
committee on northern contaminants. ``But when these people take on
a southern diet, they end up getting the same diseases as you or I,
and it tends to be worse.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't do much good to try to place traditional foods
off-limits for people like Ittusardjuat, who hunts every week,
often heading to Baffin Island, where he can shoot caribou for his
family, and for others who cannot hunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about that but I'm not too worried,'' he said,
referring to the reports of contaminants found in the food chain.
``I guess if I shot a caribou near the sludge pond, it might be
different and I might not eat it. Otherwise, I don't think it's a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The Inuit's ability to exploit their surroundings has allowed
them to survive in places like this, a treeless island covered by a
thick cap of snow and ice except for a brief, but glorious, summer.
</P>
<P>
   It also makes them willing to try, and then covet, strange
conveniences like barbecued corn chips, spaghetti in a can and
frozen fried chicken.
</P>
<P>
   Just a generation ago, the Inuit diet was entirely traditional.
But by 1988, a study showed, only a third of the diet was composed
of seal and caribou. The rest was bought in stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only nonperishable items that can travel for long distances
are readily available,'' said Olivier Receveur, a professor of
dietetics and human nutrition at the Center for Indigenous Peoples
Nutrition and Environment at McGill University in Montreal. ``A
gallon of milk will cost more than $5, so most people will use
powdered milk or juice crystals instead of the real thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Receveur is working on one of the most extensive surveys ever
done of dietary habits in the eastern Canadian Arctic. He is
looking at the amount of pollutants the Inuit take in because of
the contaminated traditional foods they eat. For instance, a
bite-sized morsel of raw whale skin, called muktuk, an Inuit
delicacy, has been found to contain more PCBs than Canadian
scientists recommend be taken in a week.
</P>
<P>
   Receveur is trying to measure the degree to which southern
cuisine has distorted diets that had remained unchanged for
thousands of years. ``Our working analysis is that the benefits of
traditional foods will outweigh any risks and should be maintained
as the primary diet of the Inuit people,'' he said. ``But we may
find out that the concentration of contaminants in the food is so
high that it poses too great a danger to the populace.''
</P>
<P>
   People older than 50 can remember when almost every day in the
north was walrus and blubber day. With few implements available in
which to cook, and even fewer spices, recipes tended to be
rudimentary.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they know is how to boil the food,'' said Shawn Wilton,
who cooks at the restaurant in a tiny lodge in Igloolik run by the
Inuit cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   Wilton, a native of Steady Brook, Newfoundland, is married to an
Inuit woman, Tapeesa, and has lived in the north for more than a
decade. ``Hamburgers and chicken, that's what people here want to
eat,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has observed that although many residents of Igloolik do not
have much money, they eat at his restaurant because they don't
really know how to cook southern food. Once, he said, he knew
neighbors who had gone out to buy T-bone steaks, which can cost $14
each in the supermarket. ``My wife went to see them and when she
came back she said, `You'll never believe what they've done with
the T-bone,''' he said. ``They boiled it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the 25,000 Inuit of the eastern Canadian Arctic get ready to
take control of their lives and their land when a territory called
Nunavut becomes operational on April 1, there are many doubts about
how successful they will be in preserving their traditional way of
life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But they remain connected to the land, a relationship most
vividly expressed through the traditional food they eat. Andy
Attagutalukutuk is a 41-year-old furnace repairman and weekend
hunter who had most of a freshly skinned caribou carcass spread out
on the floor of his kitchen. He hacked off a chunk of raw meat from
a leg, and sliced a delicate, plum-colored sliver that he offered a
visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up eating caribou meat, from as far back as I can
remember,'' he said. His father, who first took him hunting on
Baffin Island years ago, recently died of liver cancer, and an
uncle had cancer, too, but he does not believe it has anything to
do with the contaminants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born where the caribou are, and that's probably why I
eat it so much,'' he said. ``If they ever tell us not to eat it
anymore, I guess I would just keep eating it.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
HONOLULU _ A survey of 25 Pro Bowl players shows that Houston is an
overwhelming favorite over Los Angeles for the 32nd NFL franchise.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A vote taken at AFC and NFC practices this week turned out 22-3
in favor of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said last week at the Super Bowl
that owners hope to pick between Houston and Los Angeles at their
spring meetings in March.
</P>
<P>
   Players don't have a vote, which is too bad for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans in Houston seem to be itching for another team,'' San
Francisco 49ers receiver Jerry Rice said. ``They want a team they
can support.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, I think it would be a little more
difficult in Los Angeles. LA's more relaxed. There are so many
things to do there. I don't think the fans in Los Angeles are as
supportive as Houston.''

   Houston has a potential owner in Bob McNair. Houston has $200
million in public money. A retractable-roof stadium is ready to be
built. All McNair needs is for the owners to vote for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston needs a team,'' Dallas Cowboys guard Nate Newton said.
``Houston's on the move. They're ready to build a new stadium. With
the proper stadium and an owner who's going to cater to the fans, I
think things should work in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Houston has everything ready to go, why not take advantage
of it? The people in Houston proved they'd support a team. If an
owner will share a little love, they'll support him.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles is expected to get the team over Houston because it
is the country's second-largest television market. Houston is 11th.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's never worked,'' Newton said about giving the franchise
to Los Angeles because of its television market. ``It didn't work
for the Raiders or Rams. The Raiders left. The Rams left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league should go where it works. And it's proven
that it'll work in Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles has two groups competing for ownership. It doesn't
have public money.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Raiders owner Al Davis has a lawsuit pending about
whether he owns the rights to the Los Angeles market. Davis hopes
to return to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a layman here, but I assume that the bigwigs recognize LA
as a place that ought to have a team,'' 49ers quarterback Steve
Young said. ``I would think every effort would be made to put a
team in Los Angeles, because it's a money game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, it's not like the Olympics. Hopefully, it'll be
based on merit. If it's based on merit, Houston maybe should get
it. From things I hear in the wind, they (the league) want $1
billion or more (for the stadium and expansion fee).
</P>
<P>
   ``In LA, who knows? But if someone in LA comes up with a good
plan, I think that's probably where they'll go.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are aware of what Houston has done to try to get an
expansion franchise to replace the Oilers, who moved to Nashville,
Tenn., after the 1996 season. The Oilers officially become the
Tennessee Titans after Sunday's Pro Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see Houston get it,'' said New York Giants
defensive end Michael Strahan, who played at Texas Southern.
``Houston has great fans. Houston has everything set up and ready
to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Los Angeles is a bigger television market, but there's
more to it than television market. Houston has some of the greatest
fans in the world. I think it should matter how many people are in
the stands. Houston deserves another team. I think Texas deserves
another team. California already has three teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Sinclair, who grew up in
Beaumont, thinks the league understands that Houston let the Oilers
go because of owner Bud Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were showing disrespect for the owner, not the
team,'' Sinclair said. ``It was frustration with the owner, and the
team got caught in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see Houston get another team. It's prepped and
ready to go. Houston's got such a great fan base. I remember when
the Astrodome used to be packed. And Houston's a better place than
Los Angeles as far as quality of living.
</P>
<P>
   ``Houston wants the NFL. I just hope the NFL wants Houston.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Chad Brown, Sinclair's teammate with the Seahawks,
sides with Houston. When he played for Pittsburgh, Brown performed
in front of sold-out crowds in the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm from Los Angeles, and there's a reason LA lost teams,''
Brown said. ``There's just so much going on in LA. There are so
many interests other than football. I think the attitude in LA is,
`Well, we can watch it on TV if we want to watch it at all.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the league should look at it from a people aspect, not
just the size of the television market. Houston was a good place to
play. The stadium was full, and the fans were really loud. I think
Houston probably deserves a franchise a little more than LA.
</P>
<P>
   ``If LA gets the team, they'd better do a great marketing job.
They'd better come up with some really cool shirts. It's a tough
sell in LA because of all the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Vikings defensive tackle John Randle grew up in Hearne
and played at Texas A&AMP;I, now known as Texas A&AMP;M-Kingsville. He
resides in Houston in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it should definitely be Houston,'' Randle said. ``I
think Houston deserves another team. Houston just isn't the same
without the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Texas, and I was a fan of the Houston Oilers. For
Houston to not have a team takes away some of the flair and pride
of Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Cardinals cornerback Aeneas Williams grew up in
Louisiana and played at Southern University. He has family in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both very important markets. I don't think it's fair
to single one out, because both are deserving of teams,'' Williams
said. ``But California already has three teams, and Texas has one,
so maybe Houston should get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee running back Eddie George played his first season in
Houston and was named NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. He never
wanted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked Houston a lot because it's a great city,'' George
said. ``The fan support was great for a long time. I used to watch
the `House of Pain' days on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that we left. I think Houston deserves
another team, and I hope you get one.''

STEVENS PICKS A WINNER OVER SUPER BOWL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY MOSS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Gary Stevens was in Miami last weekend and
had tickets to the Super Bowl. But instead of attending the game,
he returned home to California to ride General Challenge in a
stakes race at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   History will decide if it was a wise decision. Early returns
look encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time Denver was putting away Atlanta, General
Challenge was running away with the Santa Catalina Stakes for
3-year-olds by three lengths, and is now undefeated in three
starts. The gelding is among a cluster of Kentucky Derby contenders
in the stable of trainer Bob Baffert, who also saddled the past two
Derby winners.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens had changed his travel schedule two weeks earlier, after
sitting atop General Challenge at Santa Anita for an awesome
morning workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I worked him, I didn't want to miss a horse of this
caliber to watch a football game,'' Stevens explained.
</P>
<P>
   So after Stevens ran third on Baffert-trained Silver Charm on
Saturday in the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park in suburban Miami,
he hopped a flight back to Los Angeles while Baffert stayed behind
for the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so talented and I have so much confidence in him that I
didn't have any question that he was the best horse in the race,''
Stevens said. ``We just wanted to teach him something, and to me,
mentally, he passed all of the tests. It's just a matter now of
getting him prepared for the big dances.''
</P>
<P>
   The first big dance is the Santa Anita Derby on April 3. The
ultimate goal is the senior prom: the May 1 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said he is loathe to rank his 3-year-olds, then
mentioned that General Meeting probably is no better than third
best in his current Derby pecking order. He already has the early
favorite in Exploit, another unbeaten colt, who runs tomorrow in
the San Vicente Stakes. He has a promising colt named Prime Timber.
His two best fillies, champion-to-be Silverbulletday and Excellent
Meeting, often run faster times than colts.
</P>
<P>
   That pecking order isn't set in stone, though. Just look at last
year. Indian Charlie was the darling of the Baffert barn heading
into Derby week, but his ``other'' horse, Real Quiet, came within a
whisker of sweeping the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I get them ready for the Kentucky Derby,'' said
Baffert. ``And when they turn for home, the good Lord will take
over.''
</P>
<P>
   For choosing General Challenge instead of football, Stevens
earned a check of $6,390, or 10 percent of the owner's share of the
purse. That isn't much more than the illegal street value of a few
choice Super Bowl tickets. But obviously, Stevens is thinking ahead
a few months.
Spotlight
Unbeaten gelding needs smarts to go with speed
Temperence Time, a son of 1980 3-year-old champion Temperence Hill,
vaulted onto the list of early Derby prospects with an impressive
victory Saturday in Oaklawn Park's Dixieland Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   But his trainer, Kenny Smith, knows too much about his
four-for-four gelding to start dreaming yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got tons of talent, he's definitely a runner,'' Smith
said. ``But he's been a challenge, let me put it that way. His main
problem is, he's not as smart as he needs to be. You never know
what the hell he's going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At Oaklawn in December, jockey Tim Doocy was aboard Temperence
Time for a workout when the horse inexplicably made a beeline for
the outside rail. Doocy was tossed to the dirt, and as he lay face
down, he wondered to himself where his misbehaving mount had gone.
Doocy quickly got his answer: Temperence Time stepped on his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horse walked all over him,'' Smith recalled with a
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, Temperence Time showed better judgment in the
Dixieland. He rated just behind the leaders for the first time in
his career before drawing away to a 41/4 length victory. His next
start, said Smith, will be in Oaklawn's one-mile Southwest Stakes
on Feb. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully he won't run out to the outside rail, but who
knows?'' Smith said. ``This is the time of year he's got to step
up. If he'll improve, maybe he can go on and be something special,
because he's got a lot of potential. But it's a slow process.''
NO BLUES FOR FOLSOM Former Dallas mayor and Lone Star Park investor
Bob Folsom owns a minority interest in Puerto Madero, upset winner
over Silver Charm in the Donn Handicap. Folsom didn't attend the
race. He watched on TV. And he said he probably won't make the
overseas flight for the 5-year-old's next scheduled appearance in
the March 28 Dubai World Cup, now a $5 million race. Eddie D.
CLOSING IN Eddie Delahoussaye needs two more victories to become
the 14th North American jockey to record 6,000 victories.
Delahoussaye, 47, will join Bill Shoemaker, Laffit Pincay Jr., Pat
Day, David Gall, Angel Cordero Jr., Jorge Velasquez, Chris
McCarron, Sandy Hawley, Russell Baze, Larry Snyder, Carl
Gambardella, Earlie Fires and John Longden. ON THE TUBE Exploit's
1999 debut tomorrow in Santa Anita's San Vicente Stakes can be
viewed on ESPN from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. as part of the network's
``Road to the Triple Crown Series.'' A NEW TWIST Man-bites-dog
story: Free House is in great shape for Sunday's San Antonio
Handicap at Santa Anita, but his trainer is hurt. Paco Gonzalez,
53, went down in a training accident Wednesday morning while
galloping Free House's younger brother and suffered a fractured
collarbone. INJURY REPORT Out of action: Arrested Dreams and Bet Me
Best. Once-beaten Arrested Dreams, Lone Star's champion
thoroughbred 2-year-old filly of 1998, is to undergo arthroscopic
surgery in Kentucky on both knees and will miss most of the rest of
the year. Bet Me Best came out of his victory in Sunday's Hutcheson
Stakes at Gulfstream with a minor bone chip in his right knee and
will be sidelined until late summer. The seven-furlong Hutcheson
was undefeated Bet Me Best's first race for owners Art and Jack
Preston of Houston, and Bill Casner of Southlake, who purchased him
privately. PASSING OF A LEGEND Paul Mellon's death Monday night at
91 will be felt worldwide in economic and philanthrophic circles,
but breeding and racing was one of the billionaire's lifelong
passions. He trimmed his thoroughbred holdings in recent years, but
his Rokeby Stable was an international force for decades, and in
1993 he got a long-awaited and richly deserved Kentucky Derby
victory with Sea Hero. COMEBACK REPORT Jockey Chris Antley, who
hadn't ridden in 16 months due to weight problems, returned
Wednesday at Santa Anita, and one of his two mounts was
disqualified for interference. Mike Smith, riding again at
Gulfstream Park after missing five months with fractured vertebrae,
won his first race of the year Wednesday in his fourth mount. HE'S
BAAAACK Injury-prone Silver Goblin is ready to run again at Oaklawn
Park. The 8-year-old gelding, who has won more than $1 million and
finished second to Cigar in the 1995 Oaklawn Handicap, hasn't
started since chipping a bone in his right ankle last summer at
Lone Star Park and undergoing surgery.

TECH'S SHARP CLOSES IN ON MILESTONE VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Sometime this month, barring cataclysmic
events yet unforeseen, Texas Tech coach Marsha Sharp will record
her 400th victory.
</P>
<P>
   In her 17th year guiding the Lady Raiders' excellent program,
Sharp stands 395-127 coming off 1998 Big 12 coach of the year
honors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reckon we can get five more?'' Sharp queried.
</P>
<P>
   If the 10th-ranked Lady Raiders (19-2, 8-1) can hold their own
in the last days of playing in leaky Lubbock Municipal Coliseum,
odds are good they indeed can get five more.
</P>
<P>
   Tech turned into the eight-game finishing stretch Saturday by
knocking off Baylor, the first of five games at home in the second
half of conference play, after winning four of five road games in
the first half. After a much-needed mid-week bye, the Lady Raiders
play their first of three roadies at Texas tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   The defending Big 12 champions have been one of the new league's
banner programs. And like all good programs, have proven successful
on the road. Boosted by a remarkable 7-1 road record last season,
Tech has won 17 of 23 away games since the Big 12's inception.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't been easy _ as this season's two-point victories at
Baylor and Oklahoma and a three-point win at Oklahoma State attest.
Certainly not as easy as winning on the road was in the old
Southwest Conference for at least one reason _ proximity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took for granted how easy travel was in the old SWC,''
Sharp said. ``And we were at more of a disadvantage than anyone
else if you think about it. But it doesn't even compare to what we
face in the Big 12. It seems to me like we've been playing Big 12
games for a solid year. It's really a brutal scenario.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech has to be favored then to win its second consecutive
regular-season title for two reasons _ superior depth and the
remaining schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State (15-3, 7-1) still has to play at Nebraska, Kansas
State, Kansas and Baylor. Kansas (16-6, 6-3), like Tech, gets a
second-half schedule break with remaining road games at Missouri,
Oklahoma State and Kansas State _ none being arduous trips for the
Jayhawks, who lost first-half games at ISU, Nebraska and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's second-half schedule, however, does pose a rugged finish
that could send the Lady Raiders into the Big 12 tournament
gasping. They're at Nebraska on a Sunday, at Colorado on a
Wednesday, then finish with the Longhorns on the last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That last week is scary,'' Sharp said. ``Three tough games in
seven days, two long trips. Then we turn around and leave on Monday
for the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of variables involved, but sometimes road
games are more mentally exhausting than physically. I know I feel
older than I am. But then of course, I started doing this when I
was 16, right?'' \Ntagtop:Mike Jones, (817) 390-7760
Texas' Clay no longer just a 3-point bomber
Will Clay was recruited to Texas to fit into former coach Tom
Penders' free-wheeling offense that appeared perfectly suited to
his style. In two years at San Jacinto JC, Clay set a school record
with 112 three-pointers in his freshman season and finished by
setting a career mark of 205 long-range bombs.
</P>
<P>
   This season in a more strict system, Clay's shot has deserted
him. He's connected on only 27 of 100 from beyond the arc, three of
31 in nine Big 12 games. But the Bryan native apparently has shaken
the frustration of dealing with the slump and given indication that
he's going to provide a boost for the Longhorns down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   He had 20 key points in victories over Massachusetts and Texas
A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, we've got guys who can score. So it's not a big thing
for me to score,'' Clay said. ``So, I'm saying how can I make
myself respected on this team? And it's by playing defense, taking
the ball to the hole, handling the rock and taking good shots when
I'm open. And that's the role I'm going to take.''
</P>
<P>
   UT coach Rick Barnes left him little choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `If you want to be a shooter, my job's easy.
You're either making them and you play or you're missing them and
you sit. Or, you can decide you want to be a player and play
defense, rebound and realize you've got some pretty good guys
inside who if you get the ball to are going to get double-teamed
and you'll get all the shots you want.'
</P>
<P>
   ``And Will is starting doing all those things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have called and said if coach Penders was here
it would be different,'' Clay said. ``But I tell them coach Penders
is not here, I'm happy where I am. We're winning, and I feel like
everything else will fall into place.''
EDDIE'S BAFFLED Oklahoma State (16-5, 7-2) has won three in a row
and five of six heading into tomorrow night's crucial battle at
Oklahoma (15-7, 6-3). But the Cowboys shot over 50 percent on
Tuesday against Iowa State for the first time since Dec. 22 and
continue to puzzle coach Eddie Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played the easiest part of our schedule,'' Sutton
proclaimed. ``The rest of our games are winnable, but they're also
losable. Our two best players \RAdrian Peterson, Desmond Mason\S
have been inconsistent, and we're not playing as well as we should
as a team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got me baffled. I don't know why. It's been a strange
episode all year.'' KELVIN'S BUMFUZZLED Oklahoma meanwhile, escaped
Baylor on Wednesday with a 59-58 victory, a win that left Sooners
coach Kelvin Sampson in straits to Sutton's over his team's lapses
in offense. Baylor went on a 15-1 run to overtake OU (55-54) with
1:23 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard an old football coach once use the word
`bumfuzzled','' Sampson recalled. ``I think that's the way I am
now. I'm bumfuzzled.'' NO PLACE LIKE, WHERE? Baylor's Lady Bears
won their first Big 12 road game Wednesday at Texas A&AMP;M, where you
can totally disregard home-court advantage. The Aggies' first-year
coach Peggie Gillom's team (7-12, 2-7) is now 0-4 in conference
games and 2-8 overall in A&AMP;M's shiny new Reed Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great arena, but not for us,'' Gillom said.
</P>
<P>
   Which is good news for tomorrow's visitor. Oklahoma (9-10, 3-6)
is winless in seven road games, 0-4 on the Big 12 road and just
nixed one jinx. Wednesday's 71-69 victory against Texas was their
first in six games decided by two or fewer points. A PALACE ON THE
PLAINS This thought after touring in-progress United Spirit Arena
in Lubbock last week.
</P>
<P>
   Reed Arena is a very nice facility. But because of the seating
configuration, it strikes me as a multi-purpose arena where
basketball is played. Tech's new facility is a basketball arena
where other events can be held. Spectators are going to love this
place and so will the resident teams. Players' lounges include a
hot-tub in addition to therapeutic whirlpools. Individual dressing
areas for the women's team have in-place hair dryers.
</P>
<P>
   And the huge media workroom will feature individual phone lines
and hookups that tap into the university's on-line service.

RED RAIDERS ON THE WAY BACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Just what impact Moses Malone Jr. will have on
Texas Tech's basketball program will be determined in seasons to
come.
</P>
<P>
   But there has already been at least one positive spin as a
result of the January transfer of the 6-foot-3 shooting guard with
the famous basketball lineage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly attracted a lot of media attention,'' Red Raiders
coach James Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   The positive attention brought by Malone's transfer from the
University of Houston seemed to be sorely needed. Dickey's program
has existed under a cloud since the Big 12 tournament in March
1997, when the NCAA declared two players were wrongly certified as
eligible and the university pulled a 19-9 team from consideration
for an NCAA Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moses is definitely a name and the fact that he went to Tech
definitely helps the program,'' said Mike Kunstadt, one of the
state's recognized basketball recruiting experts and publisher of
``Texas Hoops'' newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly gives them a high-profile player. And Tech has
got to start getting the kinds of kids they were getting before
this cloud came over the program. That whole thing was their
undoing. And the thing of it was, the coaches weren't at fault.
They just had to pay the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   The question now becomes whether Dickey can revitalize a program
that won 30 games and advanced to the 1996 NCAA Tournament round of
Sweet 16 and would have made another appearance in '97 if not for a
since-rescinded Big 12 rule that demanded forfeiture of games in
which ineligible players participated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that James is the guy who can
get us back on top in the Big 12,'' Tech athletic director Gerald
Myers said. ``He's the same coach he was in 1996. He's an
outstanding recruiter. And we're going to have one of the most
outstanding on-campus facilities in the country \Rby next season\S.
So I have no doubt that he's going to get this program turned
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``James is in a secure position. Heck yeah, he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey is operating with 11 scholarships this season, 11 next
season and 10 the year after before returning to full strength
(13). But the NCAA issued no other sanctions on the program after
the eligibility inquiry. And Malone said it was Dickey's reputation
as a coach who can develop a player's all-around game that brought
him to Tech, where he is paying his own way until a scholarship
comes open for next fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Dickey is basically the reason why I came,'' said
Malone, who says he also considered TCU, George Washington and
Miami. ``He's a great coach and a great guy who can help me succeed
in my personal goals. Someone who can make me a better player, who
can work on all aspects of my game and help make me a better
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good about the future of the program here. If I didn't,
I wouldn't have come.''
</P>
<P>
   Such things are conjecture, but Dickey and others say Tech lost
several high-profile players while the NCAA took the university's
athletic program apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``That really, really hurt them,'' Kunstadt said.
``\RDuncanville's\S Chris Owens and \RDallas Kimball's\S Jeryl
Sasser are only two players that immediately come to mind who
probably would have gone to Tech if not for the investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Has Tech recovered? The Raiders lost prized recruit Chris Ogden
of nearby Seminole to Texas in November, though Ogden said his
desire to leave the area was almost equal to his attraction to
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' Dickey said with a wry smile. ``At least people can't
use \Rthe investigation\S against us anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty of Tech's eventual penalty also played a factor
in center Tony Battie's decision to enter the NBA draft in the
spring of 1997, rather than play his final year. Battie's presence
alone almost certainly would have prevented the Raiders' slide to
13-14 last season.
</P>

   This season, injuries have restricted Dickey's rebuilding
efforts. But he says, and history testifies, that junior-college
players blossom in their second season. Dickey brought in five last
fall, two of whom have two more years of eligibility after this
one.
</P>
<P>
   Though Malone is far from a polished player, he is a natural
scorer, which is something Dickey sorely needs.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey says he is as committed as he's ever been.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited about the future,'' he said. ``The arena is going
to be outstanding and the league is tremendous in terms of
exposure. We're going to have to be very careful in selecting our
players the next two years. What we've got to do is get back the
eye of the tiger that we had through 1997.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After voting by more than two-to-one not to call
Monica Lewinsky to testify in person at President Clinton's
impeachment trial, the Senate on Thursday approved by a narrower
margin a plan to show ``all or parts'' of her videotaped deposition
during floor arguments on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   That will give the nation its first chance to see and hear her
own account of the illicit affair with Clinton that led to his
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   On the question of taking testimony from Ms. Lewinsky, the vote
was 70-30 against doing so. The Republicans split almost evenly,
with 30 favoring such testimony and 25 opposing it. Geographically,
the ``no'' votes were widely distributed, with a dozen from the
West, five from New England and six from the South. Nor was there
any clearly discernible ideological pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognizing reality,'' as Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., put it,
the House prosecutors or ``managers'' did not even attempt to call
other witnesses. Nor did the White House ask that any of its own be
called.
</P>
<P>
   The other important vote, 62-38, came on the question of using
videotapes in the trial. It was for the most part a party-line
vote, with nine Democrats, mostly self-described mavericks, joining
the Republicans, and two New England Republicans _ Sens. James
Jeffords of Vermont and Olympia Snowe of Maine, who are both much
more liberal than their party _ joining the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate will hear closing arguments from House prosecutors
and White House counsel on Monday. Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi,
the majority leader, said he and his colleagues would begin their
deliberations Tuesday, with the vote on the two articles of
impeachment on Thursday or Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By eliminating the possibility of calling Ms. Lewinsky or any
other witnesses, and by pulling back from the idea of a ``finding
of fact'' that would have accused Clinton of wrongdoing without
finding him guilty, the lawmakers removed two major obstacles to
the early conclusion to a trial that many on Capitol Hill and in
the country at large have grown weary of.
</P>
<P>
   There was a marked air of anti-climax in the chamber on
Thursday. Little ardor or urgency marked the speeches, which did
not come close to filling the time allotted. But in a rare moment
of spontaneity in a carefully scripted trial, a spectator was
arrested and hustled away after he stood in the Senate gallery and
shouted, ``God almighty, take the vote and get it over with.'' He
was identified by the Capitol police as Richard D. Llamas, 48, of
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Six roll-call votes, four of them procedural or largely
symbolic, produced a mixed verdict for the White House, which had
feared more than anything else a subpoena forcing Ms. Lewinsky to
testify in the well of the Senate. But even showing the videotape
of her deposition, taken on Monday, was described by one
presidential lawyer, Gregory B. Craig, as certain to ``add to the
agony, to the embarrassment, and to the humiliation'' already
suffered by Clinton and his family.
</P>
<P>
   There are ``no bombshells'' and ``no explosions'' in the
videotapes, Craig assured the senators.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican prosecutors will use the tapes in describing and
analyzing the deposition of Ms. Lewinsky as well as that of Vernon
Jordan, Clinton's closest confidant, who testified Tuesday, and
that of Sidney Blumenthal, a White House aide, who testified on
Wednesday. The White House will also have the opportunity to use
the tapes in its rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a duel of snippets and excerpts,'' Craig said in
opposing the use of any portion of the videotapes during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors sought to show that the depositions changed the
case. But only Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, who questioned
Jordan, went into specifics. He said that Jordan had testified on a
number of points that he said demonstrated more clearly then before
that Clinton had instigated and overseen the search for a job for
Ms. Lewinsky in New York.
</P>
<P>
   That search is seen by the Republicans as part of a cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson also said, as previously reported, that Jordan had
changed his story about a breakfast he had with Ms. Lewinsky on
Dec. 31, 1997, at the Park Hyatt Hotel here. Previously, he said he
had no memory of it.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Hutchinson said, he not only confirmed that the
meeting had taken place but confirmed that Ms. Lewinsky had talked
to him about copies of some of her notes to the president she was
keeping at her apartment. Ms. Lewinsky has testified that Jordan
told her to go back and make sure they were not there, but
Hutchinson did not mention that point in his presentation. Jordan
reportedly told prosecutors on Tuesday that he did not instruct her
to throw away notes.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ed Bryant, R-Tenn., who deposed Ms. Lewinsky, conceded that
she had been ``very guarded in each response and almost
protective,'' making it hard to develop new evidence in the
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her testimony is clearly tinted and some might even say
tainted,'' Bryant said, ``by a mixture of her continued admiration
for the president, her desire to protect him and her own personal
views of right and wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan of California, who deposed Blumenthal, made
much of the fact that Blumenthal had said flatly that Clinton had
lied to him about the nature of the Lewinsky affair. He asserted
that Blumenthal had ``shed some incredible new light'' on the case,
but he did not make its nature clear.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly frustrated by the managers' inability to build support
for their case in the Senate, Rogan at one point aimed an unusually
sharp dart at his audience. Noting that senators had the
opportunity to view the tapes in a secure room, he said: ``If one
senator has failed to personally sit through this deposition and
every deposition, that senator is not equipped to render a verdict
on the impeachment trial of the president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum also sounded nettled, lecturing the senators on what he
called their ``moral obligation'' to call Ms. Lewinsky as a
witness.
</P>
<P>
   In his portion of the argument, Rep. Lindsey Graham of South
Carolina reassured the Senate that the managers would respect the
Senate's dignity if they were able to call Ms. Lewinsky to testify
in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us this witness,'' Graham pleaded. ``We will do it in a
professional manner. We will focus on the obstruction. We will try
to do it in a way not to demean the Senate. And we will try to do
it in a way not to demean Ms. Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig did not even deign to reply to the managers' specific
points. Instead, he argued that the Senate and the nation had
already heard and seen enough without releasing the videotapes of
the three witnesses' testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Putting them into the trial record and using them in Saturday's
session, he argued, would mean that ``the pictures, the voices and
the words on these tapes would flow directly and irreversibly into
the life of the nation.'' He cited a poll published in The New York
Times on Wednesday showing that three-quarters of the public did
not want the videotapes released.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view,'' Craig said, ``the Senate has leaned over
backwards to accommodate the managers. We believe that it is time
for the Senate to say that it's time to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the minority leader,
moved that the Senate do exactly that. But the Republicans turned
back his effort on a near-party-line vote, just as they had
rejected an effort last week by Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., to
dismiss the charges.
</P>
<P>
   When both Craig and the managers completed their arguments well
before time ran out, Lott seemed momentarily at a loss as to how to
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had expected that this would take a little bit longer,'' he
said, and the senators laughed, something they have not done very
often lately.

 WHY ROLL THE DICE?  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By FRED BROCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the politicians and lobbyists in Washington strive to score
political or ideological points in the Social Security debate, they
should be aware that people like Edith Chvala are watching them.
Like some economists, she questions the wisdom of staking Social
Security funds on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chvala, 75, lives alone in a mobile home seven miles
southeast of Silver City, N.M., on $703 a month _ $542 from Social
Security and $161 from a pension.
</P>
<P>
   She jokes about being poor, but is quick to point out that she
is blessed with good health. Many older people are in worse
financial shape, she says, often because they are faced with large
prescription bills not covered by Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   As she watches the struggle over Social Security, Ms. Chvala has
come to at least one conclusion: She is not excited about proposals
that would put a portion of the funds, now invested in Treasury
securities, into the stock market _ whether it's President
Clinton's plan for the government to invest the money or the
Republicans' notion of allowing individuals to invest part of their
Social Security tax payments themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a gambler,'' she said. ``It seems like they want to
gamble with our retirement money.''
</P>
<P>
   If Ms. Chvala is cool to the ideas, so is L. Douglas Lee, chief
economist at HSBC Securities in Washington. Unlike many of his Wall
Street brethren, he has reservations about privatization, despite
the billions of dollars it would pump into the stock market. And he
is one of a number of economists who believes that low-ball
economic projections and assumptions have led to erroneous
conclusions that the Social Security system must be ``saved'' or
``fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who is 51, has nothing per se against investing retirement
funds in the stock market. But he points out that the Social
Security system is more than a retirement program, with features
like benefits for the disabled, or for dependent children after the
death of their working parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the government should fund the social welfare aspects
of Social Security,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Privatizing Social Security, he said, won't increase the overall
resources of the economy, but merely shift them around. And it
could drive up interest rates by decreasing the money available to
the Treasury, forcing it to borrow more in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Lee says the conventional wisdom that the current system faces
bankruptcy is ``a little silly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Economic forecasts are wrong a large part of the time,'' he
said. ``We have to be very careful about making major policy
decisions based on projections, especially when other projections,
which are very reasonable, show a very different outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said that putting part of the budget surplus into Social
Security, in effect reducing the federal debt, as President Clinton
has proposed, would build the nation's resources. That would likely
bring economic growth, which would increase payments into the
Social Security fund, he said. He thinks the Republican plan to cut
taxes would only encourage consumption.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we can point to over the last few years that has
had a positive effect on savings has been to reduce the federal
deficit and move into surplus,'' he said. ``This produces growth,
and that's what's going to be needed in order to meet the promises
that have been made to future retirees.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, decisions about Social Security will have direct
effects on real lives of real people _ like Ms. Chvala.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Germany, she came to the United States in 1930, when
she was 7. She grew up in New York, living in Queens and then
Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   She married in 1945 and followed her husband, a construction
worker, around the Northeast. In 1970, they moved to Buffalo, where
she worked as a nurse's aide for 20 years. That job was the source
of her small pension. The couple divorced in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of a son, she moved to New Mexico in 1990, when
she was 67. She used her savings to buy a mobile home and parked it
rent-free on her son's property. The son later divorced and moved
to Arizona, but his former wife allowed Ms. Chvala to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Four times a week, Ms. Chvala drives her 1985 Chevy Blazer to
Western New Mexico University in Silver City, where she swims and
is a volunteer at the school's museum.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks she might qualify for some sort of welfare, but would
rather get by without it, as Social Security lets her do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like my independence,'' she said. ``I don't want to ever
have to live with my children. I am so thankful for my health. My
plan is to just drop dead when the time comes.'' And she would
rather that politicians keep their hands off Social Security in the
meantime.

`SUICIDE DOORS' FIND NEW LIFE IN SAFER FORMS

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7)

 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Car doors hinged at the rear, like the small third door of
Saturn coupes and the rear access doors of many long-cab pickups,
have traditionally been known as ``suicide doors'' among car buffs.
</P>
<P>
   While this design is virtually as old as the closed-cabin car,
the origin of this description is unclear. But it no doubt had
something to do with the dangers posed by doors that could fly open
if a passenger accidentally pulled on the lever-like door handles
of the time.
</P>
<P>
   And if the front-opening door went ajar while the car was
moving, wind could catch the door and fling it back, possibly
throwing the passenger out of the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, if a parked car with suicide doors was sideswiped
while an occupant was getting out, that person could be pinned
between the door and the body; in a similar accident involving a
front-hinged door, the door would be more likely to be sheared off.
</P>
<P>
   Rear-hinged doors _ often those in back, though sometimes in the
front _ were particularly popular in the 1930s, when they showed up
on cars from everyday Fords and Fiats to elite Bugattis and
Rolls-Royces. The doors made it easier for women in dresses to get
out gracefully, and auto designers liked being able to place the
door handles and hinges wherever they wished.
</P>
<P>
   A car with rounded doors or a steeply raked windshield could
have its front doors hinged on the ``B'' pillar _ the support
between the front and rear doors _ more easily than on the ``A''
pillar attached to the windshield.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, suicide doors had pretty much faded away.
Exceptions included the squared-off Lincoln Continentals of 1961-67
and four-door Thunderbirds of 1967-69.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has a similar look when open, Saturn's third door is
different from those old designs in key ways. Like the access doors
of pickups, the Saturn's rear door cannot be opened unless the
front door is open; otherwise, the release is not exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturn's latches, like those of all vehicles, undergo
rigorous testing and must meet federal standards, said Tim Hurd, a
spokesman for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Indeed, Saturn uses interlocking latches that attach to the front
door and to the body, said Beth Miakinin, chief engineer of the
Saturn S-Series.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that people might recall old-time suicide doors when
looking at the Saturn, Ms. Miakinin said the engineering goal was
to make the three-door Saturn as safe as, if not safer than, a
regular coupe by every standard.
</P>
<P>
   To insure that the third door held up in side impacts, a beam,
foam padding and a piece of sheet metal pleated like an accordion
were installed to absorb crash energy. Because there is no B
pillar, the rear door was designed with hefty pieces of sheet metal
to provide added strength, and reinforcements were added to the
rear door hinge.
</P>
<P>
   While the safety agency has not yet crash-tested the three-door
model, Saturn's engineers said they were confident it would measure
up to the two-door equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd said his agency had not received complaints about any
rear-access door now on the market. &QL;

 &HT;    Atlantans giving money for mummies
 &HT;    By Catherine Fox
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The first call came straight from the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Her child had been enthralled with the mummies on a class trip
to the Michael C. Carlos Museum, so an Atlanta mom, who read of the
museum's plea for funds needed to acquire a first-class collection
of ancient Egyptian mummies and coffins, offered to pitch in $100.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Carlos director Tony Hirschel says he's received
about a dozen pledges, ranging from very small amounts up to
$100,000. The contributors want to remain anonymous, and Hirschel
declined to release the total amount of Thursday's pledges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not over yet,'' he cautions. But time is running out. The
Carlos has until the end of today to finish raising $2 million
needed for the purchase. After that, other institutions will be
free to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Hirschel was guardedly optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very encouraging to get all these calls, and it's
wonderful to see the people of Atlanta responding to an initiative
that could mean so much to the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Each phone call puts him closer to securing the 80 artifacts,
including bronzes, clay figurines, pottery, basketry, relief
fragments and canopic jars (containing the mummy entrails). The
collection is housed in a museum in Niagara Falls, Ontario, where
it has been since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The mummies and coffins, spanning 1000 B.C to the second century
A.D., are the most important artifacts in the collection, which was
assembled in the mid-19th century. Egyptologists in Milwaukee and
Boston agreed that their acquisition would put the Carlos on par
with museums like the Metropolitan in New York and the Museum of
Fine Arts, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   What about Emory University itself? Its endowment, $4.1 billion
as of Aug. 31, ranks sixth among American universities. Couldn't it
kick in or even loan its museum the money?
</P>
<P>
   ``Emory's resources are designated and allocated through a
deliberate and thoughtful process,'' says William H. Fox, senior
vice president for institutional advancement. ``Undesignated or
unallocated resources are therefore not readily available. When an
exciting opportunity such as this collection comes to our
attention, we must seek new funding through fund-raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Hirschel, ``This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and
we need to act immediately if we are to take advantage of it.

PARTY HEADS PLAN TOUGH TALK FOR HOUSE GOP AT RETREAT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republicans are in for a harsh assessment of
their political standing this weekend, with their own leaders
telling them they could lose their already slim majority if they do
not better advocate a clear agenda, raise more money and recruit
strong candidates now for the elections in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One of the bearers of the bad news, to be delivered at a
Republican retreat in Williamsburg, Va., that starts on Thursday
night, will be Rep. Thomas Davis of Virginia, the blunt new
chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, the
party's fund-raising arm.
</P>
<P>
   Republican aides said that Davis would tell members that the
historical tide was against them, since they had lost seats in the
last two elections. They said that while the impeachment of
President Clinton had hurt the party for now, it would be less of a
factor in 2000 than if Republicans failed to articulate a clear
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats are beating us on crime, taxes and Social
Security,'' said a top Republican aide who insisted on anonymity.
``We've got to get back on track and redefine who we are. If we
don't, we're dead in the water.''
</P>
<P>
   With an eye on national polls that show their party in
free-fall, Republican members are already expressing concern about
their own re-elections next year. Rep. Brian Bilbray, a moderate
from California who won re-election with 49 percent of the vote in
1998, is spearheading a group he calls ``the majority makers.''
</P>
<P>
   They are the 21 House Republicans who were elected last year
with 53 percent or less of the vote and who need to be re-elected
if the Republicans are to hold their majority in 2000. The
Republicans control Congress with 222 seats, to 211 for the
Democrats. There is one independent and one vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   While Davis is expected to paint a stark picture for
Republicans, his main message will be that the party can turn
things around if everyone works hard to erase the $4 million debt
and unite on a legislative message, he said through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat comes as the Senate's impeachment trial of President
Clinton overshadows all other activity on Capitol Hill, including
attempts by House Republican leaders to roll out legislation. The
leaders are planning to advise members at the retreat that as soon
as the trial ends, they need to try to grab the initiative on big
issues like Social Security and Medicare to win back voter
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll to be unveiled at the retreat shows that voters
prefer Democrats to Republicans in Congress by seven points. The
poll, conducted by the Virginia-based Republican firm of Fabrizio
and McLaughlin, also shows that 46 percent of voters view
Republicans favorably, while 59 percent view Democrats favorably.
</P>
<P>
   The retreat also comes as other party leaders are displaying
growing impatience with congressional Republicans. Gov. George
Pataki of New York, who has complained before that Republicans in
Washington have done a disservice to the party, is embarking on a
national road show to try to restore the party's image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've gotten off on the wrong track,'' Pataki, who
is also exploring his potential as a candidate for national office,
told NBC News on Thursday. ``They haven't come up with a list of
positive changes that are going to improve the country and improve

 &HT;    Aaron played the game right
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Henry Aaron 65 years old? Of course not! He can't be.
He'll always be a kid, rounding second base in that easy home-run
stride. Tipping the cap to the cheering fans. You never saw him
thrust his fist in the air, go into a home run trot, making a big
fuss about himself because he'd hit another ball out of the lot.
And he could have done it 755 times. That just wasn't his style.
</P>
<P>
   If you wanted to see a man play the game the way it was supposed
to be played, you'd pay to go see Henry Aaron. He was always being
compared with Willie Mays, but they were as different as a
Rolls-Royce from a Corvette. Henry was the Rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody once wrote that the difference between Aaron and Mays
was that Aaron's cap fit better. Mays' cap was always flying off,
like part of the act. Flamboyance was no part of Aaron. No
showboating. No ``hotdog'' in him. He was just about as solid as a
ballplayer could be, on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   While he was chasing the Babe Ruth home-run record, the New York
Times dispatched a reporting sleuth to flush out the secrets of the
Aaron ``we didn't know.'' After a couple of weeks of following him
around, the reporter came to the conclusion, ``This man is a
helluva man. He's everything he seems to be.'' So much for
sleuthful reporting.
</P>
<P>
   Once I worked with him producing his autobiography. We made no
attempt to go for sensation. It was mainly growing up and baseball.
He never brought up the subject of civil rights, and it was his
book, complete with signature. It wasn't yet a main thrust of the
times. Later, in another book with another writer, the subject was
indeed prominent, as was the title, ``I Had a Hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, I had done a story for the Saturday Evening Post on a
then-emerging star in Milwaukee, but still a shy, humble,
open-faced lad who had no idea how great he might become. The
clubhouse man had even misspelled the name over his locker. He had
burned up the South Atlantic League on the way up, and in that
story I wrote, ``He led the South Atlantic League in everything but
hotel accommodations.'' That was as close to borderline as I ever
dared.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a single-digit number in his early days as a Brave, a 5.
He decided he wanted two numbers on his back. He just liked the
look and the sound of it, his preference. He settled on 44, and
there must have been something symbolic in it. He hit 44 home runs
in four different seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He was not a picky hitter when he was developing. He'd swing at
a lot of pitches that weren't strikes and turn an amazing number of
them into base hits. Edd Roush, the old Hall of Fame outfielder,
worked around the park during spring training in Bradenton, Fla. He
said, ``I've never seen a player with Aaron's ability to swing at
bad pitches and convert them into hits.'' You would have to say Edd
Roush knew something about hitters.
</P>
<P>
   It seems quite odd that Aaron and Ruth almost share the same
birth date. Today, the 5th, is Aaron's. Ruth was born Feb. 6,
although 39 years earlier. Sort of sobering that he was not around
long enough to see Aaron break his record, nor was Roger Maris
around to see Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa break his.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the night of Aaron's record-breaking, Atlanta was like a
world's fair. Writers and broadcasters had been tracking the chase
even as the 1973 season came to an end. Before one game late in
September, Aaron had told the herd of reporters gathered around
him, ``If I don't hit one tonight, you might as well go home.'' The
game was rained out, and history had to wait.
</P>
<P>
   The 715th homer, hit off Al Downing, has been played and
replayed. It was one of Atlanta's great moments, if not the
greatest. He hit his first off Vic Raschi, the old Yankee
transferred to St. Louis, April 23, 1954. He hit the 755th off Dick
Drago of the Angels July 20, 1976, in County Stadium, fittingly,
where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Now, on this 5th of February, he will be celebrated at the Hyatt
Regency Hotel, having reaching the age of 65, set off by a
distinguishing touch of gray. The years have treated him kindly.

 &HT;    All-star party to celebrate Aaron's 65th
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ So, how exactly do you prepare for dinner with 1,400
of your closest friends _ including the president?
</P>
<P>
   If, like Hank Aaron tonight at the Hyatt Regency Atlanta's
Centennial Ballroom, you're the guest of honor, you sit back and
marvel. Something like an army of technicians, caterers, florists,
designers and volunteer gofers have been running every which way to
create the perfect party. Aaron will be celebrating two big
numbers: his 65th birthday and the 25th anniversary year of his
record-breaking 715th home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a high-end awards show that has a heartbeat,'' says
Rebekah Jones of Atlanta-based Trru Production Services, the
company responsible for running sound and light systems and cueing
the entertainment, which includes the Temptations (Aaron's favorite
music act), pop vocalist Jeffrey Osborne and a chorus of eight
children who have participated in programs funded by Aaron's
Chasing the Dream Foundation _ the charity that's benefiting from
the soldout dinner. ($1.2 million has already been raised.)
</P>
<P>
   Jones also has to make sure 16 guest speakers get to the
microphone on time and don't overstay their allotted two minutes of
toasts and reminiscences. Among guests expected to attend are
baseball's Reggie Jackson, Ernie Banks, Dave Winfield, Frank
Robinson, Ken Griffey Sr. and Sammy Sosa; boxing champ Evander
Holyfield; country singer Charley Pride; the Rev. Jesse Jackson;
and sportscaster Bob Costas.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the event has ballooned since President Clinton
decided to appear. ``With all the VIPs in attendance, we need more
lighting,'' says Jones. ``We're trying to come up with something
that allows the event to maintain its elegance.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones has a crew of 40 and a volunteer staff of 50 to pull off
the job. Trouble is, as she allows, ``The Hyatt Ballroom is booked
about as much as the Fox Theatre.'' By the time her crew can access
the ballroom, technicians will have to cram 12 hours of work into
just under four.
</P>
<P>
   The menu, table settings and color of the flowers _ laid out at
140 tables _ all selected by Aaron's wife, Billye, the gala's chief
organizer, are top secret. But a few details were revealed by
Edmund Faget, director of corporate sales for Event Design Group of
Atlanta. ``People look to us to decorate for an exquisite look,
usually,'' says Faget, whose company often handles private parties
for Ted Turner and did the decor for country singing star Travis
Tritt's recent wedding. To achieve that, the ballroom will be
ringed by 14 neo-classical pedestals _ or torchiers _ constructed
of wrought iron featuring a harlequin pattern. These are wrapped in
creamy chiffon fabric and festooned with flowers and branches
flowering with what Faget called ``plum blossoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Event Design Group is doing all this in the spirit of charity.
If you want the same for your next shindig, the tab would be
$11,900. And you have to give the lamps back the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Bummer, huh? But, hey, you can definitely afford the wine that
will be served. Forest Glen Winery of Sonoma, Calif., donated 40
cases of merlot and chardonnay to the gala at the request of Wine
Institute, a nonprofit organization that promotes the California
wine industry. At $10 a bottle, the merlot is ``soft and easy to
approach,'' says Brian Loomis, spokesman for Forest Glen. And that
chardonnay? ``One hundred percent barrel-fermented. It's a
technique used with the more expensive wines that gives a full,
rich, complex taste.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches for a humble hero.

UNARMED MAN DIES AFTER POLICE FIRE 41 SHOTS AT HIM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unarmed West African immigrant with no criminal
record was killed early Thursday morning by four New York City
police officers who fired 41 shots at him in the doorway of his
Bronx apartment building, police said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday why the officers had opened fire on the
man, at 12:44 a.m. in the vestibule of his building at 1157 Wheeler
Ave. in the Soundview section of the Bronx. The man, Amadou Diallo,
22, who came to America two years ago from Guinea and worked as a
street peddler in Manhattan, died at the scene, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx district attorney's office is investigating the
shooting. But the details of the incident were still murky Thursday
night because there were apparently no civilian witnesses and none
of the police officers involved had given statements to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and neighbors described Diallo as a shy, hard-working
man with a ready smile, a devout Muslim who did not smoke or drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very angry,'' said his uncle, Mamadou Diallo. ``He was a
skinny guy. Why would the police shoot somebody of that nature 30
or 40 times? We see the police, and we give them all the respect we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Demba Sanyang, 39, said: ``We have a very undemocratic
society back home, and then we come here. We don't expect to be
killed by law enforcement officers.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers involved in the shooting were assigned to the
Street Crimes Unit, an elite, aggressive detail responsible for
taking illegal guns of the street. All four officers, who were in
plainclothes, used their 9-millimeter semiautomatic service
pistols, which hold 16 bullets and can discharge all of them in
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the officers, Sean Carroll, 35, and Edward McMellon, 26,
emptied their weapons, firing 16 shots each, said Inspector Michael
Collins, a police spokesman. Officer Kenneth Boss, 27, fired his
gun five times and Officer Richard Murphy, 26, fired four times.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the officers _ Carroll, McMellon, and Boss _ have been
involved in shootings before, which is unusual in a department
where more than 90 percent of all officers never fire their weapons
in the line of duty. In those previous incidents, Carroll and
McMellon were found to have acted properly, police said, and the
case of Boss _ he shot and killed a man said to be armed with a
shotgun on Oct. 31, 1997, in Brooklyn _ is still being reviewed by
the Brooklyn district attorney's office.

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7) 
(af) 
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Necessity is the mother of invention, and for the
Saturn Corp. of General Motors, a rather simple invention is
generating a much-needed lift in sales of its aging car line.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn's coupe and sedan, developed in the 1980s and introduced
in 1990 _ with few significant changes since _ compete in a part of
the market that has been ice-cold. Small-car sales have plunged 20
percent over two years as buyers shifted to sport utilities,
midsize sedans and more luxurious cars.
</P>
<P>
   A midsize Saturn, the L-Series, comes this summer, and yet
another freshening of the small cars is due. Still, the existing
models will not be replaced until the 2003 model year.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, Saturn executives and a group of dealers
held a brainstorming session on what they could do to bolster sales
while they waited for new products. One suggestion came from Stuart
Lasser, who owns three Saturn franchises in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   His eight-year-old son had been complaining about how hard it
was to climb into the rear seat of the two-door model. Why not add
a third door? Lasser asked.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, minivans were arriving with four doors, and
extra doors were being added to extended-cab pickups. At auto
shows, design studies like the Pontiac Rageous and Mercury MC4 _
both of them ostensibly coupes _ had small back doors aimed at
making them somewhat practical.
</P>
<P>
   Within six weeks of Lasser's suggestion, Saturn had engineered a
prototype of a three-door coupe. The model scored well in consumer
clinics, and Saturn decided to put the change into production. As
of November, all Saturn coupes were built with a small, rear-hinged
door behind the driver's door.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Saturn reported a spurt in sales, its first
month-over-month increase since April and one of the few positive
notes in the smal-car market. The gains continued in January, with
coupe sales up 28 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   After a recent test-drive of a Saturn SC2, I was not surprised
that the new coupe was doing so well. Even with the third door,
which is nearly invisible when the doors are closed, the car has
the sporty look that two-door buyers like.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the third door opens new markets: Most Saturn coupe owners
are single, but the three-door may prove attractive to parents with
small children, who like the look but need more practicality.
</P>
<P>
   From the outside, one cannot immediately detect the third door.
Last summer Saturn invited some journalists to a preview of future
products. Unable to ascertain what was different about the coupe on
display, reporters walked around it muttering, ``What's the big
deal?'' under their breath.
</P>
<P>
   Then a Saturn executive opened the driver's door and popped open
the small door behind it. The innovation was suddenly so obvious.
``Why didn't anyone think of that before?'' I blurted _ a line that
Saturn executives seized on to use in advertising.
</P>
<P>
   On close inspection, the outline is evident, but doesn't detract
from the car's swoopy look. The door has no handle, inside or out;
it can be opened only by grasping a small lever exposed when the
front door is opened. The third door _ its window is fixed in place
_ is not particularly convenient for rear-seat passengers, but that
small seat isn't suited for adults anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The extra door is ideal for tossing in a gym bag, a briefcase or
a couple sacks of groceries. It allows children to scurry in
without having to tip the front seats forward, and it lets parents
buckle in their charges without straining their backs.
</P>
<P>
   It is ideal for a driver with a wheelchair, who can swing the
chair in behind the driver's seat after he or she is positioned at
the wheel. With no center pillar, there are no obstacles for
loading or unloading the wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   One suggestion, though: Saturn should consider lighting the area
around the latch, which I fumbled for in the dark when unloading my
children.
</P>
<P>
   Because the third door is so useful, one may wonder why Saturn
didn't add another to the other side. The main reason is the
expense, in a market segment highly sensitive to price, but Saturn
officials say that consumers who want four doors will buy four-door
models _ that is, sedans.
</P>
<P>
   Despite adding the third door, Saturn has lowered prices
slightly for 1999. The SC1 now starts at $12,885; the SC2, with a
bigger engine and nicer trim, opens at $15,445.
</P>
<P>
   Because adding the door meant eliminating the center pillar, the
driver's shoulder belt was relocated from the pillar to the side of
the seat. That works fine as long as the belt remains in the loop
that serves as its guide. But on my test drive, the belt popped out
often and pressed against my throat.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the third door, little has changed on the plastic-bodied,
front-drive, four-passenger coupe. Despite continual efforts to
muffle the engine, including yet another try this year, the Saturn
is still noisy, especially compared with small cars like the Toyota
Corolla.
</P>
<P>
   ``This car is loud,'' my 10-year-old daughter observed. And
aside from the engine roar, at 8 miles an hour an aggravating groan
comes from underneath. After hearing this on two test cars, I asked
Saturn officials about it. They assured me that the abnormal noise
was normal, a routine function involving the anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   The SC1 base model continues to be powered by a
single-overhead-cam four-cylinder engine. Displacing 1.9 liters, it
is rated at 100 horsepower. The uplevel SC2 comes with a
dual-overhead-cam engine that produces 124 horsepower. A five-speed
manual transmission is standard; a four-speed automatic is
optional.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn was among the first small-car makers to offer traction
control, which helps to keep wheels from spinning on slippery
surfaces, and it is still one of the few with this feature. (It is
included with anti-lock brakes.) Having just come through out one
of Michigan's snowiest Januarys on record, I greatly appreciated
the traction control, which turned the coupe into a sport utility
on my unplowed street.
</P>
<P>
   Saturns' hallmarks are economy and reliability rather than
quiet, comfort and performance. The handling is nothing special,
and acceleration is only adequate.
</P>
<P>
   But dealers do, generally speaking, coddle their customers, who
get royal treatment on par with that accorded Lexus owners, who
spend far more. Plus, Saturn stores offer something one can't find
anywhere else: a two-door car that has three doors.  &QL;

 &HT;    Sisters acknowledge help of other families in Brown v. Board
decision
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Benjamin Kline
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Two sisters whose case made school segregation
illegal were in town Thursday to say it wasn't just them.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Brown Thompson, 55, and her sister Cheryl Brown Henderson,
48, of Topeka, Kan., are forever linked by family name to Brown v.
Board of Education, the landmark 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision
that found separate but equal schools unconstitutional and led to
the slow desegregation of schools nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Brown sisters, daughters of the late Rev. Oliver Brown, a
plaintiff in the Topeka lawsuit brought in 1951 by the NAACP, spoke
at Sinclair Community College as part of Sinclair's Black History
Month celebration.
</P>
<P>
   They have formed a Brown Family Foundation and obtained National
Historic Site status for Topeka's former Monroe Elementary School
to promote multicultural awareness and research on equity and
excellence in education.
</P>
<P>
   Part of their personal educational effort, they said, is to
correct ``myth'' that has arisen from the case that started in a
city where black families were widely dispersed, but black children
had to attend all-black schools no matter how close they might live
to white schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``One myth is that our family was the only one involved,'' Brown
Thompson told Sinclair students at an afternoon gathering. ``There
were 12 families.''
</P>
<P>
   In texts and dramas of the events, the late Thurgood Marshall is
portrayed as the battling NAACP attorney who won the case. Marshall
did argue it before the Supreme Court, the sisters said, but a
lawyer named Robert Carter handled the Topeka part. The Brown
family never met Marshall, the sisters said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Life magazine photos of little Linda Brown, standing with
her books in front of her school, made her a national symbol akin
to the ``Little Rock Nine'' blacks trying to attend class at that
city's high school, or Rosa Parks refusing to give up her bus seat
to a white man in Montgomery, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody realized how far-reaching this case
would become,'' Brown Thompson said. She and her sister felt they
received a good education in Topeka schools and did not suffer the
harassment experienced by children in other cities during the civil
rights movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have racial strife,'' she said. ``Efforts to
integrate the teaching staff (Topeka had four black schools, 18
white) were the only problem,'' Brown Henderson said, because they
threatened some teachers' jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Racism today? It depends on the locale, Brown Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The South has a better way,'' she said. ``They come right out
and tell you if they don't like you. The more subtle racism in the
North is more treacherous than blatant racism, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the pattern has come full circle, Brown Henderson
observed. Today black children are bused to ``magnet schools'' or
to more racially balanced schools just as, 45 years ago, they were
bused inconveniently to all-black schools.
</P>
<P>
   The important message for today's young people, Brown Thompson
said: ``It was young people who made a difference'' in the civil
rights movement, most of them parents in their late 20s and early
30s.

CLINTON AND ARAFAT APPEAR AT ANNUAL PRAYER BREAKFAST

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton and Yasser Arafat, partners in
the Middle East peace process and high-voltage generators of
controversy, appeared Thursday at an ecumenical prayer breakfast,
testing the faith and charity of hundreds of guests.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Arafat did not speak, his attendance for the first
time at the annual National Prayer Breakfast touched off a boycott
by some religious groups and members of Congress, who said that he
was not fit to appear at such a gathering because of his suspected
sponsorship of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was received more politely than Arafat by those at the
breakfast, some of whom have publicly condemned the sexual behavior
and deceptive statements that led to his impeachment and trial.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, who has been one of the
harshest Democratic critics of the president's conduct, asked God
to hear Clinton's pleas for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said, ``Lord, may I say a special prayer at this time
of difficulty for our president, that you would hear his prayers,
that you help him with the work he's doing with his family and his
clergy, that you accept his atonement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Steve Largent of Oklahoma, a conservative Republican who
headed this year's prayer breakfast and who voted in December to
impeach Clinton, said that he seldom agreed with the president on
matters of politics and policy. But he said that did not affect his
spirit of Christian brotherhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. President,'' Largent said, ``I may not have voted with you
in the four years I've been in Congress, but I want you to know
that I care for you and love you and that's part of the mystery of
Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   In his brief remarks, Clinton made no mention of his personal or
political troubles, delivering a high-minded appeal for peace and
reconciliation around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his public remarks and later in private, thanked
Arafat for his efforts toward peace with Israel. The president said
that peace is not made among friends, but between enemies, and
requires a willingness to put aside historical grievances and
personal slights. He also paid tribute to Leah Rabin, the widow of
the slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. She also attended
Thursday's prayer session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask you to pray for all of us, including yourself,'' Clinton
said to the 2,600 people who attended the breakfast in the ballroom
of the Washington Hilton, ``to pray that our purpose truly will
reflect God's will; to pray that we can all be purged of the
temptation to pretend that our willfulness is somehow equal to
God's will; to remember that all the great peacemakers in the world
in the end have to let go and walk away, like Christ, not from
apparent but from genuine grievances.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met privately with Arafat for 20 minutes after the
breakfast to discuss the status of the Middle East peace process.
Clinton also met briefly with Mrs. Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   Several members of Congress who customarily attend the prayer
breakfast, which is sponsored by Congress and has been held
annually since 1942, sat out this year's event to protest Arafat's
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Forbes, R-N.Y., said that it was inappropriate to
invite Arafat to such a gathering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very much offended by the presence of Yasser Arafat, who
is a man who has American blood on his hands,'' Forbes said, citing
suspected Palestinian involvement in terrorist acts that killed
American citizens, including the murder of Leon Klinghoffer aboard
the cruise ship Achille Lauro in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   But Largent said that he was not making a political statement by
including Arafat. He said that Benjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli
prime minister, had also been invited but declined because of
scheduling problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is precisely the type of event that people like Arafat
ought to be invited to,'' Largent said. ``The idea of a prayer
breakfast is to bring people together for reconciliation and
healing and forgiveness and talk about those issues that Jesus
taught.''

   LOS ANGELES -- Garden State Newspapers Inc., parent of the Los
Angeles Newspaper Group, which includes the Daily News, and the Los
Angeles Times have jointly acquired California Independent Postal
System (CIPS) Marketing Group Inc., a Southern California-based
provider of alternative distribution services for advertising
preprints.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring CIPS will enable LANG and the Times to offer
integrated weekend delivery to major retail preprint advertisers.
Advertisers will be able, in one stop, to efficiently reach all of
the households in a given ZIP code in Southern California by a
combination of in-paper insertions and unduplicated door-to-door
and direct-mail distribution, the companies said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   CIPS will be jointly operated by LANG and the Times. Other terms
of the acquisition were not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that these developments are good news for our
advertisers,'' said Ike Massey, president and chief executive
officer of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group and publisher of the
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the acquisition of CIPS nor the new weekend delivery
program will affect the vigorous competition between the Times and
LANG,'' Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition significantly enhances the value we offer
advertisers,'' said John C. McKeon, senior vice president of
advertising for the Times. ``We are pleased to be able to have this
opportunity to better serve them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited to be participating in this new program,'' said
Robert A. Ling, chief operating officer of CIPS. ``The combination
of in-paper inserts, direct mail and direct-to-door delivery makes
for a very comprehensive ad buy. There is nothing else quite like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   LANG publishes the Daily News, the Long Beach Press Telegram,
the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, the Pasadena Star-News and the
Whittier Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The Times and LANG's combined Sunday circulation is 1,816,252.
LANG has a Sunday circulation of 455,051, and The Times' Sunday
circulation is 1,361,201.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, LANG newspapers began participating in the Times'
midweek advertising program, Times Direct. Times Direct combines
weekday home-delivered newspaper distribution and mail distribution
of preprinted inserts to reach most of the households in the Los
Angeles Designated Marketing Area (Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura and
San Bernardino counties, in addition to the eastern portion of Kern
County and the western portion of Riverside County).
</P>
<P>
   LANG's participation in Times Direct has significantly increased
the number of newspaper subscribers who receive advertiser inserts,
making the program even more effective and efficient for
advertisers, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   LANG is owned by Garden State Newspapers, with headquarters in
Denver. It is an affiliate of William Dean Singleton's MediaNews
Group.
</P>
<P>
   In January, MediaNews announced the merger of several of its
California newspapers with Donrey Media Group's California
newspapers. When the merger is completed, MediaNews will publish 50
dailies and 119 nondaily publications in 13 states with a daily
circulation of more than 1.7 million and nondaily circulation in
excess of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   MediaNews Group is the nation's seventh-largest newspaper
company.
</P>
<P>
   CIPS Marketing Group is the largest private postal system in the
nation and has been home-delivering advertising materials in the
five-county Southern California area for more than 30 years. The
company delivers directly to more than 2 million households each
week, with a consistent audited delivery rate above 92 percent
(Verified Audit Circulation).

PAINTING INSTEAD OF NUMBERS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, FEB. 7)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Va.)  (af) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Life is strange, which explains why some seemingly easy
resolutions fail and some seemingly impossible dreams come true. At
the outset of a new year, as they take stock of their careers,
readers were asked about both resolutions and dreams. And they
responded with letters and messages that ranged from immediate
wishes to long-term goals.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, 1996, at 38, David Peikon retired from his job as
vice president of sales for Federal Business Products, a printing
company in Clifton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   It was the culmination of a resolution made six years earlier,
when as a printing executive he landed a long-term exclusive
contract with Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized that the financial windfall that might follow would
allow me to achieve financial independence and a chance to pursue
my ultimate dream of a career as a painter,'' Peikon writes from
Bethpage, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He said he put together a plan that included careful financial
planning, elimination of debt and improvement of his self-taught
artistic skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave myself until February 1996 (my 15th anniversary in
business) to achieve my goal,'' he said. ``What followed was a
seven-day-a-week marathon consisting of five days in the office and
two days at the easel.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Peikon had his first solo show. He says his paintings
are selling well, and as 1999 begins, he is represented by a large
art consulting firm and two galleries.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way,'' Peikon writes, ``the motto for my business is
engraved on a charm around my neck _ `Keep within your heart a
place for dreams.' '' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 31, 1996, Barbara Zingman made her resolution for 1997:
better management of work time. She failed. She set the same goal
for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   As a corporate historian, Ms. Zingman must parcel out her work
week among various tasks: research, interviews, archiving and
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, she says, she decided to construct a time line.
Because she operates out of her office as well as her home in
Manhattan, she bought not one but two of those huge wall calendars
with plenty of space to chart each day's activities.
</P>
<P>
   But she also needed a small date book for jotting down
appointments while on the phone, plus a Filofax (useful when she
moves around town seeing clients and doing research) and scheduling
software.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' she says, ``when I finally completed my
by-now intricate time line it was toward the end of February _ the
project completion dates for which I had originally set up my
management tools were long overdue.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There I was, retired from Rutgers University's philosophy
department after 26 years,'' writes Loretta Mazlen Mandel of
Princeton, N.J. Though no longer an administrative assistant and
freshman adviser, she decided to do some substitute teaching at
nearby schools. Then she decided to take on temporary work at the
Bristol-Myers Squibb corporate offices in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the fact that she was, as she puts it, no longer 30
years old, she was invited back again and again.
</P>
<P>
   And then Raymond Joske, director of the company's advanced
health care department, which develops pharmaceuticals, offered her
a full-time job coordinating 20 field representatives who sell to
hospitals and health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mandel writes, ``What totally blew my mind was that here I
was, 68 years old, and being offered the position and a new
career.'' She took the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hat is off to Bristol-Myers Squibb and to Ray Joske for
giving a woman a chance to start or continue a career without
concern for age,'' she writes. ``So get the message out there to
those women who want to stay in the work force later on in life
that there is that chance, if only someone would give it to
them.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition from 1998 to 1999 for me was the realization of
a dream,'' writes Joshua Lipsman. ``On Jan. 1, I started as the
executive director of New York Gay Men's Health Crisis, since 1981
the world's oldest and largest organization serving men, women and
children with HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``By training, I am a physician and a manager with expertise in
public health and preventive medicine. I have spent the past seven
years serving as the director of public health in Alexandria, Va.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that as a government employee, he ``had increasingly
come to feel a lack of integration between my personal identity as
a politically progressive, openly gay man and my career as a
successful civil servant.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he saw an advertisement in a Washington area newspaper
for the GMHC job, Lipsman, now 43, said he was only mildly
interested, just enough to apply.
</P>
<P>
   As the interview process unfolded, he began to realize what a
close fit there was between the job and him.
</P>
<P>
   Finishing his first month on the job, learning and loving every
minute of it, he says, ``I still look in wonder at all these
changes _ new job, new home, new life _ and remind myself that when
one concentrates one's energies on a life's intention, truly much
is possible.''

KING HUSSEIN FLIES HOME TO JORDAN TO DIE
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ King Hussein of Jordan went home on Thursday to die,
leaving the Mayo Clinic by private jet with an American military
escort.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the king, 63, who is suffering from non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, was in critical condition, after a bone marrow transplant
on Tuesday apparently failed. The king, who has been in power since
1952 and has been integral to the peace effort in the Middle East,
wanted to ``die in his own country,'' an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hussein made a triumphal return to Jordan three weeks ago,
pronouncing himself completely recovered, he was the pilot of his
own plane. On his trip home on Thursday, his plane was accompanied
by two American fighter jets, which saw the plane safely from the
clinic in Rochester, Minn., to the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian royal family, in a brief statement read Thursday
night on state television, confirmed only that Hussein had left the
Mayo Clinic and that his destination was the King Hussein Medical
Center, an army hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is obvious what this means,'' said a family
spokesman in Amman, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Various news organizations were reporting that the king had
suffered organ failure, and the Associated Press in Amman reported
that it had received a faxed statement from Hussein's private
physician, Lt. Gen. Samir Farraj, that his condition had ``become
critical due to the failure of the function of internal organs.''
There were no details on the extent of the organ failure.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official said that Hussein's condition
upon leaving the hospital was extremely grave and that it was
believed that he might already be on life support aboard the
aircraft, but the official said he did not have independent
confirmation of that.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian government spokesmen said Thursday night that they
could neither confirm nor deny broadcast reports in the region
citing concerns that the king might not survive the long flight
home.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Jordan indicate that he is returning to die,
presumably on Jordanian soil, rather than in a foreign country, the
administration official said. Already there are said to be plans
for a funeral on Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the king might have lost his long battle with
cancer stunned already shell-shocked Jordanians. During his brief
visit home, he unexpectedly ousted his brother Hassan, who had been
his constitutionally designated successor as crown prince for 34
years. After naming his eldest son, Abdullah, as his chosen heir,
the king abruptly returned to the clinic in the United States on
Jan. 26, barely a week after his joyful homecoming. His doctors
said he was being rushed back to the United States because of a
fever and blood count abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory national mood was punctured, and Jordan's
concerns moved to the future of the country and the health of the
king.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   World leaders, too, expressed concern on Thursday about the
king's condition. President Clinton, speaking at the National
Prayer Breakfast in Washington a few hours before the king's
departure from the United States, said, ``I ask you to pray for our
King Hussein, a wonderful human being, a champion of peace who, I
promise you today, is fighting for his life mostly so he can
continue to fight for peace.'' Yasser Arafat, visiting Washington,
joined the president in prayer.

</P>
<P>
   After Hussein underwent his second bone marrow transplant
operation in Minnesota on Tuesday, there were increasingly
insistent reports in the Israeli press and in regional diplomatic
circles that the operation had failed and that his health was
rapidly deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, however, reports on state television and the local
press stressed initially positive reports that the king's condition
had stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said privately that the king was in good spirits
after the operation, demanding a cigarette over his doctor's
objections and joking with visitors. As recently as Thursday
morning senior officials in Amman were discussing government
projects that would be revived when the king returned home after an
expected recovery period of a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jordanians speaking privately had said they were distressed
and mystified by the uncharacteristic haste and imperiousness with
which Hussein demoted his loyal younger brother and put Abdullah in
line for the throne. Abdullah himself is said to have learned of
the king's decision only one day before it was publicly announced.
</P>
<P>
   As Jordanians were absorbing the news of the king's condition
Thursday night, his sense of urgency and assertion of command
seemed in retrospect not only understandable, but admirable. ``He
knew that he was running out of time,'' said a Jordanian journalist
who had been critical of the palace upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   For the last week Jordan has been gripped by the palace drama of
the sudden transition in the line of succession from the
internationally respected Prince Hassan, 51, to Prince Abdullah,
37, an army brigadier general of considerable personal charm and
professional military accomplishment but almost no experience in
politics or diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, still not universally recognized by the Jordanian
public, had just begun presiding over cabinet meetings and
appearing on television welcoming a parade of foreign well-wishers
from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Arafat to Persian
Gulf sultans. Now Jordanians are confronted with the imminent
possibility of the country's first monarchical succession in 47
years, a prospect unnerving to ordinary citizens here and the
country's neighbors alike.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, however, appears to be assuming his unexpected new
role with a poise and confidence that has surprised some veteran
Jordanian political observers. A boyish 37, he has a self-assured
informality that is a marked contrast to the aloof, intellectual
demeanor of his uncle, Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   He has two other key strengths that differentiate him from his
predecessor as crown prince. As a career soldier, he is said to be
genuinely popular in the military, an institution dominated by the
ethnic Jordanian East Bank minority. And as the husband of a
middle-class Palestinian from the West Bank, he is seen
sympathetically by Jordan's Palestinian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Amman in recent days are known to have been assured
by Crown Prince Abdullah and his aides that Jordanian foreign
policy under a new regime would continue essentially unchanged,
with a continuing commitment to the Middle East peace effort and
eventual statehood for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and
formerly Jordanian West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The prince, who had headed the Jordanian army's respected
special forces unit, is said to have developed warm relations with
senior Israeli military officers with whom he collaborated on
border security and counterterrorism operations.
</P>
<P>
   He also enjoys several close friendships with his generational
counterparts in the royal families of the Persian Gulf states,
relationships that may already be delivering dividends for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait, which suspended diplomatic relations with Jordan after
Jordan sided with Iraq in the Gulf War, informed the new crown
prince that it will be reopening its embassy in Amman. Saudi
officials, who cut off crude exports as a reprisal for Jordan's
Gulf War stance, are now discussing a resumption of oil sales to
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is also well known in the Pentagon, and in key
congressional commitees. His lobbying in Washington for military
aid helped lead to an increase in U.S. security assistance to $75
million in 1998 and a promised $200 million more in the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   But he not a recognized figure to the general public in his own
country, much less in the rest of the Middle East. While Abdullah
maintained a deliberately low profile as a career military officer,
speculation in the region about possible changes in the Hashemite
succession centered more on his younger brothers, Prince Ali, now
23, the eldest son of the late Queen Alia, and Prince Hamzah, 18,
the first-born son of the king and his current wife, Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis are especially anxious as they prepare to mourn a man
who has ruled their neighbor almost since Israel was founded a half
century ago and who has in recent years acquired an almost sainted
status here. The King Hussein whose forces fought Israelis on the
streets of Jerusalem in 1967 has been supplanted in the popular
imagination by the King Hussein whose wrenching funeral oration for
murdered Prime Minister Itzak Rabin solidified his image here as
Israel's one genuine friend in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, though he is presumed to share his father's views, is
almost completely unknown, in a region with a well-developed fear
of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu phoned Abdullah to
congratulate him on his designation as crown prince last week and
announced plans to visit the prince in Amman on Sunday in what
would have been the Israeli leader's first visit to Jordan in
almost two years _ plans that may now have to be postponed.

STUDIO AGREES TO PAY SOME SCREENWRITERS A PERCENTAGE OF A MOVIE'S
PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
  (fe) 
 By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Breaking through a longstanding financial barrier, a
group of Hollywood's top screenwriters announced a highly unusual
collective agreement on Thursday under which Columbia Pictures has
agreed to pay them a portion of the profits of successful movies in
addition to their usual writing fees.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a combination of symbol and substance, because some
of the terms are vague, but it is likely to place heavy pressure on
other studios to match the terms and shift slightly the balance of
power in the movie business toward writers.
</P>
<P>
   A tiny number of writers have received such profit
participation, but in general writers have been rejected from a
share of the profits even though such terms have been common for
years for the top actors, directors and producers. Thursday's
announcement addresses what has been a growing source of bitterness
for the screenwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about dignity as much as anything else,'' said
Nicholas Kazan, one of the negotiators and the screenwriter of
``Reversal of Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   What was perhaps most striking was that the agreement was
negotiated by a small group of highly successful writers, including
the screenwriters of films like ``Field of Dreams,'' ``Dead Poets
Society'' and ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' but it covers any
writer who meets certain fixed criteria, like getting a script
nominated for an Oscar or getting a million dollar fee for a
script. The criteria would cover hundreds of writers in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators had been discussing the idea at regular Thursday
evening dinners for months, but once they got serious, they said,
they insisted that the terms apply equally to other writers and not
just to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement represented a public relations coup for
Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp. Columbia Pictures, which
saw its market share slide considerably last year, is eager to
establish in the intensely competitive and image-obsessed movie
business a reputation as a sympathetic home for talented writers,
and it is now offering something the others are not.
</P>
<P>
   In television, the writer is king, but in the world of film, the
director is considered the primary shaper of the product. There are
a growing number of films released every year, and their costs have
been rising sharply. This deal represents an effort to shift
slightly the balance of power in the business in an effort to
create a product that stands out from the clutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was going to happen at some point,'' said Amy
Pascal, the president of Columbia Pictures. ``If not us, they would
have gone somewhere else.'' She added that the deal was structured
so that it brought to her studio a broad range of new writers who
had not worked there previously and had little downside since it
pays the writers more only on profitable films.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get anything more if we don't make money too,''
said Ms. Pascal. ``This is a win-win for everybody. That's pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, top Hollywood figures like Harrison Ford and Tom
Cruise and directors like Steven Spielberg and James Cameron have
been able to get a share of the profit of their movies. There is no
standard agreement, however, and the studios are notorious for
engaging in accounting practices that transform major box office
successes into what, on paper anyway, look like commercial losers.
But on some major box office successes those ``points,'' as they
are known, can amount to many millions of dollars if the contracts
are negotiated well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been something the studios have been extremely
reluctant to give anyone,'' said Daniel Petrie Jr., a successful
writer who is the president of the Writer's Guild West, which was
not a party to the agreement. ``The studios had been able to
artificially hold the line against writers getting this, and it has
been of great concern to us. In the best tradition of writers
looking out for each other, the key to this is that the people who
negotiated it created something that potentially benefits all
writers who qualify. That's a tremendous accomplishment. It's not
the typical Hollywood image to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, writers who share a credit as a co-author
of a movie will receive 1 percent of the gross profits, and writers
who have sole credit will receive 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, the gross profits are defined as any sums left
after the studio recoups the costs of producing, distributing and
marketing the films. But, significantly, it comes before the studio
pays itself what is known as a distribution fee, which can total as
much as 30 percent of gross box office receipts, and before the
studio pays out points to others, like the director or stars.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current Guild contract, the minimum fee is $82,444,
but on much sought after scripts, the fee has risen to as much as
$4 million, and there are several dozen writers who command minimum
fees of $1 million per script.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Other companies were reluctant to comment publicly, but some
pointed out that at least in some instances this has already been
done. Dreamworks SKG, for instance, announced when it started
several years ago that writers might be offered a share of the
gross profits of films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good for them, but it's something we've been doing for a
while,'' said Terry Press, Dreamworks' head of marketing, who added
that her company had not spelled out firm criteria for who
qualifies for a slice of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Bass, one of the leaders of the group and the screenwriter
of ``Rain Man,'' said: ``I don't think any of us has any idea what
effect this will have in the short run, but in the long run, once
the glass ceiling against writers is broken, the landscape will be
changed forever. Our point is that writers are the one partner who
is not really accepted as a partner. We want more respect for what
we contribute to the film process.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced on Thursday is significant not only
because it insures the select group of writers will receive such
``points,'' but because it establishes certain formal criteria for
the participation. The negotiators of the agreement _ in addition
to Mr. Bass and Mr. Kazan they were Tom Schulman, Frank Pierson and
Phil Alden Robinson, along with an entertainment lawyer, Alan
Wertheimer _ said that more than 200 writers in total would qualify
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, about 35 successful writers agreed to the terms and,
in addition, agreed to provide Columbia Pictures at least one
script each within the next four years. That is known as a blind
commitment, since the subject or style of the script is left open,
and the studio is not obliged to buy the script.
</P>
<P>
   Any writer who qualifies will receive similar terms from
Columbia Pictures: they will receive a fee equal to what they had
received on their last deal, plus the profit participation.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria are: having received a nomination from either the
Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences or the Writers Guild
for top screenplay in any year; having received a regular fee of
$750,000 or more per script; or having received $1 million or more
for a script offered on spec, that is, written without having
received an assignment from a studio.
</P>
<P>
   The writers who negotiated the deal emphasized that, by
including the nominations in the list of criteria, the arrangement
will benefit many women writers, who have traditionally not been
paid as much as men for their scripts.

DIERDORF IS OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Dierdorf is not returning to ABC's ``Monday Night
Football.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a real story.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released through ABC on Thursday, Dierdorf said:
``Yesterday, ABC Sports informed my representatives at The Marquee
Group that no substantial offer to extend my contract would be
forthcoming. Therefore, Sunday's broadcast of the Pro Bowl will be
my last for ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierdorf then repeated the statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, ABC Sports informed my representatives at The
Marquee Group that no substantial offer to extend my contract would
be forthcoming. Therefore, Sunday's broadcast of the Pro Bowl will
be my last for ABC.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, Dierdorf said he is not returning to ``Monday Night
Football.''
</P>
<P>
   Transcripts of Dierdorf's statement may be obtained through
ABC's publicity department.
</P>
<P>
   __ The fallout: In announcing the end of Dierdorf's 12-year
career with the show, an ABC spokesman said it would be premature
to discuss plans for next season's booth arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   No one's ever accused us of being mature, so . . . we have three
suggestions:
</P>
<P>
   __ There's talk that Boomer Esiason will be lured back to the
NFL as a backup quarterback in San Diego. Let him go, too.
</P>
<P>
   __ Forget Sterling Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   __ Bring back Fred ``The Hammer'' Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   Further speculation is Dierdorf, who made nearly $2 million a
year at ABC, will end up back as an analyst on CBS' NFL coverage.
CBS wants to put game-analyst Randy Cross into the New York studio
to revive an otherwise stagnant presentation, which would open a
spot for Dierdorf.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fukuzaki's following: He was born on the Fourth of July in
Southern California, but when he was 3 his family moved to the
tropical paradise of Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated with a bachelor of arts in broadcast journalism
from the University of La Verne, then went back to Hawaii to start
his professional career. Five years later, he joined the KABC
``Eyewitness News'' team as the first Japanese-American sports
anchor in the city's history.
</P>
<P>
   You know him as the roving reporter for ``Monday Night Live,''
the weekend sports anchor of ``Fuk's Follies,'' and now as the
winner of the Daily News' first L.A. sportscaster ``Q-T'' rating
poll.
</P>
<P>
   Please give a warm ``Dating Game'' welcome to Rob Fukuzaki.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 63 reader votes received over the last two weeks,
Fukuzaki not only had the handsomest amount of favorite responses
(29) but also had by far the best overall graded average.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandmother must have bought all the papers,'' said
Fukuzaki when informed of the vote. ``That's flattering.''
</P>
<P>
   But again, it's nothing new. Two years ago, Fukuzaki was
included in a special ``sweeps'' episode of ``Oprah'' on trying to
line up dates for single guys on TV. Fukuzaki said he was picked by
KABC almost by default since everyone else at the station is
married. But he met a girl from Southern California with whom he
still keeps in touch.
</P>
<P>
   But he remains single.
</P>
<P>
   KCBS-Channel 2's Jim Hill probably has a better representation
of voters to take the No. 2 spot with the second-most favorite
responses (22), but KTTV-Channel 11's Randy Kerdoon, after a late
surge of e-mail ballot stuffing, came out with the second-best
graded average. KNBC-Channel 4's Fred Roggin received the
third-most favorite votes, but his overall graded average put him
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   There were, however, a couple of other disturbing findings from
this reader experiment:
</P>
<P>
   __ Only one balloteer _ a lovely woman from Monrovia who
apologized that she didn't see the paper all the time because she
couldn't receive it by subscription in that part of the city _ was
alert enough to recognize that both KCAL-Channel 9's anchors were
COMPLETELY missing from the list.
</P>
<P>
   A year after WE named Channel 9's Tom Murray and John Ireland
the top sportscaster team in L.A., we could say we left both off
this year to see if anyone (outside of KCAL management) would
notice. Fact is, we made the mistake, but then let it play out to
see what would happen.
</P>
<P>
   That reader, by the way, wrote in both Murray and Ireland but
left off current Channel 9 sportsanchor Alan Massengale.
</P>
<P>
   __ Departed KABC Channel 7 celeb Todd Donoho had more write-in
votes giving him the best grade than nine of the guys currently
working. The man who replaced Donoho, Bill Weir, ended up with the
worst graded average.
</P>
<P>
   __ KABC WEATHERMAN Dallas Raines got as many favorable votes
(one, as a write-in) as Newy Scruggs, Kenny Sargent and Steve
Hartman.
</P>
<P>
   __ Not everyone reads directions. In what was to be a women-only
vote to determine the cutest sportscaster in L.A., at least a half
dozen men sent in ballots. And some women voted on Lisa Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, it's L.A. We'll let it slide.
</P>
<P>
   __ You wanna piece of the rock?: Golfer Rocco Mediate, whose
victory at the Phoenix Open on Sunday was his first tour title in
six years, told the San Jose Mercury News he has three words for
radio talk-show host Jim Rome: ``Bring it on.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with making fun of Mediate's first name, Rome, during his
national radio show, talked Monday about the ``boat oar'' Rocco
uses as a putter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't heard anything if he wants to mess with me,'' said
Mediate, at the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am this weekend.
``If he wants to make fun of me, he can do it to my face. Guys like
him, who hide behind a radio microphone or a TV camera, and rip us
. . . they don't have a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it was Rome who got Cleveland's Shawn Kemp to talk
for the first time on both the radio show and Fox's ``The Last
Word'' about being included last May in a Sports Illustrated cover
story about paternity suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it was true and some of it wasn't,'' said Kemp, who
has reportedly fathered seven children with six different women.
</P>
<P>
   After the shows, Kemp told The Cleveland Plain Dealer he decided
to go on radio and TV to get his side of the story out to a
national audience.
</P>
<P>
   __ Any way you slice it: L.A.'s 40.0 rating and 66 share from
Sunday's Super Bowl XXXIII practically mirrored Fox's national
average of 40.2/61.
</P>
<P>
   Local ratings were obviously higher in Atlanta (58.2/79) and
Denver (51.6/83), but from a pure eyeball standpoint, there were
more viewers watching in L.A., since one ratings point here
represents about 50,000 homes. In Atlanta, the nation's
10th-largest market, one point equals 16,700 homes; in Denver, the
No. 18 market, one point equals 12,000 homes. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES -- Garden State Newspapers Inc., parent of the Los
Angeles Newspaper Group, which includes the Daily News, and the Los
Angeles Times have jointly acquired California Independent Postal
System (CIPS) Marketing Group Inc., a Southern California-based
provider of alternative distribution services for advertising
preprints.
</P>
<P>
   Acquiring CIPS will enable LANG and the Times to offer
integrated weekend delivery to major retail preprint advertisers.
Advertisers will be able, in one stop, to efficiently reach all of
the households in a given ZIP code in Southern California by a
combination of in-paper insertions and unduplicated door-to-door
and direct-mail distribution, the companies said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   CIPS will be jointly operated by LANG and the Times. Other terms
of the acquisition were not been announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that these developments are good news for our
advertisers,'' said Ike Massey, president and chief executive
officer of the Los Angeles Newspaper Group and publisher of the
Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither the acquisition of CIPS nor the new weekend delivery
program will affect the vigorous competition between the Times and
LANG,'' Massey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This acquisition significantly enhances the value we offer
advertisers,'' said John C. McKeon, senior vice president of
advertising for the Times. ``We are pleased to be able to have this
opportunity to better serve them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are excited to be participating in this new program,'' said
Robert A. Ling, chief operating officer of CIPS. ``The combination
of in-paper inserts, direct mail and direct-to-door delivery makes
for a very comprehensive ad buy. There is nothing else quite like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   LANG publishes the Daily News, the Long Beach Press Telegram,
the San Gabriel Valley Tribune, the Pasadena Star-News and the
Whittier Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The Times and LANG's combined Sunday circulation is 1,816,252.
LANG has a Sunday circulation of 455,051, and The Times' Sunday
circulation is 1,361,201.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, LANG newspapers began participating in the Times'
midweek advertising program, Times Direct. Times Direct combines
weekday home-delivered newspaper distribution and mail distribution
of preprinted inserts to reach most of the households in the Los
Angeles Designated Marketing Area (Los Angeles, Orange, Ventura and
San Bernardino counties, in addition to the eastern portion of Kern
County and the western portion of Riverside County).
</P>
<P>
   LANG's participation in Times Direct has significantly increased
the number of newspaper subscribers who receive advertiser inserts,
making the program even more effective and efficient for
advertisers, the companies said.
</P>
<P>
   LANG is owned by Garden State Newspapers, with headquarters in
Denver. It is an affiliate of William Dean Singleton's MediaNews
Group.
</P>
<P>
   In January, MediaNews announced the merger of several of its
California newspapers with Donrey Media Group's California
newspapers. When the merger is completed, MediaNews will publish 50
dailies and 119 nondaily publications in 13 states with a daily
circulation of more than 1.7 million and nondaily circulation in
excess of 2 million.
</P>
<P>
   MediaNews Group is the nation's seventh-largest newspaper
company.
</P>
<P>
   CIPS Marketing Group is the largest private postal system in the
nation and has been home-delivering advertising materials in the
five-county Southern California area for more than 30 years. The
company delivers directly to more than 2 million households each
week, with a consistent audited delivery rate above 92 percent
(Verified Audit Circulation).

GRAVELY ILL HUSSEIN FLIES HOME TO JORDAN
</HEADLINE>
 
(SUBS to rewrite hed; no other changes.)  (fe) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.  
c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ King Hussein of Jordan went home on Thursday to die,
leaving the Mayo Clinic by private jet with an American military
escort.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors said the king, 63, who is suffering from non-Hodgkins
lymphoma, was in critical condition, after a bone marrow transplant
on Tuesday apparently failed. The king, who has been in power since
1952 and has been integral to the peace effort in the Middle East,
wanted to ``die in his own country,'' an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   When Hussein made a triumphal return to Jordan three weeks ago,
pronouncing himself completely recovered, he was the pilot of his
own plane. On his trip home on Thursday, his plane was accompanied
by two American fighter jets, which saw the plane safely from the
clinic in Rochester, Minn., to the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   The Jordanian royal family, in a brief statement read Thursday
night on state television, confirmed only that Hussein had left the
Mayo Clinic and that his destination was the King Hussein Medical
Center, an army hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is obvious what this means,'' said a family
spokesman in Amman, who asked not to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Various news organizations were reporting that the king had
suffered organ failure, and the Associated Press in Amman reported
that it had received a faxed statement from Hussein's private
physician, Lt. Gen. Samir Farraj, that his condition had ``become
critical due to the failure of the function of internal organs.''
There were no details on the extent of the organ failure.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official said that Hussein's condition
upon leaving the hospital was extremely grave and that it was
believed that he might already be on life support aboard the
aircraft, but the official said he did not have independent
confirmation of that.
</P>
<P>
   Jordanian government spokesmen said Thursday night that they
could neither confirm nor deny broadcast reports in the region
citing concerns that the king might not survive the long flight
home.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from Jordan indicate that he is returning to die,
presumably on Jordanian soil, rather than in a foreign country, the
administration official said. Already there are said to be plans
for a funeral on Sunday or Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The news that the king might have lost his long battle with
cancer stunned already shell-shocked Jordanians. During his brief
visit home, he unexpectedly ousted his brother Hassan, who had been
his constitutionally designated successor as crown prince for 34
years. After naming his eldest son, Abdullah, as his chosen heir,
the king abruptly returned to the clinic in the United States on
Jan. 26, barely a week after his joyful homecoming. His doctors
said he was being rushed back to the United States because of a
fever and blood count abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   The celebratory national mood was punctured, and Jordan's
concerns moved to the future of the country and the health of the
king.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   World leaders, too, expressed concern on Thursday about the
king's condition. President Clinton, speaking at the National
Prayer Breakfast in Washington a few hours before the king's
departure from the United States, said, ``I ask you to pray for our
King Hussein, a wonderful human being, a champion of peace who, I
promise you today, is fighting for his life mostly so he can
continue to fight for peace.'' Yasser Arafat, visiting Washington,
joined the president in prayer.

</P>
<P>
   After Hussein underwent his second bone marrow transplant
operation in Minnesota on Tuesday, there were increasingly
insistent reports in the Israeli press and in regional diplomatic
circles that the operation had failed and that his health was
rapidly deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
   In Jordan, however, reports on state television and the local
press stressed initially positive reports that the king's condition
had stabilized.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said privately that the king was in good spirits
after the operation, demanding a cigarette over his doctor's
objections and joking with visitors. As recently as Thursday
morning senior officials in Amman were discussing government
projects that would be revived when the king returned home after an
expected recovery period of a few months.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jordanians speaking privately had said they were distressed
and mystified by the uncharacteristic haste and imperiousness with
which Hussein demoted his loyal younger brother and put Abdullah in
line for the throne. Abdullah himself is said to have learned of
the king's decision only one day before it was publicly announced.
</P>
<P>
   As Jordanians were absorbing the news of the king's condition
Thursday night, his sense of urgency and assertion of command
seemed in retrospect not only understandable, but admirable. ``He
knew that he was running out of time,'' said a Jordanian journalist
who had been critical of the palace upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   For the last week Jordan has been gripped by the palace drama of
the sudden transition in the line of succession from the
internationally respected Prince Hassan, 51, to Prince Abdullah,
37, an army brigadier general of considerable personal charm and
professional military accomplishment but almost no experience in
politics or diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, still not universally recognized by the Jordanian
public, had just begun presiding over cabinet meetings and
appearing on television welcoming a parade of foreign well-wishers
from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to Arafat to Persian
Gulf sultans. Now Jordanians are confronted with the imminent
possibility of the country's first monarchical succession in 47
years, a prospect unnerving to ordinary citizens here and the
country's neighbors alike.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, however, appears to be assuming his unexpected new
role with a poise and confidence that has surprised some veteran
Jordanian political observers. A boyish 37, he has a self-assured
informality that is a marked contrast to the aloof, intellectual
demeanor of his uncle, Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   He has two other key strengths that differentiate him from his
predecessor as crown prince. As a career soldier, he is said to be
genuinely popular in the military, an institution dominated by the
ethnic Jordanian East Bank minority. And as the husband of a
middle-class Palestinian from the West Bank, he is seen
sympathetically by Jordan's Palestinian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Amman in recent days are known to have been assured
by Crown Prince Abdullah and his aides that Jordanian foreign
policy under a new regime would continue essentially unchanged,
with a continuing commitment to the Middle East peace effort and
eventual statehood for the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and
formerly Jordanian West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The prince, who had headed the Jordanian army's respected
special forces unit, is said to have developed warm relations with
senior Israeli military officers with whom he collaborated on
border security and counterterrorism operations.
</P>
<P>
   He also enjoys several close friendships with his generational
counterparts in the royal families of the Persian Gulf states,
relationships that may already be delivering dividends for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Kuwait, which suspended diplomatic relations with Jordan after
Jordan sided with Iraq in the Gulf War, informed the new crown
prince that it will be reopening its embassy in Amman. Saudi
officials, who cut off crude exports as a reprisal for Jordan's
Gulf War stance, are now discussing a resumption of oil sales to
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah is also well known in the Pentagon, and in key
congressional commitees. His lobbying in Washington for military
aid helped lead to an increase in U.S. security assistance to $75
million in 1998 and a promised $200 million more in the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
   But he not a recognized figure to the general public in his own
country, much less in the rest of the Middle East. While Abdullah
maintained a deliberately low profile as a career military officer,
speculation in the region about possible changes in the Hashemite
succession centered more on his younger brothers, Prince Ali, now
23, the eldest son of the late Queen Alia, and Prince Hamzah, 18,
the first-born son of the king and his current wife, Queen Noor.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis are especially anxious as they prepare to mourn a man
who has ruled their neighbor almost since Israel was founded a half
century ago and who has in recent years acquired an almost sainted
status here. The King Hussein whose forces fought Israelis on the
streets of Jerusalem in 1967 has been supplanted in the popular
imagination by the King Hussein whose wrenching funeral oration for
murdered Prime Minister Itzak Rabin solidified his image here as
Israel's one genuine friend in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah, though he is presumed to share his father's views, is
almost completely unknown, in a region with a well-developed fear
of the unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu phoned Abdullah to
congratulate him on his designation as crown prince last week and
announced plans to visit the prince in Amman on Sunday in what
would have been the Israeli leader's first visit to Jordan in
almost two years _ plans that may now have to be postponed.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At long last, Monica Lewinsky got some good news
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a friend's apartment in New York, Ms. Lewinsky watched on
live television as the Senate decided not to require her to testify
in person at President Clinton's impeachment trial, which her
lawyers have characterized as ``an unseemly circus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica and her family are pleased that she does not have to go
through the painful and humiliating ordeal of having to testify on
the floor of the Senate,'' said Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Ms.
Lewinsky. ``The Lewinsky family hopes closure will come soon for
everyone else involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky will now grapple with the challenge of getting on
with her life, Ms. Smith and several other friends said.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be easy. Ms. Lewinsky owes more than $1 million in
fees to lawyers and consultants. She has not worked for more than a
year, and has no employment prospects. And one of the few ways she
can chip away at her mountain of debt is to sit down for an
exclusive interview with Barbara Walters of ABC News. Although ABC
is not paying Ms. Lewinsky for the interview, Channel 4 in Britain
has agreed to pay her $600,000 for the foreign rights to the
interview, her associates said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lewinsky cannot participate in the interview without the
permission of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, who has insisted
that she remain silent for now.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky could be required to testify at future court
proceedings involving the president, if Starr seeks an indictment
against Clinton or other targets of his ongoing criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Ms. Lewinsky asked a federal judge to force
Starr's office to grant her permission to begin speaking to the
media. Starr opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   That same week, Starr asked the same judge to require Ms.
Lewinsky to be interviewed by the House managers, drawing criticism
for taking sides in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   After being granted complete immunity from prosecution by
Starr's office last July, Ms. Lewinsky promised to cooperate with
the ongoing criminal inquiry and to testify truthfully in any
forum. Starr included language in Ms. Lewinsky's immunity agreement
that required her to answer questions truthfully before grand
juries ``and in any other executive, military, judicial or
congressional proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said Thursday night that Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers would
ask U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of to give Ms.
Lewinsky the opportunity to speak with Ms. Walters and other news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky spent several hours Thursday speaking with Andrew
Morton, who wrote her book titled ``Monica's Story,'' which is to
be published later this month by St. Martin's Press. Ms. Lewinsky
received a $600,000 advance for the book.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has answered questions on 23 occasions about her
relationship with the president, Ms. Smith and others said Thursday
that Ms. Lewinsky believed that she would have to testify again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the question: Is it really over for her?'' said a close
friend who spoke with Ms. Lewinsky on Thursday. ``Will she be
needed to testify again and again and again?''

HE'S STILL A HUGE HIT, BUT MARSHALL NOW HAS GOALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Grant Marshall conclusively proved his toughness
in junior hockey in the 1990-91 season.
</P>
<P>
   He broke his neck in a game in December, but returned just in
time for the playoffs. Ignoring the potential for further physical
damage, Marshall went after the biggest guy on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first hit was against \REric\S Lindros,'' he said. ``If you
want to see if you can come back from injury, who better than the
biggest guy? I went after him and hit him, and did a 180 face plant
on the ice. It hurt my pride a bit, but my neck was fine. I went
out there and hit some more guys and knocked them on their butt,
and I felt really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine years later, Marshall still is a tough guy. A week ago, he
dropped the gloves with Tampa Bay's Sandy McCarthy. Despite giving
up height and weight, the Stars' 6-foot-1, 193-pound forward held
his own with the 6-3, 235-pound McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always known what my role is, and that's to bring that
physical presence,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Marshall has to bring something else. He's playing
on a scoring line with Joe Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner, and
even getting some time on the power play.
</P>
<P>
   The tough guy has to think about offense, instead of just doling
out hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to bring that extra element, which is more of an
offensive element, to the table,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was skilled enough to be a first-round draft pick of
the Toronto Maple Leafs, and he had 32 goals and 51 assists his
first full season in juniors. But as the seasons went on, he became
a checker, a grinder, an enforcer. A tough guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play with what gets you here and what you do
best,'' Marshall said. ``You still have to bring that grit level
and show up every night.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, Marshall already has nine goals, tying a career
high. He has three game-winning scores, tied with Mike Modano for
second on the team behind Brett Hull's seven. His 15.5 shooting
percentage also is second on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always known I'm talented enough to create plays and
bring a bit of an offensive element to my game,'' he said. ``I know
I can put the puck in the net and create some scoring chances as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   While Marshall has added some offense, his job on the second
line primarily is to play hard, be physical and let Nieuwendyk and
Langenbrunner take care of putting the puck in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part you can't change your game,'' Marshall said.
``For me that's grinding it out, and creating space for Joe and
Jamie. They're great players that you learn a lot from and feed off
of. It makes you want to bring that all-around, hard-nosed grit
level as well as the offensive level.''
</P>
<P>
   The grit level is why Stars coach Ken Hitchcock put Marshall on
the second line. His job is to provide energy, not highlight-reel
goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same role, same player,'' Hitchcock said. ``We're just taking
advantage of his skill level. No change. If it changes, he'll be
going back to the fourth line.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall can put the puck in the net, or set up a teammate with
an assist. He can be a productive part of a scoring line. But in
the final analysis, he's still the same tough guy who once took
that run at Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting more ice time and more of a chance to play, and I
think for the most part I'm making the best of it,'' Marshall said.
``But you've still got to play the game. If that means taking a
punch for the team, or getting into a fight, or doing whatever it
takes, it doesn't matter what line you're on you've still got to do
it.'' KECZMER, GUSEV TAKE TRIP Dan Keczmer and Sergey Gusev headed
to Kalamazoo after practice yesterday for three games with the
Stars' affiliate in the International Hockey League. They'll play
in Kalamazoo tonight and tomorrow, return to Dallas in case they
are needed for the Stars' game against the Colorado Avalanche on
Sunday, then play Tuesday in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   For Gusev, who has played just 14 games, it's a chance to stay
sharp. For Keczmer, it's an opportunity to hasten his transition
from defense to left wing. PRACTICE PRODUCTIVE The Stars practiced
for an hour yesterday, a day after a 90-minute workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had two days of real good jump at practice, real good
tenacity and energy on the ice,'' Hitchcock said. ``We've had good
focus. I think this has been very good for us.''

FEDERAL AUDITORS HIT FOREST SERVICE FOR LAX CONTROL OF LOGGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal auditors have found that the Forest Service
frequently fails to assess, prevent or correct environmental damage
from logging on the national forests.
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting 12 timber projects in the field from 1995 to
1998, the Agriculture Department's inspector general found that all
were deficient and that ``immediate corrective action is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   A new report found that the environmental studies required
before logging was approved were poorly done, the rules to protect
streams and wildlife habitat from undue damage during logging were
not followed, and plans to repair some of the harm after logging
were not carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Roger C. Viadero, the inspector general, reported on Jan. 15 to
Mike Dombeck, the agency's chief, that the review found ``numerous
serious deficiencies.'' Agency officials generally agreed with the
report's conclusions and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The problems not only cause lasting harm to publicly owned
natural resources, the report emphasized, but also cost the
taxpayers money because many timber sales are canceled for
environmental reasons, and the government then must pay penalties
to the timber companies for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   The report put an official stamp on the kind of complaints that
environmental advocates have lodged with the agency for years, and
it was welcomed by groups that are suing the agency in federal
court seeking a complete halt to logging on federal lands on the
ground that it does more environmental harm than economic good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely damaging report to the Forest Service's
case because it shows that Forest Service decisions can be based on
inadequate and incomplete research and analysis,'' said Brian
Dunkiel, a lawyer for Friends of the Earth, one of the groups suing
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The forest service said it is already moving to correct the
problems, ordering every regional forester to send special teams
into the woods to make sure its rules are being enforced
</P>
<P>
   ``This audit is healthy and it is representative of folks'
growing concern about how their forests are managed,'' said
Christopher Wood, the senior policy aid to Dombeck. ``We are
stewards of the public's trust as well as their resources, and it
is unacceptable when we don't comply with our own environmental
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The audit uncovered many problems in the complex paperwork that
accompanies the agency's sales of timber on publicly owned land to
private logging companies. The Forest Service prepares at least
2,000 environmental assessments each year, in which it is required
to document in detail virtually every possible environmental
consequence of each sale. In 1997, the agency sold more than 3
billion board feet of timber for nearly $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The report also disclosed problems in how the logging was
actually carried out. It documented instances of logging too close
to streams, and other cases in which too many trees were felled or
proper steps were not taken to prevent soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the audit was under way, local officials moved to
correct some of the problems the inspectors found, halting several
timber sales because surveys of endangered species had not been
done and because too many trees were being cut.
</P>
<P>
   That proved costly for the agency, which in one such case had to
pay $650,000 to logging companies for breach of contract. Over the
years, cancellations due to improper environmental planning have
cost the agency tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report included several specific examples of the kind of
problems that the auditors believe are pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinch Ranger District in Virginia, where clear-cutting
was usually prohibited within 50 feet of a stream, agency
biologists doubled the buffer strip at one site to protect water
quality because there were many species of endangered mussels
downstream. But inspectors found a clear-cut spot within 15 feet of
the stream, and a survey found that in six of nine spots examined
the buffer strips ranged from 13 feet to 85 feet. The result was
excessive sediment in the water.
</P>
<P>
   In the Laurentian Ranger District in Minnesota, the agency
permitted a 50-acre clearcut even though 30 additional acres were
clearcut on adjacent county land. That oversight meant that the
assessment of cumulative environmental harm, a required document,
was flawed. Similar flaws were found repeatedly at other locations.
</P>
<P>
   In eight out of 12 cases examined, biological evaluations did
not consider all the imperiled species that were known or expected
to live in the forest where logging was to occur. The auditors
found that the evaluations did not consider 364 of the 436
threatened, endangered or sensitive species that could be found in
those areas. One project was described as improving the habitat for
ruffled grouse, and its evaluation stated that no imperiled species
were found there, while the auditors found that 127 threatened,
endangered or sensitive species were either known or likely to live
in the area.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At long last, Monica Lewinsky got some good news
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In a friend's apartment in New York, Ms. Lewinsky watched on
live television as the Senate decided not to require her to testify
in person at President Clinton's impeachment trial, which her
lawyers have characterized as ``an unseemly circus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica and her family are pleased that she does not have to go
through the painful and humiliating ordeal of having to testify on
the floor of the Senate,'' said Judy Smith, a spokeswoman for Ms.
Lewinsky. ``The Lewinsky family hopes closure will come soon for
everyone else involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky will now grapple with the challenge of getting on
with her life, Ms. Smith and several other friends said.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be easy. Ms. Lewinsky owes more than $1 million in
fees to lawyers and consultants. She has not worked for more than a
year, and has no employment prospects. And one of the few ways she
can chip away at her mountain of debt is to sit down for an
exclusive interview with Barbara Walters of ABC News. Although ABC
is not paying Ms. Lewinsky for the interview, Channel 4 in Britain
has agreed to pay her $600,000 for the foreign rights to the
interview, her associates said.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lewinsky cannot participate in the interview without the
permission of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, who has insisted
that she remain silent for now.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky could be required to testify at future court
proceedings involving the president, if Starr seeks an indictment
against Clinton or other targets of his ongoing criminal
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Ms. Lewinsky asked a federal judge to force
Starr's office to grant her permission to begin speaking to the
media. Starr opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   That same week, Starr asked the same judge to require Ms.
Lewinsky to be interviewed by the House managers, drawing criticism
for taking sides in the Senate trial.
</P>
<P>
   After being granted complete immunity from prosecution by
Starr's office last July, Ms. Lewinsky promised to cooperate with
the ongoing criminal inquiry and to testify truthfully in any
forum. Starr included language in Ms. Lewinsky's immunity agreement
that required her to answer questions truthfully before grand
juries ``and in any other executive, military, judicial or
congressional proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said Thursday night that Ms. Lewinsky's lawyers would
ask U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson to give Ms. Lewinsky
the opportunity to speak with Ms. Walters and other news
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky spent several hours Thursday speaking with Andrew
Morton, who wrote her book titled ``Monica's Story,'' which is to
be published later this month by St. Martin's Press. Ms. Lewinsky
received a $600,000 advance for the book.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has answered questions on 23 occasions about her
relationship with the president, Ms. Smith and others said Thursday
that Ms. Lewinsky believed that she would have to testify again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the question: Is it really over for her?'' said a close
friend who spoke with Ms. Lewinsky on Thursday. ``Will she be
needed to testify again and again and again?''

DIVERSITY'S LOSS IN BOSTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Boston School Committee didn't answer the bell for round
three in its fight to maintain a vestige of integration at Boston
Latin School. Instead the committee decided unanimously this week
not to ask the US Supreme Court to rule on the constitutionality of
an admissions policy that used a careful combination of test
scores, grades, and race to build a diverse and highly qualified
student body at the prestigious high school.
</P>
<P>
   The School Committee lost courage after the federal Appeals
Court invalidated a lower-court ruling by US District Judge Joseph
Tauro that supported the city's sensible admissions plan. Civil
rights groups, including the NAACP, feared that the Boston Latin
plan lacked sufficient coherence and documentation. They lobbied
the School Committee not to appeal the case to the Supreme Court in
light of the high court's conservative bent and its recent
rejections of affirmative action for minorities. So on this
critical issue for all Americans, civil rights leaders counsel that
it is best to go underground now and live to fight another day.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is maddening. Contradictory court decisions on
discrimination remedies bang around the country like billiard
balls. The courts and public wrongly equate today's good policies
promoting integration with bad policies of the past that enforced
segregation. School officials cry out for clarity but instead get
advice on strategy. They are told to push a case to the Supreme
Court that looks more like the Bakke decision, which prohibited
racial quotas but left room for universities to consider race,
among other factors, in admissions.
</P>
<P>
   So now the nation is asked to pretend that 11-year-olds who seek
seats for seventh grade in Boston Latin can somehow reveal their
multidimensional personalities in a college-like admissions
process. It's nonsense, of course, but it allows the fiction to
continue that race-based problems in America can be solved solely
by nonracial means.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston School Committee had a chance to walk in the front
door and prove the educational value of diversity. But it flubbed
it. The challenge awaits a braver and better-prepared protector.

TRICKLING DOWN AT LAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Figures from the Commerce Department indicating that real income
rose 5.1 percent last year conceal other welcome news: Over the
last three years, low-income workers have benefited from the
economic boom. The ability of the economy to reward these workers
is strong evidence for the continuation of successful government
policies.
</P>
<P>
   While US economic growth is strong, economic troubles abroad
provide a brake against inflationary expansion, as confirmed by
last year's 1 percent inflation rate, lowest since 1959. The
Federal Reserve was wise to keep interest rates stable this week so
the economy can continue its expansion. The strong economic growth
_ 3.9 percent last year _ argues against the overstimulation of the
proposed tax cuts sought by congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Low-wage workers still make far less than they did in 1979,
according to the Economic Policy Institute, but they have
significantly exceeded the levels of 1989, before the last
recession.
</P>
<P>
   A tight labor market in 1996 through 1998 has forced employers
to raise wages. The gap between the wages of black and white
workers is narrowing after a 15-year period when it widened.
Workers are benefiting from increases in productivity, a gain that
eluded them in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The national median wage _ $11.29 an hour, or $451.16 a week _
is hardly munificent. People at this level or below could use more
help from government to pay for child care, afford health
insurance, buy a home, or educate their children or themselves. If
the economic expansion continues, money ought to be found for these
purposes from increased federal tax revenues. Regional variations
should also be addressed. Massachusetts workers have not yet closed
the gap.
</P>
<P>
   How long the boom will continue is anyone's guess. The
leadership team of President Clinton, Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan, and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin has wisely avoided
anything that would cause the economy to falter. Unless a downturn
comes, it would be folly to change policies that benefit American
workers.

LET'S HOPE NELSON KEEPS US AMUSED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY GALLOWAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Admittedly, Don Nelson amuses me.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, this should be the lowest priority, if any priority
at all, in judging Nelson's attempted rescue effort involving our
local Lost Cause.
</P>
<P>
   But since it's the Mavericks, amusement of the right kind is
actually a large upgrade. Instead of laughing at the whole sorry
situation, and there's been almost a decade of such folly, I now
find myself chuckling along with almost every episode of Life With
Nellie.
</P>
<P>
   The man makes a lot of moves, which translates to a lot of
chuckles. For now, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Nelson is all brass, and it's long been a
personal theory that only the fearless survive in professional
sports. Plus, there's his track record, even if it's now somewhat
ancient, on bringing back NBA franchises from the dead.
</P>
<P>
   This we know. Nelson is in total charge of this tomb. For the
only time in Mavericks history, there's one vote on every
basketball decision made at 777 Sport Street, downtown Dallas. As
the combo general manager-coach, Nelson answers only to himself.
</P>
<P>
   His critics in the NBA, and there are more than several, will
tell you this is the basketball equivalent of Saddam with a nuclear
arsenal. In the end, no one will be left standing.
</P>
<P>
   Local opinion, however, can differ. The demise of the Mavericks
from the late '80s is traceable to a variety of basketball voices
speaking up, but none loud enough to be heard. Nelson provides a
180. He does all the talking, and if what Nelson says and does
turns out bogus, what's there to lose, except more games. Here's a
franchise that has seen 30-plus wins in a season exactly once since
1990.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing, by my scorecard, that no one can save Nelson
except Nelson. Not sidekick son, Donnie. Not Junior Perot, the
owner void of a basketball clue (this is not necessarily a bad
thing). Not Terdema Ussery, Perot's business-side team president.
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, such as the NBA opening on schedule
in early November, this would have been the season of reckoning for
Nelson. By April, enough evidence could have been stockpiled to
either fire him or kiss up to him.
</P>
<P>
   But as an abbreviated season begins tonight for the Mavericks in
Seattle, Nelson has 50 games to play around with, setting up the
team and himself for 1999-2000. Judging any club by what is about
to happen will be extremely risky.
</P>
<P>
   One guy, however, who doesn't look at it that way is Nelson
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no complaints over cramming the 50 games into three
months,'' he said yesterday before boarding the team charter to
Seattle. ``Young guys need practice and repetition, which we won't
have much of, but there's nothing better than games. We have a
bunch of those and they come in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his mass-player shuffling over the last two years,
Nelson can now be held totally responsible for two _ last summer's
acquisition of point guard Steve Nash and the drafting of Dirk
Nowitzki. Along with Michael Finley, this is the future, one way or
the other.
</P>
<P>
   Nash is important because of his position, and also because the
one transaction Nelson whiffed on was dealing point guard Sam
Cassell. Everything else was a direct result of needing to dump
Jamal Mashburn and Jim Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major pieces are now in place, and I'd also add Samaki
Walker to Michael, Dirk, and Nash,'' said Nelson. ``Where we
eventually end up as a franchise will be determined by those
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Nelson's goal for this season seems realistic, until you
consider it's the Mavericks involved:
</P>
<P>
   ``To have something to play for, that's what I want,'' said
Nelson. ``I want to be a playoff contender, and then slip into the
eighth spot, and give these young guys some playoff exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   I'd say, can't do.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson says, ``I think that's a reasonable goal. Just to be in
the hunt is vital to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The league showed the Mavericks absolutely zero respect _ and
why should it _ by scheduling nine of the first 11 games on the
road, with Houston and Utah the Reunion visitors.
</P>
<P>
   That smells of a possible 0-11 start. Even in a ``free '' season
for Nelson, it would be hard to keep chuckling. But above all else,
in the end there will be only one man to blame, or, hopefully,
bless.

SUBSTANCE OVER STYLE IN NEW NBA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Now that Michael Jordan has realized the
grass is greener on the fairways, the NBA title is again available
to the best team instead of simply the best player.
</P>
<P>
   Still hobbling from the lockout, the NBA is faced with the tasks
of replacing Jordan, rejuvenating an apathetic fan base and pumping
air back into its deflated game. A Cliffs Notes version of the
season tips off tonight and in the end, old-school fundamentals
should win out over hip-hop bravado.
</P>
<P>
   Though the NBA and NBC has its fingers crossed that a glitzy
Knicks-Lakers Finals will lure disenchanted fans back to arenas and
televisions, what the league is more likely to get is a breath of
fresh retro air via an old-school matchup of the fundamentally
sound Utah Jazz and Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not the most glamorous or controversial teams, but
they definitely play the best team basketball,'' said Phoenix Suns
guard Jason Kidd. ``New York and the Lakers and some other up-tempo
teams would cause a lot of excitement, but I'm not so sure that
good old-fashioned X's and O's wouldn't be better for us. Nobody
that knows basketball would be surprised to see them \RUtah and
Indiana\S playing in the Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Jordan's departure and the lockout, fans were
nauseated by predictable and stagnant offenses, low-scoring games,
and the off-court legal troubles of Gen-X players.
</P>
<P>
   Though matching the Los Angeles Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal and
Kobe Bryant against the New York Knicks' Latrell Sprewell and
Patrick Ewing would certainly attract coast-to-coast attention, the
general feeling around the league is that nothing will ferry fans
back like fundamental chest passes, basic blocking out, solid
picks, made free throws, clean police blotters and unselfish,
humble play.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, fans who used to watch Jordan are now ready to
watch basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a lot of guys who can do things to get you
excited and out of your seat,'' said Milwaukee Bucks guard Ray
Allen. ``But it's more about teamwork and depth now, things I think
fans love to see too.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking advantage of the fall of the Chicago Bulls' empire, the
Jazz, Lakers, Houston Rockets and San Antonio Spurs in the West and
the Pacers, Knicks and Miami Heat in the East are the favorites in
an irregular season that arrives three months late and 32 games
short.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls are gone, but the bull's eye isn't. It's focused
squarely on the Pacers, who return 12 players from the team that
pushed Chicago to a Game 7 in the Eastern Conference finals last
May. Indiana, which added veteran forward Sam Perkins in free
agency, is using that near miss against the Bulls as motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Offered a consolatory victory parade by the city of Indianapolis
last summer, coach Larry Bird politely declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them we'd take a rain check,'' said guard Reggie
Miller, the star of a starting five that averages 32 years of age
and 11 years of NBA experience. ``There is still an emptiness from
Game 7, but over the summer that disappointment turned into
commitment. We're not underdogs anymore, we're the team to beat.
But that's cool, let's rock and roll.''
</P>
<P>
   With everyone from Jordan to Heat coach Pat Riley tabbing the
Pacers as the East's beast, the Knicks' trio of
Sprewell-Ewing-Allan Houston figures to push New York deep into the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the Lakers appear to be the biggest, strongest,
fastest, quickest and deepest. But as they proved in last spring's
4-0 loss to the Jazz in the West finals, it's a team that loses its
composure in tight situations, misses too many free throws and has
trouble defending teams with patient half-court offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be awesome and intimidating,'' Rockets coach Rudy
Tomjanovich said. ``But in a 50-game season, I don't see anybody
running away with anything.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Lakers grab the spotlight with 24 national television
appearances, the Jazz will try to capitalize on their closing
window of opportunity with the familiar John Stockton-to-Karl
Malone foundation. Utah, which has won 126 regular-season games the
past two seasons, has seen its bench weakened via the departure of
Antoine Carr to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the toughest division in basketball will be the
Midwest, also home to the Rockets and their Hall of Fame trio of
Scottie Pippen-Charles Barkley-Hakeem Olajuwon, and the San Antonio
Spurs, who added experienced shooters Mario Elie, Steve Kerr and
Jerome Kersey to complement their David Robinson-Tim Duncan front
(sky)line.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-open season that should see elite teams winning 40 and
cellar-dwellers like the Los Angeles Clippers struggle to win 10,
the only given is the downfall of the Bulls. With Tim Floyd in Phil
Jackson's coaching chair and Brent Barry in Jordan's shooting guard
spot, the Bulls plummeted from 3-1 favorites in Las Vegas to a
100-1 long shot to win another championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing's for sure,'' Detroit Pistons coach Alvin Gentry
said. ``Nobody's going to feel sorry for the Bulls.''

ONCE AGAIN, MICROSOFT TRIES USING VIDEOTAPE TO DEMONSTRATE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to stop the damage from a disastrous week in
court, the Microsoft Corp. played a new, videotaped demonstration
at its antitrust trial Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-minute video showed James E. Allchin, a senior company
executive, performing live tests and then looking into the camera
and saying that he had proved his point _ that a prototype
government program intended to separate Microsoft's Web browser
from the Windows operating system had really done no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   The program just hid the browser, he showed. Further, he
demonstrated, running the program disabled some other features in
Windows and caused additional problems.
</P>
<P>
   In federal court on Monday, Microsoft had played a long
videotape intended to demonstrate the advantages of integrating a
Web browser with Windows and debunk the government program, written
by a Princeton University professor and two of his students.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last two days, David Boies, the government's lead
lawyer in the antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft, gradually pulled
the tape apart, pointing out numerous technical questions and
errors, until finally Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson declared
Wednesday afternoon that he no longer viewed the tape as reliable
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very troubling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Microsoft gave up and asked for an opportunity to
make a new tape. As soon as court adjourned Wednesday, a Microsoft
spokesman drove to a shopping mall in suburban Landover, Md., and
bought six IBM Thinkpad laptop computers at Comp-USA, for use in
the new effort.
</P>
<P>
   A film crew was hired on short notice, and the computers were
delivered to a conference room at Sullivan &AMP; Cromwell, the law firm
that is representing Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   To assure that the new tape would be viewed as credible, a
government lawyer and the Princeton professor, Dr. Edward W.
Felton, along with his two students, were invited to come by at
8:30 p.m. to witness the taping. But they were not permitted into
the room for two hours, while the Microsoft team unpacked the boxes
and set up the computers _ leading to angry concerns that something
nefarious was under way. The taping was not completed until after
midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in court Thursday why the government representatives were
not let in, Allchin _ normally a low-key unflappable man _ bristled
and said: ``Sir, I was not involved with that, and it would have
been OK with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Allchin sat in the witness stand and watched silently as his
tape was played. On the tape, Allchin, who is a senior vice
president for Microsoft in charge of the Windows division,
navigated his way into a new computer he did not know and ran up
against the same software problems and glitches every computer user
encounters.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I've got to figure this out, and I don't have my glasses
with me,'' he said matter-of-factly when his screen suddenly went
blank. Later, when a Microsoft promotional program popped onto the
screen unbidden, complete with a loud gong from Big Ben followed by
upbeat jazz, Allchin looked a bit annoyed and said, ``Very nice
music, but not tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   As he tried to connect to the Internet while the camera watched,
the connections often failed, and when one did succeed, it seemed
to be agonizingly slow _ nothing like the zippy Internet downloads
shown in Microsoft's demonstration tape that was played in court on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The performance problem you see here has nothing to do with
Dr. Felton's program,'' Allchin acknowledged at one point.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who is hearing the case without a jury, watched the
tape silently, often with a bemused expression on his face.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Allchin demonstrated that, after running the
government program, he could to re-enable Internet Explorer through
a complex series of changes in the Windows registry file that no
normal user would be able to carry out without precise
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   Before doing that, he demonstrated that several programs did not
work properly on what he called ``a Felton-ized machine.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the problems he showed related to features of the
programs that interacted with the Internet. And when Boies got a
chance to question Allchin again, he immediately asked: Isn't it
logical to expect, after disabling the browser, ``that anything
that depended on the browser wouldn't work right?''
</P>
<P>
   Allchin conceded that fact. And as for the other problems and
glitches Allchin demonstrated, Boies said: ``What Dr. Felton
prepared was not a commercial product. It was a concept program.
Wouldn't you expect it to have problems? Doesn't Microsoft find
bugs in its programs during the normal course of software
development?'' To that last question, Allchin said yes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Before Allchin played his tape, another Microsoft witness,
Michael Devlin, an independent software developer, completed his
testimony in about 90 minutes. In his direct, written testimony, he
said his company appreciated Microsoft's decision to include a Web
browser with Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, the lead government attorney, barely referred to that
testimony in his brief, 27-minute cross-examination. Instead he
tried to throw Devlin's motivations for testifying into question by
demonstrating that his company was dependent on Microsoft for more
than half of its business and was at risk of serious financial
damage from Microsoft if the company were to decide to make a
competing product.
</P>
<P>
   Devlin acknowledged that, but Boies never asked him directly if
those concerns had played into his decision to agree to Microsoft's
request to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft also made public the written testimony of the next
witness, William Poole, senior director of business development for
Microsoft, who will take the stand on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In it, Poole defends the restrictive contracts Microsoft won
from other companies doing business on the Internet, requiring them
to promote Internet Explorer in exchange for advertising space in
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The government charges that these contracts are anticompetitive
and illegal, but Poole calls them ``routine cross-licensing
agreements, common across many industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Poole also argues that, in the end, the contracts did not
significantly impede the Netscape Communications Corp., the chief
competitor to Internet Explorer. And he adds, the ``channel bar,''
the space in Windows where the ads appeared, ``turned out to be a
commercial disappointment'' in any case.

NEW DATA AND FED HELP TREASURIES RESPOND TO A FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bond prices fell sharply early Thursday and then cut
their losses as investors tried to sort out several rumors, deal
with new data showing that the economy is still strong and confront
growing fears that the next move by the Federal Reserve will be to
raise interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   All these concerns mean that Friday's employment report could
have a significant effect on bond trading. If the job growth in
January turns out to have been a lot stronger than expected, more
investors will be convinced that interest rates, despite low
inflation, are headed higher. That would touch off further bond
selling and probably help send stocks lower. The Wall Street
consensus for January nonfarm job growth is 138,000, according to
Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are facing a situation where the Fed has threatened to
tighten if the economy does not slow down,'' said Louis Crandall,
chief economist at R.H. Wrightson &AMP; Associates.
</P>
<P>
   In late trading Thursday, the price of the benchmark 30-year
bond fell 17/32, to 99 15/32. The yield, which moves in the
opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.29 percent from 5.25
percent Wednesday. In the morning session, the bond was off as much
as 1 12/32, and the yield was up to 5.34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the rebound appeared to be the indication that
Federal Reserve policy-makers, who left interest rates unchanged
after their meeting on Wednesday, also did not alter their stance
on prospects for future rate moves.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts had been worried that the Fed's stance, which has
been neutral, was shifted to suggest that policy-makers thought
their next move on rates was likely to be an increase.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fed said it would announce any important change in the
stance right after policy meetings rather than waiting until the
release of that meeting's minutes, which are published about six
weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   One rumor that set off selling Thursday concerned Friday's
employment report. Traders said there was talk in the morning that
the Bureau of Labor Statistics had mistakenly printed January's
jobs data on its Internet site ahead of Friday's scheduled release
and that the report showed nonfarm payroll jobs jumped by 350,000
in January, well above forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the bureau said, ``There was no premature
release of the data today.'' In November, the October jobs data was
put out a day early on the bureau's Internet site. And last month,
the producer price index for December was released a day early.
</P>
<P>
   Another rumor was that Japanese investors were selling U.S.
Treasury securities, in part to make up for recent losses in the
Japanese bond market.
</P>
<P>
   A more concrete influence on the market was the economic data,
which were all strong and are forcing Wall Street economists to
revise their growth forecasts upward for the first half of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Factory orders jumped 2.3 percent in December, to $343.5
billion, a record. At the same time, retailers reported that sales
at chain stores open at least a year climbed 8.3 percent in
January, surpassing forecasts by as much as two percentage points.

CLINTON TELLS ARAFAT TO EASE ISRAELIS' CONCERNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Thursday warned Yasser Arafat
against declaring Palestinian statehood without an agreement on the
politically explosive issue with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met with Arafat at the Washington Hilton on Thursday
morning, after both had attended an annual ecumenical prayer
breakfast where Arafat's appearance had touched off a boycott by
some religious groups and members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In both his public remarks at the breakfast and privately in his
20-minute meeting with the Palestinian leader, Clinton thanked
Arafat for his efforts toward reconciliation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   But he prodded Arafat to do more to ease Israeli concerns about
the safety of Jewish residents of territories that come under
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reminded Arafat that ``final-status talks'' with Israel
are to begin on May 4 to deal with the most intractable issues,
including sovereignty for Palestinians, the future of Jerusalem,
border security and the allocation of scarce water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Any one-sided efforts by Arafat to address these questions _
particularly Palestinian statehood _ would be resisted by the
United States and certainly by Israel, Clinton said, according to
his aides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president reiterated the longstanding U.S. position that
unilateral steps are not helpful to the process and this issue is
an issue to be discussed in the context of the final status
talks,'' a senior official said.

RANGERS STILL HAVE ECONOMIC FLEXIBILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ This winter provided two significant events
regarding the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Doug Melvin could not pry right-hander Roger
Clemens from the Toronto Blue Jays, and the organization witnessed
a substantial increase in its payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the Rangers will retain the financial flexibility
to acquire Clemens or others who become available via trade this
season. This despite an Opening Day payroll that could climb to $75
million with the contractual result of arbitration-eligible
right-hander Aaron Sele.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always hope that we would have flexibility,'' Rangers
president Tom Schieffer said. ``I think we recognize that at some
point in time you have to do some fine-tuning on even the best of
ballclubs. We know that's the case, and we try to plan for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tom Hicks has proven that if you can go to him and
say, `This gives us a better chance to win,' then he will do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, the Rangers' owner, appeared willing to renegotiate
Clemens' existing contract during Melvin's dogged pursuit of the
five-time Cy Young Award recipient throughout November. The
Rangers, though, could not satisfy the Blue Jays' demands, and
discussions ceased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not much has happened. I think Clemens is going to stay with
Toronto,'' Schieffer said, ``and if they're in it, he'll stay there
all year. If they're not in it, my guess is they'll start talking
about it again near the trade deadline. That's not to say something
couldn't happen before then, but it doesn't have the feel of
something that's about to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, though, might not be the only front-line pitcher who
could become available this season. Oakland's Kenny Rogers,
Cincinnati's Denny Neagle, Philadelphia's Curt Schilling, Kansas
City's Kevin Appier and Minnesota's Brad Radke loom as potential
trade acquisitions near the July 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the Rangers' July 31 additions this past
season cannot be dismissed. Right-hander Todd Stottlemyre,
shortstop Royce Clayton and third baseman Todd Zeile helped the
Rangers secure their second American League West title in three
seasons, but their services did not come without a steep price.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers parted with left-hander Darren Oliver, third baseman
Fernando Tatis and three minor-league players and inherited more
than $2.6 million in additional player salaries for the season's
final two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we would have won if we had not made those moves
last year,'' Schieffer said. ``We felt that with those moves we
could win, and we did win. We also felt with those moves that we
could go further than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' postseason experience proved brief. The eventual
World Series champion New York Yankees dismissed the Rangers with a
three-game sweep in their best-of-five, AL Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought that the Yankees had a better team than we did on a
162-game basis, but we thought we might be able to sneak up on them
in a five-game series,'' Schieffer said. ``The fact of the matter
is we pitched well enough in that five-game series to sneak up on
them, but they pitched better. They were obviously a team of
destiny in 1998, but if you ask me: `Could we have won without
making those trades?' I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made the trades, and we won the division. It gave us the
opportunity to go further, but unfortunately it didn't work out.
It's not all bad, though, to continue to win around here. It was a
long time before we won the first time, and now we've won two of
the past three years. We would rather have a winning tradition
established than just a tradition of futility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Commissioner's Office computed the Rangers' 1998 payroll to
be the seventh-highest at $67,956,293. That includes $5,576,415 to
cover health and pension benefits, medical costs, insurance,
workmen's compensation, unemployment and Social Security taxes,
spring training allowances, meal money, All-Star Game expenses,
travel and moving expenses, postseason pay and college
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer expects that figure to climb to $81 million or $82
million this season, yet the Rangers will retain the financial
flexibility to inherit additional player salaries this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that we don't have to do that,'' Schieffer said. ``We
hope that everyone will be clicking along, and we'll be 10 or 15
games ahead and don't have to make any moves. It's not just the
money at that point and time. It's the prospects you have to give
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we would love to be able to do is go through a season and
not give up any prospects, but the first thing we want to do is
win. We're prepared to do what it takes to win.''

SENATE DENIES IMPEACHMENT MANAGERS LIVE LEWINSKY TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate, in a crucial blow to the beleaguered
House impeachment managers, Thursday rejected a last-ditch plea for
Monica S. Lewinsky to testify in President Clinton's trial, opting
instead to permit videotaped testimony by the former White House
intern in a nationally televised session Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing number of Republicans hungry for the trial to end
and wary of hearing live testimony on the Senate floor about
Clinton's sex scandal, 25 GOP senators joined the united Democratic
minority to block Lewinsky's appearance, in a surprisingly lopsided
vote, 70-30.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the Senate voted, 62-38, to grant the House
team's ``fall-back'' request: to show video clips of Lewinsky and
two other witnesses in a three-hour presentation Saturday of the
evidence against the president. The White House lawyers also will
have three hours for their presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The moves keep the Senate on track to complete the historic
trial by next Friday, Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a critical day, and guarantees now that we're moving to
the final phase of the impeachment trial,'' the Senate majority
leader, Trent Lott, said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, which has increasingly escalated its attacks on
Senate Republicans for voting last week to continue the trial, saw
hope in Thursday's action. ``Today's vote rejecting the House
managers' request for live witnesses indicates the Senate appears
ready to bring this trial to a conclusion,'' said White House
spokesman Joseph Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   The developments unfolded as Republicans, facing unanimous
Democratic opposition, also effectively dropped their bid for a
bipartisan plan to cite Clinton for wrongdoing during the trial
without convicting him.
</P>
<P>
   Rising in its place was an alternative proposal to censure
Clinton outside the impeachment proceedings, which also faces major
obstacles, despite marginal GOP support.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the scramble for an exit strategy, the House Republican
managers abruptly scaled back their quest for live testimony,
requesting only Lewinsky's appearance, and abandoning their plan to
seek additional subpoenas for Clinton's friend Vernon E. Jordan and
White House adviser Sidney Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   But even that tactic failed. The aversion to summoning Lewinsky
to the Senate floor was so powerful that only one New Englander
voted for the request: Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire
Republican, who is considering running for president.
</P>
<P>
   Only the most conservative GOP senators, including Lott, voted
to hear Lewinsky tell her account on the Senate floor of her role
in Clinton's alleged attempt to cover up his sexual affair with
her. Two articles of impeachment allege that Clinton committed
perjury and obstructed justice to conceal the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to bring this impeachment trial to an end,'' said
Senator James M. Jeffords, a Vermont Republican, who until Thursday
had voted for the House team to proceed with its case against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who has been questioned 23 times about Clinton's sex
scandal, issued a statement Thursday expressing relief at the
Senate's decision to spare her from a public interrogation in the
well of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica and her family are pleased she does not have to go
through the painful and humiliating ordeal of having to testify on
the floor of the Senate,'' said a spokeswoman for Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the vote to permit showing parts of the videotapes, Jeffords
joined Senator Olympia J. Snowe of Maine as the only Republicans to
oppose showing the images of Lewinsky, Jordan and Blumenthal in
their presentation Saturday. All three witnesses gave private,
videotaped depositions earlier this week, which the senators later
viewed privately.
</P>
<P>
   ``The depositions served their purpose,'' Snowe said. ``I don't
think we would have gained any new information by seeing edited
versions of them on the Senate floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine Democrats broke party ranks to support the House request to
show the videotapes, including one New Englander: Senator Joseph I.
Lieberman of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent motion by Senator Patty Murray, a Washington
Democrat, to permit written transcripts rather than videotapes in
the presentations was defeated, 73-27, with 20 Democrats joining
all but one Republican, Snowe, in opposing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman and Senator John F. Kerry were the only New England
Democrats to oppose Murray's motion.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers, who wanted to call as many 15 witnesses to
the Senate floor when the trial began, grudgingly endured the
latest in a series of restrictions on their case.
</P>
<P>
   Despite nearly unanimous agreement that Clinton will be
acquitted, members of the House team argued they deserved the right
to present their case at least partly on their terms. And the
strain showed several times as they were rebuffed yet again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one senator has failed to personally sit through'' the
videotaped deposition, Representative James F. Rogan of California
said during the trial, ``that senator is not equipped to render a
verdict on the impeachment trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, when White House lawyers asked for advance notice of the
video clips the House intends to play Saturday, Rogan quoted a
former California judge as saying, ``It's none of your damn
business what the other side is going to put on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican majority supported the House managers on that
point, 54-46, with only Jeffords breaking ranks in either party.
</P>
<P>
   But Rogan's remarks further bristled Democrats, who have
complained for days that Senate Republicans are prolonging the
trial only to satisfy their conservative base and save face for the
House managers.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry, who argued unsuccessfully for the White House to have
ample time to prepare to rebut the House presentation, denounced
Rogan's comment as ``arrogant and inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   For an hour Thursday, the House team argued that the depositions
had produced sigificant new evidence to require Lewinsky's live
testimony or the videotaped presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Citing portions of Lewinsky's deposition, Representative Asa
Hutchinson of Arkansas asserted that Lewinsky set up a meeting last
year with Jordan to try to ``cushion the shock'' of her friend
Linda R. Tripp possibly disclosing details of the president's
affair with Lewinsky. An excerpt from the deposition quoted
Lewinsky as saying she had never told Clinton that she had confided
in Tripp about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that was sort of my intention in meeting with Mr. Jordan,
was hoping that I could give a little information and that would
get passed on,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan, who had testified before a federal grand jury that he
never had that breakfast meeting with Lewinsky, conceded in his
Senate deposition that the meeting occurred. In addition, Jordan
acknowledged that he discussed notes that Lewinsky had written to
the president, but he did not corroborate Lewinsky's assertion that
he had told her, ``Go home and make sure they're not there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson asserted that Jordan acted as Clinton's ``agent'' in
illegally trying to coneal his affair with Lewinsky from lawyers in
a sexual harassment suit that Paula Corbin Jones filed against the
president and settled last year for $850,000. As part of the
alleged effort, Jordan helped find Lewinsky a job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The transcripts show that Jordan undertook the search on
Clinton's behalf at the behest of the president's personal
secretary, Betty Currie. ``There is no question but that through
Betty Currie I was acting on behalf of the president to get Ms.
Lewinsky a job,'' Jordan said in his Senate deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The House managers alleged that Jordan helped find Lewinsky the
job to encourage her to file a false affidavit in the Jones case.
When Jordan learned that Lewinsky completed the affidavit,
according to a transcript of his deposition, he told Clinton, ``Mr.
President, she signed the affidavit.''
</P>
<P>
   Complete transcripts of the three depositions are to be made
public Friday as part of the Congressional Record. Copies of the
videotapes are not expected to be released until after the trial.
</P>
<P>
   But special White House counsel Gregory B. Craig argued before
the Senate that the depositions yielded ``no bombshells'' or
``dynamite'' that warranted Lewinsky's video clips to be shown.
</P>
<P>
   Forshadowing Saturday's session, Craig warned that permitting
the House managers to show their ``greatest hits'' from the
videotapes could prompt the White House to respond in kind. ``This
would be a duel of snippets,'' Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current format, the trial will not be in session
Friday, as the House managers and Clinton's lawyers prepare for the
presentations Saturday and their closing arguments on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   With the trial winding down, both sides struggled to bridge the
partisan gulf to find an agreement on a sanction of Clinton short
of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy lashed out at the Republican ``finding
of fact'' plan, which would cite Clinton for wrongdoing during the
trial. ``It would turn the Senate into a kangaroo court,'' Kennedy
said. ``I don't think Senator Lott wants to go down in history as
the chief kangaroo.''
</P>
<P>
   Snowe, a key sponsor of the ``finding of fact'' plan, said the
proposal is dead without Democratic backing. She said she remained
open to a possible censure after the trial, but she harshly
criticized a proposal that several Demcorats floated Thursday to
temporarily suspend the trial next week to impose the censure.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sounds like a real political concoction if I ever heard
one,'' Snowe said. ``That is really trying to jury-rig the
Constitution during an impeachment trial to achieve what they want
as a political goal.''

 &HT;    Hawks aim high with eager veteran lineup ready for opener vs.

<P>
   ATLANTA _ No, these are not the same old Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Given scant preparation time, they are better trained and better
prepared than they have any right to be.
</P>
<P>
   They are feisty and confident, maybe a little cocky, because
they figure they have a little secret. And that is how good they
can be.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that says it wants to win and acts like it
intends to win _ with the caveat that it hasn't been tested. But
that is why they play the games, the first of which is tonight at
the Georgia Dome against the Cleveland Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   When the lockout ended last month, the Hawks were in a
rebuilding mode, prepared to ride out a rough season while looking
ahead to next year's free-agent market and the move into a new
arena. But a series of signings altered their thinking. So, while
construction continues on their future home, the Hawks will go to
work in the Dome and Alexander Memorial Coliseum with lofty
immediate goals.
</P>
<P>
   With an abbreviated road to travel _ 50 games in place of 82,
because the lockout shortened the season _ the Hawks have given the
public some information to go on.
</P>
<P>
   The returning veterans on the team _ Dikembe Mutombo, Steve
Smith, Mookie Blaylock and Tyrone Corbin _ last spring challenged
their coach to make them work harder, to set the standards higher
for practice, to set down tough rules of conduct.
</P>
<P>
   That was their commitment coming out of last season's bitter
disappointment, a first-round playoff loss. They held up their end
throughout the lockout by training hard, playing together in a
loose approximation of the unified drills that have brought such
acclaim to the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   The club brought back the same five players who finished the
season but will not put the same starters on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Corbin, 35, has been replaced by LaPhonso Ellis, signed Saturday
after Denver renounced him.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis is easily the highest-rated small forward the Hawks have
had since Danny Manning raced Dominique Wilkins out of town in
1994. Corbin isn't even the backup, at this point. The Hawks are
going with rookie Roshown McLeod, although a strained left
hamstring might hold him back the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   In itself, that move signifies an upgrade for the bench, but
there is more. Anthony Johnson, a second-year player out of College
of Charleston, moves behind Blaylock at the point. At 6 feet 3 with
a natural point guard's instincts, Johnson was good enough to start
62 games at Sacramento last season.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gray, who appeared in only 30 games before re-fracturing his
right foot, has shown startling offensive skills and has displayed
a more businesslike attitude in his second season. His talent is
such that the Hawks did not go after Dell Curry, a dangerous
scorer, when Charlotte elected not to re-sign him.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle, the Hawks acquired Mark West, a 15-year veteran,
to play behind Mutombo. As recently as two years ago, West logged
about 13 minutes a game in Cleveland. That's about what the Hawks
are asking.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in a move critical to team moral, the Hawks brought
back another veteran, Grant Long, who plays behind starting power
forward Alan Henderson. Smart, tough and well-conditioned, Long is
that rare performer who talks and plays the same game.
</P>
<P>
   The14-member roster _ which shrinks to 12 on Feb. 19 _ is
rounded out with forward Chris Crawford and rookie guards Shammond
Williams and Jeff Sheppard. Center Scot Pollard, acquired with a
draft pick from Detroit for Christian Laettner, was placed on the
injured list Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Is coach Lenny Wilkens happy? Oh, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a terrific camp,'' he said Thursday. ``We really got
after it. The players were hard on each other, so much so that I
wanted to make our final practice easier, because I didn't want to
take the risk of getting anybody hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, other than McLeod's accident _ he stepped on a
teammate's foot _ and Pollard's severe bout of flu, the Hawks came
through eight days of double sessions without incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than having so many guys join us late, everything was
exactly what I wanted,'' Wilkens said, a reference to days lost
before Henderson and Corbin signed contracts and free agents Ellis
and Long, who had been a Hawk for two years before, made their
decisions. The former got in five days' work, the latter four.
``And when they came in, they were all business,'' Wilkens said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant has the benefit of knowing the system, but I'm relying
on the goodwill of my teammates,'' Ellis said. ``When I get lost,
they help me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis might have trouble learning some of the terminology, but
he was Mutombo's teammate in Denver for four years, and that gives
him a leg up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may take LaPhonso and (me) a couple games to get into the
swing of it,'' Long said. ``I know the plays, but I still have to
think a second. But that will pass. We'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens said, ``They'll be fine. I'm not worried about them. I'm
so delighted with what they bring to our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only is this by far the deepest team Wilkens has had since
coming to Atlanta in 1993, Smith, the team's leading scorer at 20.1
points a game, thinks it also will prove to be the toughest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got some solid pros on this team, guys who play with
their hearts and their head,'' Smith said. ``I'm committed to
stepping up. I'll set a tone. So is Mookie. Alan is an emotional
younger guy, and Grant is an emotional older guy. Ty and Mark are
smart veterans. Dikembe's got a lot of pride. Our rookies are
smart, and they have good leaders to follow.''

</P>
<P>
   _ TV; radio: WATL; WSB-750 AM.
</P>
<P>
   _ Series history: The Hawks have dominated while the Cavaliers
rebuilt with young players, sweeping four games last season. Over
the past three seasons, the Hawks are 10-2 against Cleveland,
although four of the last seven victories have been by five points
or fewer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tickets: Advance sale of 14,400; all tickets up to $35 are $10
tonight and Saturday against the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cleveland update: The Cavs made only one important roster
change, re-signing small forward Johnny Newman, who last played for
them as a rookie in 1987. On the downside is power forward Shawn
Kemp's publicized weight problem, although he has slimmed down from
his reporting weight of 303. Guard Bob Sura is slowed by a
right-ankle problem after surgery.
</P>
<P>
   _ The starters: Atlanta _ PF Alan Henderson (6-9), SF LaPhonso
Ellis (6-8), C Dikembe Mutombo (7-2), SG Steve Smith (6-8), PG
Mookie Blaylock (6-1); Cleveland _ PF Shawn Kemp (6-10), SF Cedric
Henderson (6-7); C Zydrunas Ilgauskas (7-3); SG Wesley Person
(6-6), PG Brevin Knight (5-10).
</P>
<P>
   _ Injuries: Atlanta _ center Scot Pollard (flu) is on the
five-game injured list; Cleveland _ forward Ryan Stack (rehab,
broken right hand) is on the injured list.

 &HT;    Who's who in NBA's Class of '99
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   MOST LIKELY TO SUCCEED
</P>
<P>
   _ EAST: Indiana. Last year, in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference
finals, the Pacers were five points short of upsetting the Bulls.
They return the entire team, plus wily veteran forward Sam Perkins.
It seems only an injury to Reggie Miller could derail the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   _ WEST: Los Angeles Lakers. Shaquille O'Neal is determined to
take this talented bunch to the summit, and with the development of
Kobe Bryant and the influence of newly acquired Derek Harper, don't
bet against him in the truly wild West.
</P>
<P>
   MOST DRAMATIC CHANGES
</P>
<P>
   _ EAST: New York. With the addition of explosive personalities
in Latrell Sprewell and Dennis Scott, the Knicks changed the fabric
of their team. They no longer are tough and grinding, now that
Charles Oakley and John Starks have departed.
</P>
<P>
   _ WEST: Sacramento. The Kings, perpetual doormats, gave up
All-Star guard Mitch Richmond, but they acquired big men Chris
Webber and Vlade Divac to go with rookie guard Jason Williams and
rising star Corliss Williamson. They're no longer the team you want
to face to end a losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   LEAST IMPROVED
</P>
<P>
   _ EAST: Washington. Mitch Richmond and Rod Strickland form a
star backcourt, but the Wizards have no center, no small forward
and a bench made up of nobodies. They're doomed for their usual
finish place of .500 or lower.
</P>
<P>
   _ WEST: Minnesota. Stephon Marbury likely will be a better floor
leader, but the loss of Tom Gugliotta is significant. Former No. 1
pick Joe Smith signed as a free agent, but his game is suspect.
Once thought to be a team on the rise, the Timberwolves are frozen
in neutral.
</P>
<P>
   MOST LIKELY TO SURPRISE
</P>
<P>
   _ EAST: Cleveland. The Cavaliers added only forward Johnny
Newman to their young, talented core, and that's all they needed.
With Mike Fratello in charge, they'll contend.
</P>
<P>
   _ WEST: Portland. The Trail Blazers have a quality starting
five, and the addition of defensive point guard Greg Anthony and
scorer Jimmy Jackson make them even deeper and more dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   CLASS CLOWNS
</P>
<P>
   _ EAST: Chicago. Oh, how the mighty has fallen. Bring a roster
with you to the game to identify the Bulls. It's not even right to
call them the ``defending champions.'' How are they going to have a
championship-ring ceremony with the core spread around the league?
</P>
<P>
   _ WEST: Clippers. Well, they are the Clippers.

<P>
   _ Outlook: A deep team that can compete for the Eastern title if

</P>
<P>
   3. CLEVELAND
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 47-35, eliminated in first playoff round.
</P>

tearing an Achilles'. Vaught has a bad back, and Dele (formerly
Brian Williams) is too heavy.
</P>
<P>
   5. MILWAUKEE

veteran squad, but that still may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   8. CHICAGO
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 62-20, won NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Tim Floyd (first year).
</P>

(traded to Rockets), C Luc Longley (traded to Suns), G Steve Kerr

</P>
<P>
   ATLANTIC DIVISION
</P>
<P>
   1. MIAMI
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 55-27, eliminated in second playoff round.
</P>
<P>
   _ Coach: Pat Riley (913-387).
</P>
<P>
   _ They're back: G Tim Hardaway, G Dan Majerle, F P.J. Brown,
FJamal Mashburn, F Mark Strickland, F Keith Askins, C Alonzo
Mourning.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   _ Say goodbye to: G Brent Barry (signed with Bulls), G Eric
Murdock (signed with Nets), G Voshon Lenard (leg stress fracture,
out for 10 weeks).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: The Heat wants to think Porter and Weatherspoon will
matter, but Lenard can't play until the final two weeks. The Heat
is cooling.
</P>
<P>
   2. NEW JERSEY
</P>
<P>
   _ Last season: 43-39, eliminated in first playoff round.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Post-Jordan title hopes widespread
 &HT;    By Curtis Bunn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The NBA will get a new champion this year; that much
is certain. But who will it be? And how?
</P>
<P>
   The other teams had to feel ambivalent last month when Michael
Jordan retired and the Chicago Bulls' management subsequently
dismantled the three-time titlists so that it probably will be
years before they are competitive again. Surely, the clubs that
Jordan has whipped over the years hated to see him go. Any true
competitor would like the chance to pay back his nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   However, winning a championship is so difficult and so rewarding
that the other pervasive feeling when Jordan bid adieu had to be _
hallelujah. With him gone, the title chase became a free-for-all,
attainable by almost any contender.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of free-agent signings and trades was frenetic, after a
labor lockout that delayed the start of the season three months. At
one point, movement backed up because the league office couldn't
handle the overflow of business.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the deals were done with the idea of winning it
all now. ``There are at least a half-dozen teams poised to make a
real good run at it now that Chicago is out of it,'' Miami Heat
coach Pat Riley said. ``Michael Jordan and his cast no longer loom
over the confidence of other teams. Teams have to be excited
knowing they are not suffering _ and painfully so _ at the hands of
Michael Jordan. I don't see one dominant team that can take your
confidence away in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   And so, optimism reigns around the league. The season, usually
82 games per team, begins its shortened version of 50 tonight. With
it, clubs have placed an urgency on finding a rhythm quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The teams that have been together the longest should have a
distinct advantage,'' Sacramento Kings coach Rick Adelman said.
``People think that the offense will be a big factor because of
that. But I think the teams that'll be much further along are going
to be the teams that get off to a good start at stopping people.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which won two championships in the years Jordan did not
play an entire season during his first ``retirement,'' has risen
from a club on the border to the upper echelon, with the
acquisition of Jordan's brilliant sidekick, Scottie Pippen. After
coach Phil Jackson and Jordan retired, Chicago signed Pippen and
dealt him to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``With (Hakeem) Olajuwon, Charles (Barkley) and Pippen, Houston
has three of the top 50 players in NBA history,'' Los Angeles
Lakers coach Del Harris said. ``With those three, you have to
consider them the wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   Many other wild cards are out there, too. In the Eastern
Conference, the Indiana Pacers took the Bulls to seven games in the
conference finals last year. Added to their veteran nucleus of
Reggie Miller, Mark Jackson and Rik Smits was Sam Perkins, the
lanky big man who can defend the low post and hit the 3-point shot.
Perkins played in the NBA Finals with the Los Angeles Lakers and
the Seattle SuperSonics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pacers should be brimming with confidence,'' Washington
Wizards coach Bernie Bickerstaff said.
</P>
<P>
   The feeling in New York is that the Knicks will be confident,
too _ in time. The Knicks, who vowed never to acquire players with
questionable character, went out and traded for the notorious
coach-choker, Latrell Sprewell. With the addition of Sprewell and
Marcus Camby, New York got younger and more athletic. But in giving
away Charles Oakley and John Starks, the Knicks lost their heart
and soul.
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference, back-to-back runner-up Utah welcomes
back old hands Karl Malone, John Stockton and Jeff Hornacek, but
key backup big man Antoine Carr bolted for Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After the expected period of shoddy play, it should be an
exciting race, Harris said, because ``the West is loaded.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio Spurs have their big, talented front line of
David Robinson and Tim Duncan. The Lakers added stabilizing force
Derek Harper to their ultra-talented mix. Phoenix, which lost
Antonio McDyess to Denver, made out by signing free agent Tom
Gugliotta, a better all-around player.
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal considers this his and the Lakers' year. ``No
more excuses,'' the game's dominant big man said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Bulls' certain demise, any predictions are risky.
Teams played only two exhibition games apiece, six fewer than
usual. Some All-Atars, including Cleveland's Shawn Kemp and Miami's
Tim Hardaway, came into camp after the lockout grossly out of
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches wrestled with how strenuously to work their teams. In
Washington, Bickerstaff went so far as to hold practices three
times a day. It's an unprecedented move, but one Bickerstaff deemed
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is of the essence,'' he said. ``From a conditioning
standpoint, I wanted to push them. You can't put five weeks of
regular camp into two. But you can do your best.''
</P>
<P>
   Many coaches say they'll use the first month of the season
monitoring minutes played more than diagramming X's and O's.
``Definitely,'' Golden State coach P.J. Carlesimo said, ``I'll
coach differently early. You have to play guys in spurts more so
than extended minutes. Until they get into the kind of game shape
they would be coming out of a normal training camp, you have to
make sure you don't keep a guy out there too long.''
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of injuries hung over the brief camps. Miami's
Voshon Lenard, New Jersey's Kerry Kittles and Charlotte's Glen Rice
and Anthony Mason are among those out for extended periods _ Mason
for the season. But it could have been worse.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that several teams have gone through a major
revamping of rosters, meaning the shortened preseason made it even
more difficult to mesh new players with old ones. All in all, it
was '``an interesting experience,''' Nets coach John Calipari said.
</P>
<P>
   How interested will fans be in the games? The NBA has mandated
lower ticket prices around the league in an effort to extend itself
to its followers. But the early indications were that it'll take at
least half and maybe all of the season to rekindle interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about the product,'' Milwaukee guard Ray Allen said. ``We
know they're upset with the product, but if we put a quality
product out there, the real basketball fans will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   One effect of smaller crowdscould be that the home-court
advantage is lessened because of fan apathy resulting from
post-lockout bitterness. In Miami, the Heat filled only half of its
arena for a preseason game against intrastate rival Orlando. And
the tickets were free.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't give tickets away, I don't know what we can do,''
Heat center Alonzo Mourning said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the playoffs roll around, the hope is that spectator
passion will have returned. By then, a number of teams could
challenge for a title that might have been unavailable if Jordan
had not left the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a reality,'' Detroit's Joe Dumars said. ``It's wide
open for everyone. It's a shortened season, no dynasty _ every
reason in the world for teams to feel like they can get that ring.
So, while it wasn't good for the game that Michael retired, it was
great for a lot of teams.

EMBASSY SECURITY BUDGET IS FAR LESS THAN PANEL URGED 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration budget to upgrade
embassy security around the world is far less than the
recommendation that an independent review panel made last month.
</P>
<P>
   But State Department officials said a new White House working
group was reviewing whether to increase the budget request to build
more embassies and comply more closely with the findings of the
review board. The panel was established after the bombings of two
U.S. Embassies in East Africa in August.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has asked Congress for $300 million to
improve security and construct embassies in the new budget year.
The department has asked for another $300 million the next year,
the last budget that the Clinton administration will submit.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures fall well short of the $1.4 billion a year in new
security spending recommended last month by the independent
accountability review board. The panel, led by a retired admiral,
William J. Crowe Jr., investigated the two embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told a Senate
Appropriations subcommittee on Thursday that budget constraints had
limited her department's ability to match the panel
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials later said that the budget request to
Congress had been drawn up before the independent panel's
recommendations and that State Department officials had joined the
White House group that is looking for ways to increase the budget
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal was criticized on Thursday by Sen.
Judd Gregg, R-N.H., and chairman of the Appropriations
subcommittee. Gregg noted that the State Department would quickly
fall billions of dollars behind the Crowe panel's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point your ability to rebuild and your ability to fix
up these embassies is going to outstrip the money that's been put
in the budget for you,'' Gregg told Albright. ``Those numbers are
not going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials acknowledged that the budget figures
did not come close to the recommendations, but said they believed
that they represented a ``good start'' on new construction. The
administration plans to spend $36 million next year to build new
embassies, to buy sites and to and design up to seven new
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The department will ask for an additional $268 million to
continue to pay for new security measures included in a $1.4
billion emergency supplemental budget that Congress approved last
year. That comes on top of the $350 million that the department
usually budgets for diplomatic security, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   To stay under limits imposed by budget laws, the administration
has proposed to spend $300 million in 2001 and $450 million in
2002. The administration has asked for a total of $3 billion over
five years beginning in 2001 to build 50 to 60 embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The money would not reach its peak of $900 million until 2005.
The five-year spending plan that begins with the fiscal year 2000
would spend $2.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants Congress to lock in future spending in
this year's budget. ``Our fear is that people will lose the urgency
that they now have in the wake of the embassy bombings, and so we
want to lock it in now,'' said a spokesman for the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   (STRY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Although congressional officials said they favored added
spending on embassy security, Congress rarely makes such long-term
budget commitments.
</P>
<P>
   The budget problems are eerily reminiscent of those that
confronted the State Department in the mid-1980s, when another
independent panel investigated another embassy bombing and
recommended another ambitious spending program.
</P>
<P>
   After the bombing of the Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983, a
panel headed by another retired admiral, Bobby Inman, urged the
building of dozens of new and more secure embassies. The board
criticized the State Department for not taking security seriously
enough and recommended that the government rebuild most of its
foreign posts.
</P>
<P>
   But after initially embracing the findings and building a few
embassies, the State Department and Congress gradually abandoned
efforts to put into effect the recommendations at most embassies.
</P>
<P>
   Although Albright has said she takes the Crowe panel findings
seriously, administration and congressional officials made it clear
Thursday that they were not very likely to match its ambitious
spending levels.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg is not now willing to give the State Department an
exemption from the budget caps, an aide said. He wants the
department to find money from other parts of its budget, and that
would make the task far more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a priority you can find money to fund it,'' the aide
said. ``Then you find out what is truly important.''

Willis (traded to Raptors).
</P>
<P>

Porter (signed with Heat), C Cherokee Parks (signed with
Grizzlies), G Micheal Williams (traded to Raptors).
</P>
<P>
   _ Outlook: Wolves management committed the classic gaffe of
allowing a superior player (Gugliotta) to walk away with nothing to
show for it. They take a small step backward.
</P>
<P>
   5. DENVER
</P>

   _ Outlook: McDyess and Van Exel bring credibility. If Williams
comes all the way back from a serious knee injury, the Nuggets can
improve dramatically, but no playoff now.
</P>
<P>
   6. DALLAS
</P>
<P>
   _ Last year: 20-62, missed playoffs.
</P>

This will take longer, but keeping Abdur-Rahim for seven years is a
good step forward.

 &HT;    Ford teams mounting challenge to Gordon
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The race to catch Jeff Gordon and his
Chevrolet begins Saturday when the 1999 NASCAR Winston Cup season
officially begins with qualifying for the Feb. 14 Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   While Gordon, who will be shooting for his third points
championship in a row, is obviously the driver in front, veteran
Rusty Wallace and some of the other Ford teams posted some of the
fastest speeds at Daytona testing last month.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fords accounted for eight of the top 15 laps in
testing. Wallace, 42, registered the top lap at 193.129 mph, which
would have been good enough to win the pole in last year's Daytona
500.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was second in testing at 192.452, and Kyle Petty was
third at 192.341 in the No. 44 Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte won last year's pole for the race at 192.415.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw those numbers (last month) we were pretty
shocked,'' Gordon said. ``When you get down (there) and put
NASCAR's restrictor plate on and go through inspection, things
change a little bit. If they can put those numbers out there then,
they can have the pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying for the 500 field begins at 12:30 p.m. Saturday. The
first round determines only the two drivers on the front row, the
pole and outside pole. The other drivers can stand on their speeds
from Saturday's round or run in second- or third-round qualifying
on Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The laps from Monday and Tuesday are used to determine
positioning for Thursday's 125-mile qualifying races. The 125s will
determine the Nos. 3-30 spots in the race lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The final 13 drivers in the 500 field will come from those with
the six best speeds who hadn't qualified for the race, and
provisional starters based on last year's car-owner standings
points.
</P>
<P>
   DAYTONA 500 QUALIFYING
</P>
<P>
   _ What: Positions 1 and 2
</P>
<P>
   _ When: 12:30 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Daytona International Speedway, Daytona Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   _ Additional qualifying: Monday and Tuesday to set positions for
Thursday's 125-mile races, which determine positions 3-30 in the
500 on Feb. 14.

TECH SHARES DOWN SHARPLY THURSDAY; NASDAQ FELL 3.3 PERCENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Please note that the word STAR in parentheses has been used
in the second graf instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to some newspaper systems.)

 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Computer-related shares fell sharply Thursday,
dragging the NASDAQ composite index down 3.3 percent, its biggest
loss in more than five months, as Merrill Lynch cut its estimate on
Intel's profits for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The skid in high-technology stocks reverberated elsewhere, but
less severely, in a session also marked by frantic activity in the
stocks of online brokerage houses amid temporary shutdowns for a
second day in the processing system at E(STAR)Trade, the No. 3
Internet broker.
</P>
<P>
   The NASDAQ composite fell 83.34 points, its third-biggest point
drop ever, to 2,410.07. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell
23.58, or 1.85 percent, to 1,248.49. The Dow Jones industrial
average held up relatively better and even nosed briefly into
positive ground in the afternoon before slipping 62.31, nearly 0.7
percent, to 9,304.50.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of the wild swings in technology shares was Siebert
Financial, a minor player in the online brokerage industry, which
soared as high as 70| from Wednesday's close of 49{ and then dived
after the attorney general of New York said he was investigating
the ability of online brokers to process large numbers of trades.
The stock ended with a loss of 6\, at 43\.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors weighed on the market as well. Saying stocks had
simply become too expensive, Douglas R. Cliggott, the top U.S.
equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Securities, recommended lowering
holdings in stocks to 50 percent from 60 percent, putting 25
percent in cash and keeping bonds at 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on current 30-year Treasury yields and our guess at
first-quarter corporate earnings, the S&AMP;P 500 is now 16 percent
rich relative to our fair value measure,'' Cliggott said.
</P>
<P>
   To justify today's prices, he added, profits would have to rise
12 percent this year and bond yields would need to drift back
toward 5 percent. He said such an outcome was not very likely.
</P>
<P>
   Considerable money was also shifting Thursday from technology
and other highflying issues into economically sensitive areas like
the paper industry. Union Camp rose 3 7/16, to 67|; Georgia-Pacific
was up 3 3/16, to 69 15/16, and International Paper, the
second-best performer among the Dow industrials, climbed 2|, to 44
3/16. The best performer was another such stock, Alcoa, which
jumped 3|, to 86 11/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see profit taking in the recently strong tech stocks, and
some money flowing into cyclicals,'' said Robert H. Stovall,
president of Stovall/21st Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was the biggest drag on the S&AMP;P 500, falling 7}, to
159 1/16. Intel was right behind, falling 8 9/16, to 130[; followed
by Lucent Technologies, down 7[, to 102~; Cisco Systems, off 5~, to
105\; General Electric, down 2}, to 100[, and Dell Computer, off
5{, to 102].
</P>
<P>
   Internet shares other than brokers were also pummeled, with Ebay
slumping 39\, to 239; Yahoo falling 21 1/16, to 337, and Amazon.com
declining 7}, to 118. ``It was a pretty bleak day,'' said Neil T.
Eigen, a managing director at J&AMP;W Seligman. ``A lot of these
Internet stocks have paused.''
</P>
<P>
   Advanced Micro Devices, Intel's biggest rival in chips,
announced that it might report an operating loss for the first
quarter after having been expected by Wall Street to earn 13 cents
a diluted share. Trading was halted, and the stock fell 2 1/16, to
18~.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drag on the Dow, accounting for almost 40 percent of
its decline, was IBM, which fell 5 11/16, to 169 9/16. AT&AMP;T lost 3
9/16, to 91 7/16, and J.P. Morgan fell 3], to 100~. Morgan was one
of several weak bank issues.

NEW PAPERS FILED IN SUIT OVER DEATH OF CELTICS STAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Legal papers filed Thursday in Suffolk Superior Court
present strikingly contrasting views of the medical treatment given
by Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. to Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis in
the months before Lewis's fatal heart attack in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also shed new light on the question of whether
Lewis used cocaine during his lifetime and if the damage to his
heart was cocaine-related.
</P>
<P>
   The papers, filed in connection with the malpractice suit
brought against Mudge by Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, focus
in part on whether the cardiologist overlooked prior test results
and medical opinions that indicated that Lewis had a
life-threatening heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for Harris-Lewis alleged that Mudge failed to
disseminate among his medical team at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital the findings of tests done on Lewis at New England Baptist
Hospital days before.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge defended the medical treatment he provided Lewis. Also, he
alleged that both Reggie and Donna Harris-Lewis had repeatedly
denied to him as well as the doctors at the Baptist who examined
him that he had used cocaine. Donna Harris-Lewis in fact became
agitated when Mudge first asked Reggie Lewis whether he had used
cocaine in the past, stating, according to Mudge:
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs, drugs, that is all they ask about. Just because he is
not (Larry) Bird. Don't insult my husband, he is a professional
world-class athlete. . . . They would never ask Larry about drugs.
. . . Drugs, drugs, drugs. Why can't they think of anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   But in a written response to the plaintiff's questions filed
Thursday, Mudge said that two weeks before his death Lewis had told
him in a private conversation that he had used cocaine but had
stopped. In addition, Mudge alleges that six weeks after Lewis's
death, his widow told him over the phone that ``Reggie's mother was
a cocaine addict and Reggie had died of the poisons his mother gave
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, lawyers for Mrs. Harris-Lewis denied that Lewis had
used cocaine or other drugs and even if he had, it did not relieve
Mudge of the responsibility of properly diagnosing that his heart
was severely scarred and providing him adequate medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie Lewis came to Dr. Mudge with a serious medical
(condition). Dr. Mudge refused to recognize this condition despite
ample evidence and warnings of many prominent physicians. As a
result, this 27-year-old husband and father of two infants was put
in peril and allowed to die,'' according to a motion written by the
lawyers for Harris-Lewis, Robert G. Harley and Bridget Asaro of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The malpractice case is scheduled to go to trial in May or June
and with no settlement in sight the documents filed Thursday
reflect each side's strategy. While a state medical tribunal found
sufficient evidence for Harris-Lewis's case to proceed to trial in
1997, other malpractice lawyers say she faces a difficult hurdle of
proving not that Mudge's diagnosis was wrong, but that the Celtics
star could have survived even with the best medical advice.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harris-Lewis are seeking to show that Mudge made a
``determined effort'' to discount the unanimous opinion of the team
of other cardiologists, who consulted on Lewis's condition at the
Baptist, that his heart was seriously damaged. Without citing any
motivation for Mudge's actions, the lawyers for Harris-Lewis allege
that Mudge misread or purposefully minimized the results of an
echocardiogram done at the Baptist Hospital that showed that the
left ventricle of Lewis's heart was seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for Mudge, meanwhile, are focusing on the allegation
that Lewis used cocaine and that his hiding that fact from his
doctors impeded Mudge from making a proper diagnosis. In addition,
they contend that Mudge had given the Lewises privately a far more
sober assessment of the condition of Lewis's heart than Mudge was
saying publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, captain of the Celtics and their leading scorer,
collapsed during a playoff game against the Charlotte Hornets at
the Boston Garden on April 29, 1993. Disenchanted with the
treatment he was receiving at New England Baptist during the next
few days, Lewis transferred to the Brigham and Women's Hospital
where he remained under the care of Mudge and his medical team for
nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, 1993, Lewis suffered a fatal heart attack while
shooting baskets at Brandeis University in Waltham. His sudden
death cast a pall over the region, saddening far more than Celtics
fans. Lewis had become popular throughout the city for his
community work, and his death shocked a community that prides
itself on the superior medical care of its hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents filed by his lawyers, Mudge was
unaware that Lewis had resumed playing basketball before he
suffered his fatal attack. Mudge believed that Lewis was
restricting his exercise to stretching and light aerobics, but
nothing that would break a sweat. Two weeks before, on July 12,
Mudge received results of recently completed cardiac tests that had
been done on Lewis in Los Angeles as part of a third medical
opinion on his condition.
</P>
<P>
   The test showed that Lewis's heart condition had deteriorated
seriously and Mudge agreed with the assessment of one of the
cardiologists, Dr. J. Michael Criley of Los Angeles, that Lewis
should not play basketball at all. ``We (Mudge and Lewis) discussed
the reports and the fact that there was no explanation for the
change in Mr. Lewis's condition which we were seeing. I queried,
`Reggie, have you ever taken cocaine?' '' Mudge said in his written
responses to interrogatories given by the lawyers for Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked again have you ever taken cocaine and Mr. Lewis
indicated he had. I responded, `You have got to stop. Cocaine
causes all this, and at that point there was silence,' '' Mudge
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the papers filed by her lawyers, Harris-Lewis criticized
Mudge for not realizing at the outset of his examination of Lewis
that his heart was seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive tests on Lewis at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
Mudge announced at a widely reported press conference on May 10,
1993, that the reason for the Celtics star's collapse during the
playoff game was not any serious heart defect.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said Lewis's collapse had been caused by a
neurological condition that resulted in his heartbeat slowing down
on exertion instead of increasing. Lewis's condition could be
treated with medication and he could be expected to return as a
professional basketball player, Mudge said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mudge's conclusion was based on apparently flawed
decision-making, a willful attempt to play down the results of the
tests and medical conclusions reached about Lewis's condition by
the 12 cardiologists who examined him at the Baptist, lawyers for
Harris-Lewis stated.
</P>
<P>
   Asaro's motion charged that Mudge failed to share with the
doctors and medical staff who were conducting tests on Lewis at
Brigham and Women's the results of the tests done previously at the
New England Baptist Hospital that gave strong evidence that Lewis's
heart had structural damage.

STUDIO AGREES TO PAY SOME SCREENWRITERS A PERCENTAGE OF A MOVIE'S
PROFITS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ For years, the real source of wealth in the movie
business has not been the fees paid to stars, but a portion of the
profits on big films that an elite list of actors, directors and
producers has been able to command. It is a privilege that has
generally been denied one prominent player, the screenwriter.
</P>
<P>
   But a group of top writers broke through that barrier on
Thursday by announcing that Columbia Pictures has agreed to share a
portion of the profits of successful movies with them in addition
to paying their usual fees.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a combination of symbol and substance, because some
of the terms are vague, but it is likely to place heavy pressure on
other studios to match the terms and shift slightly the balance of
power in the movie business toward writers.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's announcement addresses what has been a growing source
of bitterness for the screenwriters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about dignity as much as anything else,'' said
Nicholas Kazan, one of the negotiators and the screenwriter of
``Reversal of Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   What was perhaps most striking was that the agreement was
negotiated by a small group of highly successful writers, including
the screenwriters of films like ``Field of Dreams,'' ``Dead Poets
Society'' and ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' but it covers any
writer who meets certain fixed criteria, like getting a script
nominated for an Oscar or getting a million dollar fee for a
script. The criteria would cover hundreds of writers in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators had been discussing the idea at regular Thursday
evening dinners for months, but once they got serious, they said,
they insisted that the terms apply equally to other writers and not
just to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement represented a public relations coup for
Columbia Pictures, a unit of Sony Corp. Columbia Pictures, which
saw its market share slide considerably last year, is eager to
establish in the intensely competitive and image-obsessed movie
business a reputation as a sympathetic home for talented writers,
and it is now offering something the others are not.
</P>
<P>
   In television, the writer is king, but in the world of film, the
director is considered the primary shaper of the product. There are
a growing number of films released every year, and their costs have
been rising sharply. This deal represents an effort to shift
slightly the balance of power in the business in an effort to
create a product that stands out from the clutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was going to happen at some point,'' said Amy
Pascal, the president of Columbia Pictures. ``If not us, they would
have gone somewhere else.'' She added that the deal was structured
so that it brought to her studio a broad range of new writers who
had not worked there previously and had little downside since it
pays the writers more only on profitable films.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't get anything more if we don't make money too,''
said Ms. Pascal. ``This is a win-win for everybody. That's pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, top Hollywood figures like Harrison Ford and Tom
Cruise and directors like Steven Spielberg and James Cameron have
been able to get a share of the profit of their movies. There is no
standard agreement, however, and the studios are notorious for
engaging in accounting practices that transform major box office
successes into what, on paper anyway, look like commercial losers.
But on some major box office successes those ``points,'' as they
are known, can amount to many millions of dollars if the contracts
are negotiated well.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been something the studios have been extremely
reluctant to give anyone,'' said Daniel Petrie Jr., a successful
writer who is the president of the Writer's Guild West, which was
not a party to the agreement. ``The studios had been able to
artificially hold the line against writers getting this, and it has
been of great concern to us. In the best tradition of writers
looking out for each other, the key to this is that the people who
negotiated it created something that potentially benefits all
writers who qualify. That's a tremendous accomplishment. It's not
the typical Hollywood image to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, writers who share a credit as a co-author
of a movie will receive 1 percent of the gross profits, and writers
who have sole credit will receive 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In this instance, the gross profits are defined as any sums left
after the studio recoups the costs of producing, distributing and
marketing the films. But, significantly, it comes before the studio
pays itself what is known as a distribution fee, which can total as
much as 30 percent of gross box office receipts, and before the
studio pays out points to others, like the director or stars.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current Guild contract, the minimum fee is $82,444,
but on much sought after scripts, the fee has risen to as much as
$4 million, and there are several dozen writers who command minimum
fees of $1 million per script.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, a movie costs about $60 million to produce and
market. Therefore, under the Columbia agreement, if such a film
were to earn $200 million at the box office, a writer with a sole
credit would receive an additional $2.8 million over and above the
fee.

<P>
   Other companies were reluctant to comment publicly, but some
pointed out that at least in some instances this has already been
done. Dreamworks SKG, for instance, announced when it started
several years ago that writers might be offered a share of the
gross profits of films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good for them, but it's something we've been doing for a
while,'' said Terry Press, Dreamworks' head of marketing, who added
that her company had not spelled out firm criteria for who
qualifies for a slice of the profits.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Bass, one of the leaders of the group and the screenwriter
of ``Rain Man,'' said: ``I don't think any of us has any idea what
effect this will have in the short run, but in the long run, once
the glass ceiling against writers is broken, the landscape will be
changed forever. Our point is that writers are the one partner who
is not really accepted as a partner. We want more respect for what
we contribute to the film process.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced on Thursday is significant not only
because it insures the select group of writers will receive such
``points,'' but because it establishes certain formal criteria for
the participation. The negotiators of the agreement _ in addition
to Mr. Bass and Mr. Kazan they were Tom Schulman, Frank Pierson and
Phil Alden Robinson, along with an entertainment lawyer, Alan
Wertheimer _ said that more than 200 writers in total would qualify
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, about 35 successful writers agreed to the terms and,
in addition, agreed to provide Columbia Pictures at least one
script each within the next four years. That is known as a blind
commitment, since the subject or style of the script is left open,
and the studio is not obliged to buy the script.
</P>
<P>
   Any writer who qualifies will receive similar terms from
Columbia Pictures: they will receive a fee equal to what they had
received on their last deal, plus the profit participation.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria are: having received a nomination from either the
Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences or the Writers Guild
for top screenplay in any year; having received a regular fee of
$750,000 or more per script; or having received $1 million or more
for a script offered on spec, that is, written without having
received an assignment from a studio.
</P>
<P>
   The writers who negotiated the deal emphasized that, by
including the nominations in the list of criteria, the arrangement
will benefit many women writers, who have traditionally not been
paid as much as men for their scripts.

ON 20TH ANNIVERSARY, FEWER IRANIANS IDENTIFY WITH THE ISLAMIC
REVOLUTION

   TEHRAN, Iran _ These are the ``days of dawn,'' the 10 heady days
that brought Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini back from exile, saw the
collapse of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's regime and are celebrated
this week across Iran in observance of the 20th anniversary of the
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, state television has replayed grainy footage of
Ayatollah Khomeini's arrival from France, as he is escorted step by
step down the stairs of an Air France jet. Again and again,
reverent tales are retold, like a children's story in which the
ayatollah was introduced as ``the good imam who rid Iran of the
evil shah.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ingrained lessons of the revolution, a teen-age girl
asked Ayatollah Khomeini's successor in a televised meeting the
other day, ``Why did the Islamic revolution take place?''
</P>
<P>
   The question reflects a widening gap between Iranians and the
defining event of their country's recent past. More than half of
Iran's 68 million people have been born since the events that
toppled a king and stunned the world; millions more are barely old
enough to remember them.
</P>
<P>
   And the young are not the only ones asking questions. The
revolution that put power into the hands of Shiite Muslim clerics
enjoyed broad popular support at the time. But today, disillusioned
by a generation of experience and emboldened by new political
ferment, millions of Iranians from all walks of life now feel cut
adrift, regarding the revolution as no longer relevant to today's
problems.
</P>
<P>
   In scores of interviews around Iran in the last two months,
those were sentiments voiced by clerks, cleaners, farmers,
professionals and others in big cities like Tehran and rural areas
in the farmland around the northwestern city of Tabriz.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like sheep, following others,'' one of them, Abil, a
60-year-old farmer wearing striped trousers, a plaid jacket and a
shabby black felt hat, recalled the revolution, which he once
backed with enthusiasm. ``Wherever the shepherd led, we followed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadiq Zibakallam, a political scientist who frequently delivers
lectures around the country, said he was encountering a similar
sense of confusion. ``One of the most common questions that I come
across is, `Where are we going?''' Zibakallam said. ``That reflects
the anxiety and helplessness that many Iranians are going
through.''
</P>
<P>
   Much Iranian discontent was channeled into the election of
Mohammed Khatami, the president who won a landslide victory two
years ago over a candidate supported by the ruling clerical
establishment. Khatami, who has pressed for greater social and
political openness, is seen by some Iranians as someone who might
lead the country into what might be truly called a
post-revolutionary era.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami remains part of that establishment, as signified by
the black clerical turban without which he almost certainly would
not have been elected. And even he has expressed concern that
Iranians might be tempted to turn away from the past and to discard
cornerstones just 20 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poisonous winds are blowing inside and outside the country,''
Khatami warned in one anniversary address the other day, ``and
enemies are attempting to separate you from the Islamic Revolution
and the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The president did not elaborate. But in recent months, Iran has
appeared increasingly troubled, as the murders of dissident writers
were revealed to have been carried out by rogue intelligence
agents, prompting public protests that in turn met with violence
from unpoliced thugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though two decades have passed, it is images of the
revolution that still dominate Tehran, where the picture of
Ayatollah Khomeini, who died in 1989, glowers down from countless
buildings and office walls.
</P>
<P>
   And the very structure of the government, headed by a supreme
religious leader, now Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is regarded as
God's representative on earth, is a product of the revolution that
created the world's first Islamic theocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Iranian officials readily concede that young Iranians in
particular appear to have little idea of what the revolution was
about and that keeping memories alive is much of what the
anniversary celebration is about.
</P>
<P>
   In the kickoff to a frenzy of nationwide ceremonies, the exact
moment that Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran, on Feb. 1, 1979,
was marked 20 years to the moment later, at 9:33 a.m. on Monday, as
school bells and train whistles were sounded across Iran.
</P>
<P>
   A helicopter on the outskirts of the capital later showered
flowers on the graves of thousands of people killed in what the
ayatollah, during 15 years of exile in France, made a popular
cause: toppling the American-backed shah.
</P>
<P>
   The shah's regime finally fell on Feb. 11, 1979, after days of
street battles, and the celebration is to reach its peak that day
in a mass rally and military parade. In the meantime, film, music
and theater festivals are under way, as is an exhibition showcasing
the country's achievements since 1979, under banners like one that
read: ``The 10 days of dawn gave our nation the sweet fruit of
victory.''
</P>
<P>
   To questions about why the revolution took place, Ayatollah
Khamenei and others have pointed to corruption under the shah and
to what they have suggested was Iran's old place as an outpost of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no mention is being made of the darker side of a revolution
that others remember with horror. More than 10,000 people,
including some of Ayatollah Khomeini's own aides, were executed in
a wave of terror that followed his return.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has mention been made of the economy's downward turn in the
years that followed the revolution, in a country where high oil
prices and a much smaller population had created prosperity under
the shah.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Iranians had seemed willing to forgive hardships, on
the grounds that the revolution was not about economics. But in the
conversations around Iran this year, the state of the economy was a
constant theme of the many people who said that on the anniversary
of the revolution, they saw little to celebrate.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only me,'' said Ali, a 37-year-old cleaner, who was
interviewed as he swept the stairs of an apartment complex on a
chilly night in Tehran. ``Everybody gets angry. These clerics don't
know what kind of problems we have. They don't care, so how can
they think of solving it? They don't even know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed, 39, a carpet weaver in northwest Iran, said, ``We
haven't had a good meal in 20 years.'' He works at a loom in the
two-room house he shares with his wife and his elderly parents and
says he can barely provide for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about the revolution,'' he said. ``The problem is
we can't live.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogieh, 55, a mother of five who sat wrapped in a shapeless
chador on the floor of her family home in a nearby village, said,
``We believe in God, but we did not accept Khomeini and his
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents who defended the revolution said they believed its
critics were holding it to the wrong standard. ``I think the most
important change was independence, not being a colony,'' said
Nasser Sarkhan, 29, a member of Iran's volunteer paramilitary
force, who are known as basijis.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who expressed criticism of the government, few
ordinary Iranians would allow their names to be published, saying
that they feared reprisals from security forces. But some said they
would allow their photographs to be published, as long as the name
of their village did not appear in print.
</P>
<P>
   And many spoke with a boldness that is new to Iran in expressing
not only resentment toward the clerics, widely described as aloof
and indifferent, but sometimes, even vague nostalgia for the days
of the shah. ``He was such a gentleman; he stood so straight; he
represented the glory of the country,'' murmured an official on
duty this week at Saadabad in north Tehran, where busloads of
soldiers and schoolchildren were touring the grounds of the shah's
old summer palace.
</P>
<P>
   Such candor, voiced within earshot of a foreign reporter, would
have been unheard of here just a few years ago. But the election of
Khatami has been followed, in newspapers, by an opening of debate
between his supporters and those of his more conservative rivals,
and this seems to have left ordinary Iranians more forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   In the interviews, many volunteered their own stories of the
last 20 years, in which the trauma of an eight-year war with Iraq
and the struggle to make a living formed the main chapters, not the
revolution itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning of the revolution, I supported them,'' said
Seifollah, 55, a farmer who grows carrots and turnips, as he sat on
the floor beside his wife, Rogieh. ``But they made promises they
didn't keep.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple showed visitors a family album that included
photographs of their eldest son, now 33, as a soldier during the
war; they said he was forced into service at the age of 18 by
Revolutionary Guards who pounded on their door in the dead of
night.
</P>
<P>
   Among dozens of people interviewed, in three cities and several
villages, only those with direct ties to the government, including
the soldier, a cleric and a merchant who sells government goods,
said they still identified with the revolution.

   WASHINGTON _ The hangdog look on their faces was unmistakable as
they sat waiting for the make-or-break votes Thursday, at the
prosecutors' table on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the House managers' best arguments, all those
concessions they believe they made, 70 Senators rose to their feet
Thursday and, in effect, voted to bring the trial to an end next
week without calling a single live witness.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could argue they didn't have a trial,'' said Rep. Bill
McCollum, R-Fla., one of the House managers. ``Is that frustrating?
Of course, it has been frustrating. Is it frustrating every day?
There is a point after which it's not frustrating personally
because you know it's just going to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But it isn't the thing we think is right,'' McCollum added.
``I don't think history will judge them well for making that
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Since they crossed the divide between the House and Senate, the
13 House prosecutors in the impeachment trial have faced a string
of hurdles before a Senate eager to shoosh them up, politely, but
unfailingly.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly and privately, they have been lambasted for their
zealousness, criticized for their political naivete and
strong-armed into ditching their grandiose plans for a ``full
trial.'' A self-righteous bunch, their critics say.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning they wanted as many as 12 witnesses to tell
their tales in the well of Senate. It never happened. They wanted
President Clinton to testify. He never did. Even their hopes for
taking reams of depositions were downsized. They deposed three
witnesses, and even then they were forced to choose: Betty Currie
or Vernon Jordan, the president's secretary or his confidante.
Jordan won out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really are coming from different worlds,'' said Rep. Asa
Hutchinson, R-Ark., one of the House managers, referring to the
House and the Senate. ``From the very beginning we're thinking
like, a real trial, and they are thinking in terms of the unique
procedures.''
</P>
<P>
   As they walked off the Senate floor Thursday, the House
prosecutors tried to flash the best light on the Senate's decision.
They said they were ``well-received'' by the Senate overall, and
some even talked about the bonds they have formed with certain
Senators.
</P>
<P>
   And they spoke again of obligation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House has given us a responsibility,'' Hutchinson said.
``They did not tell us to go to the Senate for a few days and throw
up our hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the chairman of the Judiciary
Committee and the lead prosecutor, softened his tone a bit. Asked
whether the Senate was considering any of his recommendations early
in the day, he replied, ``They didn't hang up on me, let's put it
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They've treated us nicely,'' said Hyde. ``I regret the
implication that there is friction between us.''
</P>
<P>
   But nick the surface, and prosecutors say it has been difficult
not to smell a whiff of condescension from the well-scrubbed
Senate, no matter how courtly their manner.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson said that, while the prosecutors have been treated
respectfully, despite their pleas for more witnesses and a heftier
investigation, the gang of 13 can't help but quip about their
second-class status when they get together for meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a little bit of humor that goes around the committee,
a sense of being unwanted from time to time, and we joke about
it,'' Hutchinson said. From that has sprung a sense of camaraderie.
``We have had a lot of rocks thrown at us,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear to McCollum that senators screen the Senate
chamber, searching for breaches of decorum, just as mothers at a
debutante ball might crane their necks to root out undesirables.
That attitude, he said, helped stymie the prosecutors' case for
witnesses, especially Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just didn't want to, as White House counsel said, sully
the Senate floor,'' McCollum said. ``It wasn't a question of right
or wrong, fairness, good, bad or indifferent. It was just something
about letting Monica Lewinsky come to the floor. They didn't want
to let that happen. I didn't agree with that. It's a Senate thing,
I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., who is one of the managers,
complained about the lack of ``ham sandwiches'' in the Senate
cloakroom, when asked about his disappointment with the other
chamber.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Hyde who best summed up the relationship between the
Senate and the 13 prosecutors, at least through the eyes of the
prosecutors. ``You view us as reformed alcoholics,'' Hyde told a
senator one afternoon, a big grin on his face. ``You're very proud
of what we attempted to do in our lives. You just don't want us
hanging out on the porch all that long.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, a newly independent Azerbaijan emerged from the
collapsing Soviet Union. Now Azerbaijan is offering to be host to
the first American military base on former Soviet territory.
Washington should pass up the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Basing American troops in Azerbaijan would needlessly complicate
relations with Russia, Armenia and Iran. It would also bring the
United States into too close a military relationship with
Azerbaijan's autocratic ruler, President Heydar Aliyev.
</P>
<P>
   Washington already has significant security ties with Azerbaijan
through NATO's Partnership for Peace and a defense cooperation
agreement. But some in Congress are pressing for even closer
military cooperation, like the transfer of excess Pentagon
equipment. The idea is to build up Azerbaijan and other former
Soviet republics as buffers against potential future threats from
Russia or Iran. Many energy companies, seeking continued access to
oil reserves, also advocate closer ties.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington must be cautious in deepening its military
involvement. Azerbaijan and Armenia remain enmeshed in a conflict
over the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, now occupied by
Armenia. Washington should remain neutral and try to mediate a
political settlement. Instead Aliyev is courting an American
military presence to offset the military support Russia gives
Armenia.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan also fails to meet minimal standards of democracy and
human rights. Detainees are tortured, demonstrations suppressed and
journalists arrested. Last year's presidential election got failing
marks from international observers.
</P>
<P>
   Azerbaijan must improve in these areas and resolve the
Nagorno-Karabakh dispute. Closer American security links can wait
until it does.

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 5:
</P>
<P>
   In a city of crumbling bridges, aging water pipes and antique
computer systems, there is no more urgent capital priority than
building and repairing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proposed a novel way of tapping
an additional $2.5 billion for New York City schools in the next
five years. He wants to create an agency that would issue bonds for
school construction, paying them off with revenues expected from
the settlement of New York state's lawsuit against tobacco
companies. Although we were initially skeptical, the idea is worth
pursuing if its problems can be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The need for school expansion and repairs is beyond doubt. The
Board of Education has proposed a five-year, $11 billion program to
create room for a flood of new students and to upgrade existing
facilities. In his latest budget, Giuliani said the city would
supply $6 billion of the funds, with the rest coming from federal
and state sources.
</P>
<P>
   But the city faces a problem in finding the money, as it is at
the limits of its borrowing capacity. The state Constitution limits
debt to a fixed percentage of the value of the city's real
property, a ceiling reached a couple of years ago. The state
Legislature in 1997 created a new city agency with borrowing
authority, but now even this agency is close to its cap.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than ask the Legislature to increase the cap for this
agency, Giuliani wants the city to create another new corporation
to issue $2.5 billion in bonds, secured by $6.7 billion in revenue
from the tobacco settlement over the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Both the mayor and the city comptroller, Alan Hevesi, must
investigate potential legal problems, including the current dispute
over whether any of the tobacco money might have to be shared with
the federal and state governments. In addition, there is some
skepticism in Albany that the city can create a new debt-incurring
agency without legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, Giuliani should have used the city's
multibillion-dollar surpluses to pay down debt or pay for capital
projects. Some worry that too much of the budget is being siphoned
off for debt service. Still, if the legal and financial problems
can be cleared up, tapping the tobacco funds seems a prudent step
to rebuilding the city's deteriorating school system.

NEW PAPERS FILED IN SUIT OVER DEATH OF CELTICS STAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Legal papers filed Thursday in Suffolk Superior Court
present strikingly contrasting views of the medical treatment given
by Dr. Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. to Boston Celtics star Reggie Lewis in
the months before Lewis's fatal heart attack in July 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The documents also shed new light on the question of whether
Lewis used cocaine during his lifetime and if the damage to his
heart was cocaine-related.
</P>
<P>
   The papers, filed in connection with the malpractice suit
brought against Mudge by Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, focus
in part on whether the cardiologist overlooked prior test results
and medical opinions that indicated that Lewis had a
life-threatening heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for Harris-Lewis alleged that Mudge failed to
disseminate among his medical team at the Brigham and Women's
Hospital the findings of tests done on Lewis at New England Baptist
Hospital days before.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge defended the medical treatment he provided Lewis. Also, he
alleged that both Reggie and Donna Harris-Lewis had repeatedly
denied to him as well as the doctors at the Baptist who examined
him that he had used cocaine. Donna Harris-Lewis in fact became
agitated when Mudge first asked Reggie Lewis whether he had used
cocaine in the past, stating, according to Mudge:
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs, drugs, that is all they ask about. Just because he is
not (Larry) Bird. Don't insult my husband, he is a professional
world-class athlete. . . . They would never ask Larry about drugs.
. . . Drugs, drugs, drugs. Why can't they think of anything else?''
</P>
<P>
   But in a written response to the plaintiff's questions filed
Thursday, Mudge said that two weeks before his death Lewis had told
him in a private conversation that he had used cocaine but had
stopped. In addition, Mudge alleges that six weeks after Lewis's
death, his widow told him over the phone that ``Reggie's mother was
a cocaine addict and Reggie had died of the poisons his mother gave
him.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, lawyers for Mrs. Harris-Lewis denied that Lewis had
used cocaine or other drugs and even if he had, it did not relieve
Mudge of the responsibility of properly diagnosing that his heart
was severely scarred and providing him adequate medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie Lewis came to Dr. Mudge with a serious medical
(condition). Dr. Mudge refused to recognize this condition despite
ample evidence and warnings of many prominent physicians. As a
result, this 27-year-old husband and father of two infants was put
in peril and allowed to die,'' according to a motion written by the
lawyers for Harris-Lewis, Robert G. Harley and Bridget Asaro of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The malpractice case is scheduled to go to trial in May or June
and with no settlement in sight the documents filed Thursday
reflect each side's strategy. While a state medical tribunal found
sufficient evidence for Harris-Lewis's case to proceed to trial in
1997, other malpractice lawyers say she faces a difficult hurdle of
proving not that Mudge's diagnosis was wrong, but that the Celtics
star could have survived even with the best medical advice.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harris-Lewis are seeking to show that Mudge made a
``determined effort'' to discount the unanimous opinion of the team
of other cardiologists, who consulted on Lewis's condition at the
Baptist, that his heart was seriously damaged. Without citing any
motivation for Mudge's actions, the lawyers for Harris-Lewis allege
that Mudge misread or purposefully minimized the results of an
echocardiogram done at the Baptist Hospital that showed that the
left ventricle of Lewis's heart was seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for Mudge, meanwhile, are focusing on the allegation
that Lewis used cocaine and that his hiding that fact from his
doctors impeded Mudge from making a proper diagnosis. In addition,
they contend that Mudge had given the Lewises privately a far more
sober assessment of the condition of Lewis's heart than Mudge was
saying publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, captain of the Celtics and their leading scorer,
collapsed during a playoff game against the Charlotte Hornets at
the Boston Garden on April 29, 1993. Disenchanted with the
treatment he was receiving at New England Baptist during the next
few days, Lewis transferred to the Brigham and Women's Hospital
where he remained under the care of Mudge and his medical team for
nearly three months.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, 1993, Lewis suffered a fatal heart attack while
shooting baskets at Brandeis University in Waltham. His sudden
death cast a pall over the region, saddening far more than Celtics
fans. Lewis had become popular throughout the city for his
community work, and his death shocked a community that prides
itself on the superior medical care of its hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents filed by his lawyers, Mudge was
unaware that Lewis had resumed playing basketball before he
suffered his fatal attack. Mudge believed that Lewis was
restricting his exercise to stretching and light aerobics, but
nothing that would break a sweat. Two weeks before, on July 12,
Mudge received results of recently completed cardiac tests that had
been done on Lewis in Los Angeles as part of a third medical
opinion on his condition.
</P>
<P>
   The test showed that Lewis's heart condition had deteriorated
seriously and Mudge agreed with the assessment of one of the
cardiologists, Dr. J. Michael Criley of Los Angeles, that Lewis
should not play basketball at all. ``We (Mudge and Lewis) discussed
the reports and the fact that there was no explanation for the
change in Mr. Lewis's condition which we were seeing. I queried,
`Reggie, have you ever taken cocaine?' '' Mudge said in his written
responses to interrogatories given by the lawyers for Harris-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked again have you ever taken cocaine and Mr. Lewis
indicated he had. I responded, `You have got to stop. Cocaine
causes all this, and at that point there was silence,' '' Mudge
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In the papers filed by her lawyers, Harris-Lewis criticized
Mudge for not realizing at the outset of his examination of Lewis
that his heart was seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive tests on Lewis at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
Mudge announced at a widely reported press conference on May 10,
1993, that the reason for the Celtics star's collapse during the
playoff game was not any serious heart defect.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said Lewis's collapse had been caused by a
neurological condition that resulted in his heartbeat slowing down
on exertion instead of increasing. Lewis's condition could be
treated with medication and he could be expected to return as a
professional basketball player, Mudge said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Mudge's conclusion was based on apparently flawed
decision-making, a willful attempt to play down the results of the
tests and medical conclusions reached about Lewis's condition by
the 12 cardiologists who examined him at the Baptist, lawyers for
Harris-Lewis stated.
</P>
<P>
   Asaro's motion charged that Mudge failed to share with the
doctors and medical staff who were conducting tests on Lewis at
Brigham and Women's the results of the tests done previously at the
New England Baptist Hospital that gave strong evidence that Lewis's
heart had structural damage.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Senate Republican proposal to rebuke President
Clinton's misconduct all but collapsed Thursday after Democrats
closed ranks to reject it. Democrats immediately promoted their own
plan to censure the president, but that version received a cool
reception from many Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   With an end to the four-week impeachment trial in sight and
Clinton's acquittal virtually preordained, both parties are
jockeying to express their dismay at the president's behavior and
protect themselves from any public backlash that Clinton is eluding
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   While they may sound similar, the competing reprimands serve
different purposes. Republicans want the Senate to stipulate that
Clinton lied under oath and obstructed justice, but not remove him
for that. Democrats want to condemn the president's behavior but
clear him of any impeachable offense.
</P>
<P>
   The impasse the senators struck Thursday was as much over the
timing of any vote on the rival rebukes _ before or after the vote
on the articles _ as on their actual wording. Each side is also
trying to wrap their resolution in the mantle of bipartisanship, a
tall order at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans sought to approve a ``findings of fact'' that
concluded Clinton committed wrongdoing without removing him from
office. Under this approach, senators would vote on the findings
before the final impeachment votes and, if approved, the findings
would become a part of the official trial record. Convicting the
president would require 67 votes, but the findings-of-fact would
need only a 51-vote majority.
</P>
<P>
   Republican sponsors said they would put the motion up for a vote
only if at least five Democrats backed the plan. When none did
Thursday, saying it was unconstitutional, Republicans all but
pulled the plug on the proposal. ``It's in desperate need of a
life-support system,'' said Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   Majority Leader Trent Lott refused just yet to pronounce the
idea dead, saying after Thursday's proceedings that senators ``will
keep talking about that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, led by Dianne Feinstein of California, rushed to
fill the void and revived their idea for a freestanding censure, to
be considered outside the trial proceedings. Mrs. Feinstein said
her two-page proposal _ which she declined to make public Thursday
_ focused on the president's misconduct while the findings-of-fact
gleaned their essence from the two impeachment articles, perjury
and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, embraced the censure resolution and
sought support for it among other Republicans. At least two other
Republicans, John Chafee of Rhode Island and Richard Shelby of
Alabama, said Thursday they would support a rebuke. ``A censure
resolution that is thorough, tough and bipartisan would be in
order,'' Shelby said.
</P>
<P>
   But most other Republicans oppose censure or are deeply
skeptical. ``We want finality, and that's a `guilty' or `not
guilty' vote, and let the chips fall where they may,'' said Sen.
Charles Grassley, R-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., who opposes censure and
findings-of-fact, said, ``Anything that we do that's outside the
parameters of what we originally talked about is offering political
cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he is so opposed to censure that
he left the door open to waging a filibuster to block it.
</P>
<P>
   A compromise suggested Thursday by Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., would be to adjourn the trial briefly next week, vote on
the Democratic censure plan, and then resume the trial to vote on
the impeachment articles.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we wait to vote on censure, there'll be members on their
side who will be mad and members on our side who'll say, `It's
over. Let's leave it that way,'' Moynihan said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   This approach would likely win virtually unanimous Democratic
support and perhaps that of many Republicans, and sidestep the
Democrats' concern of making a reprimand a part of the formal
impeachment record.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, however, dismissed this idea as a gimmick.
``Now that sounds like a real concoction,'' said Sen. Olympia
Snowe, R-Maine, an author of the findings-of-fact. ``That is really
trying to jury-rig the Constitution and the impeachment trial in
order to achieve what they want as a political goal.''
</P>
<P>
   A bipartisan agreement seemed miles apart Thursday night, though
many senators said that was the tonic the impeachment proceedings
needed right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``A joint censure is the only way to do this at this point,''
said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. ``Once the leadership is committed to
do it, it will not be that difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott, who supports the findings of fact, said senators had until
Wednesday to hammer out a resolution.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trial is in recess Friday, to allow the House prosecutors
and White House lawyers time to prepare for Saturday's session,
when each side will have up to three hours to show portions of the
videotaped depositions.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Closing arguments are to begin Monday, and senators could begin
their deliberations Tuesday. There will be a vote to suspend the
rules, which require closed deliberations, and open the final
debate to public viewing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Between now and then, senators said there would likely be
intense activity off the Senate floor to win a majority for a
censure or findings-of-fact resolution.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, for example, are still hoping to persuade a few
Democrats, like Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Bob Graham of
Florida, to embrace the findings-of-fact. But Democratic aides said
Thursday night it was highly unlikely any Democrats would defect
now.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that senators might not be able to bridge this partisan
divide, Republicans and Democrats were already preparing defenses
against the charge that, without some form of rebuke, the president
would be vindicated of all wrongdoing.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any president that has been impeached and tried
by the Senate, even though he may not be removed, could feel like
he's gotten off scot-free,'' Lott said.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finding a graceful way to end the acrimonious proceedings will
be a challenge, most senators concede. ``Sometimes when you get
right in the middle of a storm, it's difficult to see all the
details,'' Kerrey said. ``Right now, I think everybody but us has
got it figured out that we're all standing here buck-naked, and
we've just got to end it.''

</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Hastert, the new House speaker, says he wants to avoid
the blunders of his predecessor, Newt Gingrich. He is headed in the
wrong direction. The other day Hastert said that campaign finance
reform would stay on the back burner while lawmakers take up Social
Security, health care, tax and spending issues. That course would
effectively bury a reform bill that commands overwhelming
bipartisan support and can be passed quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign reform measure sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays
of Connecticut and Martin Meehan of Massachusetts passed the House
last year by a vote of 252 to 179. Sixty-one Republicans defied
Gingrich and supported the bill. Republicans say even more of their
party members would be willing to get aboard this year if Hastert
does not make campaign reform a partisan issue, as Gingrich did.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether the new speaker will let Republicans
vote their consciences or follow the demands of Tom DeLay, the
party whip. DeLay was the new speaker's biggest booster, but now is
the time for Hastert to declare his independence and show that he,
and not his former benefactor, is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would ban ``soft money'' donations to
political parties, closing a loophole through which corporations,
special interests, rich donors and labor unions have poured money
into political campaigns. If the bill can get to the Senate by
March, there will be time to build pressure on Trent Lott and other
Republican leaders to let the majority of senators win passage
there. The danger is that if action does not occur soon,
congressional and presidential candidates will already be embarked
on raising hundreds of millions of dollars in unregulated soft
money for their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Gingrich tried to block the bill, House members
organized a petition forcing it to the floor. Greatly embarrassed,
Gingrich retreated and eventually allowed a vote. Supporters of
reform should get ready for the same tactics to pressure Hastert.
Better yet, he should heed their demands and bring the bill to the
floor now.

   LOS ANGELES _ Sundays for the Millar family of Lancaster are as
sacred as any in a Mormon home. It is a holy day of rest.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on many Sundays, Ryan Millar violated this tenet. Volleyball
was too important. Besides, there were plenty of club tournaments
on that day, and he felt an obligation to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Members of his ward agreed with his decision to play, partly
because of his talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone accepted the fact that in Ryan's case he's an
exception to the rule, like Steve Young,'' Millar's father, Steven,
said. ``He has to play on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   And like Young, Ryan Millar, a 6-foot-9 senior middle blocker,
has blossomed into an elite talent. Behind his 133 kills in 209
attempts and 58 blocks, Millar has helped No. 3-ranked Brigham
Young to a 8-0, 6-0 start heading into tonight's Mountain Pacific
Sports Federation conference match at Cal State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Millar, who turned 21 last month, has been named
the college Freshman of the Year, an All-America twice and the
state of Utah's College Athlete of the Year. Also, his uniform
might be retired at Highland High. More importantly for Millar, he
has a decent, albeit difficult shot at making the 2000 Olympic
team.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, there is the matter of winning BYU's first national
championship in volleyball. The Cougars never have advanced to the
Final Four, and Millar could have attended Pepperdine and reached
those heights. Instead, he chose BYU and now has the chance to make
school history.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing his best volleyball ever,'' BYU coach Carl McGown
said. ``He's a very good volleyball player. He's a lot of fun to
play with and coach.''
</P>
<P>
   It all began in the Antelope Valley, where Millar was introduced
to the sport by his older brother John. Ryan admits his faith
sometimes didn't receive the priority it should.
</P>
<P>
   ``With any faith, we're supposed to keep Sunday holy. It's
supposed to be a day of rest,'' he said from his home in Provo,
Utah. ``Back then, I always wanted to play volleyball. I didn't
care what day it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Millar was significant in putting volleyball on the map in the
Antelope Valley and helped Highland become the area's first
dominant program. His junior year, the Bulldogs reached the
Southern Section Division II final, and Millar earned a scholarship
to BYU.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure my whole ward loved getting exposure,'' Millar said.
``My junior year, a lot of the team was (Latter-day Saints). Four
starters were LDS. We were pretty tight. To get that exposure for
the church, they (church members) were excited.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people know I'm not going to be able to go to church
on Sunday,'' Millar said. ``They bring up (San Francisco
quarterback and BYU alumnus) Steve Young. A lot of leaders say how
I can use volleyball and my status to do good things for the
church.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Kimel, the university's assistant athletic director of
academics and a church member, said the choice of what to do on
Sunday is a personal one.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got to make the decision,'' Kimel said. ``If this is his
choice, then he has to live his life and let the chips fall where
they may.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is what the church wants, Millar is all too happy to
oblige. He and his wife Suzanne plan to move to Colorado Springs
this summer so Ryan can devote his time to making the U.S. National
Team.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Wilde, the national team's assistant coach and former coach
and All-America at Pepperdine, said Millar only has about six
months to make the team. No collegian has ever made the national
team in such a short time. Plus, there are four other middle
blockers now on the team, and three others _ including Millar _ who
are getting looks. Wilde expects the U.S. will take only three
middles to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wilde recognizes Millar's advantages. He is a complete
player, capable of passing and playing all the way around. And he
has the skills to play at the national and international level,
having shown that last summer when he worked out with the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tougher road,'' Wilde said. ``He's got all kinds of
physical talent. It will come down to how he will respond this
summer.''

ANALYSTS PREDICT LOSS FOR DOLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. -- Bad weather and international
financial turmoil will take a sizeable bite out of Dole Food Co.
Inc.'s profits when it reports fourth quarter results today.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of five brokers surveyed by Boston-based First
Call is that Dole will lose 14 cents a share during the 1998 fourth
quarter, down from 38 cents in the like period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' estimates have the loss ranging from 8 cents to 15
cents a share, First Call said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the Westlake Village company, the world's largest
fresh fruit producer and marketer, is expected to earn $1.84 per
share versus $2.65 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Weak demand as a result of financial upheaval in Asia and Russia
are also expected to have contributed to depressed earnings for
Dole, said Chuck Hill, research director at First Call.
</P>
<P>
   The company tracks 17 big food companies, and the entire sector
has been rocked by international developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings for companies in that index are expected to be down 5
percent. Dole has some problems of its own, but the industry as a
whole is not doing particularly well this quarter,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has already signaled that it would experience turbulence
during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the company said it would take a $100 million
charge during 1998's last quarter to cover costs associated with
damage wrought to its Central American banana plantations and
Honduran beverage operations by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Dole said that it expected a fourth quarter
operating loss of between $3 million to $6 million, or 5 cents to
10 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Dole draws more than $200 million a year for distributing and
bottling soft drinks in Honduras for Coca-Cola Co. That operation
and Dole's fruit harvesting operations were shuttered for three
weeks after Hurricane Mitch pounded the area at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Dole calculates it will take two years to repair damage to its
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Dole said an additional $20 million charge would be
necessary after freezing temperatures in late December devastated
citrus crops.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN STATES RESISTING MOVE TO BROADEN HATE-CRIME LAWS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Last fall national revulsion over the murder of Matthew
Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming, seemed strong enough to
push legislatures in the Rockies to expand hate crime laws to
include ``sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   But this winter lawmakers in Colorado, Idaho, Montana and Utah
have defeated bills that would add sexual orientation to lists of
groups protected by existing hate crime laws. And in Wyoming
legislators have defeated all efforts to pass that state's first
hate crime law.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, which has the region's lone Democratic-controlled
legislature, lawmakers are expected to pass a hate crime bill that
includes sexual orientation. But Gov. Gary Johnson, a Republican,
has vowed a veto, saying, ``All crimes are hate crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Lobel, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, a Washington-based group that pushes for hate crime
legislation, said: ``We are incredibly disappointed. We look to the
Wyoming legislature for leadership and legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The votes came as the FBI released its latest tally of hate
crimes on Jan. 21. In 1997, sexual orientation was the motivation
for 14 percent of reported hate crimes, or 1,102 crimes out of
8,049, the bureau said. Under the bureau's voluntary reporting
system, police departments covering about 80 percent of the
country's population report their hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 40 states have some kind of hate crime legislation,
generally laws that increase fines and add jail time for crimes
motivated by hatred of a specific group. Of the 40 states, 19 have
laws that specify sexual orientation as a category for protection.
Ten states, largely in the South and Southwest, do not have any
hate crime legislation at all.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the Rockies, Legislatures in Hawaii, Oklahoma, and
Virginia are considering hate crime bills that include sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Antipathy toward hate crime legislation seems to stem from
several factors, including a belief that the laws would confer
special rights on the groups named and a backlash against publicity
resulting from the Matthew Shepard killing.
</P>
<P>
   After ``the vicious smear campaign'' by the national press in
the coverage of the murder of the gay 21-year-old, Wyoming became
the true victim of bias crime, Sally Vaughan, a resident of
Remington, Wyo., complained two weeks ago at a legislative hearing
in Cheyenne.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Thompson, who recently formed a Wyoming group, Citizens for
Equal Protection, urged lawmakers in Cheyenne to protect all
citizens ``and not just a few groups who claim victim status.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming, a Republican, gave general support
to a hate crime bill but also warned legislators about yielding to
``external pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, a hate crime bill that six weeks ago seemed destined
for passage died in the Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The part of the bill that made people the most uncomfortable
was the provision for sexual orientation,'' state Sen. John
Schiffer, the committee chairman, said Thursday, adding, ``My
feeling right now is that the committee is tired of discussing bias
crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic member of the committee, Sen. Rae Lynn Job, said:
``A lot of people felt that by passing this we were going to give
some people more protection than others.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Montana, a bill to add sexual orientation to an existing hate
crime bill died in committee last week. In its place, the state
Senate passed a bill that would allow a judge to increase penalties
for a crime motivated by hate, but it did not specify any protected
groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language is over broad, vague, lacking in specific terms
and will be constitutionally challenged,'' Steve Doherty, a
Democratic state senator, said. ``It is nice sounding fluff.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to add sexual orientation to the list of hate
crimes has been hampered by the reluctance of the Shepard family to
allow their son to become a martyr for a political cause. ``It's a
very frightening concept as a parent that your son now becomes a
martyr, a public figure for the world,'' Judy Shepard, the young
man's mother, told Dateline NBC in an interview that is to be aired
on Friday night. ``He's just our son.''
</P>
<P>
   In December, Mrs. Shepard and her husband, Dennis, set up the
Matthew Shepard Foundation, saying in a statement, ``The foundation
will be dedicated to the principle of helping people move beyond
tolerance to embrace and rejoice in diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, in Casper, Wyo., the family's hometown, Mrs. Shepard
announced an International Hike Against Hate and Violence to
stretch 2,500 miles from Skagway, Alaska, to Laramie, Wyo., this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview for the March issue of Vanity Fair, Mrs. Shepard
described Matthew as having the posture of a victim. ``He was the
kind of person whom you just look at and know if you hurt him that
he's going to take it _ that there's nothing he can do about it,
verbally or physically,'' she said.

EDITORIAL: COUNTDOWN TO CENSURE   
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, Feb. 5:
</P>
<P>
   The fact that 25 Republicans joined with Democrats to vote
against calling Monica Lewinsky for live testimony means that the
Senate is intent on ending President Clinton's impeachment trial.
That 70-to-30 vote also suggested that the majority leader, Trent
Lott, feels he has stretched things out long enough to placate
hard-liners in his party.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after it was taken, Lott authorized another conservative
Republican, Sen. Bob Bennett of Utah, to approach pro-censure
Democrats about drafting a bipartisan resolution that would attract
some Republican co-sponsors. The real action now is taking place in
party caucuses and behind-the-scenes negotiations over how to frame
a censure resolution that will carry most of the Democrats and at
least a handful of Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative Republican plan to substitute a ``finding of
fact'' for censure has died for lack of support within the
Republican caucus. That plan was offered in good faith by Sen.
Susan Collins. Her draft description of Clinton's false testimony
under oath and his attempts to impede justice is supported by the
evidence. But her plan to bifurcate the final vote into separate
ballots on the evidence and on removal is constitutionally unsound
and offended a bipartisan bloc of strict constructionists.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will be determined by another bipartisan bloc _
moderates on both sides of the aisle who want to go down in history
as being opposed to Clinton's irresponsible conduct and as being
un-hoodwinked by his lies. The jockeying over the language of the
censure resolution and the mechanics of introducing it will be
intense. Two Democrats, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Dianne
Feinstein, were shopping a draft that condemned Clinton's actions
as ``shameless, reckless and indefensible.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House would bless that language in a minute, but it is
too soft to attract sufficient Republican support. Bennett and
other Republicans willing to sign on to censure rightly will insist
on language reflecting the reality that Clinton knowingly did lie
under oath and that he did tamper with evidence and witnesses and
attempt to impede the lawful progress of a civil rights suit.
</P>
<P>
   These factors dictate a semantic balancing act. Once the
language is toughened to conform with the facts of presidential
misconduct, a few Democratic loyalists will drop off. But the
stiffer censure, if carefully crafted, will pick up a few extra
Republicans beyond those needed for a minimal bipartisan majority
of 45 Democrats and six Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Lott is searching for a parliamentary map as well. Moynihan has
suggested an adjournment in the trial early next week. During that
break the Senate would go into legislative session to pass a
censure resolution. With that on the record, the Senate would then
go back into trial session and vote down the articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario may be too complicated, but the Senate is at the
point where two powerful political desires are driving its members
toward devising some sort of exit plan.
</P>
<P>
   They want the trial to end swiftly without removal of the
president. Moreover, most Democrats, looking to their own futures,
want to go on record as condemning Clinton. But they will have to
do business with the Republicans, who are right on a key point.
Clinton did not simply misbehave. He committed serious offenses
that, while not rising to the level of removable high crimes, must
be permanently recorded as base and calculated offenses against the
rule of law.

BESIEGED U.N. COMMISSION CHIEF WILL NOT SEEK ANOTHER TERM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Richard Butler, the embattled chairman of the
commission charged with disarming Iraq of weapons of mass
destruction, said Thursday that he did not expect to seek another
term as chairman but that he would strongly resist any effort to
oust him.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Butler coupled his intention to leave
when his contract expires in June with strong criticism of Russia,
a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative, has led a fierce
campaign against Butler and his commission, calling almost daily
for his resignation or dismissal on grounds that he is
unprofessional, untrustworthy, biased and impolite.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Russia's attacks on his integrity, Butler grew
combative. Moscow, he said, was trying to divert attention from
Iraq's violations of its disarmament commitments and repeated
efforts to conceal information and material from weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior diplomats are asking: What is going on here?'' Butler
said. ``Are the Russians really asking us to believe that if
Richard Butler went under the guillotine tomorrow, that everything
would be hunky-dory in Baghdad and Iraq? Are the Russians really
asking serious women and men to believe that?''
</P>
<P>
   Butler stressed that the true issue was whether Iraq would
comply with U.N. resolutions and the pledges it made as a condition
of the Gulf War cease-fire in 1991. He is primarily concerned, he
said, that Unscom, as the United Nations commission is known,
return to Iraq to judge whether Iraq is developing nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Tension within the security council over both Butler's and
UNSCOM's fate has been building since Butler filed a report in
December concluding that Iraq was violating its pledge to Secretary
General Kofi Annan to permit unrestricted inspections. The report
triggered U.S. and British air strikes and inspections were
suspended.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Russia, France and China, all permanent
security council members, have been lobbying to remove economic
sanctions on Iraq. The United States has become increasingly
isolated both in its support for Butler and in its main priority,
the insistence that sanctions be maintained until the special
commission certifies that Iraq has disarmed.
</P>
<P>
   The security council agreed Saturday to set up three panels to
evaluate its relationship with Iraq. The United States, Britain and
Butler have insisted that UNSCOM's experts be part of the panel on
disarmament. But Russia and Iraq have refused to work with Butler,
or to accept special commission documents as long as he is
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials Thursday seemed intent on countering a growing
impression among diplomats here that U.S. support for Butler and
the commission is weakening. James Foley, the State Department's
deputy spokesman, said that Washington ``supports Butler fully and
thinks he's done a splendid job as chairman.'' The decision about
his future, Foley added, ``is his, and his alone to make.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Foley stressed that Washington would continue its air strikes
against Iraq rather than permit Butler's many critics to dilute the
commission's authority and create what he called a ``Potemkin
UNSCOM.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Burleigh, the U.S. representative, called Butler and his
commission ``heroes,'' adding that Washington is ``very glad that
Unscom will be actively participating in the disarmament panel.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler said it would be tragic if any future disarmament system
failed to use the expertise of the special commission's inspectors
on Iraq's nuclear, germ and chemical weapons. The commission,
established by the security council in 1991, has a core group of
experts who have been studying Baghdad's weapons programs for the
past eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Celso Amorim, the Brazilian representative on the council who
will head all three panels, has not yet selected the members. But
diplomats here said they understand that while neither Butler nor
the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, a U.N. agency
monitoring Iraqi compliance on nuclear weapons, would be panel
members, the group would include experts and commissioners from the
special commission.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said that he had informed Annan Thursday at a meeting at
his request that ``my present intention is not to ask for an
extension.'' But he also rejected the criticism of his performance
and Russian calls for his resignation or dismissal, saying that his
removal would imply that he or the special commission had ``done
something wrong, which is absolute nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there were some move to arbitrarily dismiss me, I would be
very resistant to this,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Butler, an Australian, said that after 30
years in arms control, his main concern was the disarming of Iraq,
and that if new management would help accomplish this when his term
ends, he would leave with pride in what he and the commission have
accomplished. ``No one is indispensable,'' he said.

2 TESTS MAY HELP FIGHT DEVELOPMENT OF DRUG RESISTANCE IN AIDS
VIRUS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Two new laboratory tests promise to improve therapy
for individuals with drug-resistant strains of the AIDS virus and
to reduce the risk that the virus will develop resistance in others
who are newly infected, researchers said at the close of a five-day
AIDS meeting here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Drug resistance has become a critical factor in the failure of
potent drug cocktails in many individuals infected with HIV, the
AIDS virus. Studies have shown that resistance can result when
individuals do not adhere to prescribed regimens, allowing the
virus to change and become resistant to the medication. Other cases
result when an individual infected with a resistant virus transmits
it to another person.
</P>
<P>
   HIV can develop resistance to any of the marketed drugs, and
over time the virus can develop cross-resistance to all members of
the three main classes of anti-HIV drugs: nucleosides,
non-nucleosides and protease inhibitors. By identifying genetic and
other markers in the virus that indicate drug resistance, doctors
hope to use one or both of the tests to match more precisely the
drugs prescribed with the virus strain identified in the patient.
</P>
<P>
   Drug resistance is estimated to affect only a small percentage
of infected individuals now, said Dr. John W. Mellors of the
University of Pittsburgh. But he said health officials were
concerned that further spread could increase the problem of
resistance and wipe out some gains made in AIDS therapy in the last
three years.
</P>
<P>
   One new method, genotype testing, pinpoints genetic mutations in
HIV. The second method, phenotype testing, determines the degree of
susceptibility or resistance of HIV when it is grown in a test tube
after the addition of selected drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The tests have different limitations and the findings need to be
interpreted carefully. Genotyping is easier to perform and costs
$200 to $400 a test, as against a cost of $700 to $1,000 for
phenotyping. Because phenotyping is done in test tubes, the
findings may not necessarily predict what happens in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have been using both tests in many research studies,
and many doctors now use them in prescribing drugs for some
patients. But wider application of the tests to routine patient
care is still about a year away for a number of reasons,
participants at the Sixth Conference on Retroviruses and
Opportunistic Infections said.
</P>
<P>
   Much needs to be learned about precisely when and how often
either or both tests should be used in patient care. ``We are still
in infancy in understanding the relationship'' between test
findings and therapeutic success, Mellors said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts have begun drafting the first recommendations for the
tests, and they are expected to be issued as early as this summer,
Dr. Robert T. Schooley, a meeting official, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions that scientists need to answer are these:
Which, if any, of the tests should be used when anti-HIV drugs are
first prescribed? Should the tests be used only when drugs begin to
fail?
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies are now showing that experts have been wrong
in some of their earlier practices in treating drug resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Mellors said scientists had assumed that when a patient was
taking a combination of drugs and it failed, the virus had
developed resistance to all drugs in the combination. ``We now know
that that is not the case,'' Mellors said. ``Usually one drug in
the combination fails, and which one depends on which drugs are in
the combination.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectation is that with findings from the tests, doctors
can now focus on changing the resistant drug, not the entire
combination. However, people at the conference cautioned that
studies are needed to document that such an approach will work.

   Precise figures on the frequency of HIV drug resistance are
lacking because there is no national tracking system. Experts can
make estimates only from small studies.
</P>
<P>
   Mellors cited two studies looking at the frequency of resistant
virus among individuals who were infected within the past two
years. About 3 percent of newly infected individuals had HIV
resistance to the anti-HIV drugs belonging to the nucleoside group,
from 5 to 15 percent had resistance to the non-nucleoside drugs,
and from 1 to 10 percent had resistance to the protease inhibitor
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance figures for the protease inhibitors is lower because
they were generally marketed latest, giving them less time to
develop resistance, Mellors said. In recent years, doctors have
used a test that measures the viral load, or number of AIDS viruses
in the blood, to guide drug therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Genotyping helped improve the short-term therapeutic success in
a study carried out in several hospitals that Dr. John D. Baxter of
Cooper Hospital/University Medical Center in Camden, N.J., reported
here on Thursday. The study included 153 patients whose viral load
rose after 16 weeks of treatment with drug cocktails, indicating
that the drugs were failing.
</P>
<P>
   The patients agreed to be divided into two groups. In one group,
the study leaders told the patients' doctors about the findings of
the genotype tests and advised them on the drug regimen. In the
other group, the doctors were not informed of the genotype
findings. After three months, more members of the group that
received expert advice had less HIV in the blood than did members
of the group that did not receive such advice.
</P>
<P>
   The time period is far too short to draw firm conclusions about
the effectiveness of using drug resistance tests to reduce the
guesswork in prescribing anti-HIV drugs, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, the
federal agency that is responsible for tracking HIV, is using
genotyping as it begins to develop a national surveillance system
for the incidence of HIV drug resistance. The monitoring is similar
to the centers' efforts to track drug-resistant strains of
gonorrhea, another sexually transmitted disease, Dr. Harold W.
Jaffe, a CDC official, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   With time, the agency intends to use both genotyping and
phenotyping with the aim of detecting trends in resistance and
determining which populations are most affected, Jaffe said. The
information will then be used to make treatment guidelines, as in
gonorrhea and tuberculosis.

BAFFERT THREE-PEAT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The balance of power among Kentucky Derby
candidates tilts toward California this winter, and the difference
is the heavyweights in trainer Bob Baffert's barns at Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   In stall 15, there's Exploit, dozing through a dull Thursday
morning. In 18, Prime Timber is stretching his neck and snorting at
a visitor. In 25, Forestry is tethered to the back wall.
</P>
<P>
   Across a dirt road, in stall 32, Finder's Gold is glaring at a
passerby, ears pinned against his dark head. In 36, General
Challenge is nuzzling a hay bale, specks of feed on his white face.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely are so many Derby contenders found in one place, even 12
weeks before the May 1 race at Churchill Downs.
</P>
<P>
   But for Baffert, boasting wins in the past two Derbies with
Silver Charm and Real Quiet, the hard part isn't attracting top
3-year-olds, it's plotting prep schedules for all of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only plan I have is to get them to the Derby,'' Baffert
said, half-joking.
</P>
<P>
   The local countdown begins in earnest Saturday when Exploit, No.
1 in most national 3-year-old rankings, starts his season in the
7-furlong San Vicente Stakes, a step toward the April 3 Santa Anita
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Here are our rankings, which might be titled So Many Horses, So
Little Space:
</P>
<P>
   1. Prime Timber: Son of Sultry Song, winner of the 1\-mile
Hollywood Gold Cup in 1992, the Aaron Jones-owned colt ran second
to since-sidelined Tactical Cat in the Hollywood Futurity, which
was the springboard for Real Quiet, A.P. Indy, Best Pal, Alysheba,
Ferdinand and Snow Chief. He's recovered from a heel bruise and
virus and aiming for Santa Anita's San Rafael on Feb. 28.
</P>
<P>
   2. Exploit: Much-hyped after skipping the Breeders' Cup to go 4
for 4 as a 2-year-old _ including stakes wins at Churchill _ for
owners Bob and Beverly Lewis. Some doubt his breeding (Storm Cat)
and style (aggressive) fit 1\ miles. On the other hand, a loss in
the San Vicente, a sprint after a 10-day layoff, shouldn't be held
against him.
</P>
<P>
   3. Cat Thief: Dull third in last week's Hutcheson sprint is
excusable (see Exploit). He'll stay at Gulfstream Park to prep for
the March 13 Florida Derby in the Feb. 20 Fountain of Youth.
</P>
<P>
   4. General Challenge: California-bred from Golden Eagle Farm won
third in a row _ and new respect around the country _ in last
week's Santa Catalina. Baffert has three of our top four.
</P>
<P>
   5. Aly's Alley: Used a Derby-style rally to be second in
Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Churchill for low-profile trainer John
Tammaro. Next: Fountain of Youth.
</P>
<P>
   6. Millions: Laurel Futurity winner was a good second in the
1[-mile Remsen, which produces good 3-year-olds in New York the way
the Hollywood Futurity does here.
</P>
<P>
   7. Vicar: Trained by Carl Nafzger (Unbridled), the son of Wild
Again chased Exploit home in the Kentucky Jockey Club and was a
troubled fifth as the Holy Bull Stakes favorite at Gulfstream.
Next: Fountain of Youth.
</P>
<P>
   8. Worldly Manner: Won Del Mar Futurity for Baffert, then was
sold to Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai, where he'll prep for the Derby
with training races. A Daily Racing Form cartoon showed turbaned
carpenters erecting a Churchill Downs replica in the desert.
Anything's possible when you own a country.
</P>
<P>
   9. Answer Lively: Maligned Breeders' Cup Juvenile winner was a
puzzling seventh at the New Orleans Fair Grounds last week. Don't
panic about early-season results. Real Quiet was eighth in his 1998
debut.
</P>
<P>
   10. The Groom is Red: It wouldn't be Derby season without
trainer Nick Zito. Give Rick Pitino-owned Champagne Stakes winner
one more chance (in the Fountain of Youth) after his allowance-race
loss Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The second 10: 11. Excellent Meeting and 12. Silverbulletday,
the Baffert fillies; 13. Honest Lady, Bobby Frankel's girl; 14.
Finder's Gold, whom Baffert may point for the March 14 Louisiana
Derby; 15. 6-furlong San Miguel winner Cape Canaveral; 16.
early-blooming Belmont Futurity winner Lemon Drop Kid; 17. smart
maiden-breaker Forestry; 18. Chief Minister, who might be Victory
Gallop trainer Elliott Walden's best since Bet Me Best is hurt; 19.
Menifee, another Walden colt; and 20. Certain, 4 for 4 around two
turns in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   20 to follow: Zito's Cryptodiplomacy, Adonis, Doneraile Court
and Wondertross; trainer Ron McAnally's late-starting Crowning
Storm, Domination and Apremont; Blue Tune and Epic Honor, second
and first for trainer Jeff Bonde in Golden Gate Derby; Holy Bull
winner Grits'n Hard Toast, winner of the Smoke Glacken Award for
worst name; Norfolk winner Buck Trout; Lecomte upsetter Some Actor
and runner-up Desert Demon; Remsen winner Comeonmom, in Dubai with
Worldly Manner; sprint rocket Texas Glitter; Remsen also-ran
Casanova Star; Mountain Range, 13th in the Lecomte; Lisa
Lewis-trained Capsized; and San Vicente entrants Futural and
Aristotle.
</P>
<P>
   To be updated in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   __ The weekend: Exploit's 3-year-old debut in the San Vicente is
only a warmup act on a Santa Anita weekend that features Saturday's
Strub and Sunday's San Antonio Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   The Strub, for 4-year-olds, is Event of the Year's and rider
Corey Nakatani's race to lose now that San Fernando winner Dixie
Dot Com is injured. Dr Fong (Gary Stevens) and Quake (Chris
McCarron) join the troupe.
</P>
<P>
   The Saturday card starts at noon.
</P>
<P>
   The San Antonio opens the 5-year-old campaign of Free House
(McCarron). He was assigned 123 pounds, four to seven more than his
opponents, including Malek (Alex Solis) and possibly Cavonnier
(Stevens).
</P>
<P>
   __ Eddie D. countdown: One reason for the popularity of Eddie
Delahoussaye, who is two wins from becoming the 14th jockey with
6,000, is his sparing use of the whip. Typical was A.P. Indy's 1992
Breeders' Cup Classic victory. Delahoussaye never struck the colt.
</P>
<P>
   He recalled recently: ``Everybody said, `Why didn't you hit him?
It's a $3 million race!' I said, `Why'd I want to hit him? He's
running!' Simple as that.'' &QL; 
A WEEK AT THE RACES
</P>
<P>
   __ Santa Anita leaders: Jockeys (through Wednesday): Alex Solis,
33 wins; David Flores, 25; Gary Stevens, 21, Chris McCarron, 19;
Kent Desormeaux and Laffit Pincay, 18. Trainers: Bob Baffert, 13;
Bobby Frankel, 10; Ron McAnally, 9; Richard Mandella, 8; Wally
Dollase, 7.
</P>
<P>
   __ Handicapper helper: Post position 1 _ closest to the rail _
is as tricky as ever in Santa Anita sprints, producing only eight
winners so far, just over half its fair share. Horses with early
speed can overcome the disadvantage; five of the eight winners led
gate to wire.
</P>
<P>
   __ On the stakes schedule: At Santa Anita: Saturday, $500,000
Strub Stakes, 4-year-olds, 1[ miles, $150,000 San Vicente,
3-year-olds, 7 furlongs, and $125,000 Pro or Con Handicap,
California-bred fillies and mares 4 and up, 1 mile on turf; Sunday,
$300,000 San Antonio Handicap, 4-year-olds and up, 1[ miles, and
$200,000 La Canada, 4-year-old fillies, 1[ miles. At Gulfstream
Park: Saturday, $$200,000 Gulfstream Park Breeders' Cup Handicap,
3-year-olds and up, 1] miles on turf.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mileposts: Paul Mellon, who died in Virginia on Monday at age
91, was the only owner to win the Kentucky Derby (with Sea Hero,
1993), Epsom Derby and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe (both with Mill
Reef, '71). He owned American horses of the year Fort Marcy ('67)
and Arts and Letters ('69) and was voted the nation's leading owner
and breeder ('72). . . . On his first day riding after 16 months of
weight and personal problems, jockey Chris Antley was disqualified
from second to fourth in a turf race Wednesday at Santa Anita, the
DQ resulting in a three-day suspension. Welcome back. . . .
Wednesday's eighth-race superfecta paid a Santa Anita-record
$130,540.80 for $1. Laffit Pincay swept a $974.80 late double. . .
. Donn Handicap winner Puerto Madero is aiming for the March 28
Dubai World Cup and probably will skip the March 6 Santa Anita
Handicap, second stop in the NTRA's 11-race series for older
horses. Missing the Big 'Cap would cost owners R.D. Hubbard and
Dwight Sutherland a shot at a $5 million bonus for sweeping the
series' five major races. Silver Charm, third as the Donn favorite,
is shooting for the Big 'Cap. . . . Free House trainer Paco
Gonzalez, 53, broke a collarbone when he was thrown while galloping
another horse Wednesday at Hollywood Park. . . . American
racetracks paid a record $978.3 million in purses in '98, up 6
percent from '97, the fifth increase in a row, the Jockey Club
announced. Wagering set a record at $13.6 billion, of which a
whopping 81 percent was bet off-track. . . . And the beat goes on:
Santa Anita has agreed to send its races out over the Youbet.com
interactive computer wagering system. . . . Ariel Smith, the
16-year-old apprentice who made nary a dent here, is third in the
Aqueduct standings behind Aaron Gryder and Rene Douglas. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of New York: New York Gov. George Pataki proposes to
raise the takeout on non-win-place-show bets from 25 to 27 percent.
Throw the bum out!. . . . Gulfstream Park jockey Jocy Gomez was
suspended 15 days for concealing extra weight in her clothes for
prerace weigh-ins and then removing it before races; her horses
would carry about two pounds less than their assignment. Gomez
denied it. Whatever she did, it wasn't working, because she'd
ridden two winners at the month-old meet. . . . Jockeys' win
percentages rarely tell the whole story: Corey Black (18.6 percent)
started the week at Santa Anita 11 for 43 in sprints, 0 for 16 at 1
mile and up, and 0 for 12 on turf. . . . Canterbury Downs in
Minnesota will host the first Claiming Crown Aug. 7 _ a six-race,
$560,000, Breeders' Cup-style program for claiming horses. Nice
idea, some caviar for the horse world's blue-collar workers. . . .
Harness driver Rick Kuebler began the week at Los Alamitos eight
wins from 3,000.

   RAMBOUILLET, France _ The former royal French hunting castle
where peace negotiations on Kosovo are to start Saturday is a world
away from Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where
similar talks led to an uneasy peace for Bosnia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton bristled with intimidating U.S. military might and
technological prowess. Rambouillet, whose inhabitants call
themselves Rambolitains, is a backwater tourist attraction
subsisting on past glory. The cozy 18th-century brick castle
attached to a 14th-century stone dungeon tower lies at the edge of
town, about 30 miles south of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine and British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, the co-chairmen of the talks, will formally
open the negotiations Saturday afternoon. The tall iron gates will
then be closed, French officials say, leaving the Serbian, ethnic
Albanian and international negotiators inside to talk, eat and
sleep in the 30-bedroom castle until they produce an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``The principle is to force the different parties to work out an
agreement, and communication is not the first priority,'' Bernard
Valero, a French Foreign Ministry official, said, indicating that
blow-by-blow accounts would come from the participants, if at all,
not from the organizers.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the negotiators will be cooped up until they produce
an agreement that gives the province, which is 90 percent ethnic
Albanian, some sort of autonomy from Serbia for a three-year
interim period.
</P>
<P>
   They will have no more than two weeks from Saturday to agree,
and if they do, Britain, France, the United States, Germany and
other countries are expected to send in 20,000 to 30,000 troops to
keep the peace. If there is no agreement, NATO warplanes could
attack Serbian military targets, unless the Albanian side is the
main obstacle to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Isolation, or at least as much as is possible in the age of
portable phones, and the ever present pressure of possible military
intervention were the keys to success in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   But then as now, the real key to peace was held by Slobodan
Milosevic, the leader of the side whose brutal attacks against
civilians finally made the international community ready to use
military force.
</P>
<P>
   And though Milosevic went to Dayton, he is not expected to come
to Rambouillet, but instead to send a delegation led by a deputy,
Milan Milutinovic. Milutinovic told the chief U.S. negotiator in
the Dayton talks, Richard Holbrooke, in 1995 that he would have no
authority or flexibility in any talks on Bosnia because, he said,
``the Master,'' meaning Milosevic, ``will pull all the strings.''
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, whose relationship with all the protagonists and
whose connections with the Clinton administration were crucial to
success at Dayton, will not be in Rambouillet either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those considering other Daytons should proceed with caution,''
Holbrooke wrote in his memoir of the Bosnia talks, ``To End a
War,'' published last year by Random House.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a high-wire act without a safety net,'' he went on.
``Much work must precede the plunge into such an all-or-nothing
environment. The site must be just right. The goals must be clearly
defined. A single host nation must be in firm control, but it is
high risk for the host, whose prestige is on the line. The
consequences of failure are great.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Holbrooke said he would be in daily
telephone contact with the lead mediator in the Rambouillet talks,
Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, who was also
Holbrooke's chief deputy in the Dayton negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has developed the kind of relationship with Serbian and
Kosovo Albanian representatives that he and Holbrooke had with
Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian leaders in Dayton.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Hill who, with a European Union negotiator, Wolfgang
Petritsch, developed the framework for the negotiations that Cook
presented to both sides last weekend, along with an ultimatum for
the Serbs to appear at the talks or face NATO bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all going to come down to Chris, who's been designated
the Contact Group negotiator, not the American one,'' Holbrooke
said, referring to the six-nation group _ the United States,
France, Britain, Italy, Germany and Russia _ that called the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the chances are greater than 50-50 for an acceptable
outcome,'' Holbrooke said. ``The key to the whole thing is a
permitted entry into Yugoslavia by NATO ground troops, and the
allies will be there if we're there.''

which she won the Pulitzer, ``How I Learned to Drive,'' about the
incestuous relationship between a girl and her uncle, had a
successful run Off Broadway and was the most produced new play in
America last year, with 26 regional productions. (Sara Krulwich/New

`MEXICAN MA FIA' ATTEMPTS TO KILL ARIZONA PRISON DIRECTOR
DESCRIBED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ In a matter-of-fact voice, a former ``lieutenant'' in
the New Mexican Mafia described how he and another member twice
attempted to kill the state prisons director, Terry Stewart, at his
favorite lunchtime hangout.
</P>
<P>
   He and another member of the gang, John Alday, were given the
responsibility of staking out the Oaxaca Mexican restaurant near
the state Capitol to wait for Stewart, he said in Maricopa County
Superior Court on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They also were given the job of killing Stewart once he went
inside and sat down for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gonna shoot him twice first, then John was gonna shoot
him twice to make sure he was dead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now an informant for police and prosecutors, the witness
detailed how several members _ with nicknames like Cool Cat, Ne Ne,
Bam Bam, Joker and Chino _ plotted to kill Stewart. Three men were
arrested in the scheme: Alday, Michael Garcia and Raymond Llamas.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary hearing started Thursday before Judge Gregory
Martin. Martin will hear testimony from witnesses to determine
whether there is probable cause to bind the three over for trial.
</P>
<P>
   The informant's testimony revealed some of the inner workings
and cold-bloodedness of the prison gang that began in Arizona's
penal system.
</P>
<P>
   At 23 years old, he was driving a brand new Lexus he bought with
the money he made ``working the streets'' for the gang. In order to
become a member, he said he had to stab someone.
</P>
<P>
   But his position and standing in the gang dissolved when he
refused to reveal the location of a friend targeted for murder. He
was stabbed 22 times for his betrayal. That's when he agreed to
testify for the state against the three defendants. Now, a
contract, or ``green light,'' is out on his life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The gang's reason for wanting to kill Stewart? To force prison
officials to back down on policies that are hampering the gang's
illicit activities, he said. In particular, the gang is angered by
new policies that isolate New Mexican Mafia members, making it
difficult to carry out business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Gang members also wanted to send a message that their power
extends beyond the razor wire into the streets, said the informant,
who is not being named for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was gonna be our way to show, `We're out here now,' '' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Stewart's death did not result in changes, gang members
discussed killing prison guards next, he said. They even considered
videotaping the murder of a guard.
</P>
<P>
   There were several meetings to discuss how Stewart would be
killed, he said. Garcia, 37, and Llamas, 32, officers within the
gang, ``called the shots,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he and Alday, 27, were to carry out the actual
killing.
</P>
<P>
   Revolvers were their gun of choice so no shell casings would
leave a trail in the restaurant. After the shooting, each man would
still have four bullets in his gun ``in case somebody tried to play
hero in the restaurant,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They attempted two times to carry out their orders. The first
time, they were seated just a few feet away from Stewart in the
restaurant. But there were too many police eating there that day.
Instead, they ate lunch with their guns tucked in their waistbands,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   On their second attempt, they again were seated just feet from
Stewart. After water and chips were served, the informant said he
started to reach for his gun when two policemen walked in.
</P>
<P>
   The two assassins ended up just eating lunch again.
</P>
<P>
   Officers in the organization decided to put the murder on hold
for a few months to come up with a better plan.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, authorities learned of the murder plot and the
three men were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who was in court Thursday, said the informant's
nonchalant manner as he testified was ``chilling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one thing to have someone come to you and brief you,''
Stewart said. ``Let me tell you, it truly has a chilling effect
when you see someone talk about how he was going to kill the
director.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors and police say the informant and others who plotted
the killing are members of the New Mexican Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   But the informant testified in court that there is no such
organization, a surprise to prison officials. The informant said
there is only the Mexican Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony about the inner workings of the gang will be
considered ``breaking faith'' or violating the ``code of silence''
among members, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The preliminary hearing will continue Monday and is expected to
last three to five days. &QL;

MEXICO ANNOUNCES `TOTAL WAR' ON NARCOTICS
</HEADLINE>
  (bl)  
By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico's four top security officials jointly
announced Thursday what they called a new anti-narcotics strategy,
based largely on the introduction of radar and other technology.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Francisco Labastida Ochoa, who made the
announcement with the secretaries of defense and navy and the
attorney general, said Mexico would spend $400 million to $500
million over three years to buy new planes, ships, radar and other
military and law enforcement equipment. He said $160 million for
anti-drug equipment was included in this year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new spending, the strategy involves pledges
to coordinate Mexico's law enforcement agencies and combat
corruption more efficiently. Labastida called it ``a total war
against drug trafficking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most ambitious anti-drug effort that has ever been
undertaken by our country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The rare joint public appearance by the four officials in an
auditorium at the Interior Ministry and their somewhat extravagant
description of the initiative suggested it might have been timed to
influence U.S. officials three weeks before the Clinton
administration must certify whether Mexico is a reliable partner in
the narcotics war.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were not allowed to ask questions after the officials'
speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Marco Provencio, a spokesman for the Treasury Ministry, said
last year that Mexico spent about $1 billion annually for all of
its anti-narcotics operations and purchases, about 1.4 percent of
its total federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, the $160 million in new spending for anti-drug
equipment appeared to represent a significant increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very big financial commitment,'' a U.S. official
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Enrique Cervantes Aguirre, the defense minister, said
Mexico would acquire a new fleet of aircraft equipped with radar
and infrared cameras to track suspected drug planes.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, U.S. radar aircraft been given intermittent
permission to track drug planes over Mexican territory, and the
acquisition of new radar aircraft suggests a desire to operate more
independently.
</P>
<P>
   Other projected acquisitions include ships equipped to support
dozens of high-speed patrol boats for maritime interdiction,
amphibious craft to protect coastlines, and new helicopters.
</P>
<P>
   The most useful new equipment, a U.S. official said, may be
trucks equipped with large-scale radar for deployment at the border
or along strategic highways to conduct electronic searches of cargo
trailers.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's new emphasis on anti-drug technology is likely to
arouse a debate here that is already under way in the United
States. The White House's director of drug policy, Barry McCaffrey,
has endorsed using high-technology equipment. Other law enforcement
officials believe that traditional techniques like infiltrating
informants into drug-smuggling organizations are far more
cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   The new initiative comes as law enforcement agents here have
appeared increasingly overwhelmed by the country's powerful
traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   In an incident Wednesday that underlined the traffickers'
growing audacity, men firing AK-47 rifles ambushed a group of
federal agents just outside the Mexico City headquarters of the
Federal Judicial Police, killing two officers and wounding three
civilians. Several U.S. drug agents had visited the building hours
earlier.

POLICE EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS ON IMPEACHMENT TRIAL _ INDIRECTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIE AMPARANO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Even through the bulletproof glass in the police
station lobby, the disgust is visible.
</P>
<P>
   The officer on duty shifts from one foot to the other, rests his
hand on his holster, then offers a smirk when asked for his opinion
about President Clinton and the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not allowed to discuss politics,'' he explains. ``It's
against policy.''
</P>
<P>
   I tell him I had come to Phoenix police headquarters downtown
this morning to talk to officers and get their views on the
Washington scandal. Do they approve of how the law is being
handled? What do they think of Clinton? He is, after all, the
nation's top cop.
</P>
<P>
   My last statement makes the officer feign sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh please,'' he bellows, unable to resist the remark. ``I
think you can tell from my gestures what I think of President
Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   The three other officers working on the desk behind him snicker
and shake their heads.
</P>
<P>
   I can read between the lines.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the police station, officers stream in and out of the
building. Some have finished their shifts and are heading home or
to the gym. Others are just starting the day.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a ledge beyond the doors, I stop many and ask them to
tell me about Clinton. Some decline. But others are eager to give
their views.
</P>
<P>
   This 12-year veteran is angry about it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get me started,'' he says. ``First, let's take a look at
the president's actions. He lied under oath. Next, he obstructed
justice. He is supposed to be an enforcer of the law. He is
supposed to set an example.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer then talks about how each day he puts his life on
the line for the law. And for what?
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the president of the United States doesn't respect the
law,'' he says. With that, he is off.
</P>
<P>
   Another police officer wants to talk about the trial and the
lawmakers. But she doesn't feel right talking in front of the
station. So I walk around the block with her.
</P>
<P>
   She's been on the police force for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics has gotten in the way. This isn't being taken
seriously,'' she complains. ``This is about the Democrats vs. the
Republicans. It's not about finding the truth or justice. That's
what gets me, because that's my entire job.''
</P>
<P>
   Another policeman, a veteran of 20 years, wants to focus on the
money being spent on the Clinton mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what? For a slap on his hand?'' he asks. ``We need more
cops on the streets. We need money for so much more. Can't they
see? They're just so out of touch.''
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton's impeachment trial progresses, Julie
Amparano is taking the pulse of people in the Valley. Do they care
about the trial? Do they want him removed from office? What does
captivate Americans? She looks for the answers. Amparano can be

QUAYLE PICKS UP BACKING OF REP. SALMON IN ARIZONA FOR PRESIDENTIAL
BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Former vice president Dan Quayle began his
presidential campaign in Arizona by picking up a potent endorsement
Thursday maverick GOP Rep. Matt Salmon of Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake about it. I am going to do it I am running for
president,'' the former vice president said during a Phoenix news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle and his wife, Marilyn, appeared before a small group of
supporters with Salmon and his wife, Nancy, signaling Quayle's
first major endorsement in the state's Republican Party hierarchy
and a significant split from Arizona's other presidential aspirant,
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon introduced Quayle as a ``personal friend and a great
American'' at an event that was intended to announce the start of
Quayle's presidential exploratory committee. Quayle made a similar
announcement the day before in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   The news conference, though, was merely a formality in Quayle's
carefully orchestrated plan to launch his bid for the 2000 GOP
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Quayle said he plans to begin campaigning
full-time next week, traveling to key early primary states of Iowa
and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm there . . . I'm running for president,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said he is trying for an early win to build momentum and
credibility among GOP voters before California's do-or-die March 7
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to win before you get to California. You've got to
win early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle plans to base his campaign in his adopted home town of
Phoenix, where he spent much of his childhood years and where his
campaign headquarters are located.
</P>
<P>
   He plans a formal kick-off in April in Indiana and Phoenix,
trying to attract additional attention as he enters an increasingly
crowded GOP field.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, the spotlight will be on his contest with McCain,
who earlier this week told reporters, ``I can beat anybody'' in the
state's presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle said he had no comment on McCain's remark, but said,
``We'll do very well here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got deep Arizona roots,'' he said, who attended public
elementary and secondary schools in the Phoenix area. He has his
wife returned to Arizona in 1996, and now live in Paradise Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of friends in Arizona,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle also indicated he is staying out of the debate over when
to stage Arizona's primary, saying the decison was up to the
Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   After he first announced his intentions to run two weeks ago in
CNN's Larry King Live program, many Republicans indicated they
wanted to support Quayle but were unsure whether he could shed the
baggage he accumulated as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Quayle said he is prepared to dispel any lingering
doubts about his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   His appeal will become apparent on the campaign trail, Quayle
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they list to me and read and hear my message, slowly and
surely, we will win them over,'' he said. ``When they see me,
they're going to say this is different.''
</P>
<P>
   In his statement, Quayle sounded many familiar themes - strong
family values, middle-class tax cuts, a restoration of a strong
foreign policy and a ``return or respect and credibility to the
Oval office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me be clear - I will be the Republican nominee for
president, and I will beat Al Gore,'' he said.

STUDENT INVESTIGATORS SAVE A MAN ON DEATH ROW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wis., Fla., Texas, Calif.)  By PAM BELLUCK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Last September, David Protess, a journalism professor
at Northwestern University, got a call from the lawyer for Anthony
Porter, a man who had been on death row since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer knew that Protess assigns his journalism students the
task of re-investigating questionable murder convictions and asked
if the class could look into Porter's case. But Porter was
scheduled to be executed on Sept. 25, three days before the
Northwestern class convened for the semester, so Protess had to
turn down the case.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two days before Porter was supposed to be executed for the
murder of a young couple in 1982, he was a granted a stay so a
court could consider his lawyers' motion that Porter, with an IQ of
51, was not mentally competent and should not be put to death.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Protess and his class the time they needed. With the
help of a private investigator, the journalism students and Protess
examined court records, re-enacted the crime and tracked down old
witnesses. What they found suggested that another man had committed
the murders.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, that man, Alstory Simon, gave a videotaped
interview to the private investigator implicating himself in the
murders and apparently exonerating Porter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I knew anything, I just pulled it up and started
shooting,'' Simon, a 48-year-old Milwaukee laborer who used to live
in Chicago, said in the 10-minute videotape. ``I must have close to
busted off about six rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the prosecutor's office has reopened the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a heavy load's been lifted,'' Porter said in jail.
``I just thank God that everything came out all right.''
</P>
<P>
   If Porter, 43, is cleared, he will be the 10th person released
from death row since Illinois reinstated the death penalty in 1977,
second only to Florida, which has had 18 such cases since 1973. His
case would also become another in a spate of crimes here that have
raised questions about police investigations and the airtight
reliability of convictions in death penalty cases.
</P>
<P>
   Protess, whose class had a leading role three years ago in
freeing four men wrongfully convicted of a 1978 gang rape and
double murder in suburban Ford Heights, said he did not believe
Illinois necessarily made more mistakes in death penalty cases.
Rather, he said, the state has aggressive lawyers, journalists and
advocates who are actively engaged in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Porter was convicted of killing Jerry Hillard, 18, and his
girlfriend, Marilyn Green, 19, who were shot to death in Washington
Park on Chicago's South Side on Aug. 15, 1982 after an annual
parade celebrating black culture. Two days after the killings, the
police charged Porter, 27, who was a gang member with a previous
conviction for armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Protess said he accepted the Porter case for his class because
there seemed to be ``evidence of innocence,'' specifically an
assertion by the mother of one of the victims, Offie Green, that
Porter was innocent because she had last seen her daughter leave
for the park with Simon and his wife, Inez Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of these cases there are not the investigative
resources for indigent defendants,'' Protess said. ``My college
students have the time to investigate.''
</P>
<P>
   The students re-enacted the crime, based on the description
given by the prosecution's lead witness, William Taylor. The murder
occurred at night, but they went to Washington Park on a clear day
so they would have ``optimum conditions,'' said Shawn Armbrust, a
21-year-old senior in Protess' class. ``We positioned ourselves
where Taylor was and the murder was supposed to have been and we
couldn't make our faces out in the middle of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Armbrust said they also noticed that Taylor had said the
killer fired the gun with his left hand. Porter is right-handed.
</P>
<P>
   The next step was to interview witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Protess said that he sometimes sent a private investigator along
with the students, ``if the case is going to involve situations
where students are going to go into dangerous neighborhoods and if
I can't always accompany them.'' When the students visit witnesses
by themselves, Protess will ``role-play the interview'' with them
beforehand, ``and, of course, it is never at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor told the Northwestern sleuths that he had seen Porter in
the park but had not seen him shoot anyone and said, in a signed
affidavit, that the police had ``threatened, harassed and
intimidated'' him into pinning the crime on Porter.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the students visited Simon, who denied involvement,
Ms. Armbrust said, but gave the impression that ``he had either
committed the crime or he knew more than he was telling us.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the students tracked down a nephew of Inez Jackson in jail,
who said he had heard Simon confess his guilt. Last Friday, they
found Ms. Jackson in Milwaukee, now estranged from Simon. She told
them Simon had committed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The students, Protess and the private investigator, Paul
Ciolino, videotaped Ms. Jackson's statement and gave the tape to a
CBS news producer. It was broadcast on Wednesday morning,
coincidentally at the same time that Ciolino had decided to visit
Simon and interview him again.
</P>
<P>
   When Simon saw the tape, ``the air just went out of him,'' said
Ciolino, who told Simon: ``You can take an innocent guy off death
row. Stand up and be a man.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon said that he had been a drug dealer at the time and that
that day, he and Hillard argued about money Hillard owed him. He
said Hillard had made a motion as if he was reaching for a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in fear of my life,'' Simon said on tape. He said he did
not intend to shoot Ms. Green.
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Ms. Jackson both said the police at the time had
treated them only as witnesses against Porter, not as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Chicago Police Department, Lauri Sanders,
said Thursday that the department had not seen the taped confession
or Taylor's affidavit alleging harassment and that, until it did,
it had no plans to investigate its conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did our part,'' Ms. Sanders said. ``There was a crime
committed, we investigated, we interviewed people and we filed
charges. That's where our responsibility stops.''

BRAZIL PLEDGES CURBS ON DEBT AND BUDGETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil _ After weeks of uncertainty about the course
Brazil would pursue to stabilize its troubled economy, officials
here reached a revised agreement with the International Monetary
Fund Thursday night, pledging to enforce substantially greater
budget discipline than originally promised and to keep inflation
below 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at the Brazilian Finance Ministry shortly
before he concluded three days of negotiations here, the IMF's
first deputy managing director, Stanley Fischer, said, ``We have
achieved the goals that we had in mind when this visit began, to
set out a good framework for moving ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   The new agreement calls on Brazil to increase the independence
of the central bank, to contain debt at a level below 45.6 percent
of the gross domestic product, and to produce a primary spending
surplus in the range of 3 to 3.5 percent this year _ substantially
greater than the 2.6 percent surplus the original accord promised.
</P>
<P>
   The primary surplus reflects government spending but not
debt-service payments and is considered a barometer of Brazil's
budget discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Pedro Malan also pledged that Brazil would
accelerate privatization of the energy and banking industries, and
said, ``We reiterate our firm commitment to the agenda of
reforms.'' But he said the accord did not call for the
privatization this year of Petrobras, the state oil company, or of
the Banco do Brasil.
</P>
<P>
   The revised agreement was essential for the IMF to release the
second portion of a $41.5 billion standby loan pledged to Brazil in
November, when this vast nation, one of the world's 10 largest
economies and the leader of Latin America, began hemorrhaging
dollar reserves as investors lost confidence in the nation's
solvency.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the country's situation has only worsened. Dollar
reserves sank to $26 billion from $72 billion, with $17 billion
leaving last month alone. Its currency lost approximately 30
percent in value against the dollar. Interest rates are at 39
percent, despite record-level unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF funds that Brazilian officials initially said would be
needed solely for confidence, and would probably never even be
used, now cannot get here fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the original accord, the revised deal counts fighting
inflation as a goal of the IMF-backed stabilization program, an
important point in selling the agreement to the Brazilian Congress
and public. While people here resent IMF-imposed austerity
measures, they will accept almost any sacrifice to avoid a return
to the era of hyperinflation, when double-digit cost increases each
month were a fact of life.
</P>
<P>
   While noting that an increase in prices to compensate for the
currency's devaluation is inevitable, officials said that high
interest rates were necessary to dampen demand and keep inflation
under control.
</P>
<P>
   The revised agreement says keeping inflation under 10 percent a
year would be pursued ``through firm monetary and financial
policies, strong and sustained fiscal adjustment and an intensified
structural reform effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how far Brazilians could expect to see interest rates come
down, Fischer said, ``The critical issue now is to control
inflation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that a technical and negotiating team would probably
remain through the end of next week, going through fiscal accounts,
projections and plans, and would make its recommendations to the
IMF board in ``not more than two weeks, and I hope much less than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The board would then have to vote on releasing further money to
Brazil. Asked whether more than $9 billion could be released,
Fischer said, the fund's team ``will make a decision on how much to
recommend.''
</P>
<P>
   While the original agreement promised the second installment of
aid by the end of February, the revised agreement says it will come
``as soon as possible,'' but allows for that as late as March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Malan sidestepped questions about precisely how Brazil would
achieve a greater primary surplus, and to what extent the
government would rely on further budget cuts or tax increases to
accomplish that.
</P>
<P>
   An austerity budget cut of 8.7 billion reais was passed by the
Brazilian Congress last week, but the government can spend
substantially less than authorized without congressional
involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The only piece of the accord that specifically depends on
Congress is a final vote extending and increasing a tax on
financial transactions, which is to reach Congress at the end of
March.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators Thursday, however, seemed ill inclined to support
any further austerity measures should the government turn to them
to raise taxes more. Tens of thousands of civil servants are
expected to lose their jobs this year as mandated layoffs take
effect, and members of Congress appear to be distancing themselves
from the president and his austerity measures.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson Kapaz, a lawmaker from President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso's Brazilian Social Democracy Party, said that because of
the financial transaction tax increase, ``we cannot raise taxes any
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Congress allied with the president said,
however, that Brazil could simplify the tax system, which
contributes to rampant evasion and corruption. Kapaz noted that
only 20 percent of companies, for example, are up to date on their
tax payments.

 &HT;    Gray areas exist for new drug agency
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Looking out at a roomful of sports
leaders and politicians, International Olympic Committee President
Juan Antonio Samaranch declared a ``great victory for clean
sports'' Thursday as he closed the World Conference on Doping in
Sport.
</P>
<P>
   But after three days of speeches and sound bites, the only
significant consensus reached by delegates to the IOC-led
conference was agreement to go forward with plans for an
international doping agency.
</P>
<P>
   A declaration by the delegates calls for a working committee to
be in place by May to establish the framework for the drug agency,
which Samaranch has promised will be in use by the Sydney Olympics
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC pledged to raise $25 million to help set up the agency,
most of which is to be budgeted for out-of-competition testing and
to fund research aimed at detecting performance-enhancing
substances. Ultimately, the agency will be run by a director and an
executive council with representation from the IOC, international
sports federations and the scientific community. Names tossed about
Thursday as a possible chair ranged from diplomats in the mold of
Henry Kissinger to retired Nobel Prize scientists.
</P>
<P>
   If the conference ended in victory, it was a bitter one for
Samaranch, with questions about his leadership of the IOC filtering
into the debate on doping. Sports leaders, politicians and athletes
repeatedly called for the agency to be independent of the IOC and
rejected a proposal that he head it.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates also rebuked his liberal interpretation of doping,
approving a resolution that defines it as the use of substances
``potentially dangerous to athletes' health and/or capable of
enhancing their performances.'' After the doping scandal at the
Tour de France last summer, Samaranch suggested that banned
substances not known to damage an athlete's health should not be
prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch did lead the move away from a firm two-year suspension
for a serious first offense, a shift from the IOC's stance before
the Atlanta Olympics. Both the United States and the 15-member
European Union opposed the weaker version, which will allow a
two-year ban to be modified for ``exceptional circumstances.'' That
gives federations opposed to the blanket ban, such as soccer and
tennis, the possibility of seeking lighter penalties for drug
infractions.
</P>
<P>
   Primo Nebiolo, head of the track and field federation, said he
thinks federations will feel pressure not to grant too many
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best (resolution) for the benefit of sport and the
Olympic movement,'' Samaranch said. ``It kept the Olympic movement
united.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch denied that the IOC retreated in the face of
opposition, saying he wasn't surprised by the criticism voiced by
government leaders during the conference. But it was clear a nerve
had been touched by the words of Gen. Barry McCaffrey, the White
House drug czar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We listened with a lot of attention to Gen. McCarthy,''
Samaranch said with a smile, pausing as laughter filled the
conference room. ''We are very thankful he is so interested in the
IOC. We told him he has many problems in his own country regarding
doping.''

 &HT;    ACC recruting breakdown
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   CLEMSON
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: New Tigers coach Tommy Bowden didn't make as big an
impact as expected, but the class is solid. Clemson allowed too
many players to leave the state, including offensive lineman Kevin
Breedlove, who went to Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Quarterback Willie Simmons of Quincy, Fla., was
among the South's best and turned down Georgia Tech and Florida to
sign with Bowden. He fills an immediate need.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Defensive lineman Marcus Lewis of Dunwoody wasn't
on any lists last fall, but he attracted interest from Miami before
choosing Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   DUKE
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Former Florida assistant Carl Franks got a late
start but still managed to sign 17 prospects. Franks was one of the
Gators' top recruiters, so he should make a future impact.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Nick Brzezinski of Ivonia, Mich., was among the top
tight ends in the Midwest. He is an excellent blocker and had 29
receptions as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Fullback Alex Wade of Newtown, Pa., is a strong
runner and adequate blocker.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA STATE
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: The Seminoles didn't have a lot of scholarships,
but coach Bobby Bowden seemed to sign an all-American with every
one. FSU got highly regarded defensive back Rufus Brown and running
back Nick Maddox on signing day.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Defensive end Darnell Dockett of Burtonsville, Md.,
was the top prospect in the Mid-Atlantic. He had 310 tackles and 47
sacks in three years and also was a standout offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Alonzo Jackson of Americus was one of the state's
top defensive line prospects. His future could be on the offensive
line.
</P>
<P>
   MARYLAND
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: The Terrapins' group was considered mediocre at
best before Ron Vanderlinden landed quarterback Latrez Harrison of
Atlanta's Washington High. None of SuperPrep's top-10 prospects
from Maryland signed with the Terrapins.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Harrison seemed headed anywhere but Maryland. But
he backed off his commitment to Auburn only days before the signing
period started.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Most schools were recruiting Eric Dumas of Mays
High to play on the offensive line, but the Terps offered him a
chance to play defense.
</P>
<P>
   NORTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: The Tar Heels put together a solid class for the
second year in a row under coach Carl Torbush. Only seven of UNC's
22 prospects are from the state, but the Heels did particularly
well in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Defensive back Michael Waddell committed to the Tar
Heels early but then seemed to lean toward FSU. He was among the
nation's best, drawing comparisons to Deion Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Defensive lineman Jeb Terry is from a small
military school in Culver, Ind., but Torbush likes his speed and
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   N.C. STATE
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Armed with a new contract and last season's bowl
appearance, Wolfpack coach Mike O'Cain landed his best class in
recent years. N.C. State hit Georgia especially hard, landing five
players from the Peach State.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Defensive back Marcus Ellerbe of Rockingham, N.C.,
committed to North Carolina early but then switched to the
Wolfpack. He had 73 tackles and two interceptions as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Both Georgia and Georgia Tech looked long and
hard at Tony Campbell of Cedar Shoals High in Athens. The Wolfpack
lists him as a wide receiver, but his future might be in the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   VIRGINIA
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: The Cavaliers have one of the ACC's top classes,
but they had to go outside their home state to assemble it. The
Cavs signed just two of SuperPrep's top-10 prospects in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Quarterback Bryson Spinner accounted for 37
touchdowns in his senior season, passing for 1,338 yards and
rushing for 888 more.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Offensive lineman Shomari Chism of Atlanta drew
interest from several big-name schools, including Georgia Tech. If
he improves his footwork, he could develop into a starter.
</P>
<P>
   WAKE FOREST
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Demon Deacons coach Jim Caldwell seemed headed
toward a terrible class until he pulled off a shocker, landing
all-America quarterback C.J. Leak of Charlotte. Wake Forest signed
only 10 prospects.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Leak was ranked among the nation's top prospects
and turned down Notre Dame, Penn State, Kansas State and Syracuse
to sign with Wake. He's the foundation of Wake Forest's future.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: The Demon Deacons were the only team to make an
offer to offensive lineman Chad Rebar of Throop, Pa. But Rebar's
size (6-3, 290) gives him the potential to develop into a starter.

 &HT;    Tech fills its needs at most spots
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech's recruiting effort fortified every
position the Jackets went after except tight end. The Yellow
Jackets lost only center Craig Page off the offensive line from
last season, but left guard Noah King, right tackle Jon Carman,
backup left guard Jason Burks and tight end Conrad Andrzejewski
will be seniors this year. So, coach George O'Leary brought in
three offensive linemen in anticipation of the graduations.
</P>
<P>
   Flanker/tailback Charlie Rogers and backup split end Mike
Sheridan are gone, but split ends Dez White and Brett Basquin and
flankers David Powell and Kelly Campbell return. Still, the Jackets
signed three wide receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's backfield has quarterback Joe Hamilton and backup George
Godsey returning, but freshmen Brian Camp and Andy Hall, along with
redshirt freshman Jermaine Crenshaw, give the Jackets five
quarterbacks on scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Running back is well stocked, with sophomore Joe Burns, senior
Phillip Rogers, redshirt sophomore Sean Gregory and fullbacks Ed
Wilder and Virgil Johnson, but O'Leary, saying a team ``can't have
too many running backs,'' signed four more, headed by Sidney Ford
of Lindale and Jermaine Hatch of Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   Tech had quite a few defensive holes and spent the majority of
its scholarships there. The Jackets have four defensive linemen
coming to replace the graduated Jesse Tarplin and Nate Stimson up
front. Delaunta Cameron and Justin Robertson left two holes at
linebacker, and Tech signed three.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive backfield, which was only marginal at best, lost
strong safety Jerry Caldwell and cornerback Jason Bostic. O'Leary
signed five defensive backs, including Jeremy Muyres of Lilburn and
Cory Collins of Egg Harbor, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strengths: The Jackets did well at the skill positions,
bringing in two quarterbacks, four running backs and five defensive
backs. The best of the defenders might be Collins, a 5-foot-11,
175-pounder who perhaps is the best defensive back in the East and
rated as the No. 8 skill athlete in the country by SuperPrep
magazine. Tech also is happy with Camp, the Ohio prep player of the
year, and running backs Ford and William Glover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weaknesses: The Jackets really needed a tight end to help
Andrzejewski and sophomore Russ Matvay. Now O'Leary must take a
look at his roster and see if someone can be moved to the position.
</P>
<P>
   _ One that got away: The Jackets would have loved to have signed
Godsey's brother Gary, a tight end who signed with Notre Dame. Tech
also liked quarterback Willie Simmons of Quincy, Fla., but he chose
Clemson.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can't miss: The Tech staff loves wide receiver Anthony Lawston
of Baltimore. The 6-4, 215-pounder could play several positions.
Collins and Glover and linebacker Recardo Wimbush also are rated
high, and defensive lineman Greg Gathers, Camp and offensive
lineman Raymond Blake also look strong.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleeper: Hatch was at the top of everyone's list entering his
junior year at Catholic High. But he tore up his knee that year and
most teams backed away. After coming back strong his senior year to
rush for 954 yards, catch 30 passes for 461 yards and account for
21 touchdowns, Arkansas, LSU and Miami tried to get back in the
picture, but Hatch signed with Tech.

 &HT;    Analysts rate Longhorns the consensus winner
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Mack Brown has been at Texas for one season, but he
already appears to have put the Longhorns back on the college
football map.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who left North Carolina for Austin, delivered to Texas
the nation's No. 1 recruiting class this week, according to the
three nationally recognized analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns won No. 1 distinction from Bobby Burton of the
National Recruiting Advisor in Texas, Tom Lemming of Prep Football
Report in Illinois and Allen Wallace of SuperPrep in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hook 'em, Horns!'' Burton said. ``Texas simply has the best
group from top to bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   There are few classes better at the top than Texas' group, which
includes four Parade All-Americans and USA Today's national
offensive and defensive players of the year _ quarterback Chris
Simms of Franklin Lakes, N.J., and linebacker Cory Redding of North
Shore, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Simms, the son of former New York Giants quarterback Phil
Simms, had committed to Tennessee before signing with Texas. The
Longhorns also got two players hotly pursued by Georgia _ wide
receiver Bo Scaife of Denver and offensive tackle Alfio Randall of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Also in all three top-10s were Alabama, LSU, Michigan, Notre
Dame, Ohio State, Texas A&AMP;M and UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Lemming ranked Georgia's group of 25 prospects as the nation's
second-best, and Wallace had the Bulldogs 10th and Burton had them
12th.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech's class of 26 players was ranked 16th by SuperPrep.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Newberg of Atlanta-based Border Wars gave Georgia the
SEC's top class, followed by Alabama, LSU, Florida and Tennessee.
Newberg said Florida State had the top group in the ACC, followed
by Clemson, Georgia Tech and North Carolina.

 &HT;    SEC recruiting breakdown
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   ALABAMA
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Crimson Tide coach Mike Dubose has gotten serious
about recruiting, luring recruiting coordinators from Florida State
(Ronnie Cottrell) and Georgia Tech (Lance Thompson) in the past two
years. As a result, Alabama signed its second top-25 class in a
row.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Saleem Rasheed of Birmingham was rated the South's
No. 1 LB prospect by some services. He had 157 tackles and 15 sacks
as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Charles Jones was a standout QB at Burke County
High, but some people think he could be an All-SEC DB or WR.
</P>
<P>
   ARKANSAS
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Houston Nutt followed up his surprising Citrus Bowl
appearance with an outstanding class. The Razorbacks signed seven
of SuperPrep's top 10 signees in the state.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: RB Cedric Cobbs of Little Rock, Ark., was coveted
by Georgia and Texas A&AMP;M, but he chose to stay home. He rushed for
2,043 yards and 15 TDs on 157 carries as a senior.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: WR Sparky Hamilton of Lufkin, Texas, is a big
target and had 100 catches during his prep career. If he receives
an SAT boost, Hamilton could help immediately.
</P>
<P>
   AUBURN
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Not a bad effort for new Tigers coach Tommy
Tuberville, considering his late start. He upgraded Auburn's skill
positions, signing six WRs, two QBs and four RBs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: WR DeAndre Green of Prichard, Ala., was among the
South's best, finishing his career with 210 catches, 2,900 yards
and 43 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Auburn thinks Georgia and Georgia Tech both
overlooked DL Dexter Murphy of LaGrange and WR Detronn Harris of
Westlake.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Gators coach Steve Spurrier addressed his major
needs by signing six LBs and six DL. Florida's group of LBs, which
includes Matt Farrior of Virginia and Byron Hardmon of Florida, is
probably the nation's best.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Sprinter Lito Sheppard of Jacksonville could play
both ways. He is among the nation's best CB prospects and has
big-play ability on offense.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Marshall Schaap of Belleview, Fla., had only 10
catches last year in a run-oriented offense, but he was the top TE
at Florida's summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   KENTUCKY
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Departed QB Tim Couch and coach Hal Mumme's Air
Raid offense allowed the `Cats to take their effort nationally. The
Wildcats signed players from 10 states other than Kentucky,
including seven from Texas.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Derek Smith is considered the best TE from Kentucky
since Frank Jacobs signed with Notre Dame more than a decade ago.
Smith might play basketball at UK, as well.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: WR Ernest Simms of Houston County High didn't
draw a lot of interest because of his height (5-8), but Mumme loves
his 4.3 speed.
</P>
<P>
   LSU
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Tigers coach Gerry DiNardo signed 10 of SuperPrep's
top 15 recruits from Louisiana. The class got better when QB Josh
Booty returned from minor-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Eric Edwards of Monroe, La., was the nation's
top-rated TE and has been compared to former LSU star David
Lafleur.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: WR Chris Davis of Greensburg, La., jumped from
the marching band to football as a senior and finished with 48
catches for 1,054 yards and 10 TDs.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: New Rebels coach David Cutcliffe started too late
to make a real impact, but landing QB Eli Manning of New Orleans
gave the former Tennessee assistant some instant credibility.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Although he wasn't as hyped as older brother
Peyton, Manning was one of the nation's top signal-callers. And,
with Romaro Miller returning, Manning won't be thrown into the fire
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: If Marietta High WR Lee Jackson qualifies, he'll
be a steal for the Rebels. Jackson is big and has soft hands.
</P>
<P>
   MISSISSIPPI STATE
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Not as JUCO-heavy as last year, but Bulldogs coach
Jackie Sherrill still got seven players from the junior-college
ranks. He continued to attract the best players in Mississippi,
beating the Rebels in most head-to-head battles.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Mississippi State surprisingly landed RB Dontae
Walker of Clinton, Miss., early. Walker rushed for 1,880 yards and
33 TDs last year and turned down FSU and Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: Kamau Jackson of Atlanta might have been the
state's top LB last year, but he couldn't play during his senior
season at Washington High because of eligibility problems. If
Jackson qualifies and puts his off-the-field troubles behind, he
could become an All-SEC player.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: First-year coach Lou Holtz had a disappointing
effort. The Gamecocks and Clemson allowed too many players to leave
the state. However, stealing RB Derek Watson of Williamston, S.C.,
from Tennessee on signing day was a big coup.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Watson could have a tough time getting in school,
but if he does, the Gamecocks' running game will get immediate
help.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: RB Ryan Brewer was Mr. Football in Ohio, but his
apparent lack of breakaway speed caused larger programs to shy
away. Holtz landed a hard runner.
</P>
<P>
   TENNESSEE
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: The Volunteers followed their national championship
with a top-20 class, but the group lost a lot when QB Chris Simms
defected to Texas. Tennessee didn't finish particularly well.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: Albert Haynesworth of Hartsville, S.C., was the No.
1 DL prospect in the nation, but a mediocre senior season caused
his stock to drop. Still, Tennessee projects him as the next Reggie
White.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: DE Constantin Ritzmann of Tallahassee is a
foreign-exchange student from Germany who has played only one
season of competitive football. But he's a quick learner _ he had
150 tackles and 25 sacks in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   VANDERBILT
</P>
<P>
   _ The class: Vandy coach Woody Widenhofer continues to address
his offense, as 12 of the Commodores' 19 signees project for that
side of the ball. Vandy signed players from eight states other than
Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   _ The jewel: LB Mike Adam of Hales Corner, Wis., might be
Vandy's most-recruited player. He turned down Iowa, Notre Dame and
Northwestern, but he will battle for playing time at the
Commodores' deepest position.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sleeper: OL Jordan Pettit of Olive Branch, Miss., missed
most of his senior season with a broken hand. Vandy, the only
school to make an offer, believes he will develop into a starting
guard or center.

 &HT;    Dogs overcame coaching losses
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia's 1999 recruiting effort might be as
impressive for what the Bulldogs had to overcome as for what
players they landed.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia was able to put together a top-10 class despite the loss
of two coaches during the height of recruiting, with its
coordinator pursued by another school and while strapped by
NCAA-sanctioned scholarship limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaches and players did a really good job of coming
together, taking up the slack and holding on,'' coach Jim Donnan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving for new jobs in December were longtime Donnan assistants
Chris Scelfo (head coach, Tulane) and Mickey Matthews (defensive
coordinator, Baylor). But potentially the most damaging problem was
Auburn coach Tommy Tuberville's relentless quest to bring
recruiting coordinator Rodney Garner back to his alma mater.
</P>
<P>
   Garner turned down a generous raise and an opportunity to become
the Tigers' assistant head coach and remained with Georgia. But
even after Garner stated publicly that he would remain with the
Bulldogs, rumors persisted through signing day that he would be
bolting for Auburn after recruiting season ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to recruit a young man and then go somewhere
else after I came out in the Atlanta paper and said that I
wasn't,'' Garner said. ``That would hurt my credibility, tear it to
shreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy,'' he said. ``I came to Georgia with one goal in
mind and that's to win a national championship.''_ Strengths: The
class fulfills Georgia's needs. The Bulldogs needed wide receivers
and signed five, including two consensus all-Americans. They needed
help in the kicking game and signed the top two kickers on their
list. They lost senior tight ends Larry Brown and Jermaine Wiggins
and signed two in Robert Brannon and Jason Rader.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weaknesses: Although Donnan insists he's pleased with what he
got, the Bulldogs' top two running back prospects went elsewhere,
and Georgia was unable to persuade any quarterbacks to play behind
Quincy Carter and Nate Hybl.
</P>
<P>
   The number of prospects to enroll next fall could determine the
overall quality of the class. At least seven of those signed
Wednesday have not met the school's entrance standards.
</P>
<P>
   _ One that got away: Much was made of Nick Maddox's last-minute
decision to sign with Florida State rather than the Bulldogs, but
the running back Georgia wanted most stepped out of the picture
Monday. As good as the 5-foot-10, 180-pound Maddox is, Cedric Cobbs
of Little Rock, Ark., was more of what the Bulldogs were looking
for _ a big, strong back (6-1, 217) capable of carrying the ball 30
times a game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Can't miss: Wide receivers Reggie Brown and Durell Robinson
are easy picks here, but all three offensive linemen Georgia landed
have all-star potential. Because the Bulldogs signed five linemen
last year and redshirted others, offensive line was not a priority.
But they made up for quantity with quality, as Josh Billue (6-6,
300) of Guntersville, Ala., Kevin Breedlove (6-5, 295) of Clemson,
S.C., and Alex Jackson (6-5, 310) of Quincy, Fla., were rated the
best at their positions in their respective states.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sleepers: Georgia's coaches think they got a few hidden gems
in linebacker Kendrell Bell, defensive back Kentrell Curry and wide
receiver Damien Gary. Curry, a 6-3, 186-pound defensive back, is a
prototype free safety whose notoriety probably suffered because of
his early November commitment.

 &HT;    Major sports resist curbs
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ In 1988, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson
injected himself with steroids to cope with a hamstring injury and
ran the race of his life at the Seoul Olympics. Caught by
drug-testers, he was forced to hand over his gold medal and was
sentenced to eternal disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, Los Angeles Dodgers slugger Kirk Gibson used a
steroid injection to deal with his own hamstring injury. He struck
a dramatic game-winning home run and was enshrined in World Series
folklore, a sports hero to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Mark McGwire became baseball's season home-run
champion while taking androstenedione, an over-the-counter dietary
supplement that would have gotten him busted at the Olympics. U.S.
shot putter Randy Barnes, gold medalist at the Atlanta Games, was
suspended after testing positive for andro.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in drug acceptance within the separate arenas of
major professional sports and the more amateur-like sports of the
Olympics was at the core of the debate at the World Conference on
Doping in Sport, which ended Thursday. Delegates proposed putting
curbs on performance-enhancing substances while knowing that the
pro stars in the United States and Europe _ often, role models to
youths _ are allowed to use certain drugs and nutritional
supplements away from the Olympic spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   And now that athletes from NBA millionaires to cyclists on the
drug-infested Tour de France circuit are joining the Olympic family
in increasing numbers, the headache won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, such sports as cycling and soccer successfully
fought for a compromise provision in the proposed two-year
suspension for a positive drug test, allowing for the penalty to be
modified for ``exceptional circumstances'' _ such as an American
baseball player using andro.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have this problem if we didn't have professional
sports in the IOC,'' said Roland Baar, a member of the IOC
Athletes' Council and a silver medalst in rowing at the Atlanta
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that the Olympic movement is trapped in its
hypocrisy, that it markets the Games as a pure, innocent sports
event, rather than entertainment like the Super Bowl, while at the
same time sending out invitations to pro athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the comments this week were directed toward U.S. sports.
Dick Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada, said, ``The closer
you are to the Olympic movement, the more you are concerned about
doping. The farther away from it you are, the less you care. All of
a sudden, you are in Mark McGwire land, and this is a national hero
all souped-up.''
</P>
<P>
   Arne Ljungqvist, the Swedish IOC member and the international
track federation's medical director, said, ``To have drugs used by
healthy young people who are supposed to be role models for our
young generation, it is just not (proper). If they accept it in
professional sports in the United States, then it is my advice that
they look at it again. This is against every sort of medical
ethics, to use strong drugs intended for the cure or prevention of
disease on healthy people. You can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olympic athletes have been divided into two groups. Those from
international sports federations who do not compete in professional
leagues face varying degrees of out-of-competition drug testing
year-round and at major events; pro hockey players, baseball
players and others face minimal testing, if any, and are rarely
caught.
</P>
<P>
   The world of athletics has discovered that the public does not
perceive positive drug tests as an effort to clean up a sport as
much as a signal that the sport might be drug-infested.
</P>
<P>
   Who gave a second thought while watching the Super Bowl to how
pharmacology played a role in developing the muscled Falcons and
Broncos? But when an Olympian speeds up the track or down the pool
and breaks a record, suspicions are automatic.
</P>
<P>
   A die-hard faction is holding on to a dream of having the pros
tested like everyone else, of drug-testers showing up unannounced
seeking urine samples from the wealthiest of athletes. If they
flunk, the guilty would be suspended for two years, like everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of IOC members are less worried about the pros and
more concerned about hanging on to what they can of the Olympic
ideal. They argue that testing for performance-enhancing drugs is
more critical in nonteam sports such as track and swimming, where
performance can be quantified and world records assume exalted
status.
</P>
<P>
   ``The opportunity to be an Olympic champion only happens once
every four years,'' said Anita DeFrantz, one of two American
representatives to the IOC. ``The chance to be in the Super Bowl is
annual. The chance to be in NBA playoffs is annual. If the people
involved in professional sports in the United States don't care
about their athletes, that is unfortunate.''

 &HT;    Women drivers making impression
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Fifty-eight drivers completed the first Women's Global
GT Series tryouts last week at Road Atlanta. Another tryout is
scheduled for March 29 for those who couldn't be at the first one.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the tryouts are attempting to qualify for the
series' 16-car fields, and the results have been surprising, WGGT
Series executive director Lyn St. James said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have a larger body of competitive race drivers than
anticipated,'' she said. ``We knew we had race-car drivers, but we
didn't know they'd be this good. I expect we'll clear 40 or 50.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to driving, competitors were given physical and
mental tests by the Human Performance Institute. In one test,
Krista Baker-Barr of Cumming did 502 abdominal crunches, about
three times her nearest competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The drivers are as interesting as they are talented. Jean Kinser
of Carrollton married Adam Malley last year in Victory Lane at
Daytona International Speedway. Malley is a national champion in
the SCCA's ``H'' production series.
</P>
<P>
   Milka Duno of Caracas, Venezuela, has competed five master's
programs _ naval engineering, business organization, marine
business, naval architecture and marine biology _ and she isn't 30
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Final results will be available after the March 29 tryouts.
</P>
<P>
   Sports cars
</P>
<P>
   The teams that were the first two finishers in the Rolex 24 at
Daytona were eclectic. In addition to Riley &AMP; Scott Mark III
regulars _ team-owner Rob Dyson and Butch Leitzinger_- there was
Andy Wallace, a Panoz regular. The second-place Ferrari 333SP is
Atlanta-connected through one of its sponsors, Lease Plan. It is a
similar ride to the one Wayne Taylor and team took to victory in
the first Petite Le Mans at Road Atlanta last year.
</P>
<P>
   Supercross
</P>
<P>
   After winning the first two Supercross events of the year, Ezra
Lusk of Bainbridge has been hampered by bad luck. The latest, in
Round 4 at Seattle, was a first-turn crash involving a number of
bikes. Lusk is fourth in point standings with 65. Mike LaRocco
leads with 82. The tour comes to Atlanta on Feb. 20 at the Georgia
Dome.
</P>
<P>
   F1
</P>
<P>
   Three-time Formula One World Champion Jackie Stewart has played
many roles at Indianapolis Motor Speedway: Rookie of the Year, and
almost overall winner, of the 1966 Indy 500; another strong showing
in the 1967 Indy 500; calling the race on ABC-TV for 15 years; and
driving the pace car in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's coming back as owner of the Stewart-Ford F1 team in the
inaugural United States Grand Prix at Indianapolis' new road course
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   IRL
</P>
<P>
   After a disappointing season debut at Orlando _ 22nd by
defending Pep Boys Indy Racing League champion Kenny Brack, because
of an accident, and a ninth by Billy Boat _ A.J. Foyt Racing has
ordered two new Dallaras.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them both to have new cars for Indy,'' team manager
Tom LaMance said.

ANALYSTS PREDICT LOSS FOR DOLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTLAKE VILLAGE, Calif. -- Bad weather and international
financial turmoil will take a sizeable bite out of Dole Food Co.
Inc.'s profits when it reports fourth quarter results today.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of five brokers surveyed by Boston-based First
Call is that Dole will lose 14 cents a share during the 1998 fourth
quarter, down from 38 cents in the like period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts' estimates have the loss ranging from 8 cents to 15
cents a share, First Call said.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, the Westlake Village company, the world's largest
fresh fruit producer and marketer, is expected to earn $1.84 per
share versus $2.65 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Weak demand as a result of financial upheaval in Asia and Russia
are also expected to have contributed to depressed earnings for
Dole, said Chuck Hill, research director at First Call.
</P>
<P>
   The company tracks 17 big food companies, and the entire sector
has been rocked by international developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings for companies in that index are expected to be down 5
percent. Dole has some problems of its own, but the industry as a
whole is not doing particularly well this quarter,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has already signaled that it would experience turbulence
during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In December, the company said it would take a $100 million
charge during 1998's last quarter to cover costs associated with
damage wrought to its Central American banana plantations and
Honduran beverage operations by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Dole said that it expected a fourth quarter
operating loss of between $3 million to $6 million, or 5 cents to
10 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
   Dole draws more than $200 million a year for distributing and
bottling soft drinks in Honduras for Coca-Cola Co. That operation
and Dole's fruit harvesting operations were shuttered for three
weeks after Hurricane Mitch pounded the area at the end of October.
</P>
<P>
   Dole calculates it will take two years to repair damage to its
plantations.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Dole said an additional $20 million charge would be
necessary after freezing temperatures in late December devastated
citrus crops.

SPORTS COLUMN: RIGHTEOUS IN DEEDS AND WORDS
</HEADLINE>
 (bl) 
By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The National Basketball Association begins its fractured season
Friday night, looking for renewal. But before I can embrace the new
season, I have to bring closure to a pro football season that ended
Sunday with an embarrassing, dull thud.
</P>
<P>
   The National Football League saw its marquee game deflated over
the weekend by an alleged act of misconduct from a player, Eugene
Robinson, who had been considered one of its most upstanding
citizens. By now, everyone knows the story of the Atlanta Falcons'
star safety who was arrested last Saturday night for allegedly
offering an undercover police officer $40 for oral sex in a seamy
area of Miami. The Falcons' Ray Buchanan, repeating a refrain that
has become quite familiar recently, said to a roomful of reporters,
``If anybody in here has never sinned, why don't you raise your
hand and let me know. We all fall short.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course we do. But in a climate where power and affiliation
often determine whose shortfalls become known, the point is that
the person who has the pen has the power. Walter Payton said as
much earlier this week when he held a news conference to reveal
that he had a rare disease that requires a liver transplant.
</P>
<P>
   A few days earlier, Payton had appeared at a news conference
with his son Jarrett, who announced that he will play football at
the University of Miami next year. Walter appeared gaunt and told
reporters that he had lost weight while training for a marathon. A
local Chicago sports anchor said at the time that Payton looked
``all shriveled up'' and that he resembled Mahatma Gandhi. ``I
think I could take him on,'' the anchor had said.
</P>
<P>
   Payton said earlier this week that he felt obliged to make his
illness known. ``Since they have the airwaves,'' he said, referring
to the news media, ``there's no way you can combat that unless you
just come out and tell what's happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Payton episode is reminiscent of Arthur Ashe's public
admission that he had the virus that causes AIDS in 1992. Ashe was
forced to make the disclosure when USA Today told him they had
confirmation and planned to run the story. In each case, Ashe and
Payton were victims _ or casualties _ of the battle to maintain a
media with no restrictions other than those that are self-imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning before the Super Bowl, reporters sat in a room
while Robinson received the 1999 Bart Starr Award from the
Christian group Athletes In Action, which annually honors an
athlete of high moral character. Saturday afternoon, reporters
found themselves engaged in a contentious debate over the fitness
of Lawrence Taylor, with his many off-the-field problems, to be
elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame. By Saturday night we were
all stunned by the news of Robinson's problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the process of lambasting the media for sitting in judgment
of him, Taylor made a crucial point when he said, ``They have no
idea who the hell I am because they get their information from the
media.''
</P>
<P>
   True. We don't know. What bothered me about Robinson, more
rather than less, was the idea of somehow being ``had.'' Of being a
member of the congregation that discovers its preacher is a crook.
Or, perhaps feeling the crude naivete of a customer who buys snake
oil from the medicine man and really expects it to work.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson's act becomes increasingly relevant at a time in sports
when increasing numbers of high-profile athletes say they have
become Christians. They use basketball courts, football fields,
interview rooms and locker rooms to speak about the power of the
Word. They motion toward the sky after every good play. They pray
at midfield and center court after each game. ``Praise God'' and
``Amen'' are as much a part of post-game quotations now as ``I'm
glad we won.''
</P>
<P>
   With the great media scrutiny of athletes, like Robinson, who
lace conversations with beliefs, these men find themselves with an
additional burden of proof, proving that they are more than mere
locker-room Christians. Thursday, Robinson, in Hawaii with his
family for the Pro Bowl, said he refused to shrink. ``The one thing
I don't intend to do is cower and hide,'' he said. ``God made me a
person who really likes and cares about people.''
</P>
<P>
   Fan attraction rests on a delicate balance between an
appreciation for skill, a deep-seated yearning for heroes and
heroines, and a measure of truth and consistency. Coming out of the
Super Bowl and the NBA lockout, the gulf between heroism, truth and
consistency is wider than ever before.
</P>
<P>
   Each side had better work to narrow that gap, before we all fall
in.

 Kinder, Gentler Bank Deal  &HT;       
 By Sam Zuckerman 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
When big banks join forces, massive job cuts usually follow.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key rationales for the wave of mergers that's washed
over the industry has been the hundreds of millions of dollars of
costs banks could wring out by shuttering overlapping operations
and firing excess employees.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Wells Fargo claims it is carrying out a different
kind of bank merger.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the nations's seventh-largest bank, created when
Minneapolis' Norwest bought San Francisco's Wells Fargo and took
its name, insist their eyes are on boosting sales, not slashing
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fundamentally a growth business,'' said President Leslie
Biller, the bank's No.2 executive. The takeover of Wells Fargo ``is
a nonevent in terms of people elimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo is delaying most merger-related job cuts so that
positions can be eliminated by natural attrition rather than
layoffs, Biller said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the purchase took effect in November, the new Wells Fargo
has laid off 492 people out of a workforce of about 100,000. Most
of the cuts took place in Texas and New Mexico, where Norwest and
Wells Fargo both had branch networks and are shutting offices that
serve the same territory.
</P>
<P>
   In the Bay Area, about 25 employees, including eight senior
executives, lost jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead, bank officials said they won't rush to combine
headquarters functions. They will keep two separate human resources
and finance staffs through 2000, when the bank combines computer
systems for those departments.
</P>
<P>
   And Wells Fargo recently launched a formal ``Retain and
Retrain'' program with a full-time staff of three to help employees
who lose jobs find other positions at the bank. Some 1,300
positions are currently listed through the program.
</P>
<P>
   The bank is acting not out of altruism, but as a matter of
business strategy, Biller said.
</P>
<P>
   The old Norwest prided itself for having one of the best records
in banking for selling lots of different products to its customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that our products are better, it's the quality of
execution and that comes down to people,'' noted Biller. ``We think
that's our competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Even suspicious employees said they see signs that the bank
takes its commitment seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Novick's job as a supermarket banking project manager at
the old Wells Fargo's Concord office was eliminated in November.
</P>
<P>
   When she was handed her pink slip, the Walnut Creek resident
also got a pep talk from her boss encouraging her to look for
another job at the bank. A few weeks later, she found a
Concord-based managerial position in the bank's credit and debit
card division.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WELLS05 (105841 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Novick, who saw thousands of staff members lose jobs after Wells
Fargo bought First Interstate three years ago, said she expected
more of the same when Norwest took over.
</P>
<P>
   When the new bank said it wanted to keep employees whose jobs
were cut, ``I, along with a lot of other people, were rather
skeptical,'' Novick recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's concluded, ``they're doing their best to not let
anyone go.''
</P>
<P>
   The bank asked Novick to speak about her experience. Several
other employees, who were contacted privately, said they shared her
views.
</P>
<P>
   While they are eager to speak about programs for displaced
employees, Wells Fargo officials dislike talking about their
job-cutting plans.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo has already announced cuts at call centers and
back-office facilities in locations such as Oregon, Montana,
Nebraska and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Other banks routinely estimate how many positions they expect to
disappear in mergers. North Carolina's NationsBank, for example,
estimated it would lay off 5,000 to 8,000 people following its
purchase of BankAmerica last year.
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo refuses to project job losses. When executives are
asked how many jobs they expect to eliminate, ``they've been very
tight-lipped,'' noted Jay Tejera, a Minneapolis analyst with the
brokerage Dain Rauscher Wessels.
</P>
<P>
   Bank officials say the reason they won't estimate total
merger-related job losses is that they haven't yet decided. ``It's
not as if we have a file in a cabinet somewhere with a secret
number on it,'' said Biller.
</P>
<P>
   But Biller also said he worries about how employees and
communities might interpret screaming headlines about big job cuts.
``We don't want to lead with the wrong message,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, that hasn't been a problem. When Wells Fargo told city
officials that it planned to shut a loan-processing office in Fort
Wayne, Ind., costing 140 jobs, ``they said, `These are our
reasons.' They were very forthright,'' said Beth Neu, Fort Wayne's
economic development director.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said they suspect the bank's managers, especially chief
executive Richard Kovacevich, are torn.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, managers want the bank to be as lean and efficient
as possible. On the other hand, they fear that aggressive
cost-cutting would prove wrenching for employees, eroding the sales
enthusiasm that lies at the core of the bank's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of WELLS05 (105841 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``At the end of the day, (Kovacevich) hasn't figured it out
yet,'' said Carla D'Arista, an analyst with Friedman, Billings,
Ramsey in Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   There are clues where the bank is headed, though.
</P>
<P>
   When Norwest and Wells Fargo unveiled their deal last year, they
said they expected to trim annual expenses by about $650 million
annually, about 8 percent of the two bank's combined expenses. Most
of the savings would come from cutting jobs.
</P>
<P>
   That 8 percent target is modest compared with, say, the 37
percent goal of the old Wells Fargo when it took over First
Interstate. And, after talking with Kovacevich, D'Arista said she
thinks the bank is now setting its sights lower.

 Wow, a Dot.Com Firm That's in the Black  &HT;       
 By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
TMP Worldwide certainly isn't a household name.
</P>
<P>
   And it definitely doesn't have a widely recognizable ticker
symbol (TMPW).
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not nearly as well known as we should be,'' laments TMP
Chief Operating Officer Jim Treacy.
</P>
<P>
   But that could change as fast as you can say, ``dot-com.''
</P>
<P>
   TMP is an Internet play that investors can actually sink their
teeth into. It boasts real businesses that make cold cash,
including an already profitable Internet operation. No joke.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you may now be familiar with TMP's job-finding Web
site,  &LR; Monster.com,  &LR; which just held a huge coming out party during
the recent Super Bowl telecast. The entertaining black-and-white
spots featured little kids musing about what they wanted to do when
they grew up, such as climb the career ladder to a job in middle
management. Or aspire ``to be forced into early retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   The satire-laced point is: The next generation is going to
job-hop like mad. And if TMP has its way, restless employees will
find their jobs by filing their resumes with Monster.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think they're going to manage their careers like we
did, you're crazy,'' says Treacy. ``There's no lifetime employment
at IBM (anymore).''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Monster.com works. Jobseekers keep resumes on file
with Monster.com and tell TMP what they want to do, how much they
want to earn and where they want to live. Then, TMP sells its
service to corporate human resource departments for subscription
fees, matching job openings with resumes in its database.
</P>
<P>
   When certain criteria match, TMP contacts the jobseekers and
asks for permission to release their resumes to the potential
employers. Jobseekers don't pay a dime. Yesterday, Monster.com
stated that it listed more than 175,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com isn't built on profit-projections for the year 2010.
In the third quarter, TMP's Internet business earned operating
profits of $775,000 on $13.3 million in revenues. It may not be
much, but its black ink is flowing in the right direction. Internet
revenues may swell as much as $80 million in 1999, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET05 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Revenues from Internet operations are only expected to account
for about 12 percent of total revenues in 1999, says financial
analyst Brett Manderfeld of Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. He rates
the stock a strong buy, with a price target of $64.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, TMP stock has already enjoyed a huge run. It has
nearly doubled since December, when it was trading under $30 a
share. Yesterday, it closed at $57.75, up $1.75 after Treacy met
with investors at the NationsBanc Montgomery Securities technology
conference.
</P>
<P>
   Still, TMP's earnings per share have grown by about 40 percent a
year over the past three years. And if the Street decides to value
this stock at even a fraction of what it does some less worthy
dot-com stocks, the stock may yet have more gas in its tank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going from $30 (a share) to $55 has been a great move, but
getting from $55 to $85 might be more difficult,'' says Manderfeld,
whose firm does not have an investment banking relationship with
TMP.
</P>
<P>
   So, if Internet operations account for just a fifth of revenues,
what are TMP's traditional businesses?
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, TMP (the acronym stands for telephone marketing
programs) is a classified advertising agency that is morphing into
a job search and placement company.
</P>
<P>
   The company's original and ongoing business is designing and
placing classified advertisements for big employers, such as Sears,
Roebuck and Ryder, in newspapers. And yesterday, TMP announced that
Lucent Technologies and McKesson HBOC are among its newest clients.
</P>
<P>
   TMP is also the world's largest Yellow Pages advertising agency,
meaning it places and designs advertisements for corporations in
thousands of directories worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, perhaps, is that TMP is a headhunter. Its career
services operation fills job slots from interns to CEOs. After
certain acquisitions close, including a buyout of Australia's
Morgan &AMP; Banks, the career search business will generate close to
$275 million a year, Manderfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the economy turns sour and unemployment rises,
TMP's core operations could suffer. That is probably the stock's
biggest downside, analysts and investors say.
</P>
<P>
   What's compelling about TMP's stock is that its Web site is not
the heart of its business model. The Net is a business-to-business
tool that will allow the company to perform many of its traditional
services more efficiently and effectively, notes financial analyst
Steven Horen of NationsBanc Montgomery Securities in San Francisco.
Horen rates TMP a buy with a price target of $70.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1990s, TMP has built its businesses through
acquisition, such as the purchase of Monster.com, and that is
likely to continue, Horen says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to look at their skill as consolidators and their
competency in their core businesses'' to appreciate this stock,''
Horen says. ``Then you might look to the potential of their
Internet business for a pop.''

 FAO Schwarz Patches Hole In Web Site  &HT;       
 By Jamie Beckett 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
FAO Schwarz, one of the world's largest toy stores, has plugged a
leak on its e-commerce Web site that inadvertently allowed anyone
to see consumers' e-mail addresses, telephone numbers and other
personal information.
</P>
<P>
   The leak, the latest to highlight concerns about Web security,
occurred despite the New York retailer's assurances on its site
that its technology is designed to ``guarantee the security and
privacy of our patrons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It really raises the question of how much you trust the place
you're giving out information to,'' said Space Rogue, editor of the
Hacker News Network ( &LR; www.hackernews.com &LR; ), which reported the
breach to FAO Schwarz. ``Just because it's a big brand name doesn't
mean there's no risk.''
</P>
<P>
   The toy company's leak was one of several Web security problems
in recent weeks. Under threat of a boycott, Intel Corp. recently
backed down slightly from a controversial plan to add a security
feature to its computer chips that would have been used to monitor
the online activities of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, an apparent spammer broke into the Dilbert
Zone cartoon site and stole a list of e-mail addresses of members.
Those members were then sent unsolicited e-mail offering to sell
them the list for $5. On Wednesday, Dilbert cartoonist Scott Adams
issued an online apology for the ``violation of trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the FAO Schwarz problem arose when shoppers opted
not to put their credit card information online, but to complete
their order by fax or regular mail. The company said it fixed the
leak on Wednesday after being notified by a reporter for Wired News
( &LR; www.wired.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Under normal circumstances, shoppers could choose a toy to buy
and complete an online order form for it that contained their
address, telephone number and e-mail address.
</P>
<P>
   They could put their credit card number onto the form, if they
wished. Or they could print the order form, writing the credit card
number on the form and then faxing or mailing it to the company to
complete the order.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the security breach occurred on the online form
for fax and mailing purposes. The data on this form was not secured
because FAO Schwarz assigned identification numbers sequentially on
the forms and where it stored the data.
</P>
<P>
   By changing the user identification number on the order form, a
sophisticated computer user could easily peak at information on
another customer's order form.
</P>
<P>
   Rogue said an enterprising hacker could write a computer program
to harvest and steal personal data from FAO Schwarz's database.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for FAO Schwarz said she did not receive Rogue's
e-mail, sent to the address listed on the site, until yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Adkins, vice president of public relations at the toy
company, said FAO Schwarz takes security problems on the site quite
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fixed the problem three hours after we found out about
it,'' she said, adding that users' credit card information was
never accessible, despite the leak.
</P>
<P>
   Ira Winkler, a security expert and author of ``Corporate
Espionage,'' said that FAO Schwarz apparently made two mistakes.
First, it gave users easy-to-figure-out sequential identification
numbers instead of using some random system. In addition, he said
it appears that although the toy company encrypted consumer
information while it was being transmitted, it stored the data on a
Web server instead of on a secure server behind a firewall.
</P>
<P>
   Adkins said she could not comment on the exact cause of the
leak.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think others can steal their credit card as it goes
across the Internet, but that's not it,'' said Winkler, who is also
president of the Internet Security Advisors Group ( &LR; www.isag.com &LR; ).
``It's when it's on the other side, sitting on some company's
server'' that it's vulnerable.

 EMediaweekly Ceases Publication, Fires Staff  &HT;       
 By Dan Fost  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The successor to MacWeek, once a legendary magazine catering to the
Apple Computer faithful, announced yesterday it will cease
publication immediately and lay off its 30 employees.
</P>
<P>
   EMediaweekly, which gave free subscriptions to 85,000 readers,
was published by Mac Publishing LLC, a San Francisco joint venture
of computer magazine titans International Data Group and Ziff-Davis
Publishing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``The financial model wasn't working,'' said Colin Crawford,
publisher of the magazine and president and chief executive of Mac
Publishing. ``We were not able to support it by advertising
revenues.''
</P>
<P>
   Magazines dependent on Apple for advertising have ``nowhere to
go,'' said Martin Reynolds, an analyst with Dataquest, a market
research firm in San Jose. ``There's only one supplier in the Mac
market.''
</P>
<P>
   That situation grew particularly acute in summer of 1997, when
Apple stopped licensing its technology to makers of ``clones,'' or
other computer that ran the Macintosh operating system and
software.
</P>
<P>
   MacWeek was founded in 1987 by Michael Tchong, and Ziff-Davis
bought it the following year. According to Tchong's Web site, the
magazine brought in $38 million in its peak year, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But as Apple started losing software developers to the onslaught
of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows operating system, the magazines
covering the Mac universe also began to falter.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1997, Ziff-Davis took its two Mac publications,
MacWeek and MacUser, and merged them with IDG's Macworld. MacUser
disappeared. A year later, MacWeek became eMediaweekly _ catering
to people developing content on Macs and PCs. Now only Macworld
survives in print, with Crawford claiming 500,000 paying readers.
</P>
<P>
   MacWeek and eMediaweekly live on in cyberspace, and Crawford
said he will keep adding new content to those Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Computer magazines in general are hitting some hard times. In
October, Ziff-Davis folded three magazines _ Internet Business,
Equip and Windows Pro.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, online media began to gain a foothold with
readers and advertisers, digging into print advertising sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``The malaise you're seeing in computer magazines in general is
a very strong indication of the impact the Internet is having on
tech media,'' said Tchong, MacWeek's founder, who now writes an
e-mail newsletter called Iconocast. ``There are some pretty awesome
Macintosh sites doing a fabulous job.''

 Providian Hiring 1,000 for Oakland Site  &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Providian Financial Corp., the San Francisco company that makes
loans to people with flawed credit records, announced plans
yesterday to hire up to 1,400 more employees, including 1,000 at a
new operations center in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Providian, the ninth-largest credit card lender with more than
$14 billion in assets, needs more employees to keep pace with its
phenomenal growth. Last year, Providian expanded its workforce from
nearly 4,000 to close to 6,000 to handle a customer base that had
jumped from 5 million to 8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the key profit drivers is customer and account
growth,'' said Providian Chief Financial Officer David Petrini.
``We plan to &UR;  &LR; add 200,000 to 300,000 accounts a month and need
people for sales, service and collections.''
</P>
<P>
   Providian currently has about 1,500 employees in San Francisco,
more than 2,000 in Pleasanton, about 1,000 more in Fairfield and
Sacramento, and 1,500 in Utah, Kentucky and New Hampshire. About
two-thirds of the total work the telephones.
</P>
<P>
   Providian said it picked Oakland because of its diverse,
multilingual workforce and some nice tax incentives. The company
said it was promised about $50 million in financial benefits over
10 years, including state enterprise zone hiring credits and other
tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in May, it will fill 145,000 square feet of an office
building at 1333 Broadway, which previously were occupied primarily
by city government. Providian also will hire about 400 employees
for another new operations center in Arlington, Texas, which will
help service clients in the central time zone.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike retail banks, Providian doesn't feature traditional
branches or desire walk-in traffic. It relies instead on direct
mail and telemarketing, using sophisticated credit-scoring
techniques to select customers who may have had credit problems but
can be charged enough to cover Providian's risks.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's net income last year increased 55 percent, to $296.4
million from $191.5 million in 1997. Even though the company writes
off about 6.5 percent of its consumer finance loans, which is
higher than most of its peers, its profit margins are remarkable.
Last year, the difference between the company's borrowing costs and
what it charges customers (the net interest margin) widened to 11.8
percent from 11.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PROVIDIA () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Providian is growing by acquisition as well as internal growth.
Last year, it bought a $2.2 billion credit card loan portfolio from
First Union and $350 million in credit card assets from Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter's Bravo card program.
</P>
<P>
   Providian's startling growth has not gone unnoticed on Wall
Street. Over the past 12 months, Providian's stock price has nearly
tripled, rocketing from $32 to $91.31.

 Why the Japanese Haven't Cracked U.S. PC Market  &HT;       
 By David Einstein  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Despite more than two years of trying, Japanese companies have
failed rather dismally to crack the U.S. market for desktop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sony, which began courting consumers with much fanfare in 1996,
has gained nothing but frustration, along with an insignificant
market share. According to Dataquest, Sony sold only 55,392 PCs in
the United States during the third quarter of last year, out of a
market total of 9.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba has scaled back its desktop campaign and is
concentrating on shoring up its flagging share of the notebook
market.
</P>
<P>
   Hitachi, which has been selling a $2,500 all-in-one PC with a
flat display, said yesterday it will shutter its U.S. PC operation,
headquartered in Milpitas. Hitachi Data Systems in Santa Clara,
which sells large corporate computers, will continue to operate and
may pick up some functions of the PC operation. Company officials
said 13 of 90 employees have been laid off.
</P>
<P>
   When it entered the PC market in October of 1997, Hitachi said
it hoped to sell 200,000 PCs annually in the United States. But it
sold only 10,000 in the third quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Why haven't the Japanese been able to compete? You'd think the
country that cornered the market on stereo equipment and
televisions and has taken a huge bite out of the U.S. auto market
could also succeed with PCs.
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers point to several problems that have plagued
Japanese computer companies that do business here:
</P>
<P>
   _With marketing offices in the United States and research and
development in Japan, Japanese computer-makers are hopelessly
fragmented. Language and cultural differences hinder fast, flexible
decision making. And far-flung geographical logistics make it hard
to bring new products to market quickly enough to compete against
U.S. rivals like Compaq, IBM and especially Dell, the direct-seller
that can get the latest technology into a customer's hands faster
than you can say Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of ONTECH05 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``When you have to be innovative with features and pricing on a
minute's notice, it's very difficult to do it from 5,000 miles
away,'' said Kim Brown, a PC analyst with Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   _In the automobile industry, Japan in the 1970s went up against
U.S. companies that were sluggish, lacked innovation and saw no
need to make small cars. In hindsight, the success of Toyota and
Honda was a slam dunk. But U.S. PC-makers are strong and quick, and
they haven't given the Japanese even the glint of an opening.
</P>
<P>
   _Desktop PCs have become commodities, making price the major
consideration for buyers. Sony may boast advanced audio and video _
as befits its electronics heritage _ but it hasn't been able to
compete on price in the fast-growing sub-$1,000 market.
</P>
<P>
   _Lastly, Japanese companies have hurt themselves by not offering
stock options to U.S. employees. As a result, talented sales and
marketing people tend to look elsewhere for work. ``They (the
Japanese) just refuse to acknowledge that people want a piece of
the company,'' said Brown.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of stock options may be one reason behind the troubles of
Packard Bell NEC, the Sacramento PC-maker whose market share has
been sliding for two years. Before Japanese giant NEC took control
of the company last year, Packard Bell recruited managers with the
promise of an initial public offering. But NEC has put the IPO on
hold, limiting the firm's ability to recruit.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the situation really ironic is that Japan contributes
many of the components that go inside the PC, such as floppy disk
drives, CD-ROM drives and DVD drives. And Japan is a big source for
monitors, particularly the new flat displays that are now becoming
affordable.
</P>
<P>
   That's small consolation, however, if the PC says ``Compaq'' on
the outside and has a sticker saying ``Intel Inside.''

 Travel Industry Passes First Y2K Test  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The travel industry yesterday passed a critical Year 2000 test with
flying colors.
</P>
<P>
   There were no glitches reported on the first day most airline
reservation systems could start booking airline tickets for Jan. 1,
2000, on domestic carriers like United, Delta and American.
</P>
<P>
   That was a relief for officials at the biggest travel
reservation services, the Sabre Group, Galileo International and
Worldspan, who did not know for sure until yesterday whether their
Year 2000 Problem preparations would work.
</P>
<P>
   Ronnie Hauptman, Galileo's Year 2000 project manager, said the
travel industry's success should give hope to other companies also
grappling with the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is to get started, do an inventory, evaluate your
systems and take appropriate remediation efforts,'' said Hauptman,
who was up all night watching for glitches at Galileo's
headquarters in Rosemont, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of work involved, but as our company has seen,
the payoff is tremendous. This was just another day for us, which
is just the way we wanted it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not seeing any problems with the (computer) systems at
all,'' said Dina Long, a vice president with the American Society
of Travel Agents. ``The question is, will there be enough inventory
available for everyone who wants to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem stems from a widely used space-saving shortcut
that could confuse computers into reading the year 2000 as the year
1900. That would be disastrous for the computer-reliant travel
companies that process airline, rental car, hotel and cruise
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, airline tickets for Jan. 2, 2000, will go on sale. Most
airlines only book flights up to 331 days in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Hauptman said the next test will come April 4, when tickets for
Feb. 29, 2000, will go into the computer systems. Next year is a
leap year, and an offshoot of the Year 2000 problem is the
possibility some programs may not recognize leap day correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Although most U.S. airlines began selling seats for January 1
yesterday, Southwest Airlines won't start selling tickets for
another five to seven months.
</P>
<P>
   Continental Airlines started selling seats for next year on
January 28, and has not experienced any problems.
</P>
<P>
   The big challenge for travelers now will be finding enough
accommodations for Millennium parties.
</P>
<P>
   Most cruises are booked solid and demand is heavy for hotel
rooms in popular destinations like Las Vegas and Paris, even with
prices that are reportedly 30 to 50 percent higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the high-demand destination destinations are booked
up,'' said Long. Travel agencies are now looking for hotels and
tour operators to announce more millennium vacation packages, Long
said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of Y2KTRAVE () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Also, travelers also will find most airlines are making all fares
for travel from Dec. 16, 1999, to Jan. 10, 2000, nonrefundable to
keep customers from booking on more than one carrier to reserve
seats, Long said.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines normally use that restriction for discount fares
during popular travel seasons. For the millennium, most are
extending the restriction to include full-fare seats, Long said.

 Biotech Industry Faces Urge-to-Merge Question  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Faced with a cash crunch that has changed their financial
environment, biotech firms face a Darwinian dilemma: Is the urge to
merge smarter than the drive to remain independent?
</P>
<P>
   That's what 300 biotech industry executives asked themselves
yesterday at a daylong conference in Redwood Shores on how to
finance small biotech firms when Internet startups have wowed Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
   Chiron Corp. co-founder Edward Penhoet, now dean of public
health at the University of California at Berkeley, sparked the
debate by predicting cash would never be as plentiful as in the
industry's early days, when companies like Chiron ``raised money in
ungoldly quantities'' but disappointed investors with relatively
poor returns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a financing every spring,'' Penhoet joked. ``It was
like the tulips coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco merchant banker Steve Burrill provided the data to
prove why biotech is now experiencing a winter of discontent. Since
it can take 10 years and $200 million to develop a drug, small
biotech firms need repeated cash infusions from stock and private
equity investors.
</P>
<P>
   But the inflow of money from initial public offerings and other
stock deals slipped from $4.4 billion in 1996 to $2 billion in
1998, while private financing has plateaued at $2 billion. The only
cash source on the rise is large pharmaceutical company
investments, which have soared from $2 billion in 1996 to $6.2
billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   But Burrill said some biotech firms mortgage their futures when
they accept pharmaceutical investments, because such deals usually
involve selling the marketing rights to the drugs the biotech firm
is developing.
</P>
<P>
   With these financing realities in mind, Jon Duane, cq &LR;  a
management consultant with McKinsey &AMP; Co. in Palo Alto, proclaimed
that small biotech firms _ and there are more than 200 such firms
with market capitalizations under $100 million _ would be better
off if they quit selling themselves piecemeal and merged with one
another or sold out to large biotech or drug firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consolidation is necessary,'' he said. ``And merger and
acquisition is the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner had Duane sat down than Stelios Papadopoulos, cq
 &LR; a PaineWebber merger specialist, rose to pooh-pooh the notion that
biotech firms were ripe for wholesale consolidation.

   ``For each deal, it takes a year to iron out the ego, management
and geography issues,'' Papadopoulos said.
</P>
<P>
   Adding that it takes ``creativity and craziness'' for a
scientist to start a biotech firm, he said it was a hard
psychological about-face for such visionaries to ``calm down, be
rational (and decide) it's time to merge now.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining the debate were two Bay Area CEOs who have lived through
biotech mergers. John Walker, CEO of Axys Pharmaceuticals, and
Benjamin McGraw III, CEO of Megabios Corp., said the trick in
combining biotech firms was to get any layoffs done quickly, while
wooing key people to make sure they stay.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw said he was surprised at how tough it was to get
scientists at two firms to agree on which projects have more merit
when allocating research funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will have to get really ugly with your own scientists,''
he said.

FED TAKES STEPS TO MAKE ITS ACTIVITIES MORE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Federal Reserve disclosed Thursday that it
would be somewhat more open about its secretive policy
deliberations, saying it would signal more clearly whether it was
leaning toward higher or lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing a glacial drift toward greater disclosure, the
central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee said it
had made two changes to the way it announced and described actions.
</P>
<P>
   The committee decided to drop oblique wording in the policy
statement adopted at each meeting about the likelihood of future
rate increases or decreases and replace it with a more direct
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of forcing readers to discern its leanings from the
juxtaposition of the words ``would'' and ``might'' in describing
the possible course of rate changes _ a code long familiar to Fed
watchers _ the central bank Thursday released its policy statement
from December, proclaiming its neutrality on future rate changes in
something approaching plain English.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of the evidence currently available, the committee
believes that prospective developments are equally likely to
warrant an increase or decrease'' in the Fed's key interest rate,
the policy statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also decided that it would from time to time
accelerate disclosure of any change in its assessment of the likely
direction of rate changes. Rather than disclosing any change in its
``bias'' toward higher or lower rates only after the following
meeting, as is the practice now, the Fed would make the change
public immediately on those occasions when it wanted its intentions
made clear to the public and the financial markets right away.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has been wrestling for years
with questions about the institution's traditional secrecy. He has
been seeking to protect the confidentiality of the central bank's
policy debates.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he also wants to assuage critics in Congress who feel the
Fed should be more accountable and might push for more sweeping
changes if the Fed does not act on its own to become more open. And
most of all Greenspan wants to avoid surprising the financial
markets, whose ups and downs can have a pronounced effect on the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   The last major change in the Fed's disclosure practices was in
February 1995, when the central bank began issuing a statement
after each policy meeting, indicating whether the committee had
made any change in monetary policy. Before that, changes only
became apparent as the Fed moved to carry them out the next day by
buying or selling government securities to move rates up or down.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to avoid destabilizing policy surprises, Greenspan has
taken to giving the markets relatively clear warnings of changes in
the direction of interest rates. Last September, he first hinted at
and then almost flatly promised rate reductions in the weeks before
the Fed embarked on three rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
   The latest changes were adopted at the Fed's Dec. 22 meeting and
disclosed Thursday in the minutes of that session. The Fed met
again on Tuesday and Wednesday but did not announce a change in
rates or bias.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed voted unanimously to hold rates steady and maintain a
neutral outlook in December, seeing equal possibilities that rates
might need to rise or fall in coming months, the minutes showed.
Speculation among economists has been that the Fed might have
considered adopting a bias toward higher rates this week, given the
robust growth of the economy and rising risk of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That the Fed remained silent this week about its policy bias
suggested that it had decided to remain in neutral. But because of
the wiggle room the new policy leaves _ it explicitly states that
not every change in the bias will be made public _ the markets
remained almost as much in the dark as they would have if the new
policy had not been adopted.

 Employers Can Limit Free Speech  &HT;       
 By Ilana DeBare  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  I work for a government agency and was given a written
reprimand for writing a letter to the editor of a local newspaper.
My letter was critical of the newspaper's coverage of my agency.
Admittedly, I used some colorful language to make a satirical point
and I criticized the reporters harshly. But wasn't this reprimand a
violation of my free-speech rights?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  The First Amendment says that Congress can't pass any
laws abridging freedom of speech. But it doesn't say anything about
employers who want to limit their workers' speech.
</P>
<P>
   The result is that private-sector employers have great leeway to
restrict what their employees say. Companies can penalize workers
for obscene, harassing or just plain rude conversation. They can
penalize workers for bad-mouthing the company in public. They can
even penalize employees for simply talking to the media without
prior authorization _ the kind of situation you seem to be in.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few exceptions: Private-sector employees can't be
punished for speaking out about health or safety hazards. And in
California, the state labor code says employers can't punish
workers for their political activities _ which could be interpreted
to include writing letters to the newspaper about public policy
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, you're a government worker _ not a private-sector
employee.
</P>
<P>
   So you've got a somewhat stronger free-speech claim because your
employer is the government and the First Amendment is aimed at
preventing government limits on speech.
</P>
<P>
   Does this mean your employer can't punish you for writing that
letter? Maybe. Maybe not. It depends on the details of your
situation _ what your letter said and whether it really harmed the
interests of the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts would apply a balancing test,'' said Craig Cornish,
a Colorado Springs lawyer who co-chairs the workplace-privacy
committee of the American Bar Association. ``They would look at
whether the employee's right to free speech outweighs the
government's interest in maintaining an effective workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to challenge this reprimand, you should talk to a
lawyer about the details of your case. Call the local chapter of
the American Civil Liberties Union, or call your local bar
association for a referral to an experienced employment lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs on Hold
</P>
<P>
   Q: Time and again, I've applied for an advertised position only
to be told that the job is ``on hold.'' What's going on here? Are
recruitment agencies running fictitious ads so that they can
attract a whole bunch of candidates to add to their database? I
hate to waste my time applying for positions that aren't really
open.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: Relax. This is probably just run-of-the-mill corporate
disorganization, not some diabolical plot by evil recruitment
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of WORKWAYS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  It's actually pretty common for companies to list a job but then
put the hiring process on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just did an analysis for one of our major clients and found
that of 61 job orders, they ended up canceling eight,'' said Gary
Nelson, CEO of Nelson Human Resources, a staffing firm based in
Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few of the reasons why this happens:
</P>
<P>
   _Companies may list the same job with a half-dozen recruiting
firms. Then they're swamped with candidates. So they ask the firms
to stop forwarding any more names until the hiring manager has
weeded through the existing pile.
</P>
<P>
   _Companies may be hiring so much that they lose track of which
positions they've filled. So they put some job listings on hold
while they catch up on paperwork and figure out what's still really
open.
</P>
<P>
   _Companies may have planned on filling a position but then had a
sudden budget crunch that forced them to halt hiring temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes at the end of their fiscal year, companies will have
a hiring freeze of up to a month while they have to rejustify all
the positions for the next year,'' said Eric Wheel, general manager
of Management Recruiters International in Mill Valley. ``We've even
seen cases where the hiring manager doesn't know that a job has
been frozen. The president tells human resources to freeze all
jobs, and the manager first hears about it from the recruiter.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there anything you can do to avoid applying for positions
that aren't currently available? Not really: It's just one of the
many little detours people face on the road to a new job.
</P>
<P>
   So don't take it personally, and don't get all worked up about
deceitful recruiting agencies. Just keep on applying. Eventually,
you'll get the job you want.
</P>
<P>
   Touting Wellness Training
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a small company that provides health and nutrition
training at corporations. It seems clear to me that improving the
health of employees will boost company productivity. But how do I
demonstrate this with my clients' bottom line?
</P>
<P>
   A: Your business is a tiny part of a big trend _ ``wellness
programs,'' as health promotion programs in the workplace are
called.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 survey by Hewitt Associates concluded that 91 percent of
large U.S. companies now offer some kind of wellness program, up
from 64 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   These range from cholesterol screenings and flu shots to
nutrition classes or stop-smoking workshops.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of studies have tried to document the
dollars-and-cents impact of wellness programs. ``These studies
generally conclude that companies save about $3 in medical costs or
$4 in absenteeism for every $1 spent on health promotion,'' said
Dr. Steven Freedman, a health care quality expert with William M.
Mercer in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   How can you quantify the impact of your particular trainings?
Frankly, it's very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of WORKWAYS () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Suppose you could get one of your client firms to track employee
absences before and after you provided a training. Suppose that
absences, in fact, declined.
</P>
<P>
   You'd still have a tough time proving that the decline was due
to your training _ rather than to a lighter flu season, a new crop
of younger and healthier employees, or some other unrelated factor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, your best bet is probably to rely on the general
studies cited by Freedman.
</P>
<P>
   You can find a good summary of existing research on the
financial impact of corporate wellness programs in the March/April
1998 issue of ``The Art of Health Promotion,'' which is published
by the American Journal of Health Promotion. For a back copy, call
the Journal at (248) 682-0707.

 &HT;    Murder trial just Looper's latest crisis
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Byron Looper forever linked a campaign slogan to his
identity when he legally changed his middle name last year from
Anthony to (Low Tax). But the really wacky stuff had swirled around
the former metro Atlanta resident before that.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks after he was elected tax assessor in a small Tennessee
county in 1996, Looper hardly ever came to work, according to Joel
Reimer, who was a campaign adviser to Looper and worked in the tax
office until Looper fired him. When Looper did come to work, he
worried about wiretaps in his office, according to Reimer, and
hired a security chief to investigate. In March, a grand jury
indicted him on 14 counts of official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   After a former girlfriend served him with a paternity suit,
according to a lawyer representing Looper, he said she ``left me
with heart palpitations, a small box of memorabilia and a red
G-string.''
</P>
<P>
   But questions bobbing in the wake of those minidramas lack the
weight of the one Looper will be asked about today in court: Did he
shoot to death a political rival to try to win an election in
November?
</P>
<P>
   At his Circuit Court arraignment in Crossville, Tenn., Looper
will be read a first-degree murder charge that accuses him of the
Oct. 19 fatal shooting of state Sen. Tommy Burks.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Trant, the attorney defending Looper, said he will plead
innocent. He has filed a motion to move the trial from Cumberland
County to neighboring Roane County because of ``tremendous
prejudicial publicity.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not indicated whether they have any physical
evidence linking Looper to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Brilla Garrett, who was Looper's second in command in the
assessor's office, said in a recent television interview that she
had had faith in Looper's innocence. ``I'm a supporter of his. ...
He believes he will be proven innocent,'' Garrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrest three months ago, according to published
reports, Looper has fired employees at the tax assessor's office
from his jail cell, his elected office has been stripped away, he
has been dogged for blood samples in the paternity suit, and has
fired a defense attorney. Every twist in the real-life soap opera
makes waves across the Tennessee farming region just down from the
Cumberland Plateau.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest thing to hit the county in living
memory,'' said Henry Fincher, a lawyer who managed a last-minute
write-in campaign against Looper. ``It galvanized the community.''
</P>
<P>
   A popular Democratic incumbent, Burks was found shot dead in his
pickup truck. He had been preparing to take kindergarten students
on an annual tour of his pumpkin farm.
</P>
<P>
   In the following days, Looper, the Republican opponent, was
nowhere to be found. Townspeople wondered why Looper hadn't called
the family to offer condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Police staked out Looper's house. Four days later, Looper drove
up at 12:56 a.m. in his navy blue Chevy Beretta. He calmly greeted
officers and offered them Cokes, according to news accounts of the
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   After the slaying, Looper's had been the only name left on the
ballot for Tennessee state Senate District 15. Then Burks' widow,
Charlotte, registered as a write-in candidate. She won 96 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   One of the candidates to replace Looper as tax assessor is Kim
Burks Blaylock, the oldest daughter of the man Looper is charged
with killing. From jail, Looper tried running his office. He wrote
letters and faxes. He fired a deputy assessor, accusing the man of
``poor attitude, failure to perform his job adequately and
threatening superiors.'' County officials successfully removed
Looper from office Jan. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upset by that. He wanted to keep that job,'' said
defense attorney Trant.

MARKET PLACE: E-VESTORS SHOW PATIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: (STAR) in the company name E(STAR)Trade, which appears
throughout the story, should be changed to the typographical
symbol.) 
(mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Internet stock traders are known, with some
justification, as a hair-trigger lot, bidding up the shares of
companies on the slightest hint of good news and dropping them with
scorn at the first dimming of otherwise glowing prospects.
</P>
<P>
   So why wouldn't e-vestors be bailing out of E(STAR)Trade Group
after two days in which the online broker's trading system was down
for hours at a time?
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough, Elliott Spitzer, the attorney general of
New York, said Thursday that he would investigate the Internet
trading industry after his office received complaints about delayed
orders and unavailable trading systems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet E(STAR)Trade's stock hardly flinched. Sure, it fell $1.75 a
share Thursday, to $53.50. But given the usual volatility of
Internet companies, that is essentially unchanged. And that still
leaves E(STAR)Trade's market value of $6 billion higher than more
established, and decidedly more profitable, firms like Paine
Webber, Bear, Stearns and Lehman Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors _ a good number of whom use E(STAR)Trade and its
online rivals _ have apparently concluded that the company's
problems and the cloud of complaints above the entire industry will
not ultimately rain on the parade of online investing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every other big broker in the space has also had problems and
system outages,'' said Stephen Franco, an analyst with Piper
Jaffray. ``Investors accept that the brokers use cutting-edge
technology that doesn't always work perfectly.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco released a report Thursday that indicated that the number
of online brokerage accounts last year doubled to 7.3 million, with
total assets of $420 billion.
</P>
<P>
   This growth has hardly slowed, even at brokers that have had
well-publicized system failures. Franco said, for example, that
Ameritrade was forced in the fourth quarter to pay $3.1 million to
compensate customers whose orders were mishandled. Even so, only 3
percent of its clients closed their accounts during the quarter, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is so difficult to move a brokerage account that people
rarely do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the usual crop of lawyers sprouted Thursday,
threatening to file class-action suits to recover the losses
E(STAR)Trade customers say they incurred from the unavailability of
service.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts, however, said that winning such cases would be
difficult, either as class actions or as individual suits. ``We
can't hold people liable for every honest mistake,'' said Lewis
Lowenfels, an expert in securities fraud with Tolins &AMP; Lowenfels in
New York. To win a case, he said, an investor would have to prove a
broker with a system problem committed the financial equivalent of
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   A more difficult challenge for online brokerage firms is posed
by investors who placed orders to buy initial public offerings that
were first priced at, say, less than $20 a share, then filled at
closer to $100 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Technically, the law provides little protection for investors
who place market orders, which are filled at the best available
price, rather than limit orders, which specify a maximum share
price.
</P>
<P>
   Lowenfels, though, said some brokers might be vulnerable to
complaints they violated rules requiring them to make sure
investments are suitable for their customers.
</P>
<P>
   If a broker knew that a customer who placed an order to buy
1,000 shares of a stock at $20 would not have the resources to buy
the stock if the best available price was $100 but executed the
trade anyway, that client might have a case.
</P>
<P>
   Maryann Waryjas, a lawyer with Jenner &AMP; Block in Chicago, argues
that such laws have not been adjusted to take into account brokers
that are machines, not people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, your broker would call you back and tell you the
IPO had gone way up and that you couldn't get it for the offering
price,'' she said. ``The technology has gotten ahead of the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   As for E(STAR)Trade, its contract with its customers states that
the company, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., is not liable for
system problems. But Lisa Nash, an E(STAR)Trade spokeswoman, said
that it would still compensate customers who had legitimate claims
that they were harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than hiding behind what the legal agreement says, we
will try to do what is right,'' she said. ``We have a virtual
brand. If people don't trust us, it weakens the power of the
brand.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to say how much the company expected to pay in
compensation, but she said that fewer than 10,000 customers were
affected.

<P>
   Perhaps January is not just for clearance sales anymore. Still
feeling in a spending mood even after a generous Christmas shopping
spree, Americans continued to show interest in both liquidation and
full-priced merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   January sales in stores open at least a year, a standard
industry measure, jumped an impressive 7.4 percent, according to
the Goldman, Sachs retail composite index. That was up from 4.5
percent in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The increases, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 2
percent to 3 percent, were particularly notable because they
occurred across the retail spectrum. Discounters, as usual, led the
pack. But everyone (with only a few outstanding exceptions), from
specialty apparel stores to the previously beleaguered department
stores, shined.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your numbers weren't good, you stood out like a sore
thumb,'' said Kurt Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend
Report.
</P>
<P>
   Because January is a relatively unimportant month for the retail
industry, typically accounting for only about 5 percent of annual
sales, the surprisingly buoyant sales were expected to have a
positive but minimal impact on earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Still the numbers were good enough that many in the industry
believed it indicated that January was evolving into more than just
a month to liquidate inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Feiner, a senior retail analyst with Lehman Brothers,
said, ``Up until the last years, January was a clearance month. Now
retailers are bringing in spring merchandise earlier and having the
month stand on its own instead of just dumping goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Continued consumer confidence was the main reason for rising
sales. Mary Tolan, a global managing partner for retail with
Andersen Consulting, said: ``People just have a lot more to spend.
Also they are increasingly being paid by variable compensation'' _
bonuses, for example _ ``that comes late in the year, so that could
affect January sales, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of cold winter weather after an unseasonably warm
December also played a role in pushing sweaters, snowblowers and
other seasonal goods off the shelves. Susan Eich, a spokeswoman for
Dayton Hudson Corp., said, ``There was definitely a pent-up demand
for cold weather apparel.''
</P>
<P>
   Discounters continued to barrel ahead of the crowd in January.
Wal-Mart, the nation's largest retailer, experienced a 10.3 percent
jump in sales in stores opened a year. Family Dollar topped that
performance with a 13.1 percent gain. And Target, a unit of Dayton
Hudson Corp., enjoyed a 9.6 percent rise. According to analysts,
those gains came from strong sales of regular-price merchandise as
well as sale goods.
</P>
<P>
   Specialty stores also continued their run. Sales for the Gap
Inc., powered by phenomenal performances at its Old Navy and Banana
Republic divisions, rose 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Taylor Stores posted 13.3 gains. A spokeswoman, Jill Golden,
said the company ``was pleased with customer response to both our
sale and full-priced lines.''
</P>
<P>
   The department stores, which in recent years have suffered by
being neither as cheap as the discounters nor as chic as the
specialty stores, managed to hold their own last month. Federated
Department Stores Inc., which operates both the Macy's and
Bloomingdale's chains, had an increase of 7.3 percent. Dayton
Hudson department stores even managed to outperform its hot sister
division Target with 11.8 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
   Saks Inc., which owns both Saks Fifth Avenue and the Profitt's
stores, had an 8 percent increase. A spokeswoman, Jennifer Mann,
said that clearances had been carefully controlled. ``There were no
promotions beyond those scheduled,'' at the beginning of the fiscal
year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The season's big losers were the familiarly troubled names. J.C.
Penney &UR;  &LR; saw sales in stores open a year slide 1.5 percent from last
year. The midmarket retailer, suffering from heavy competition from
discounters, has been struggling for nearly four years to redefine
its niche.
</P>
<P>
   Talbots Inc., whose results declined 13 percent, was also sorely
out of line with its competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Baum, senior retail analyst with Goldman, Sachs, said
that the most important result of the unusually strong January may
be that retailers are well positioned for the next season. ``We've
learned that the consumer is still alive and well and that most
stores have successfully cleared out fall and winter merchandise
and are set to be busy this spring,'' he said.

FRANKLIN KEYSAR, STAGE MANAGER, DIES AT 60 
 (DW)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Franklin Keysar, a production stage manager for more
than 20 Broadway shows, died on Jan. 25 at Lenox Hill Hospital in
Manhattan. He was 60 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was liver cancer, his publicist said.
</P>
<P>
   Keysar, who was born in Warren, N.H., graduated from the Boston
University School of Fine and Applied Arts. He was stage manager at
the Manhattan Theater Club for the Stephen Sondheim revue ``Putting
It Together,'' with Julie Andrews, and for Woody Allen's ``Floating
Light Bulb'' at Lincoln Center Theater.
</P>
<P>
   He also worked at the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence,
R.I., the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts and the
Long Wharf Theater in New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Uhry's ``Last Night of Ballyhoo,'' which won a Tony Award
in 1997, was Keysar's 24th Broadway show as a production stage
manager.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his mother, Bertha, of Warren; three sisters,
Phyllis Colby-Mudgett and Patti Bartlett, both of Bristol, N.H.,
and Virginia Keysar of Piermont, N.H.; and three brothers, Philip,
of Yarmouthport, Mass., Donald, of Warren, and Gary, of
Elizabethton, Tenn.

BEAR STEARNS INQUIRY EXTENDED 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A state court judge approved a move Thursday that
gives the Manhattan district attorney's office more time to
continue its investigation of the Bear Stearns Cos.' ties to the
failed brokerage firm A.R. Baron &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Edward McLaughlin of New York State Supreme Court
extended an order that has halted testimony since August in
arbitration hearings involving A.R. Baron. The stay will now last
until March 19.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are reviewing whether Bear Stearns, which cleared
A.R. Baron's trades, knew of or aided a scheme in which A.R. Baron
executives defrauded investors of $75 million. A.R. Baron and 13
former employees have pleaded guilty or have been convicted of
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors want testimony halted in the related arbitration
proceedings because they do not want witnesses in the criminal
inquiry to testify yet in the arbitrations, which might help Bear
Stearns learn about what prosecutors know.
</P>
<P>
   A Bear Stearns spokeswoman declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, The Wall Street Journal reported that the
Securities and Exchange Commission staff had notified Bear Stearns
that the staff intended to recommend that a civil lawsuit be filed
against the firm.

 &HT;    Witness ban decried as unfair
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One by one they stood, the House managers, offering
a final plea for calling witnesses in President Clinton's
impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   They made their request even though they believed the deck was
stacked against them. They made their request even though they had
been told for weeks by senators of their own party that they did
not want to hear live testimony in the sordid saga of the
president's affair with a former intern.
</P>
<P>
   As predicted, the vote for bringing forward even one witness in
the perjury and obstruction case against the president failed, and
failed big _ by 40 votes.
</P>
<P>
   Now the only way the public will hear witnesses will be via
videotapes of their depositions _ videotapes that prompted Sen.
Robert Bennett (R-Utah) to say he was glad to have had a
fast-forward button when he viewed them.
</P>
<P>
   The vote against calling witnesses to the Senate chamber only
affirmed a prevailing view among House prosecutors that the trial
has not really been a trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``The senators have denied themselves the ability to render a
fair verdict, and they have denied us the ability to present a case
in a fair way,'' said Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.), one of the
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said he no longer loses sleep over the twists in the trial
because ``all semblance of fairness'' vanished when it was made
clear weeks ago that prosecutors would not be allowed to call
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to vote it down,'' Barr said. ``The
Senate, for all their stature, is not that subtle when it comes to
telling others what it wants.''
</P>
<P>
   And even the less vocal critics of the Senate's actions agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the traditional sense of a trial, it really hasn't been,''
said Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.), the leader of the prosection team.
``It hasn't been a trial because witnesses were omitted and the
prosecution (was) restricted on how much and in what fashion they
could present their evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a different sort of a creature,'' Hyde said. ``I
wish things were different. I'd like a freer process. But we live
within the parameters they give us.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked why the prosecutors continued to push forward given
the clear resistance in the Senate from his own party, he said it
comes down to ``duty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we walk away from our duty, how do we explain that to
history?'' asked Hyde. ``It's a matter of conscience, a matter of
the Constitution. It's a matter of doing our duty, onerous and
unpleasant and backlashy as it may be.''
</P>
<P>
   If the House prosecutors had merely taken the temperature of the
country and heeded the polls, the trial would have been long over,
Hyde said. But that would not be upholding the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors say that from the beginning they have had to
fight to win approval for procedures that are considered de rigueur
in typical court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   That point was dutifully noted by Rep. James Rogan (R-Calif.),
the prosecutor who grilled White House aide Sidney Blumenthal under
oath earlier in the week.
</P>
<P>
   In urging the Senate to call witnesses to the floor, Rogan said
it was unusual to stop the ``triers of fact'' from calling
witnesses to prove their charges.
</P>
<P>
   There is a reason the Founding Fathers created a judiciary
system in which trials are open, he said. ``For the sake of this
body, please allow this trial to be a public trial in the real
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The frustration of the prosecutors boiled to the surface after
the vote on calling a witness failed. Rogan and White House
attorney David Kendall tussled over Kendall's request to view the
video snippets that the prosecution wanted to display Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the appropriate legal response to your request is
that it is none of your damn business what the other side is going
to put on,'' said Rogan, quoting a former California Supreme Court
justice's response to a similar request in a case there.
</P>
<P>
   To that Kendall retorted that he didn't think that ``trial by
surprise has a place here.''
</P>
<P>
   After it was over, Sen. Paul Coverdell (R-Ga.) said he thought
the proceedings had been fair. Sure, House prosecutors did not get
everything they had sought, but that is the case with any
proceeding. ``I think we've been fair to all parties,'' Coverdell
said.
</P>
<P>
   That is hardly how the House prosecutors see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so sorry that there was such a push on the part of some to
just ram through this thing and treat it as though it was an
afterthought, rather than a constitutional process,'' Rogan said.

THE FINE LINE BETWEEN AN OFFER OF HELP AND A BRIBE 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: See also OLY-Drug)  By IAN FISHER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ What is the difference, Charles Mukora wondered
Thursday, between a sincere offer to help athletes in a poor nation
like Kenya and a bribe?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' said Mukora, 64, who has found himself
portrayed as a villain, if a pleasant one, in the Olympic bribery
scandal. ``Perhaps you can tell me?''
</P>
<P>
   Mukora was expelled last month as a member of the International
Olympic Committee after being accused of accepting $34,650 for his
personal use from officials in Salt Lake City seeking to steer the
2002 Winter Games their way. He admits to taking the cash.
</P>
<P>
   But Mukora, one of more than 100 officials from around the world
who decide where to award the lucratively valuable designation of
Olympic site, contends that the money went solely to train distance
runners at a camp he owns that faces the gorgeous snowy cap of
Mount Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   Disputing the conclusions of the Olympic committee that ousted
him, Mukora says his only crime is to have been caught in an
inevitable conflict. He is from a poor nation _ and from Africa,
like three other of the six expelled committee members _ with
little money to train athletes but with the power to help decide
where the Games will be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you travel to a rich country or people from rich countries
visit you, you more or less point out the areas you want to
develop,'' said Mukora, who insisted he had never promised his vote
to anyone. ``Usually, the likely thing, they will suggest, `We can
do this or this.' And usually they offer to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Olympic officials, past and present, acknowledge the logic
of Mukora's argument. It is no accident, they say, that Olympic
committee members from Africa and South America have found
themselves caught up in the scandal, and it does not mean that
Africans or others from underdeveloped countries are more disposed
to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics have over the last 20 years grown into a huge and
quite profitable enterprise, and cities around the world have
become aggressive in trying to win the rights to stage them. At the
same time, the Olympic committee responsible for awarding the Games
has expanded to include more and more members from countries that
often have no chance of staging the Games themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The neediest countries, said Keba Mbaye, an IOC member from
Senegal who was on the six-member commission that investigated Salt
Lake City, are those most vulnerable to inducements.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of targeting of members and their votes has not been
helped, Olympic officials concede, by the imprecise guidelines laid
out by the IOC itself. The committee allows competing cities to
offer aid to sports programs in the countries of committee members
voting on the bids, but forbids such aid being given in return for
a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between an offer and a bribe,'' Mukora concluded,
``must be really very thin.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Mukora's protest that he is an ``innocent victim of
circumstance,'' there has been little public sympathy for him here
because many people suspect that the allegation he benefited
personally might be true.
</P>
<P>
   His Mount Kenya camp is a weedy collection of old farm buildings
where on one recent day two athletes performed perfunctory
stretches in front of a visiting reporter. He has also been accused
of receiving what amounted to $35,000 from officials in Sydney,
Australia and, oddly, a shipment of 500 bicycles from Beijing. Both
cities vied for the Games in 2000. Sydney officials have admitted
that they cannot definitively say where at least $12,000 they gave
to Mukora wound up.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of his friends _ like the legendary runner, Kipchoge
Keino, who Mukora coached to a gold medal in the 1968 Olympics _
applauded his decision last week to resign from the International
Olympic Committee rather than fight his expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   This past week, Mukora also resigned as head of Kenya's national
Olympic committee, a post he had held for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know you are guilty of whatever you have done, why
argue?'' asked Keino, who is reported to be in line as Mukora's
successor on the national committee.
</P>
<P>
   It was a sharp fall for a man who, for more than three decades,
had been the public face of sports in Kenya. As a coach and sports
administrator, he had done perhaps as much as anyone to make Kenyan
athletes some of the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though he had been a soccer and field hockey player in his own
right, Mukora rose to prominence after he coached the Kenyan
national team at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, where the nation
won its first gold medals and marked the beginning of three decades
of successes in track and field. The team performed well under
Mukora's coaching four years later at the Olympic Games in Munich.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969 he became a marketing trainee for Coca-Cola in Nairobi.
Soon he became the manager of external affairs and Coke's liason to
the sports world. Newspaper clippings that track his career, in
business and in the intrigues of amateur sports, are uniformly
glowing. He retired from Coke in 1990 for what he then called
``greener pastures.''
</P>
<P>
   He later became involved in politics. He represented a district
near Mount Kenya between 1992 and 1997 in Parliament and is said to
be close to Mwai Kibaki, head of the Democratic Party, who finished
second in the 1997 presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   But his real job began just before he left Coke. He became, in
quick succession, head of the national Olympic committee and a
delegate to the international committee. Money appears to have been
a major concern of his from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the high quality of its athletes, Kenya has few
reliable, and no large, sources of income to train Olympic
athletes. The government gives only sporadically, according to the
national committee.
</P>
<P>
   Several private camps for runners _ the athletes who receive the
best care in Kenya _ are sponsored by shoe companies like Fila.
Nike has helped pay the national committee's expenses for seven
years now.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics, like Mukora Thiong'o, a former friend who is
secretary general of Kenya's wrestling program, suggested that at
least some money went into Mukora's own pocket. He accused Mukora,
for example, of selling the 500 bicycles from Beijing from a sports
shop he owned in downtown Nairobi. Mukora did not deny the
allegation in a news conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   Mukora also has given conflicting accounts of the money given
the Kenyan Olympic committee by Sydney. He initially said that the
money went only to train Kenyan athletes in Australia but later
said that, like the money from Salt Lake City, some $10,000 went
into a private foundation, which he runs with his son Peter, that
funds the camp near Mount Kenya. Mukora said he envisions the camp
as a huge athletic center that will ultimately cost $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, sports officials in Toronto say that Mukora was one
of two members of the Amateur Athletic Association who tried
unsuccessfully to solicit $1 million for their votes in 1991 to
award Canada the 1993 outdoor track and field championships.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lives in a wealthy part of Nairobi, Mukora has said he
would not fight his expulsion because he cannot afford to fly to
the Olympic headquarters in Switzerland to defend himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I am rich because I wear nice clothes,'' he said
after a news conference last week. ``But I'm a poor man.'' &QL;

VAN GUNDY TONES EGOS DOWN, AND KNICKS ARE LOOKING UP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Pa., Ind., N.Y. )  By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last April, Jeff Van Gundy clung to the leg of Heat
center Alonzo Mourning and allowed himself to be dragged around the
floor like a rodeo clown.
</P>
<P>
   Five months before that, Van Gundy stood outside of a locker
room in Philadelphia after a miserable Knick loss and ridiculed his
own coaching abilities, saying, ``I disgraced myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last three years, Van Gundy has been his players'
tireless protector and defender through flagrant fouls, fights and
suspensions. As a Knicks assistant coach for seven years, he was
the same way, once letting loose with an irrational outburst in
defense of John Starks. At the root of all these instances, is one
noble cause: his players.
</P>
<P>
   With the reputation Van Gundy has constructed, it is no wonder
that Latrell Sprewell, upon his introduction as a Knick two weeks
ago, referred to Van Gundy as a ``players' coach.'' While Van Gundy
shrugged off Sprewell's assessment, there is no doubting the
emotional bond the coach has created between himself and his top
players. He is unshakably close and unconditionally loyal.
</P>
<P>
   But is he too close, too loyal? Or has he struck just the right
relationship with his players to pull off the challenge before him?
When the renovated Knicks open the season in Orlando Friday, the
37-year-old Van Gundy will begin juggling a carton full of egos
that could crack at any time.
</P>
<P>
   As delicately as possible, he will try to integrate the brazen
aggressiveness of Sprewell without setting back the progress Allan
Houston made last year. He will attempt to deploy an undersized
Larry Johnson at power forward without risking his wear, and push
Marcus Camby without alienating him.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, he has to convince Patrick Ewing that he is just as
star-worthy as a rebounder as he was in his decadelong role as the
only go-to guy in orange, white and blue. Perhaps Van Gundy,
leaning on a 10-year relationship with Ewing, has just the right
delivery, timing and tact to change the role of an often-stubborn
superstar.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was impossible for me,'' said Mavericks Coach Don Nelson,
who was fired after four stormy months with the Knicks in 1996.
``Patrick still saw himself as a dominant player, and I didn't see
it. He wasn't ready to accept change, just like Johnny Starks
wasn't ready to accept the sixth-man role for me. It's a difficult
thing. The person has to be ready to do it and make the sacrifice
for the team. Now, maybe it's different. I would think it wouldn't
be as hard for Patrick. But that wasn't the case when I was there.
It didn't work out for me. As a result, I wasn't there very long.''
</P>
<P>
   Lose Ewing, and Van Gundy could lose his longtime ally. Lose too
many games, and his ``player's coach'' label won't matter. Van
Gundy, with two years to go on a $2 million-a-year contract,
understands the tenuous nature of his position, and tries to find
humor in it.
</P>
<P>
   On the wall in his office, there is a framed back page from a
tabloid: Van Gundy with his neck in a noose. After Dave Checketts,
the president of Madison Square Garden, submerged his own morality
code and made a trade for the controversial Sprewell, the Knicks
are afloat in more talent than ever. There's no Michael Jordan in
the way, and no more excuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is, if we're not successful, I won't be here,''
Van Gundy said. ``I know that in every NBA job you win or you're
out. I know guys like a Phil Jackson _ or whoever else _ would want
this job. It's a very good job. But after three years, I think I'm
much more comfortable with the fact I've proven I can do a good
job. So I'm pretty secure with what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Sprewell's past, which includes the choking of the
Golden State coach, P.J. Carlesimo, Van Gundy was unabashed in his
desire to coach the three-time All-Star. He asked for this, and now
he has to alter a decade-old offense that centered on Ewing in the
post and a defense that relied on the jettisoned Charles Oakley in
the paint. Now, everyone has to pass, and everyone has to rebound.
Van Gundy has all but turned a theme of unselfishness into a
campaign slogan: Up with teamwork, down with ego.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unselfishness is there right now,'' Van Gundy said after a
good practice on Wednesday. ``When the lights go on, and the stats
are kept, I think we'll see for real.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   Last year, the Pacers eliminated the Knicks in the second round.
Still, last year was a breakthrough season for Van Gundy. Not only
did he piece together a playoff team with a lineup threadbare after
injuries to Ewing and Chris Dudley, but he also managed to separate
himself from the shadow of Pat Riley. As a punctuation to that
fact, Van Gundy's undermanned team _ without Johnson, too, because
of his Game 4 fight with Mourning _ walked into Miami Arena and
defeated the specter of Riley with a Game 5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Van Gundy was not the student anymore. But Van
Gundy did not go unscathed last year, either. Often, his
substitution patterns were erratic and seemed guided by the comfort
he had with the players he knew well and was loyal to. As a result,
Van Gundy was criticized for trusting Starks, but wavering on
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I wouldn't have had it any other way,'' said
Houston, who, at the urging of Van Gundy, developed a more
aggressive game last year. ``With Jeff, as frustrated as I got, I
knew he saw something in me and had high expectations of me. He
still does. He still gets on me in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside of practice, Van Gundy is selectively critical. He may
pick on Camby's work ethic, and question Dennis Scott's
conditioning. But almost as a policy, Van Gundy never points a
finger at his prized players, certainly not Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's owes much of his rise to Ewing. Some of his own
players privately wondered if Van Gundy's attachment to Ewing was a
detriment to the team during last year's playoff series against
Indiana. Ewing made a valiant return from wrist surgery, but did
Van Gundy allow him too many minutes and too many shots?
</P>
<P>
   This year, Van Gundy's balancing act will be scrutinized even
more. But after all the time Van Gundy has spent building
relationships with his players and becoming the ``player's coach''
his team has grown to trust him unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all respect Jeff,'' Houston said. ``We believe in what he's
doing.''

OTTAWA AND PROVINCES (BUT NOT QUEBEC) AGREE ON SOCIAL PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By ANTHONY DePALMA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A new deal that was supposed to reinforce Canada's
fragile national union by balancing power between the federal and
provincial governments has once again isolated the mostly
French-speaking province of Quebec from the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   After a closed-door meeting Thursday at Prime Minister Jean
Chretien's private residence in Ottawa, the leaders of nine
provinces and two territories agreed to a three-year administrative
arrangement under which the federal government agreed not to
introduce new national social programs unless a majority of the
provinces first accepted them.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government also agreed that any new programs dealing
with health, education or other social benefits would come with
federal funds.
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive to the provinces, the federal government also
agreed to increase money to the provinces for health care. The
exact amount will not be known until the new federal budget is
revealed later this month, but it is expected to total several
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Until last Saturday, Quebec's leaders believed they could accept
Ottawa's offer, which would have been taken as a strong sign of
Quebec's willingness to remain in Canada after several attempts to
separate.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Premier Lucien Bouchard of Quebec said the federal
government had dropped an important provision that would have
allowed provinces to back out of national programs but still accept
the federal funds that would have accompanied them, if they
substituted local programs with similar goals and standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not on the same train today,'' Bouchard said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Quebec's refusal to join, Chretien called the new
arrangement a success. ``This will make Canada better,'' he told
reporters after the four-hour meeting broke up.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Mike Harris of Ontario said, ``It is an advance for all
of us, including Quebec.''
</P>
<P>
   The struggle between Ottawa and the provinces has gone on since
Canada's beginning in 1867. Mindful of the way strong states'
rights in the United States had contributed to the outbreak of the
Civil War, Canada's founders attempted to form a strong central
government.
</P>
<P>
   But partly because of the special demands of Quebec, which sees
itself as a separate nation, and also because of the western
provinces' desire for control of their own affairs, power has been
shifting to the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the federal government continues to try to impose some
sense of national identitity, fearing that unbridled provincial
power could lead to uneven levels of social benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to offer the same thing to everybody,'' said
Chretien, who has been especially worried that without national
social programs, poor provinces might try to offer reduced levels
of services.
</P>
<P>
   But the provinces often see federal programs as unacceptable
meddling. Even something as seemingly uncontroversial as college
scholarships for needy students caused an uproar because Chretien,
who considers the scholarships part of his legacy as prime
minister, wants the federal government to bypass provincial
education officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a personal victory for Chretien, the arrangement signed
Thursday allows Ottawa to provide education grants when the money
goes directly to recipients, but not when it goes to educational
institutions.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unarmed West African immigrant with no criminal
record was killed early Thursday morning by four New York City
police officers who fired 41 shots at him in the doorway of his
Bronx apartment building, police said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday why the officers had opened fire on the
man at 12:44 a.m. in the vestibule of his building at 1157 Wheeler
Ave. in the Soundview section of the Bronx. The man, Amadou Diallo,
22, who came to the United States from Guinea more than two years
ago and worked as a street peddler in Manhattan, died at the scene,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bronx District Attorney's office is investigating the
shooting, whose details were still murky Thursday night because
there were apparently no civilian witnesses and none of the police
officers involved have given statements to investigators. But
Inspector Michael Collins, a police spokesman, said investigators
who went to the scene of the shooting did not find a weapon on or
near Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and neighbors described Diallo as a shy, hard-working
man with a ready smile, a devout Muslim who did not smoke or drink.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very angry,'' said his uncle, Mamadou Diallo. ``He was a
skinny guy. Why would the police shoot somebody of that nature 30
or 40 times? We see the police and we give them all the respect we
have.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend, Demba Sanyang, 39, said: ``We have a very undemocratic
society back home, and then we come here. We don't expect to be
killed by law enforcement officers.''
</P>
<P>
   The four officers involved in the shooting were assigned to the
aggressive Street Crimes Unit, which focuses largely on taking
illegal guns off the street. All four officers, who were in
plainclothes, used their 9-millimeter semiautomatic service
pistols, which hold 16 bullets and can discharge all of them in
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the officers, Sean Carroll, 35, and Edward McMellon, 26,
emptied their weapons, firing 16 shots each, police said. Officer
Kenneth Boss, 27, fired his gun five times and Officer Richard
Murphy, 26, fired four times. All four have been put on
administrative leave.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the officers _ Carroll, McMellon and Boss _ have been
involved in shootings before, which is unusual in a department
where more than 90 percent of all officers never fire their weapons
in the line of duty. In those previous incidents, Carroll and
McMellon were found to have acted properly, police said; the case
of Boss _ he shot and killed a man said to be armed with a shotgun
on Oct. 31, 1997, in Brooklyn _ is still being reviewed by the
Brooklyn district attorney's office.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Police officers are trained not to fire unless they fear for the
lives of themselves or others. But once they decide to shoot, they
aim for the center of the body and fire until they ``stop'' their
target.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, the four officers were patrolling the East
Bronx in an unmarked car, hoping, the department said, to make
arrests and in the process turn up information about a serial
rapist in the area.
</P>
<P>
   At 12:44 a.m., the officers encountered Diallo. All four got out
of the car and approached him as he stood in the vestibule of his
building, the department said.
</P>
<P>
   A police official who spoke on condition of anonymity said that
a neighborhood resident who had gone out to move his car to another
parking spot reported seeing a man, who police believe was Diallo,
loitering in the vestibule. The man described him as ``acting
suspicious,'' said the official, who did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   The officers did not communicate over their radios before they
approached Diallo, police said, so investigators do not have an
initial report of why they confronted him.
</P>
<P>
   A second police official who spoke on condition of anonymity
said, ``We don't know what happened, because we haven't spoken to
them, but it looks like one guy may have panicked and the rest
followed suit.''
</P>
<P>
   After the shooting, the officers called in on their radios,
police said, and neighbors telephoned 911. Soon other officers
arrived on the scene, followed by detectives and the ranking
officers who are required to respond to all police shootings.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation began, and no weapon was found on Diallo,
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   A pager and a wallet were found lying next to his body, a police
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, a member of the Fulani ethnic group, came from the
village of Lelouma. He came to New York two and a half years ago,
following the steps of relatives. He worked as a street peddler,
selling socks, gloves and videos on 14th Street in Manhattan. He
sent much of the money he earned to his parents back home, friends
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Diallo arrived home from work around midnight, said
his roommate, Momodou Kujabi. The two men discussed who was going
to pay the Con Edison bill, and then Diallo turned on the
television and Kujabi went to bed. Another roommate, Diallo's
cousin, Abdou Rahman Diallo, was already asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Kujabi said he thought Diallo might have gone out for something
to eat, as he often did after coming home from work.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the shots, and a knock on the door, he said. It was
the police.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kujabi said the officers brought him down to the vestibule to
identify his friend's body. ``I said, `How can this happen?'''
Kujabi recalled. ``I left this guy less than 30 minutes ago.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy found that Diallo died of multiple gunshot wounds to
the torso, said Ellen Borakove, a spokeswoman for the Chief Medical
Examiner's Office. Further tests are required to learn how many
wounds there were and where the bullets entered his body, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart London, a lawyer representing the officers, said he was
still trying to determine the facts of the case. ``It would be
premature to comment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani urged people to withhold judgment on the
case. ``We've had terrible mistakes in this city when people have
reacted to rumors and intuitions and feelings,'' he said. ``Let's
let the situation run its course and then let's react to the
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   But as news of the shooting spread through the neighborhood,
where many immigrants from Mauritania and Guinea live, people
gathered to ask themselves why a young man with no history of
trouble would be shot by police.
</P>
<P>
   Kyle Waters, a lawyer representing Diallo's family, said: ``My
concern is that this was an overreaction on the part of the New
York City Police Department. There was nothing to indicate that he
was a criminal, nothing to indicate that he had a weapon. For him
to be sent back to his homeland in Guinea in a box is a horrible
tragedy. The family wants some sort of justice here.''
</P>
<P>
   New York state Assemblyman Ruben Diaz, who represents the area,
said: ``I'm appalled by this. It's outrageous. It clearly shows
excessive force was used.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Reed, a spokesman for the Bronx district attorney's
office, said, ``The shooting is under investigation by our office,
and it's likely that it will be subject to a grand-jury review.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the circumstances of the shooting were unclear
because the officers involved had invoked what is known as the
48-hour rule, which gives police officers two business days to
consult with their union lawyers before they speak to
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But police officials said that was not the case; instead, they
said, they have not spoken to the officers because the Bronx
district attorney's office asked them not to. That is common
practice in police shootings.
</P>
<P>
   First, prosecutors pursue possible criminal charges, and police
officers, like other citizens, can invoke their right against
self-incrimination. Then the Police Department pursues possible
administrative charges. The 48-hour rule comes into play here,
because police officers can be dismissed if they refuse to answer
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Diallo's relatives began making plans to return his
body to his parents in the village of Lelouma. ``I think there is
no reason to shoot someone more than 30 times,'' said Mamadou
Diallo.

IOC ADOPTS WATERED-DOWN DRUG DECLARATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By PAUL L. MONTGOMERY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ After three days of debate, the
International Olympic Committee adopted a watered-down declaration
on doping Thursday at its drug summit that only underscored its
eroded authority.
</P>
<P>
   While Juan Antonio Samaranch, the IOC president, said the
declaration brought ``hope for the athletes of the world, hope for
the fans and hope for human dignity,'' the 15-nation European Union
rejected the Olympic committee's leadership and did not approve the
declaration as the summit came to a close Thursday U.S. support was
lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the American position on doping fell under
attack again. Richard Pound, an IOC vice president from Canada,
criticized the United States' attitude toward doping, pointedly
noting that Mark McGwire, who used a supplement banned by the
Olympics while setting the home run record last summer, had become
a national hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer you are to the Olympic movement, the more you are
concerned about doping,'' Pound said. ``The farther away from it
you are, the less you care. All of a sudden you are in Mark McGwire
land, and this is a national hero all souped up.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's efforts to push through an antidoping program that it
would control failed during the summit here.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution adopted on Thursday proposes only the
establishment of a committee at the IOC and work by the national
governments within three months to form a council of the proposed
committee to elect a president, appoint a staff and begin work by
the summer games in Sydney, Australia, next year.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC backed off actually creating an antidoping agency and
imposing mandatory two-year drug sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Banks, the British minister of sport, who has been
prominent in the attack on Samaranch and the IOC, said some of the
provisions of Thursdays resolution were ``both minimalist and
permissive.'' ``These issues are bigger than the IOC,'' he said.
``It might come as a surprise to the IOC to find there is actually
something bigger than the IOC, but there is.''
</P>
<P>
   From Washington, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, the director of the
Office of National Drug Control Policy, who had represented the
U.S. government at the conference but left early, expressed
qualified approval of the resolution. He said that it was a ``good
first step'' but that the United States had concerns about the
creation of a worldwide antidoping agency independent of the IOC,
stiffer sanctions for athletes caught using drugs, and the will of
international sports to step up research into detecting currently
undetectable performance-enhancing substances.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC called the conference last summer after doping scandals
at the Tour de France and elsewhere and had expected to remain in
charge of the worldwide antidrug effort. In the meantime, however,
some European governments began to take antidoping action
independent of international sports bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The main IOC proposal was for creation of a worldwide agency to
conduct drug testing in and out of competition, refine analyses of
urine and blood samples, and educate the young against using sports
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Before the conference, Samaranch said he expected to preside
over the agency and suggested Prince Alexandre de Merode, who has
headed the Olympics' antidrug committee for 30 years, as director.
Soon after the conference opened, however, most of the major
industrialized countries indicated that continued IOC control of
the antidoping effort would be unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he might be elected president of the proposed
committee, Samaranch said, ``I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Banks said Samaranch's control of the antidoping agency was
unlikely, however, ``If we are going to start off the right foot, I
think it would be better for the IOC not to be in the chair,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The equally contentious problem of sanctions for athletes caught
doping was also not resolved. The IOC had proposed a minimum
two-year ban for a first offense and the existing life ban for a
second. In the final declaration, powerful sports federations in
the Olympic movement for cycling, soccer and tennis had won
mitigation of the two-year ban if special circumstances were found.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism at the conference ranged beyond the Olympic movement
when Pound made his remarks about McGwire, who acknowledged last
summer that he used the supplement androstenedione, which is banned
by the IOC, the NF L and the NCAA.
</P>
<P>
   The dietary supplement is not banned by Major League Baseball,
the NBA or the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire's agent, Robert Cohen, called Pound's statement
``incorrect and highly irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Major League Baseball Players Association also
took exception to Pound's comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's unfortunate but the pressure of the IOC's other
problems seem to be having their effect on Pound,'' said Donald
Fehr, the association's executive director, alluding to the bidding
scandal enveloping the Olympic committee.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fordham bills itself as ``New York City's Jesuit
university.'' But apart from a courtyard statue of Mary and Jesus
and handsome stained-glass windows in a student lounge on its Rose
Hill campus in the Bronx, there are few outward signs of Fordham's
Roman Catholic identity.
</P>
<P>
   Mass is not required. There are no crucifixes in the classrooms.
The faculty of more than 500 includes only 37 Jesuits. And although
the university's president is a Jesuit, the chairman of the board,
the chairwoman of the theology department and the faculty chairman
are not even Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   From Notre Dame to Georgetown, most Catholic colleges and
universities operate similarly _ as secular institutions that make
only a respectful nod to Catholic traditions in their mission
statement.
</P>
<P>
   But a committee of American bishops, in response to a Vatican
request, has proposed rules that would make Catholic colleges and
universities more answerable to the church _ a move that has
alarmed many Catholic scholars and teachers, who fear their
autonomy and academic freedom are being threatened.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting in Washington this week, the Association of
Catholic Colleges and Universities discussed ideas for a
counterproposal that they would present to the committee by May.
The full National Conference of Bishops is expected to vote on the
issue later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Since the bishops have no direct control over most of the
universities, they would have to rely on moral suasion _ and the
universities' reluctance to antagonize the church _ to persuade
schools and their trustees to go along.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these Catholic colleges wants to throw away its
Catholic identity,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of America,
the weekly Jesuit journal of opinion. ``But if these guidelines
were adopted, the colleges would be put between a rock and a hard
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the bishops' rules in particular have caused concern
among educators. One calls for university presidents to be
``faithful Catholics'' and for new presidents to make a profession
of faith and take an oath of fidelity to the church. A second calls
for theology professors, who are now subject to the same criteria
for hiring and promotion as other academic appointees, to be
approved by church officials. The last requirement directs colleges
and universities to fill a majority of the positions on faculties
and boards of trustees with ``faithful Catholics.''
</P>
<P>
   To many Catholic educators, these proposals are blind to the
realities of American higher education: They would handicap them in
recruiting faculty members and students and in receiving government
money, and they raise legal concerns on issues like tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will marginalize our institutions,'' said the Rev. Joseph
O'Hare, president of Fordham. ``The proposals are well-intentioned,
but they might have just the opposite effect they are intended to
have.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article in the Jan. 30 issue of America, the Rev. Edward
Malloy, president of the University of Notre Dame, and J. Donald
Monan, chancellor of Boston College, found the proposals
``profoundly detrimental to Catholic higher education.''
</P>
<P>
   In an earlier issue, the magazine called them ``unworkable and
dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone sees the proposals as a threat. The Rev. James
Conn, a dean and professor of canon law at St. Mary's Seminary and
University in Baltimore, said the concepts already exist in the
church's canon law and are entirely appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was not a whole lot of attention being paid to them,''
he said. ``Now we're saying that they are not going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. David O'Connell, president of the Catholic University
of America in Washington, says he does not believe the proposals
will destroy academic freedom or institutional autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe that the church should clearly be involved in the
institutions that exist under its sponsorship,'' said O'Connell,
whose university is the only national university of the Roman
Catholic Church in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   While other college presidents have objected to being required
to make public oaths of allegiance to the church, O'Connell recited
both a profession of faith and an oath of fidelity when he was
installed as president in November. He said he was baffled that
others were surprised by his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profession of faith that I made is the same profession
that is recited by millions of Catholics each Sunday,'' O'Connell
said. ``The oath is a further expression of commitment to church
teaching, something appropriate to my role as president but also
appropriate to my place within the communion of the Catholic
Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Catholic universities around the world are already
under church jurisdiction, those in the United States _ established
by orders like the Jesuits and the Benedictines or by dioceses _
were pulled into a more secular orbit decades ago, partly because
of the need for government funds but also because of the less
religious nature of American culture itself.
</P>
<P>
   The distance widened in the 1960s, spurred by the freer spirit
promoted after the Second Vatican Council was convened and by the
shrinking participation in religious orders, which forced colleges
once run by the clergy to look increasingly to laymen, even
non-Catholics, to fill classrooms and board rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to reverse these trends comes from Pope John Paul
II, who has sought to reassert the church's primacy in many spheres
and to step back from Vatican II. In 1990, after extensive
consultation with higher education officials, the pope spelled out
his vision in a paper entitled Ex Corde Ecclesiae, or ``From the
Heart of the Church,'' where, he said, universities were born. It
acknowledged cultural and legal differences around the world, but
left details to be worked out region by region.
</P>
<P>
   American church and university leaders have tried three times to
spell out specific norms for Catholic colleges and universities. A
first attempt was deemed overly binding. A second draft was
approved by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in 1995 by
a vote of 224-6. It affirmed respect for church authority but
called for institutional autonomy and academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the Vatican rejected that version and directed the Americans
to develop a more ``juridical'' version that explicitly addressed
the relationships between church officials and colleges. It is that
attempt, fashioned by a panel of five canon law experts and led by
Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, that so alarmed many
university presidents when it was presented to the bishops'
conference in November.
</P>
<P>
   Like other institutions of higher education, the more than 230
Catholic colleges and universities in the United States are
chartered by local government bodies, accredited by peers from
other academic institutions and receive little or no money from the
church. The colleges, which have more than 600,000 students,
express their Catholic identity in a variety of ways; for most,
however, it is a subtle but distinctive theme.
</P>
<P>
   Fordham's health center, for example, does not dispense condoms
or birth control pills or advice on abortions. The university
refused to grant a group of gay and lesbian students club status or
to give them financial support.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, in the Jesuit tradition, the college
emphasizes community service and tries to provide a moral grounding
for its students. All students are required to take two theology
courses, where they discuss concepts like ``what is religion?'' and
look at world religions, including Catholicism _ courses that take
an analytical approach and in which teachers might even differ from
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic university presidents list an array of problems they
would face if the latest proposals were adopted. One is whether
independent trustees would surrender their authority to the church.
Another is that the emphasis on ``faithful Catholics'' could cause
non-Catholics who make financial and academic contributions to the
university to feel like second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want Protestants, Jews, agnostics, Buddhists and
others to think they have no place here,'' said the Rev. William
Leahy, president of Boston College. ``I don't want the message sent
that we only tolerate them, that they'll be second in priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another difficulty is how to determine who is a faithful
Catholic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean we inquire into people's private lives?'' asked
O'Hare, Fordham's president. ``That would be very distasteful. And
in today's culture, we would not want to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has pledged himself to his Jesuit order, O'Hare
said he was put off by the idea of university presidents being
asked to make a public profession of faith and an oath of fidelity
to the Catholic Church. Asked what he would do, he expressed
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if I were a married man, and my wife said, `We can't
go on this way,''' he said. ``I'd have to make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, many Catholic universities are already making
changes. Some, like Georgetown University in Washington and St.
Francis College in Brooklyn, are putting crucifixes in classrooms
again. Others, like Fordham, are establishing new institutes and
research initiatives to pursue religious issues. Boston College has
created a ``vice president for university mission and ministry,''
and now orients new faculty members about the college's Jesuit
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   As the colleges seek to redefine their Catholic identity, a
constant concern is the reaction of their students, many of them
non-Catholic. While some may hunger for a stronger church presence,
others are wary, and say they would not attend a Catholic
university if it were subject to the tenets now being proposed by
the bishops' committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened tomorrow,'' said Ryan Brenizer, a junior at
Fordham, ``I would consider transferring.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenizer, a Baptist, said he chose Fordham because of a
full-tuition scholarship and its rigorous _ and nondoctrinaire _
academic program. ``As part of your education, you are supposed to
be able to examine your own values, and risk them,'' he said.

KRAFT, AN EARLY BIRD, SHARES LEAD WITH QUIGLEY 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., Cal.)  By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. _ Greg Kraft was awake by dawn on Thursday
morning, but the early start was worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing the second-earliest tee time at Pebble Beach Golf Links,
Kraft enjoyed his best round of the year, taking advantage of calm
early-morning conditions and perfectly manicured greens. Shooting a
six-under-par 66 and heading a leader board that included some
unexpected names, Kraft shared the lead with Brett Quigley after
Thursday's first round of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jacobsen, who won at Pebble Beach in 1995, was one stroke
behind in third place after shooting a 67 at Poppy Hills, one of
three courses on which the tournament is played.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the weather problems that have plagued this prestigious
event in recent years, 8 of the top 12 players in the world ranking
have entered _ Tiger Woods, David Duval, Mark O'Meara, Davis Love
III, Vijay Singh, Jim Furyk, Justin Leonard and Phil Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   With names like that in the field, who expected Kraft and
Quigley to share the first-round lead? Yet, while many prominent
players started slowly _ Duval, winner of 9 of his last 29 events,
shot an even-par 72 at Spyglass Hill Golf Course _ Kraft was
steady, in a bogey-free round that included six birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty comfortable on the greens today, after coming
here for eight years,'' said Kraft, a 34-year-old from Clearwater,
Fla., who is still looking for his first victory on the PGA Tour.
``My first few years here, I didn't understand that everything
breaks to the ocean. It took a little while to trust and learn
that. But I like it so much here, I've never skipped it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into the day, I was worried about my early draw. It
could be damp, cold, windy. I was wondering what to expect.
Actually, it was very benign, not much wind, and it wasn't that
cold.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with last year, when heavy rain postponed the finish
for six months and shortened the event to 54 holes, Thursday's
conditions were a picnic under partly sunny skies, although the
wind picked up as the day progressed. Most of the best scores came
at Pebble Beach. Quigley, who lost his full-time playing privileges
last year, also played at Pebble Beach. Charles Raulerson, who was
tied for fourth at 68, had the best score at Spyglass Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans ventured to Spyglass Hill to follow the glamour group
of Woods, who was paired with the actor Kevin Costner and O'Meara,
who was paired with Ken Griffey Jr. Neither O'Meara (71) nor Woods
(72) was in top form, but the small gallery following Kraft saw
some splendid shots. Starting on the back nine, Kraft built early
momentum with a six-foot birdie putt on No. 10, and he followed
that with his best shot of the day _ a 50-foot birdie putt at the
par-3 No. 12. Kraft took that long putt as a sign that things might
go his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm putting well, my attitude is always good, because no
matter what happens, you can always make up for it with a putt,''
he said. ``But if I'm struggling with my putter, I'm frustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft secured his tour card for this year by finishing 94th on
the 1998 money list with $326,571, including a tie for fourth at
the United Airlines Hawaiian Open. His best round last year came at
the PGA Championship, when he set the Sahalee Country Club course
record with a 63. Kraft shot a 73 that Sunday and fell into a tie
for 23d, but the 63 was satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft spent much of November and December having a sore left
shoulder treated after it bothered him for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shoulder is great and the swing is fine,'' Kraft said.
``After the work I put in during the off season, it would be sweet
to win. A lot of mornings I dreaded getting up and working out, but
it all seemed to pay off today.''  &QL;

MAVS, YES MAVS, EYE PLAYOFFS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ After a decade of futility, the clouds no
longer appear dark to the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   The days when this team had a better chance of winning the NBA
draft lottery than winning its share of basketball games seemed to
have passed. Two years of wheeling and dealing by coach/general
manager Don Nelson have the Mavericks entering tonight's season
opener at Seattle with their deepest and most experienced team this
decade, their most scoring muscle since Jason Kidd, Jim Jackson and
Jamal Mashburn were in town and a legitimate chance at making the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the Mavericks' coach and general manager, revamped his
roster this season by bringing in rookie Dirk Nowitzki, adding
veterans John ``Hot Rod'' Williams, Gary Trent and Steve Nash, and
re-signing free agent Cedric Ceballos.
</P>
<P>
   Combining those five with budding all-star Michael Finley,
Samaki Walker, A.C. Green, Shawn Bradley, Hubert Davis, Robert
Pack, Erick Strickland and Chris Anstey fills Nelson with high
expectations for the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're pretty good, but I think we have to prove it,''
Nelson said. ``... Making the playoffs is a goal that we have.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a reasonable goal, considering how deep in the tunnel
this franchise has been this entire decade. Other than a brief
flurry during the 1994-95 season when Kidd, Jackson and Mashburn
led the Mavericks to a 36-win season, the Mavericks have done
nothing but trip over themselves in the 1990s. The decade includes
an 11-win season in 1992-'93 and a 13-win season in 1993-'94.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has the longest running tenure of any of the current
Mavericks players. And he didn't come aboard until the summer of
1996. But Walker likes the crop of players Nelson has assembled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't replace superstars like Jason Kidd, Mashburn, Chris
Gatling and Jim Jackson,'' Walker said. ``Those are all-star
material guys.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I can say that the personalities here of the players are
such that I think we're going to win for the simple fact that we
come out here and work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley has emerged as the Mavericks' go-to player, and he and
Ceballos provide a formidable 1-2 scoring punch. Nowitzki, Nash and
Walker also add scoring strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finley is a future all-star for many years to come, but going
down the roster you don't have too many Finleys on this team,''
Walker said. ``But you do have some players with significant
abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Strickland has noticed the quality of the depth the Mavericks
have on their roster, and says it makes for some competitive
practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody goes out every day in practice and challenges each
other, and it makes us better,'' he said. ``Practice has been very
intense. We get after each other, we're very physical, and we push
each other each day. I think that's what's going to make us better
in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Mavericks attempt to change their losing ways, and be one
of the eight teams in the Western Conference to advance to the
playoffs, they received no help from the NBA schedule-maker during
this 13-week, 50-game season. Nine of their first 11 games are on
the road. And the two home games are against two of this year's top
NBA title contenders, Utah and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``My preparation to them really is that there aren't going to be
a lot of practice days for the entire season, so we're going to
have to make adjustments as we go,'' Nelson said. ``We're going to
be either in the air \Rtraveling\S or on the floor playing ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few days off, so prepare themselves mentally.
I've prepared them physically, so they're ready to roll.''

BRONC RIDER'S FAST COMEBACK NOT ADVISED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRETT HOFFMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When the plane started going down, Scott
Johnston never thought he was going to die. After all, the trees
were there to break the fall of the single-engine plane carrying De
Leon resident Johnston and three other cowboys to a rodeo in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The crash of the Cessna 210 killed the pilot and left Johnston
with a broken back. But the 25-year-old Australian never thought he
wasn't going to compete again. And despite advice from friends and
physicians that he has come back too early, Johnston is not only
competing but is among the leaders in saddle bronc riding as the
semifinal round starts today in the Southwestern Exposition and
Livestock Show Rodeo at Will Rogers Memorial Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no use in letting fear getting in the road,'' Johnston
said. ``When the plane started going down, it wasn't as bad as
you'd think.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were praying all of the way down. I didn't think we were
going to die. I thought that we would get through it. We first hit
treetops, and the impact of hitting the trees is what caused our
injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston underwent surgery to fuse two vertebrae in his lower
back. A rod was inserted to solidify the fusion, and the recovery
time from such a procedure can be two to six months, said Tandy
Freeman, a physician with the Justin Sportsmedicine on-site medical
team at the rodeo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been advised not to ride,'' Freeman said. ``The risk he
takes now is not giving the fusion enough time to get solid. It's
pretty impressive that he's riding.''
</P>
<P>
   The crash occurred on Nov. 4. En route to a San Francisco rodeo
were Johnston; Marvin Garrett, a four-time world bareback riding
champion; Mark Garrett, also a world champion in bareback riding;
and Thad Bothwell, who had already secured a berth in his first
National Finals Rodeo in bull riding.
</P>
<P>
   The plane ran out of gas and went down near Lodi, Calif.. Pilot
Johnny Morris, a retired rodeo cowboy who died in a hospital two
weeks after the crash, had attempted to switch the fuel lines over
to a reserve tank. But after the fuel-tank transfer malfunctioned,
the plane crashed into treetops.
</P>
<P>
   After the plane snapped through the trees, fell to the ground
and caught on fire, the five men scrambled out of the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Garrett escaped almost unscathed and is competing in the
Fort Worth Rodeo. But his elder brother, Marvin, underwent surgery
to fuse three vertebrae in his back and secure his broken right arm
with a plate, and his return is indefinite. Bothwell underwent
surgery to fuse two vertebrae and to remove a disk; his return also
is indefinite.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston might not have been on that plane had he not had
trouble with his work visa last season, which kept him from
returning to the United States from Australia. He eventually worked
out the problem and returned to the North American rodeo circuit
last July.
</P>
<P>
   He was trying to compete in as many rodeos as possible to
accumulate enough money to qualify for the National Finals Rodeo in
December. Cowboys sometimes travel by small plane if they are
competing in more than one rodeo in a week.
</P>
<P>
   When the plane crashed, Johnston was en route to the Grand
National Rodeo, the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association's last
major regular-season show, and was in striking distance of making
the National Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Johnston, a former National Finals Rodeo
average winner, has turned in attention-grabbing scores of 78 and
75 and has qualified for a semifinal round, which is scheduled
during performances this afternoon through Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnston continues his pace, he will advance to Sunday
night's final. For Johnston, who now is ranked second overall with
a combined score of 153 on two rides, the Stock Show Rodeo was his
first outing since the crash.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first ride was a little awkward because I had to get new
equipment after the crash,'' Johnston said. ``All of my equipment
was burned in the plane crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston began competing again Jan. 24 at the Stock Show Rodeo
and aggressively spurred his saddle bronc to pick up extra points.
His score of 78 finished third in the first round and he earned
$1,611.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little pain during my first ride,'' Johnston said.
``But several days later, I got on another horse in Rapid City,
S.D., and I didn't have any problems at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's wife, Jane, said she feels confident that her husband
has not returned too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was God that got him out of that plane and it was God that
is still watching over him,'' she said. ``We've prayed after the
accident and have relied on God to heal him. I believe that he has
the ability to win and he will be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Garrett said he is concerned about Johnston's rapid
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dang sure don't like it,'' Garrett said. ``If it was me, I'd
wait until I get 100 percent. But I hope that it works well for
him.''

WRITERS CUT DEAL FOR SLICE OF SONY MOVIE PROFITS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Nearly three dozen of Hollywood's top
screenwriters reached an unprecedented deal Thursday with Sony
Corp. that will pay them a significant cut of profits if their
films are hits.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was instigated by 34 writers who have won or been
nominated for 21 Academy Awards. Each will now deliver at least one
script to Sony over the next four years at the fee from their last
film, but can earn much more if their movies turn into box office
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony grasped the concept that writers, just like stars and
directors, should be earning more on successful films,'' said Ron
Bass, whose credits include ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' ``The
studio really looked at it from the point of fairness. We're
grateful to them for finally putting their money where their mouth
is instead of just offering lip service about partnerships with
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic agreement gives writers 2 percent of Sony's gross
receipts from a movie -- the company's 50 percent cut of box office
and ancillary sources like home video -- after the studio has
recouped production, distribution and marketing costs but before
distribution fees and profit participations to stars and directors.
</P>
<P>
   What's distinctive about the agreement is Sony's willingness to
allocate profits to writers before figuring its net, or overall
profits, something done currently for only a few powerful players
like ``Titanic'' director-writer James Cameron. Most current deals
call for top writers to receive ``net'' points from studios, but
studios have been criticized for decades for turning a profitable
movie into a ``net'' loser by adding ancillary costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It galls us that we can write a very successful script and see
the net points become worthless,'' said Nicholas Kazan, whose
credits include ``Reversal of Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's formula will pay off only on successful films. For
example, if a movie costs $60 million to produce and $30 million to
distribute and market, then takes in $240 million in worldwide box
office, Sony's cut would be about $120 million and its gross profit
would be a fairly impressive $30 million. Under that example, a
writer with sole credit would be paid an additional $600,000, or 2
percent of Sony's gross profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not come in with a proposal that would significantly
alter the economics of the business,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say the pact will give Sony an edge over
rivals in attracting strong screenplays without exposing the studio
to huge additional payouts. Daniel Petrie Jr., executive director
of the Writers Guild of America West, predicts the deal could
encourage the other major studios to improve their deals for
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bet the other studios will realize that the top
writers are going to want to work at Sony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also has agreed to offer the same profit-participation
arrangement for the next seven years to any writer who either: gets
nominated for an Academy Award or Writers Guild Award; gets paid at
least $750,000 for work on one screenplay; or receives payment of
$1 million for a spec script.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that it's a good deal for us,'' said Amy Pascal,
president of Sony's Columbia Pictures. ``We will have a better
selection of scripts from some of the best writers in the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of approaching a studio grew out of informal Thursday
night get-togethers that started in June among Kazan, Bass, Frank
Pierson (``Dog Day Afternoon''), Phil Alden Robinson (``Field of
Dreams'') and Tom Schulman (``Dead Poets Society''). Robert Towne,
acknowledged as one of Hollywood's best script doctors, played a
crucial role in suggesting a partnership with studios and
preliminary talks began several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Towne also said at one of those meetings, Get gross points and
respect will follow,'' Kazan said.
</P>
<P>
   Petrie said being frozen out of gross points has been a longtime
source of frustration for writers. ``There are lots of reasons but
part of it is that the writing deal is so early in the process that
you're often not even sure if it's going to lead to a movie,'' he
added. ``This agreement certainly levels the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is also distinctive in several other ways, including
the number of writers involved, the willingness of Sony and the
writers to go public about the pact and the lack of advance leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that screenwriters can keep a secret,'' Kazan said.
``It really has been the town's best-kept secret,'' Pascal agreed.

   LOS ANGELES -- Nearly three dozen of Hollywood's top
screenwriters reached an unprecedented deal Thursday with Sony
Corp. that will pay them a significant cut of profits if their
films are hits.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was instigated by 34 writers who have won or been
nominated for 21 Academy Awards. Each will now deliver at least one
script to Sony over the next four years at the fee from their last
film, but can earn much more if their movies turn into box office
hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sony grasped the concept that writers, just like stars and
directors, should be earning more on successful films,'' said Ron
Bass, whose credits include ``My Best Friend's Wedding.'' ``The
studio really looked at it from the point of fairness. We're
grateful to them for finally putting their money where their mouth
is instead of just offering lip service about partnerships with
writers.''
</P>
<P>
   The basic agreement gives writers 2 percent of Sony's gross
receipts from a movie -- the company's 50 percent cut of box office
and ancillary sources like home video -- after the studio has
recouped production, distribution and marketing costs but before
distribution fees and profit participations to stars and directors.
</P>
<P>
   What's distinctive about the agreement is Sony's willingness to
allocate profits to writers before figuring its net, or overall
profits, something done currently for only a few powerful players
like ``Titanic'' director-writer James Cameron. Most current deals
call for top writers to receive ``net'' points from studios, but
studios have been criticized for decades for turning a profitable
movie into a ``net'' loser by adding ancillary costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It galls us that we can write a very successful script and see
the net points become worthless,'' said Nicholas Kazan, whose
credits include ``Reversal of Fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Sony's formula will pay off only on successful films. For
example, if a movie costs $60 million to produce and $30 million to
distribute and market, then takes in $240 million in worldwide box
office, Sony's cut would be about $120 million and its gross profit
would be a fairly impressive $30 million. Under that example, a
writer with sole credit would be paid an additional $600,000, or 2
percent of Sony's gross profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not come in with a proposal that would significantly
alter the economics of the business,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say the pact will give Sony an edge over
rivals in attracting strong screenplays without exposing the studio
to huge additional payouts. Daniel Petrie Jr., executive director
of the Writers Guild of America West, predicts the deal could
encourage the other major studios to improve their deals for
writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would bet the other studios will realize that the top
writers are going to want to work at Sony,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony also has agreed to offer the same profit-participation
arrangement for the next seven years to any writer who either: gets
nominated for an Academy Award or Writers Guild Award; gets paid at
least $750,000 for work on one screenplay; or receives payment of
$1 million for a spec script.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is that it's a good deal for us,'' said Amy Pascal,
president of Sony's Columbia Pictures. ``We will have a better
selection of scripts from some of the best writers in the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of approaching a studio grew out of informal Thursday
night get-togethers that started in June among Kazan, Bass, Frank
Pierson (``Dog Day Afternoon''), Phil Alden Robinson (``Field of
Dreams'') and Tom Schulman (``Dead Poets Society''). Robert Towne,
acknowledged as one of Hollywood's best script doctors, played a
crucial role in suggesting a partnership with studios and
preliminary talks began several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Towne also said at one of those meetings, Get gross points and
respect will follow,'' Kazan said.
</P>
<P>
   Petrie said being frozen out of gross points has been a longtime
source of frustration for writers. ``There are lots of reasons but
part of it is that the writing deal is so early in the process that
you're often not even sure if it's going to lead to a movie,'' he
added. ``This agreement certainly levels the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is also distinctive in several other ways, including
the number of writers involved, the willingness of Sony and the
writers to go public about the pact and the lack of advance leaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears that screenwriters can keep a secret,'' Kazan said.
``It really has been the town's best-kept secret,'' Pascal agreed.

L.A. MAYOR SEEKS CHIMP'S FATHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors note: Richard Riordan is the mayor of Los Angeles.) 
BY LISA WEISS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The paternity of the Los Angeles Zoo's newborn
chimpanzee, Toshi, remained a mystery Thursday despite the
sleuthing of Detective Richard Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor was at the zoo Thursday to help debut endangered
reptiles that were confiscated from smugglers by the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service. But he couldn't resist a side trip to the
chimpanzee exhibit to visit the zoo's other new addition, who was
born over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Handlers didn't know the mother, Yoshiko, was pregnant and don't
have a clue to who the father is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to find the father and have the city sue him for
child support,'' Riordan said jokingly as he joined other zoo
visitors to look in on mother and chimp.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also joked that he knows the identity of the father:
Toto. That chimp is his favorite at the zoo, a Riordan spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials, however, are less sure. They said they a DNA test
will determine whom baby Toshi calls Daddy, but that won't happen
until mama Yoshi allows handlers to get close enough to her baby,
said zoo director Manuel Mollinedo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have DNA samples from all of the adults, but we won't be
able to get one from the baby for three or four months, when she
can be apart from her mother,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mollinedo said the father could be a juvenile chimpanzee that
was not believed to be capable of siring or another chimp that had
undergone a faulty vasectomy.
</P>
<P>
   The confiscated reptiles, such as Komodo dragons with their
prehistoric appearance and Madagascar radiated tortoises with
brilliantly colored shells, are prized as additions to private
menageries. These reptiles, on loan to the zoo, can fetch up to
$30,000 on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   Mollinedo explained to Riordan the Komodo dragon's habit of
eating its own kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kind of like the City Council?'' he quipped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't say that,'' Riordan replied.
</P>
<P>
   The reptiles are indigenous to specific, isolated habitats in
far-flung places around the globe, and their species are nearing
extinction. Now that they are at the zoo, they can be bred with
animals at other zoos.
</P>
<P>
   They are staying at the zoo until the criminal cases against the
smugglers have been decided.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors can see the animals in surroundings zoo officials say
will be improved with money from Proposition CC, a citywide measure
that passed in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of embarrassing,'' Mollinedo said. ``When you see
our reptile house, it's very run-down. It's very decrepit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In two years, we are going to have one of the best reptile
houses in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Zoo was chosen as a home for the reptiles
because Russ Smith, the zoo's curator of reptiles, has worked
closely with the Fish and Wildlife Service on conservation issues,
Mollinedo said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the one person I can credit with establishing our
credibility with that very important agency,'' he said.

MARATHONER-LAWMAKERS NOW SPRINT FOR THE FINISH LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``It mystifies me,'' said former Sen. Bob Dole,
sympathizing with old Republican colleagues enmeshed in President
Clinton's impeachment trial. ``Clinton created the problem, and we
got the blame.''
</P>
<P>
   His brief comment, outside a legislative hearing well removed
from the trial, had the ring of political epitaph as the Senate
court clearly pressed Thursday toward having the arduous proceeding
run just one more week and not a hear-ye or a motion longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should at least let us have Monica Lewinsky here live,''
one House prosecutor pleaded before the court. But the senators sat
silent in their seats, preparing a firm bipartisan rebuff _ a
cross-aisle shudder of sorts _ at the very invitation that they
personally eye ``the demeanor, the temperament, the spontaneity''
of the former White House intern with whom the president
misbehaved.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-to-30 vote barring live testimony from Ms. Lewinsky in
the Senate chamber closely paralleled the public's polled attitudes
against any fresh spectacle. With the vote, there was a sense in
the Capitol of the court's inevitably rounding into the homestretch
of a yearlong national steeplechase, of members' finally securing
the chamber against the tabloidization of Senate dignity.
</P>
<P>
   Out in the corridors, the chief prosecutor, Rep. Henry J. Hyde,
was sounding increasingly weary as he coined a new word _
``backlashy'' _ that echoed Dole's frustration at how the public
seems to be blaming the Republican Party more than the misbehaving
president for the continuing impeachment ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton's acquittal widely expected, the House prosecutors
were nevertheless showing considerable fight to the finish. They
enlisted the Senate's Republican majority to rebuff the Clinton
defense team's motion for advance notice of which videotaped
excerpts from witness depositions the prosecutors will present in
Saturday's court session.
</P>
<P>
   Approval of the motion would have allowed the White House to
better prepare for the video ``duel of snippets'' that the
president's lawyers predict.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is none of your damn business,'' said one prosecutor,
Rep. James E. Rogan of California, happily crediting a California
jurist for his riposte as Republicans beamed and laughed. As he won
the point, the proceeding was suddenly interrupted by a man in the
public gallery who stood and angrily bellowed, ``God Almighty, take
the vote and get it over with!''
</P>
<P>
   Neatly dressed and trimly bearded, the intruder departed with a
smile of satisfaction, hustled out in the clutch of security guards
even as Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist gaveled for his
banishment. The shouted plea from above seemed unnecessary, as the
majority leader, Sen. Trent Lott, emphasized throughout the day
that the proceeding was now firmly positioned for no more surprises
and a finish by Friday of next week, as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe even a day sooner, the Senate leader suddenly began
suggesting, sounding like a sea captain holding out the promise of
an extra grog ration to a crew grown weary of the bounding main of
impeachment. Lott seemed unflappable as he handled a few unexpected
objections and explained the most significant of Thursday's votes:
the one allowing video excerpts from the depositions of three
witnesses, among them Ms. Lewinsky. In the long year of scandal
investigation, this will be the first time she is seen testifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will make their case more understandable,'' Lott,
speaking after the session, said of the prosecutors' plans for
Lewinsky excerpts. Then he paused and added with a bright-eyed
smile, ``And, frankly, more interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tune in, one of the prosecutors advised, although this latest
benchmark in the sex-and-mendacity story will begin sometime after
10 a.m. on a Saturday, not exactly prime time for a nation measured
as increasingly fed up with the subject.
</P>
<P>
   A tinge of approaching deliverance was in the Capitol air as the
Senate majority readied the votes that would finally dash the hopes
of their House colleagues for some larger and longer trial of the
president. The opening prayer was that the senators henceforth be
gifted with the ``wise and listening heart'' of Solomon.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., seemed off on an understandably
wistful tangent when he voted with the Democrats for a short-cut
move to the trial's climactic stage: final arguments and then
balloting on the articles of impeachment. He instantly realized his
error, corrected his vote to a booming ``no'' and added a double
thumbs-down for good measure as the idea failed.
</P>
<P>
   Burns drew laughs and backslaps from colleagues at the
felicitous urge to finish. Just one more week, the court seemed to
exult after a month in mute passivity. The day's disputes by the
trial attorneys sounded more than familiar and had a lulling
quality, even when they touched upon sex.
</P>
<P>
   When Gregory B. Craig, special White House counsel, asked how
America could ever protect its children from embarrassing details
that might surface in those dueling snippets on Saturday, two of
Rehnquist's four young grandchildren could be seen snoozing
unscandalized in the gallery. Earlier, all four watched, proudly
smiling in fascination, as their grandfather arrived in his
gold-striped robe, gaveled the place quiet and once more intoned,
``The Senate will convene as a court of impeachment.''

SENATE REJECTS LIVE TESTIMONY FROM LEWINSKY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate turned down a request Thursday by House
prosecutors to allow live testimony from Monica Lewinsky in the
impeachment trial of President Clinton, but did agree to hear
videotaped excerpts from her latest deposition.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 70-30, with 25 Republicans joining with all 45
Democrats, the senators rejected the motion to allow Lewinsky's
appearance in the Senate chamber, which many GOP lawmakers had
feared would turn the Senate trial into a spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   But moments later the lawmakers approved a motion by a vote of
65-35 _ with 10 Democrats voting for it and two Republicans against
_ that would give the public its first glimpse of the young woman
testifying. The videotaped excerpts of her most recent deposition
will be played by prosecutors in their closing arguments Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also agreed that the 13-member Republican prosecution
team can present videotaped excerpts from depositions taken earlier
this week from Clinton friend Vernon Jordan and White House aide
Sidney Blumenthal. However, they rejected an appeal by the White
House to be given advance notice of what portions of the videotapes
the prosecution plans to use in their final arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to deny Lewinsky's live appearance set the stage
for a final vote next week on whether to convict or acquit Clinton
of the charges of perjury and obstruction of justice outlined in
the two articles of impeachment against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a critical day and guarantees now that we're
moving to the final phase of the impeachment trial,'' Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., told reporters after the
votes. ``Barring some dramatic interruption, we will be through
(next) Thursday or not later than Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   The vote against Lewinsky's live testimony disappointed House
prosecutors. But they were elated with the opportunity to air parts
of her videotaped deposition, saying that it would give not only
the lawmakers but the public a chance to ``judge for themselves''
the young woman's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   The vote to allow the videotapes in the Senate chamber marked a
significant moment in the yearlong sex scandal that led to the
first impeachment trial of a president in 131 years. Until now, the
public has only read and heard audio tapes of Lewinsky's personal
accounts of her relationship with the president and her view of
whether he asked her to lie about it and tried to cover it up by
influencing the testimony of potential witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Although the taped depositions are expected to provide little if
anything in the way of new evidence, prosecutors are convinced that
if senators and the public can only watch Lewinsky reaffirm and
expand on testimony she had already given 23 times, they will be
stunned by what one lawmaker called ``her youth and
vulnerability.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., a member of the House prosecution
team, said her deposition would provide ``the full flavor'' of how
the president ``took advantage of this young woman'' and tried to
enlist her help in covering up their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just invite everyone to stay tuned on Saturday,'' said
Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., another House prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some Republicans who have suggested that prosecutors
have yet to build a credible case that Clinton intentionally
committed perjury and obstructed justice, say the Lewinsky
videotape could change some minds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone will see their daughter or see their sister when they
look at that videotape,'' said Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders, however, said the videotape shows only ``a
mature and articulate young woman'' who set out to seduce the
president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely nothing new there. We've read it all
before, we've heard it all before,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing against live witness testimony and the public release
of videotapes, White House special counsel Greg Craig warned the
Senate that the public could react angrily just as it did when the
House released independent counsel Kenneth Starr's detailed and
sordid report on the Clinton-Lewinsky relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should learn a lesson from America's experience with what
happened in the House,'' Craig said. ``More is not always better.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig told the senators that nothing was to be gained by having
Lewinsky testify in person or allowing prosecutors to present
``snippets'' from her deposition. He said, however, that the White
House would not object to allowing the use of deposition
transcripts in closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``You already know the facts. You have already read what they
have had to say on many different occasions. And you have already
seen and read their most recent testimony under oath,'' Craig told
the senators. ``It simply can no longer be credibly argued that you
need testimony from these witnesses to flesh out the factual record
or to resolve conflicts or to fill in the evidentiary gaps, or to
look the witnesses in the eyes and assess their credibility.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view ... the Senate has leaned over backwards to
accommodate the managers. We believe it is time for the Senate to
say it's time to vote (on whether to convict Clinton and remove him
from office),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most senators appeared to agree Thursday that despite their best
efforts, House prosecutors will not get the 67 votes they need to
convict Clinton and remove him from office. They also seemed to
agree that there is not enough support from senators on either side
of the aisle for a ``finding of fact'' motion that would allow them
to essentially declare Clinton guilty of wrongdoing but not kick
him out of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the finding of facts issue is probably dead,'' said
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb. He said he and a number of other
Republicans opposed it because they felt it would be
unconstitutional under the rules governing impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also suggested that he was no longer willing to delay the
end of the trial just so Republicans could keep Clinton from
``gloating,'' as one GOP senator put it, over having been acquitted
of the impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that any president that has been impeached and
tried by the Senate, even though he may not be removed, could feel
like he's gotten off scot-free,'' Lott said. ``I do think it's time
we get to a vote and we move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan being worked out now, the prosecution and defense
will begin closing arguments Saturday and wrap them up on Monday.
After that, senators would begin their deliberations, which could
last up to three days.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic proposal that's attracting attention from
Republicans would call for the Senate to adjourn the trial for a
brief period following the deliberations to vote on a resolution of
censure against Clinton. Then the trial would resume and the Senate
would hold a final vote on whether to remove Clinton from office.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Democrats and Republicans had hoped to present a more
bipartisan front in the aftermath of the vote along party lines
last week that allowed prosecutors to take new testimony in the
case. The vote against having live witnesses on the floor was
clearly bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas joined 24 of her
Republican colleagues who voted with the Democrats not to allow
Lewinsky to testify in person. Most of those Republicans said they
had learned all they needed from simply watching Lewinsky's
videotaped deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, however, voted in favor of
having Lewinsky appear live, noting that the Senate had never held
an impeachment trial without hearing from witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gramm and Hutchison voted in favor of allowing House
prosecutors to play videotaped excerpts of Lewinsky's deposition.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Offering specifics about total job cuts in Washington
state for the first time Thursday, The Boeing Co. said it expects
to trim 24,000 to 28,000 positions by the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the new figure includes 7,500
cuts _ either by layoffs or attrition _ that occurred between
January 1998 and mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   The company had previously said it would lose up to 48,000 jobs
across the United States between June 1998 and December 2000. But
it never said how many it expected to lose here. Conte said
Thursday that between 50 and 60 percent of the total, and probably
closer to 60 percent, would be in this state.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's employment in Washington had already shrunk from
104,000 last June to 96,500 by Jan. 14. The new forecast pegs the
total at the end of next year at 75,000 to 80,000 _ about what it
was in mid-1996.
</P>
<P>
   Though the forecast job cuts are fewer than some had feared, the
number is more than the state's Office of the Forecast Council had
thought. Their forecast, issued in November, projected losses of
20,700 through the end of next year. Bret Bertolin, senior economic
forecaster, said those numbers would have to be revised.
</P>
<P>
   Also for the first time, Boeing's Conte said that 3,000 to 4,000
of the jobs ultimately lost would be at the Long Beach, Calif.,
division, where the company is phasing out production of the MD-80,
MD-90, MD-11 jet transports. Employment at Wichita, which supplies
parts for assembly lines here, ``will see a decline by at least a
couple thousand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's layoff machinery continues to grind, spitting out
60-day warn notices, followed by 14-day notices of impending
layoff.
</P>
<P>
   The company reports no figures of how many of these notices it
has given out, but the two big unions, which together represent
about two-thirds of employees, do report them. The International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers said 720 members
were laid off Jan. 29, and that 1,054 are holding 60-day notices.
The Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association reported
191 layoffs of SPEEA-represented workers Jan. 29 and that 1,025 are
holding 60-day notices.
</P>
<P>
   The Machinists and SPEEA are both gearing up with programs to
help members retrain and find jobs. SPEEA plans a Job Fair in the
Kingdome March 16-17 with booths from more than 300 companies,
including, they hope, a certain company from France: Airbus
Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not confirmed,'' said SPEEA contract administrator Rich
Plunkett. ``We're still working on it.''

   NEW YORK _ Wall Street firms that rescued the giant hedge fund
Long-Term Capital Management last fall learned at a gathering
Thursday that they had made a modest profit on their investment and
that the hedge fund was not as risky as it once was. But hopes of
getting their money back quickly were dashed, according to
executives close to the unusual gathering.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since late September, when the firms injected
$3.6 billion to save Long-Term Capital from bankruptcy, top
executives from Merrill Lynch, Goldman, Sachs, Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and other consortium members
discussed the Greenwich, Conn., hedge fund's performance and
debated its future.
</P>
<P>
   People who attended said that all of the consortium members
reaffirmed their commitment to the fund, at least for the immediate
future.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting came amid a swirl of speculation about the stability
of the consortium and talk of a rift between the fund's founding
partners, led by John W. Meriwether, and the leaders of the Wall
Street banks and brokerage firms that now control 90 percent of the
fund's assets.
</P>
<P>
   At least two of the 14 consortium members have let it be known
that they want to cash out their investments in the fund as soon as
possible. But one person close to the discussions said it was
unlikely that any investors would get their money back before next
fall at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Meriwether and his colleagues have recently visited
institutional investors around the world to present their view of
why the fund almost collapsed five months ago. The partners have
also explored the possibility of raising new money from wealthy
investors, with an eye to insuring the fund's survival even if some
or all of the Wall Street firms pull out.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital partners have also voiced suspicions,
including in a Jan. 24 article in The New York Times Magazine, that
some unnamed Wall Street brokerage houses, including at least one
that is part of the rescue consortium, had actively sought to
undercut Long-Term Capital in September by trading against it in
financial markets. Some Wall Street executives said Meriwether's
suggestions had soured the relationship between the fund and its
rescuers.
</P>
<P>
   But people informed about the meeting Thursday at the offices of
Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom, the law firm that brokered
the deal to save the hedge fund, said no changes in the fund's
ownership were likely in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just no one out there with $4 billion who's ready to
jump in,'' one person said. Meriwether did not attend the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The banks and brokerage houses have appointed representatives to
work at Long-Term Capital's offices and oversee its investments.
But the meeting Thursday was described as the first time senior
executives from the bailout firms gathered to get a firsthand
briefing about its performance.
</P>
<P>
   Among the attendees were: Herbert M. Allison Jr., Merrill's
president; Peter F. Karches, Morgan Stanley president, and John A.
Thain, Goldman, Sachs' chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   They learned that from the time they had invested in Long-Term
Capital until the end of last year, the value of their investments
rose by 11 percent after subtracting fees and expenses, people
close to the fund said. The portfolio continued to post small gains
in January.
</P>
<P>
   The executives were also told that the risk profile of the
portfolio had been ``substantially'' reduced. That means both that
the stock and bond market investments the fund has are safer than
before, and that the amount of money it borrows to purchase
securities has been reduced. But one person close to the discussion
said that risk reduction ``still has further to go'' before people
are satisfied.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The meeting came as Long-Term Capital's partners, led by
Meriwether, have begun a campaign to rehabilitate the fund's
battered reputation. Partners have visited existing investors in
Europe, the Americas and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   People involved with the fund said the partners had made about
20 separate presentations that lifted the veil of secrecy that has
long shielded the fund's basic trading strategies even from its own
investors.
</P>
<P>
   During that road show, the partners explained in detail the
reasons for its near collapse last fall. They also sought to
demonstrate that in better times the amount of borrowed money the
fund used was not unusual by the standards of big banks or
brokerage houses, though they acknowledged that leverage ballooned
to enormous levels _ as much as $100 in borrowed money to $1 in
equity _ as the fund's capital was depleted in the summer and fall.
</P>
<P>
   The partners have also tried to raise new money. They are
worried about the fund's long-term survival, especially amid
rumblings that some members of the consortium are pondering how to
extract their investment, people close to the fund said.
</P>
<P>
   But there's no indication that the fund is close to raising new
money or finding a billionaire backer who could purchase the stakes
held by some or all of the Wall Street firms. A spokesman for the
fund declined to comment.

FEDERAL AUDITORS HIT FOREST SERVICE FOR LAX CONTROL OF LOGGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: Ads Web site in last graf) 
 (rk) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal auditors have found that the Forest Service
frequently fails to assess, prevent or correct environmental damage
from logging on the national forests.
</P>
<P>
   After inspecting 12 timber projects in the field from 1995 to
1998, the Agriculture Department's inspector general found that all
were deficient and that ``immediate corrective action is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   A new report found that the environmental studies required
before logging was approved were poorly done, the rules to protect
streams and wildlife habitat from undue damage during logging were
not followed, and plans to repair some of the harm after logging
were not carried out.
</P>
<P>
   Roger C. Viadero, the inspector general, reported on Jan. 15 to
Mike Dombeck, the agency's chief, that the review found ``numerous
serious deficiencies.'' Agency officials generally agreed with the
report's conclusions and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The problems not only cause lasting harm to publicly owned
natural resources, the report emphasized, but also cost the
taxpayers money because many timber sales are canceled for
environmental reasons, and the government then must pay penalties
to the timber companies for breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
   The report put an official stamp on the kind of complaints that
environmental advocates have lodged with the agency for years, and
it was welcomed by groups that are suing the agency in federal
court seeking a complete halt to logging on federal lands on the
ground that it does more environmental harm than economic good.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an extremely damaging report to the Forest Service's
case because it shows that Forest Service decisions can be based on
inadequate and incomplete research and analysis,'' said Brian
Dunkiel, a lawyer for Friends of the Earth, one of the groups suing
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The forest service said it is already moving to correct the
problems, ordering every regional forester to send special teams
into the woods to make sure its rules are being enforced
</P>
<P>
   ``This audit is healthy and it is representative of folks'
growing concern about how their forests are managed,'' said
Christopher Wood, the senior policy aid to Dombeck. ``We are
stewards of the public's trust as well as their resources, and it
is unacceptable when we don't comply with our own environmental
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   The audit uncovered many problems in the complex paperwork that
accompanies the agency's sales of timber on publicly owned land to
private logging companies. The Forest Service prepares at least
2,000 environmental assessments each year, in which it is required
to document in detail virtually every possible environmental
consequence of each sale. In 1997, the agency sold more than 3
billion board feet of timber for nearly $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The report also disclosed problems in how the logging was
actually carried out. It documented instances of logging too close
to streams, and other cases in which too many trees were felled or
proper steps were not taken to prevent soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the audit was under way, local officials moved to
correct some of the problems the inspectors found, halting several
timber sales because surveys of endangered species had not been
done and because too many trees were being cut.
</P>
<P>
   That proved costly for the agency, which in one such case had to
pay $650,000 to logging companies for breach of contract. Over the
years, cancellations due to improper environmental planning have
cost the agency tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report included several specific examples of the kind of
problems that the auditors believe are pervasive.
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinch Ranger District in Virginia, where clear-cutting
was usually prohibited within 50 feet of a stream, agency
biologists doubled the buffer strip at one site to protect water
quality because there were many species of endangered mussels
downstream. But inspectors found a clear-cut spot within 15 feet of
the stream, and a survey found that in six of nine spots examined
the buffer strips ranged from 13 feet to 85 feet. The result was
excessive sediment in the water.
</P>
<P>
   In the Laurentian Ranger District in Minnesota, the agency
permitted a 50-acre clearcut even though 30 additional acres were
clearcut on adjacent county land. That oversight meant that the
assessment of cumulative environmental harm, a required document,
was flawed. Similar flaws were found repeatedly at other locations.
</P>
<P>
   In eight out of 12 cases examined, biological evaluations did
not consider all the imperiled species that were known or expected
to live in the forest where logging was to occur. The auditors
found that the evaluations did not consider 364 of the 436
threatened, endangered or sensitive species that could be found in
those areas. One project was described as improving the habitat for
ruffled grouse, and its evaluation stated that no imperiled species
were found there, while the auditors found that 127 threatened,
endangered or sensitive species were either known or likely to live
in the area.

SLAIN MAN IS REMEMBERED AS SHY AND HARD-WORKING
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The photographs of Amadou Diallo show a slight,
smiling man. In one picture, he is shirtless, flexing his muscles;
in another, he wears sunglasses, and jauntily props up a foot on a
stoop. Always, the gentle grin is there.
</P>
<P>
   Those pictures, his family, friends and neighbors said, captured
Diallo's personality. ``To say he was nice is not an
exaggeration,'' his roommate Momodou Kujabi, said. ``I would rather
it had been me'' who was shot, he said. ``This guy was better than
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in the hours after Diallo was killed by police
gunfire, Kujabi and other men from Diallo's native country, Guinea,
gathered outside his apartment building in the Soundview section of
the Bronx to express quiet outrage and make grim preparations to
collect his body, have it washed in the Islamic tradition and send
it home.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, 22, emigrated two and half years ago from Guinea, in
West Africa. A member of the Fulani ethnic group, he left the
village of Lelouma, where much of his family, including his mother,
still lives. She was notified Thursday, relatives said. His father
was out of the country and could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Diallo, the president of the Guinean Association of
America, said most Guineans were emigrating because of instability
in parts of West Africa. Diallo, who is not related to Amadou
Diallo, said: ``A lot of things are happening in Africa, some bad
things. Fighting is going on in my country, Sierra Leone, and
Guinea Bissau.''
</P>
<P>
   Amadou Diallo was thus following a well-worn path, and he
quickly landed in a community of Guineans who had settled in and
around the Soundview section. First, he lived with his uncle,
Mamadou Diallo, on Wheeler Avenue. A year ago, he moved down the
street to share an apartment with two cousins, Modousalieu Diallo
and Abdou Rahman Diallo, and Kujabi.
</P>
<P>
   Five or six months ago, Modousalieu Diallo moved to Detroit, and
he returned Thursday, his face grim, to the cramped apartment
stuffed with sofas, a large television, a display case for dishware
and a poster of Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   The three roommates rarely saw each other, because they all
worked so many hours, striving to make their way in a new country.
Amadou Diallo, who peddled socks, gloves, videotapes and other
goods on 14th Street in Manhattan, usually left each day by noon,
and did not return until midnight. ``All he did was go to work and
come home,'' said Abdou, his cousin and roommate.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and relatives said that Diallo had no reason to fear the
police and that he was in the country legally. They said he was shy
and soft-spoken, that his English was good but he spoke slowly,
with a stutter.
</P>
<P>
   Mamadou Diallo said he thought his nephew also wanted to bring
more family members here. ``You have a good life here, you need to
bring your family,'' the uncle said. ``I know he had that in
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   When Diallo was not working, he often sat, alone or with
friends, out on his stoop; it made him something of a fixture on
the block. Each morning, he greeted Barry Jenkins, a neighbor, with
a smile. Jenkins said he had never learned the young man's name,
yet he was devastated when he learned it was he who had been
killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't never seen him bother nobody,'' Jenkins, 53, said.
</P>
<P>
   Kujabi described his roommate as an avid sports fan who loved
soccer and basketball, and had recently decided to support the
Knicks instead of the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo, a Muslim, always prayed five times a day, Kujabi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's pious,'' he said. Then he added, ``It's just an innocent
life taken by mistake, or by will.''

3 OF THE 4 OFFICERS WERE ALSO INVOLVED IN OTHER SHOOTINGS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three of the four plainclothes officers who shot a
Bronx man to death early Thursday had been involved in other
shootings, one of which is still under investigation, police said.
</P>
<P>
   All four officers _ Edward McMellon, 26, Sean Carroll, 35,
Kenneth Boss, 27, and Richard Murphy, 26 _ have been placed on
administrative duty, a standard department procedure, while the
department investigates the shooting of Amadou Diallo, 22, in the
vestibule of his Soundview apartment building.
</P>
<P>
   The officers, all assigned to the Bronx Street Crimes Unit, an
elite and often dangerous assignment, had been looking for a
suspect in a series of rapes, police said. It remained unclear
Thursday night why the officers shot at Diallo, who died in a
fusillade of 41 bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Boss, who has been on the police force for seven years, is under
investigation in the October 1997 fatal shooting of a man who
police said was menacing people with a shotgun in front of an
apartment building on Sheffield Avenue in East New York, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Boss shot the man, Pat Baily, after Baily
fled into a nearby apartment building. Although it remains unclear
whether Baily was holding a weapon when he was shot, a shotgun was
found next to his body, police said. Baily died of his injuries at
Brookdale Hospital Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting is under investigation by the Brooklyn district
attorney's office, which is trying to ``determine whether there are
issues that need to be resolved by a grand jury,'' said Patrick
Clark, the spokesman for the office.
</P>
<P>
   McMellon, a five-year police veteran, was cleared after shooting
and wounding a man in East New York, Brooklyn, last June. Police
said the man had a loaded 9-millimeter handgun.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who has also been on the force for five years, was
found to have been justified in firing his gun last August on
Wilson Avenue in the Bronx. He said he had fired at a suspect after
hearing a bullet pass over his head. Neither a suspect nor any
weapons were ever recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who has been on the force for four years, has not been
involved in any previous shootings and has never had a complaint
against him lodged with the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   McMellon has received five complaints, while Boss and Carroll
each have received three, said a law enforcement official who spoke
on the condition of anonymity. The official said that none of the
complaints, which ranged from accusations of excessive force to
abuse of authority and racial insensitivity, had been
substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was the only one of the group to have two years'
experience in the Street Crimes unit, whose members are often asked
to search out crimes in progress and to get guns off the street.
</P>
<P>
   Since they joined the unit in October, Murphy has made eight
felony arrests, seven of them for gun possession, and Boss has made
five gun-possession arrests, one for auto theft and one for
narcotics possession.

MENCHU SAYS CRITICS HARBOR POLITICAL AIMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DEBORAH TEDFORD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Texas _ Nobel laureate Rigoberta Menchu said
Thursday that a New York Times story and an anthropologist's book
that report inaccuracies in her autobiography had political
overtones that undermine the human rights movement in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this comes from a political purpose,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Menchu, 50, said the Guatemalan military cooperated with the
Times on a Dec. 15 story that sought to discredit her account of
atrocities in Guatemala.
</P>
<P>
   That story outlined the results of a 10-year study by U.S.
anthropologist David Stoll that found key elements of Menchu's book
were untrue. It also said interviews conducted by Times reporters
corroborated Stoll's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Menchu said the Times used files from Guatemala's Association of
Retired Military Personnel to discredit her. Those files were
withheld from a special United Nations commission investigating the
oppression of indigenous people, but are the focal point of a
soon-to-be-released report denying accounts of the atrocities of
Guatemala's bloody civil war, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Times did not return a call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Menchu became a spokeswoman for the indigenous people of Central
America and an internationally known human rights activist
following publication of ``I, Rigoberta Menchu.'' Largely because
of the book, which tells of her life as an uneducated and oppressed
Maya, she was awarded the 1992 Nobel Peace Prize.
</P>
<P>
   But the Times interviews and Stoll's book found that key
portions of the book were not true. Among their findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ A land dispute central to the book was not a fight between her
father and rich landowners of European descent, but a family
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   _ Menchu was not an uneducated peasant, but actually received a
quality education in a private school.
</P>
<P>
   _ The brother Menchu claimed she saw burned alive by government
troops actually died under far different circumstances unseen by
any family member.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters after a speech before a crowd of about
1,200 at Southwestern University, Menchu would not address the
truth or falsity of specific findings. Instead, she talked of using
``collective memory'' to chronicle historical events and depicted
herself as an actor in the history of the Maya people.
</P>
<P>
   She did, however, criticize the Times story as an attempt to
diminish the problems of the Maya, such as the inability of an
individual to gain clear title to a plot of land, a significant
problem the government should be able to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   She also chastised Stoll and the Times for taking her to task
over her account of her brother's fiery death by saying it is
offensive to suggest that a person should witness the burning death
of a family member.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the finding that she had received a private
education, Menchu replied that she had worked as a servant at the
Belgian-Guatemalan Institute in Guatemala City, but was taught to
read Spanish by the nuns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 16 and a servant. No educational institute gives someone
who cleans the floors a degree, but the nuns did teach me to read
Spanish,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Menchu questioned the timing of the Times article and Stoll's
book, saying they undermined two important reports that will be
released later this month _ by the United Nations and by the
Catholic Church _ cataloging human rights violations in Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   Menchu asserted that the story and the book not only offended
her, but all the indigenous people of Guatemala and Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   Menchu is in Texas for a two-day symposium examining Spain's
cultural legacy in the Americas. University spokesman Eric Van
Danen said it is the Nobel laureate's first public appearance in
the United States since the controversy erupted over her book.

CLIPPERS STRONG IN FRONTCOURT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the bygone daze of Bill Fitch, what a Los
Angeles Clippers player didn't know could hurt his feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that easy communicating with coach Fitch,'' said
center/forward Lorenzen Wright. ``Sometimes, if guys didn't know
something and it meant asking him, they'd decide they'd rather not
know the answer.''
</P>
<P>
   How much difference can a year and new coach Chris Ford make?
Part of the answer will be revealed tonight at the Sports Arena,
where Ford and the Clippers open their 50-game season against the
Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a real gauge,'' said Ford, who has 10 players
returning from last year's team that finished 17-65. ``They've been
great at accepting what we've been teaching. But they have to stay
on this page. If they stay on this page and do the things we've
been working on, our chances of winning will certainly be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who played for Fitch in Boston, has taken a page from his
predecessor's manual on relating to young players, ripped it from
the text and started over.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made a big difference in generating the enthusiasm we
have,'' said point guard Darrick Martin. ``He's much better at
communicating with the players. He'll tell you exactly what he
expects from you.''
</P>
<P>
   Communicating is one thing, talent to make the playoffs is
another.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they exhibited enough requisite pluck and long-term wisdom
to draft 7-foot rookie Michael Olowokandi. Small forward Lamond
Murray appears primed for big numbers in the last season on his
contract. Second-year forward Maurice Taylor is a powerhouse with
star and highlight-reel potential. Another robust forward, Rodney
Rogers, arrived for training camp with offensive-line potential but
continues to drop surplus weight and should be productive.
</P>
<P>
   The aforementioned Wright provides considerable bang for the
buck at both low-post positions, rookie Brian Skinner could be
Charles Oakley on training wheels and undrafted rookie Tyrone Nesby
has a knack for the spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   So . . . the frontcourt is worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   But the backcourt could go directly to cable.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the roll call: Martin, Pooh Richardson, Eric Piatkowski,
James ``Hollywood'' Robinson and Charles ``Spider'' Smith. Each is
a legitimate NBA player and quality citizen, but there's not an
all-star threat in the bunch. Martin and shooting guard Piatkowski
are expected to start tonight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a lot of negative talk about our backcourt,''
Ford said, ``but if they do the things we're trying to do, we'll be
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   What else can the man say?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he can say the arrival of free-agent point guard Sherman
Douglas will, at least, perk up the offense. Douglas, who played
for Ford in Boston and Milwaukee, is a nine-year veteran with
passing and leadership skills. He's not much of a shooter or
defender but was the best playmaker available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sherman is a very fierce competitor,'' Ford said. ``He knows
how to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ford knows how to coach. In seven seasons, his teams are
291-283. Last year in Milwaukee, he possessed an extremely talented
starting lineup, but the disparity between it and his bench was too
much to overcome after three starters were injured.
</P>
<P>
   Ford plans to increase the tempo in L.A., because the Clippers
have several fine athletes with comparable skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (players) said they wanted to run,'' Ford said, ``so
here's their chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Murray and Taylor might be the only Clippers who can
create a scoring opportunity after an offensive set is blown up,
Ford might attempt to generate points from his defense. Much of
training camp was spent teaching his new team to bait the
opposition into a gauntlet of traps.
</P>
<P>
   And young legs will help. The abundance of forward talent will
enable Ford to spread precious minutes during the more brutal
stretches of the condensed schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi should provide an inside presence and flexibility,
allowing Wright to match up against the ruffian power forwards in
the Western Conference. Murray, the early choice as team MVP, can
swing to shooting guard when Ford feels like using his brawnier
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With a move to the Staples Center on the horizon, the Clippers
seem to be on a minor roll. Ford, if given time, could produce a
winner. Olowokandi, Taylor, Skinner, Wright and Murray represent
solid choices on draft day. The next order of business is patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team still has to find its identity,'' Ford said.
</P>
<P>
   Good idea. The old ID rarely has taken the Clippers past the
NBA's playoff bouncers. &UR; !dlim!!end! &QL;

LOUISIANA POLITICIANS SIGN NONAGGRESSION PACT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BATON ROUGE, La. _ Even by the unconventional standards of
Louisiana politics, what happened at the Governor's Mansion here
last Thursday afternoon was more than a bit odd. All eight of the
Louisiana government's statewide elected officers, six Democrats
and two Republicans, sat down together and signed a nonaggression
pact in which they effectively agreed not to campaign against one
another in this year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   They presented the agreement as a high-minded effort to avoid
the bitter partisanship that the public finds so distasteful in
Washington these days. But critics saw it as a me-first exercise in
incumbent protection that undermines both political parties.
</P>
<P>
   While the pact among the signatories is not the same as their
endorsing one another, it has been interpreted that way by many
party loyalists, and the reaction from Republican and Democratic
leaders has ranged from puzzlement to outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not pleased at all,'' said Ben Jeffers, the Democratic
state chairman. ``We've been working hard to convince our officials
that it's a bad idea.'' Jeffers said the pact would hurt
fund-raising and grass-roots organizing, in part by sending a
``signal to the electorate that parties don't matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike G. Francis, the Republican state chairman, said he had
``mixed feelings'' about the agreement. He said it might help the
party achieve its primary goal: re-electing the state's immensely
popular Republican governor, Mike Foster. But Francis acknowledged
that Foster's pledge to stay on the sidelines might make it more
difficult for the party to recruit candidates for other statewide
offices. ``That's the question,'' Francis said, ``and I can't
answer that question right now.''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, partisanship has always meant less in politics
here than in other states. Candidates from both parties run against
one another in open primaries, and leadership positions in the
Legislature are determined more by political philosophy than by
party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The pact became particularly nettlesome for the Democrats when,
on the day after it had been signed, Rep. William J. Jefferson, a
Democrat from New Orleans, announced that he planned to run for
governor against Foster. No other Democrats had declared for the
race, and the Democratic officials who were parties to the
agreement said Jefferson's announcement had caught them by
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Some now worry that the pact may generate a racial backlash.
Jefferson is black, and Democratic leaders are concerned that black
party loyalists will be deeply offended if six white Democratic
leaders stay out of a race that pits a black Democrat against a
white Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a lot to think about along those lines,''
Jefferson said in an interview Thursday, reaffirming plans to run.
``I know in the heat of a race things get very emotional. And there
are Democrats who want to see our party remain strong and
competitive, and they'll be deeply concerned that the person
carrying the party banner at the moment was abandoned by the
Democratic leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Jefferson and Jeffers, the Democratic chairman, said they
believed that some of the signers might withdraw from the pact now
that Jefferson had announced his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Although none of the signers are considered particularly
vulnerable this year, the pact seems to have been driven largely by
their instinct for incumbency protection. It will allow the
68-year-old Foster, a onetime Democrat who has never demonstrated
great partisan loyalty, to concentrate on his own race without
being drawn into down-the-ballot sideshows. And for the six
Democrats, it may provide some protection against any threat posed
by Foster's coattails.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the signers said the significant factors were that
they all worked well together and the public had grown disgusted
with the partisan strife surrounding the impeachment and trial of
President Clinton. All of those interviewed said that Louisiana's
elected officials got along swimmingly these days despite partisan
differences and the congeniality in the Capitol had helped the
state thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up about Washington, and it seemed like an
important statement for us to say, `You know, you can work
together,''' said Lt. Gov. Kathleen Babineaux Blanco, a Democrat.
``It doesn't have to be a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a wealthy businessman who is only the second Republican
to be elected governor here this century, agreed. ``The Republicans
have waited a long time for a Republican governor, and they want
him to be successful,'' he said. ``And you can't be successful if
you're always having partisan fights, a la D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   The agreement says: ``We as a group believe that we should put
the business of Louisiana's citizens ahead of partisan politics. In
this spirit, we would not want partisan political infighting to
stand in the way of Louisiana continuing to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials agree to offer ``mutual help and support so that
we can continue to work as a team during the coming four years,
with the goal of continued prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The signers, in addition to Foster and Blanco, are Secretary of
State W. Fox McKeithen, a Republican, and Attorney General Richard
P. Ieyoub, State Treasurer Ken Duncan, Commissioner of Insurance
James H. Brown, Commissioner of Agriculture Robert F. Odom and
Commissioner of Elections Jerry M. Fowler, all Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the officials declined to say whether they personally
wanted their counterparts re-elected. ``My personal feelings and my
public posture are two different things,'' McKeithen said. ``I
don't think it's relevant to this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   It is only recently that Republicans have gained ground here.
Although 62 percent of the state's voters are registered as
Democrats, the Republicans hold five of seven seats in the U. S.
House in addition to the governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, a bull-necked businessman who is known for his straight
talk, his folksy style and his love of duck hunting, has impressed
many Louisianians by improving the state's fiscal condition while
also finding money to raise teacher salaries and pave highways. In
a poll conducted late last month by Southern Media and Opinion
Research, 78 percent of those questioned, including 76 percent of
Democrats, approved of his job performance. Half of those surveyed
said they planned to vote for him regardless of his opposition.
</P>
<P>
   The governor maintains that he owes some of his success to his
avoidance of partisan feuds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to turn down anybody who wants to be
supportive,'' he said. ``I think you can have as many enemies as
you go looking for.''

PEAK SEASON FOR SUNS HEAD TRAINER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The NBA season is so close at hand you can reach out
and touch it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ouch''.
</P>
<P>
   Squeeze it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Owwwwww''.``''
</P>
<P>
   Smell it. The unmistakable scent of liniment is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, belatedly, ready or not, the Phoenix Suns and 28 other
teams begin a new season, and while no one knows how many games
will sell out, it's expected that training rooms around the league
will be standing room only.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Proski already is a busy man.
</P>
<P>
   Right, Joe?
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' trainer glanced out the window of his small office
that adjoins the training room. ``Excuse me a minute,'' Proski
said, putting the conversation on hold.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient had walked in. Luc Longley's back is bothering
him. The Suns' 7-foot-2 center blames the muscle stiffness on the
drive he recently made from Chicago to Phoenix, his new NBA home.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries are a part of NBA life. They could become a ``way'' of
life during this abbreviated season, especially the first few
weeks, when players play themselves back into shape.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Chapman will miss tonight's opener against the Los Angeles
Clippers. He is nursing a sore hamstring muscle. Tom Gugliotta's
shoulder hurts.
</P>
<P>
   Check around the league. Charlotte has lost Anthony Mason for
the year. Teammate Glen Rice had elbow surgery and may miss half
the season. The New York Nets will start without Rony Seikaly and
Kerry Kittles. Boston's Ron Mercer is nursing a sore knee.
</P>
<P>
   With NBA teams limited to two exhibition games, how many more
sprains and aches and pains can we expect? Fifty games in 90 days.
How well will older players hold up? Danny Manning is the first NBA
player to come back from three reconstructive knee surgeries. How
much should he play? Three nights in a row?
</P>
<P>
   Danny Ainge wonders. He worries like every other coach. He calls
the increased risk of injuries ``scary.''
</P>
<P>
   During Thursday's spirited workout, Chapman hustled across the
court. Planting himself in front of rookie guard Toby Bailey, Rex
took a hard charge.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman wasn't hurt, but he could have been. As Ainge relived
the incident, he smiled and shook his head and covered his eyes
with a hand. ``Oh, man. . .''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting,'' Proski said, between massages
and ice packs. ``We've already had a lot of twinges and strains.
When you play three games in three nights, or five games in seven,
it's going to take a toll on veteran players.''
</P>
<P>
   Proski knows about the cumulative effect of life in the NBA. The
Suns' one and only head trainer would have been on the injured
himself had this season not been delayed by a labor fight.
</P>
<P>
   In May Proski underwent 12 { hours of surgery. Doctors opened
him up, front and back. Asked what they did, the trainer picked up
a clear plastic bag from his office desk. The sampling of metal
bolts, screws and plates looked like an assembly kit that comes
with a book case or a desk.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeons used the hardware to repair Proski's spine. He spent 10
days in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For 32 years Proski has used his healing hands to help injured
athletes overcome a Heinz variety of ailments. In recent months he
traveled the long steep road of recovery himself.
</P>
<P>
   Proski was placed in a body cast. Getting out of bed was an
accomplishment; taking his first step a triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer smiles at the memory of the day his family went to
Wisconsin and left him at home alone. Unable to bend over, Joe
waited three hours before a friend came by and slipped on his socks
and tied his shoes.
</P>
<P>
   During his convalescence, Proski inched his way from his house
to the front gate, using a walker. While players and owners argued
for months over how to divide $2 billion in revenue, he graduated
to a cane.
</P>
<P>
   Proski is still moving a little slowly. But the man who could
become the team's MVP in this strange fragile year is back at work,
happy to be among his aspirin bottles and elastic bandages and
analgesic balms, consulting with doctors and at the beck and call
of players on the mend. &QL;

CITY URGED TO REVOKE PERMIT FOR TRUMP TOWER NEAR U.N.

 By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In what is fast becoming a cause celebre both for
Manhattan community groups and for their wealthy patrons, a group
of East Side residents asked the city on Thursday to revoke Donald
J. Trump's permit to build the tallest residential tower in the
world across the street from the United Nations and to halt
demolition on the site.
</P>
<P>
   The group, the Beekman Hill Association, says the city illegally
granted Trump a permit to build the 861-foot bronze-and-glass
tower. The group contends that the tower is out of scale with the
neighborhood and would soar 300 feet above the United Nations
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the association include the former Citibank
chairman Walter B. Wriston, the former television news anchor
Walter Cronkite, the film director James Ivory and the oil
billionaire David Koch.
</P>
<P>
   The association has raised more than $150,000 and hired
publicists and lawyers for what it believes could be a protracted
court battle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel this 90-story building is not only out of character
with the neighborhood but it is also illegal,'' said Seymour Flug,
the former chairman of the Diners Club who is chairman of the
association. ``We're not antidevelopment or anti-Trump. We want to
encourage developers to come in here. All that we ask is that they
build a legal building.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers are now demolishing the 18-story United Engineering
Center, which is on Trump's construction site. Trump and his Korean
partner, the Daewoo Corp., bought the development site on First
Avenue about two years ago for $52 million. They then quietly
bought up the unused development rights from the neighboring
properties on the block for another $30 million.
</P>
<P>
   Flug said the City Buildings Department wrongfully allowed Trump
to transfer development or air rights from other properties on the
block. But even if the transfer was legal, Flug and his lawyers
said the zoning regulations governing the development rights should
have resulted in a shorter, more squat building than the slim tower
that Trump is calling Trump World Tower.
</P>
<P>
   The Buildings Department, which received the association's
request Thursday, declined comment.
</P>
<P>
   With his permits in place and $360 million of financing in hand,
Trump said that he was confident that the project would proceed. He
said he had obtained the permits from the Buildings Department and
the City Planning Department after city officials reviewed these
issues ``ad nauseam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are going to lose their views and these are the
people who are fighting the job,'' Trump said. ``Welcome to New
York.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the Trump Organization say they already have sold
80 multimillion-dollar apartments in the tower, even though it will
not open for another two years. The building is expected to have
376 apartments.

ASU PITCHERS WORK MAGIC  
 DESPITE INEXPERIENCE, SQUAD IS UNBEATEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Coach Pat Murphy said ``we're doing it with mirrors,'' he
wasn't kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State's top six pitchers have 1{ scholarships among
them. It is not exactly a formula for success, but the baseball
team has thrived. The Sun Devils take an 11-0 record into a crucial
three-game series at Florida State that begins today.
</P>
<P>
   With ASU's early schedule a bit on the light side, this will be
the most telling series to date.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really will get a much better sense of where we're at,''
Murphy said. ``Of all the controversy we've faced this season, it
has given us a little instability. But our players have handled
that part very well. They're acting very mature for an
inexperienced ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   That controversy includes adjusting to a new Pac-10 schedule and
playing with wood bats. If any part of the team has set itself
apart during that time, it has been the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The group's ERA is 1.34. The pitchers have struck out 113 and
walked just 18. It's an impressive statistic considering the Sun
Devils lost four of their top five pitchers from last season, are
without two of their top recruits _ Paul French and Ian Perio _
because of elbow injuries, and unexpectedly had three other
recruits sign professional contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think of the way these pitchers are sticking to the plan is
kind of neat,'' Murphy said. ``It says a lot about (new pitching
coach John) Pawlowski and the job he's done with the staff. We
never emphasize one section of the program, but if there's a
surprise, it's the way Pawlowski has rooted himself in such a way
that these guys have taken to his teachings.''
</P>
<P>
   In one way, the use of wood bats, which will continue until the
Pac-10 says otherwise, has helped the staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's allowing them to gain confidence while throwing
strikes,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those players is Will Waldrip, a transfer from Brigham
Young who attended Flagstaff High School. Two of his three
victories are complete-game shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Another is Jon Switzer, who will start Sunday. Murphy found the
freshman left-hander in his baseball camp.
</P>
<P>
   Although the offense has produced just one home run, Murphy
believes this team has a lot more power than last year's. Wood bats
are the culprit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd have 25 home runs,'' he said. ``Third baseman Andrew
Beinbrink would have eight to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles (3-0), who are ranked No. 4 by ``Baseball
America,'' have agreed to use wood bats for this series. They
opened the season with a three-game sweep of North
Carolina-Ashville last weekend and finished seventh at the College
World Series last year.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th-ranked Sun Devils would receive an emotional boost by
beating Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a little bit of everything,'' Murphy said. ``We've got
a little speed, a little defense, a little bit of hitting, a little
bit of pitching and a lot of good attitude. I think that's the
key.'' &QL;

VETERAN COACH LANDA JOINS MERCURY STAFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Howie Landa, who coached Hall of Famer Ann Meyers in
one of the first U.S. professional women's basketball leagues, is
the newest addition to the WNBA runner-up Mercury's coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   The 67-year-old Landa will bring more than 40 years of men's and
women's pro and college coaching experience. He joins third-year
Coach-General Manager Cheryl Miller and Carrie Graf, the Australian
Women's National Team assistant coach who returns for a second year
with the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real excited because Howie's knowledge is not surpassed by
anyone in the league,'' Mercury Vice President Seth Sulka said.
``He knows basketball and how to teach and coach. He's a great
addition.''
</P>
<P>
   Landa replaces Kathy Anderson, who replaced the lone 1997
assistant, Steve Smith, now an assistant with the Detroit Shock.
</P>
<P>
   Landa was coach of the New Jersey Gems, which featured Meyers,
of the Women's Basketball League in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   His other coaching stops included Allentown Jets (1972-73) of
the Eastern Pro League, Brill (1974-75) of the Italian League,
Mercer County (N.J.) Community College and the University of
Nevada-Las Vegas. He was the UNLV men's assistant in 1988-89 and
1994-95, a stint that included seven games as interim head coach in
place of Tim Grgurich, and women's assistant from 1989-93.
</P>
<P>
   Now a noted basketball clinician, Landa first earned national
recognition in 1953 as leading scorer for the Lebanon Valley Seven
Dwarfs. Then with an enrollment of 425 and no player taller than
6-foot-1, Lebanon Valley is the smallest school ever to play in the
NCAA Tournament, beating Fordham before losing to eventual Final
Four qualifier Louisiana State.
</P>
<P>
   Next up for the Mercury is announcement of its 32-game schedule,
expected next week. &QL;

GENERAL MANAGERS PUT SHOOTOUT TALKS ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - NHL general managers wrapped up four days of league
meetings Thursday in Palm Springs, Calif., but one of the subjects
up for discussion _ the future of overtime games _ was dropped from
the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Because 75 to 80 percent of overtime games remain tied after a
five-minute extra period, there has been talk that the league might
consider adopting the shootout policy, which has become so popular
in International Hockey League games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to see if what we have makes sense,'' NHL
Commissioner
 &UR; Gary Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to Thursday's game against the San Jose Sharks, five of
the Coyotes' past eight games had ended in ties. Their 10 ties
overall already are more than the club had in seven of its first 19
NHL seasons and they are well within reach of breaking the
franchise record for most ties in a season _ 15, set in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith, however, isn't in favor of adding
a shootout to decide games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you should play 60 or 65 minutes of hockey and
then have your game decided in a skills competition between two
players,'' he said. ``I don't think a tie is an unacceptable
outcome to a hockey game. It is in a playoff game, but we play
overtime until we settle it.'' &QL; 
Tkachuk sidelined &QL; 
Coyotes captain  &UR; Keith Tkachuk, who recently missed eight games
because of a fractured rib, did not play Thursday because of what
the team described as a lower back strain suffered during Tuesday's
2-2 tie with Calgary.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 13th game Tkachuk has missed this season because of
various injuries but there is a possibility he could be back in the
lineup for Saturday's game against Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise for left wing  &UR; Mike Sullivan, who's missed 11 games
because of a cracked rib, although he's more probable for Monday's
rematch against the Sharks. &QL; 
Traveling circus &QL; 
Thursday's game marked the first of a 10-game, three-week trip for
the visiting San Jose Sharks, who now head to Los Angeles before
returning back to Phoenix on Monday. After that, it's on to
Chicago, St. Louis, Tampa Bay, Miami, Detroit, Buffalo and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second-longest trip in NHL history, surpassed only by
the Calgary Flames' 11-game trip in 1988, caused because of the
Winter Olympics that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who made our schedule, but obviously, we did
something wrong,'' said recently-retired  &UR; Bernie Nicholls, now an
assistant coach for the Sharks. ``I mean, how many other teams
started in Japan and then get a 10-game trip?''
</P>
<P>
   How does one pack for such a trip?
</P>
<P>
   ``The dress code on this team is not that strict,'' center  &UR; Bob
 &UR; Rouse said. ``I know some guys who can stretch one turtleneck out
for a week.'' &QL; 
Slap shots &QL; 
The Coyotes have signed free-agent defenseman  &UR; Sean McCann of the
IHL Orlando Solar Bears to a one-year deal and assigned him to
Springfield of the American Hockey League. McCann, 27, who is
6-foot, 195 pounds, had four goals and 13 points in 42 games for
Orlando this season. McCann was the Florida Panthers' first overall
choice in the 1994 NHL Supplemental Draft.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman  &UR; Keith Carney has assumed the role of official
spokesperson for the Thunder on Ice program, which introduces ice
hockey into Arizona's high schools as a club program. During the
second week in April, more than 100 students will participate in
the state's first ever prep club championship. League play is
expected to start in the fall. For information, call (602)
234-6912.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago today, Tkachuk signed his first pro contract. &QL;

HEBERT GETS CONTRACT EXTENSION WITH DUCKS
</HEADLINE>

By STEVE HUNT  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Mighty Ducks goalie Guy Hebert could have
tested the free-agent market after this season and probably would
have received lucrative contract offers from several National
Hockey League teams.
</P>
<P>
   But Hebert has said repeatedly that he wants to stay in Anaheim.
Thursday he proved it, spurning the chance to become an
unrestricted free agent and signing a three-year contract
extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great honor to have been a part of this
organization for the last six years,'' said Hebert, 32, the first
player the Ducks selected in the 1993 expansion draft. ``Hopefully,
I'll be able to end my career in Anaheim and maybe have a Stanley
Cup to go with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question I could have tested the market. But I wanted to
stay in Anaheim. Everything that's transpired will benefit me as a
hockey player. You want to get what you're worth, but you also want
to be happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Ducks president and general manager Pierre Gauthier said it only
took a couple of weeks of negotiating to reach agreement on the
contract terms, which he declined to announce per club policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guy was due to become an unrestricted free agent and we feel
he would have been the best goaltender available,'' Gauthier said.
``We believe it is a great signing for us today.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a very key player and he's an original Mighty Duck.
To be able to keep him in our organization for the foreseeable
future is a great step for us. We felt it was very important to do
it right away. We didn't want a distraction (during the team's
playoff drive).''
</P>
<P>
   Hebert, who began his career with the St. Louis Blues, is
16-18-7 in in 41 games this season. He has a 2.31 goals-against
average and a career-high five shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   He has a career record of 115-132-33 with a 2.91 career
goals-against average.

PHONY WAR HEROES DEBUNKED BY REAL THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Editors: Dennis McCarthy is a columnist for the Los Angeles Daily
News.) 
BY DENNIS MCCARTHY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The last Mitchell Paige heard, the guy was up in
the Seattle area somewhere, running up thousands of dollars in
hospital bills he couldn't pay.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have any money, but he told people he had something of
value in his knapsack -- something he was very proud of: the Medal
of Honor he was awarded for heroism in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   His story touched the hospital staff and others who heard it. A
war hero fallen on hard times. Sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you knew it, his hospital bills were paid for him, and
the guy took it on the lam again,'' Paige said. ``But I'll find
him. You can be sure of that. I'll find him.''
</P>
<P>
   Find him because the guy's a phony -- just like 500 other Medal
of Honor phonies whom the 80-year-old Paige, a real Medal of Honor
recipient from World War II, has tracked down in the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Men who paid $500 to $1,000 for their medal on the black market
and became instant heroes on their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Men who had streets and schools named after them, cut the tape
on new highways and were grand marshals in their hometown Fourth of
July parade.
</P>
<P>
   Men from all walks of life -- local businessmen to judges,
politicians, and even an astronaut in training.
</P>
<P>
   Paige, a retired Marine Corps colonel, found them all -- by
himself for the first 35 years, more recently with the help of the
FBI.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Congress passed a federal crime bill stiffening the
penalties from a $250 slap on the wrist to a year in jail and
$100,000 fine for anyone caught fraudulently making, buying selling
or wearing the Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   He exposes the phonies in the name of the real heroes, Paige
says -- the GIs who fought and often gave their lives for their
country, but seldom, if ever, got any recognition for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do this for the guys who stayed behind and gave up their
lives holding off the enemy while their squad or platoon escaped,
the guys nobody ever recognized because nobody knows their names,''
Paige said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the real heroes. To have these phonies take the glory
is a disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 160 living Medal of Honor recipients, all of them
listed in files Paige keeps with their pictures and identification
information.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not in that file, you aren't the real thing, Paige
said.
</P>
<P>
   Phony, like the grand marshal of a Fourth of July parade in
Twentynine Palms whom Paige exposed a few years back, or the judge
in Illinois who upgraded his Purple Heart to a Medal of Honor, or
the New Jersey mayor who resigned in disgrace after Paige debunked
him.
</P>
<P>
   The list is long and ugly -- phonies who got their hands on
unauthorized copies of the Medal of Honor that were sold on the
black market by HLI Lordship Inc., the Long Island company that had
the government contract for producing the real medals.
</P>
<P>
   The company was fined $80,000 in 1997 for selling 300
unauthorized copies of the medal and lost its government contract.
</P>
<P>
   But it's too late to get those 300 medals -- and probably more,
Paige thinks -- out of circulation. They're already hanging around
the necks of phonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``After they're caught and I talk to them, most of these guys
say they just got in over their heads,'' Paige said. ``They'll
start by telling some lies to people in their communities about
their war record, how they were heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, they get invited to speak at some function, and they
embellish it even more. Pretty soon, they've built themselves up to
be a Medal of Honor winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before you know it, they're in the local newspaper cutting
ribbons or having streets named after them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Someone in those communities, usually a veteran, will smell a
rat and send the story to Paige. He'll check his files, and if the
local hero isn't there, he'll catch the next plane to the guy's
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   As he says, he does it for all the men who never got recognized
for their heroism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got my medal, I dedicated it to everyone of the 33 men
in my platoon who were killed or severely wounded holding off
hundreds of enemy charging the hill to overrun our position,'' said
Paige, who received his medal for service at Guadalcanal in October
1942. ``They were the real heroes.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige said this with his customary humbleness. He doesn't
mention that when Hasbro Inc., maker of the famous GI Joe dolls,
went looking last year for one Marine to honor as the new GI Joe
action figure, representing all Medal of Honor recipients, it was
the name Mitchell Paige that went on the box.
</P>
<P>
   The real thing. Not one of those phonies.

REAGAN ALUMS FONDLY RECALL ERA AT SIMI VALLEY SUMMIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. -- Ronald Reagan was once asked whether it
was true he earned only a C average while at Eureka College in the
1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' replied Reagan, then president of the United States.
``Even now I wonder what I might have accomplished if I'd studied
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The fond anecdote drew laughter and applause Thursday as more
than 300 Reagan administration alumni gathered at the Ronald Reagan
Presidential Library &AMP; Museum to rehash the Reagan era and wish the
ailing former president a happy birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan, who will turn 88 on Saturday, suffers from Alzheimer's
disease and could not attend the conference or his nighttime
birthday gala. But former first lady Nancy Reagan attended, as did
former U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese, United Nations Ambassador
Jeane Kirkpatrick and conservative pundit William F. Buckley Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The mood of the day was cheerful, but many remembrances seemed
more like a wake for the former president, who was often referred
to in the past tense.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Reagan said her father's decline has been mercifully
gentle.
</P>
<P>
   ``The disease is horrible, but he's doing well,'' she said. ``He
makes it easy for us. He's very lovable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have enjoyed the stories and humor,'' said former
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum Baker. ``It was very much a part of his
governing strength. He could ease tension with a story. People who
disagreed with him would often end up doing what he wanted without
even realizing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reagan made only a brief appearance at the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to see his wife sitting there hearing all this and
him not being here,'' said Lawrence Goldberg, a San Francisco
resident who worked on both Reagan's and Richard Nixon's
presidential bids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have great affection for President Reagan,'' he added. ``He
restored confidence and honor to the presidency -- something we are
sorely lacking today. His foreign and economic policies are still
with us to this day. Reagan just had it.''
</P>
<P>
   As historians debated Reagan's historical legacy, former
administration staffers greeted each other with hugs, handshakes
and shared tales of their lives since Reagan left office a decade
ago. They reveled in the powerful legacy of the administration and
the continued national economic prosperity that began with
Reaganomics in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Jarratt, who served in Reagan's press office for six years,
credits Reagan with inspiring him to open nine Burger King
franchises in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He set free the American entrepreneurial spirit,'' Jarratt
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering brought a touch of Washington to Simi Valley, if
only for a day and a half. During a discussion of Reagan's economic
policies, one woman slipped into the hallway to check on the Senate
impeachment trial of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God!'' she said with a frown. ``Twenty-five Republicans
defected and voted against having Monica Lewinsky as a witness.''
</P>
<P>
   Dinesh D'Souza, author of ``Ronald Reagan: How an Ordinary Man
Became an Extraordinary Leader,'' drew appreciative chuckles when
he compared former President Nixon's long, thoughtful diary entries
to Reagan's brief notes on, for example, his historic first meeting
with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wrote, `Can't give away the store on SDI!!' That's it,''
D'Souza said. ``Historians were maddened.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald Reagan could sit down with you and tell jokes just like
one of the guys,'' said Don Totten, a former Reagan campaign
official from Illinois. ``You were not intimidated by the office
when you sat down with Reagan. You were definitely intimidated when
you sat down with Nixon.''
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Reagan marveled at how his down-home simplicity
belied a much deeper and secret personality that continues to
confound historians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's humor was not written for him by staffers. He
had an innate, quick sense of humor,'' said David Swoap, who served
as an official under Reagan in Washington and in his Cabinet when
he was California governor. ``But he also had this incredible
depth. He had the ability to zero in on the heart of a complicated
issue and sum it all up in about three sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought seriously about these issues,'' Kirkpatrick said.
``There are a lot of people who didn't think President Reagan
thought seriously; so much the worse for them.''

(DW) 
 By JOSEPH BERGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A mere two months after the closing of the Concord Resort Hotel
touched off a new wave of obituaries about the Catskills, fire-sale
real estate prices and renewed hopes for casino gambling have
prompted a surge of investment in the old Borscht Belt.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,100-room Concord, built in the late 1930s by a hair-tonic
magnate, was snapped up in mid-January for $10.25 million by an
investment group that plans to spend $40 million to convert it into
a Sheraton franchise and market it to a clientele more diverse than
its traditional base of Jewish vacationers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Grossinger's, the Catskills' fabled grand dowager
and the career springboard for entertainers like Milton Berle and
Eddie Fisher, was sold at a federal bankruptcy auction in Manhattan
for $6 million to a partnership that includes Louis R. Cappelli,
one of the leading builders in Westchester County, outside New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   Cappelli is a major contributor to Republican politicians, most
prominently Gov. George E. Pataki, who controls the fate of
gambling in the region. Cappelli's lawyer, Joseph S. Rosenthal,
said that the partnership plans to convert Grossinger's into a
``five-star golf resort and spa'' whose success would not be
dependent on gambling but would greatly profit from it.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the region's more upbeat mood stems from the improved
prospects for casino gambling. In December, regional officials of
the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs recommended approval of a $500
million casino on land at the Monticello Raceway that would be
given in trust to the St. Regis Mohawk Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plan still awaits the endorsement of the U.S.
Secretary of the Interior and Pataki, this first federal
recommendation has attracted the interest of investors around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a great stock that has tremendous value but isn't
selling for a lot of money,'' said Alan Gerry, a cable-television
entrepreneur who owns the muddy farm in Bethel where the 1969
Woodstock concert was held. ``Then one guy recognizes its value and
other people start putting in money. That's what's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk of a rebirth before, but those hopes turned
out to be wishful thinking, and the Catskills has more than enough
forlorn main streets and dilapidated bungalows to give the skeptics
reason to gloat.
</P>
<P>
   The most concrete evidence of a revival, the old Stevensville
Resort Hotel, which closed nine years ago and had been destined for
demolition, will reopen in May as the 355-room Swan Lake Golf and
Tennis Resort Hotel. Its lobby has been fitted with crystal
chandeliers, suits of armor and a 12-foot-long jade boat that make
it as opulent as anything Catskills legend ever served up.
</P>
<P>
   It also has a nonkosher Korean and Japanese kitchen intended for
a more diverse clientele.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the land once occupied by the sprawling Laurels
Country Club was bought last month for $1.05 million by developers
who plan to build a Las Vegas-style hotel and entertainment
complex.
</P>
<P>
   In Bethel, Gerry is hoping to turn the old Woodstock site into a
theme park devoted to popular music. Last year the site played host
to a concert that drew 70,000 people over three days. This summer
Gerry is hoping to produce four weekends of music.
</P>
<P>
   Although developers hope that the St. Regis Mohawk casino will
be approved, they insist that their plans are not dependent on
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happens, it would be frosting on the cake,'' said James
Hoppensteadt, a former Sheraton executive and now vice president of
Concord Associates, which purchased the Concord in a federal
bankruptcy auction.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the recent spate of deals, Sullivan County, the
heart of the Catskills with 70,000 year-round residents, had been
making itself more alluring, promoting the demolition of moribund
properties and advertising itself as a playground for fly-fishing,
eagle sightings, golf and skiing. Main Street storefronts have been
restored and 15-year tax abatements provided to developers like
those at the Stevensville.
</P>
<P>
   Although it may seem paradoxical, officials in Sullivan County
believe that the new investment in the Catskills is largely due to
the fact that hoteliers finally have stopped waiting for the
gambling miracle that would ride to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   An important catalyst for the recent flurry of activity is that
prices for rundown hotels have hit rock bottom _ the Concord's
value fell by half in a matter of months _ low enough so that
investors can afford to put up the capital needed for extensive
renovations.
</P>
<P>
   The old Catskills provided a style of vacation that fell out of
favor by the late 1960s. The groups from which guests were
traditionally drawn grew more educated, cosmopolitan and
cholesterol-conscious and more interested in vacations in Tuscany
or the Hamptons. They tired of three banquets a day and found the
hotel tummlers _ frantic round-the-clock jesters whose ranks once
included Danny Kaye and Jerry Lewis _ shopworn and shrill.
</P>
<P>
   But the upstart developers believe the Catskills will have a
fresh appeal to working couples who may find it difficult to
coordinate three-week vacations to Europe and would like shorter
getaways that are only an hour and 45 minutes' drive from
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Said Zev Scharf, a partner in the new ownership of the Laurels,
``Whatever worked against the Catskills before can work for it
now.''

YOUNG FISHER IS OLD RELIABLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The yellow team was in the huddle and the
20-year-old swingman was reminding his point guard and everybody
else within earshot that he's the go-to guy. It was late in a
recent Lakers scrimmage but not too early to head off trouble at
the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen-year veteran Derek Harper listened to Kobe Bryant go
off, then discreetly pulled Derek Fisher aside, as Gus Williams had
once done with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen, Fish,'' the one Derek told the other. ``You've gotta
remember, you're the guy running the show with the game on the
line. You have to be in control of the team, not let the team
control you.''
</P>
<P>
   What Harper didn't have to say is, it's not easy being point
guard to the stars.
</P>
<P>
   People look at you the way Michelle Pfeiffer's male admirers
eyeball David Kelley. You can count on being widely (and warily)
regarded as a lucky so-and-so to be linked with All-Stars Shaquille
O'Neal and Eddie Jones and Bryant and steering an offense that
everybody assumes is running on cruise control, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I have it easy because of the (caliber of)
players around me,'' Fisher said. ``I know a lot of people think
I'm the weak link in the chain. But in a sense, I'm the link
holding the chain together.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at Shaq, I have to get him touches inside. A guy as
young and talented as Kobe, he's a shooter, he's paid to score; I
have to get him his touches. A guy like Eddie, he's not going to
say much, but I can sense it, I can feel it, I can see it in his
body language that he's frustrated if he's not getting his
touches.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher frets over his teammates' psyches, he really does. He's
always looking out for them, so it bothers him when they don't look
out for anybody but No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball is not fun if everyone's not willing to make the
extra pass, set a screen or play good defense,'' Fisher said. ``The
main thing that will be said this season when everybody starts to
freelance is that there's no leader on this team that can take
control. It'll be the point guard's fault. Or the head coach's.
</P>
<P>
   ``But until we get to the point where everybody's interested in
what WE'RE getting out of this and not what THEY'RE getting out of
it, there's no sense even kidding ourselves into thinking we can be
the best team in basketball. Until then, we'll continue to peak and
then fall off.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Lakers have to realize it's not all about style before
they can become a team of substance. Who better to show them the
way than their most unassuming player?
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, 24, is that and so much more. He's a tireless worker and
an unselfish teammate. He's the rare player who'd rather take a
charge than a shot and he cares more about the bottom line than his
own line in the box score.
</P>
<P>
   He's as dependable as the old family sedan and about as flashy.
Maybe that's why he's so easy to overlook.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher came out of the same draft as Bryant, separated by 11
picks and a world of hype. Bryant was the teen phenom from
Philadelphia; Fisher the obscure player out of Arkansas-Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like, perception-wise, I was starting two feet under
before I even started,'' Fisher said. ``I feel like I'm having to
dig myself out.''
</P>
<P>
   There ought to be more ways to earn notice than to drive the
fanciest car, run with the swankiest crowd, endorse the most
products or put up the best numbers. Yet, despite two solid pro
seasons spent mostly as a backup to Nick Van Exel, Fisher feels
more invisible than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Someday soon somebody's bound to notice that he's the first one
at practice and one of the last to leave. Or that he's the first
one to help a teammate get his shot and the last looking to pad his
own stats. In the meantime, if it's unconditional acceptance Fisher
is after, he probably should go out and get a dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes it's frustrating,'' Fisher said. ``I feel the way I
carry myself and what I stand for, I deserve a certain level of
respect. I don't expect to be one of the stars on this team. But
there are some times I wonder if the guys have the same respect for
me as they do Eddie, Kobe and Shaq.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if he's not the product of a big-time college program?
When Fisher wrote a letter that he distributed to each of his
teammates imploring them to come together and play as one during
the Western Conference Finals against Utah, they could at least
have applauded his passion, not crumpled the paper up and left it
for the janitor.
</P>
<P>
   So what if he doesn't hang with the Hollywood heavies? When
Fisher contacted his teammates at the start of the lockout and
again at its end to try to organize group workouts, the least they
could have done was gotten back in touch with him.
</P>
<P>
   That's OK. Fisher is nothing if not persistent.
</P>
<P>
   When training camp got under way in Santa Barbara, Fisher was
troubled by what he saw. Too many guys were freelancing. There
wasn't a whole lot of teamwork going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel everybody had left their personal agendas
behind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So he spoke up. In a voice that sometimes cracked with emotion
Fisher said, ``If everybody's not interested in playing as a team,
let's get it out in the open now. Because if we're just going to do
our own thing, I'll go out and pad my own stats so I can get (a
new) contract next year.''
</P>
<P>
   That got everybody's attention. Starting tonight, we'll find out
if Fisher has been able to keep it.

 MCDYESS' DEFECTION REWRITES BLUEPRINT

<P>
   PHOENIX - Plan, plan, plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have been through more of them than the old Soviet
Union, a kingdom that was reduced to Clipperdom.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is forecasting such a fate for the Suns. The empire
without a crown isn't on a fast-break pace to become the NBA's
version of Kazakstan, an exiled franchise forever without a chance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Suns aren't exactly headed for the inner circle, either.
Something called the lockout got in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``A funny thing happened on the way to the Forum,'' Suns
President Jerry Colangelo said a couple of weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't laughing.
</P>
<P>
   A philosophical Colangelo made the comment the day after Antonio
McDyess' jump to Denver landed in Phoenix like a grenade.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns were left to pick up the pieces. They did so in a swift
fashion that might prove brilliant. Forward Tom Gugliotta signed.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the loss of McDyess summed up the Suns' plight.
They had spent all of the 1997-98 season planning a major shopping
spree. Financial flexibility was a theme for the season. They had
about $15 million to spend.
</P>
<P>
   But then the owners locked out the players. For the Suns, there
was double meaning in the term lockout. They were the optimistic
shopper with a fistful of cash, who suddenly couldn't get into the
store.
</P>
<P>
   A summer plan for negotiations and news conferences turned into
a long, anxious stretch full of wondering and hoping. They
succeeded with Plan B, the alternate hustle to sign Gugliotta after
the loss of McDyess.
</P>
<P>
   But their real hope, Plan A, was to sign both. Widespread and
well-founded speculation about Scottie Pippen changed when he
underwent back surgery after last season's final championship run
with the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Pippen's age, 33, and history of injury played heavily in the
Suns' decision not to make a run at him. Instead, he went to
Houston as the Suns waited in vain on McDyess before making a
concerted move on Gugliotta, who had supplanted Pippen as their
prime target.
</P>
<P>
   With the acquisition of 7-foot-2 center Luc Longley in a deal
with Chicago, the Suns' hope was for a front line of McDyess and
Gugliotta to flank the big man. It was intriguing and potentially
imposing. But it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're refocusing on a different team than I had expected,''
Suns Coach Danny Ainge said. ``There was a time a couple of months
ago when we expected a different level of talent. Then there was
time a couple of weeks ago when I wasn't expecting anything at all.
But now, I'm optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, McDyess might have slipped from the Suns' grasp,
anyway. As it turns out, he was at least thinking about a return to
Denver even before the owners locked their doors to the players.
</P>
<P>
   There are questions about the Suns' timing and decision not to
lock McDyess into a long-term deal before the work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   But Colangelo said he was confident at midseason last year that
a new deal could be reached with McDyess' agent at the time, Arn
Tellem. McDyess then fired Tellem and hired Tony Dutt last summer,
a lockout period during which NBA management was prohibited from
talking to free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a hunch then that he wasn't coming back,'' Colangelo
said.
</P>
<P>
   But by then, the process was under way. General Bryan Colangelo
went to work under the revised salary cup rules and put together a
Longely deal that was critical. It allowed the Suns more money to
offer Gugliotta in the first season of his six-year, $58.5 million
contract. Instead of offering less than $6 million in the first
year, the Suns were able to offer Gugliotta $7.8 million because of
salary cap space cleared in the Longley acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   They also were able to keep $3.5 million for a one-year contract
for Clifford Robinson and then a six-year, $22.1 million deal for
Rex Chapman.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman was a given in any Suns plan. He had announced that he
would return for the league average salary.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson became a key part of the plan as signs of McDyess'
departure began to mount. All the while, the Suns were adding other
pieces along the way. Backup center Joe Kleine signed. George
McCloud re-enlisted for a second season. Rookies Pat Garrity, Toby
Bailey and Gerald Brown got standard contracts. Chris Morris was
added two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing things on the run,'' Ainge said.
</P>
<P>
   From a team with a long history of being at its best while on
the run, it's a plan in process. &QL;

IT'S KIDD'S TEAM NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Ever since the Suns duped the Dallas Mavericks into
trading Jason Kidd the day after Christmas in 1996, there never has
been a doubt about who would be the club's point guard of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   However, for a season and a half, there was robust debate about
the point guard of the present.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the point guard of the Suns' past, Kevin Johnson, is
shopping the free-agent market, and the 1999 Suns are Kidd's alone
to run.
</P>
<P>
   From the first days of the club's training camp, when he was
going at a break-neck pace and even getting into the faces of
teammates, Kidd has demonstrated that he's ready to take on the
chore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tempers flared a couple of times, and I was glad they did,''
Kidd said. ``I wanted to see where everybody was at. I wanted to
know if everybody was on the same page.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm going into battle, if I'm going on a mission, I want to
know who's going to follow me in. I wanted to set that tone from
Day 1.''
</P>
<P>
   It was something Kidd had been reluctant to do in the past. He
followed KJ as a collegiate star at California, admired him as a
pro. So Kidd looked upon the Suns as KJ's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did defer to him,'' Kidd said. ``That's an awkward situation
to be traded to a team that has a Hall of Fame point guard on the
team for a long time. I didn't want to say very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to lead by just playing hard, and that's still the way
I love to lead. I still don't like to say too much, but if there's
a time to say something this year, I will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be accountable, and the best way is to lead by
example. I've been physical in practice. The guys will tell you
I've been playing like it's the playoffs. We have to be a tougher
team this season, and I put on a little weight, got a little
stronger in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want us to be more physical, and that means I have to play
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's teammates have noticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason just seems to be on a mission,'' guard Rex Chapman said.
``He goes hard every day and hasn't taken a practice off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand why Jason was reluctant (to assert himself).
This is, what, his fifth year in the league? It wasn't just a thing
with Kevin being with the Suns for so long, it was following him at
Cal and all of that. Kevin was a guy who had earned his stripes,
and it was tough for Jason.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough for Kevin, too. And it wasn't easy for (Coach)
Danny Ainge. He played with Kevin and has a lot of respect for him
as a player and a person. That's not an easy situation to be in. I
think they all handled it pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ainge said Kidd has to have a greater comfort level now. In
Kidd's first season in Phoenix, he came off the bench at one point
and often played without the ball because KJ was at his best with
it. KJ also sacrificed, playing shooting guard alongside Kidd and
starting only 12 of the 50 games he played last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sure seems (more comfortable) in practices and (exhibition)
games so far,'' Ainge said. ``He does seem like he has a comfort
level.''
</P>
<P>
   Ainge said he saw occasions when Kidd was reluctant to assert
leadership, but not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just Jason, I saw it in KJ, too,'' he said. ``I
think they both like each other and respect each other. It just
wasn't perfect for either one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did see a little bit of that (reluctance). They tried, and I
give them credit, and we had pretty good success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jason is very excited that this is his team now. He's
come in with that attitude and seems like he's been on a high from
the day he arrived at camp, from the first day. I think everything
about Jason is better than it's been in his basketball life.
</P>
<P>
   ``His practice habits are better. His intensity in practice is
better. There are things he can still improve on, but I think he's
going to be a very good leader for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Kidd's strengths are still his open-court game, defense and
relentlessness. Since that trade, the Suns have attempted to retool
to fit those strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the fastest point guard in the league,'' Ainge said.
``We want to play up-tempo, and at the same time, we recognize that
we have to be able to execute in the half court. And I think Jason
has really improved his half-court game.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been shooting the ball with confidence, and that's been
the only thing that's ever been questioned with Jason,'' Chapman
said. ``He sure has shot it well in the preseason.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman figures that the rest of the NBA is about to find out
about Kidd's mission.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that bothers me most about people
overlooking our team right now is that we've got the best point
guard in the NBA,'' he said. ``That's got to say something.'' &QL;

SUNS DON'T MIND BEING UNKNOWN COMMODITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Suns find themselves in an unusual spot. Almost
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   They've always been a team with a hook, an identity. The team
that lost the coin flip for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar in the late 1960s
became basketball's prettiest team in the 1980s. They swaggered
through the early 1990s with the raucous and unrepentant Charles
Barkley pushing them to the edge.
</P>
<P>
   But as they escape the NBA lockout and approach the millennium,
the Suns are caught in anonymity. Call them Team Mystery. Who are
these guys?
</P>
<P>
   With Jason Kidd, Tom Gugliotta and Danny Manning, the Suns have
their share of proven, well-known players. But the eventual mix has
been hard to evaluate for even the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a much better idea than anybody else at this
point,'' said Suns Coach Danny Ainge, whose work in progress
started amid the chaos of an abbreviated training camp and a
frenetic free-agent shuffle that started with the loss of Antonio
McDyess to Denver and continued with the acquisition of Gugliotta.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the early uncertainty, Ainge remains upbeat about
chances that the Suns will strike the right mix and challenge at
the end of a 50-game season. The only sure bet is that they won't
repeat last season's 56 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever success they have won't come easily. With Michael
Jordan's retirement and the disbanding of the Chicago dynasty, the
NBA's balance of power has shifted West.
</P>
<P>
   In all the preseason handicapping, the Suns are picked to finish
no better than fifth. In other words, they are an afterthought. Go
ahead, ask a coach _ almost any coach _ for his preseason analysis.
Inevitably, the Suns are almost forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   In conference calls with league coaches this week, Del Harris of
the Los Angeles Lakers, one of the favorites, talked about the Utah
Jazz, San Antonio Spurs, Houston, Rockets and Seattle SuperSonics
before he hastily included the Suns as a possibility toward the end
of his remarks. Harris wanted to be careful not to exclude the
Suns, but it was evident that he didn't know what to make of them.
</P>
<P>
   There's a built-in advantage amid the anonymity. The Suns have a
chance to surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's right, the West is strong,'' Kidd said of Harris'
preseason analysis. ``You've got a lot of teams that are talented,
with the Lakers, Houston, Utah, San Antonio and Seattle. Hopefully,
we can just lay in the weeds. Those teams are the most dangerous.
Those teams have all the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's talking about us, and that's the way to start a
season. You want them ``all'' to be talking about you at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of preseason buzz surrounding the Suns is rooted in two
areas: suspect depth and suspect defense.
</P>
<P>
   Of the two, the first appears to be the most critical. Fears of
season-ending injuries are unavoidable in the Suns' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Guard Rex Chapman, a dependable shooter and unyielding
competitor, might not play in tonight's opener against the Clippers
in Los Angeles because of a nagging problems with his right
hamstring. Over a compressed schedule with sometimes four games a
week, there is concern about whether Chapman can last. The worry
explains this week's acquisition of swingman Chris Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Morris has some of the same versatility as guard-forward George
McCloud, who is a possible starter in his second season on the
Phoenix roster. Morris could be a redundant addition. But in a
compressed season, Ainge might need as many parts as possible, no
matter how redundant.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, there are questions about the backups at nearly
every position. Kidd's backup, Gerald Brown, the Terry Porter
look-alike from Carl Hayden High School, showed poise and ability
in two preseason victories over Dallas. But he has yet to play in a
regular season game.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said of forward Pat Garrity, a first-round draft
pick, and Toby Bailey, a second-round pick. Against Dallas, both
played well enough to suggest that maybe the Suns have found some
keepers. Bailey looks to be agile and tough. In two exhibitions
against Dallas, Garrity averaged 15.5 points on 50 percent
shooting. But, again, neither has appeared in a regular season
game.
</P>
<P>
   The other question, defense, was highlighted against Dallas, a
league lightweight last year. The Mavericks averaged 109.5 points
in the two exhibition games. The current Mavericks are a collection
of ex-Suns who gave up 116.5 points to the current Suns. Can any of
these Suns play defense?
</P>
<P>
   In time, Ainge thinks so. The physical Kidd already is
acknowledged as one of the league's best backcourt defenders. With
the acquisition of 7-foot-2 center Luc Longley from Chicago, the
Suns can start one of the biggest front lines in their history with
6-10 Gugliotta at one forward and 6-10 Clifford Robinson at the
other.
</P>
<P>
   They also appear to be more equipped to endure the slower, more
physical playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   One thing appears unchanged. The Suns always have been a team
built to score. The good news is that the offense looks as potent
as ever, especially with a front line that includes some of the
best passers among the league's big men. With Kidd as the
playmaker, the Suns could be dangerous to play and entertaining to
watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a fun team,'' said Gugliotta, who figures to
benefit alongside Kidd, whose pass-first, shoot-second philosophy
is the flip side to Minnesota's Stephon Marbury. ``We move the ball
real well. The chemistry should be real good.''
</P>
<P>
   But until the mixture can be uncapped and tested, the Suns
remain an unknown commodity. &QL;

LOCKOUT'S LEGACY: PARITY  
 SUNS, OTHER TEAMS LIKELY TO KEEP STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Suns President Jerry Colangelo likes to tell the story
of a conversation he had with ESPN's basketball expert, David
Aldridge, after the NBA lockout was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Aldridge, Colangelo said, told him the Suns are the ``poster
child'' of the new collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
   And at that point, Aldridge had a good argument. After all, the
Suns had a plan that started more than two years earlier when they
traded Charles Barkley to the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   It was designed to give them as much salary cap room as possible
for the 1998 off-season, when almost half of the league's players
would be free agents.
</P>
<P>
   The lockout blew that plan apart.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, it may create an NBA that gives all 29 teams a
fair chance to compete for championships. It will limit the amount
of money the best players can get, but filter some of it down to
the middle class of players, particularly long-time veterans.
</P>
<P>
   It is designed to make it easier for teams to keep their own
best players, restricting free-agent movement, thereby creating
more continuity and perhaps fan loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   And it means it won't be the Suns on that poster.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the real poster child might just be the last dynasty _
the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had a plan, too, if Michael Jordan decided to retire.
It was to break up the team, take some lumps for a season and clear
as much salary cap space as possible for next summer's free-agent
class.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is in position to have as much as $20 million available
for next summer's shopping spree. Trouble is, there may not be
anybody to spend it on. Thanks to the new rules, teams are at an
advantage in signing their own players to contract extensions.
</P>
<P>
   And many of the best young players already have been scratched
off the list of free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Antoine Walker re-signed with the Boston Celtics, Shareef
Abdur-Raheem re-upped with the Vancouver Grizzlies, Zydrunas
Ilgauskas signed a new deal with the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Los
Angeles Lakers got Kobe Bryant's name on a new pact and Allen
Iverson agreed to an extension with Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   There still will be players available, perhaps Stephon Marbury
of Minnesota or New York's Marcus Camby. But the options are far
fewer for the Bulls, as they will be for any other team that
attempts to clear a lot of space and rebuild with free agents in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general attitude is that teams won't lose their best
players to free agency anymore,'' Colangelo said. ``There is more
incentive to stay, but there are going to be exceptions. Tom
Gugliotta didn't. Antonio McDyess didn't. But you see a lot of the
young players signing now with their teams, like Kobe, Shareef and
Antoine Walker.''
</P>
<P>
   The team that drafts a player, or already has him under
contract, has an advantage because a player can get a longer
guaranteed deal _ seven years instead of six _ with his own team,
and because he can get annual raises of 12.5 percent of his base
salary compared to a 10 percent increase from other teams.
</P>
<P>
   There will still be some movement, but it usually will be based
on factors other than money _ lifestyle, a team's style of play, an
organization's reputation. They are factors that have helped the
Suns attract free agents in the past and, in the long term, could
help them again.
</P>
<P>
   There's another potential side effect: With limits on how much
all players can make, there figure to be fewer battles with agents.
In fact, some players are hiring lawyers on an hourly basis to
handle their contracts rather than pay an agent a percentage of it.
</P>
<P>
   The end result of it all, however, is that teams with greater
resources won't have an advantage in signing players. And making a
quick fix through free agency is next to impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a feeling that if you try to strip your team
all the way down, it might take you a while to come back again,''
Colangelo said. ``If you have to start over again, it's going to be
very difficult. Teams that have their players in place are ahead of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why if we had not recovered by signing Gugliotta, we
would have been behind the 8-ball to some degree. The way it played
out, we wouldn't have had any cap space if we tried to put it off
for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; While the Suns have made some big scores in the free-agent era
_ starting with Tom Chambers and moving on to the likes of Danny
Manning, A.C. Green and Gugliotta _ the prospect of building via
trades and drafts isn't exactly frightening to them.
</P>
<P>
   Kidd, Charles Barkley, Kevin Johnson and McDyess are among their
prominent trade acquisitions. And while their draft-day success has
been intermittent, partly because they've had few early selections,
they have made some late choices of uncommon value: namely Jeff
Hornacek (46th choice, 1986), Dan Majerle (14th, '88), Cedric
Ceballos (28th, '90), Wesley Person (23rd, '94), Michael Finley
(21st, '95) and Steve Nash (15th, '96).
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more emphasis on trades and on the draft,
which I think is healthy,'' Colangelo said.
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo said the Suns never gave
any serious thought to the plan Chicago is following, which would
have meant trying to sign a lot of players to one-year deals and go
after next summer's free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my nature to say, `Wait till next year,' '' Jerry
Colangelo said. ``And when you're 59 years old, your time is
running out.'' &QL;

USAC DRIVER STRIKES INDY GOLD  
 JUST BEING THERE A DELIGHT FOR HEWITT

<P>
   PHOENIX - Jack Hewitt is from the old school, the school of hard
knocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 25 years to get to (the Indianapolis 500),'' said
Hewitt, a short-track specialist from Troy, Ohio. ``But at least I
got there.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, at 46, got there last May, then delivered one of the
most memorable quotes in Indy 500 history.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the feach (short for feature or main event), I'm going
to Eldora (Speedway) for a sprint-car race,'' Hewitt told an ABC
pit-road announcer before the start of the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   Jokingly informed he shouldn't refer to the Indy 500 as ``the
feach,'' Hewitt just shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think to a real race-car driver, Indy is just another
feature,'' Hewitt said. ``It's everything that goes along with it
that makes it so special. Then, when you finally get to the race,
it's like a cherry on top of the biggest hot fudge sundae of your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt still is wallowing in its sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is a star from another era, an era that still
managed to put a Bettenhausen, Unser and an Andretti in the Indy
500, Hewitt never did quite make it to racing's pinnacle.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, when an 11th-hour offer came knocking at
Hewitt's door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a Hollywood script without the sex and violence,'' said
Hewitt, who is driving a U.S. Auto Club Silver Bullet and USAC
midget in this weekend's U.S. Tobacco Co. Copper World Classic at
Phoenix International Raceway. ``I mean, I went from having no
ride, to getting a phone call at the last minute to go take my
rookie test at (Indianapolis Motor Speedway).
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, within four hours, I crash and tear the car up. The crew
fixes the car and the next day I spin out and lose it. But I didn't
hit anything, so I come back and practice some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, I'm the first one out to qualify and the pit crew waves
me off. We eventually make the show and I start in the seventh row,
which is the row that's right on the last set of bricks that are on
the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wind up with a flat tire early in the race, but still finish
12th. Unbelievable and amazing. I'm still thrilled by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was Hewitt's only IRL start of the season, it wasn't
the year's only grand moment.
</P>
<P>
   In September, Hewitt won the 4-Crown Nationals at Eldora,
becoming the first driver to capture all four divisions (USAC
Silver Bullet, midget, sprints and United Midwest Promoters
modifieds) on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know how difficult that is,'' said driver Jason
Leffler, last season's USAC Silver Bullet and midget champion. ``To
me, it's truly amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Hewitt has trouble believing it really happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thought it was impossible,'' said Hewitt, the
1986-87 USAC Silver Bullet champion and holder of about 75 career
USAC wins in three divisions. ``I thought so, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Making Indy still is my best moment, but Eldora is a close
second. It's real close.''
</P>
<P>
   So close that Hewitt still gets goose bumps thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people thought I had a chance to win all four in 1993,
but after I won the first one, I got hurt in the second race,''
Hewitt said. ``Another car hit the wall and landed on top of me. It
broke my neck and right arm.''
</P>
<P>
   But not Hewitt's spirit, who remains determined to return to
Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on a mission to get back in an IRL car this year,'' said
Hewitt, who missed the IRL season opener last month, but hopes to
land a ride for the next race on March 28 at PIR. &QL;

<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY _ In the summer of 1993, as Salt Lake City was
attempting to win the 2002 Winter Games, two of its top-ranking
Olympic officials tried to find a job for the unemployed husband of
the Olympic representative from Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Joklik and James C. Beardall, both members of the board of
trustees of the Salt Lake City bid committee, separately wrote
letters to the Weyerhaeuser Co. in Tacoma, Wash., seeking a
forestry job for Bjarne Haeggman. The letters were retained by the
bid committee and made available to The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In one letter, Beardall wrote that it would be ``helpful to our
Olympic bid effort'' if the company would provide a job to
Haeggman.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik and other board members have insisted in recent weeks
that they knew nothing about Salt Lake City's aggressive campaign
to provide jobs, cash payments, tuition aid and lavish gifts to
delegates of the International Olympic Committee whose votes
determined where the Games would be played.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik and Beardall, who is president of an Ogden, Utah, lumber
company, did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment. Their
lawyers also did not return telephone calls.
</P>
<P>
   A Weyerhaeuser spokeswoman confirmed that its letters to Joklik
and Beardall were authentic, and that Weyerhaeuser records did not
show that Haeggman had ever been hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's extremely disappointing,'' said Ken Bullock, a member of
the board of trustees of the Salt Lake City organizing committee
who has been critical of its business practices. ``If you have
correspondence, clearly you are a participant in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal authorities are now investigating whether the Salt Lake
City effort violated any laws. No one has been accused of
wrongdoing. The correspondence between Weyerhaeuser and the
committee begins in the summer of 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated June 29, Joklik wrote a letter to George
Weyerhaeuser, chairman of the board of the Weyerhaeuser Co., saying
that he had met Pirjo Haeggman, an IOC member from Finland, while
on a visit to the Olympic Museum in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik described her husband, Bjarne Haeggman, as an
``outstanding forester,'' and added that Joklik ``was wondering
whether Weyerhaeuser might have any position for which to consider
him.'' The letter is signed ``Frank.'' It was written on the
personal letterhead of Joklik, who was chairman of the board of
trustees of the Salt Lake City bid committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a response bearing a Weyerhaeuser letterhead, and dated Aug.
12, 1993, a company official informed Joklik that officials had
explored employment opportunities in Russia but that it could not
find ``an appropriate match'' for Bjarne Haeggman's abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, on Aug. 26, 1993, Beardall wrote to Edward P.
Rogel, Weyerhaeuser's vice president for human resources, asking
whether a job could be found for Haeggman in western Canada.
Beardall noted that Finland had 20 percent unemployment, and that
``it would be very helpful to our Olympic bid effort if we could
help Mr. Haeggman find employment.''
</P>
<P>
   After Salt Lake won the bid, Beardall was appointed to oversee
internal auditing for the Olympic organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   A way was eventually found to help Haeggman. Beginning in May
1994, the committee began paying him $3,000 a month, with total
payments reaching $30,000 to $35,000, a bid committee official
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to an organizing committee official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity, the bid committee's files contain a
document saying that Haeggman was working for Great Basin
Engineering, a company based in Salt Lake City and Ogden, Utah.
This arrangement, the document asserted, had been approved by
Thomas K. Welch, the bid committee president.
</P>
<P>
   Jay R. Anderson, president and owner of Great Basin, said he
never employed Haeggman. Anderson said he did recall a conversation
in 1993 with Welch, a close friend, who asked if Haeggman could
undertake an 18-month study of reforestation in Finland through his
company.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said he sent a memo that same day to David Johnson, the
bid committee vice president, setting out what he understood about
the proposal, but heard nothing more of Haeggman.
</P>
<P>
   Pirjo Haeggman resigned from the IOC last month after it was
revealed that her husband had worked for the Salt Lake bid
committee and that he had also been hired in a forestry job in
Canada, while having his rent paid by the Toronto committee that
unsuccessfully bid on the 1996 Summer Games. Attempts to reach the
Haeggmans Thursday were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   Joklik, who resigned on Jan. 8 as president of the Salt Lake
City committee, has said that he knew nothing of the assistance
provided to IOC members and their families. Telephone calls
Thursday to him and his attorney seeking comment were not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, Joklik has said through his lawyer that the
``details'' of the bid work were handled by Welch and Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Details continued to emerge Thursday that appear to show that
gift-giving to IOC members was frequent and out in the open. In
July 1990, for instance, while Salt Lake City was unsuccessfully
pursuing the 1998 Winter Games, the Mormon capital's first official
visit by an IOC member was made by Slobodan Filipovic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Former Utah Lt. Gov. W. Val Oveson presented a Winchester
.30-.30, the rifle that won the West, to Filipovic, who would die
of cancer on June 15, 1995, a day before Salt Lake City won the
right to play host to the 2002 Games.
</P>
<P>
   Oveson said he recalled giving Filipovic a gun, but had no idea
what it was worth and had no part in planning the presentation of
the gift. During his eight years as lieutenant governor, he said,
he frequently was the host for Olympic-related events and that
gift-giving was part of his duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never felt anything was excessive,'' said Oveson, who is now
national taxpayer advocate for the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, who has been critical of scholarships
and cash payments made to IOC members, said in an interview
Thursday that he was frequently called upon in Salt Lake City and
abroad to present gifts to IOC delegates. Often, he said, he did
not know what the gifts were beforehand and was not told what they
cost.
</P>
<P>
   A Salt Lake City bid official said the governor gave such gifts
as clocks and expensive luggage. IOC members are prohibited from
receiving gifts with a value greater than $200. It could not be
learned whether the price of the gifts exceeded this amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not inconceivable that I gave away luggage,'' Leavitt
said. ``I did whatever I was asked to do at the time I was asked to
do it. I had no idea what the rules of the IOC were. If there were
in fact gifts given in violation of IOC protocol, I would have had
no context to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had not personally seen anything involving gifts
that appeared to him to be unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that as being the problem here,'' Leavitt said.
The problem, he said, ``are these so-called scholarships and cash
payments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Were the IOC's expectations higher than reasonable? Yes.''
Leavitt said. ``Did they operate in an atmosphere of opulence? Yes.
Did I feel comfortable with that? The answer to that is no.''
</P>
<P>
   In a trip that was emblematic of the complex mix of interests in
Salt Lake City's bid effort, the governor and his mother, Anne
Leavitt, traveled with six other passengers to the 1994 Winter
Games in Lillehammer, Norway, on a private jet that the governor
said was owned by Leucadia, a corporation that owns one of the
resorts which will be used for Olympic skiing and snowboarding in
Park City, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   On board the same plane, arranged by the Salt Lake City bid
committee, was a cargo of $21,000 in used medical equipment
intended for the son of an IOC delegate from Algeria. Leavitt said
he knew nothing of the cargo.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the Salt Lake City contingent in Norway said that
Leavitt's plane arrived at a small airport 90 minutes from
Lillehammer at noon on Feb. 11, 1994, and that the medical
equipment was unloaded from the plane in duffel bags.
</P>
<P>
   An invoice included in Salt Lake City bid documents shows that
medical instruments valued at $21,725 were transferred from Thomas
D. Rosenberg, a prominent Salt Lake City orthopedic surgeon, to the
bid committee on Dec. 23, 1993. A flight manifest detailed the same
items.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg was a close friend of Welch, the bid committee
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Salt Lake City committee files include a letter from
Rosenberg to Yacine Zerguini, a surgeon from Algeria, about a
possible visit to Utah. Yacine Zerguini is the son of Mohamed
Zerguini, an IOC member.
</P>
<P>
   Both Zerguinis attended the Olympics in Lillehammer, bid
committee officials said. Rosenberg, through his secretary,
declined to comment, citing ongoing investigations of the Salt Lake
City bid practices. Yacine Zerguini could not be reached in El
Biar, Algeria. His father, Mohamed Zerguini, who has not been
implicated in the IOC's investigation of the Salt Lake City
scandal, said in an interview from Algeria that ``I'm not aware of
that.''

<P>
   When King Hussein began his initial six months of cancer
treatment at the Mayo Clinic last year, his younger brother Hassan
should have cast his mind back to the day, 43 years earlier, when
another trusted servant of the monarchy believed he was secure in
his job.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein was only 21 but had already argued brusquely with
Lieutenant General Sir John Bagot Glubb, commander of his Arab
Legion and principal military adviser to his majesty.
</P>
<P>
   Glubb had disagreed with Hussein over military strategy _ the
young king wanted to retaliate against the Israelis for raids on
his border _ and Glubb also presented Hussein with a list of Arab
Legion officers whom he claimed were ``subversives'' and should be
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Persuaded by his own confidants that Glubb Pasha should be
dismissed, and convinced that the British were trying to control
Jordan's armed forces, the king fired the 59-year old British
general. Glubb Pasha was taken to the airport the next morning in
Hussein's own car.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring this historical precedent, Crown Prince Hassan used his
regency last year to boost his own image, to project his rule in
the Jordanian press and to demand the firing of Hussein's chief of
staff.
</P>
<P>
   To the sick king in Minnesota, his brother Hassan was trying to
take over the army _ just as Glubb was trying to do in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   But Hassan could not be packed off to Amman airport. Instead,
the king came home, disgraced his brother and picked another
Sandhurst graduate as regent _ a man, ironically, of whom Glubb
Pasha would have approved _ Hussein's eldest son, Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, however, it is fair to ask why we were surprised
by the suddenness of the political upheaval in Amman. The
Hashemites have always lived on the edge, provoking disaster and
recovery with a drama and nerve that astonishes other Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   They have a tendency to move rapidly between rage and
contemplation, political folly and eternal friendship that might be
a characteristic of the Gulf Arabs rather than the Levant.
</P>
<P>
   But Hussein's family does, indeed, come from the Gulf, from the
province of Hejaz, and it was his great-grandfather (also Hussein)
whom the Ottomans named as emir, sheriff of the holy Muslim city of
Mecca.
</P>
<P>
   An austere religious group faithful to the al-Saud family _ the
``Islamic fundamentalists'' of their time _ were to drive the
Hashemites from what was to become Saudi Arabia, and Winston
Churchill was to appoint King Hussein's grandfather Abdullah as
emir of Transjordan.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah had wanted to be King of Palestine (for which the
British had other plans). Abdullah's brother, Feisel, would become
King of Iraq _ a consolation prize for losing the monarchy of Syria
(for which the French had other plans).
</P>
<P>
   King Abdullah tried to make peace with the Zionists who were
planning their new state on Palestinian land _ and after the
Palestinian catastrophe of 1948, the monarch's life was forfeit.
</P>
<P>
   He had annexed the West Bank of the Jordan River; almost all the
rest of Palestine had become Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-year old Hussein personally witnessed Abdullah's
assassination in Jerusalem, a killing organized by Palestinians,
but involving one of the Arab Legion's most trusted officers _ the
very man who had signed the cease-fire agreement for Jordan in
1948.
</P>
<P>
   The Hashemites were thus a family of loss, a dynasty used to
suspicion as well as resolution. They lost the Hejaz, lost the west
of Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad 10 years later, King Feisel the Second (grandson of
old Abdullah's brother, who had been appointed by the British) was
assassinated in a Baathist coup which, 20 years on, would bring
Saddam Hussein to power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, King Hussein _ in the greatest disaster of his career _
chose to join Egypt and Syria in their war against Israel, and was
driven out of East Jerusalem and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In less than half a century, therefore, the Hashemites had lost
the Hejaz, Iraq and all of Palestine. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 250 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the story of the Hashemites has become the story of
the Plucky Little King, who now lies dying in the Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   His English schooling naturally endeared him to the British who
admire courage in adversity. When he married Antoinette Avril
Gardiner, daughter of a Royal Engineers lieutenant colonel, in
1961, it felt as though Jordan had become a British protectorate
once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toni,'' who became Princess Muna, gave birth to two sons,
Abdullah _ now the crown prince _ and Feisel. She was the second of
four wives for a king whose marriages could be as dramatic and
turbulent as his nation's politics.
</P>
<P>
   He had divorced his first, older wife Dina within 18 months (the
Jordanian ambassador to Egypt delivered the king's goodbye letter
to the queen when she was visiting a sick relative in Cairo).
</P>
<P>
   The marriage to Toni foundered when his roving eye settled upon
the beautiful Alia Toucan, an employee of Royal Jordanian Airlines,
whose love for the king may have given him lasting peace of mind _
they married in 1972 _ had she not been killed in a helicopter
crash five years later.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, he married Lisa Halaby, who became Queen Noor, an
equally beautiful but forceful woman who physically towered over
the king and who developed a strong, and well-founded, distrust of
his introverted, over-intellectualizing brother Hassan (if he had
become king, it was said in Amman, she would have left Jordan). &QL;

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Having lost the West Bank, the king had to face the
consequences: Palestinian contempt, and what amounted to an
attempted coup d'etat by Palestinian guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   With a ruthlessness that has still not been fully acknowledged,
Hussein's Bedouin troops slaughtered their way through the
Palestinian camps of Jordan and crushed guerrilla power.
</P>
<P>
   Having learned from his rash decision to go to war in 1967, he
sat out the 1973 Middle East conflict in near-silence, maintaining
semi-secret contacts with Israeli leaders, just as his grandfather
had done.
</P>
<P>
   What he had, he would hold. The Plucky Little King would be a
friend of the West. When a Washington newspaper claimed that the
king had received millions from the CIA, the stories were
suppressed in Amman. &QL;

   If the middle brother Prince Mohamed seemed a little unstable in
his early years _ there was talk of mental illness _ he has settled
into the role of loyal servant, a bookish chess-player who has
often represented the king.
</P>
<P>
   Hassan, the youngest brother, married a Pakistani wife, and
devoted himself to Jordan's development before ambition took
control of his loyalty. A friend of the king once dangerously
compared him to Cecil Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   Until he heard the news of his brother's attempt to control the
army, Hussein never doubted that Hassan would succeed him. &QL;

   Long regarded as a pliable ``friend'' of the west, King Hussein
astonished his American allies by embracing Saddam Hussein _ quite
literally _ after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. Did he really believe
Saddam would ``liberate'' Jerusalem? Or that Jordan could survive
without the Gulf Arabs?
