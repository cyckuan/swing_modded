<HEADLINE> Drug Lord's Daughter Sentenced  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A judge gave a 16-year sentence to the
daughter of a Mexican drug lord who is imprisoned for killing a
U.S. drug agent, the Mexican attorney general's office said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ofelia Fonseca was convicted of drug trafficking in connection
with the seizure of 980 pounds of cocaine. The drugs were recovered
from a small plane intercepted by drug agents in the southern
Mexican state of Quintana Roo in January 1999, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Fonseca's husband and another man were convicted earlier on
similar charges and are each serving 21-year terms, the attorney
general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, is serving 30 years for
the torture and killing of Enrique Camarena, a U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agent. Prosecutors charged that Fonseca
Carrillo ordered the slaying. He was among two dozen people
convicted in 1985 in connection with the case.

<HEADLINE> New Government Takes Office in Fiji  </HEADLINE>
By ROHAN SULLIVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUVA, Fiji (AP) -- Fiji's president swore in a new Cabinet
Friday, moving to restore calm in the Pacific nation that has been
in turmoil since a May 19 coup.
</P>
<P>
   The government, led by Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, took
office two days after coup leader George Speight was arrested and a
day after the military said he might face treason.
</P>
<P>
   Qarase has pledged to strengthen indigenous Fijians' grip on
power in the Pacific island state -- the key demand of coup
plotters.
</P>
<P>
   In a nationwide address following his swearing in, Qarase also
promised a government of ''moderation, inclusion and compassion''
</P>
<P>
   But he said indigenous Fijians would be guaranteed a ''special
place in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet, which does not have a single ethnic Indian member,
replaces the ousted administration of Mahendra Chaudhry, Fiji's
first prime minister of Indian descent, who was toppled during the
two-month hostage standoff led by Speight.
</P>
<P>
   Although the new government is strongly nationalist, it contains
no close supporters of Speight, who stormed Parliament on May 19 in
the name of ethnic Fijian rights and unleashed a wave of civil
unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Speight had demanded the Cabinet be stacked with his followers
and allegedly threatened the life of President Ratu Josefa Iloilo
if that did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   But with every post except one held by ethnic Fijians, the
Cabinet met one of Speight's original demands -- that political
power in this Pacific island nation not slip into the hands of
Fiji's large ethnic Indian minority. The only non-Fijian was an
ethnic Indian named as a junior minister.
</P>
<P>
   Speight and an armed gang stormed the Parliament on May 19 and
took dozens of lawmakers hostage for two months to protest the
election of a prime minister of Indian descent.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of Speight supporters from the Cabinet is likely to
further anger Speight's supporters, who have already begun making
reprisals for the arrest Wednesday of Speight and hundreds of other
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, supporters kidnapped two New Zealand civilian
pilots in retaliation for Speight's arrest. The two were released
overnight, military spokesman Maj. Howard Politini said.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel supporters also briefly took up to 50 hostages in another
town on Vanua Levu, but released them after being warned of
military action, a military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated at continuing intimidation by Speight, who threatened
a new round of civil unrest unless he was given greater influence
over Fiji's next government, the military decided to move against
him and his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   After arresting Speight at a checkpoint, dozens of heavily armed
troops stormed a school in Suva early Thursday morning where
several hundred Speight supporters had been camped for the past two
weeks after they gave up control of Fiji's Parliament, where
Speight staged his coup.
</P>
<P>
   Military spokesman Lt. Col. Filipo Tarakinikini told a news
conference that Speight was arrested for threatening the life of
Fiji's new President, Ratu Josefa Iloilo, and for refusing to hand
in all weapons stolen from the army for his coup.
</P>
<P>
   Threatening Iloilo's life ''can be seen as an act of treason,''
and Speight could face such a charge after a full police
investigation, Tarakinikini said. The investigation is expected to
take up to a week.
</P>
<P>
   Launching an emergency budget aimed at curbing the economic
devastation wreaked by the coup, Qarase, who is currently caretaker
prime minister, promised Thursday to ''religiously pursue'' a
government blueprint which discriminates against ethnic Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fijians do not seek permanency as an expression of racial
superiority, their motivation is to ensure the survival of a small
and distinct race,'' Qarase said, adding that ''aggressive''
foreign critics such as Australia and New Zealand should leave Fiji
to solve its own problems.
</P>
<P>
   Australia, New Zealand and the United States are demanding the
restoration of democracy in Fiji and have imposed sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Speight claims ethnic Indians, who make up 44 percent of Fiji's
population, have too much power and are threatening Fijian culture.
The Indians were first brought to Fiji in the 1870s by British
colonialists as indentured laborers.

Campus Crusade for Christ chooses new leader after 50 years
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM (AP) -- Preacher and author Steve Douglass has been
named president of Campus Crusade for Christ, one of the world's
largest evangelical organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Founder and current head William R. Bright, 78, who led the
organization for almost five decades, announced the appointment in
the Netherlands, site of the Billy Graham Evangelistic
Association's Amsterdam 2000 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Douglass, 55, has worked for the group for three decades, most
recently as executive vice president and director of U.S.
ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Started in 1951 at the University of California, Los Angeles to
''show students how to know and experience God's love and plan for
their lives,'' Campus Crusade for Christ has 22,000 full-time staff
and more than 489,000 volunteers in 186 countries.
</P>
<P>
   All employees, including the president, raise financial support
to pay their salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Now headquartered in Orlando, Fla., the organization's 68
ministries and projects include evangelizing to 15 million
university students in the United States, developing Christian
athletes and providing ''biblical tools'' to strengthen marriages
and families. Among the group's more controversial projects: an ad
campaign telling homosexuals ''there is another way out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bright was the 1996 winner of the Templeton Prize for Progress
in Religion. He donated the $1.1 million prize toward training
Christians about the spiritual benefits of fasting and prayer.
Indians want state to give them confiscated hallucinogen
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Leaders of the Native American Church have
asked state investigators to hand over 3,500 peyote buttons seized
during an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Stark, who says he is a medicine man in the Oklevueha Earth
Walks chapter of the Native American Church, had the buttons before
police confiscated them July 8.
</P>
<P>
   Stark said as a spiritual leader, he is entitled to use and
share the hallucinogenic plant. However, other Native American
Church members claim he is an impostor.
</P>
<P>
   Weber County police and prosecutors, investigating Stark for
possible drug distribution charges, could destroy the peyote if a
court rules Stark had them illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders opposed destroying the peyote, which is eaten and
used to brew a tea during religious ceremonies in the church.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is so sacred, so precious to us,'' said Johnny Blackhorse,
president of A Shii-Be-To chapter of the Native American Church in
Salt Lake City. ''We call it 'Mother Peyote' because that is how we
feel about it. If somebody damages it, it would be like somebody
hurting your mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Peyote is a hallucinogenic cactus that grows in the limestone
soils of the Chihuahuan desert in Mexico. For generations, American
Indians have considered it integral to traditional religious
ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, use of peyote during ceremonies in
traditional American Indian religions is lawful.
Hebrew Academy hopes free tuition will lure top students
</P>
<P>
   GREENSBORO, N.C. (AP) -- A group working to create the nation's
first boarding high school for students from the Orthodox, Reform,
and Conservative branches of Judaism plans to offer free tuition
during the school's founding years.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to ensure the quality of the school and to ensure that
this would be available to any kid who could qualify for it,'' said
Rabbi Alvin Mars, the American Hebrew Academy's headmaster, who is
busy planning the school's curriculum and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The academy is scheduled to open in fall 2001 on a 100-acre
campus in northwest Greensboro. For the first year, the academy
will enroll 100 boarding students and an unspecified number of area
day students in the ninth grade. Classes will be limited to 12
students.
</P>
<P>
   During the first few years, students who are accepted by the
school and maintain high grades will be able to attend tuition-free
for the full four years of high school. Founders have yet to decide
when the school would begin asking students to pay their own way.
Groups sue over practice of religion-based job-training program
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Two civil rights groups have sued to
recover state money given to a church-based job-training program
and questioned state contracts that use religion-based programs to
help people get off welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed Monday in Travis County district court by the
American Jewish Congress and the Texas Civil Rights Project seeks
to recoup state funds given to the Jobs Partnership of Washington
County. The lawsuit said the program used state money to purchase
Bibles and promoted evangelical Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   An evaluation by state agency employees stated that biblical
references were used to teach subjects such as attitude, integrity,
and money, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They teach that you can find a job through a relationship
through Jesus Christ,'' said Jim Harrington, director of the Texas
Civil Rights Project. ''That's a bit much.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit names the Texas Department of Human Services,
commissioner Eric Bost and other state officials as defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The jobs program in Brenham, about halfway between Austin and
Houston, received $8,000 in state funds in 1999. It no longer
receives any state money, said the Rev. George Nelson, who sits on
the program's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit also challenges the constitutionality of the
''charitable choice'' contract -- which allows the state to give
money to religious groups for job training and other services to
former welfare recipients so long as secular alternatives are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson supports such efforts. ''We are doing what we've been
called to do and that's help those who are less fortunate,'' he
said. ''Anybody who's against that, I would pray for them.''
Mormon church evacuates missionaries from Fiji
</P>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The Mormon church has pulled missionaries
out of Fiji due to continuing unrest there, church officials
announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has nearly 200
missionaries on Fiji, which has experienced increasing ethnic
division and political strife.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign missionaries were sent to New Zealand, and those with
Fijian citizenship will remain and continue their work ''in areas
of the island unaffected by recent disturbances,'' church spokesman
Randy Ripplinger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mormon church has 58,600 missionaries around the world. Most
are young men, who serve for two years, and young women, who serve
for 18 months. Couples also serve field missions for six to 30
months.

<HEADLINE> Episcopalians Take Stand on Energy  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH KOHLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- When people ask why the Episcopal Church promotes
renewable energy, the Rev. Sally Bingham mentions Noah. She refers
to his saving the animals from the flood as the first ''endangered
species act.''
</P>
<P>
   Bingham, head of the environmental ministry at Grace Cathedral
in San Francisco, said, ''The covenant between God and Noah was for
generations to come and that covenant was for every living thing,
not just humans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bible calls people to be good stewards of the Earth, she
said, explaining the basis for a growing movement linking faith and
environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bingham founded Episcopal Power and Light, a
California-based group that works with churches that want to switch
to green power: wind, solar or geothermal energy.
</P>
<P>
   Many churches, including Grace Cathedral, have contracted with
Vermont-based Green Mountain Energy, generally in markets where the
utility industry has been deregulated.
</P>
<P>
   The California Council of Churches plans to start California
Interfaith Power and Light in September. The organization would be
patterned after the Episcopal group.
</P>
<P>
   Churches in other states, including New Jersey and Maine, have
used Episcopal Power and Light as a model to cut the use of fossil
fuels. The carbon dioxide created by burning coal and oil is blamed
for global warming and other environmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Bingham said she believes it's up to churches to set an example.
The Episcopal Church passed a resolution in 1997 urging members to
conserve energy.
</P>
<P>
   And the church brokered a deal to run its 10-day national
convention in Denver earlier this month on renewable energy.
</P>
<P>
   The convention, which drew about 15,000 people, is believed to
be the first such national gathering to go all green.
</P>
<P>
   ''It allowed us to put our faith into action,'' Bingham said.
</P>
<P>
   She and Steve MacAusland of Boston, head of the Committee on
Faith and the Environment for the Episcopal Diocese of
Massachusetts, negotiated with Public Service Co. of Colorado to
use wind power generated by the utility's wind farm in the northern
part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity to the convention center flowed from the power
grid, a network of power producers and consumers. So, the wind
power bought by the Episcopal Church may have actually helped homes
throughout the Denver area keep cool.
</P>
<P>
   ''Basically, they're sponsoring our ability to provide wind
power,'' Public Service spokeswoman Jessica Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Public Service charges an extra $2.50 for a block of 100
kilowatt hours of wind power because it costs more than
conventional energy to produce. Anderson said a household uses an
average of 600 kilowatt hours a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church paid about $11,000 more for the renewable
energy. But Bingham said it amounted to only about 10 cents extra a
day per person.
</P>
<P>
   Episcopal Power and Light has provided a blueprint for other
conventions, said Scott Ingvoldstad, spokesman for the Colorado
branch of the conservation group Environmental Defense, formerly
known as the Environmental Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The group has been important in raising awareness about
renewable energy, said Suzie Quinn, spokeswoman for Green Mountain
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The church affiliations are a wonderful network for us,'' she
said. ''Their platform for environmental stewardship is a powerful
connection for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Green Mountain does not produce electricity, but sells power
from renewable energy sources to about 100,000 customers in
California, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. As more churches and their
members sign up, the demand for clean energy will grow and more
wind and solar plants will be built, Quinn said.
</P>
<P>
   The church is the perfect institution to lead the way, Bingham
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Senate is not going to pass the Kyoto protocol, or if
the government has difficulties with it,'' she said, referring to a
greenhouse-gas reduction plan agreed to by many nations at a 1997
meeting in Kyoto, Japan, ''we believe the church can get this
done.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Some people think the environment is a political issue the
church shouldn't be involved with,'' Bingham said.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, ''People of faith have a responsibility to keep
air and water clean.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Jesus was an active person,'' Bingham said. ''Praying about
clean water and air is fine. But taking action to make sure the air
and water are clean, that's where we put our faith into action.''

<HEADLINE> Feds Unveil Plans for Saving Salmon  </HEADLINE>
By JEFF BARNARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- The federal government has released its
long-awaited plan for saving Columbia Basin salmon from extinction,
calling it the biggest ecosystem restoration project since the
spotted owl.
</P>
<P>
   Indian tribes and environmentalists said the plan announced
Thursday fell far short of what is needed. There is a 60-day public
comment period before the plan can become final.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the strategy was designed to benefit all
12 salmon runs in the basin listed as threatened and endangered
species, and was the best plan that could get support from
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But they acknowledged that it left out the immediate breaching
of four dams in southeastern Washington, omitting the single best
thing that could be done for salmon in the Snake River,
</P>
<P>
   George Frampton, acting chair of the White House Council on
Environmental Quality, said the strategy concentrated on actions
likely to have the greatest benefit for the most species and held
out the possibility of dam breaching if they don't work.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy will be evaluated after five, eight and 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Removing dams built on the lower Snake in the 1970s would cut
off barge transport of grain and other freight between Lewiston,
Idaho, and the Columbia, lower reservoirs below irrigation intake
pipes and reduce Northwest electricity supplies by about 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Columbia Basin Indian tribes called the strategy a declaration
of war. They warned they would go to court and even begin civil
disobedience to enforce their treaty rights to salmon for
ceremonial, subsistence and commercial fishing if the strategy is
not changed to include dam breaching and other measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today I told Mr. Frampton that he leaves me with but one
choice. To fight back,'' said Antone Minthorne, chairman of the
Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla. ''To defend my people, my
religion and my culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists said the plan lacked the ''hard triggers''
necessary to change things that have been killing salmon for
decades, and specific sources of funding to pay for programs or
water to augment river flows.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a skeleton right now, but there is no meat and it
ain't walking or talking,'' said Glen Spain of the Pacific Coast
Federation of Fishermen's Associations.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of the remaining salmon habitat in the entire
Columbia Basin is behind the four Snake River dams, making
breaching the most important habitat improvement issue before the
federal government, said Scott Bosse of Idaho Rivers United.
</P>
<P>
   Industrial river uses such as barge operators, aluminum smelters
and irrigators were unhappy because the strategy lacks firm
estimates of costs, benefits or funding sources, said Bruce Lovelin
of the Columbia River Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Frampton said the salmon strategy was more complex than the
Northwest Forest Plan, which cut logging on national forests by 90
percent to protect habitat for the northern spotted owl and other
species.
</P>
<P>
   Among the habitat improvements were proposals to get more water
from Canada and buy water from Idaho farmers to increase flows in
rivers. The water would increase survival in small rivers and allow
more fish to spill over dams rather than swim through deadly
turbines.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcheries would move from concentrating on producing large
numbers of fish to minimizing harm to wild stocks, producing fish
better able to survive in the wild, and serving as a safety net for
runs on the brink of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   It also proposes capping harvest rates on species protected by
the Endangered Species Act and suggests buyouts of commercial
fishing licenses and the elimination of gill nets.

<HEADLINE> San Diego Utility Rates Skyrocket  </HEADLINE>
By KIMBERLY LAMKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Deregulating utilities and creating competition
in the power market was supposed to be a boon for California
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Nora Whitcotton, one of about 1.2 million customers of San Diego
Gas &AMP; Electric, the first utility in the state to deregulate, said
it's meant just the opposite. She's among the utility's customers
whose monthly bills have skyrocketed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   While a power-supply crunch coupled with increased demand are
partly to blame for rising bills, customers and critics of the
utility said their plight should serve as a warning to other states
wrestling with deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Whitcotton, who lives on a fixed monthly income of $712, saw her
July energy bill jump from $46 a year ago to $117.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to see it go back to being regulated,'' she said. ''I
don't mind conserving energy and using less, but I really believe
we were sold a bill of goods with deregulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis entered the fray Thursday, calling on federal
and state regulators to lower price caps on the state's electric
rates and refund $100 million to San Diego ratepayers.
</P>
<P>
   Davis called the San Diego rates ''unjust and totally
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 state law ordered restructuring of the electric services
market to break utilities' monopoly power and introduce
competition, a scenario that is playing out nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Under deregulation, power generators are supposed to compete to
offer energy to distributors, who then compete to deliver that
energy to consumers. Competition was supposed to lower bills by 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Diego area, however, competition among distributors
is largely nonexistent because there are too few companies, and
rates have soared since San Diego Gas deregulated a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''San Diego should charge tuition for this class, 'Botched
Deregulation 101,''' said Michael Shames, executive director of the
Utility Consumers Action Network. ''Other states would be stupid to
not look at us and then let this situation repeat itself.''

<P>
   Utility officials acknowledge that deregulation isn't working.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some things need to be fixed both on the supply side and the
buy side of the process,'' said Gary Cotton, a senior vice
president at the company.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of new power plants and the absence of a policy to manage
distribution when power lines are congested are major barriers to
successful deregulation, he added.
</P>
<P>
   As a short-term solution, San Diego-area consumer groups have
called for a rate freeze, and government disaster assistance. A
long-term fix, some advocates said, would be re-regulating the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   In California, deregulation is expected to expand in 2002, after
a rate freeze for customers is lifted for a number of publicly
owned utilities.

<HEADLINE> Two records fall as Empire State Games get under way  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN KEKIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BINGHAMTON, N.Y. (AP) - A month ago, Robert Jahrling was in a
car accident. Two weeks later, a car hit him and broke two ribs
while he was running near his Wurtsboro home.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was no point in training,'' he said. ''I had to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly the best way to get ready for the open men's
decathlon at the Empire State Games. Then again, Jahrling is not
your ordinary athlete. He keeps coming back for more punishment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came in second last year, and second the year before that,
and second the year before that,'' said the 26-year-old Jahrling,
who won the high jump (6 feet, 5 inches) on Thursday and was second
in the long jump before fading to ninth in the 400 meters and
finishing the first day in sixth place for Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Wilson of Long Island, who won the 100-meter dash (in
11.36 seconds) and long jump (22.5 feet), also took the 400 (in
51.39) and had 3,491 points, 103 more than Ryan Williams of
Central. In third, another 90 points back, was Jeff Moulton, also
of the Hudson Valley region. Just ahead of Jahrling were Toby
Eddison of New York City and Daniel Van Horne of Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ''These guys are tough,'' said an exhausted Jahrling, who was
looking forward to Friday's pole vault at Binghamton University.
''This hurts worse than the car accident. These guys came out of
nowhere. I've never seen 'em before. But I'll catch up tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those guys was Williams, who wasn't looking forward to
another day of agony.
</P>
<P>
   ''My second day is terrible,'' said Williams, who finished just
ahead of Jahrling in the 400 to fall from first to second in the
standings. ''But you never know what can happen in the decathlon.
Anybody in the top six probably has a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson wasn't exactly brimming with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a real bad time of it on the second day in the
qualifier,'' he said. ''I just want to be consistent and let things
take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The decathlon can be oh-so-demoralizing, and nobody was more
aware of that on Thursday than Anthony Jefferies of Allegany in the
Western region.
</P>
<P>
   First after three events in the scholastic men's competition,
Jefferies dipped to second after the high jump, then had a
disastrous 400 and fell to fifth, 330 points behind the leader,
Matthew Spaccarelli of Hopewell Junction in the Hudson Valley
(2,895). Michael Couch of Adirondack was second (2,794), and Chad
Caldwell of Long Island third, only another eight points behind.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did horrible in the 400 and I know I can do better,''
Jefferies said. ''But I can make that up in one event. I think I'll
be good. I'm strong in field events. I should be able to pick it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   One who did pick it up on Thursday was Nathan Jauvtis of Ithaca,
who cleared 17 feet, three-quarters of an inch to break the ESG
record in the pole vault and give Central another gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew from warmups that things were going all right,'' said
Jauvtis, who just completed his first year of doctoral studies in
mechanical engineering at Cornell University and hardly trained for
this competition. ''I hadn't planned on doing what I did today.
Guess I'll have to get a new shopping list.''
</P>
<P>
   Jauvtis easily broke the record of 16-6 set in 1995 by Mike
Thompson of Chenango Forks, also in the Central region. By the time
Jauvtis missed, at 17-4&AMP;frac34;, a small throng was cheering his every
move, including Scott Lundy, another Cornell student, who finished
second and snapped a photo of the winner afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew I could do it. I just had to put it together,'' Jauvtis
said. ''It's one thing to jump in practice and do pretty well. It's
another thing to do it in a meet. I'm just really psyched.''
</P>
<P>
   Only minutes after Jauvtis finished, another ESG record fell,
this one in the hammer throw for scholastic men. JP Smolenski of
New Hyde Park, Long Island, had a toss of 198 feet to eclipse the
record of 186-6 set by Adirondack's Steven Dering way back in 1986.
It wasn't close to his personal best of 202-5, but that was OK.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not complaining,'' said Smolenski, whose father, Ed, won
gold in the event at the inaugural Empire State Games in 1978.
''I'm happy I've done it.''
</P>
<P>
   By evening, the Western region had 11 gold medals and was atop
the medal count with 33. Central was second with 26 medals, seven
of them gold, and Long Island had 21 medals, 11 of them gold.
Adirondack was next with 19 medals including five gold, followed by
New York City with 14 total and six gold. Hudson Valley had a dozen
medals, four of them gold.
</P>
<P>
   The scholastic women's high jump had a familiar happy face atop
the podium. Toni-Lee McDaniels of Oneonta in the Central region won
her third straight gold medal, clearing 5 feet, 3.8 inches to edge
Micha Simon of Paul Robeson High School in Brooklyn and Siobhan
Fogarty of Cortlandt Manor in the Hudson Valley. All three cleared
the same height; McDaniels won because she had fewer misses.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, McDaniels could have soared higher, but a certain part
of her anatomy kept getting in the way.
</P>
<P>
   ''At camp, (former world record holder) Dwight Stones told me I
should be a 6-foot jumper, if I could just get my butt in the
air,'' said McDaniels, who left immediately to compete in the
National Junior Olympics in Buffalo on Friday morning. ''That
really wasn't what I wanted to hear. It kind of made me angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Oneithea Lewis of Port Washington, Long Island, switched events
this year and still was golden. A year after she won the open
women's shot put, Lewis finished first in the discus with a throw
of 129 feet, 1 inch. Elizabeth Shope of Rochester took silver for
the Central region and Amanda Miller of Ithaca copped bronze, also
for Central.
</P>
<P>
   In the open men's javelin, Don Ampansiri of Catskill took gold
for the Adirondack region, easily beating Steve Jochum of the
Hudson Valley region and Edward Hausdo of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Kaisa Ajaye of Manhattan captured the open women's 10-kilometer
racewalk in 56 minutes, 52.4 seconds, beating Laura Feller of
Carthage in the Central region by more than a minute and a half.
Christine Quirke of Long Island took bronze.
</P>
<P>
   In the open men's 10k racewalk, Allen James of Clifton Park won
gold for Adirondack in 44:56.1, beating Western's Dave Lawrence, of
Kenmore, by nearly eight minutes. Bill Vayo of Scarsdale took
bronze for the Hudson Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the men's scholastic long jump final, Trumaine Pendleton of
Southampton, Long Island, won gold, while Marquis Harrison of
Latham took silver and Kevin Ferrone of Mechanicville got bronze
for Adirondack.
</P>
<P>
   Allie Silverman of New York City won the scholastic women's
10,000-meter race in 40:46.41, and Jesse Rappole of the Western
region won the first medal of the games, capturing the 10,000-meter
run for scholastic men in 33:56.40.

Gunman Takes Pilots Hostage at JFK
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man armed with a handgun was apparently holding a pilot
and co-pilot hostage on board a National Airlines jet at John F. Kennedy
International Airport on Thursday night, a New York police spokesman said. There
were no passengers believed to have remained on the jet, and no injuries were
immediately reported. WNBC-TV reported that passengers had been let off the
plane, but that could not immediately be confirmed. Detective Edward Reuss said
the man, who was not immediately identified, ran from the terminal onto the
plane with some kind of handgun about 10 p.m.

Congress OKs $288 Billion Defense Spending Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon would get $20 billion more money next year --
including a 3.7 percent military pay increase -- under a $288 billion Pentagon
spending bill that Congress is sending President Clinton. The Senate passed the
bill on a 90-10 vote Thursday after Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, objected to $1.8 billion added to the package by a select group of
Appropriations Committee members that was not in either House or Senate versions
of the bill passed earlier.

Britain Cyber-Snooping Bill To Become a Law
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Legislation allowing the British government to track e-mails
and seize encrypted Internet communications has passed its final hurdle in
Parliament. The law, hailed by the government as a bulwark against organized
crime but condemned by civil libertarians as the harbinger of an Orwellian
state, was approved by the House of Commons on Wednesday evening. After the
formality of a royal signature, it will become law on Friday. The measure
enables law-enforcement authorities to demand records of Internet traffic and
view the content of encrypted messages.

FTC Backs Internet Privacy Deal
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to ease public concerns about online privacy, the
government Thursday approved a plan drafted by Internet advertisers to regulate
the gathering of information used to profile Web customers. The Federal Trade
Commission voted 4-1 to endorse a self-regulatory plan submitted by the Network
Advertising Initiative, a consortium of major Internet advertising companies.
Privacy advocates objected, calling it ''written by industry for industry'' and
saying it fails to adequately address the issue. The plan takes effect
immediately but still contains vague language with few details.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- More than 10,000 opponents of President Alberto Fujimori
on Thursday staged one of the biggest protests yet against his decade in power,
rallying on the eve of his inauguration for an unprecedented third term after a
tainted re-election. The peaceful overnight outpouring against Fujimori's
inauguration united workers, students, and Peruvians from all walks in a
raucous, torchlit rally, marked by bottle rockets screaming over a downtown

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A Poll of likely voters released Thursday shows George
W. Bush and running mate Dick Cheney have opened up an 11-point lead over Al
Gore just days before the start of the Republican National Convention. The
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll showed Bush at 50 percent and Gore at 39 percent, with
Green Party candidate Ralph Nader at 4 percent and Reform Party contender Pat
Buchanan at 1 percent. Gore had closed the gap with Bush just a week ago in the

<HEADLINE> Gonzalez Enjoys Return to Texas  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MARSHALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Fans witnessed a rare sight Thursday
night in Texas -- Juan Gonzalez signing autographs during batting
practice.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game back in Texas since being traded by the
Rangers to the Detroit Tigers during the offseason, Gonzalez was
all smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Fans took advantage of the occasion, forming a line that
extended from the field to the top of the lower section to get the
signature of their former hero, who accommodated them for about 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez later rewarded his fans with a three-run homer in the
fourth inning to give the Tigers a 3-0 lead. He made a slow trot
around the bases, and was cheered as he approached the plate.
</P>
<P>
   That changed to boos in the eighth inning when Gonzalez came up
with two on and the Rangers by four runs. He flied out to end the
inning and finished 1-for-3 with an intentional walk as Detroit
lost 7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez refused interview requests before and after the game,
but spoke fondly of his time in Texas in a statement handed out by
his adviser Luis Mayoral, a former Rangers employee.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming back to Texas, where I have so many friends and family
is something very important to me,'' the statement said. ''I spent
14 great years with the Texas Rangers organization and my time at
the major league level was full of great moments, and I know that I
always gave the Rangers my best.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez played nine full seasons and parts of two others in the
majors for the Rangers. He left as a two-time MVP and the Rangers
all-time leader in seven categories, including home runs, RBIs and
runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez was in the starting lineup in his first game back,
hitting fourth as the Tigers designated hitter. He was greeted with
a mixture of cheers and boos during pregame announcements, then
doffed his cap to cheers as he strode to the plate for the first
time to lead off the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers unloaded Gonzalez in November in a nine-player deal
so they wouldn't lose him without compensation. Gonzalez is a free
agent at the end of this season and the Rangers were worried his
asking price would be too high.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez turned down an eight-year, $148 million deal from the
Tigers in the spring and also nixed a trade with the Yankees in
June because New York would only offer him a one-year deal -- worth
$12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the lofty numbers the Rangers feared, but now it
looks Gonzalez will have a hard time fetching that kind of money.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez entered Thursday's game hitting .275 with 13 home runs
and 33 RBIs, and has missed 32 games due to injuries. He is also a
year removed from refusing to play in the All-Star Game and
skipping the Hall of Fame exhibition game because his pants didn't
fit.
</P>
<P>
   The lower production and the baggage that accompanies the star
player may have dropped Gonzalez's stock, but it could also put him
back in the Rangers price range.
</P>
<P>
   It could be a good fit if Gonzalez is receptive.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Rangers first baseman Rafael Palmeiro said he
would consider restructuring his contract if it meant Gonzalez
returning to Texas, and owner Tom Hicks said he would be interested
in signing him for the right price.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not making any offers, but if they want to talk about
options, I'm willing to talk about options,'' said Palmeiro, who
ruined his friend's homecoming with a three-run homer in the
seventh inning that led to a 7-3 Texas victory. ''I want people to
know that I am interested in having Juan return.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez said Tuesday he would only return to Detroit if the
fences at Comerica Park are moved in, but indicated Thursday that
he would like to stay with the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I now have a new family,'' Gonzalez's statement said. ''I like
the Detroit area and I enjoy our fans. The Tigers family ... have
treated me with great respect along with my teammates and they have
to be behind me since day one.''

<HEADLINE> Atler Has Been Here Before  </HEADLINE>
By EDDIE PELLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- It was an all-too-familiar scenario for Vanessa
Atler.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as she jumps onto those uneven bars, bad things happen.
</P>
<P>
   Atler opened the U.S. Gymnastics Championships on her
least-favorite apparatus Thursday night and the trouble began
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   On one spin, her legs wobbled, struggling mightily to get
perpendicular to the ground -- an awkward moment that brought a hush
over the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Just moments later, a haunting repeat.
</P>
<P>
   These struggles are nothing new to Atler at nationals.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, she went from sole leader to co-champion after falling
off the bars. She lost the title to Kristen Maloney in 1998 and
1999 because of the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   At least this time, the mistake came early. After scoring an
8.800 on the bars, she had a good remainder of the night to climb
into sixth place. She'll have a chance to make up more ground
Saturday in the finals.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always hard coming back, but I'm used to that,'' Atler
said with a laugh. ''It was pretty familiar.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   VETERAN'S SLIP-UP: John Roethlisberger has been doing this too
long to start second guessing himself.
</P>
<P>
   He liked his game plan on every event he competed in Wednesday,
including the one he messed up.
</P>
<P>
   He fell twice on his floor routine, the second time nearly
hitting his face on the mat. The result: a score of 7.950.
Suddenly, the 30-year-old gymnast who was supposed to challenge for
the national title found himself in sixth place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I did what I needed to do,'' Roethlisberger said. ''I was
aggressive. I went after each routine. I can't worry about it. I've
just got to approach the meet the same way Friday that I did
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The top 14 men advance to the Olympic trials in Boston next
month. The first four spots on the men's Olympic team will be
chosen by combining the scores from nationals (40 percent) and
trials (60 percent). Two more spots will be chosen by the men's
committee.
</P>
<P>
   A two-time Olympian with more experience than anyone,
Roethlisberger would seem a sure bet to at least get one of the
wild-card spots.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not a scenario he wants to think about.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've just got to go back to what I've done all the time,'' he
said. ''I've got to keep pushing forward, scratching and doing what
I've been doing. I made a mistake. There's nothing I can do about
it now.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   FASHION PLATE: Blonde hair is out, tongue bars are in,
according to Blaine Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky four-time national champion made news earlier this
year when he decided to ''clean up his act,'' selling his
motorcycle, removing the body piercings and generally trying to
project a more businesslike attitude to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the spring, he dyed his hair blonde. Later, he let that
grow out, but has since decided to replace the tongue bar that his
coaches and father had been asking him to take out.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just decided I was getting sick of what other people
think,'' Wilson said. ''It's not like I'm going to stick my tongue
out during the meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Wilson proved he can succeed no matter what
accessories he's wearing. He leads Sean Townsend by an impressive
1.20 points going into Friday night's finals.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   PEAKING: Stephen McCain may have been the happiest gymnast on
the floor Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Solid performances on every routine -- he had no score lower than
a 9.200 -- left him in third place after preliminaries, .025 points
behind Sean Townsend.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels like a mental maturity, a coming of age for me,'' he
said. ''I've gotten to where things that might have bothered me in
the past don't anymore. I'm at the point where I trust my body to
do whatever I need it to.''
</P>
<P>
   A member of the World Championship team, the 26-year-old Houston
native was considered a bubble candidate for the Olympic team. In
three tries, he has not finished higher than fifth at nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Could this be the year he takes the next step?
</P>
<P>
   ''The mental part is there,'' he said. ''Right now, the
potential feels limitless.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   ROPES AND MATS: The men's committee accepted petitions from
injured Chris Young (Achilles') and Yewki Tomita (shoulder). They
will both be eligible for the Olympic trials. ... Kristie Phillips,
the 1987 national champ who retired after missing the 1988 Olympic
team, continued her comeback at age 28. She's still feeling young.
''I ate off the kid's menu yesterday -- it was for 10 and under,''
Phillips said. ''I was very proud of myself. Tomorrow, I'm going to
try the movies.'' ... Amanda Stroud took a nasty spill off the
uneven bars, bringing a five-man medical crew onto the mat to check
her out. It looked like she had the wind knocked out of her. She
was helped to her feet and walked off under her own power.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Leaves Rehab Clinic  </HEADLINE>
By FRED GOODALL
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry will be interviewed Friday
to determine whether he violated probation after leaving a drug
clinic a month early and being photographed with a woman identified
as a member of a swingers' club.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Papy, regional director for the Florida Department of
Corrections, said Thursday night the New York Yankees outfielder
will be asked about the Sports Illustrated report that he has
visited a South Florida swingers' club on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point in time we are still gathering information,''
Papy said. ''We're waiting on a report from the treatment provider
and we want to get Strawberry's side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Papy said a report will be compiled and submitted to a judge,
who will decide if the 39-year-old slugger violated probation.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his probation on April 1999 charges of possessing
cocaine and soliciting a prostitute, Strawberry was ordered to not
frequent establishments where the main source of income is alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Trapeze II in Fort Lauderdale, which Sports Illustrated said the
eight-time All-Star joined last month, reportedly is a club in
which alcohol is not sold. Patrons, however, may bring their own,
and Strawberry will be asked whether he did.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry wrote a letter to commissioner Bud Selig several
weeks ago asking for reinstatement to baseball, a high-ranking
baseball official said Thursday on the condition he not be
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, serving his third drug-related suspension, asked for
an early end to his one-year ban, currently scheduled to run
through February.
</P>
<P>
   The baseball official confirmed that Strawberry left a clinic
where he was being treated for his cocaine problem, and returned to
his home in a gated community outside Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry told the New York Daily News that he left the
Sobrenity, Inc., clinic in Fort Lauderdale after 3&AMP;frac12; months because
he needs to support his wife and children and explore returning to
work in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Papy said leaving the clinic early could constitute a violation
of parole, but that it was too soon to speculate because
authorities had not received a report from Sobrenity, Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ''All we've heard is he said he left voluntarily,'' the
corrections official said, adding that Strawberry has been tested
for drugs three times a week since January and hasn't failed.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's agent, Eric Grossman, did not return telephone
messages from The Associated Press. However, officials of the St.
Paul, Minn., Saints minor league club confirmed there have been
discussions about hiring Strawberry.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints are the independent minor league team Strawberry
played for in 1996 when no big league club was interested in him.
General manager Bill Fanning said the club was talking to
Strawberry about an arrangement but nothing had been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Marvin Goldklang emphasized that Strawberry would not join
the Saints as a player. The minor league team also doesn't want to
give the impression it is trying to enhance his chances of
returning to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever we may do for Darryl Strawberry will have nothing to
do with whether he plays another baseball game,'' Goldklang said in
a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm assuming (he wants to return to baseball). Darryl hasn't
said that to me,'' the owner added. ''At this point in his life,
that's the thing he does best and wants to do. I'm assuming given
the opportunity he'd like to play again. That has nothing to do
with our relationship with Darryl.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldklang, also a Yankees limited partner, said an arrangement
might be made within a week or so, although it appears the closest
fans might come to seeing Strawberry play in St. Paul would be some
rounds of batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''We already have spoken to a physician and a counselor who are
familiar with Darryl's situation. It has been suggested to us that
that would be a positive element for Darryl because that would help
keep him in an environment where he does feel comfortable. That's a
distinct possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported that baseball has ''serious questions''
concerning Strawberry's fitness to resume his career.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 28, Strawberry was suspended by Selig after his third
violation of baseball's drug policy. The suspension came after
Strawberry had tested positive for cocaine during a routine check.
</P>
<P>
   After playing briefly with the Saints, Strawberry's contract was
purchased by the Yankees in July 1996. Two years later, the
outfielder was diagnosed with colon cancer and underwent surgery.
</P>
<P>
   While still undergoing chemotherapy, Strawberry returned to
baseball in March 1999. A month later, he was charged with
possessing cocaine and soliciting a prostitute. Pleading no
contest, Strawberry was sentenced to 18 months' probation and 100
hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the Yankees on Sept. 1, 1999, and finished the
season with a .327 batting average, three homers and six RBIs. In
the postseason, he hit .333 (5-for-15) with two homers and four
RBIs as the Yankees won their second straight World Series
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Goldklang said the Saints' interest in helping the slugger get
back on his feet is personal, not a publicity stunt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know there may be some skeptics out there who question why
we would do this for Darryl Strawberry,'' he said. ''I'm not
claiming that we never do things in our economic interest or
selfish interest. ... I think we are just motivated by caring for
another human being. He's been good to us in the past and we
remember our friends.''

<HEADLINE> Fujimori Opponents Protest  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- More than 15,000 opponents of President
Alberto Fujimori on Thursday staged one of the biggest protests yet
against his decade in power, rallying on the eve of his
inauguration for an unprecedented third term after a tainted
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful outpouring against Fujimori's inauguration united
workers, students and Peruvians from all walks in a raucous,
torchlit rally, marked by bottle rockets screaming over a downtown
plaza and drums pounding loudly in the cool night air.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democracy, yes! Dictatorship, no!'' the demonstrators chanted
as they marched huge red banners past the ornate Palace of Justice
that bore the word ''DEMOCRACIA'' in bold white letters. Others
wildly waved red-and-white Peruvian flags, chanting, ''Listen to
us! Listen now!'' while some waved a banner of revolutionary
Ernesto ''Che'' Guevara.
</P>
<P>
   It marked the start of a round of protests intended to culminate
with a march Friday morning against Fujimori's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are all gathered here to show our complete opposition to
this regime. What we want to tell the world is this: We don't want
our president any longer!'' said Luis Gonzalez, one of the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Riot police were not present for the gathering, which included
highlands Indians dancing with sombreros, mixing with middle-class
Peruvians, working-class laborers and university students.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the rally reached a fever pitch as highland Indians
blowing on cattle horns let loose an eerie wail before a
12-year-old girl stepped up to a dais and asked the crowd to take
an oath to defend democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peruvians, do you swear to fight without rest until the
dictatorship besieging our country is vanquished?'' Lucia Wiener
asked the thousands gathered with right arm raised.
</P>
<P>
   Those in the crowd shouted back with a roar: ''Yes, I swear!''
</P>
<P>
   One toddler held up a crudely penciled portrait of Fujimori
attached to the body of a rat. Others carried flaming torches or
the flag of the ancient Inca empire, in a rainbow of colors, while
Indian men danced with red sombreros and Indian women hawked
cookies from wicker baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want new elections. Fujimori won an election in which his
government made the rules and manipulated the outcome,'' said
Carola Ramirez, a 27-year-old biology student. ''We have been a
very patient people until now, but here we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, the opposition candidate who boycotted the May
28 election, crying fraud, vowed to discredit Friday's inauguration
by marching tens of thousands of people through downtown Lima in an
outpouring of ''peaceful resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, whose autocratic style is seen by critics as a
throwback to the Latin American dictatorships of old, has sent as
many as 40,000 police into the streets, tear gas launchers at the
ready in case of disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   While he said the rights of all citizens would be respected,
Fujimori warned he would not permit ''outbreaks against public
order.''
</P>
<P>
   International monitors have said the May 28 election did not
meet minimum standards of fairness, and they refused to lend it
legitimacy by overseeing it.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo charged that Fujimori, a bespectacled former university
rector first elected in 1990, has carried this South American
country into a personal dictatorship by pursuing another five-year
term.
</P>
<P>
   And he suggested the pro-democracy movement was now unstoppable.

strained left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   The move is retroactive to July 21. The Orioles will added a

<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
came to Thailand on Friday for the highest-level meeting between
U.S. and North Korea officials in a half-century of hostility. The
talks are expected to focus on the communist state's missile
program.
</P>
<P>
   Albright will likely press North Korean Foreign Minister Paek
Nam Sun for details on the North's recent offer to turn its efforts
to develop ballistic missiles into a program focused on the
peaceful launch of satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department described the talks as introductory, and
said no major deals were expected.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival, Albright paid a courtesy call on Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai before heading to a riverside hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also consulted the foreign minister of China,
Pyongyang's largest ally. They described their talks as ''very
good.'' She also was to see South Korea's Kim Jong-binn before
meeting Paek.
</P>
<P>
   She wore a canary yellow dress, similar to her last public trip
to Asia when a ''sunshine dress'' paid tribute to South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung's so-called sunshine policy to build peace
with the North.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said Washington could accept North Korean
satellites launched from neutral sites such as the South Pacific,
but has ruled out selling boosters or technology that could advance
the North's rocketry.
</P>
<P>
   The past two days have been a whirlwind of diplomacy for Paek.
He spoke Wednesday with South Korea's Lee Jong-binn in the
first-ever meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers.
Canada became the second Western country to extend diplomatic
relations to North Korea, and Australia promoted increased dialogue
with the communist state.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the ASEAN regional forum welcomed North Korea into
the group. The forum is comprised of the 10 members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and 13 other countries --
including the United States and Russia -- with security interests in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's inclusion ''reflects a common desire ... to
establish normal relations and promote amity and harmony,'' Paek
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russia, China and Vietnam banded together to oppose a
U.S. proposal to expand a planned missile system over Asia.
</P>
<P>
   First promoted as a means of protecting U.S. troops in Japan and
South Korea, the idea has expanded to all of East Asia, Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said after meeting Wednesday with U.S.
Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   The wider system would remove all ambiguity about whether the
shield would cover Taiwan and other disputed islands in the South
China Sea. Beijing views Taiwan as a renegade province and
considers U.S. attempts to defend it as interference in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jinxuan accused Washington of
promoting a ''cold war mentality'' and said the defense proposal
went ''against the tide of our times.''
</P>
<P>
   Talbott said later that the theater defense would ''not
necessarily'' include Taiwan. ''No decisions have been made in that
regard with respect to this region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and China also criticized the United States for pursuing
a national missile defense over its own territory, saying it would
violate arms control treaties and trigger a dangerous new arms
race.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott defended the national shield, calling it part of a
multi-pronged approach that includes deterrence and export controls
on technology.
</P>
<P>
   On other issues:
</P>
<P>
   -- The forum for the first time declared that nontraditional
security issues such as crime and trafficking in drugs, weapons and
human beings posed a threat to regional security.
</P>
<P>
   -- Globalization was cited as a source of security problems by
fueling upheaval following the 1997 Asian economic crisis,
especially in hard-hit Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   -- Australia and New Zealand, the biggest powers in the South
Pacific, welcomed the arrest of Fiji rebel leader George Speight,
but said the military authorities had to sustain their power or
face civil war.

<HEADLINE> Yankees Talk To Expos About White  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Yankees are talking to the Montreal
Expos about getting Rondell White for two prospects, but first want
to wait to see test results on the injured outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   If convinced White is healthy, the Yankees are prepared to send
infielder Alfonso Soriano, the jewel of their farm system, and
Triple-A pitcher Brandon Knight to the Expos, a high-ranking
baseball official said Thursday night, speaking on the condition he
not be identified.
</P>
<P>
   White has been out since July 8 because of a strained right
hamstring. He said he is scheduled for an MRI test on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are searching for a full-time left fielder, with
White, Baltimore's B.J. Surhoff, Milwaukee's Jeromy Burnitz and
Houston's Moises Alou prominently mentioned as possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's deadline for making trades without waivers is 4 p.m.
EDT Monday.
</P>
<P>
   White's name has frequently come up in trade rumors, with the
Yankees, Atlanta and Seattle supposedly interested. He is batting
.307 with 11 home runs and 54 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   White, a productive hitter who has been injury-plagued, has said
he would enjoy playing for the two-time World Series champion
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a business. The only time you can control what happens is
when you are a free agent,'' White said Thursday after the Expos
were swept in a doubleheader by the Mets at New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if you get traded, you always want to get to the best
team. It would be great,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York traded left fielder Ricky Ledee to Cleveland in a deal
for David Justice on June 29. Soon after, left fielder Shane
Spencer was lost for the season to an injured knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees recently has been active in the trade market, mostly
dealing prospects for veterans. Along with Justice, they have
acquired pitcher Denny Neagle from Cincinnati and outfielder-DH
Glenallen Hill from the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Soriano, 22, has been coveted by most every team that wants to
trade with New York.
</P>
<P>
   Knight, a 24-year-old right-hander, was acquired from Texas last
December in a trade for outfielder Chad Curtis.
</P>
<P>
   White began his major league career with the Expos and began
this season as a career .292 hitter. He has hit .300 the last two
years and averaged 22 homers in the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   White, 28, twice was on the disabled list because of a strained
right hamstring. He was slowed by tendinitis in his left knee
throughout spring training.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, his season was cut short on July 20 when broke his
right ring finger and tore ligaments in the finger trying to make a
catch.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, he missed 68 games after lacerating his spleen and
injuring his kidney trying to make a catch.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Expos made a four-player trade last December,
with pitcher Hideki Irabu going to Montreal.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Thursday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Devil Rays-Royals:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Manager Larry Rothschild served the second game of
his two-game suspension Thursday. He received the penalty for an
altercation with umpire Laz Diaz durin 2000. The Yankees have
historically struggled at the Metrodome, going just 28-27 at the
park in the 1990s. ... It will be a homecoming of sorts for Denny
Neagle when he starts Friday's game. He played at the University of
Minnesota was selected by the Twins in the third round of the 1989
free agent draft. He was 0-1 in seven games with Minnesota in 1991.
... LHP Allen Watson (shoulder) is scheduled to throw batting
practice Friday at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, Fla., and said he
might make a minor league rehab appearance early next week. ... RHP
Orlando ''El Duque'' Hernandez (elbow) reported no problems one day
after his first bullpen session since going on the 15-day DL. ...
Baltimore had a scout at a rookie Gulf Coast League game where INF
D'Angelo Jimenez, who is coming back from a broken bone in his
neck, made his second minor league rehab start.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Wednesday's rainout in Boston means that LHP J.C.
Romero will miss his scheduled start against the Yankees. He will
work out of the bullpen in this series. Romero was called up last
Sunday when RHP Mike Lincoln went on the DL with a bad elbow. ...
The Twins are 3-0-1 in their past four series, going 8-5 in those
games.
Tigers-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Closer Todd Jones entered Thursday night's game against
Texas with 117 saves as a Tiger, three short of Guillermo
Hernandez's 120, No. 3 in franchise history. Mike Henneman is the
career leader with 154 followed by John Hiller's 125. ... Detroit
went into Thursday night 19-16 vs. 1999 playoff teams.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: Manager Johnny Oates planned on giving closer John
Wetteland Thursday night off. Wetteland had appeared in a game four
straight nights, only the fifth time in his career he's had to
pitch four nights in a row. His total of seven blown saves tied
Anaheim's Troy Percival for the most in the league. ... LHP Mike
Venafro took a streak of 10 straight scoreless appearances into
Thursday night's game against the Tigers, a span of 7 1-3 innings.
... Frank Catalanotto's nine pinch-hits are the most for a Ranger
since Brian Downing had nine in the 1991 season. Bill Stein (1982)
and Kevin Reimer (1990) share the club record of 12.
Red Sox-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: A game against the Minnesota Twins, which was rained out
on Thursday, will be played Sept. 7. The Red Sox have had seven
games postponed because of rain this season. ... The Red Sox plan
to start newly acquired Rolando Arrojo on Sunday against Oakland's
Gil Heredia, and move Ramon Martinez's next start to Monday.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Rookie pitcher Mark Mulder will face Pedro Martinez on
Friday. A's manager Art Howe isn't nervous about putting the rookie
up against the formidable All-Star. ''Anyone can beat anyone on any
given day,'' Howe said. ''I'm not worried.'' ... The A's have gone
six straight games without an error, a season high. The A's
committed 27 errors in the first 16 games in July.
Blue Jays-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: The Blue Jays placed OF Raul Mondesi on the 15-day DL
(retroactive to July 22) because of ligament damage in his right
elbow. He was examined Thursday by Dr. Frank Jobe in Los Angeles.
He will undergo further tests on Friday to find out the extent of
the damage. Rob Ducey will fill the vacant roster spot. Ducey, an
outfielder, was acquired in a trade from Philadelphia for a player
to be named later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: RHP Gil Meche pitched for Triple-A Tacoma on Thursday.
He pitched four innings and allowed two hits and one unearned run.
He walked two and struck out seven against Albuquerque.
White Sox-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: This is the first time the White Sox have been in
Anaheim near the trading deadline since 1997, when the team dealt
Wilson Alvarez, Roberto Hernandez and Danny Darwin to San Francisco
despite being only three games behind first-place Cleveland in the
AL Central. ''A lot has changed,'' Frank Thomas said as the White
Sox took a 10-game lead into their series with the Angels.
''There's a lot of different teammates, and we've also had an
overall change in team attitude. But thinking that we were going to
win this fast? No. I didn't think we'd turn it around this fast,
but we did thanks to the trades.'' ... Barring a complete collapse,
the White Sox will set a club record for most consecutive days in
first place if they can hold their lead the rest of the season.
They have been atop the AL Central for the past 101 days with 65
days remaining. The previous club mark was 134 days -- by the 1919
team that engineered the ''Black Sox Scandal'' by throwing the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Kent Mercker, forced out of his start on May 11 because
of a cerebral hemorrhage, will make his first of four scheduled
rehab starts on Saturday at Stockton, Calif., for the Angels' Class
A Lake Elsinore team. A plane ride to Oakland, followed by a
75-mile drive to the ballpark, seems like a lot to go through to
make just 30 pitches, but Mercker has been through a lot worse just
to get to this point. ''It's is kind of in the middle of nowhere,
but I'm looking forward to it. I just want to pitch,'' said the
left-hander, who eventually will be stretched out for a role as a
spot-starter and long man in the bullpen. ''Naturally, I'd like to
go faster (in his rehab), but I guess I've got to start from there
and move up. They've got a plan for me. So if they only want me to
throw 30 pitches, I'll throw 30 pitches.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Expos-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: OF Rondell White, out since July 8 with a strained
right hamstring, will have an MRI on Friday. The Expos aren't sure
when he will return, although they hope to display him before the
July 31 trade deadline. Once again, White's name is being mentioned
in trade rumors with many teams. His first choice would be to come
to the New York Yankees. ''It's a business. The only time you can
control what happens is when you are a free agent. But if you get
traded, you always want to get to the best team. It would be
great.'' ... The Expos were swept at Shea Stadium for the first
time since June 25-27, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: SS Melvin Mora is day-to-day after breaking the nail
on his right index finger in the opener. ... OF Derek Bell left
both games early. He received three stitches in his chin after
being hit by a batted ball in the first inning of the opener and
left the second game with light headedness. He is expected to play
Friday. ... 3B Robin Ventura took BP before the game and could be
ready to return Saturday, the first day he is eligible to come off
the DL. ... OF Darryl Hamilton, out since the first week of the
season with a sprained left foot, could begin a second minor league
rehab stint next week. His first was cut short when he
re-aggravated the injury. ... Bobby Valentine won his 340th game as
Mets manager, passing Gil Hodges for second place. Davey Johnson is
first with 595 wins. ... Benny Agbayani tied his career high with
four hits in the first game and Matt Franco tied his career with
three hits in the opener.
Brewers-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Jeff D'Amico starts Sunday against Colorado and gets
a chance to build on his strong July numbers: 4-0 with a 0.45 ERA.
That's the lowest ERA in five starts during a month since Atlanta's
Greg Maddux had a 0.29 mark in September of 1995. ... The Brewers
play just four of their last 59 games on artificial turf: they have
a series in Cincinnati Sept. 14-17.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: Jason Schmidt, who has been on the DL since June 11
with inflammation in his right shoulder, was scheduled to pitch
three innings for the team's Rookie League team in Bradenton, Fla.
Schmidt is due to return to the Pirates in mid-August. ... OF
Adrian Brown continues to rehab his injured left hamstring. The

</P>
<P>

television. ''I was talking to my girlfriend and I said, 'Oh, my
gosh, I think I've been traded,''' Lee told an Arizona radio
station. ''I was watching SportsCenter and saw Curt Schilling with
my name down below.'' The official notification was a message left
on Lee's answering machine by a club official. Lee, who had the
first hit, first home run and first run in the history of the
Diamondbacks was playing for Triple-A Tucson when he was traded to
the Philadelphia Phillies, the team that had tried to sign him
originally. ... Schilling will make his first start Friday against
the Florida Marlins. With the acquisition of Schilling, the

<HEADLINE> Could the Concorde Crash Again?  </HEADLINE>
By GLENN McKENZIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Why did the supersonic jet catch fire? Why couldn't
the pilot extinguish the blaze by remote control? Did mechanics who
worked on the plane shortly before takeoff contribute to the
first-ever Concorde crash? Or was it a tire-burst that triggered
the blaze?
</P>
<P>
   Serious, unanswered questions faced French officials who pored
over data Thursday collected from the doomed needle-nosed luxury
jet's two black boxes to determine what caused the crash that
killed 113 people -- and prevent it from happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Experts were not ruling out human error by air traffic
controllers, mechanics and even the two pilots. Potential flaws in
the design or construction of the plane also were a concern. Some
speculated that a tire on the landing gear might have exploded,
with the debris being sucked into the engine's air duct.
</P>
<P>
   The last theory emerged after the French Transport Ministry's
Accident Inquiry Office published its first assessment of what went
so catastrophically wrong Tuesday afternoon at Paris' Charles de
Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   Its report made grim reading, describing a plane plagued by
problems from the moment it taxied down runway 26.
</P>
<P>
   The pride of French aviation left behind a trail of debris,
including tire parts on the runway, as one engine caught fire and
failed and another lost power.
</P>
<P>
   During takeoff, the control tower told Capt. Christian Marty
about the flames shooting out of the left side of the plane but he
was already going too fast to abort. Marty replied that he had
problems with engine No. 2, which is under the left wing, and that
he could not lift the landing gear.
</P>
<P>
   After takeoff, engine No. 1 malfunctioned, losing power. The
plane, now trailing long orange flames and thick black smoke in its
wake, banked left and dived into a small hotel near the town of
Gonesse. All 109 people on board and four on the ground were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say it is too early to ascertain exactly what
happened, and Air France, which owns the Concorde that was carrying
mainly German tourists on a charter flight to New York, declined to
comment Thursday on reasons behind the crash.
</P>
<P>
   The Transport Ministry's inquiry office said a preliminary
report would be published at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Former pilot and aviation expert Germain Chambost said the
possibility that a tire-burst contributed could not be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can surmise that a tire or several tires on the landing
gear exploded, that the debris from the tires got into the air duct
of one of the engines,'' he told France's LCI television.
</P>
<P>
   ''At full takeoff speed, it's clear that a motor like Concorde's
absorbs an enormous amount of air ... a tire that penetrates at
that moment in the engine could ... cause very serious damage,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   A big question rested on why the pilot was unable to put out the
blaze that started in engine No. 2 shortly before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Turcat, the first pilot ever to fly the Concorde when it
was still being developed by Britain and France in 1969, said the
extinguishers may have been cut off by the blaze, which raged at
hundreds of degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really incredible,'' Turcat said. ''We know there are
some bewildering and exceptional events that occurred (before and
during the crash) but we don't have explanations yet.''
</P>
<P>
   In seeking the cause of the blaze, some focused on the fact that
just before takeoff two mechanics replaced a thrust reverser on
engine No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Turcat questioned whether the mechanics left something that
could have obstructed the engine's turbine. ''In principle, the
(mechanics) are good. But the blades may have been blocked. We
don't know by what,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for France's National Airline Pilots Union, Erick
Derivry, said he was concerned about the prospect of faults that
could mean other Concordes are at risk. After the crash, France
took the exceptional step of suspending all Concorde flights.
British Airways, which owns several Concordes, briefly grounded
them but allowed them to resume flying shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   If ''specific risks'' in the Concorde were identified, Derivry
said, the pilots' union would support continuing the French flight
ban.
</P>
<P>
   Turcat expressed confidence that Air France would discover what
had caused the crash, which has threatened the very existence of
the Concorde, a potent symbol of French national pride.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is inconceivable that they won't (find answers). If they
don't, then it is all over (for the Concorde).''

<HEADLINE> Swift Probe of Concorde Crash Vowed  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL WOOLLS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A French prosecutor has promised a swift probe into
whether criminal charges should be brought in the Air France
Concorde crash that killed 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier Salvat, prosecutor for the Val d'Oise region where the
luxury supersonic jet went down in flames Tuesday, said Thursday
that he had taken the rare step of appointing three investigative
magistrates, rather than just one, because the investigation
promises to be complex.
</P>
<P>
   The magistrates, who can call witnesses and take testimony, are
roughly equivalent to district attorneys in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Salvat said the probe would decide who, if anyone, should be
charged with involuntary homicide and involuntary injury. The first
of the offenses is defined as a negligent killing and punishable
with up to three years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to act in such a way that the proceedings both
determine the cause of the accident quickly and provide information
for the families of the victims,'' Salvat said. He gave no
timeframe for completing the probe, but it could last months.
</P>
<P>
   Salvat declined to say what, if anything, his team had learned
since the investigation began Wednesday, a day after Air France
flight 4590 caught fire while taking off from Charles de Gaulle
Airport and crashed two minutes later into a small hotel in
Gonesse, a town just outside Paris. All 109 people aboard were
killed, as were four in the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-six of the New York-bound passengers were German tourists
who had planned to soar across the Atlantic at twice the speed of
sound, then board a ship for a leisurely Caribbean cruise.
</P>
<P>
   Attention has focused on engine No. 2, under the left wing, as
the probable source of the fire. Concordes have four Rolls-Royce
engines, two under each wing.
</P>
<P>
   The Transport Ministry disclosed late Thursday after decoding
the black box voice and data recorders that not only did that
engine fail, but engine No. 1 next to it lost some power during
takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   It said the plane could not even retract its landing gear and
left a trail of debris on the runway, including tire parts. This
raised speculation that a piece of tire may have been sucked into
an engine and triggered a fire.
</P>
<P>
   The National Union for Ground Engineers also said that a foreign
body could have gotten into the engines before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said it was too early to determine the exact cause
of the engine failure and fire on the left side of the plane.
</P>
<P>
   While experts sought to find the reason for the crash, others
were mourning its fatal effects.
</P>
<P>
   French and German officials and blue-uniformed airline crews
joined weeping relatives of crash victims for a
multi-denominational memorial service Thursday at Paris'
18th-century Madeleine church.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny white candles, each representing a lost life, lit the
altar, and a choir filled the church with Johann Sebastian Bach's
plaintive ''Passion.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Concorde is one of those works of human genius,'' said Pierre
d'Ornellas, Roman Catholic auxiliary bishop of Paris. ''But a
failure brought such a brutal disappearance of so many loved
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac, who did not attend the service, sent a
large bouquet of pale pink roses and other flowers. More modest
bouquets came from Parisians who wanted to show their sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Air France, which has promised to compensate victims' families,
said Thursday it would pay an advance of $20,000 each to help cover
funeral costs.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, which ended Concorde's 31-year record of safe
flying, provoked speculation about the jetliner's future.
</P>
<P>
   All Air France Concorde flights have been grounded since the
crash. British Airways resumed Concorde flights from London to New
York on Wednesday after initially suspending them after the crash.

<HEADLINE> Judge Refuses To Move Cuba Spy Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- A federal judge has refused to move the trial of
four accused Cuban spies out of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys had argued that extensive coverage by the
city's news media of Cuban-related stories -- including the Elian
Gonzalez saga -- would make it impossible to seat an impartial jury.
</P>
<P>
   The four are part of a group of 14 people accused of trying to
infiltrate U.S. military installations in Florida. Five others have
pleaded guilty and agreed to testify at the trial, which begins
Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The spy ring is said to be the largest Cuban espionage operation
uncovered in the United States in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The people named in Thursday's ruling includes alleged spymaster
Gerardo Hernandez, who is charged with murder conspiracy. He
allegedly supplied Cuba with information about two planes flown by
an exile group in 1996. Cuban fighter jets shot the planes down,
killing all four men aboard.

<HEADLINE> Gates Foundation Donates $40M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- A $40 million donation by the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation establishes a program to provide not just shelter
for homeless Washington families but support to keep them off the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ''Homelessness is a circumstance that inevitably pulls at your
heart,'' said Bill Gates Sr., co-chairman and CEO of the Gates
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The grant goes to the Healthy Families Program, which will work
with King, Pierce and Snohomish counties over the next five years
to provide transitional housing and support services for homeless
families.
</P>
<P>
   The program will provide 1,560 units for transitional housing --
the step between emergency shelters and affordable housing, said
Terry Meersman, project director of the Gates Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Support services will be a key part of Healthy Families, said
Gates, father of the Microsoft Corp. chairman. The program will
work with existing nonprofit housing and service organizations to
provide services for families such as job training and child care.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not about providing beds, it's about providing help for
people to get back into the mainstream,'' Mayor Paul Schell said
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Seeks To Mark Indian Site  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Indian leaders and historians are praising the
introduction of a bill by Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., to
make the Sand Creek Massacre killing field a national historic
site.
</P>
<P>
   Several national sites commemorate victories over Indians in the
conquest of the West, but none mark any of the half dozen massacres
that stained the record.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 Cheyennes and Arapahos, mostly women, children and
elderly, were killed in the dawn attack by 700 fighting men led by
Col. John M. Chivington, ''The Fighting Parson.'' Congress
condemned the Nov. 29, 1864, attack, but never paid promised
reparations.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 Cheyennes and a few Arapahos were camped at a site
picked by the U.S. Army. Historians say the attack on a peaceful
group of Indians triggered 12 years of war and resulted in the
defeat and death of Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer at the Little
Bighorn in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation finally recognizes a shameful event in our
country's history. It is based on scientific studies and makes it
clear America has the strength and resolve to face its past and
learn the painful lessons that come with intolerance,'' Campbell
said Thursday in a statement accompanying the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is a member of the Council of 44 Chiefs of the Northern
Cheyenne Tribe and some of his ancestors died at Sand Creek. His
bill proposes a 12,480-acre historic site 160 miles southeast of
Denver if all landowners are willing to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very much long overdue. There was a certain repression
that the United States would rather forget and pretend that it
never happened,'' said Steve Brady, president of the Northern
Cheyenne Descendants of Sand Creek.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a long wait,'' added Laird Cometsevah, president of
the Southern Cheyenne Descendants of Sand Creek.

   David Halaas, Colorado's state historian, said it was the first
time the U.S. government has set aside a place ''that was a site of

   A team of archaeologists and historians last spring was able to

<HEADLINE> 5,000 Years of Drinking in Exhibit  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a show for those who take drinking very
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of years ago, those in the Near East and Mediterranean
enjoyed dozens of types of beer and wine, and not just red, white
and rose. There were smoked wines and raisin wines, cooked wines
and wines flavored with salt, herbs or honey. And drink was stored,
transported and drunk from a myriad of containers.
</P>
<P>
   ''People really enjoyed it. They had fun,'' said Michal
Dayagi-Mendels, an expert in Israelite and Persian archaeology at
The Israel Museum in Jerusalem who curated ''Drink and Be Merry:
Wine and Beer in Ancient Times.'' The show is at The Jewish Museum
here from Sunday through Nov. 5.
</P>
<P>
   The trade of drink, curators say, had a role in virtually
everything.
</P>
<P>
   King Herod the Great, who built the ancient Jewish Temple, was a
famous imbiber who offered his guests fine wine imported from
Italy, Dayagi-Mendels said, gesturing toward huge pottery wine
vats.
</P>
<P>
   There are also wine jar fragments found in Herod's winter palace
in Masada.
</P>
<P>
   Another surprise is a section of scroll found in Qumran, home of
the Essene sect who many scholars believe produced the Dead Sea
Scrolls, a compendium of early Jewish thought and philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Essenes were understood to have been among the most
sober of ascetics, the scroll mentions their celebrating a
''Festival of the New Wine'' and is accompanied by a set of pottery
drinking bowls.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest object in the show is an Egyptian filter for sifting
the chaff from beer. It dates from the 10th to 9th century B.C.,
the curator said. There are also strainers and perforated straws.

Man Armed With Handgun Takes Pilots Hostage at JFK
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man armed with a handgun was apparently holding a pilot
and co-pilot hostage on board a National Airlines jet at John F. Kennedy
International Airport on Thursday night, a New York police spokesman said. There
were no passengers believed to have remained on the jet, and no injuries were
immediately reported. WNBC-TV reported that passengers had been let off the
plane, but that could not immediately be confirmed. Detective Edward Reuss said
the man, who was not immediately identified, ran from the terminal onto the
plane with some kind of handgun about 10 p.m.

NASA To Launch Lander To Mars
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A wheeled robot will be launched toward Mars in 2003 for
90 days of mobile exploration and will be bounced to the surface of the Red
Planet like a beach ball, NASA said Thursday. Edward Weiler, NASA's chief
scientist, announced the selection of the robot roving lander after considering
a competing proposal -- a Mars orbiter that was to take high resolution pictures
of that planet. Weiler also announced that the space agency is considering a
second Mars landing probe, also to be launched in 2003, but a decision on that
mission will not be made for a few weeks.

Experiments Suggest 'Fat Virus'
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   A cold-like virus may cause obesity, new experiments suggest. Researchers at
the University of Wisconsin in Madison have found that mice and chickens
infected with a common human virus put on much more fat than uninfected animals.
They have also discovered that the same virus is more prevalent among overweight
people, a strong indication that it may also cause obesity in humans. In four
experiments, the Wisconsin researchers inoculated chickens and mice with
adenovirus-36, a member of a viral family that includes about 50 strains.

Colombia Army Generals Accused of Allowing Massacre
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's attorney general on Thursday accused four
army generals and a colonel of allowing the massacre of 18 civilians by a
rightist paramilitary group. The announcement, the second this week implicating
senior officers in a massacre, follows the approval in Washington this month of
a $1.3 billion anti-narcotics aid package for Colombia despite concerns about
the army's ties to deadly paramilitary groups. The army angrily denounced the
investigations, saying they were sapping military morale.

IMF Approves $198 Million Loan for Kenya
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Recognizing progress by Kenya in battling corruption, the
International Monetary Fund on Thursday resumed help for the East African nation
by approving a $198 million loan. The move comes as Kenya is suffering its worst
economic crisis since independence from Britain in 1963, along with severe
drought and nationwide power and water shortages. Last month, President Daniel
arap Moi made a rare personal appeal for international help, saying 3 million of
Kenya's 22 million people were ''absolutely destitute.''

spending bill that Congress is sending President Clinton.he Senate passed the
bill on a 90-10 vote Thursday after Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Phil Gramm,
R-Texas, objected to $1.8 billion added to the package by a select group of

<HEADLINE> 1997 Nuke Inspection Said Deficient  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) -- Con Edison's last inspection of the Indian
Point 2 nuclear reactor was ''deficient in several respects'' that
may have contributed to a radioactive leak in February, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Con Edison did not recognize and take appropriate corrective
actions,'' the commission said Thursday, outlining the preliminary
results of its own inspection. ''This increased the likelihood that
detectable flaws ... were not identified.''
</P>
<P>
   When one of the 13,000 tubes leaked on Feb. 15, a minute amount
of radioactive steam was released. There were no injuries but it
was the worst accident in Indian Point history and the plant has
been shut down since.
</P>
<P>
   The utility told the NRC in May that it could not have detected
the corrosion that caused a crack to open in the tube carrying
radioactive water through a steam generator.
</P>
<P>
   However, the NRC said a 1997 utility inspection ''did not fully
assess the implications'' of water stress corrosion cracking.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed has asked permission to restart the plant this summer,
but the NRC has asked for more information and many residents and
officials are demanding that the plant's aging steam generators be
replaced first.

<HEADLINE> Suit Over Prison Conditions Settled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A lawsuit that put Philadelphia prisons
under the control of a federal judge because of overcrowding and
poor conditions has been settled after 18 years.
</P>
<P>
   David Richman, a lawyer representing inmates who sued over the
conditions, told U.S. District Judge Norma Shapiro they were
settling not because conditions were good but because a 1995
federal law to curb inmate lawsuits threatened to end the judge's
authority to force the city to implement reforms.
</P>
<P>
   However, city lawyer David Wolfsohn said conditions have
improved dramatically and the city is committed to completing its
work.
</P>
<P>
   ''If one compares today with 1982, it's like the difference
between night and day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's four prisons house 6,945 inmates, which is about 20
percent over the system's rated capacity. It is more than 600
inmates above the level prison officials once said would put the
system in crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement outlined Thursday, the city regains control
of the prisons. It will retain and fund the Philadelphia Board of
Prison Trustees, outside monitors and consultants hired during
Shapiro's oversight, for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Ten inmates in the courtroom seemed skeptical about city
officials' promise to maintain prison reforms once Shapiro's
oversight is gone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Somebody needs to force them to remember,'' said Edwin Rivera,
an inmate at the Detention Center. ''Everybody forgets about
inmates, but we are somebody's son, somebody's father, somebody's
husband or brother.''

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Fights Sinking Feeling  </HEADLINE>
By JOE McDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- The only thing keeping the Huangpu River
out of the Peace Hotel's Art Deco lobby on Shanghai's waterfront
this summer is a concrete flood wall.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the river has risen more than usual during the
rainy season. Instead, Shanghai is sinking.
</P>
<P>
   The land under the skyscrapers and 13 million people of this
bustling metropolis is deflating like a giant air mattress, slowly
settling as its shallow water table collapses after decades of
overuse.
</P>
<P>
   Sinking cities are common in chronically dry China, which is
guzzling water from underground aquifers to supply a booming
economy and growing population.
</P>
<P>
   Land under 46 cities is sinking, the government says. Areas
around Beijing, the capital, have sunk by up to 14 inches over the
past decade.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chinese officials warn publicly about relying too
heavily on wells, drought in recent years has complicated their
efforts. As rivers dry up, cities and farms drill more wells. More
than 100 cities in northern China are short of water, the official
Xinhua News Agency has reported. Some reservoirs are dry.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai has switched to river water for most uses, slowing its
annual descent to less than two-fifths of an inch. But after years
of rapid decline, even that threatens China's business capital,
which sprawls across flat land less than 10 feet above the Huangpu.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we didn't control this, the ground would collapse'' by
three feet every decade, said Liu Yi, a government geologist who
tracks the sinking. ''The damage would be unbelievable -- floods and
wrecked buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai, one of the world's most densely populated cities,
switched fairly easily to water from the Huangpu and Yangtze
rivers. But it still suffers the legacy of long, severe bouts of
ground subsidence.
</P>
<P>
   The problem stems from Shanghai's rapid 19th century
metamorphosis into a foreign colonial base. Shallow aquifers that
had supported a Chinese trading port were quickly strained
supplying factories and a populace that tripled by 1900 to more
than 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   The sinking was first noticed in 1921, but Shanghai went on
using ground water for decades, according to Liu, the senior
geologist for the Shanghai Institute of Geological Survey. The
problem got so bad by the 1950s and '60s that the ground was
sinking by four inches a year.
</P>
<P>
   The government took action in 1963, banning most wells and
limiting use of the rest. Still the decline continued, and Liu said
that since the mid-'60s the city has settled 16 more inches.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai has avoided nightmare scenarios of flooding in urban
neighborhoods or among the office towers of its sleek new financial
district. But official projections say water levels could rise 19
to 27 inches by 2050, threatening waterfront areas.
</P>
<P>
   Worst-hit is the old city center, where sections are at or below
the Huangpu's level. The district has some of Shanghai's most
valuable real estate and the Bund, the former British settlement
whose 1920s-era buildings make up the city's signature skyline.
</P>
<P>
   The Bund's name comes from Hindi -- a reminder of British
colonial rule in India -- and means embankment. The Huangpu then was
low enough that its flat bank was used as a mule path to tow junks
up the river.
</P>
<P>
   That bank is now topped by a flood wall built in the early 1990s
by city leaders worried that the summertime Huangpu would overflow
onto Sun Yat-sen Road, the eight-lane riverfront boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   They concealed the menace with Shanghainese flair, filling the
wall with shops and topping it with a tourist promenade. Families
stroll the wide walkway on summer evenings, unruffled that the
water on one side is higher than the ground on the other.
</P>
<P>
   Even before its mid-August peak, the Huangpu already is level
with the road, said Zhang Liugang, an official of the city
Anti-Flood Office. In 1997, he said, the rain-gorged river ran five
feet higher than the road and came within 3&AMP;frac12; feet of the top of the
flood wall.
</P>
<P>
   The geologist Liu has spent 12 years tracking the city's
decline. His staff of 100 and network of 27 monitoring stations
with sensors drilled 300 to 600 feet into the earth monitor the
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't see it if you look around, but the problem is
terrible. We can't wait until it's visible,'' Liu said.
</P>
<P>
   In a tactic that borders on science fiction, Shanghai is trying
to reverse the decline by recharging its aquifers, pumping in 5.2
billion gallons of water a year.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Liu said, has met with modest success, with land in
some areas rising as much as 4&AMP;frac12; inches.

<HEADLINE> Deadly Bacteria Linked to Restaurant  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW TILGHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) --The number of confirmed cases of food poisoning
stemming from a restaurant rose to 13, health officials said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   City Health Commissioner Seth Foldy said officials were still
investigating the exact source of the E. coli bacteria and how it
got into the Sizzler Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 people who had confirmed cases of bacteria, six had
symptoms that suggested serious intestinal infection, Foldy said.
</P>
<P>
   Sizzler USA's chief executive officer, Thomas Metzger, traveled
to Milwaukee Thursday. He visited some of the ill, met with health
officials and the local franchise owner, company spokeswoman Marina
Ein said.
</P>
<P>
   ''My personal prayers and the prayers of all Sizzler associates
are with the people of Milwaukee who have been touched by this
tragedy,'' Metzger said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   So far, food items tested at the restaurant did not contain E.
coli. The restaurant has been closed temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Foldy's department said Wednesday it had at least 20 confirmed
cases of E. coli infection in Milwaukee County this month, but not
all involved Sizzler.
</P>
<P>
   The bacteria strain believed to be the cause of the illnesses
often spreads through eating undercooked contaminated meat and
typically causes bloody diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant chain Wednesday released a statement that said
the owners of the franchise store were working closely with health
officials to determine the cause of the food poisoning.

<HEADLINE> Will There Be a Convention 'Bounce'  </HEADLINE>
By WILL LESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Political conventions usually provide a
surge in the polls, called ''a bounce,'' that comes as voters tune
into the weeklong political gatherings. Sometimes, it begins before
the convention, recedes in the weeks afterward or is matched by the
opposing party's event.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally it can change the dynamics of a presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   ''That kind of unadulterated attention on one party or candidate
almost inevitably results in an increase in that party's standing
in the polls,'' said Frank Newport, executive editor of the Gallup
Poll.
</P>
<P>
   But with fewer people expected to pay close attention to this
year's Republican and Democratic conventions, analysts say the
result could be a shorter bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're sort of in uncharted territory this year because these
have the potential to be the conventions that nobody watches,''
said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. ''The bounce may be a lot
less noticeable.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the Republican National Convention that begins here
Monday, George W. Bush and running mate Dick Cheney opened an
11-point lead over Democratic rival Al Gore in a new CNN-USA
Today-Gallup poll of likely voters, 50 percent to 39 percent in a
four-way race. The same poll had had them tied a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   But low interest in the convention may affect future surges.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of those surveyed, 34 percent, expressed interest
in following the Republican convention, compared with 44 percent
interested in the 1996 GOP gathering and 53 percent interested in
the 1992 Democratic convention, according to another poll Thursday
by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no drama at the conventions this year,'' Garin said.
''It's not like voters will be on the edge of their seats.''
</P>
<P>
   In some past elections, the convention bounce has influenced the
presidential horse race, even if the numbers tightened again by
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1976, Jimmy Carter surged to a 62-29 lead over President
Ford after the Democratic convention and the Republican Ford was
unable to close the gap after his party's event. Carter won the
election, 50 percent to 48 percent.
</P>
<P>
   -- Four years later, Ronald Reagan moved ahead, 45 percent to 29
percent, after the Republican convention, but Carter closed the
race to even after the Democratic event.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1988, Democrat Michael Dukakis surged ahead by 17 points
after the Democratic convention and George Bush moved back into a
slight lead after the GOP event, which followed the Democrats that
year. Bush led for the rest of the campaign, winning election by 7
points.
</P>
<P>
   -- In 1992, Bush held an 8-point lead before the Democratic
convention, after which Bill Clinton surged ahead 56 percent to 34
percent. Bush narrowed the gap to 10 points after the Republican
convention, but never caught up. Reform Party candidate Ross Perot
had withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's often a new equilibrium in the race after the two
conventions, but usually not far from where the polls were before
the first convention,'' said Robert Erikson, a Columbia University
political scientist. ''Bounce doesn't matter near as much as you
think it does when you see it bouncing.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats meet Aug. 14-17 in Los Angeles and will have the
advantage of seeing how Republicans handled their convention and
being able to maneuver to outperform them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like a baseball game, the home team gets to bat last,''
said GOP pollster Neil Newhouse, referring to the party in power
holding its convention last. ''You have the advance knowledge of
what they did and more pressure to match it and beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for the People
and the Press, compared polling immediately after a political
convention to taking one's blood pressure after running.
</P>
<P>
   ''Conventions have an impact if they redefine the candidate,''
he said. ''But if the convention is not much of an event, the polls
go up and down. That's why they're called bounces.''

<HEADLINE> House Votes To Rescind Tax Increase  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans headed to their presidential
convention with another tax cut in their pocket -- the repeal of a
1993 measure that has meant higher taxes for millions of Social
Security recipients.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, passed 265-159 Thursday with the help of 52
Democrats, was the last major bill the House finished before
Congress adjourned for the summer and the two national presidential
nominating conventions. Republicans meet in Philadelphia next week;
Democrats convene next month in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Social Security tax break came on the heels of a series of
GOP-led initiatives to cut inheritance taxes, taxes on some married
couples, a phone tax and taxes affecting health care and business.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, as he has with the inheritance and marriage
tax bills, said Thursday he would veto the Social Security measure
because it undermines fiscal discipline and takes away resources
needed for education and other priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have passed reckless tax cut after reckless tax cut after
reckless tax cut, to drain away our hard-earned surplus and put us
back in the red,'' he said in remarks in the Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's bill rescinds a tax increase that was part of a major
deficit-reduction package the White House put together in 1993 --
without a single Republican vote in favor -- to make a dent in what
was then a budget deficit heading toward $300 billion. Vice
President Al Gore, in his role as president of the Senate, cast the
tie-breaking vote for that package, and Republicans were quick to
label the Social Security provision the ''Gore Social Security
Tax.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Unlike Mr. Gore, we don't think it's right for seniors who
earn more than $34,000 per year to pay taxes on up to 85 percent of
their Social Security benefits,'' said House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The tax was first imposed during the Reagan administration and
in 1993 was increased from being applicable to 50 percent of
benefits to 85 percent for individuals with incomes of more than
$34,000 and couples with incomes of $44,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill would return it to the 50 percent level, at
a cost of more than $100 billion over 10 years. Revenues from the
tax go to the Medicare trust fund and losses from the tax break
would come from the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The increased tax now affects some 9 million seniors and the
number is expected to go up sharply in the future with the rise of
seniors with larger incomes.
</P>
<P>
   A Democratic substitute, defeated 256-169, would have raised the
threshold for the 85 percent of benefit tax to $80,000 for
individuals and $100,000 for families.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said their bill would cost $40 billion less over 10
years and, unlike the GOP bill, would be effective only as long as
the budget surplus is sufficient to cover losses to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., sponsor of
companion Social Security tax legislation, said he had urged the
Finance Committee to include his bill in tax relief legislation
that Congress will consider this fall.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans on Thursday also dressed staffers up as a
bride and groom and put them in a car decked out with streamers and
tin cans to deliver the marriage penalty tax bill to the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would reduce income tax for millions of married
couples, including 25 million who pay higher rates than they would
if they were single, but the Clinton administration says the cost --
$292 billion over 10 years -- is too high and the measure is overly
generous to richer Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Clinton vetoed a $792 billion GOP tax cut package.
This year, Republicans, changing strategy, have offered their tax
bills in piecemeal fashion. But Democrats said that added together
they still total some $733 billion over a decade, close to last
year's level, and that they consume far too much of future budget
surpluses that are needed for education and health programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Passage of all these tax cuts together will take us right back
to the deficit spending and the red ink we had in those years'' of
the 1980s and early 1990s, House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt of
Missouri said.
</P>
<P>
   But House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer,
R-Texas, said that with the budget now solidly in surplus it was
not right to tax the benefits of senior citizens. ''Social Security
checks should not arrive in the mailbox with a bill from the IRS
attached,'' he said. ''It's unfair, it's unnecessary and it harms
the retirement security of millions of Americans now and in the
years to come.''

<HEADLINE> Corona expands into canned sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PERINTON, N.Y. (AP) - Canandaigua Brands Inc., distributor of
Corona beer in the 25 states west of the Mississippi River,
announced that Corona Extra will be sold in cans beginning next
month.
</P>
<P>
   Corona in a can, as the company calls it, was designed for
convenience because venues such as concert halls, airlines and
country clubs often don't allow bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The cans are a good thing because it provides access to other
venues,'' said Mark Swartzberg, analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in
New York City. ''It's a logical next step for the development of a
strong brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Corona is currently the most important source of profits and
growth for the company, accounting for about 25 percent of
Canandaigua Brands' portfolio, Swartzberg said, adding Corona
should continue its double-digit growth in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''Corona in a can has been kicked around in the past but never
gotten through,'' said Mark Maring, vice president of investor
relations at Canandaigua Brands Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Canandaigua Brands Inc., based in the Monroe County town of
Perinton, distributes rights to Corona in 25 western states. The
Gambrinus Co. in San Antonio, Texas, distributes Corona in eastern
markets, including Rochester.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Takes Pilots Hostage at JFK  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A man with a handgun walked onto a National
Airlines jet full of passengers late Thursday night and took the
pilot and co-pilot hostage at John F. Kennedy International
Airport, authorities and witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Both were later released and police were negotiating with the
gunman who remained inside the plane early Friday. The gunman had
issued a list of demands, including asking to speak with someone
from the Argentine Consulate, according to New York Police Chief
Thomas Fahey.
</P>
<P>
   An officer at the Argentine Consulate confirmed that a police
detective had called seeking to contact Ambassador Guillermo
McGough and that the message had been passed on, but no further
details were available.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman entered the airplane about 10 p.m. as passengers were
boarding for a flight to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigative sources said the suspect had somehow
bypassed the airport's metal detectors, then drew his weapon when
he was challenged and walked to the gate onto the plane.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the gunman told a flight attendant to shut the
door to the jet, but dozens of passengers rushed toward the exit
and ran from the plane. The man, holding a gun to the pilot's head,
did nothing to stop the exodus.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said the gunman at some point ordered the pilot to
clear the plane of all remaining passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Port Authority Police Chief William Cafaro said all 143
passengers and 7 crew members had escaped or been let off the
Boeing 757 by 1 a.m., about 2&AMP;frac12; hours after the incident began,
leaving only the gunman aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Schlesinger, a passenger, saw the commotion as a police
officer aimed his own weapon at the cockpit door.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what was going on until I saw that SWAT team
member with a shotgun. Then I knew it was serious,'' Schlesinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reuss said the man, who was not immediately identified, was
outside the terminal gate just as Flight 19 to Las Vegas was to
depart.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said the flight had been delayed by fog about an hour
but was ready to take off when the man flashed a silver-plated gun
at airline workers, walked down the jet way, onto the plane and
into the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Clark, one of those who escaped, told The Associated Press
he figured out what was happening when he heard someone say a man
had a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard this bustle and commotion behind me at the door and I
heard a man's voice saying, 'Just secure the door. Secure the door
now.''' Clark said. ''Then he walked right through first class at a
high rate of speed toward the cockpit. People in the aisle across
from me they said, 'He's got a gun,' that's when all hell broke
loose and basically they beat feet and I beat feet.''
</P>
<P>
   A National Airlines spokeswoman said early Friday that the
airline had no immediate comment.
</P>
<P>
   National Airlines, which began service in May 1999, provides
daily nonstop flights between Las Vegas and major metropolitan
areas in the United States, including New York, Chicago, Los
Angeles and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The company's investors include Rio Hotel &AMP; Casino Inc. and
Harrah's Entertainment Inc., which are based in Las Vegas. It also
has a ticketing and baggage agreement with Virgin Atlantic Airways
flights into Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 7, 1969, Felix Peterson-Coplin hijacked a New
York-to-Puerto Rico Eastern Airlines flight, forcing the pilots to
fly to Havana, Cuba. The plane was well into its flight when he
showed a handgun to a flight attendant and asked to be led to the
cockpit. No one was injured and Peterson-Coplin was eventually
sentenced to 6&AMP;frac12; years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Federal Aviation Administration began requiring
better background information on employees with access to
restricted areas of airports, including employment history for the
past decade and a criminal background check.

<HEADLINE> Study Suggests Pain Changes Body  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Doctors long have been uncertain just how much
pain premature infants feel during medical therapy. A new study in
rats suggests that the effects of that pain may last a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   In a study appearing Friday in the journal Science, researchers
at the National Institutes of Health found that painful trauma,
like that caused by medical procedures on premature infants, caused
newborn rats to become much more sensitive to pain as they grew
older.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said NIH researcher M.A. Ruda, is that pain causes
the developing nervous system of the very young to grow more of the
nerve cells that carry the sensation of pain to the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found that there are more nerve endings that fire and
transmit the information,'' said Ruda, first author of the study.
''These animals later were more sensitive and had a greater
response to pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruda said the study only suggests what may happen in premature
infants.
</P>
<P>
   Medical science is in the midst of an intense effort to
understand how the nervous system develops and how the growth of
nerve tissue is affected by stimulation such as pain. The research
has a direct bearing on efforts to save and improve the lives of
infants born prematurely, before the normal 40-week gestation.
</P>
<P>
   Survival of babies born up to 15 weeks premature is now not
unusual, but it requires a major medical effort and many painful
procedures, including countless needle sticks, breathing tubes and
even surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Patricia A. McGrath, a pain researcher and professor of
pediatrics at the University of Western Ontario, said that 10 years
ago ''there was a real belief that the pain system in premature
babies was not developed and these infants would really not feel as
much pain.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, McGrath said, doctors worried that premature
infants given powerful anesthetics ''would not be able to clear the
drug as well as older infants.'' The choice sometimes was between
skipping anesthesia during lifesaving surgery or no therapy. Most
doctors chose life and hoped that the pain caused no lasting
effect.
</P>
<P>
   But Ruda said that the study in rats suggests there is a lasting
effect.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, Ruda and her colleagues injected an irritant that
causes pain into the left rear paw of day-old rats. Lab rats at
that age are in the same development stage as human babies born at
25 weeks of gestation.
</P>
<P>
   The paws were sore for several days and then healed.
</P>
<P>
   Later, when the rats were grown, the researchers tested their
perception of pain by seeing how fast the animals would withdraw
from a hot surface. Their reaction time was compared with that of
control rats that had not been treated.
</P>
<P>
   Ruda said the treated rats reacted to the heat about twice as
fast as the control rats.
</P>
<P>
   When the heat test was administered on the right, or untreated
paw, of the test rats, they reacted just as did the control rats.
This suggested that the pain early in life had made the treated paw
permanently more sensitive to pain.
</P>
<P>
   Microscopic examination of nerves in the animals showed why,
Ruda said.
</P>
<P>
   In the treated paw of the rats, there were more nerve circuits
to carry pain stimuli to the brain, said Ruda.
</P>
<P>
   Ruda said other studies have shown that premature babies tend to
report more pain in their childhood years and their parents report
that these children's pain response is greater than that of their
siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jonelle C. Rowe, an NIH doctor who specializes in treating
premature babies, said there may have been some babies in the past
who had surgery without anesthesia, as Ruda claims, but that it was
rare.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori's Embarks on Third Term  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori has defied raucous
protests at home and growing isolation abroad in heading toward his
inauguration Friday, embarking on an unprecedented third term after
a tainted re-election victory.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 Fujimori opponents staged one of the biggest
protests of his decade in power, a downtown rally that was to
culminate with a march on Congress in a bid to spoil the inaugural
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Workers, students, and Peruvians from other backgrounds united
Thursday evening to open the street demonstrations with a raucous,
torch-lit rally as drums pounded loudly in the night air.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democracy, yes! Dictatorship, no!'' the demonstrators chanted
on a large plaza fronting the Palace of Justice, lofting a huge red
banner emblazoned with the word ''DEMOCRACIA.''
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, who forced Fujimori into a second round and
then boycotted the May 28 final ballot after crying fraud, vowed to
discredit Friday's inauguration by marching tens of thousands of
people in an outpouring of ''peaceful resistance.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We come here to say: 'No to the dictatorship!'' the opposition
leader said in a fiery speech like those he used to galvanize
voters and leap from obscurity during the campaign. ''We are going
to rescue liberty and democracy from the clutches of the
dictator.''
</P>
<P>
   Riot police stayed away from the marathon rally.
</P>
<P>
   During his one-hour speech, Toledo declared, ''Mr. Fujimori:
Peruvians who love their country will not allow you to remain five
more years in power!''
</P>
<P>
   He said Peruvians had mobilized from across the country and
praised them for joining the protest dubbed the ''March of the Four
Suyos'' -- an allusion to the four corners of the ancient Incan
empire.
</P>
<P>
   ''This march will not end until the dictatorship falls!'' he
vowed.
</P>
<P>
   For days, demonstrators had seeped into Lima aboard trucks and
buses from the countryside, sleeping in open-air tent camps and
eating from communal stewpots. Toledo organizers had vowed to put
at least 200,000 people into the streets, which would be the
largest in more than two decades. But by late Thursday, he mustered
barely a fraction of that.
</P>
<P>
   A Stanford-educated economist, Toledo, 54, said democracy meant
meeting unrequited demands for social and economic change in this
South American country of 26 million -- creating jobs and helping
the poor.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowd, one toddler held up a crudely penciled portrait of
Fujimori attached to the body of a rat. Other people carried
flaming torches, the rainbow-colored flag of the Inca empire, even
a makeshift black coffin meant to symbolize democracy's demise.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody here voted for Mr. Fujimori. His was a fraudulent
victory and we demand a new vote,'' said demonstrator Rosario
Sanchez.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, whose autocratic style is seen by critics as a
throwback to the Latin American dictatorships of old, has ordered
as many as 40,000 police on alert, tear gas launchers at the ready.
While he said the rights of all citizens would be respected,
Fujimori warned he would not permit ''outbreaks against public
order.''
</P>
<P>
   International monitors have said the May 28 election did not
meet minimum standards of fairness, and they refused to lend it
legitimacy by overseeing it.
</P>
<P>
   In what critics here interpreted as a snub to Fujimori, only two
Latin American presidents accepted invitations to Friday's
swearing-in, compared to nine at his second inaugural in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo charged that Fujimori, a bespectacled former university
rector first elected in 1990, has carried this South American
country into a personal dictatorship with another five-year term.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested the pro-democracy movement was unstoppable.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not one step back! The struggle will continue!'' many chanted.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori had wide popular support in 1992 when he suspended the
constitution and shuttered Congress, saying strong action was
necessary to carry out free-market economic reforms and defeat the
bloody Maoist Shining Path insurgency. Three years later, he was
re-elected by a landslide.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, Fujimori's popularity has sagged, as
his economic policies failed to provide jobs and the fading threat
of leftist rebels ceased to justify his disregard for democratic
checks and balances.
</P>
<P>
   Many said they were fed up.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Humphrey was among thousands of women dressed in black
to mourn Peru's ''murdered democracy.'' Beckoning to protesters all
about her, she said, ''If Fujimori wants to know what democracy is,
this is democracy!''

<HEADLINE> Violence, Crime Threaten Venezuela  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- When prospective passengers flag down
his taxi, 62-year old Esteban Sanchez peers through his thick
glasses, notes their age, clothing and posture -- and often decides
not to stop.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year in Caracas, 32 taxi and bus drivers have been
murdered, according to the city's main drivers association.
Sanchez's friend and co-worker, Nicasio Reyes, was recently shot to
death on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course I'm afraid,'' Sanchez said, ''but I need to work to
survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by rising unemployment, a hard-to-implement new judicial
code and an under-equipped police force, crime is surging in
Venezuela. The murder rate is up 70 percent this year, police say.
Frustrated citizens are taking justice into their own hands.
Lynchings are on the rise, as are killings by police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that people's most pressing concern is their personal
safety. And candidates in Sunday's nationwide elections are
responding with tough-crime rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Pena, a candidate for mayor of Caracas, has devoted most
of his campaign to crime, traveling to New York and Philadelphia to
discuss tactics with police chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   President Hugo Chavez's chief rival in his bid for re-election,
Francisco Arias, has won support from the middle and upper classes
with promises to control violence.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez took office 17 months ago promising a ''social
revolution'' for Venezuela. But despite a surge in the
international price of oil, Venezuela's main export, the economy
has taken a nosedive.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is estimated at 15 percent to 20 percent. More than
half of Venezuela's 23 million people live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Police say they need more government funding -- for new officers,
higher salaries and more advanced equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Caracas police officer Victor Rodriguez, a 20-year veteran of
the force, said he makes $450 a month and often works 24-hour
shifts because his station is understaffed.
</P>
<P>
   Low police morale has caused widespread corruption, activists
say.
</P>
<P>
   Alvaro Gutierrez, president of the watchdog group Lights Against
Crime, said victims frequently decide not to report incidents to
the police.
</P>
<P>
   ''If your house is broken into, and you call the authorities,
they're going to inspect the site, see the weak points, and
possibly come back the next week to break in themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated residents are responding to crime by shooting thieves
dead or by publicly lynching them.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a crowd tossed a suspected mugger off a 25-foot
bridge in Caracas -- breaking his ribs, legs, and arms. Enraged
community members killed a thief in an eastern Caracas suburb the
same week.
</P>
<P>
   But criminologists point out that police are resorting to
vigilantism as well. Officers have killed more than 500 people so
far this year, the newspaper El Nacional reported this month.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians, including Chavez, seek the reform of a legal
code instituted last July that was designed to eliminate secret
trials and seemingly endless exchanges of written arguments.
</P>
<P>
   The new system reflects the U.S. judicial system, with public
trials, citizen juries and the presumption of innocence. Police
must notify a prosecutor within 24 hours after arresting a subject,
and courts must decide within 48 hours whether suspects can remain
in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Police complain that under the new code they cannot arrest known
criminals unless they catch them red-handed. They also criticize
new benefits offered to minors and to those who admit their guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the Caracas police officer, said he has arrested the
same youth five times.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the criminals) laugh at us now,'' he said. ''They know
we're hampered by the laws.''

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Responds to Clinton Request  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- The prosecutor seeking to disbar
President Clinton said she would agree to a 30-day delay in
proceedings on the condition that a trial would be complete before
the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Clinton face an Aug. 1 deadline to respond to a
lawsuit seeking to disbar him over misleading testimony he gave in
the Paula Jones sexual harassment case.
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers asked Tuesday for an additional month to
respond, arguing that Clinton's presidential duties have not left
him enough time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed Thursday, prosecutor Marie-Bernarde Miller
said she normally would accommodate such a request without
conditions. But she noted that appointed Circuit Judge Leon Johnson
is to leave office at the end of the year and said it would be in
the best interest of all parties to complete the trial before then.
</P>
<P>
   The Arkansas Supreme Court Committee on Professional Conduct
wants a judge to rule the president is unfit to be a lawyer because
of his testimony in the Jones case about his relationship with
former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 6, Angels 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Herbert Perry and Chris Singleton hit
two-run homers as the Chicago White Sox beat the Anaheim Angels 6-5
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee tied a career-best with his third four-hit game of
the season and Brook Fordyce had three hits for the White Sox. The
AL Central leaders, who had lost five of six, finished with 18
hits.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Garland (2-2) survived a shaky fifth inning by his middle
infielders to get his first career victory against an AL team. The
right-hander, who at age 20 years, 10 months, is the youngest
pitcher in the majors, allowed four runs and five hits in six
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the runs off Garland were unearned, the result of
shortstop Jose Valentin's fielding error during Anaheim's four-run
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke got three outs for his 19th save in 22 tries. He
gave up a run on Adam Kennedy's triple and Darin Erstad's sacrifice
fly.
</P>
<P>
   Perry homered for the third consecutive game, hitting his ninth
of the season in the second after Lee's single. Fordyce followed
with a single, advanced on a groundout and scored on a single by
Valentin that gave Chicago a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth, Fordyce recorded his second triple in 704 major
league at-bats with a one-out drive near the top of the 18-foot
high wall in right-center. Fordyce scored on a passed ball by
rookie catcher Bengie Molina.
</P>
<P>
   Television replays clearly showed that a fan leaned over and
touched Fordyce's drive. Right fielder Tim Salmon and Angels
manager Mike Scioscia unsuccessfully argued for the play to be
ruled a double.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas led off the fifth with a bloop single and scored on
Singleton's eighth homer, which extended Chicago's margin to 6-0.
It was Singleton's fourth hit in five career at-bats against Brian
Cooper (4-5), and his second home run.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, who failed to get a runner past second base in the
first four innings, trimmed Chicago's lead to 6-4 in the fifth
after loading the bases with no one out on two walks and a scratch
single by Kennedy off the glove of second baseman Ray Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin was in a perfect position to start a double play after
fielding Orlando Palmeiro's routine grounder, but fumbled the ball
and tossed too late to Durham for the force on Kennedy as Troy
Glaus scored.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, the major league hit leader, then lined a two-run single
under Garland's glove, and Palmeiro scored when Valentin dropped
the ball in his haste to turn what should have been an
inning-ending double play on Mo Vaughn's grounder to Durham.

Notes: The White Sox have won the opening game in 15 of their last
17 series. ... Erstad, 0-for-5 on Wednesday night at Texas, has
gone hitless in consecutive games only once -- on May 5-6 at
Seattle. ... Vaughn came up in the seventh with the tying runs on
base, but struck out against left-hander Kelly Wunsch. ...
Singleton's homer was the sixth Cooper surrendered in a span of 18
1-3 innings, after not allowing one in 28 1-3 innings over his
previous four starts. ... Molina, one of the Angels' most pleasant
surprises this season both offensively and defensively, experienced
his worst defensive game of the season with his third passed ball
of the year and two errors -- one on a catcher's interference call
that allowed Singleton to reach base in the third. Molina had only
three errors in his previous 77 starts behind the plate this
season.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 5, Athletics 4, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Troy O'Leary hit an RBI single in the
10th inning to give the Boston Red Sox a 5-4 victory over the
Oakland Athletics on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before the game, Boston acquired infielder Mike
Lansing and pitchers Rolando Arrojo and Rich Croushore from
Colorado in a seven-player trade that sent infielder Jeff Frye to
the Rockies with pitchers Brian Rose, John Wasdin and Jeff
Taglienti.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the trade and Carl Everett's suspension for bumping
an umpire on July 15, the Red Sox had just 23 players available for
the game. They had only one position player late in the game,
outfielder Trot Nixon, who came in to play left in the 10th inning.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's RBI single came off Jeff Tam (3-3).
</P>
<P>
   Rich Garces (5-0) relieved in the eighth and Derek Lowe pitched
the 10th for his 22nd save in 27 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox tied it in the ninth when Bernard Gilkey singled and
Jason Varitek doubled off Jason Isringhausen.
</P>
<P>
   It was Isringhausen's fifth blown save in 28 opportunities. He
has three saves, two blown saves and a loss in his last six
outings.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada had put the A's up 4-3 in the seventh inning with
his 19th homer of the season, and 53rd overall for the A's. It's
the most in a career for an Oakland shortstop, one more than Bert
Campaneris hit from 1968-76.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Hernandez homered for the second straight game, a two-run
drive in the A's second. Hernandez raised his season total to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Olmedo Saenz added a solo shot in the third, but Boston tied it
3-all on Gilkey's two-run triple in the fourth and Nomar
Garciaparra's homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   A's starter Barry Zito, who got his first major league victory
Saturday against Anaheim, went seven innings, allowing three runs
on four hits and striking out five.
</P>
<P>
   Boston starter Tim Wakefield, 4-0 since losing to the Blue Jays,
allowed all four runs and seven hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Red Sox plan to start Arrojo on Sunday against
Oakland's Gil Heredia, and to move Ramon Martinez's next start to
Monday. ... A's rookie pitcher Mark Mulder is to face the Pedro
Martinez on Friday. A's manager Art Howe isn't nervous about
putting the rookie up against the formidable All-Star. ''Anyone can
beat anyone on any given day,'' Howe said. ''I'm not worried.''

<HEADLINE> Opposition Face Yugoslavia Election  </HEADLINE>
By DUSAN STOJANOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic's decision to
call presidential elections for September shifts attention to the
fragmented opposition, which must now unite to challenge the
Yugoslav president's authoritarian rule.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders say Milosevic wants the elections to renew
his mandate before the country's economic problems get any worse.
Victory also would improve his chances of avoiding extradition to
the international court in The Hague, which indicted him for war
crimes in Kosovo last year.
</P>
<P>
   But some opposition leaders say the election could spark the
final breakup of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro, a small pro-Western republic that along with larger
Serbia forms the Yugoslav federation, responded to Thursday's
announcement of elections Sept. 24 by refusing to take part in the
balloting, in which voters also will select parliament members and
local officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montenegro will undoubtedly not participate in this farce,''
the republic's deputy parliament speaker, Predrag Popovic, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   However, Montenegro's 600,000 people are deeply split between
pro- and anti-Milosevic factions, and it was unclear whether all
Montenegrins would stay away from the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The odds of victory in September are in Milosevic's favor.
Yugoslavia's new voting law -- changed by his government this month
-- requires only a simple majority for victory without regard for
the turnout. International observers have reported vote rigging and
tampering during previous elections, organized and won by Milosevic
since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''Serbia's united opposition faces the toughest election
campaign in history and not only because of the total media
blackout and the deep dissatisfaction of the masses,'' said one
opposition party, the Democratic Alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are in a situation unparalleled even in the most primitive
societies and the regime will resort to the business of rigging the
process ahead of time,'' the party added.
</P>
<P>
   Another opposition leader, Zoran Djindjic, said his followers
would contest the election in hopes of ending Milosevic's rule,
which has led to the disintegration of the country and its
isolation after ethnic wars of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are optimistic,'' Djindjic said. ''In the next five days,
the democratic opposition will forge an agreement on a joint
electoral appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   But the largest opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement
of Vuk Draskovic, announced it will boycott the vote. Even if it
did participate, the party said, it would run its own candidates
rather than support a joint-opposition ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia's opposition movement has been criticized by both Western
officials and supporters in Serbia for its inability to join forces
in the struggle against Milosevic, whom many consider a threat to
the stability of southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show Milosevic's popularity has dwindled since
last year's NATO bombing of the country, which forced Yugoslav
troops out of the southern Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has systematically cracked down on opposition media
and outmaneuvered the opposition. With his strong hold on media and
his support among the police and Yugoslav army, Milosevic is
considered a formidable opponent despite his international
isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's allies pushed through a constitutional amendment on
July 6, enabling him to seek a second term as Yugoslavia's head of
state.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the parliament approved legislation giving Milosevic
the option to run for two more four-year terms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to direct presidential elections, voters will select
federal parliament deputies, who had been chosen by separate
assemblies in Montenegro and Serbia.

<HEADLINE> GOP Reworking Its Platform Tone  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Playing up a ''progressive'' side,
Republicans are adopting a more conciliatory tone toward government
while hewing closely in substance to their conservative
fundamentals on taxes, abortion, defense and more.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP's platform committee begins work Friday on a draft that
drops the party's call for making English the official language and
proposes a stronger federal role in education and the environment
than Republican policy has favored.
</P>
<P>
   ''Government does have a role to play, but as a partner, not a
rival, to the armies of compassion,'' states the draft.
</P>
<P>
   A document of the party, not the presidential candidate, it is
infused nonetheless with the optimistic bearing of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the draft leaves unchanged the party's
uncompromising stand against abortion rights. It also maintains the
position that homosexuality is incompatible with military service.
</P>
<P>
   Platform committee members received the draft late Thursday and
are expected to make mostly cosmetic changes. The full Republican
National Convention, opening Monday, will ratify the document next
week.
</P>
<P>
   While the 1996 GOP platform was packed with biting, sometimes
dour attacks on President Clinton, the new tome mentions Clinton
and Democratic candidate Al Gore once or twice in passing.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to be uplifting,'' Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson,
chairman of the platform committee, said Thursday on CNN. ''We want
to be visionary and progressive.''
</P>
<P>
   Gone, too, is the zeal to close half a dozen federal departments
-- the draft does not propose shutting any -- and a portrayal of the
federal government as not just intrusive, but practically
villainous.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the draft sits upon the conservative foundation that
less government is best.
</P>
<P>
   ''In recent years, America seemed to move away from some of the
qualities that make her great, but we are now relearning some
important lessons,'' it says.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're coming to understand that a good and civil society
cannot be packaged into government programs but must originate in
our homes, in our neighborhoods, and in the private institutions
that bring us together.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft gives no ground to abortion-rights advocates,
asserting as before that ''the unborn child has a right to life
which cannot be infringed,'' and proposing to ban abortion through
a constitutional amendment and legislation.
</P>
<P>
   That topic is a likely flashpoint for debate in two days of
platform meetings. Bush believes abortion should remain legal in
cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the woman -- exceptions
not specified in the platform -- but he chose not to challenge the
party's social conservatives on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise the draft is compatible with his policies on deep tax
cuts, partial privatization of Social Security and other major
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said he thinks Bush ''is going to feel very comfortable
with the platform. I don't think anybody can embrace it in total.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft does not propose dramatic departures in a GOP
environmental policy that favors cooperation with private interests
and an emphasis on state regulation over mandates from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But it scales back criticism of the Endangered Species Act,
celebrates advances in wetlands restoration and air and water
quality, and asserts, ''There should be a strong federal role in
environmental protection.''
</P>
<P>
   In a section billed in advance by platform leaders as an example
of the ''compassionate conservatism'' promoted by Bush, the
document supports large increases in spending on behalf of women's
health, in particular, and medical research in general.
</P>
<P>
   Such research is ''one of the few areas in which government
investment yields tangible results,'' the draft says.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, ''we will promote a health care system that
supports, not supplants, the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   On immigration, the draft drops language from the 1996 platform
that sought to forbid giving social services to illegal immigrants
and said even legal immigrants should not depend on taxpayers for
help.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of favoring making English the official language, the
new platform would consider English ''our common language.'' It
encourages ''respect for other languages and cultures throughout
our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The draft proposes pulling out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty with the required six months notice if Russia does not agree
to change it to permit a ''robust'' national defense system.
</P>
<P>
   It presents as the ''central values of our party and our
country'' a reduced role for government, more personal liberty,
''economic freedom,'' reliance on the market and decentralized
decision-making.

<HEADLINE> Condom vending machines for sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - New York state has a special deal for
anyone interested in owning seven, slightly used condom vending
machines.
</P>
<P>
   The machines will be sold through a sealed bid process that ends
Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The used vending machines are from the Rochester Psychiatric
Center, which installed dispensers in restrooms across its campus
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The center prohibits sexual contact between patients, but
''recognizes it is possible for sexual activity to occur'' and
''has a responsibility to protect'' patients from the transmission
of life-threatening disease, said Bob Riley, spokesman for the
center.
</P>
<P>
   The seven dispensers being sold were no longer necessary and are
considered surplus. The center is keeping several other dispensers.
</P>
<P>
   But who will buy condom vending machines?
</P>
<P>
   State officials admit they're not sure, and the dispensers might
not get any bidders - meaning a $185 loss on the cost of an ad that
ran in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pretty unusual item,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of new condom vending machines is estimated at $100 to
$150. Bids on used dispensers listed at eBay - the online
marketplace - ranged from $25 to $79 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Office of General Services sold 4,900 surplus
items, including 2,400 vehicles, generating $4.8 million in sales
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the most part, the revenue far exceeds the cost of
advertising,'' said Gibson. ''It's a very successful program for
the state. This is an out-of-the ordinary case.''
</P>
<P>
   If the dispensers aren't sold, the state may give them away to a
nonprofit charity.

<HEADLINE> Ocean City considers ban on smoking in restaurants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OCEAN CITY, N.J. (AP) - Ocean City is considering a ban on
smoking in the resort community's eating establishments.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was introduced at a City Council meeting Thursday,
but the city solicitor urged the council to wait until a Superior
Court judge rules on a challenge to a similar ban in Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   The Ocean City measure would prohibit smoking at all sit-down
restaurants and require them to post no-smoking signs. Earlier this
year, the city banned tobacco vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people crowded into the council chambers to discuss
the ordinance Thursday night, The Press of Atlantic City reported.
</P>
<P>
   Joann Delvescio, director of the Greater Ocean City Chamber of
Commerce, said her group would prefer that individual businesses be
allowed to set their own policy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would still prefer not to see it legislated,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But a student who works in a local restaurant said it's a health
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids like me who work in (Ocean City) restaurants should not
have to inhale carcinogenic materials,'' said Chris Pagnani, a
Vanderbilt University freshman.
</P>
<P>
   The National Smokers Alliance and owners of several Princeton
bar owners are suing to block enforcement of a broad anti-smoking
ordinance there. It prohibits lighting up in virtually all
buildings open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Ocean City Solicitor Gerald Corcoran suggested that the council
wait to see how that case turns out before taking further action on
the ordinance, which passed on first reading 4-2.

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives for N. Korea Talks  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW PENNINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
came to Thailand on Friday to meet with North Korea's foreign
minister, the highest-level meeting in half a century of hostility
between the United States and the communist nation.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is expected to seek curbs on North Korea's missiles,
and North Korea is expected to renew demands for an end to economic
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary of state likely will press Foreign Minister Paek
Nam Sun for details on the North's recent offer to turn its efforts
to develop ballistic missiles into a program focused on the
peaceful launch of satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department described the talks as introductory, and
said no major deals were expected.
</P>
<P>
   Upon her arrival, Albright paid a courtesy call on Thai Prime
Minister Chuan Leekpai and headed to the riverside hotel where
Asian foreign ministers have been meeting all week to discuss
security.
</P>
<P>
   Albright consulted the foreign minister of China, Pyongyang's
largest ally. They described their talks as ''very good.'' She also
was to meet South Korea's Lee Jong-binn before seeing Paek.
</P>
<P>
   Albright wore a canary yellow dress, similar to her last trip to
Asia when a ''sunshine dress'' paid tribute to South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung's so-called sunshine policy to build peace
with the North.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned by reporters at his hotel, Paek said he did not know
how successful the talks would be.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans asked to meet me, so I expect them to say
something,'' Paek remarked. ''If that happens, I will state our
position.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about news reports that North Korea would dispatch a
high-level delegation to Washington to discuss improving ties, Paek
said that the United States has been seeking such an encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the atmosphere is not ripe yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Before such a meeting takes place, North Korea has said that it
wants the United States to end economic sanctions and remove it
from the list of countries it says sponsor terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Albright nearly missed a chance to meet the North Korean, but
was freed from Washington after the Mideast peace summit collapsed.
She nonetheless missed Thursday's induction of North Korea into
Asia's largest security forum, a move to end decades of isolation
after the June summit between leaders of the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have expressed skepticism over North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il's recent proposal, in a meeting with Russia's
president, to transform the missile program into efforts focused on
the peaceful launch of satellites.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. officials have said Washington could accept North
Korean satellites being launched from neutral sites, such as the
South Pacific, but they ruled out selling boosters or technology
that could improve the North's rocketry.
</P>
<P>
   Paek has had a whirlwind of meetings over three days -- including
the North's first with a South Korean foreign minister -- and
received a big welcome into the security forum Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Canada announced diplomatic relations with the North and New
Zealand was widely expected to do so Friday when Foreign Minister
Phil Goff meets Paek.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's desire to erect missile defense systems over East
Asia and its own territory annoyed other nations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, China and Vietnam, which is taking over the rotating
chairmanship of the forum, joined in opposing a reported U.S.
proposal to expand a planned missile theater defense -- originally
just to protect U.S. troops in Japan and South Korea -- to instead
cover all of East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   That would end all ambiguity over whether the system could
protect Taiwan, enraging Beijing, which views Taiwan as a renegade
province and U.S. attempts to defend it as interference in China's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said Thursday that
no decision had been made and the system would not necessarily
cover Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States also came under fire for taking steps to
develop a national missile defense over its own territory in
response to the perceived threat of missiles from North Korea,
Iraq, and other so-called countries of concern.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, China and U.S. allies in the European Union say the
national shield violates arms control treaties and could trigger a
dangerous new arms race.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the most recent tests of the national defense,
however, has lent new urgency to talks with the North Koreans.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of 37,000 U.S. troops in South Korea is a lingering
legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War.

<HEADLINE> Pilots Reprimanded in Osprey Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Marine Corps disciplined two pilots deemed
partly responsible for a sequence of mistakes and misjudgments that
led to the crash of an MV-22 Osprey aircraft in April, killing 19
Marines.
</P>
<P>
   The action was taken against the pilot and co-pilot of an Osprey
that was flying a short distance ahead of the one which crashed
while trying to land at Marana airport in Arizona on April 8.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle, the head of Marine aviation, told a
Pentagon news conference Thursday that an internal review board
concluded that the two pilots of the lead Osprey were partly
responsible because they failed to follow the flight plan and put
themselves in a position of having to descend too rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the pilots of the first aircraft to continue
their approach to the airport -- instead of pulling up and trying a
new, safer approach -- despite an excessive rate of descent
''resulted in the mishap aircraft chasing (the lead aircraft) into
the (landing) area,'' a summary of the accident investigation
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The crews of neither Osprey ''recognized the dangerous potential
of the flight profile,'' the summary said.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said the two pilots will not be allowed to fly as
aircraft commanders of any Marine Corps aircraft for six months,
and after that period they will be required to requalify for that
designation. He did not identify the pilots and said details of the
disciplinary action are ''privileged information.''
</P>
<P>
   An investigation report summary released by McCorkle said that
although the crew of the Osprey which crashed made mistakes, the
main cause of the accident was ''human factors,'' not pilot error.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain the difference, McCorkle said the pilot and
co-pilot of both aircraft had committed ''human factor errors.''
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said it appears in retrospect that the pilots should
have broken off their approaches to the airport and circled for
another landing attempt. As to why they did not, he said he could
only speculate that, ''as Marines, they were trying to complete the
mission.''
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of events and mistakes that apparently led to the
crash began with both Ospreys arriving at their final approaches to
the airport 2,000 feet higher than the mission had called for.
</P>
<P>
   McCorkle said the attention of the co-pilot in the lead aircraft
was distracted at a point when the pilot should have begun his
descent, and so the descent was begun late at an accelerated rate.
The co-pilot apparently dropped a map or some other article in the
cockpit and spent 25 seconds searching for it, McCorkle.
</P>
<P>
   The lead aircraft began its descent at an estimated 1,200 feet
per minute -- far in excess of the maximum recommended rate -- and a
tail wind estimated at between eight and 15 knots aggravated the
problem. The pilot of the second Osprey followed a similar pattern,
but at an even faster rate of descent. He apparently fell into an
uncontrollable nose dive after making a 15 degree banking maneuver,
McCorkle said.
</P>
<P>
   The Osprey is unique in its ability to take off like a
helicopter, rotate its propellers 95 degrees and fly like an
airplane. A group of four Ospreys were participating in a mock
''noncombatant evacuation'' exercise at Marana, about 30 miles
northwest of Tucson, when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The too-rapid approach of the second Osprey produced a
phenomenon known as ''vortex ring state'' -- essentially a stall,
the investigators concluded. The Osprey plunged into a fatal nose
dive, killing the crew of four and their 15 passengers.
</P>
<P>
   The crash was the worst aviation disaster for the Marines since
22 were killed in a helicopter crash in South Korea in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps halted flights of its remaining Ospreys after
the April 8 accident, then resumed flying in early June.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps had previously announced that investigators
found no evidence of mechanical, engineering or structural flaws in
the Osprey. The final report released Thursday affirmed that
finding.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers -- Boeing Co. and Bell Helicopter Textron -- are
due to deliver 11 Ospreys to the Marines this year. Eventually the
Marines are to field 360 of them to replace the corps' Vietnam-era
CH-46 helicopters as the primary means of transporting troops into
combat from ships offshore.

<HEADLINE> Copyright Always Tied To Technolgy  </HEADLINE>
By OWEN S. GOOD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The music industry was in an uproar. In
parlors and saloons across the country, people loaded cylinders
into player pianos, pumped the pedals, and out came the tunes,
without a penny paid to the composers or the sheet music
publishers. Something, they screamed, had to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1908. It was, in a sense, the Ragtime Napster.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Napster is sending shockwaves through the recording
industry. But the spasms over the free Internet music service are
consistent with other times when copyright law seemed unable to
cope with an unanticipated, wildly popular invention.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every one of the new technologies, had you been there at the
debate, you would have heard that this technology was the killer
application,'' said Marybeth Peters, the register of copyrights for
the U.S. Copyright Office. ''The debate really happened like you
are hearing it today.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge in San Francisco issued a preliminary injunction
Wednesday shutting down Napster at the request of the Recording
Industry Association of America, which had sued the online company
in December for copyright infringement.
</P>
<P>
   Music has been protected by copyright since 1831. But copyright
protection was limited only to a tangible form -- such as sheet
music -- and not reproduction of the sound itself.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody had ever conceived of a copy of something that you
couldn't see in the work,'' Peters said. A copy, by law, had to be
''visually perceptible,'' and the Supreme Court in 1908 held that
player piano rolls were not copies of musical composition. A
general revision of the law the next year resolved the problem,
Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1960s, the introduction of audio cassette recorders
led to widespread street piracy of albums, Peters said. That
prompted an amendment in 1972 protecting sound recordings -- the
physical product, and not just the music -- for the first time, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The recording and motion picture industries have tried
repeatedly since then to stop copying. The motion picture industry
sued Sony Corp. over its Betamax videocassette recorder in 1984,
claiming the VCR aided piracy of movies, and lost.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Supreme Court said, 'No, you can have home VCRs,''' said
Steven A. Hetcher, a professor of law at Vanderbilt University.
''As long as the technology can be used legally, you can't force
the maker to stop making it.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. copyright law includes a ''doctrine of fair use'' which
allows copies to be made and used without permission depending on,
among other things, if the copying is for a nonprofit purpose, and
the possible effect on the market for the work. The doctrine calls
for a case-by-case analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has always been a concept that certain uses of
copyrighted works will be tolerated when, in fact, there is no
economic harm to the copyright owner,'' Peters said.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the threat of inexpensive digital recorders capable
of creating near-perfect copies of tapes or compact discs, the RIAA
collaborated with the consumer electronics industry to push for
legislation that became the Audio Home Recording Act of 1992. That
set electronic standards for recorders that prevented the serial
copying of CDs and cassettes. But, said Cary Sherman, general
counsel for the RIAA, it did not cover computers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The computer industry was given the option of participating,''
said Sherman, who worked on the law. ''And they made a very clear
decision not to, because they don't believe in any legislation that
mandates technical standards.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the World Wide Web was three years from its
mainstream debut and use in millions of homes worldwide. The
Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998 dealt largely with
software piracy and posting copyrighted material on Web sites.
Napster, however, does not copy the material itself; it merely
introduces a user to a copy of a song on another user's hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's reasonable to perceive this as a new level of danger we
haven't seen before,'' said Hetcher, who represented the RIAA from
1992 to 1996. ''The reason is all previous technology could not
make perfect copies.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Hetcher said, the law can cope with it this time.
</P>
<P>
   ''The laws are in place already,'' he said. ''It's the
technology they can't control. It's not a matter of finding a way
to make things illegal that should be. They are already.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Howard Coble, R-N.C., the chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on courts and intellectual property, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, the court decision will be enough,'' said Coble,
who has pushed for stricter enforcement of intellectual property
statutes. ''I think there are adequate laws that address this
problem.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel Approves Tax Bill  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- House lawmakers seeking to stave off a trade
war with Europe approved legislation that would end $4.1 billion in
annual tax breaks given to 6,000 U.S. companies that set up export
subsidiaries in offshore tax havens.
</P>
<P>
   In place of those breaks, the Ways and Means Committee voted
overwhelmingly Thursday to create new tax breaks applied equally to
exports by American companies and products they manufacture abroad.
The Clinton administration supports the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Expanding the class of companies that could benefit would cost
U.S. taxpayers $300 million more a year than the current system,
experts estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Among the biggest potential beneficiaries are U.S. arms
manufacturers, according to lawmakers. Some Democrats, including
Rep. Fortney ''Pete'' Stark, D-Calif., objected to those breaks.
Nonetheless, Stark was the lone opposing vote in the 34-1 tally.
</P>
<P>
   The World Trade Organization ruled earlier this year that the
current program is an illegal export subsidy, as the European Union
claimed. The United States faces an Oct. 1 deadline to comply or
face possible EU retaliation in the form of higher tariffs or other
trade sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would satisfy the WTO's objections by creating a
new system of taxes to replace a special exception, lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials were ecstatic after the committee's
34-1 vote sent the bill to the full House, which is expected to
take it up in September after Congress returns from its impending
summer recess. The Senate has yet to act.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are frankly thrilled by the outcome,'' Deputy Treasury
Secretary Stuart Eizenstat told reporters in a conference call
after the vote. He said the measure was ''a remarkable cooperative
effort among the administration, the Congress and the business
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Sales Corporation program, created in 1984, enables
some 6,000 companies, including Microsoft, Boeing, General Motors
and United Technologies, to reduce income taxes by 15 percent by
creating export subsidiaries in offshore tax havens, notably in the
Caribbean. It was designed to offset an EU tax rebate given to
European companies for products sold overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Some corporate executives have warned that if it were to
disappear, the United States could lose a competitive edge that
would eventually result in higher prices, fewer jobs and lower
profits.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the committee's chairman,
insisted the legislation ''is critical for continued U.S.
competitiveness in the global marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would bring the U.S. tax system closer to those
in several European countries.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said any loss of income for Caribbean countries and
territories caused by termination of the Foreign Sales Corporation
program is expected to be ''extremely modest.''
</P>
<P>
   An EU official in Washington, also speaking anonymously, said
that ''considerable effort seems to have been made'' but the
legislation will have to be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   European authorities are believed to be developing a preliminary
list of $26 billion of American products, or 17 percent of U.S.
exports to EU member countries, that would be targets of
retaliatory sanctions, according to the European American Business
Council.

<HEADLINE> Downey Jr.'s Lawyers Urge Release  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Robert Downey Jr. should be released from
prison immediately because a judge did not specify how his
sentences for drug offenses should be served, the actor's lawyers
told an appeals court.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's served a year and he should have been out in February,''
attorney Ross Nabatoff said Thursday. ''This is a sad tale.''
</P>
<P>
   When Superior Court Judge Lawrence Mira sentenced Downey to
three years on drug charges, he failed to say whether that sentence
would run concurrently or consecutively with three previous
misdemeanor convictions against the actor, the lawyer argued.
</P>
<P>
   They said the law provides that any sentence not otherwise
specified runs concurrently.
</P>
<P>
   Downey had already served nearly two months in a drug
rehabilitation center as part of a 15-month sentence for the
misdemeanor convictions of driving under the influence, carrying an
unloaded weapon in his car and being under the influence, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey Kahan argued that the law cited
by Downey's lawyers deals only with multiple sentences which have
not yet been imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Downey, 34, earned an Oscar nomination for his work in the title
role of ''Chaplin.'' Other film credits include ''Less Than Zero,''
''Natural Born Killers'' and ''U.S. Marshals.''

<HEADLINE> Ice-T Prison Show Angers Officials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A performance by Ice-T at the Southern Desert
Correctional Center has outraged some Nevada corrections officials.
</P>
<P>
   The rapper was the subject of intense criticism in the 1990s
over his band Body Count's song ''Cop Killer,'' which many said
condoned violence against police officers.
</P>
<P>
   The concert took place Sunday at a medium security prison that
houses more than 1,500 inmates. Ice-T did not perform ''Cop
Killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Flagg, president of the Nevada Corrections Association,
called the concert ''ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it shows a complete lack of respect for the officers
who work in the prisons on a daily basis with these inmates,''
Flagg said.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the concert did not go through the proper channels
within the Department of Prisons to gain approval, said department
spokesman Howard Skolnik. State officials are investigating to see
if disciplinary measures should be taken.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Ice-T did not return a phone call seeking
comment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher Friday despite a report
that revealed surprising strength in the economy, suggesting that
inflationary pressures may not be easing.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 15 minutes of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 59.75 at 10,594.97.
</P>
<P>
   Among broader stock indicators, the technology-driven Nasdaq
composite index was up 19.75 at 3,861.98, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index was up 2.16 at 1,451.78, and the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies was down 0.46 at 501.15.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on the
New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq Stock Market,
</P>
<P>
   Before the open, the Commerce Department reported that the U.S.
economy, once again confounding the experts, grew at a robust
annual rate of 5.2 percent in the spring, as a surge in investment
by American businesses offset a slowdown in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   The increase in the gross domestic product -- the broadest
measure of economic health -- in the just-ended April-June quarter
surpassed growth in the first quarter, when the economy was growing
at a 4.8 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
   However, an inflation gauge tied to the report and favored by
Federal Reserve officials showed that prices rose at an annual rate
of just 2.3 percent in the second quarter, down from a first
quarter rate of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the unexpected acceleration in activity during the second
quarter came as a surprise to economists, who had widely forecast
that the economy had slowed in the spring under the impact of a
series of Fed interest rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   The spring slowdown has now been erased and economic data
released this week indicate that the current third quarter is
starting at a strong pace as well. On Thursday, the government
released data showing that new orders for big-ticket manufactured
goods surged by 10 percent in June while Americans' wages and
benefits rose over the past 12 months at the fastest pace in nine
years.
</P>
<P>
   All of these factors, unless they are mitigated by signs of
slowing in the next few weeks, may force the Fed to boost interest
rates for a seventh time at its next meeting on Aug. 22 to keep
inflation in check.

<HEADLINE> B-52s Singer Decries Lobster Fest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKLAND, Maine (AP) -- Fred Schneider of the B-52s wants folks
to forgo Maine's signature seafood: lobster.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, who co-wrote the song ''Rock Lobster,'' which helped
propel the band to fame, urges people to boycott next week's Maine
Lobster Festival in a radio commercial that airs this weekend in
New England.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've always sung the praises of lobsters, and it really burns
my butt when people drop 'em in a pot of boiling water. So take off
those bibs and skip the Lobster Festival,'' Schneider proclaims as
''Rock Lobster'' plays in the background during the 30-second spot.
</P>
<P>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals has targeted the
lobster festival for the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider produced the PETA radio commercial while at Boston's
Fleet Pavilion for the only New England stop on the band's summer
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just go to the beach. The sand is crawling with big red,
slow-moving creatures to enjoy. They're called sunburned
tourists,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Diversity at Venice Film Festival  </HEADLINE>
By CANDICE HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- The Venice Film Festival has cast a wide net this
year, scooping up a diverse crop of movies for its 57th edition.
The festival begins with a tribute to Clint Eastwood and ends with
a tale of passion and jealousy among Andalusian Gypsies.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood will be honored with the Golden Lion career achievement
award at opening night on the Lido, organizers said Friday. His
films will be screened throughout the 10-day festival. Organizers
even rounded up some episodes of ''Rawhide,'' the TV series that
launched his career 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The 18 films in competition come from around the globe: India,
Iran, France, South Korea, Hong Kong, Portugal, France, Britain,
Italy, Australia and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Festival director Alberto Barbera said Friday that organizers
for the festival, which runs from Aug. 30-Sept. 9, sought out
quality films that might be overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   ''In times of progressive globalization, the distance between
the center of cinema and its peripheries is getting greater,'' he
said in unveiling the program.
</P>
<P>
   The festival has fewer Hollywood offerings than last year, which
featured films like ''Eyes Wide Shut,'' ''Fight Club,'' ''Cider
House Rules'' and ''Being John Malkovich.''
</P>
<P>
   Two independent films from the United States will screen in
competition: Robert Altman's ''Dr. T and the Women,'' starring
Richard Gere, Helen Hunt, Laura Dern and Liv Tyler, and Julian
Schnabel's ''Before Night Falls,'' with Johnny Depp and Hector
Babenco.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Stephen Frears, director of ''Dangerous Liaisons'' and
''The Grifters,'' will be competing with his new ''Liam'' and
France's Xavier Beauvois offers ''Selon Matthieu,'' featuring
Nathalie Baye, honored as best actress at last year's festival.
</P>
<P>
   Out of competition, Venice features a new Woody Allen movie,
''Small Time Crooks,'' with Allen, Elaine May, Hugh Grant and
Tracey Ullman.
</P>
<P>
   Also showing out of competition will be French director Claude
Chabrol's ''Merci Pour le Chocolat,'' with Isabelle Hupert and
Jacques Dutronc, and Japanese director Takeshi Kitano's
''Brother.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Vengo,'' a Franco-Spanish production directed by Tony Gatlif,
closes the festival. Barbera described it as a tale of passion and
jealousy performed by Andalusian Gypsies.

   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - FOR SALE OR LEASE: 2.9 million gross square
feet of floor space on 350-plus shaded acres. Excellent highway
access, service roads and parking. Sixteen buildings, one designed
to withstand a nuclear bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the real estate listing might look like should the
Pataki administration decide to privatize all or part of the Gov.
W. Averell Harriman State Office Building Campus in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   A New York City consultant is expected to report in September on
the best future uses for the complex, including the cost of
upgrading the buildings to year 2000 standards and the potential
advantages to the state treasury and local tax rolls of bringing in
private companies as owners or tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The disposition of the Harriman campus property is one aspect of
a $240 million-plus, long-term plan for the accommodation of the
state work force in and around the capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Other features of the ''Albany Plan'' have already taken shape,
including the ongoing construction of two office towers in downtown
Albany to house the state comptroller's office and the state
Department of Environmental Conservation. A 2,400-space parking
garage adjacent to the Empire State Plaza office complex in Albany
is nearly finished.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Albany Mayor Jerry Jennings hopes the Harriman
study will result in the state relinquishing the current tax-exempt
status of what is potentially some of his city's most attractive
office space.
</P>
<P>
   ''The privatization of the campus is totally consistent with our
Albany Plan, which the governor and I believe will result in the
continued revitalization of our urban center and the expansion of
the city's tax base,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others caution that a decision to lease or sell off the
Harriman complex is not to be entered into lightly or rashly.
</P>
<P>
   State Assemblyman Jack McEneny remembers when the ''sand plain''
in west Albany was being fashioned in the late 1950s into the
Harriman complex. The bulldozers kicked up so much sand and dust
that the clocks in the McEneny home got clogged and stopped
working, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, city and state leaders favored the complex being
built on what was then the outskirts of the city as a way of easing
tight office space demands and congestion downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the design called for 20 major office buildings
spaced evenly around a 2.5-mile inner loop of highway. Sixteen
major buildings were eventually built, and today they are work
sites for some 9,000 state employees in agencies ranging from the
state police to the departments of taxation and finance,
transportation and labor.
</P>
<P>
   The project was scaled back somewhat when Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller became enthralled with an exciting new approach to
providing work space to state workers - his grandiose,
billion-dollar Empire State Plaza project next door to the state
Capitol. Some 11,000 state employees now work in the complex.
</P>
<P>
   The Harriman campus, with its utilitarian buildings and
campus-like setting - there is little to distinguish it from the
State University at Albany next door - has always been the low-key
cousin of the Empire State Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not on many postcards,'' McEneny said.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1991 and early 1992, the Harriman complex did gain
notice, however. In those months, Building 8 on the campus, housing
the tax department, had to be repeatedly evacuated because workers
were being sickened by chemical fumes. It took months for the
problem to be cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   Still, employees generally seem to like to work in Building 8
and in the Harriman complex, said T.J. O'Donnell, local president
for the Civil Service Employees Association at the tax department.
</P>
<P>
   ''One big thing is there is good parking,'' O'Donnell said.
''There are plenty of trees where people can walk around and have
their lunches outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War era in which the complex was built has left its
stamp on the office complex. Deep beneath State Police headquarters
building is a bunker housing a nerve center for police, National
Guard and other personnel that is used at times of natural or
man-made emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   But the bunker was built with a more catastrophic disaster in
mind - nuclear war. It was designed to withstand the detonation of
a nuclear bomb at the typical ''blast zone'' of 2,000 feet over the
ground. The building upstairs would be wiped out, of course,
architects calculated, but the bunker would be intact for surviving
state officials to carry on.
</P>
<P>
   Another fallout of the era of the campus' construction is their
lack of accommodation for the computers and other electronic
fixtures of modern offices. In the early 1990s, a state study
placed the cost of renovating and modernizing the buildings on the
campus at more than $312 million.
</P>
<P>
   Those expenses will be one of the considerations of the
consultants studying the future of the complex. Another will be the
costs of relocating the campus' 9,000 employees to other work
spaces if privatization is deemed to be the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   McEneny said he favors an arrangement where the state would
lease buildings on the campus to suitable private companies -
insurance firms, high-tech companies, computer companies and the
like - while retaining title to the property.
</P>
<P>
   ''It depends on the buildings, and some of them are very
institutional,'' he said. ''They were not elegant when they were
put up and they are well behind the times.''
</P>
<P>
   By holding onto the property, the state can preserve the option
of someday incorporating the complex into the University at Albany
in case that college someday outgrows its current campus, McEneny
said.

   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The lone American killed on the Concorde
crash was a New Jersey native traveling home on his favorite plane
to see his sister.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Behrens ''just worshiped the Concorde,'' sister
Rachel Coats said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, a retired sales and promotion executive for Air France,
took the supersonic jet ''whenever he could travel in it, and it's
just so ironic that it took his life,'' said Coats, 71, of Clinton
Township, Hunterdon County.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, 65, was one of 114 people killed on Tuesday after Air
France Flight 4590 caught fire while taking off in Paris and
crashed into a small hotel outside the city. Investigators have
focused on engine No. 2 as the probable source of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, who lived in Frankfurt, Germany, was flying back to New
York to make an annual visit to Coats, she said. He had lived in
Germany since 1961, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He loved it there,'' she said. ''He kept meaning to come back,
but instead it was always visits.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens was born in Woodbridge to German-born parents and became
fluent in German after speaking the language at home.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to New York City shortly after graduating from high
school to work for Lufthansa, the German airline, before moving to
Europe, relatives said.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, who lived alone and had no children, ''was just a
wonderful human being,'' Coats said. ''The life of the party
without being silly. He had lots of friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens has another sister, Therese, in Vero Beach, Fla., and
several cousins in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Behrens was married to Behrens' late cousin, Roland,
who grew up on the same street. She last saw Christopher Behrens at
an Annandale restaurant a year ago to celebrate Coats' 50th wedding
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just a really fun guy to be with,'' Behrens said. ''He
just always made you feel really special when he talked to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Coats said funeral arrangements for Behrens had not been
made. She had not yet decided whether to travel to the accident
site in France.

<HEADLINE> Ring Operas Getting Mixed Reviews  </HEADLINE>
By WOLFGANG HUEBNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAYREUTH, Germany (AP) -- A new production of Richard Wagner's
landmark Ring cycle that jolts the mythic opera's most complex work
into the industrial age is being greeted with mixed reviews at this
year's Bayreuth Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Juergen Flimm, celebrated director of the renowned Thalia
theater in Hamburg, places the mythical German gods in a stunning
modern world in his staging of the four-part ''Ring des
Nibelungen,'' which premiered Wednesday night with the debut of
''Das Rheingold.''
</P>
<P>
   The respected Sueddeutsche Zeitung wrote in its review Friday
that part one, at least, is among ''the most entertaining pieces
seen (at the festival) in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   With sets by Erich Wonder and costumes by Florence von Gerkan,
dwarf ruler Alberich descends to the underworld in an elevator and
carries a plastic bag emblazoned with the logo of a popular German
discount store. His lair is an ostentatious office from which, as
an industrial boss, he harangues his high-tech slaves.
</P>
<P>
   But boos could be distinctly heard amid the applause Thursday
night after the six-hour premiere of the second part, ''Die
Walkuere.'' Despite the strong performances from superstars Placido
Domingo as Siegmund, Waltraud Meier as Sieglinde, American Alan
Titus as Wotan, the head god, and Gabriele Schnaut as Bruennhilde,
some critics called the production disappointing and lacking in
magic.
</P>
<P>
   The production, the ninth at Bayreuth since World War II, forces
the singers into constant movement. Their use of modern gestures
adds to the contemporary feel of the German classic.
</P>
<P>
   Flimm's highly anticipated production replaces the Alfred
Kirchner staging, conducted by the Metropolitan Opera's James
Levine, which was used from 1994-98.
</P>
<P>
   The 89th edition festival, almost always sold out months in
advance, opened Tuesday with ''Parsifal'' in this Bavarian town,
where Wagner had the Festspielhaus theater built to his
specifications for the premiere of the 17-hour Ring in 1876.
</P>
<P>
   Hans Sotin, a 29-year Bayreuth veteran, was scheduled to sing
Guernemanz, but dropped out because of creative difference with
conductor Christoph Eschenbach and was replaced by Matthias Hoelle.
Paol Elming sang the title role.
</P>
<P>
   The festival has been clouded in recent years by debates within
the Wagner family over whether it needs to be changed to survive in
today's society.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Wagner, the composer's grandson and the festival's
director for nearly 50 years, has been pushing his wife and
longtime assistant Gudrun as his successor.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the composer's great-great grandchildren, Nike
Wagner, say changes are needed, including an expansion of the
repertoire from the 10 mature Wagner works -- and even including
operas by other composers.
</P>
<P>
   Eva Wagner-Pasquier and Wieland Lafferentz, also great-grand
children of Wagner, also are competing to become director. A vote
was pushed back to October.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Cheers Chelsea's Sabbatical  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   BARRINGTON, R. I. (AP) -- President Clinton on Friday cheered
daughter Chelsea's decision to take a quarter off from college to
help her mother's Senate campaign and be with him during his last
days in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's already got way more credits than she needs to graduate.
She wants to be with her mother and me for these last few months of
our time together,'' Clinton said. He noted that his daughter spent
''about a third of her life'' in the White House and would like to
have more time there as well.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke upon his arrival here for a clambake that was
bringing in $450,000 for the re-election campaign of Rep. Patrick
Kennedy, D-R.I. Chelsea was not with him; Clinton was accompanied
by Kennedy and his uncle, Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 people greeted the president. At one point, a golden
retriever puppy named Bogey sat on the president's shoes as he
shook hands with the crowd. Clinton gently coaxed the puppy off his
shoes, then stepped over him and continued working the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Kennedy clambake was the first event on a day of fund
raising for Democratic candidates. Two events being held later
Friday in Boston were to raise $950,000 for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Thursday that Chelsea Clinton, 20, would
skip the start of her senior year at Stanford this fall to help
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's Senate campaign and to spend
more time with her father, who leaves office in January. The
president said his daughter remains on track to graduate with her
class next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wants to be able to help her mother. She also wants to be
able to keep company with her father, which is always a surprising
thing, when your children grow up and want to spend time with
you,'' Clinton said. ''It's been a great comfort to Hillary and me
to have her around more. It is just a family decision that she
wanted to make.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also used the occasion to continue to drum on
Republicans, for the third consecutive day, for their proposed tax
cuts. Clinton noted that the economy has continued to grow, at an
annual rate of 5.2 percent in the spring, and he vowed that he
would not, in his last months in office, allow that growth to be
jeopardized by tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the GOP tax proposals could consume upwards of $2
trillion over the years, and would devour all of the projected
budget surplus that he wants earmarked for salvaging Social
Security and Medicare, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fiscal discipline has put America on the right track. And on
my watch we will stay on the right track,'' Clinton said. ''The
rest of the decision is up to the American people, but we will not
squander the surplus as long as I am here. We will not.''

<HEADLINE> Mugging victim hopes for return of lost dog  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Fred Myer was walking his two dogs when he
stopped to help a bicyclist who asked for directions to a pizza
shop.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, a gun was pointed at the dogs, and the bicyclist
was demanding money.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started giving him directions and he said, 'Never mind the
pizza place, give me your wallet or I'll shoot you and your
dogs,''' Myer told The Buffalo News in Friday's editions. ''I could
see he had a gun pointed at my dogs, and I just reacted and swatted
the gun away.''
</P>
<P>
   The robber jumped off his bicycle, knocked the 66-year-old Myer
to the ground and punched him repeatedly in the left eye. After
wrestling away Myer's wallet containing $80 and credit cards, the
robber fled.
</P>
<P>
   ''Luckily the gun turned out to be a toy,'' Myer said. His luck
ran out when it came to his dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They aren't trained to be attack dogs,'' he said. ''They
panicked and took off.''
</P>
<P>
   Shiloh, the 16-month-old male, returned a week ago after
spending a night wandering, but Charm, the 13-month-old female,
remains on the loose.
</P>
<P>
   Myers, a bachelor, considers his pets his family. He said he has
been living a nightmare for the week since Charm disappeared, even
though neighbors have lent their support by hanging posters, making
phone calls and driving around looking for the dog.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the robber is responsible for a string of more
than 15 robberies starting in February.

<HEADLINE> Milan pleads innocent to corruption charges, judge sets jury selection date </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A relaxed and smiling Mayor Milton Milan
pleaded innocent Friday to a new indictment charging him with
political corruption and said he's ready for his trial to begin.
</P>
<P>
   The superseding indictment, like one handed up in March, accuses
the mayor of conspiracy to solicit and accept bribes, wire and mail
fraud, and conspiracy to launder money. The more recent indictment
made minor changes and clarifications to the original indictment
handed up March 29, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Renee M. Bumb.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Joel A. Pisano said jury selection will
begin Oct. 23, and the trial itself will probably start Nov. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos A. Martir Jr., Milan's lawyer, said the trial is expected
to last six to eight weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm feeling good. This is part of the procedure,'' Milan said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there has been no discussion of a plea bargain and that
the trial will ''come down to a paper trail and interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   Milan is free on $150,000 bail; the judge Friday continued his
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, 37, allegedly accepted cash bribes, vacations, dinners,
automobiles and home-improvement work from city vendors or
businesses seeking contracts or favors from the mayor. Authorities
also say Milan laundered more than $60,000 in drug profits.
</P>
<P>
   He also allegedly took more than $30,000 in payments made at the
direction of former Philadelphia-South Jersey mob boss Ralph Natale
in return for help obtaining city contracts and for official
favors. Natale has been cooperating with federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Natale in May admitted using an associate to bribe Milan in
return for favors to mob-influenced businesses and contractors.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also says Milan helped stage a burglary at a
contracting company to collect insurance payments on a leased
photocopy machine, two computers and printers.
</P>
<P>
   Milan allegedly kept one of the computers for his own use for
about a year and a half, then sold it to an intern in his office
for about $1,500 to $1,000 above the normal resale value for that
computer.

<HEADLINE> WWII Swiss Slave Labor Checked  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- An independent panel looking into
Switzerland's World War II past is checking whether Swiss firms had
links to slave labor in Nazi Germany or elsewhere, the head of the
commission said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 companies have opened their archives for general
research and their cooperation has been good, said Jean-Francois
Bergier. However, investigators looking specifically at the slave
labor issue are focusing on a dozen firms, said commission
secretary Linus von Castelmur.
</P>
<P>
   The research is being carried out as part of the international
panel's mandate from the Swiss government to do wide-ranging
research on the wartime period. The commission has issued reports
on Switzerland's gold dealings with Nazi Germany and its wartime
refugee policy.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Switzerland's main employers' association urged
companies that may have used Nazi slave labor during World War II
to come forward under a $1.25 billion out-of-court Holocaust
settlement between the two biggest Swiss banks and Jewish
organizations, Holocaust survivors and heirs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the decision released in New York on Wednesday, if the
firms register within 30 days and cooperate by providing names of
slave laborers, they will be exempted from potential U.S. lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   The association, Vorort, mentioned no corporate names, but some
companies, including those in the metals and food industries,
allegedly used slave labor in German subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The food giant Nestle, which in 1947 acquired a company that is
implicated, said it would take part as long as it receives
assurances it will be protected as the takeover company.
</P>
<P>
   The court decision also omitted specific company names, but said
three Swiss-owned companies that used about 2,500 slave laborers
have been identified.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, research so far has failed to turn up ''significant
information'' on the identities of Swiss companies or their
affiliates that may have used slave labor, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The Zurich-based Blick newspaper reported Friday that Swiss
firms possibly on the list ranged from foie gras producers and
cigar makers to textile manufacturers and chemical firms.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper printed a list of 91 Swiss companies with German
links it said the French occupation forces in Germany compiled in
1946.

<HEADLINE> Groups seek cleanup of Ithaca Falls  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - Environmentalists on Friday said city
leaders were putting the public at risk by developing a park at a
recently acquired site spoiled by lead contamination from a former
gun factory.
</P>
<P>
   The city purchased the 10-acre piece of Fall Creek gorge, which
includes Ithaca Falls, from Cornell University in March for $1.
Although the site is a popular swimming, fishing and hiking area,
the state Department of Environmental Conservation has documented
high levels of lead contamination there from the Ithaca Gun Co.'s
former factory.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Friday, environmentalists demanded the DEC
hold a public meeting about the site's risks, restrict public entry
and impose a 60-day cleanup deadline.
</P>
<P>
   They said the DEC should classify the site as a Category One
Inactive Hazardous Waste Disposal Site - a classification that
means the site has the potential to cause ''irreversible or
irreparable damage to the public health or environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very troubling to me to realize that this high-profile
site can be so contaminated and the contamination can be so widely
known for so long and still nothing has been done,'' said Rich
DePaolo, a spokesman for the Cayuga Lake Defense Fund.
</P>
<P>
   While cleanup of the site has not begun, the city already has
secured state funding, said Tom Suozzo, a DEC environmental
engineer. Ithaca Mayor Alan Cohen said he did not believe that
people visiting the site were in any danger.
</P>
<P>
   Ithaca Gun operated in Ithaca from 1880 to the late 1980s. The
DEC first documented high levels of lead on the property in 1995.
In its most recent testing in 1998, the DEC found lead levels well
above the state's maximum of 400 parts per million and as high as
215,000 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   Lead is a highly toxic element that can cause damage to the
brain and nervous system and behavior and learning problems if its
dust is ingested or inhaled.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Names New Vice Premier  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A former lawmaker and close confidant of
President Chen Shui-bian will be Taiwan's new vice premier,
replacing an official who resigned to take the blame for a botched
rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   Chen approved on Friday the appointment of Chang Chun-hsiung,
62, secretary general of the presidential office from his
Democratic Progressive Party, according to a statement from Chen's
office. The country's police chief and its top fire official also
stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Chang replaces Yu Shyi-kun, who resigned Tuesday over criticism
of the government's failure to rescue four workers trapped in a
weekend flash flood.
</P>
<P>
   It was the biggest crisis so far for Chen, whose government has
been accused of inexperience and lack of expertise since assuming
office in May.
</P>
<P>
   Since Saturday, cable news channels have been showing footage of
the four workers in their straw hats gripping each other as they
stood knee-deep in the rushing waters of the Pachang River in
Chiayi County before they were swept away.
</P>
<P>
   Tang has blamed the delay in rescue operations on faulty
communication between the air force and police teams -- resulting in
the police chopper flying to the scene hours after the workers were
discovered trapped.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have been sensitive about disaster management since
the government was caught off-guard during a massive earthquake in
September. About 2,400 people were killed, thousands of homes
destroyed and hundreds of people were buried under rubble waiting
for help.

<HEADLINE> German Bomb Raises Extremism Fear  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- During their last German class
together, a group of immigrants from the former Soviet Union
discussed Germany's extreme-right movement.
</P>
<P>
   On their way to catch the train home, nine were injured in a
bombing, and authorities said Friday they could not rule out
anti-Semitism or anti-foreigner sentiment as a motive.
</P>
<P>
   All the victims were immigrants from the former Soviet Union --
Russia, Lithuania, Ukraine and Azerbaijan -- and at least six were
also Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't rule out any motive, including an anti-foreigner
motive,'' prosecutor Johannes Mocken told reporters. ''We can't
rule out that someone placed this bomb to hit this group or one
member of it .... or it could be simple coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   A $5,000 reward was offered for information leading to an
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The nine students were with a group heading for their trains to
nearby cities when the device exploded Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Shrapnel shot through the crowded station entrance, causing the
most serious injuries to a Ukranian couple. The 26-year-old woman,
identified only as Tatjana L., was five months pregnant and
miscarried. Her leg was nearly blown off, but doctors were able to
reattach the limb Friday and said her condition was improving.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Michail, 28, was hit in the abdomen and remained in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Classes were canceled Friday at the R. Welling language school,
where the students were taking a six-month German course funded by
the government to help them assimilate.
</P>
<P>
   Their teacher, Olga Pankratz, said the attack changed the mood
at the school. Just Thursday, they had incorporated a discussion of
the extreme-right into the class.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one felt threatened,'' Pankratz said. ''But the attack has
changed everything. ... Now I am afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teacher said Tatjana L. had mastered German in just three
months, and was committed to establishing a new life and family in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was so happy about the baby. It was a child she had
planned to have with her husband that they couldn't afford in
Ukraine,'' Pankratz said. ''She had all the chances. She wanted to
work -- and she would surely have found something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bomb experts were trying to reconstruct the device Friday and
determine how it was set off: A timer would indicated a more random
attack, while remote control could suggest it was targeted at
specific people.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the large amount of shrapnel, officials said the
device might have been a fragmentation grenade or something
homemade.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Jewish community in Germany expressed ''shock
and dismay.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are horrified by this attack on innocent people,'' said
Paul Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
   Germany Interior Minister Otto Schily said it was conceivable
that the act was motivated by anti-foreigner sentiment, but
cautioned against jumping to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not fall into the mistake of creating a mood that
this could happen on every street corner,'' Schily said.
</P>
<P>
   German officials have warned recently that neo-Nazis, while
declining in number, are becoming better organized and increasingly
prone to violence. But their attacks are usually random beatings or
crude Molotov cocktails tossed at specific targets.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Jewish community is going through an unprecedented
renaissance and is one of the fastest growing in the world because
of a a post-Cold War policy of granting German citizenship to Jews
from the former Soviet Union. Germany's Jewish population, which
stood at 500,000 before the Holocaust, was just 30,000 only five
years ago, but has surged to 80,000 as immigrants take advantage of
the policy and is projected to reach 120,000 in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish community in Duesseldorf fits the model. Of its 6,300
members, 5,150 are new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are shocked that this could occur in Duesseldorf, a place
where these things so far have seemed impossible,'' said Michael
Szentei-Heise, the head of the local Jewish community.

<HEADLINE> No Suspects in Two Haiti Blasts  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- A grenade exploded in the driveway
of the Canadian ambassador's residence and police detonated another
at the former U.N. headquarters as tensions over elections results
mounted Friday between Haiti and its international community.
</P>
<P>
   An attacker lobbed the grenade over a low wall surrounding the
residence in suburban Petionville about 10:50 p.m. Thursday,
damaging the ambassador's car but causing no injuries, a Canadian
Embassy official said. Ambassador Gilles Bernier and his wife were
in Canada at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Another grenade turned up Thursday in the courtyard of the
former U.N. civilian mission headquarters in suburban Delmas.
Police detonated that grenade safely.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the Canadian residence was the first act of
violence against the international community since it began
questioning recent election results.
</P>
<P>
   No suspects have been named and the attacks were under
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, police increased security for the 15 Canadians who
work at the embassy, Foreign Affairs spokesman Carl Schwenger said
in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Elections in May, June and July, intended to restore
constitutional government to Haiti, gave former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's Lavalas Family party overwhelming control
of Parliament and of most city and rural councils.
</P>
<P>
   By law, candidates need only a simple majority for a first-round
victory. But officials only counted the votes for the top four
contenders in each race, yielding what observers say were numerous
false Lavalas victories.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign donors and the United Nations, criticial of the method,
have threatened to suspend aid if Haiti fails to revise the results
of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Japan suspended $13.5 million in aid earlier this month because
President Rene Preval, Aristide's hand-picked successor, refused to
hold new elections for 10 disputed Senate seats.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the European Union initiated a procedure that could
suspend a five-year, $200 million aid package.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Canada, Haiti's biggest individual donors,
have also threatened to cut aid. Canada has given Haiti about $180
million since 1994, when U.S. troops intervened to restore
democracy after three years of a repressive military-backed
government.
</P>
<P>
   Another $400 million in international loans were put on hold
after Preval shut down Parliament in January 1999 after an 18-month
showdown with the then-majority party.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition politicians accuse Preval and Aristide of working to
return dictatorship to this impoverished Caribbean nation. The
popular Aristide is expected to win presidential elections in
November.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelans Have Vote Fatigue  </HEADLINE>
By NIKO PRICE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Marlene Blanco helped vote President
Hugo Chavez into a five-year term, believing in the ''social
revolution'' the former coup leader pledged for Venezuela. That was
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen months and five elections later, the 32-year-old
secretary still trusts Chavez. But she isn't about to vote for him
on Sunday. She isn't going to vote at all.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're used to voting every five years. We just got through an
election,'' she said. ''To vote again is just absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   Across Venezuela, people are tired of a seemingly eternal
campaign. Analysts say ''voter fatigue'' could give Sunday's
elections for president, congress, mayors, governors and just about
everything else one of the lowest turnouts in history.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are tired and have lost their faith,'' said Guillermo
Moron, a historian and political commentator. ''We've been in a
campaign since 1998. There hasn't been a single day of rest.''
</P>
<P>
   It started in November 1998, with elections for congress,
governors and mayors. A month later, Chavez stunned the world by
winning the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, he called a nationwide referendum on whether to
draft a new constitution that would replace Venezuela's political
order. He won, and four months later voters chose the group that
would draft that constitution. They voted to approve the new
constitution in December 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new system, all elected offices were to be
''re-legitimized'' in nationwide elections scheduled for May 28,
balloting that would give Chavez a new, six-year term. When the
computer system wasn't ready, officials called off the vote at the
last minute and rescheduled it for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And so the campaigning started up again.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at the end of it all, Chavez's most fervent -- and heartiest
-- supporters say they'll vote one more time, and then expect him to
forget about the elections and start working on the problems on
their minds: the sluggish economy, rampant crime and high
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've voted in all the elections, and I remember every one,''
said Graciela Nunez, a 33-year-old sales clerk. ''It's good that we
all go out to vote. You have to give your opinions. And we have to
give him time to do everything he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's main challenger is Francisco Arias Cardenas, who led a
1992 coup attempt together with Chavez but broke away from the
president this year. Arias has harnessed the anger of the middle
and upper classes, who dislike Chavez's class-driven rhetoric and
who fear he will turn the country into a dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   But most Venezuelans are poor. And thanks in part to his
populist rhetoric in which he denounces the moneyed classes as
enemies of the people, Chavez rides an easy 20 points ahead in the
latest polls. Few expect him to lose, no matter how tired people
may be of voting.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to finish voting for Chavez,'' said Robinson Quintero,
a 45-year-old machinist. ''He's been campaigning for so long, he
hasn't had time to make the radical changes he wants to.''
</P>
<P>
   At the ''hot corner'' of Caracas' central Bolivar Square, about
a dozen unemployed men heatedly debated politics Friday. Only there
wasn't much to debate; all supported Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   These political junkies are far from tired of the elections.
They see Sunday's vote as a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to vote to make this a true democracy,'' said Oscar
Bides, 59.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will be the last election,'' he said, then paused.
''Well, not the last. But there aren't too many more to go.''

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Slips 115; Dow Falls 56  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Friday, led by technology
shares after a new report revealed surprising strength in the
economy and suggested that inflationary pressures may not be easing
after all.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was down 55.87 at 10,530.26 after giving back an
early 62-point gain.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-driven Nasdaq composite index was down 115.17 at
3,727.06, extending Thursday's 145-point slide.
</P>
<P>
   Among other broad-market indicators, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
was down 21.48 at 1,428.14, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies was down 8.41 at 493.20.
</P>
<P>
   Before trading began, the Commerce Department reported that the
U.S. economy grew at a robust annual rate of 5.2 percent in the
spring as a surge in investment by American businesses offset a
slowdown in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   However, an inflation gauge tied to the report and favored by
Federal Reserve officials showed that prices rose at an annual rate
of just 2.3 percent in the second quarter, down from a first
quarter rate of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the unexpected acceleration in activity during the
second quarter came as a surprise to economists, compounding
concerns raised on Thursday by reports showing large increases in
employment costs and big-ticket factory orders.
</P>
<P>
   Unless mitigated by signs of slowing before the next Fed meeting
on Aug. 22, the latest economic readings may force the central bank
to boost interest rates again in a bid to slow the economy and
contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Network equipment makers were prominent among the day's big
decliners with Cisco Systems falling $3.625 to $64.375 as the most
active Nasdaq issue.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, JDS Uniphase slid $8.125 to $120.50 amid news that
Royal Philips Electronics had sold 5 million of its JDS shares. And
Nortel Networks fell $5 to $73.125 after announcing a $7.8 billion
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks helped lead the Dow lower amid the renewed
concerns about interest rates, which could hurt demand for loans.
American Express was down $2.375 at $55.938 and J.P. Morgan was
down $2.375 at $129.813 as the Dow's two weakest components after
Intel, down $3.438 at $133.563.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled 673.88 million shares, down from 784.02
million at the same point on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.12 percent,
Germany's DAX index fell 0.77 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell
0.26 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.47 percent.

<HEADLINE> Woman quits smoking, puts money to lottery, gets payoff  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHNSON CITY, N.Y. (AP) - A woman who gave up smoking then
plowed the savings into lottery tickets got a big pay off.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, Mirdza Abele, 73, of Johnson City won $1,000 a week
for life in the lottery.
</P>
<P>
   She quit her habit of a pack-and-a-half of cigarettes a day nine
years ago for this day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I started crying and crying and crying, I was so happy,''
Abele said.
</P>
<P>
   She is the 79th ''Win For Life'' winner since the game started
in 1994, said Lottery Director Margaret DeFrancisco.
</P>
<P>
   The total prize payout amounts to quarterly payments of roughly
$8,500 after state and federal taxes, DeFrancisco said. She is
guaranteed at least a $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Abele is a retired factory worker who has been living on Social
Security. She said she will put the money toward her three
grandchildren's education, a trip to Riga in her native Latvia -
and more lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Abele, who buys four or five tickets a day, almost forgot to buy
her tickets on July 15.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came home from church and it was dark and raining out and I
realized I'd forgotten to buy the tickets. So I got in the car and
drove down the street to buy them,'' she said in Johnson City, 65
miles south of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Abele, who usually plays Pick 5, bought $10 worth of tickets.
One of them was the scratch-off game for $1,000 for life.

<HEADLINE> Bell Labs pioneers recall their inventions  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE GIEGERICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEPTUNE, N.J. (AP) - From their minds sprung the technologies
we've long taken for granted. Stuff like the ability to gossip with
a co-worker on an intra-office line or to have separate telephone
lines for the family, the kids, the fax machine and the computer
without an exterior decorating scheme that resembles the nearest
power utility substation.
</P>
<P>
   And though their impact was huge, they went about the business
of changing our lives in relative anonymity, shuffling each day to
laboratories, offices and cubicles from comfortable homes located
in comfortable suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Their names and lives were not the stuff of headlines or books,
and they led lives that did not include drawing attention to
themselves with ostentatious spending habits and boorish behavior
in public places. Start-ups, capital investment and IPOs were not a
part of their world.
</P>
<P>
   In short, theirs were the building blocks that provided the
foundation for all that followed. ''(The Bell system) was where all
the stuff we have now started,'' said Bill Lindenberger, of
Middletown. ''That was the incubator.''
</P>
<P>
   One and, sometimes, two generations removed from the so-called
new technology, the engineers that populated Bell Labs in the
1950s, '60s and '70s take a knowing but wary view of the young
technologists in computers and communications who have followed in
their technological footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   For, while they've been there and done that, they did so in a
manner and time when gratification was neither instantaneous nor
fleeting.
</P>
<P>
   Between the day he joined Bell Labs in 1952 and the day he left,
47 years later, Dave Favin, of Little Silver, racked up 26
different patents. That number does not include another 10
inventions Favin produced on behalf of assisting the disabled to
communicate and function via their computers.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure, Favin's credo was simple and, among his
colleagues, universal. Favin articulates it by paraphrasing a
well-known German idiom: ''The thing itself is what matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindenberger's ''thing'' - the antithesis of here today, gone
tomorrow technology - was the development of multiple telephone
lines from a single source, a development that ultimately
necessitated an influx of new area codes to accommodate the
manifold lines extending into many households.
</P>
<P>
   ''We developed things that we knew were not going to become
obsolete. Whatever we developed we developed to last 40 years.
Today it's more like 40 weeks or 40 months,'' said Lindenberger,
whose tenure with the Bell system began in 1951 and stretched into
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Life, like the business of technology, was far different when
the likes of Favin and Lindenberger plied their trade. Bell Labs,
part of the hegemonic Bell system, was a monopoly that controlled
the way the world communicated.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being, in effect, the only game in town until the
federal government splintered AT&AMP;T into Baby Bells in 1984, Bell
Labs (which today is the research arm of AT&AMP;T spinoff Lucent
Technologies Inc.) and its affiliated subsidiaries nonetheless
engendered a level of loyalty all but forgotten in an era when
personal achievement in innovation has taken a backseat to the
almighty dollar.
</P>
<P>
   To Gerry Hohmann, of Little Silver, who ended his 38-year career
with the Bell system in 1989, the natural analogy is sports. ''Look
at the Yankees, DiMaggio and players like that used to stay with
one team their entire lives. There's an exact parallel between
sports and business,'' said Hohmann, lamenting the lack of the
''esprit de corps'' that existed during his heyday.
</P>
<P>
   Added Bell Labs retiree Bob Watson, of Rumson, who signed on
with Bell Labs in 1941: ''There was a lot of loyalty back then. But
now we're into a new system of ethics which is hardly
encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Favin looks with detached amusement at all the hoopla over the
relatively instant riches bestowed upon the so-called Microsoft
millionaires and their dot-com cousins.
</P>
<P>
   ''You know, someone told me many years ago that the secret to a
happy life is to find something you love to do and then find
someone to pay you to do it,'' said Favin. ''My compatriots and I
loved what we were doing and probably would have done it without
pay if they'd asked ... It was the knowledge and the job
satisfaction that drove us. The money was not important.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Favin well understands why, and how, so many
of today's communication and computer engineers strike off on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than disloyalty, he sees it as a matter of access. For,
whereas the engineers of yore were limited by analog computers
dependent on vacuum tubes, today's technologists require only a
basic knowledge of digital computing and rudimentary programming
skills in order to strike out on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Any resentment the Bell Labs ''pioneers'' - the official name of
the company's veterans - have toward the young men and women who
have taken their places on the forefront of technology is tempered
by the knowledge that, without their foundation, a world connected
by the Internet would not have been possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''More power to them,'' said Bill Lindenberger. ''This is the
future.''

<HEADLINE> Burlington County woman hosts local Scrabble Club  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA ESPOSITO
Burlington County Times of Willingboro
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEMBERTON TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - On Thursday nights, a group of
otherwise mild-mannered men and women head to Pemberton Township to
mix things up.
</P>
<P>
   But the battles being fought involve brain, not fire power.
</P>
<P>
   And the mixing is of tiny wooden tiles embossed with the letters
of the alphabet - as well as their point value.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, the Club No. 540 of the National Scrabble Association
meets at the home of director Yolanda Ushry, using the tiles to
form such words as ''quag,'' ''doux'' and ''zyme.''
</P>
<P>
   And you get excited when you find an ''o'' that you can add an
''x'' to.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't kitchen-table Scrabble, said Ushry, who began playing
when she and her husband were both serving in the United States Air
Force. It was a good way to make new friends, since the couple
moved frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, Ushry got so proficient at the game that her family
would no longer play with her. ''My husband bought me the 50th
anniversary edition, and it just sat here and collected dust,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, she discovered the National Scrabble Association, an
affiliate of Hasbro (the company that manufactures the game), which
offers membership services to Scrabble enthusiasts, as well as
oversees tournaments and the establishment of local clubs. Ushry,
who is employed by a trucking firm in Southampton, began attending
the weekly club that meets in Berlin, Camden County. ''I realized I
didn't know how to play the game,'' she said. But she was a quick
study, and soon took the NSA's director's test, a prerequisite for
starting her own club.
</P>
<P>
   She posted notices in convenience and bookstores, as well as
local libraries. And soon, players began to show up at the Thursday
gatherings. Among the first was Fay Novack of Willingboro, who met
Ushry at the Berlin club.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are not aware there's such a thing as a
Scrabble club,'' said Novack. ''I would have joined 20 years ago if
I had known it was in existence.''
</P>
<P>
   When the players - usually 10 to a dozen - arrive at Ushry's
home, they set up their boards and tile racks, as well as the
all-important Sam's Timer, which works in a similar fashion to a
chess clock, allotting 25 minutes per game per player.
</P>
<P>
   The clock allows for strategy - and keeps the game moving as
well. ''For each minute you're over on the clock, 10 points come
off your score,'' said Ushry. And as anyone who has ever played
Scrabble knows, every point counts - and even more so if they're on
a double or triple score space.
</P>
<P>
   Players are rated according to their abilities, and game
assignments are predicated on those ratings, said Ushry. Players
pay $1.50 per weekly session, to help defray the cost of the snacks
and beverages that are served. And that sustenance is important -
the gathering starts at 6 and isn't over until midnight.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is repeated throughout the United States and Canada,
said Yvonne Gillispie, marketing and projects director of the NSA,
which is based in Greenport, N.Y. There are more than 200 clubs in
the United States, she said, and the NSA also sanctions 175
tournaments yearly, which serve to help players get rated.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a game that couldn't even find a manufacturer when
it was created in 1948 by Alfred Mosher Butts, an unemployed
architect. Butts painstakingly scanned the front page of the New
York Tines, trying to calculate the frequency with which certain
letters appeared (the breakdown resulted in the number of tiles per
letter in the game - 12 E's, one Q, two C's, etc. - which remains
the same today).
</P>
<P>
   He teamed up with entrepreneur James Brunot, and together they
self-manufactured the game in an old Connecticut farmhouse where,
with the help of friends, they could produce 12 games an hour.
Still, Scrabble failed to catch on, and the men continued to lose
money until the president of Macy's discovered it while on vacation
and ordered a shipment for the Manhattan store. And the rest is
board game history.
</P>
<P>
   Because of mergers and acquisitions, Scrabble has had several
manufacturers over the years, the latest being Hasbro. But its
popularity has never waned, said Gillispie.
</P>
<P>
   ''Scrabble is very easy to play, and people can get better at
it,'' she said. ''You can move letters (on the tile rack) around
and make something out of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The local players work at the game. Novack studies her copy of
Merriam-Webster's Official Scrabble Players Dictionary at least 30
minutes a day and has made a recording of words that she plays
while she goes to sleep each night. Ushry has memorized all the
acceptable two- and three-letter words, and now is learning the
list of those with four letters.
</P>
<P>
   Scrabble has become so much a part of Novack's life that she and
a friend have a travel version of the game they play while dining
at restaurants. And Ushry and other club members rang in the dawn
of 2000 by playing Scrabble. When the power went out at the house
where they were, they lighted candles - and kept playing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an addiction,'' said Ushry. ''But it's really not bad.''
</P>
<P>
   For more information, Yolanda Ushry can be reached by calling
(800) 400-4411.

<HEADLINE> Cornell will lead science effort for NASA's 2003 Mars mission  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ITHACA, N.Y. (AP) - Cornell University astronomers Jim Bell and
Steven Squyres knew they had the right tools for the job. They just
needed a ride getting to work.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, NASA offered the lift Bell and Squyres were looking
for as they were included among an international team of scientists
who will spearhead the science effort on NASA's next rover mission
to Mars in mid-2003.
</P>
<P>
   Squyres will lead the scientific mission, which will feature a
rover the size of a small go-cart. The Athena rover will use the
tools Squyres' team developed three years ago for a 1998 mission
that was canceled. The team was again selected in 1999 for a
proposed 2001 mission that never materialized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had these tools literally sitting around. Now we'll be able
to use them,'' Squyres said.
</P>
<P>
   Athena's tools will include spectrometers, microscopes, and a
tool that can scrape away surface rock to study fresh or unexposed
rock. Athena, weighing about 250 pounds, will be considerably
larger than the Sojourner rover that NASA used in 1997, and will
have greater roaming range. The mission will follow up on a recent
discovery by the Mars Global Surveyor that water may have once
existed on the Red Planet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Really, we're looking for evidence of the presence of water,
and by extension, the presence of life,'' said Bell. He will be
responsible for the Pancam, a pair of robotic eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rover will have 20/20 vision, but also see in the infrared
and ultraviolet ranges of the light spectrum. It will be
spectacular,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Squyres' team was selected over a competing proposal from
aeronautics giant Lockheed Martin for an orbiting surveyor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Athena ... will be like having a robotic field geologist on
Mars,'' said Scott Hubbard, Mars Program Director at NASA.
</P>
<P>
   The Athena mission will help put Mars exploration back in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ability of the mission to connect with the public was one
of the criteria in the selection process,'' said NASA spokesman
Donald Savage.
</P>
<P>
   NASA's last huge success, the Mars Pathfinder and its Sojourner
rover provided both good science and great public relations.
</P>
<P>
   What followed were two heartbreaking failures in quick
succession: The $125 million dollar Mars Climate Orbiter burned up
in the Martian atmosphere last September after a botched conversion
of measurements from English to metric units. The Mars Polar Lander
mission failed to phone home in January.

<HEADLINE> Albright, N.Korean Minister Meet  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW PENNINGTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Fifty years after the Korean War,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on Friday used the United
States' first high-level talks with North Korea to detail concerns
over the communist state's missile program.
</P>
<P>
   The talks were a ''substantively modest but symbolically
historic step away from the sterility and hostility of the past,''
she said. The meeting ran nearly an hour over the allotted 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she was ''direct'' in letting North Korean Foreign
Minister Paek Nam Sun know of U.S. concerns over missile threats
and nuclear-related activity on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   Paek provided no details about a reported offer North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il made recently to Russia's president to transform
the North's missile program into peaceful efforts to launch
satellites into space, she said.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's ominous missile program was a major topic at an
Asian security forum this week.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kim Jong Il reaffirmed a moratorium on long-range
missile launches last month, a shot over Japan in 1998 wakened the
world to North Korea's growing prowess with such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The launch fueled the United States' drive to erect a national
missile defense, which most countries -- including its allies -- fear
will disrupt existing arms treaties.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have suggested letting North Korea launch
satellites from neutral nations but not permitting technology that
might improve their missiles.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand's foreign minister said Paek denied that North Korea
had nuclear weapons but acknowledged having missile systems.
</P>
<P>
   ''His response was also that this must be expected from North
Korea given the fact that other countries also have missiles
trained on his country,'' Foreign Minister Phil Goff said.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand was among countries engaged in a flurry of talks
with Paek, whose country has enjoyed a coming-out into the wider
world since the historic summit in June between the two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Goff announced that New Zealand would join Australia,
Italy and the Philippines in normalizing ties with the communist
state. Canada announced Thursday that it would establish diplomatic
ties.
</P>
<P>
   Athletes from the two Koreas may even march together at the
opening ceremony of the Olympic Games in Sydney. The International
Olympic Committee on Friday approved the North's proposal to let
the Koreans march together under the Olympic flag in what would be
a powerful symbol of Koreans' desire to reunify.
</P>
<P>
   Albright welcomed the thaw in relations, saying it served the
aspirations of both Koreas, which have yet to formalize a peace
since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made it very clear that it was very important to get past
the 50 years of hostility and look toward the future,'' Albright
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean peninsula has long been one of the world's
flashpoints. Some 37,000 U.S. troops remain posted in South Korea,
which is divided from the North by the world's most heavily
militarized border.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said she was ''somewhat more hopeful than before for
the long-term stability on the Korean peninsula and throughout the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea issued a statement saying the two sides conducted
''serious deliberations on the ways to normalize and expand''
relations and agreed that recent developments had led to a
''positive atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting's start, Albright reached across a table to shake
hands with Paek three times for the cameras, and later describing
Paek as ''very nice.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he had passed me last year at the General Assembly and
we had not spoken to each other,'' the former U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations said. ''He did, however, tell me I looked
younger this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright wore a canary yellow dress similar to the ''sunshine
dress'' she wore on her last trip to Asia to pay tribute to South
Korean President Kim Dae-jung's so-called ''sunshine policy'' of
building peace with the North.
</P>
<P>
   Tied up in Washington with the Mideast peace summit, she nearly
lost the chance to meet Paek, having missed North Korea's induction
Thursday into the 23-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations
Regional Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about news reports that North Korea would dispatch a
high-level delegation to Washington to discuss improving ties, Paek
said the Americans have been seeking such an encounter but ''the
atmosphere is not ripe yet.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea first wants the United States to end economic
sanctions and remove it from the list of countries that sponsor
terrorism.

<HEADLINE> Last N. Ireland Prisoners Freed  </HEADLINE>
By KRISTIN GAZLAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   LISBURN, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The final convicted terrorists
freed as part of Northern Ireland's compromise for peace strode out
the prison gates Friday, some expressing ''true remorse'' for their
victims and others declaring themselves ''unbowed and unbroken.''
</P>
<P>
   The 86 inmates -- among them some of the province's most
notorious bombers and mass murderers -- were greeted by their
paramilitary comrades with champagne and confetti, cheers and
chants, and lots of partisan flag-waving.
</P>
<P>
   Their release brought to 428 the number of prisoners granted
early paroles in one of the most bitterly opposed provisions of the
province's 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our hope that we will prove to be the last generation
forced to war in defense of our community,'' the newly freed
members of the Ulster Freedom Fighters said in a joint statement
read outside the creaking exit turnstiles of the anti-terrorist
Maze prison near Lisburn, southwest of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   The statement added that members of the banned pro-British
paramilitary group offered their ''abject and true remorse to the
innocent victims of this conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim McVeigh, the Irish Republican Army's leader in the Maze and
the only prisoner to address reporters, described the 48 IRA
inmates released Friday as ''unbowed and unbroken.''
</P>
<P>
   McVeigh added, however, that members of the outlawed group
''offer the sincere hand of friendship to everyone who is prepared
to help build a new future for all of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   The early paroles started mere months after the striking of the
peace agreement in April 1998, granted to eligible prisoners
affiliated with paramilitary groups observing cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   Among those released Friday were Sean Kelly, part of an Irish
Republican Army team that killed nine Protestants at a fish shop in
1993, and Torrens Knight, a member of the Ulster Freedom Fighters
squad that took the lives of seven people one week later in
retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Freed, too, was James McArdle, the IRA man who planted a bomb in
London's Docklands in 1996, killing two people and injuring 40.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fully recognize this to be a difficult and bitter pill for
many people to swallow,'' Peter Mandelson, Britain's senior
official in Northern Ireland, said in a British Broadcasting Corp.
radio interview.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that it was essential that ''we bring these
paramilitary prisoners back into the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Those words did nothing to placate William Frazer, who held a
lonely protest outside the rusting prison gates.
</P>
<P>
   Frazer, whose father was gunned down by the IRA in the group's
stronghold of south Armagh, has founded the group Families Acting
for Innocent Relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Along with a number of Protestant politicians, he noted that the
paramilitary groups were benefiting from the release provision
without turning over their weaponry as stipulated in the peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of us could better swallow this bitter pill if these
people had turned their guns in at the same time,'' Frazer said, as
he posted pictures of released IRA prisoners carrying the tags
''Still Wanted for Murder'' and ''The Face of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   At the height of ''the Troubles,'' the Maze compound housed
1,700 men. Friday's mass release cut the number to just 16 inmates,
who -- vastly outnumbered by guards -- eventually will be transferred
to one of Northern Ireland's other two prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the inmates released Friday walked out of those two
prisons, with the remaining 78 released from the Maze.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the groups whose members were freed Friday made note
of the Maze's starring role in the province's 30 years of sectarian
strife.
</P>
<P>
   The Ulster Freedom Fighters referred to themselves as
''prisoners of war in this sojourn place.'' And McVeigh paid
tribute to the 1981 Maze hunger strike that led to the deaths of
Bobby Sands and nine IRA comrades, kicking off violent street
protests and eventual change across Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The hunger strike also helped lead to changes in the Maze: By
the early 1990s, prison cells were unlocked 24 hours a day and the
various paramilitary groups ran their segregated wings with near
autonomy, with guards needing to provide a day's notice to carry
out any inspections.
</P>
<P>
   When the last inmates are transferred out, the Maze will be kept
readied for contingency purposes. But the British government
eventually must decide what to do with the sprawling facility.
</P>
<P>
   Among those advocating turning it into a museum is Kieran
McEvoy, assistant director of the Institute of Criminology at
Belfast's Queen's University.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is one of the most important historical sites of the
conflict,'' McEvoy said. ''It would be a shame to bulldoze away an
uncomfortable or unhappy past.
</P>
<P>
   ''In South Africa and other parts of the world, there are
examples of prisons becoming symbols of peace and reconciliation
after the mistakes of the past.''

<HEADLINE> Cayugas get chance to tell their side in land claim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Through weeks and weeks of testimony,
expert witnesses - appraisers, economists and historians - have had
all the say in the Cayuga Indian Nation land claim trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Cayugas got the chance to speak for themselves
and describe how the loss of their ancestral lands two centuries
ago has had a lasting impact on the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Clint Halftown and Bernadette Hill began their turn on the
witness stand as the second week of the second phase of the damages
trial in U.S. District Court came to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Following a month-long trial, a federal court jury in February
awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million in damages for the loss of 64,027
acres in Cayuga and Seneca counties. Judge Neal McCurn ruled in
1994 that New York illegally acquired the land in 1795 and 1807 by
purchasing it from the Cayugas without the federal government's
required approval.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn is now weighing historical and economic factors to decide
whether the jury's award should be increased.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first trial and the first part of the second trial,
the Cayugas have had to remain silent. Halftown and Hill have sat
in the courtroom and watched nearly all of the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard to listen to some of the testimony about how the
Cayugas were treated,'' said Halftown, a leader and spokesman for
the Cayugas. ''It's pretty depressing, but it's a story that has to
be told.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm looking forward to telling the judge about the impact the
loss of our land has had on our people,'' Halftown said.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said much of the Cayugas' history is oral, handed down by
word-of-mouth from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't hear what happened to our people in this much
detail. I just want to tell our side of the story,'' said Hill, a
clan mother.
</P>
<P>
   Both said the expert historical witnesses so far have done an
excellent job detailing how the state treated the Cayugas before
and after it acquired their 64,000-acre reservation in 1795 and
1807.
</P>
<P>
   They said they hoped their testimony over the next several days
will bolster the experts' testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Hill said she would recount her family history and describe how
the lack of a homeland has affected her life, her family and the
nation. She said she would also describe a ''succession of broken
promises'' made by the state to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Halftown's testimony was to focus on the present makeup of the
nation and its people. He said he would describe hardships
affecting the nation as it strives to maintain its people, its
culture and traditions without a homeland, language or money.
</P>
<P>
   Both also said they would testify about the impossibility of
filing the current lawsuit earlier than November 1980, countering
state claims that the nation waited too long.

</P>
<P>
   The actor and director speared the halibut, but it was so strong
it needed to be speared again.

<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- Journalist and author Hunter S. Thompson
slightly wounded his female assistant when he fired a shotgun to
chase a bear off his Colorado property.
</P>
<P>
   Pitkin County District Attorney Mac Myers confirmed there was an
incident on Thompson's property near Aspen on Thursday. Division of
Wildlife spokesman Pat Tucker said one of his officers was told by
the sheriff's office that a bear had been reported near Thompson's

<P>
   Thompson, usually the focus of his reporting on subjects ranging
from the Vietnam War to presidential politics to the Super Bowl,
has lived in the Woody Creek area near Aspen for decades and owns
several firearms.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Testing -- but no restart yet -- at nuclear reactor  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHANAN, N.Y. (AP) - Con Edison began testing the Indian Point
2 nuclear power plant Friday, building up heat and pressure to
check for leaks or other problems in advance of restarting the
controversial reactor.
</P>
<P>
   The tests are considered routine for a nuclear plant coming back
from an outage, but Con Ed still doesn't have permission for a full
restart. Just a few hundred feet from the plant, company executives
met for hours Friday with representatives of the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, trying to satisfy their safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The reactor has been off line since a leak in February that
emitted a tiny amount of radioactive steam and brought public
attention to the plant's aging steam generators, which have been in
use since the plant started up in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and local officials have demanded that new generators
be installed before any restart. Con Ed says the plant is safe now
and wants to restart in time to help feed summertime power demands.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the NRC expressed dissatisfaction with the utility's
readiness and demanded more information about the dependability of
the thousands of steam generator tubes like the one that leaked in
February. Friday's meeting was called to exchange ideas about that
new information.
</P>
<P>
   No decision on a restart would be announced Friday, said NRC
spokesman Neil Sheehan. He said the utility had permission only for
the tests, which Sheehan said would run through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Testing became possible when the NRC amended the reactor's
technical specifications on Thursday, dropping the need for certain
filters and absorbers. The amendments were due to new estimates of
public radiation doses from reactor accidents, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They gave us the allowances, and we're able to increase heat
and pressure to perform additional tests,'' said Con Ed spokesman
Joseph Petta.
</P>
<P>
   ''They clearly do not have our permission to restart at this
point,'' Sheehan said. ''This is just to allow them to check for
leakage, to see how some components will hold up under increased
pressure and temperature. It's the typical sort of testing for any
nuclear power plant pondering coming back on line.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the NRC said Con Ed's last inspection of the Indian
Point 2 nuclear reactor was ''deficient in several respects'' that
may have contributed to the radioactive leak. The utility defended
itself, saying its 1997 inspection ''used the most sophisticated
technology and analysis available at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said Friday that the NRC's
finding means ''It is now time for Con Edison to stop charging its
customers for the utility's mismanagement of the plant.'' The
utility has had to buy electricity to replace what Indian Point 2
would have generated, and is passing on the cost, about $2 a month
for the average customer.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Con Ed should refund the millions it has already
collected. But Petta said Con Ed's efficient operation of Indian
Point 2 ''has saved customers more than $3 billion'' over the past
26 years.

<HEADLINE> Bardot Lauds Release of Black Bears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French actress and animal rights activist Brigitte
Bardot welcomed China's decision to release 500 endangered Asiatic
black bears from primitive farms.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities signed an agreement this week with a Hong
Kong-based animal welfare group to release the bears.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation praised the move,
but called on authorities to free the remaining 7,000 bears held in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Bardot's foundation condemned the practice by which bile is
extracted from the bears' gallbladders for use in traditional
Chinese medicine. Activists say the bile can be replaced by herbs
in Chinese medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Locked in narrow cages, the bears are tortured for their bile
which is extracted using metal catheters implanted in their
stomachs,'' the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Ten of 12 Westchester beaches reopened  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y. (AP) - Ten beaches in New Rochelle, closed
for a day because of a sewage overflow, were reopened Friday, the
Health Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Two beaches in Larchmont remained closed, however.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 beaches were closed Thursday after heavy rains
overwhelmed two pump stations in Larchmont and sewage was
discharged into Long Island Sound, chlorinated but not otherwise
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Department spokeswoman Mary Landrigan said there was no public
health threat. The closings were a precaution and the two in
Larchmont - at Larchmont Manor Park and the Larchmont Shore Club -
remained closed because they were closest to the pump stations.
</P>
<P>
   The Health Department expected to reopen them Saturday,
Landrigan said.

<HEADLINE> Trial testimony wins early release for two drug dealers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Two convicted drug dealers who testified for
federal prosecutors in the trial of kingpins Jose ''J.R.'' Rivera
and Luis ''Tun Tun'' Figueroa were released from prison Thursday in
return for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas Torres and Camildo Cruz were among 14 people, including
Rivera and Figueroa, charged in 1998 with drug conspiracy. Torres
and Cruz, who already were serving time for their part in a drug
operation and could have faced additional prison terms for the new
charges, instead became star witnesses in the case.
</P>
<P>
   They were released after a hearing before Judge Frank Lario in
Superior Court in Camden County.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the request of the federal government, for their
cooperation in the case against J.R. Rivera, the sentence was
reduced,'' Deputy Attorney General John Corson said. ''The state
was satisfied that with the sentence imposed, justice was served.''
</P>
<P>
   During their testimony against their former associates, the men
also implicated Camden Mayor Milton Milan, saying he had purchased
cocaine from the drug cartel that was broken up by federal
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Milan, who is accused in a federal indictment of extortion,
money laundering and mail fraud, has denied that allegation.
</P>
<P>
   ''These people made deals and said what they were offered and
what they needed to say. That case went in favor of the government
and they were rewarded,'' he told The Associated Press on Friday.
''It doesn't mean things they were saying are true.''
</P>
<P>
   Torres, 31, was sentenced Thursday to 25 years in prison for his
role in a narcotics ring called 33rd Street Set, then had the
sentence suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz, 34, who had been sentenced to 13 years in prison for his
role in the same organization, also had his sentence suspended.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Down 145; Dow Drops 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fell sharply Friday, led by technology
shares, after another new report that revealed surprising strength
in the economy and suggested that inflationary pressures may not be
easing after all.
</P>
<P>
   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was down 77.79 at 10,508.34 after giving back an early
62-point gain.
</P>
<P>
   The technology-driven Nasdaq composite index was down 145.30 at
3,696.93, extending Thursday's 145-point slide.
</P>
<P>
   Among other broad-market indicators, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
was down 27.01 at 1,422.61, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies was down 10.41 at 491.20.
</P>
<P>
   Before trading began, the Commerce Department reported that the
U.S. economy grew at a robust annual rate of 5.2 percent in the
spring as a surge in investment by American businesses offset a
slowdown in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   However, an inflation gauge tied to the report and favored by
Federal Reserve officials showed that prices rose at an annual rate
of just 2.3 percent in the second quarter, down from a first
quarter rate of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the unexpected acceleration in activity during the
second quarter came as a surprise to economists, compounding
concerns raised on Thursday by reports showing large increases in
employment costs and big-ticket factory orders.
</P>
<P>
   Unless mitigated by signs of slowing before the next Fed meeting
on Aug. 22, the latest economic readings may force the central bank
to boost interest rates again in a bid to slow the economy and
contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Network equipment makers were prominent among the day's big
decliners with Cisco Systems falling $4.25 to $63.75 as the most
active Nasdaq issue.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, JDS Uniphase slid $9.50 to $119.125 amid news that
Royal Philips Electronics had sold 5 million of its JDS shares. And
Nortel Networks fell $5.063 to $73.063 after announcing a $7.8
billion acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks helped lead the Dow lower amid the renewed
concerns about interest rates, which could hurt demand for loans.
American Express was down $2.875 at $55.438 and J.P. Morgan was
down $2.188 at $130 as the Dow's two weakest components after
Intel, down $4.25 at $132.75.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about a 2-to-1 margin
on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE volume totaled just 783.62 million shares, down from 912.17
million at the same point on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.12 percent,
Germany's DAX index fell 0.77 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell
0.26 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.47 percent.

<HEADLINE> City Embraces Bach's Legacy  </HEADLINE>
By BURT HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- Johann Sebastian Bach and his adopted city of
Leipzig squabbled during his lifetime, and it took generations for
his exquisite compositions to get the recognition they deserved.
</P>
<P>
   Now, during events marking the anniversary of his death 250
years ago Friday, the city is seeking to reinvent itself as a place
of pilgrimage for Bach lovers.
</P>
<P>
   The yearlong celebration climaxes with a gala concert Friday
night in St. Thomas Church, where Bach was cantor for the last 27
years of his life.
</P>
<P>
   City officials -- whose forebears argued with Bach over such
duties as having to teach Latin -- have even produced something of a
belated gift to the composer: a new $1.25 million organ with 4,500
pipes made from pewter, lead and wood that was to debut at the
concert.
</P>
<P>
   ''After more than 250 years, the moving power and the depth of
expression of Bach's music has lost nothing, rather gained,'' Bach
historian Christoph Wolff of Harvard University said Friday at a
ceremony in the church attended by 1,400 people.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bach festivals have been held in Leipzig before, this
year's is only the second that the city has sponsored, and is just
the beginning of what officials plan to make an annual tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to underscore for the rest of the world the meaning of
Leipzig as Bach's city,'' said Joachim Deggerich of the city's
cultural office.
</P>
<P>
   Since the fall of communism in 1989, the eastern city of Leipzig
has worried more about revamping its economy and regaining its
position as a trading center than promoting culture. Now the two
are seen as complementary.
</P>
<P>
   ''After 1989 there were plenty of problems with business,'' said
Joerg Clemen of the Bach Archive. ''Now, residents realize they
need Bach. Bach belongs to Leipzig and Leipzig belongs to Bach.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the archive is working with IBM to make all of
Bach's original handwritten documents available on the Web. Many
have fallen into decay because the greatness of Bach's music wasn't
recognized until long after his death so they weren't properly
preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Coinciding with the anniversary concert Friday of Bach's ''Mass
in B-Minor,'' the archive's Web site will allow computer users to
view the composer's actual score for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   That concert is part of a 24-hour event, parts of which were to
be aired in 40 countries with an expected 100 million viewers.
Classical giants such as John Eliot Gardiner and Ton Koopman were
participating with six orchestras, seven ensembles, three choirs
and 40 soloists. One-third of the music will be staged at other
points around the world, including a Tokyo performance of the
''Johannes Passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Other modern touches include an open-air presentation titled
''Swinging Bach'' featuring Bobby McFerrin.
</P>
<P>
   Born into a family of musicians on March 21, 1685 in Eisenach,
Bach gained acclaim as an accomplished organist in cities around
present-day Germany.
</P>
<P>
   His complex compositions in counterpoint, weaving multiple
melodies together to form a united whole, are considered the
standard of the form and have yet to be surpassed in their
elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Bach began his official duties as cantor in Leipzig on May 30,
1723. He died in 1750, at age 65, after a failed eye operation.

<HEADLINE> Concorde Victims Mourned in France  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA DOLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   GONESSE, France (AP) -- Still in shock over the Concorde crash in
their town, more than 1,000 residents of Gonesse and nearby cities
held a silent procession Friday to honor the 114 victims of the
disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Among the marchers was Michele Fricheteau, the owner of the
Hotelissimo that was destroyed in the crash. Her face was covered
with angry red burns, and her arms were wrapped in white bandages.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to pay homage to the people who are dead, those who
worked for me,'' Fricheteau said. She and the hotel employees, many
of whom had tears in their eyes, were the first to lay flowers near
the crash site.
</P>
<P>
   Less than three miles away, Air France held its own memorial in
a tree-lined courtyard of the airline's headquarters, where pilots
and other crew wept as they heard tributes to their dead
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each one of us was touched,'' one pilot, Capt. Gerard Feldzer,
told reporters after the service near Charles de Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   The bustling airport, best known as the gateway for millions of
carefree visitors to Paris, was the starting point for the doomed
flight. Shortly after takeoff Tuesday, the Concorde plunged to
earth, slamming into the Hotelissimo in Gonesse.
</P>
<P>
   The Air France memorial drew hundreds of pilots, flight
attendants and other airline personnel to hear plaintive Muslim and
Christian songs dedicated to the nine crew members killed in the
crash.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Cyril Spinetta, president of Air France, spoke of ''the
same emotion, the same compassion, the same infinite sadness''
uniting company staff, ''touching us -- both flyers and the
personnel on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   The first names of each of the dead were read individually like
a solemn dirge: ''Jean, Marie ...'' The service was punctuated
periodically by the roar of jets on a nearby runway.
</P>
<P>
   As the mourners in their navy blue Air France uniforms left the
service, their grief was visible. Many women sobbed and one woman
collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   In the winding streets of Gonesse, citizens carried white
flowers in a silent procession to pay tribute to the victims. They
laid wreaths next to a police barrier blocking access to the crash
scene.
</P>
<P>
   Before the hour-long procession, some expressed relief that more
townspeople had not been killed in the disaster. A sense of outrage
has also been simmering in Gonesse and nearby towns -- fueled by a
long-standing feud over the nearby airport and its increased
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Residents have been fighting plans to build a fourth runway at
Charles de Gaulle and have called for construction of a third Paris
airport to alleviate the noise and traffic at each existing
airport. Now, a new sense of danger has crept into their concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can never forget that catastrophes can happen nearby
airports,'' said Gonesse Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy before the
procession departed.

<HEADLINE> Truck hits house after clipping bus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHELLE PARK, N.J. (AP) - A tractor-trailer careened into a
house Friday after passing a stop sign and clipping an NJ Transit
commuter bus, police said.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries were reported, and the house remains
habitable, Capt. Robert Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Truck driver Thomas Birkner of Lincoln Park told police its
brakes failed, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Police await the results of an inspection and issued no summons,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident happened about 6:15 a.m. as the truck was leaving
Route 17, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The bus was traveling east on Passaic Street carrying three
passengers on the 163 run from Ridgewood to the Port Authority
terminal in New York, NJ Transit spokesman Michael Klufas said.
</P>
<P>
   It spun around after being struck on the right rear by the
truck, and suffered a broken axle and other damage, Klufas said.
</P>
<P>
   One passenger and Birkner, driving for Hanks Trucking, of
Middletown, refused medical attention, Davidson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bus driver Gaeton Dinapoli, of Hackensack, and two passengers
were treated at Hackensack University Medical Center for minor
injuries, he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has Time to Answer Complaint  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS LEHOURITES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- A judge on Friday gave President
Clinton an extra four weeks to answer a state disciplinary panel's
request that he lose his Arkansas law license.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's lawyers now have until Aug. 29 to answer the state's
complaint that the president gave misleading testimony during the
Paula Jones sexual harassment case and is no longer fit to be a
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The president's response had been due Aug. 1. The state's
prosecutor said she didn't object to the delay, so long as the
proceedings can be wrapped up by the end of the year, when the
judge hearing the case leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers filed Tuesday, Clinton said that his
presidential duties prevented him from preparing a response to a
complaint filed by the state Supreme Court's Committee on
Professional Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton shepherded Middle East peace talks at Thurmont, Md., for
much of the last three weeks and also traveled to Tokyo for a
meeting of world leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The conduct committee sued Clinton on June 30, saying the
president should be disbarred for lying under oath about his
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Complaints from the Southeastern Legal Foundation of Atlanta and
the federal judge in the Jones case led to the recommendation. The
judge found Clinton in contempt of court and referred the case to
the conduct committee.

<HEADLINE> Tour operator told to improve engines on half of double-decker fleet </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - A federal judge on Friday ruled that a plea
bargain by one of New York City's biggest tour bus operators
requires it to use engines that can be certified as meeting
pollution standards.
</P>
<P>
   That means New York Apple Tours Inc. may need to improve or
replace about half the engines in its double-decker fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The impact on Apple Tours operations could not be immediately
assessed, but the buses would continue operating, its president
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the company, which has New Jersey owners and was
formerly based in Fort Lee, N.J., faces continuing efforts by New
York authorities to shut it down.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling by U.S. District Judge John W. Bissell came as he
ordered Apple Tours to pay the expected $800,000 fine and placed it
on probation for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Company president Hayim Grant of Alpine attended the hearing but
left without speaking to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Reached later by telephone, he said, ''I have to review the
requirements with the proper agencies, and understand with
engineers what it is we have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant also issued a written statement saying the ruling did not
reflect the company's ''significant efforts at reducing diesel
emission levels,'' but that it would ''fully comply.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We operate the cleanest fleet of English double-decker buses
in New York, and we will continue to imporove the fleet's emissions
levels to enhance our city,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant and his father, Harry Grant, guaranteed the payments of
the fine, which is due in installments into 2006.
</P>
<P>
   The company negotiated the sum with federal prosecutors before
pleading guilty in September to charges it lied about the age of 70
imported vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The deception allowed the company to get them on the street
quicker by avoiding attention from transit and environmental
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Tours came under renewed scrutiny on May 22, when one of
its buses struck and killed a 71-year-old actor, Randolph Walker,
in Manhattan. New York city and state shut the company down, citing
hundreds of violations and unqualified drivers.
</P>
<P>
   New York state judges allowed the buses to resume trips, ruling
that 63 bus registrations and tour licenses were pulled without
proper hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Bissell said his ruling on Friday was to resolve an
''ambiguity'' in the plea bargain and was not influenced by events
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying I'm putting blinders on, but I'm focusing on
the offense here,'' Bissell said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plea bargain, Apple Tours agreed to have its buses
inspected and certified to meet federal emissions standards.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Tours maintained the deal allowed it to use engines that
are 20 years and older, which are exempt from Clean Air Act
standards. Such engines were installed in more than 30 buses, Apple
Tours lawyer Walter F. Timpone said.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining buses were already in compliance or being used for
parts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, however, agreed with Assistant U.S. Attorney Lorraine
S. Gerson, who argued the plea deal required engines certified by
the Environmental Protection Agency, not exempt engines.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, Timpone said he did not know how much it
would cost to upgrade or replace the engines since he did not know
what year's standard the EPA would require.
</P>
<P>
   He said the engines now surpass 1990 standards and are close to
meeting 1993 figures.
</P>
<P>
   Timpone also said the buses have repeatedly passed New York
State safety inspections.
</P>
<P>
   EPA spokeswoman Mary Mears said the engines have to meet the
standard of the year in which they were imported. She said the
ruling ''has a more positive environmental impact'' than allowing
exempt engines.
</P>
<P>
   The English- and German-made buses were imported from London's
transit system from 1991 through 1995, according to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   By saying the buses were older than 25, the company avoided a
time-consuming inspection by the U.S. Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   DOT regulations exempt buses that are 25 or older from
conforming with federal motor-vehicle safety standards.
</P>

   Apple Tours imported younger buses but falsified documents to
the DOT, EPA and Customs Service to make it appear they were
manufactured in 1967, it admitted in September in pleading guilty
to two charges of creating and submitting false documents.

<P>
   When government agencies began investigating, Apple Tours
attempted to conceal its fraud by creating bogus documents that
supported its contention that the buses were made in 1967, the
company admitted.

<HEADLINE> Pataki administration attacks McCall over landslide bids  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Pataki administration on Friday
criticized state Comptroller H. Carl McCall for refusing to approve
a more expensive but faster recovery plan for a May mudslide near
Albany.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Transportation said the decision by
McCall's office would prolong problems faced by residents and
businesses of suburban Bethlehem since the May 16 slide along the
rain-swelled Normanskill Creek.
</P>
<P>
   In an angry statement, McCall countered that DOT ''made the
mistake'' of not awarding the contract to the lowest bidder, as
mandated by state law, and ''blames someone else for their own
foul-up.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, DOT accepted bids on a long-term contract to
re-route the Normanskill and Albany's water line and restore four
lanes of traffic on the main roadway linking the city and
Bethlehem. The department selected August Bohl Contracting Co. at a
cost of $9.85 million and a projected completion date of Oct. 26,
spokesman Michael Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   That changed late Thursday, Fleischer said, when McCall's office
told DOT that it would not process required paperwork for the
contract because another contractor, James H. Maloy Inc., had
submitted a lower bid of $9.3 million. Maloy's scheduled completion
date was Nov. 12.
</P>
<P>
   DOT decided to go with the lower-priced bidder after it became
apparent that the comptroller's office wouldn't budge, according to
Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said DOT initially chose August Bohl Contracting over
James H. Maloy Inc. because ''it's critically important to get this
landslide fixed as quickly as possible for the businesses and the
residents here.''
</P>
<P>
   ''They were both capable contractors, but one contractor gave us
a more aggressive schedule. Speed is of paramount importance,''
Fleischer said. ''We think two and a half weeks is certainly
justified by spending the extra money.
</P>
<P>
   Under an ''emergency situation,'' Fleischer said the department
could make the decision that's ''in the best interest of the
state'' rather than basing it on the bidding price.
</P>
<P>
   He added that DOT based its decision on speed because the
federal government had agreed to fully reimburse for all work
completed before Nov. 12. August Bohl Contracting's earlier
projected completion date would have allowed a grace period of 17
days.
</P>
<P>
   With James H. Maloy Inc.'s schedule, ''there's no room for
slippage,'' he said. Factors such as foul weather or delay in
supply transportation could all mean pushing back the completion
date. If that happens, the state will have to pay for some of the
work because federal reimbursement after the Nov. 12 deadline would
be 80 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We slip one day, we lose money,'' he said. ''It could be
hundreds of thousands, maybe millions (of dollars).''
</P>
<P>
   McCall said his office did not receive any information on the
Bethlehem landslide reconstruction. It only contacted DOT after
finding out about the plan to go with August Bohl Contracting ''to
try and help them untangle the mess DOT had created,'' he said
</P>
<P>
   ''In an attempt to help DOT avoid legal action against them by
the lowest bidder, we gave DOT several options,'' McCall said.
''Unfortunately, DOT has created its own option: blame someone else
and hope no one notices.''
</P>
<P>
   McCall, a Democrat, is considering a run for governor in 2002.
In recent months he has attacked several actions of the Republican
Pataki administration. George Pataki, meanwhile, has said he may be
seeking a third-term as governor come 2002.

<HEADLINE> Breast Cancer Stamp Extended  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fund-raising breast cancer postage stamp
will remain on sale for two more years.
</P>
<P>
   Sale of the stamp was scheduled to have ended at midnight
Saturday, but President Clinton signed legislation extending the
stamp's lifetime, the Postal Service announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed legislation in 1977 that directed the post
office to issue the special stamp, called a semipostal, to raise
money for breast cancer research. The stamp sells for 40 cents,
seven cents more than the first class mail rate of 33 cents, with
the overage given to research.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about 215 million of the stamps have been sold, raising
$15.1 million for research at the National Institutes of Health and
the Defense Department.
</P>
<P>
   Semipostal stamps have been used in other countries with mixed
success, and the post office had been reluctant to issue one. It
preferred not to have to choose among various charities and causes
seeking funds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, faced with a dozen or so proposals for semipostal stamps
for other charities, Congress is considering a measure that would
authorize the post office to issue more such stamps and give it the
responsibility for picking the topics.

<HEADLINE> Woman locked in bank vault dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP)- A woman accidentally locked inside a basement
vault of a bank in Lower Manhattan suffocated after a freak
confluence of events sucked all the air out of the enclosed room.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Penn, 35, was putting the day's stock receipts away at
the Employee Depository and Clearing House Thursday night when she
was accidentally locked inside, Detective Carolyn Chew, a police
spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn pulled the fire alarm at around 9 p.m. thinking it would
summon help, but instead it triggered a carbon-dioxide-gas-fire
extinguishing system, which sucked the air from the vault, Chew
said.
</P>
<P>
   She was finally removed from the vault at 10:17 p.m. and rushed
to Beekman Hospital in extremely critical condition, Chew said. She
died a short time later.

<HEADLINE> Doomed Concorde's Tire Blew Out  </HEADLINE>
By CLAR NI CHONGHAILE
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- A tire blew out as the doomed Air France Concorde
roared down the runway, France's Transport Ministry said Friday,
leading to speculation that debris from the blowout may have
triggered a fire in one of the plane's engines.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry statement was the first time a tire blowout has
been confirmed and investigators were trying to determine what role
it played in sending the luxury jet plunging into a hotel in the
town of Gonesse minutes after takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, another body was found in the charred rubble of the
Hotelissimo, bringing the death toll to 114. Most of the 100
passengers were German tourists about to start the trip of a
lifetime -- flying the Concorde to New York, followed by a Caribbean
cruise. Nine Air France crew members and five people in the hotel
also died.
</P>
<P>
   Blown out tires have been blamed for past brushes with
near-disaster, despite Concorde's seemingly spotless safety record.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board reported
four ''potentially catastrophic'' incidents resulting from blown
out tires during Concorde takeoffs between June 1979 and February
1981.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious occurred in June 1979 at Dulles airport outside
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   As a Concorde was taking off, two tires on the main left landing
gear blew out and tire debris and wheel shrapnel damaged the No. 2
engine and punctured three fuel tanks. A large hole was torn in the
wing.
</P>
<P>
   The plane returned to the airport for an emergency landing with
fuel pouring from the wing. Design modifications were made after
the incident, along with an NTSB recommendation that landing gear
not be retracted if a blowout occurs and that any plane suffering a
blowout immediately return for an emergency landing at the airport
where it took off.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary report on Tuesday's Paris crash is due to be
released at the end of August, but just three days after the
tragedy, a sketchy picture of the sequence of events has emerged.
</P>
<P>
   ''At least one tire exploded, which could have triggered a chain
of events, structural damage, a fire and an engine breakdown,'' the
Transport Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
   An initial Transport Ministry report issued Thursday said tire
debris was found strewn along runway 26 where the Concorde took
off.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can surmise that a tire or several tires on the landing
gear exploded, that the debris from the tires got into the air duct
of one of the engines,'' aviation writer and former pilot Germain
Chambost told France's LCI television.
</P>
<P>
   He added that a piece of tire in the engine during takeoff could
cause ''serious damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators already know that engine No. 2 failed, that the
pilot could not draw up the undercarriage and that engine No. 1
lost power -- once on the runway, and again less than one minute
into the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot, who has grounded all Air
France Concorde flights, said Friday he wanted across-the-board
supplementary security procedures before allowing the supersonic
jets to take to the sky again.
</P>
<P>
   Air France said Friday its Concorde jets would remain grounded
until further notice.
</P>
<P>
   As a picture of what went wrong on flight AF4590 began to
crystallize, friends and colleagues of the nine crew members who
died in the crash attended a memorial service Friday at Air France
headquarters at the Charles de Gaulle airport.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers praised the professionalism of the late crew. Many
mourners bowed their heads and some cried quietly into their
handkerchiefs. One woman fainted.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very moving ceremony,'' said Gerard Feldzer, a pilot
for Air France. ''Each one of us was touched.''
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby town of Gonesse, where the jet crashed, residents
held a silent march Friday evening from City Hall toward the site
where the Concorde went down.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Jean-Pierre Blazy walked at the front with the owner of
the destroyed Hotelissimo, Michelle Fricheteau, whose arms were
wrapped in white bandages and whose face bore burn marks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still in shock. It's a time for reverent silence, pain
and emotion'', Blazy said.
</P>
<P>
   In Clinton Township, N.J., meanwhile, the sister of the sole
American victim, Christopher Behrens, said her brother was flying
to New York for an annual visit.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, 65, a retired Air France sales and promotions
executive, ''just worshipped the Concorde,'' Rachel Coats, 71, said
Friday. ''It's just so ironic that it took his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the technical inquiry, a French prosecutor is
investigating whether to bring criminal charges in connection with
the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Xavier Salvat, prosecutor for the Val d'Oise region where the
jet crashed, said he had taken the rare step of appointing three
investigative magistrates, rather than just one, because the
investigation promises to be complex.
</P>
<P>
   The accident, which ended Concorde's 31-year record of safe
flying, united France and Germany in sadness and provoked
speculation about the jetliner's future.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a quarter-century, Britain and France boasted of
the plane they jointly developed as a marvel ahead of its time. But
Concorde has never been a commercial success. Before the crash only
13 were operated -- seven by British Airways and six by Air France.

<HEADLINE> 4 Early Concorde Incidents Cited  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BRISCOE
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blown tires on the European-built Concorde
supersonic planes caused four ''potentially catastrophic''
incidents in the first two years of the luxury airliner's
commercial life, including one that damaged an engine, punctured
fuel tanks and left a large hole in the top of the wing.
</P>
<P>
   That mishap, on June 14, 1979, sounded eerily similar to what
authorities believe may have happened just before Tuesday's crash
outside Paris killing 114 people.
</P>
<P>
   The 1979 incident, and three less dangerous events involving the
Concorde over the next two years, resulted in adoption by Air
France of strict inspection and emergency procedures. No similar
failure has been repeated in two decades of operation before
Tuesday's crash outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
   French officials have not ruled out human error in the Concorde
crash and were also looking into the possibility of design or
construction flaws. On Friday, officials concluded that at least
one wheel had exploded, which could have damaged the plane's
structure, triggered a fire and caused one of the engines to fail.
</P>
<P>
   The first blowout in 1979 is not in the National Transportation
Safety Board's databank of airliner safety incidents, but it is
cited in a Nov. 9, 1981, NTSB safety recommendation which Air
France agreed to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tire debris and wheel shrapnel resulted in damage to the No. 2
engine, puncture of three fuel tanks, and severance of several
hydraulic lines and electrical wires,'' the board said in
describing the 1979 mishap. ''Additionally, a large hole was torn
in the top wing skin which covers the wheel well area.''
</P>
<P>
   That flight returned safely to Dulles International Airport near
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The four 1979-1981 incidents in NTSB records, all at New York or
Washington airports, resulted in changes in strict inspection and
emergency procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The second mishap cited by the board in its 1981 recommendation
was a blown tire five weeks later, on July 21, 1979, during takeoff
from Dulles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The similarity between the two incidents led to immediate
voluntary corrective action by the appropriate authorities,'' the
board said. This included an airworthiness directive by French
aviation authorities that required detailed inspection of each
wheel prior to takeoff and advice to crew members that when a
problem is suspected, ''particularly when a bang is heard,'' that
the landing gear should not be raised.
</P>
<P>
   But two subsequent incidents, more than a year apart, prompted
the further action, including a mild rebuke of Air France for the
ineffectiveness of its earlier directives.
</P>
<P>
   ''The repetitive nature of these incidents and, in particular,
crew response to the more recent incidents is of serious concern,''
said the U.S. board, whose recommendations normally are adopted by
foreign airlines using U.S. airports.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1979, two tires blew out on a Concorde at Kennedy
International Airport in New York on a flight that safely continued
on to Paris. No investigation of that incident occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1981, blown tires at Dulles caused engine problems
and forced a landing at New York. The board said no preparations of
passengers were made for an emergency landing and the plane's
cockpit voice recorder was inoperative and had been for several
flights.
</P>
<P>
   The board called for a mandatory requirement that the landing
gear be left down after a blown-tire takeoff and that the plane
immediately return to the airport from which it took off.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Tuesday's crash, the pilot, Capt. Christian Marty,
told the Paris control tower that he could not lift the landing
gear.
</P>
<P>
   The board in 1981 also called for Air France to better train its
crews in following checklists and preparing for abnormal landings.
</P>
<P>
   The French transportation ministry, in responding to the U.S.
board on Jan. 7, 1982, said most of its recommendations were being
implemented, and the NTSB later listed the recommendations as ''no
longer applicable'' because of the airline's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The then-chief of the French ministry's accident investigation
bureau, J. P. Bonny, said in a letter to the NTSB that Air France
was following its recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   On the last mishap before Tuesday's crash, Bonny wrote, ''The
February 1981 incident should remain an isolated case.''

<HEADLINE> Cohen Proposes Military Food Subsidy  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to turn around an embarrassing problem,
the Pentagon Friday proposed giving grocery store debit cards to
low-income troops, so they would no longer have to use food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of Defense William Cohen said the plan to subsidize
military members' food purchases with an in-house Department of
Defense program would cost the Pentagon $31 million a year. It also
would help to some people who didn't qualify under the traditional
Agriculture Department food stamp program.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear how many would get the assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The idea must be approved by Congress and could begin within a
year after such approval, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will result in families being able to come off the rolls
of food stamps,'' Cohen said at news conference with visiting Swiss
President Adolf Ogi. ''This new plan is going to improve the
well-being of our junior members in the armed forces.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, approximately 6,300 U.S. troops were on food stamps.
That was greatly reduced from the 12,000 who got them in 1995 and
represents less than 1 percent of the 1.4 million men and women in
uniform.
</P>
<P>
   But the problem has become a political issue, with Republican
presidential candidate George W. Bush deploring that any U.S.
soldier would have to receive such assistance and Vice President Al
Gore saying earlier this year that he planned to make his own
recommendations on how to get them off.
</P>
<P>
   ''I strongly support the proposal announced by the Pentagon
today and urge Congress to act on it promptly,'' Gore said in a
statement late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Getting military pay raises and improving health and other
benefits has been a focus of recent budgets as the military seeks
to stem the tide of service members who have been leaving for jobs
in the hot civilian economy.
</P>
<P>
   Under a pay raise already approved, base salary going into
effect in January for a sergeant with six years in the service will
be $1,691 a month. Pentagon officials note that doesn't go far for
young military families with several children.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan announced by Cohen, the Department of Defense
would set up its own subsistence program, with eligible troops
being given electronic debit cards to use at base commissaries.
Other arrangements would be made for troops in remote areas not
served by military commissaries.
</P>
<P>
   The cards would contain a fixed monthly value based upon the
serviceman or woman's pay level and family size. Eligibility
guidelines would generally follow the Department of Agriculture
food stamp guidelines with ''a few important exceptions,'' the
Pentagon said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   First, the program would be handled on military installations,
making it more convenient than going to state offices that
administer the food stamp program, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the program will include troops who live off base and
also need help but have been ineligible because their off-base
housing allowance was counted as income. The housing allowance will
not be part of the calculation under the military plan. Officials
said they were unsure how many more troops this would add to
assistance rolls above the 6,300 now getting food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ''The subsistence program is the right thing to do for our men
and women in uniform,'' Cohen said. ''It addresses inequities in
current programs and continues the steps started last year with ...
pay raises'' and improvement in other military benefits.

<HEADLINE> Composer Iain Hamilton Dead at 78  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Iain Hamilton, the Scottish composer who turned
Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina,'' into an opera, has died at age 78.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton died July 21 in London, his former publisher, Schott &AMP;
Co., said. The cause of death was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Glasgow in 1922, Hamilton apprenticed as an engineer
before attending the Royal Academy of Music in London. He graduated
with top honors and began a prolific composing career. Hamilton's
first works were in a romantic style, but later pieces were noted
for their austerity, and his influences ranged from jazz to the
calypso rhythms of the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1961 and 1978 he was a professor of music at Duke
University in North Carolina, and also lived part time in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton wrote four symphonies and dozens of orchestral and
chamber works, but is known best for his vocal music, which
includes a cantata based on the poems of Robert Burns. ''Anna
Karenina,'' premiered by the English National Opera in 1981, was
hailed by The Sunday Times for the ''richness, density and
brilliance of its orchestral textures.''
</P>
<P>
   His other operas include ''Agamemnon,'' ''The Catiline
Conspiracy,'' based on a Ben Johnson play, and an adaptation of
Peter Shaffer's play ''The Royal Hunt of the Sun.''

<HEADLINE> Germany Bomb Raises Extremism Fear  </HEADLINE>
By HANS GREIMEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) -- During their last German class
together, a group of immigrants from the former Soviet Union
discussed Germany's extreme-right movement.
</P>
<P>
   On their way to catch the train home, nine were injured in a
bombing, and authorities said Friday they could not rule out
anti-Semitism or anti-foreigner sentiment as a motive.
</P>
<P>
   All the victims were immigrants from the former Soviet Union --
Russia, Lithuania, Ukraine and Azerbaijan -- and at least six were
also Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't rule out any motive, including an anti-foreigner
motive,'' prosecutor Johannes Mocken told reporters. ''We can't
rule out that someone placed this bomb to hit this group or one
member of it .... or it could be simple coincidence.''
</P>
<P>
   A $5,000 reward was offered for information leading to an
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The nine students were with a group heading for their trains to
nearby cities when the device exploded Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Shrapnel shot through the crowded station entrance, causing the
most serious injuries to a Ukranian couple. The 26-year-old woman,
identified only as Tatjana L., was five months pregnant and
miscarried. Her leg was nearly blown off, but doctors were able to
reattach the limb Friday and said her condition was improving.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Michail, 28, was hit in the abdomen and remained in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Classes were canceled Friday at the R. Welling language school,
where the students were taking a six-month German course funded by
the government to help them assimilate.
</P>
<P>
   Their teacher, Olga Pankratz, said the attack changed the mood
at the school. Just Thursday, they had incorporated a discussion of
the extreme-right into the class.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one felt threatened,'' Pankratz said. ''But the attack has
changed everything. ... Now I am afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   Her teacher said Tatjana L. had mastered German in just three
months, and was committed to establishing a new life and family in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was so happy about the baby. It was a child she had
planned to have with her husband that they couldn't afford in
Ukraine,'' Pankratz said. ''She had all the chances. She wanted to
work -- and she would surely have found something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bomb experts were trying to reconstruct the device Friday and
determine how it was set off: A timer would indicated a more random
attack, while remote control could suggest it was targeted at
specific people.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the large amount of shrapnel, officials said the
device might have been a fragmentation grenade or something
homemade.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Jewish community in Germany expressed ''shock
and dismay.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We are horrified by this attack on innocent people,'' said
Paul Spiegel.
</P>
<P>
   Germany Interior Minister Otto Schily said it was conceivable
that the act was motivated by anti-foreigner sentiment, but
cautioned against jumping to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should not fall into the mistake of creating a mood that
this could happen on every street corner,'' Schily said.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's Jewish community is going through an unprecedented
renaissance and is one of the fastest growing in the world because
of a a post-Cold War policy of granting German citizenship to Jews
from the former Soviet Union. Germany's Jewish population, which
stood at 500,000 before the Holocaust, was just 30,000 only five
years ago, but has surged to 80,000 as immigrants take advantage of
the policy and is projected to reach 120,000 in five years.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish community in Duesseldorf fits the model. Of its 6,300
members, 5,150 are new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are shocked that this could occur in Duesseldorf, a place
where these things so far have seemed impossible,'' said Michael
Szentei-Heise, the head of the local Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
   German officials have warned that neo-Nazis, while declining in
number nationwide, are becoming better organized and increasingly
prone to violence. Their attacks are usually random beatings or
crude Molotov cocktails tossed at specific targets.
</P>
<P>
   Police in the neighboring state of Lower Saxony reported a wave
of neo-Nazi graffiti in the last couple of days, including
swastikas and anti-Semitic slogans spray-painted on a memorial
marking mass graves near a former Nazi work camp near Bremen.
</P>
<P>
   The victims of Thursday's attack were remembered during a
Sabbath service at Duesseldorf's synagogue, where the Ukrainian
couple and two other victims are members.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Michael Goldberger said he spent the night at the hospital
with Michail's parents, who joined their son and his wife in
Germany eight months ago. ''They came here just for the future of
their children and this is what happens,'' Goldberger said.

<HEADLINE> State clears way for $28 million in public funding for mall  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNE YOUMANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - State officials on Friday stood by their
approval of a controversial New Haven mall project, moving the
developers one step closer to obtaining $28 million in state aid.
</P>
<P>
   Marc S. Ryan, the governor's top fiscal adviser, said his review
found the $500 million Galleria at Long Wharf would have no
significant impact on the environment, traffic or area retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan and the state Department of Economic and Community
Development initially approved the project in March, but opponents
of the mall fought for a new round of public hearings on the
potential impact of the mall.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings were held in June and early July; public comment
was heated and mixed. State officials spent the last two weeks
reviewing more than 3,000 pages of documents pertaining to the
mall.
</P>
<P>
   ''This project underwent more scrutiny than any other economic
development project of the last decade,'' Ryan said. ''And I feel
very confident saying there will be no significant impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision clears the way for the Connecticut Development
Authority to act on mall developers' request for $28 million in
special state funding. Officials said that funding, and a request
for $30 million in state bond money New England Development of
Newton, Mass. and the Fusco Corp. of New Haven are expected to
make, could be available by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the mall, who have filed more than a dozen lawsuits
against the project, say they will still press for the more lengthy
environmental review required when the potential impact is
significant. They argue the mall will worsen traffic around the
already congested Interstate 95-Interstate 91 interchange, increase
pollution and destroy businesses in downtown New Haven.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very obvious this mall will have a significant effect on
our lifestyle,'' said John Isaacs, owner of a downtown New Haven
shoe store and a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits. ''Just the fact
the state is trying to approve this so quickly is continued proof
the state is not working in the best interest of the public.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials concede there may be additional traffic and some
retailers may lose business, but say those problems will be
overshadowed by the 3,000 permanent jobs and $5.4 million dollars
in tax revenues which will be generated by the mall.
</P>
<P>
   New Haven ''is one of the few areas in the state to see
continued erosion of employment,'' Ryan said. ''You have to measure
the loss of sales with the impact of the continued erosion of
employment without the mall.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the effort to block the mall has been led
by Westfield America, Inc., the owner of four competing malls in
the region. The company has funneled millions into its legal
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Westfield lawyer Ron Cohen said the company has a right, along
with the retailers of downtown New Haven, to try to preserve its
business.
</P>
<P>
   ''Westfield built its malls in Connecticut with its own money,''
he said. ''This is as if we had a store on the corner and the
government was giving our competitor millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   New Haven Mayor John DeStefano said he was confident that
construction on the mall would begin by year's end.
</P>
<P>
   The 1.2 million-square-foot Galleria would be anchored by
Filene's, Lord &AMP; Taylor, Macy's and Nordstrom and have 150
specialty shops.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no doubt Westfield will continue to spend millions to
oppose this, but they're not going to be successful,'' DeStefano
said.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Rulers Ban Poppy Growing  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR SHAH
<TEXT>
<P>
   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) -- Afghanistan's Taliban rulers on Friday
ordered a complete ban on growing poppy, the plant from which
heroin is made and a major crop in the Central Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear what prompted the order from the Taliban's
Supreme Leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, which was reported on
Taliban-run Radio Shariat.
</P>
<P>
   The order comes just two months before planting season for poppy
growers in several provinces of Afghanistan, the largest
opium-producing nation in the world. Opium is squeezed from the
bulb of the crimson red poppy plant and made into heroin in
hundreds of laboratories tucked in the hills of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Omar threatened stiff penalties for farmers who ignored the ban
and said poppy crops would be destroyed, according to Radio
Shariat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whoever grows poppies will be punished severely,'' Omar
reportedly said. No details of punishments were reported.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Taliban have refused to implement a complete
ban on poppy growing, saying they need international money to help
farmers grow alternate crops.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment from the United Nations, which
lauded the Taliban's orders last year to farmers to reduce
production by one-third. While some farmers adhered to the order,
many farmers had a reduced yield only because of the devastating
drought which has ravaged much of southern and central Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban, who rule roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan, have
imposed a harsh brand of Islamic law that outlaws most forms of
entertainment and imposes strict controls on women.
</P>
<P>
   The northern-based opposition, led by ousted president
Burhanuddin Rabbani, controls the remaining 10 percent of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Airport security an issue after gunman walks into plane cockpit  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A mentally disturbed man charged with bursting
into the cockpit of a plane at John F. Kennedy Airport and holding
a gun to the pilot's head had plotted his brazen crime for months,
prosecutors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A criminal complaint says that shortly after his arrest, the
defendant, Aaron Commey, ''admitted that he had been planning to
take over an airplane for several months and he would have used a
handgun and knife that he was carrying against anyone who
resisted.''
</P>
<P>
   A dazed-looking Commey, 22, made a brief appearance Friday in
Brooklyn federal court, where he was ordered held without bail on
charges of attempted aircraft piracy, which carries a maximum
sentence of 20 years in prison. Assistant U.S. Attorney Seth Levine
called the crime ''brazen and calculated.''
</P>
<P>
   Magistrate A. Simon Chrein said the defendant would undergo a
psychiatric evaluation. ''He's announced he's had some problems,
and some that may be exercises in fantasy on his part,'' the judge
said.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Commey's attorney, Michael Schneider, said that
after talking to his client for more than an hour, ''I have
questions about his competency. ... It seems to be a very sad
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Thursday's incident raised questions of whether one
of the world's busiest airports has sufficient checks in place.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Hicks, a spokesman for the Port Authority that runs the
airport, said, ''No, there was not a security lapse. But do you
want to get into a gun battle in a crowded terminal?''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say Commey skirted a metal detector late Thursday
before terrorizing 143 passengers and the crew of a National
Airlines Boeing 757 bound for Las Vegas. The native New Yorker then
asked to be flown to Miami, Argentina, or Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   The passengers and crew escaped unharmed. Negotiators from the
FBI and the Port Authority police finally coaxed the gunman off the
empty plane early Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   His father, contacted by The Associated Press hours after the
ordeal, said the young man may be suffering from mental problems.
Aaron Commey made no specific demands during the five hours he was
on the plane, where his mood ranged ''from being calm to being
despondent to being agitated,'' said Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   The standoff began at about 10:30 p.m. Thursday at the security
check in front of the gate for National Airlines' Flight 19 in
Terminal 4. When Commey was approached by an unarmed security
officer, he brandished a 10mm automatic gun and ran about 40 feet
down a gangway onto the plane, which was ready to take off, said
Port Authority Police Chief William Cafaro.
</P>
<P>
   The guard pushed an emergency button, summoning airport police
officers who arrived ''within a minute or two,'' said Hicks.
</P>
<P>
   But Commey, who was unticketed, ''was already on the jet by the
time police got there,'' the PA spokesman said, adding that the
gunman believed he was boarding an international flight that would
take him to South America.
</P>
<P>
   When he told a flight attendant to shut the plane door, dozens
of passengers panicked and ran for the exit. ''I heard this bustle
and commotion behind me at the door and I heard a man's voice
saying, 'Just secure the door. Secure the door now,''' said
passenger Frank Clark.
</P>
<P>
   He said the gunman ''walked right through first class at a high
rate of speed toward the cockpit. People in the aisle across from
me, they said, 'He's got a gun,' that's when all hell broke loose
and basically they beat feet and I beat feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside the cockpit, Commey pointed the gun at the pilot's head,
police said. Meanwhile, passenger Dave Schlesinger saw an officer
aiming his own weapon at the cockpit door. ''I didn't know what was
going on until I saw (the officer) with a shotgun,'' Schlesinger
said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman then ordered the cabin crewmembers to clear the plane
of all passengers and to get off themselves. Some left through the
gangway, while others slid down an emergency chute at the rear,
Hicks said. The pilot left at 12:30 a.m., and the co-pilot at 1
a.m., followed by Commey at 3:35 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks said airport security personnel had done their job. ''The
situation was contained, handled without anyone hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weldon Kennedy, a retired FBI deputy director who headed up the
bureau's probe into the Oklahoma City bombing, said that in
Thursday's incident, ''The police response and negotiation team did
a very fine job in terms of resolving a potentially explosive and
lethal situation.''
</P>
<P>
   However, ''security everywhere at airports should be tighter
than it is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Kennedy said, the security checkpoints at airports
are relatively close to the planes. ''There should be more
distance,'' said Kennedy, speaking from Memphis, where he is vice
chairman of Guardsmark Inc., one of the nation's largest security
firms.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, questions also remained about Commey's motive.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Samuel, a native of Ghana who lives in Brooklyn,
spoke by telephone about the son he has not seen in nearly four
years. He said he had spoken to him by phone last year.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Commey told the AP that his Bronx-born son had grown up
here but moved to Milwaukee with his American mother and brother
several years ago, and worked for a company there. The parents were
divorced; the elder Commey said he works for the New York City
Transit Authority.
</P>
<P>
   His son ''wasn't responding to the help that I was giving him,
just to finish school,'' Samuel Commey said, adding that he had
skipped many classes in his final year of high school. ''There
might be something wrong with him mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   In Milwaukee, a man who lives on the same floor of an apartment
building as Aaron Commey, said he last saw him about a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was kind of quiet. He'd just come and go,'' said neighbor
Tony Eastern.
</P>
<P>
   Police in both cities said the suspect apparently has no
criminal record.

<HEADLINE> Woman sentenced for murder 73-year-old man  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UTICA, N.Y. (AP) - Like her accomplice, a woman will spend 25
years to life in prison for killing a retired postal worker who was
lured to his death after a night of bar-hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Voorhees, 53, received the maximum penalty Friday in
Oneida County Court - the same sentence imposed Wednesday on Harold
Carter, her 42-year-old partner.
</P>
<P>
   Voorhees and Carter were convicted last month of second-degree
murder and robbery in the slaying of Glenn W. Morgan Jr. following
a rare dual-jury trial.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan disappeared after celebrating his 73rd birthday in
mid-August 1999. His decaying corpse was found several days later
about 15 feet down a brush-strewn embankment in suburban Utica by a
woman walking on a nearby sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The body was found several miles from the Whitesboro American
Legion post where Morgan met Voorhees the night he disappeared. The
pair drove into Utica and went to several bars with Carter,
according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Voorhees and Carter, both of Utica, lured Morgan to
a pavilion in the town of Marcy and robbed him of his 1999 Saturn
automobile and an undetermined amount of cash. Morgan, a widower,
was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Authorities prepared for protesters, crowds on RNC opening day  </HEADLINE>
By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - When delegates, protesters, spectators and
reporters arrive here Sunday for opening festivities of the
Republican National Convention, they won't be alone. At least 1,000
law enforcement officers - uniformed and undercover - will be
joining them.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Joseph Wysocki of the Camden Police Department said Friday
that a detailed security plan is in place for the duration of the
convention, which opens Sunday night with events here and continues
in Philadelphia through Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Between 10,000 and 15,000 Republicans are expected to attend
Sunday night's dessert reception along the waterfront by the RCA
pier, then watch a boat parade, a light show on the Benjamin
Franklin Bridge and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   Wysocki said 20,000 to 30,000 spectators also are expected.
Earlier in the day, three groups advocating various issues will
march through the city.
</P>
<P>
   Wysocki said the city Police Department, the Camden County
Prosecutor's Office, Sheriff's Office, Park Police, Delaware River
Port Authority, State Police, the Attorney General's Office and
police departments from other Camden County towns have been working
together for seven months on an ''extensive'' security plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the primary things, there's always the possibility of a
civil disturbance erupting, is to get people in and out of the
event safely and efficiently,'' he said, adding that most of the
officers would be handling traffic and crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   All 410 members of the Camden Police Department will be on duty
in staggered shifts lasting until 8 a.m. Monday, Wysocki said.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't be specific, but also said more than 400 State
Police troopers, both plainclothes and uniformed, will be
patrolling.
</P>
<P>
   State Police Sgt. Al Della Fave also declined to say exactly how
many troopers would be on hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We never divulge numbers. That would be defeating the purpose
if the bad guys knew how many extra troopers they could expect,''
he said. ''There'll be a presence there, especially if it gets to
the point where Camden needs additional help.''
</P>
<P>
   Wysocki also said ''numerous'' plainclothes officers from the
Camden County Prosecutor's Office would be patrolling all week.
</P>
<P>
   Another 100 sheriff's officers and 110 officers from surrounding
Camden County municipalities will be in the city Sunday, he said. A
reserve force from those communities also will be on call in case
they're needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever may happen, we're ready for it,'' Wysocki said.
</P>
<P>
   Three groups - South Jersey Unity 2000, a group opposed to the
U.S. Naval presence on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques and one
headed by City Councilman Ali Sloan El - plan marches through the
city. He said the groups have obtained permits to march with a
maximum of 900 people.
</P>
<P>
   Wysocki said two other smaller groups - Save the Elephants and
Free the Imprisoned Fish - applied for permits to protest but never
followed up on their requests.

<HEADLINE> Church deacon sentenced to 10 to 30 years for time share scam  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan church deacon was sentenced Friday
to 30 years in prison and ordered to repay $3.2 million he stole
from investors by selling them vacation time shares in nonexistent
apartments in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Odalis R. Rosado, 57, of Washington Heights, was sentenced by
State Supreme Court Justice John Stackhouse, who called the church
official ''a modern day Jekyll and Hyde'' responsible for
''destroying people's lives and dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosado, prosecuted by the state attorney general's office, was
convicted July 6 on charges of grand larceny and securities fraud.
He must serve 10 years before he is eligible for parole.
</P>
<P>
   An indictment filed last December accused Rosado of defrauding
60 families out of amounts ranging from $3,000 for time shares to
$72,000 for complete apartments that did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado had claimed the apartments were at Playa Bonita in Nagua,
Dominican Republic, but Brad Maione, a spokesman for Attorney
General Eliot Spitzer, said the apartments were never built because
the sponsor ran out of money. He said Rosado sold apartments and
shares anyway and simply kept the money for himself. None of the
money has been recovered, Maione said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosado, a deacon at St. Elizabeth's Church in Washington
Heights, ''wrongly used his position and stature in the community
to take advantage of, and steal from, those who trusted him,''
Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the 11 victims who spoke to the court said she had been
approached by others to invest in real estate projects but had
rebuffed them. She said she invested with the defendant because his
position with the church and because she trusted him.
</P>
<P>
   Maione said another man, Wascar de Pena of Santo Domingo, was
charged along with Rosado in December. That man is a fugitive and
is believe to be in the Dominican Republic, Maione said.

<HEADLINE> Aide Says He Lied About FBI Files  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The key figure in the FBI files controversy
admitted lying to Congress and to a federal grand jury, but a final
report revealed Friday that he could not be prosecuted because he
was granted immunity by Independent Counsel Ken Starr.
</P>
<P>
   A special federal appeals court issued the final report on the
activities of Anthony Marceca, an Army detailee who, as a temporary
White House employee, collected hundreds of FBI background files in
1993-94 based on an outdated Secret Service list. Many of the files
were those of ex-White House pass-holders from the presidencies of
Ronald Reagan and George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   When Marceca's actions were discovered in 1996, Republican
critics alleged that the Clinton White House was waging a campaign
to gather dirt on political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Robert Ray closed out his investigation of
the FBI files issue in March without prosecuting anyone, concluding
that none of the sensitive material had been misused.
</P>
<P>
   But the final report released by the court reveals that under
Starr's grant of immunity, Marceca admitted last September ''that
he had knowingly testified falsely'' to a grand jury and twice to
the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee in 1996 shortly
after the controversy erupted.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the report, Marceca's lawyers attributed
''inconsistencies'' in their client's statements primarily to
''confusion'' between Marceca and his interrogators concerning
''the purport of the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, chairman of the committee that Marceca admitted
giving false testimony to, said, ''Anthony Marceca lied to Congress
and it's disappointing that he won't be punished. Perjury and
selective memory loss in congressional investigations are a growing
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   In his immunized testimony, Marceca admitted that in the midst
of his gathering of FBI files, he realized that he was collecting
data on some people who were no longer at the White House and
didn't have passes anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Marceca admitted testifying falsely in 1996 by having told
Congress and a grand jury the opposite -- that it didn't occur to
him that some people on the Secret Service list he was using were
no longer pass-holders, according to Ray's final report.
</P>
<P>
   In his immunized testimony, Marceca also admitted that he lied
by telling congressional investigators in 1996 that ''he didn't
waste time'' reading some of the background reports.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ray's final report, Marceca admitted that he read
the FBI files as soon as he received them, seeking information for
''previous arrests, ... that sort of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Marceca testified that his superior, White House security
director Craig Livingstone, ''told him to review the reports for
derogatory information that might reflect on suitability for White
House employment,'' said the final report.
</P>
<P>
   In his immunized testimony, Marceca said he reported derogatory
information to Livingstone just three times.
</P>
<P>
   Of his answer four years ago to congressional investigators
saying that he didn't read some of the reports, Marceca admitted to
prosecutors last September that ''it was obviously false. The
answer is false,'' according to Ray's final report.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Marceca's immunized testimony ''could never be used
to prosecute him,'' Ray's report stated that the ''central issue''
for the independent counsel was whether ''Mr. Marceca's conduct
reflected a conspiracy within the White House to compile derogatory
information from confidential FBI background reports.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the independent counsel's probe did fingerprint testing
and took testimony from a range of witnesses. That plus the
immunity grant to Marceca led ''to the independent counsel's
conclusion that no senior White House official'' or first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton ''engaged in any criminal conduct related to
Mr. Marceca's requests for FBI background reports,'' the final
report stated.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the FBI lab examined bureau files of people including
former Republican officials James A. Baker III, Brent Scowcroft,
Tony Blankley and Kenneth Duberstein for fingerprints of Marceca
and his boss, Craig Livingstone, then-White House counsel Bernard
Nussbaum and associate White House counsel William Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The FBI's reports ... reflected that four fingerprints were
developed on Secretary Baker's report folder, all of which belonged
to Mr. Marceca,'' said Ray's report. Five fingerprints identified
as those of a colleague of Marceca were on Scowcroft's report, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Otherwise, there were no fingerprint matches with senior White
House staff or Mrs. Clinton,'' it said. ''No conspiracy existed.''
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's probe also produced no evidence ''that
Mr. Marceca was an unwitting participant in a conspiracy involving
senior officials,'' the report added.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report's thorough canvassing of Mr. Marceca's testimony
effectively rules out a conclusion that Mr. Marceca acted with any
deceitful design,'' wrote Marceca's lawyers, Robert Muse and Robert
Weinberg.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Marceca provided accurate testimony on the central issue,
namely, whether he or other White House personnel had requested FBI
files for improper purposes,'' Marceca's lawyers said.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Putin Meets With Oligarchs  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin promised Russia's top
business moguls Friday that post-Soviet economic privatization will
not be reversed, but his words did little to assuage their concerns
over a wave of police actions against large companies.
</P>
<P>
   Putin met in the Kremlin with 21 heads of some of Russia's
largest companies to discuss the recent police actions, which
include arrests of business leaders and criminal proceedings
against several companies. While many of the business leaders
emphatically praised the talks afterward, they conceded that few
specific agreements have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Putin made no promise to curb police actions against large
businesses. While Russian and foreign investors have criticized the
actions as harming the business climate, they have proven widely
popular among ordinary Russians, who have fared poorly during the
economic chaos since the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Putin gave ''no clear answer'' about whether the crackdown will
continue, said reformist lawmaker Boris Nemtsov, who helped set up
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ''But (Putin) said one thing: That the law-enforcement system
must work, and nobody can get in the way of the law-enforcement
system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Putin's office said ''the president once again
confirmed that the powers do not intend to revise the results of
privatization.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin agreed to let the business leaders form an advisory
council to discuss their concerns with the Kremlin every few months
-- a deal that won lavish praise by some businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got the impression from the meeting that Russia's
powers-that-be, as represented by the president, regard business
leaders more as allies in implementing economic programs, rather
than in some other capacity,'' said Vladimir Potanin, owner of
Norilsk Nickel company.
</P>
<P>
   But the chief executive of the Uralmash-Izhora industrial
holding company, Kakha Bendukidze, said the meeting did little to
ease the businessmen's minds about the spate of police actions
against private companies.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, police and prosecutors have tried to overturn
the privatization of metallurgical giant Norilsk Nickel. They have
also filed tax evasion charges against oil company Lukoil and
Russia's largest car maker, Avtovaz.
</P>
<P>
   Russian police attracted world attention when masked officers
carrying machine guns arrested media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky on
charges of defrauding the state in a privatization deal. The
charges were dropped this week.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Russia and abroad have criticized the actions as a
government campaign to intimidate business leaders, particularly
those who do not support Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has said he merely intends to make all equal before the
law by treating large companies the same as regular citizens. He
came to office earlier this year promising to cut the lucrative
ties that some business leaders had cultivated with government
during the administration of his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the Vimpelkom mobile communications company, Dmitry
Zimin, said that even though the business community wants to be
law-abiding citizens, sometimes it is forced to bend the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to live according to the law, but our laws are still
rather vague,'' he told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Bendukidze said legal chaos and huge taxes, which many
businesses are forced to dodge to avoid going broke, open the way
for ''selective'' prosecution by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as the tax burden is not reduced, the basis of fear
will not go away,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton marches with children; backs Chelsea's decision  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSWEGO, N.Y. (AP) - Senate candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton
marched Friday with hundreds of children through the streets of a
small city on Lake Ontario and told reporters she was completely
behind her daughter's decision to take the rest of the year off
from college.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a great idea. She has more then enough credits to
graduate on time with her class'' next spring, the first lady said
after marching in the children's parade at Oswego's Harborfest
celebration. ''If I were 20 years old ... I would want to spend
those last months in the White House. It's all part of history. I
don't think there's anything she could study that would ever give
her that opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, White House officials announced that Chelsea
Clinton, going into her senior year at Stanford University, would
be taking off the fall term to spend more time with her father
during his last months in office, and to help her mother's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Friday continued to attack Clinton's Republican
opponent, U.S. Rep. Rick Lazio, for seeking funds for a
controversial group which believes AIDS is not caused by the HIV
virus. And the Lazio campaign said it has accepted invitations to
participate in three debates.
</P>
<P>
   With a kente cloth scarf around her neck, Clinton marched with
the children down the main streets of Oswego with West African
music setting the cadence for the parade. The parade's theme this
year was West Africa. Lining the streets were hundreds of
Oswego-area residents, almost all of them white.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady marched with a group of children and with Oswego
Mayor John Gosek and his family. Asked how he felt about marching
with a Democrat, the Republican mayor smiled and said, ''Tomorrow's
going to be a tough day for me, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   In the park where the parade ended, Clinton shook hundreds of
hands and posed for dozens of photographs. Now and then,
spontaneous applause from bystanders broke out.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at the event was a Clinton booster.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Stanard, a young Oswego lawyer, showed up sporting a
T-shirt and signs promoting Lazio's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she's exploiting her position as first lady,'' the
Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to Stanard was Democrat Betty Cleary, also of
Oswego.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had a Hillary shirt, I'd be wearing it,'' the Democrat
said.
</P>
<P>
   Following the parade, the first lady made an unscheduled stop at
Fort Ontario, the site of the ''Safe Haven'' camp set up during
World War II for 982 refugees from the Nazi Holocaust
</P>
<P>
   The camp was established in 1944 by the late Harold Ickes,
President Franklin Roosevelt's interior secretary and his
assistant, Ruth Gruber. Ickes' son, Harold, is the first lady's top
political adviser.
</P>
<P>
   ''Safe Haven'' was also where state Liberal Party leader Raymond
Harding and his family lived when they fled Europe and the Nazis
during the war. Harding and his party are backing Clinton's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Friday, Democratic state Assemblyman Richard Gottfried
held a Manhattan news conference to criticize Lazio for assisting a
group that believes AIDS is not caused by the HIV virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one should have anything to do with a group that is
spreading this kind of dangerous message,'' said Gottfried, who
chairs the Assembly health committee. ''It's just astonishingly
irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottfried said Lazio's writing letters on behalf of the San
Francisco-based Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of HIV/AIDS
gave credibility to an organization whose message he said
undermines efforts to prevent AIDS. Gottfried was joined by
representatives of Gay Men's Health Crisis and the Gay and Lesbian
Independent Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999, Lazio wrote to U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services requesting a meeting between federal officials and
members of the group. His spokesman Dan McLagan said Lazio does not
share the group's view on the cause of AIDS, but wanted to help it
get money for ''alternative treatment'' methods.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lazio has given a bunch of crazy people some credibility,''
said Marty Algaze, a spokesman for Gay Men's Health Crisis. ''We
were shocked.''
</P>
<P>
   At a fund-raiser Friday at an Oswego home, Clinton also went
after Lazio for attempts to provide funding for the group.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's one of these really wacky, off-the-wall groups that he's
been trying as hard as he could to get money for,'' she said.
''You're taking money away from legitimate scientists and a search
for a cure and vaccine, instead to funnel it to these folks who are
on the right wing of the Republican Party and who have a set of
beliefs that are not scientifically sound.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio's campaign manager Bill Dal Col said Lazio has accepted
three debate invitations, in Buffalo and New York City in September
and in New York City in October. The Buffalo event will be hosted
by the Buffalo News and NBC Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert
while the first New York City debate will be hosted by Marcia
Kramer of WCBS and the second by Gabe Pressman of WNBC, Dal Col
said. Dates were still being worked out Friday, Lazio campaign
spokesman Patrick McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment Friday from the Clinton campaign
whether she would participate. On Thursday, the first lady said she
is eager to debate Lazio.

<HEADLINE> This July could be one of NJ's coolest  </HEADLINE>
By DERRICK HENRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Terrell Dixon sat beneath a shade tree,
watching the lunchtime traffic, waiting for his bus to take him
home. A pleasant breeze blew across his gray pants and his cyan
T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon, of Trenton, was one of millions of New Jerseyans on
Friday experiencing what could be one of the coolest months of July
in 100 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all right,'' said Dixon, 16, who attends McCorristin High
School. ''You can do more stuff. You can play basketball or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Dixon said he couldn't have said the same thing last summer,
when a prolonged drought caused temperatures to regularly go above
90 degrees. The record sizzler even damaged crops and caused power
blackouts during the Independence Day weekend when people cranked
up air conditioners.
</P>
<P>
   But this July is different. Most weather stations statewide have
recorded only two days when temperatures went above 90 degrees,
according to Dave Robinson, New Jersey State climatologist at
Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is quite unusual,'' Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   In Newark, the state's largest city, only three days exceeded
the 90-degree mark.
</P>
<P>
   And New Brunswick, where weather records have been kept since
1893, ''is knocking on the door for the coolest July on record,''
Robinson said. The city is close to the July 1923 record of an
average temperature of 71.4 degrees. This month's average
temperature for the city has been 71.2 degrees. Weather fans will
have to wait a few days to see if a new record is set.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening is a weak, low-pressure system from the
Carolinas is slowly making its way across the region and a
high-pressure system to the north is holding it at bay, Robinson
said. The result is a lot of clouds and moisture.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's horrible,'' said Louise Smout, 62, of Hamilton
Township. Smout, who is retired, said although the cooler, cloudy
weather can be pleasant, it also can become too much. ''I gotta
have sun. I feel better when the sun is out.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Motissol, 17, of Trenton, said she would prefer warmer
weather. ''I liked last year. It wasn't raining as much,'' she
said, adding she would rather be on a California beach.
</P>
<P>
   The coolest July on record for New Jersey was in 1895, when the
temperature averaged 70.6 degrees, according to state climate
records. Second place goes to July 1914, when the average was 71.2
degrees. Third coolest is shared by 1924 and 1962 with an average
of 71.3 degrees for July.
</P>
<P>
   Weather experts will have to wait until next month to determine
if July 2000 will go down as one of the coolest. But Robinson, the
state climatologist, said it's a safe bet to say this July will be
one of the top five coolest because it's so close to the end of the
month and forecasters predict the cool weather will persist through
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Rain also has been falling at a higher than normal rate in New
Jersey. Last July, rainfall for the month was 1.42 inches, the
fourth driest July, according to records dating back to 1895. The
normal rainfall average is 4.43 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The northeast corner of the state this month has received over 6
inches of rain, Robinson said. The extreme southern portion of the
state has also had a lot of rain, making for the wettest month of
the year so far.
</P>
<P>
   It seems certain rainfall will exceed the state average for this
month, with just over 5 inches, Robinson said.

<HEADLINE> State Parole Board chairman resigns  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The embattled chairman of New Jersey's
Parole Board resigned Friday amid reports that he is the subject of
a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Consovoy of Mount Laurel submitted his resignation from
the $92,750-a-year job to Gov. Christie Whitman, effective Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Consovoy has been a board member since 1989. Whitman made him
chairman two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He was called into the governor's office last week to answer
questions about his dealings with former organized crime figures,
including one who was paroled after a personal hearing with the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Consovoy, who is said to have a heart ailment, is on medical
leave. He did not immediately return a telephone message left on a
home answering machine Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He met with administration officials before taking ill, Whitman
spokesman Peter McDonough has said.
</P>
<P>
   Several newspapers have reported that law enforcement agencies
are investigating Consovoy's role in the early parole of a mob
leader.
</P>
<P>
   State police detectives are reportedly examining what steps
Consovoy took before Michael Perna, a one-time lieutenant with the
Lucchese crime family, was paroled from state prison in June 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Three months later, Perna was in federal custody. He was
eventually sentenced to 25 years on new federal and state charges.
</P>
<P>
   Perna's parole came after a meeting with Consovoy, who then
recommended parole. The chairman has defended his actions as
proper, according to published reports.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are also examining the release of other
mob-connected felons as well as other inmates under Consovoy's
tenure, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. refused
Friday to discuss any investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''Andy Consovoy has served the people of New Jersey well. From
his early days as a probation officer, through his days in the Kean
administration, to his service on the State Parole Board, Andy
Consovoy has been a dedicated public servant,'' Whitman said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said Whitman will nominate someone to replace him as
board chairman. Until then, member William T. McCargo will serve as
acting chairman, he said.

<HEADLINE> Beef recall affects lunch programs at Nebraska schools  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT BAUER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Enough beef to make nearly 20,000
quarter-pound hamburgers won't be distributed to Nebraska schools
due to a recall ordered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the 79,200 pounds of beef will sit in a southwest Omaha
warehouse until the USDA decides what to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA in June ordered a recall of 2 million pounds of beef
sent to 16 states for distribution to schools from Dallas-based
meatpacker Supreme Beef Processors Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The recall announcement came amid a quarrel over sanitary
conditions at Supreme Beef.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Carpenter, an administrator with the Agriculture
Department in Washington, D.C., said Friday that the meat was
recalled because of the company's failure to meet USDA quality
standards, not any specific problem with the meat in question.
</P>
<P>
   The meat was shipped in late April to Nebraska for use in
schools participating in the federal school lunch program. None of
the meat ever left the warehouse, said Brad Petersen, an accountant
with the Nebraska Health and Human Services System.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska was notified of the recall in June and school officials
were told that same month to find other sources of beef for the
coming school year.
</P>
<P>
   John Bonaiuto, director of the Nebraska Association of School
Boards, said no school had contacted him with fears about having an
adequate beef supply for the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't heard a thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schools may either cut back on the amount of beef offered for
lunches early in the year or find another source, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beef supplied from the USDA for the school lunch program
accounts for about 20 percent of all beef used by the state's
schools, said Connie Stefkovich, administrator of nutrition
services for the state Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA will replace the recalled beef but probably not until
October, Petersen said.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has tried to temporarily close
Supreme Beef after the plant failed a series of federally required
tests for salmonella bacteria, which can cause digestive ailments.
</P>
<P>
   A federal judge ruled in May that the testing was not a fair
measure of a plant's sanitation and the judge barred the department
from withdrawing its inspectors, an action that would force the
plant to close.
</P>
<P>
   The USDA said last month that it was planning new safety
standards for the ground beef it buys for schools. The rules will
be similar to testing requirements that McDonald's and other fast
food restaurants impose on meatpackers.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 states where the meat was shipped are: Connecticut,
Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Iowa, Idaho, Massachusetts,
Mississippi, New York, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Texas, and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Four witnesses testify at inquiry in death of Connecticut artist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROAD TOWN, British Virgin Islands (AP) - Eleven witnesses have
testified this week at an inquiry to determine whether four
Americans should stand trial in the slaying of a Connecticut
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing at the Eastern Caribbean High Court will continue
Wednesday. Testimony from a forensic expert on DNA test results
expected this week was delayed because the evidence did not arrive
from London, where it was being analyzed, sources close to the
inquiry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence includes clothing seized from the defendants at the
time of their arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Such inquiries are not open to the public and lawyers say they
are barred from revealing details of testimony. Sources close to
the proceedings said a medical examiner testified on Friday, but
they could not report what was said. It is not yet clear when the
inquiry will end.
</P>
<P>
   The drowned body of artist Lois Livingston McMillen of
Middlebury, Connecticut, was discovered by a roadside Jan. 15. She
had been staying at her family's vacation home on Tortola in the
British Virgin Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects are Michael Spicer, 36, a law student from
Washington, D.C., and a longtime neighbor of the McMillens on
Tortola, and his house guests: Evan George, 22, a construction
worker from Washington; investment banker William Labrador, 36, of
Southampton, N.Y.; and Alexander Benedetto, 34, who works for a
book publisher in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   All deny the charges and deny being with McMillen the night she
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   They have been jailed since their arrests soon after the body
was found. If convicted, they could be sentenced to life in prison.

<HEADLINE> Clashes at Fujimori Inauguration  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peruvians furious with the inauguration of
Alberto Fujimori as Peru's president set government buildings
ablaze Friday and chanted ''the dictatorship will fall!'' Tear gas
and smoke turned the skies over the capital dark amid pitched
street battles.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators -- some peaceful, but others
throwing rocks and breaking windows -- filled the streets. Inside
the heavily guarded Congress building, a beaming Fujimori ignored
the unrest sparked by a May 28 re-election many said was fraudulent
and celebrated the beginning of an unprecedented third five-year
term. It was also his 62nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori wore the red-and-white presidential sash and raised his
arms in a victory sign as opposition congressmen shouted insults
and waved signs that read ''New Elections Now.'' As Fujimori began
his inaugural address, they walked out in protest of a vote tainted
by charges of widespread fraud.
</P>
<P>
   At least 35 people -- police and demonstrators -- were injured in
the protests and the toll was expected to rise, said Lima Fire
Chief Rafael Calvo. Smaller protests also erupted in Arequipa,
Peru's second-largest city, some 465 miles southeast of Lima.
</P>
<P>
   One of those hurt was a bloody-faced foreign journalist who was
taken away in an ambulance after being hit in the face by a flying
tear gas canister. It was unclear who the correspondent worked for.
</P>
<P>
   As Fujimori swore to respect the country's constitution, riot
police outside fired bullets and tear gas into the crowds. A fire
burned out of control in the lobby of the former Education
Ministry, one of the tallest office towers in downtown Lima. Later,
protesters' fires gutted the state bank building and the National
Elections Board.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke poured from the buildings and mixed with pungent
tear gas. At one point a jetfighter screeched overhead as
black-clad riot police and demonstrators battled on the streets
below. Some 40,000 police had been called out.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's vow to protect the constitution provoked jeers from
opposition congressmen, who accuse him of violating it many times
during his decade in power. Others held a sign that read ''Majority
Bought,'' a reference to accusations Fujimori gained control of the
legislature by paying opposition congressmen to jump ship to give
his alliance a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The president pledged to ''strengthen democratic institutions
... and generate jobs and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters had been called by opposition candidate Alejandro
Toledo, who boycotted the May presidential runoff and accused
Fujimori of planning to rig the results. He had planned to
discredit Friday's inauguration by organizing thousands for an
outpouring of ''peaceful resistance,'' but violence quickly erupted
as demonstrators marched toward Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo blamed the unrest on pro-Fujimori infiltrators sent to
discredit the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peru does not want violence,'' said the 54-year-old
Stanford-trained economist.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators blocked firefighters trying to extinguish the
Education Ministry blaze, hurling long poles and shattering its
lobby windows as black smoke rose over the rooftop. The two sides
fought over fire hoses and firefighters pleaded with demonstrators
to let them combat the flames and allow three injured building
guards to be evacuated in ambulances. They got out.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, hundreds reached the Plaza de Armas, the
400-year-old colonial heart of Lima. There they attacked the
National Palace -- the president's official residence -- hurling
rocks, breaking windows and chipping away at the concrete cornices
of the historic building. They set bonfires before police charged
out of side streets and drove them away with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   They also attacked the nearby Palace of Justice, Peru's main
court building and a hated symbol of corruption in the legal system
for many Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1,500 of the protesters appeared to be trying to
break past police lines. Demonstration leaders urged people to stop
throwing rocks, but were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed troopers chasing demonstrators through
clouds of wafting tear gas. Protesters fled into side streets,
coughing and choking. Some dropped to the ground and appeared to
faint.
</P>
<P>
   The injured foreign journalist's face and head were covered in
blood after he was hit by the tear gas canister that shattered his
gas mask. An Associated Press correspondent said he watched as the
journalist was helped into an ambulance and taken away.
</P>
<P>
   A Peruvian journalist, Paola Ugaz of the opposition weekly
Caretas, said she helped the man after the canister hit him in the
face and apparently broke his nose. She said his injuries did not
appear to be life-threatening. No details of his condition were
available.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's protests were believed to include some 80,000 Fujimori
opponents. The government sent in about 40,000 security forces.
Throngs chanted ''Democracy, yes! Dictatorship, no!'' and ''The
dictatorship is going to fall!'' and held a red banner emblazoned
with the word ''DEMOCRACIA.''
</P>
<P>
   In a fiery speech Thursday night to kick off the protests,
Toledo said: ''We are going to rescue liberty and democracy from
the clutches of the dictator.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Marines Face Drug Charges  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three Marines who provide security at the
Naval Academy in Annapolis will face drug charges in a special
court-martial following an investigation into use of the
mood-altering drug ecstasy at the installation, officials said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The names of the Marines are being withheld until the
proceedings are finished, said a statement released by the Marine
Barracks in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they will be charged with possession and use of a
controlled substance. No date has been set for the special
court-martial.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's statement did not mention ecstasy, but officials
confirmed earlier this month that drug use had been detected in the
Marine company serving at the Maryland academy. It was found in one
of the random tests the Marine Corps conducts at every
installation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The charges follow an investigation by Navy criminal
investigators and the Marine Barracks in Washington. While the 65
to 75 Marines in the detachment live at the academy in Annapolis --
and provide security and ceremonial functions -- they receive orders
from the Washington base.
</P>
<P>
   Ecstasy has been growing in popularity among young adults, and
produces a rapid heartbeat, increased energy and heightened
sensitivity to touch.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Ends Down 179; Dow Falls 75  </HEADLINE>
By BRUCE MEYERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks slid again Friday, hurtling
the Nasdaq composite index down 10 percent for the week. The broad
market also fell after the government's gross domestic product
figures suggested that inflationary pressures might not be easing
after all.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, down nearly 200 points in late trading, ended the
day off 179.23 at 3,663.00, down 431 points for the week and the
lowest finish since June 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 74.96 to 10,511.17, a loss
of 222.39 or about 2 percent for the week.
</P>
<P>
   Among other broad-market indicators, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
fell 29.73 to 1,419.89, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller
companies fell 11.39 to 490.22.
</P>
<P>
   Before trading began, the Commerce Department reported that the
U.S. economy as measured by the GDP grew at a robust annual rate of
5.2 percent in the spring. A surge in investment by American
businesses offset a slowdown in consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
   However, an inflation gauge tied to the report and favored by
Federal Reserve officials showed that prices rose at an annual rate
of just 2.3 percent in the second quarter, down from a first
quarter rate of 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the unexpected acceleration in activity during the
second quarter came as a surprise to economists, compounding
concerns raised a day earlier by reports showing large increases in
employment costs and big-ticket factory orders.
</P>
<P>
   Unless mitigated by signs of slowing before the next Fed meeting
on Aug. 22, the latest economic readings might force the central
bank to boost interest rates again in a bid to slow the economy and
contain inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ''The report provides fuel for both sides of the Fed debate,''
said Scott Brown, an economist for Raymond James &AMP; Associates in
St. Petersburg, Fla. But Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan ''should be
happy with this report,'' he added, predicting that interest rate
policy ''is likely to stay on hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Network equipment makers were prominent among the day's big
decliners with Cisco Systems falling $5.188 to $62.813 as the most
active Nasdaq issue.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, JDS Uniphase slid $12.375 to $116.25 amid news that
Royal Philips Electronics had sold 5 million of its JDS shares. And
Nortel Networks fell $5.125 to $73 after announcing an acquisition
initially valued at $7.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks helped lead the Dow lower amid the renewed
concerns about interest rates, which could hurt demand for loans.
American Express fell $2.50 to $55.813 and J.P. Morgan fell $1.75
to $130.438 as the Dow's two weakest components after Intel, down
$7.875 to $129.125.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 ratio on the
New York Stock Exchange and by an even wider margin on Nasdaq Stock
Market.
</P>
<P>
   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.185 billion shares, on par with
Thursday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 2.12 percent,
Germany's DAX index fell 0.77 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell
0.26 percent, and France's CAC-40 fell 1.47 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mayor says fight over city attorney racially, politically motivated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Mayor Milton Milan on Friday said a vote by
City Council urging the city attorney and his top assistant to
resign was fueled by politics and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Council members Thursday unanimously approved two resolutions
calling on City Attorney John A. Misci Jr. and his first assistant,
Marc A. Riondino, to step down.
</P>
<P>
   The resolutions said the legal representation by Misci and
Riondino has been inadequate and that council members ''have no
confidence'' in their ability to conduct the city's legal affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The resolutions called upon Misci and Riondino ''to act in the
best interest of the city'' and resign.
</P>
<P>
   Misci said he won't step down. Riondino did not immediately
return a telephone call from The Associated Press on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The council vote follows Milan's unexpected appointment Monday
of Misci as presiding municipal judge.
</P>
<P>
   Milan appointed Misci, 36, to replace Judge James W. Faison III,
whose three-year term expired Monday. Faison is the son of Council
President Gwendolyn Faison.
</P>
<P>
   But on Tuesday, state Superior Court Judge Francis J. Orlando
barred Misci from assuming the position, saying the nomination
needed to be approved by City Council and that he must be sworn in
by a state Superior Court judge.
</P>
<P>
   Milan on Friday said he had some ''concerns,'' which he didn't
disclose, about Judge Faison, and that council members ''changed it
around to a racial issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have a very serious negative impact on the city,''
the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Council members said they could not support Misci because it
would offset the racial balance on the political level, and because
he's white,'' Milan said. ''That stunned me.''
</P>
<P>
   All but one of the council's seven members are black or Latino.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Gilbert ''Whip'' Wilson said race had nothing to do
with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing racial about this whatsoever, not from where
I sit at least,'' he said. ''If Mr. Misci was African-American with
the same qualifications, I'd vote no. If he was Latino with the
same qualifications, I would vote no.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before Milan appointed Misci as a judge, Sloan El had drawn
up a resolution calling on Misci and Riondino to resign over their
handling of a $215 million contract for privatization of the city's
water and sewer systems.
</P>
<P>
   Sloan El also said he was concerned about a discrimination
lawsuit filed against Milan, Misci and Riondino by six black
current and former assistant city attorneys. Sloan El said that
indicates that Misci was mismanaging his office.
</P>
<P>
   Misci and Riondino have denied the allegations of
discrimination.

<HEADLINE> County sprays after confirmation of West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LIVERPOOL, N.Y. (AP) - Pesticide-laden spray trucks rolled
through a two-mile area Friday after state health officials
confirmed that a dead crow found in this suburban Syracuse village
was infected with the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   An infected crow also was found in Ulster County, in the
township of Rochester, said state Health Commissioner Antonia C.
Novello.
</P>
<P>
   Novello warned against any undue alarm over the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the virus killed seven people in New York City.
Since then, it has been found in New Jersey, Connecticut and
Maryland. There have been no known cases of human illnesses in New
York this year, although the virus has been previously confirmed in
birds or mosquitoes found downstate in the counties of Nassau,
Rockland, Suffolk, Orange and Westchester and in New York City,
Novello said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the farthest north the virus has been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't know whether finding infected birds in these
locations is an anomaly, since, to date, there have been no
infected birds or mosquitoes identified in either county, despite
ongoing surveillance,'' Novello said.
</P>
<P>
   In Onondaga County, Health Commissioner Dr. James Novak said the
spraying was a precaution. The spraying will concentrate on an area
within a two-mile radius of where the dead crow was found, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one isolation of one bird. We don't see a high risk
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spraying to control mosquitoes is an annual rite in the Syracuse
area, which features many wetlands and swamps. In a number of
recent years, the county has resorted to aerial spraying to kill
mosquitoes carrying Eastern equine encephalitis, another
potentially deadly disease transferred from animals to humans by
mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   In Ulster County, spraying has not yet begun but health
officials have tested more than 50,000 mosquitoes for the virus,
none of which has turned up positive. Farther south, in Orange
County, pesticides have been applied to standing water sources to
help control the mosquito population.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile disease is fatal in few people who contract it.
Most experience flu symptoms and don't realize they have been
exposed to the virus. Although the illness generally is mild, it
can cause serious brain infections in the elderly and in people
with weak immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was first isolated in 1937 in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Novak said crows are particularly susceptible to the virus and
for that reason are considered an important early warning sign that
infection could be present in a specific area. However, he added,
crows have a roosting range of 150 to 200 miles.
</P>
<P>
   To reduce the risk of infection, Novello recommends removing
standing water from around the house, fixing screens and wearing
repellant that contains DEET.

<HEADLINE> Police charge man with setting fire to pastor's home, other garages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KEARNY, N.J. (AP) - An 18-year-old man was charged with setting
fires that destroyed a pastor's home and damaged three garages,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Gehrmann confessed to setting a fire in Joon Soon
Hong's garage on July 14 that spread to his home, Police Capt.
James Corbett said. Gehrmann also admitted setting fires in three
other garages between July 14 and July 17, Corbett said. Gehrmann
set fire to an old canvas lawn chair and a shirt tied to a doorknob
to start some of the blazes, Corbett said.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrmann denied setting a fire on July 17 in the Grace United
Methodist Church, where Hong is the pastor for the church's Korean
population, Corbett said. Gehrmann is not considered a suspect in
that fire, which caused smoke damage to the church school building
and the nearby sanctuary, Corbett said.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrmann was charged Wednesday after he was arrested for
trespassing in a garage on his street, Corbett said.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in the Hudson County Jail Friday on $500,000 bail.
He was charged with four counts of arson, three counts of burglary
and one count of trespassing.

   Cox, representing the Adirondack region, was fastest in the open
women's 10,000-meter race on Friday at Binghamton University,
Rodriguez won the open men's 10,000, and Gorton was golden for the
eighth straight year in the open women's javelin throw.
</P>
<P>
   It was evident from the start that Cox was new to the 10,000. At
the start, she ran at the heels of pace-setting Jill Vollweller of
the Hudson Valley as the two broke away from the pack early. But
then Cox pulled alongside Vollweller for nine laps around the
400-meter track instead of staying tucked in behind her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know how to run track. I'm a marathoner,'' Cox, a
23-year-old special education teacher from Waterford, said. ''It
was a mental thing, I didn't want to be behind her. And then, when
I tucked in you expend so much less energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox, at the urging of two of her running partners on the
sidelines, finally took the lead for good with just under eight
laps remaining and beat Vollweller by 45 seconds, about half a
track.
</P>
<P>
   The elation of the moment was snuffed out a short while later
when Cox was disqualified for wearing improper running shorts and
the 32-year-old Vollweller was awarded the gold. That lifted
Christine Raulli of Rome in the Central to the silver and Sandra
Reulet of Saratoga Springs in the Adirondack region to bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, 29, a school counselor, had no idea how long her
gold-medal streak was. And without her cousin Clay coaching her,
she only throws twice a year now. Still, she was good enough to win
another gold with a toss of 153 feet, 2 inches, about 30 feet off
her personal best.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is all I do. I'm retired,'' said Gorton, who beat Lindsey
Stephenson of Hamburg in the Western region by just over four feet.
''But this is good. I was nervous coming in here because I haven't
been training and I never know who's going to show up. It's kind of
satisfying in a way, but on the other hand I feel guilty because I
know I haven't been training.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, also representing the Adirondack region, was
victorious in his first ESG race, finishing in 31 minutes, 34.29
seconds and beating Stephen Getman of Ithaca in the Central region
by 20 seconds. Todd Witzleben of the Western region took bronze.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not big on racing over the summer,'' said Rodriguez, a
junior to be at the University at Albany. ''A couple of my friends
and I wanted to get in better shape, so we all decided to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   In other track-and-field competition, Jaime Stitt of Ballston
Lake won the first-ever scholastic women's pole vault with a height
of 10-4 1/4 inches, edging Sarah Bentley of Scotia. Erika Frank of
Mohawk, who won the Class C state championship in the spring,
finished fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The Western region had 35 gold medals and remained atop the
medal count with 93. Central was second with 79 medals, 24 of them
gold, and Long Island had 66 medals, 24 of them gold. Adirondack
was up to fourth with 63 medals, 18 of them gold; New York City had
54 and 24 gold; and Hudson Valley was last with 51 medals,
including 16 golds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a banner day for several former champions: Arthur Jozwiak
of Rochester captured the scholastic men's 3,000-meter steeplechase
for the second straight year, beating Floyd Mayne of Long Island;
Byron Campbell of Tarrytown, who won the open men's 100-meter dash
last year, copped the 200 on Friday, beating out Joel Mascoll of
Brooklyn; Steven Santoli of Huntington Station, Long Island, won
his second straight gold in the open men's shot put; and Juliet
Brown of the Hudson Valley region, open women's champion a year ago
in the 100 meters, edged Alicia Crowd of Greenwich in the
Adirondack region in the 200.
</P>
<P>
   A thunderstorm interrupted the decathlon and several other
events around 4:30 p.m. but action resumed after more than an hour
delay.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Chechnya Talks Underway  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAGAS, Russia (AP) -- Russian officials on Friday confirmed that
long-rumored talks were being held with Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov and a top rebel commander, but the officials insisted
that surrender is the rebels' only way out.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, first revealed by President Vladimir Putin's regional
envoy Viktor Kazantsev, were confirmed by Putin's spokesman for
Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky. They come as the 11-month conflict
is in a bloody stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops occupy most of the republic but have been unable
to wipe out insurgents in Chechnya's southern mountains or prevent
them from infiltrating Russian-held cities, where they plant mines
and launch hit-and-run attacks.
</P>
<P>
   As the war bogs down, speculation has grown that Russia is
looking for a way to end it, but the Kremlin repeatedly has said
the rebels must surrender before any negotiations on a settlement
could begin.
</P>
<P>
   Yastrzhembsky insisted Friday that was still the case. He said
the talks boil down to ''only and exclusively a proposal of
capitulation,'' the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   But the fighting has sapped Russian morale and resources: ''The
military is also tired of war,'' Kazantsev said.
</P>
<P>
   His statement that talks were taking place with Maskhadov and
rebel commander Khamzat Gilayev came during a meeting with Chechen
refugee representatives in Magas, in the republic of Ingushetia
that borders Chechnya to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Kazantsev refused to say precisely who was conducting the talks,
where they were taking place or whether any progress had been
achieved. But Konstantin Makeyev, a deputy to Yastrzhembsky, said
the pro-Russian administrator of Chechnya, Mufti Akhmad Kadyrov,
was trying to persuade Maskhadov to lay down arms.
</P>
<P>
   Even if an agreement is reached, it is unclear how many of the
estimated 2,000 insurgents might respect it. Chechnya's rebels are
not under a unified command, and many are loyal to warlords who
disdain Maskhadov. Just a day earlier, Gilayev said fighters were
preparing a new large offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Russian forces on Friday pounded suspected rebel
positions outside the Chechen capital with heavy artillery, the
military said.
</P>
<P>
   Military officials said the strikes were aimed at some 200
rebels who had gathered south and southeast of the Grozny suburb of
Khankala, where Russian military headquarters in the area are
located.
</P>
<P>
   The military claimed to have killed and wounded rebels, but gave
no numbers. Both the Russian and Chechen sides regularly exaggerate
the other's losses and minimize their own.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops are trying to subdue Chechen independence
fighters in a renewal of a 1994-1996 war in which the rebels forced
Russian troops to withdraw. Moscow sent its troops back in in
September following raids from militants based in Chechnya into
Russian territory and the death of some 300 people in apartment
bombings blamed on Chechen terrorists.

<HEADLINE> In Margate, apprehension and questions over beach replenishment plan </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CURRAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARGATE, N.J. (AP) - Apprehensive and full of questions, about
200 residents of this Absecon Island community turned out Friday
for a town meeting on the government's controversial plan for a $60
million beach replenishment.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to pump sand
up from the bottom of Absecon Inlet and onto eroded beaches in
Atlantic City, Ventnor, Margate and Longport.
</P>
<P>
   About 8.1 miles of beach would also get a dune that would block
ocean views for some beachfront property owners. That element has
triggered fiery resistance.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the speakers at Friday's meeting called it
shortsighted to worry about views, saying protection of the beach
itself and the island were more important.
</P>
<P>
   With the federal government picking up 65 percent of the tab,
the city can't afford to say no, according to Phillip Perskie, 50,
one of the first residents to speak at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   He compared the plan to the Publisher's Clearinghouse and its
cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a little bit like Ed McMahon showing up at our door and
all of a sudden we're worrying whether we should take the award,''
Perskie said. ''We have to jump on this opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Others were concerned about the practical aspects of such a
giant project.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was here in the '44 hurricane,'' said Joe Zetooney, 75.
''What I can't quite understand is why the Corps is attacking the
symptoms, rather than the cause?''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested jetties to minimize the impact of storms and waves
on the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gottlieb, 44, said it wasn't only beachfront property owners
who oppose the project. He said he feared storms eroding the
beaches, leaving only the dunes.
</P>
<P>
   ''On July 4, are you going to be happy not having a place to sit
(on the beach) with your family?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He elicited a round of applause from the crowd when he recalled
the mistake made decades ago when the dunes that once lined the
beach were razed to make room for houses.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should keep things the way they are, and not make a big
mistake like we did 50 years ago,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lucas, chief of the coastal planning section for the
Corps' office in Philadelphia, told the crowd that the government
would not embark on the project unless the state agreed to it.
</P>
<P>
   The state, in turn, won't agree to it unless the affected
municipalities do, according to Bernie Moore, a coastal engineer
for the state Department of Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter suggested that there will be no beach to see if
the replenishment plan isn't approved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I live on the bayfront,'' said Phil DiBernardino, 58. ''But my
(ocean) view might get better if we don't do something.''

<HEADLINE> 2 Dead, 80 Injured at Fujimori Oath  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peruvians furious with the inauguration of
Alberto Fujimori as Peru's president set government buildings
ablaze Friday and chanted ''the dictatorship will fall!'' Tear gas
and smoke turned the skies over the capital dark amid pitched
street battles that left at least two dead and dozens injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators -- some peaceful, but others
throwing rocks and breaking windows -- filled the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the heavily guarded Congress building, a beaming Fujimori
ignored the unrest sparked by a May 28 re-election many said was
fraudulent and celebrated the beginning of an unprecedented third
five-year term. It was also his 62nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori wore the red-and-white presidential sash and raised his
arms in a victory sign as opposition congressmen shouted insults
and waved signs that read ''New Elections Now.'' As Fujimori began
his inaugural address, they walked out in protest of a vote tainted
by charges of widespread fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of two men, apparently security guards, were found in
the ashes of a state bank that was set ablaze, Fire Cmdr. Victor
Podesta said. At least 80 more people -- police and demonstrators --
were injured in the protests, four of them with bullet wounds,
hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those hurt was a bloody-faced foreign journalist who was
taken away in an ambulance after being hit in the face by a flying
tear gas canister. It was unclear who the correspondent worked for.
</P>
<P>
   As Fujimori swore to respect the country's constitution, riot
police outside fired bullets in the air and tear gas into the
crowds. A fire burned out of control in the lobby of the former
Education Ministry, one of the tallest office towers in downtown
Lima. Later, protesters' fires gutted a state bank building and the
building housing the National Elections Board.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke poured from the buildings and mixed with pungent
tear gas. At one point a jetfighter screeched overhead as
black-clad riot police and demonstrators battled on the streets
below. Some 40,000 police had been called out, and the office of
the human rights ombudsman said 80 people were detained.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller protests also erupted in Arequipa, Peru's second-largest
city, some 465 miles southeast of Lima. The violence was unusual in
a region where peaceful democratic elections have become
commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's vow to protect the constitution provoked jeers from
opposition congressmen, who accuse him of violating it many times
during his decade in power. Others held a sign that read ''Majority
Bought,'' a reference to accusations Fujimori gained control of the
legislature by paying opposition congressmen to jump ship to give
his alliance a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The president pledged to ''strengthen democratic institutions
... and generate jobs and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   The protesters had been called by opposition candidate Alejandro
Toledo, who boycotted the May presidential runoff and accused
Fujimori of planning to rig the results. He had planned to
discredit Friday's inauguration by organizing thousands for an
outpouring of ''peaceful resistance,'' but violence quickly erupted
as demonstrators marched toward Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo blamed the unrest on pro-Fujimori infiltrators sent to
discredit the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peru does not want violence,'' said the 54-year-old
Stanford-trained economist.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators blocked firefighters trying to extinguish the
Education Ministry blaze, hurling long poles and shattering its
lobby windows as black smoke rose over the rooftop. The two sides
fought over fire hoses and firefighters pleaded with demonstrators
to let them combat the flames and allow three injured building
guards to be evacuated in ambulances. They got out.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, hundreds reached the Plaza de Armas, the
465-year-old colonial heart of Lima. There they attacked the
National Palace -- the president's official residence -- hurling
rocks, breaking windows and chipping away at the concrete cornices
of the historic building. They set bonfires before police charged
out of side streets and drove them away with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   They also attacked the nearby Palace of Justice, Peru's main
court building and a hated symbol of corruption in the legal system
for many Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1,500 of the protesters appeared to be trying to
break past police lines. Demonstration leaders urged people to stop
throwing rocks, but were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed troopers chasing demonstrators through
clouds of wafting tear gas. Protesters fled into side streets,
coughing and choking. Some dropped to the ground and appeared to
faint.
</P>
<P>
   The injured foreign journalist's face and head were covered in
blood after he was hit by the tear gas canister that shattered his
gas mask. An Associated Press correspondent said he watched as the
journalist was helped into an ambulance and taken away.
</P>
<P>
   A Peruvian journalist, Paola Ugaz of the opposition weekly
Caretas, said she helped the man after the canister hit him in the
face and apparently broke his nose. She said his injuries did not
appear to be life-threatening. No details of his condition were
available.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's violence followed a peaceful rally Thursday by 80,000
Fujimori opponents. Throngs chanted ''Democracy, yes! Dictatorship,
no!'' and ''The dictatorship is going to fall!'' and held a red
banner emblazoned with the word ''DEMOCRACIA.''
</P>
<P>
   In a fiery speech Thursday night to kick off the protests,
Toledo said: ''We are going to rescue liberty and democracy from
the clutches of the dictator.''

<HEADLINE> GOP fundraiser convicted of obstruction in pay-for-parole case  </HEADLINE>
By TOM HAYS
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A wealthy Korean-American businessman was
convicted Friday of one of six charges he faced in an alleged
scheme with aides of Gov. George Pataki to secure parole for
violent convicts in exchange for campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   A federal jury found the defendant, Yung Soo Yoo, guilty of
obstruction of justice in what prosecutors called ''the biggest
fund-raising scandal this state has seen in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   But jurors told U.S. District Judge Frederic Block they were
deadlocked on two conspiracy and three corruption charges. Block
declared a mistrial on those counts and scheduled a new trial for
September at the request of prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still think they have the wrong guy,'' Yoo, 63, of Glen
Ridge, N.J., said as he left court.
</P>
<P>
   Said Assistant U.S. Attorney Margaret Giordano: ''We're
disappointed, but we're eagerly awaiting the retrial.'' A Pataki
spokesman, Michael McKeon, said, ''Everything this administration
did was right and proper.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated three days before reaching the partial
verdict in Brooklyn federal court. Although the obstruction of
justice charge carries a penalty of up to 10 years in prison,
prosecutors said Yoo, who his out on bail, would get less time.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, one juror said the jury deadlocked 10-2 in favor
of convicting Yoo on the other counts. The juror, who refused to
give her name, said the deliberations were ''rough.''
</P>
<P>
   The verdict followed two weeks of testimony during which Yoo and
a top Pataki campaign aide, Patrick Donohue, were accused of
promising three families they could buy ''samyun'' - Korean for
''clemency'' - for their inmate children by contributing a total
$40,000 to Pataki's 1994 campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Yoo was embraced by Republican Party as someone who
could deliver money and votes from Korean-American communities in
New York, New Jersey and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Yoo ''decided to put up for sale your state criminal justice
system,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Margaret Giordano told the jury.
Defense attorney Nicholas DeFeis countered that Yoo had ''no motive
or incentive to do this. ... He's just not that stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Donohue, the finance director for ''Friends of Pataki,''
testified as a defense witness that he never conspired with Yoo to
make deals with the contributors. On cross-examination, prosecutors
labeled Donohue a target of an ongoing investigation of alleged
influence peddling by Pataki aides.
</P>
<P>
   No one close to Pataki, including Donohue, has been charged. But
three former parole officials have either been indicted or
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   At trial, the prosecution argued that a paper trail of internal
memos showed that Donohue pushed for early release of donors'
children through a political ''pipeline'' connecting the governor's
office to the parole board. A former parole official testified that
the Division of Parole chairman - under pressure from governor's
office - ordered him to fix the case of Asian gang member John Kim.
</P>
<P>
   Kim was paroled in 1996 after his parents had arranged about
$9,000 in contributions to the Pataki campaign. The inmate had
served the minimum of a four-to-12 year sentence for a string of
armed robberies, including one involving the stun-gun torture of a
shop owner.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors alleged two other Korean-American couples
unsuccessfully sought to buy the freedom of their sons with
contributions - deals brokered by Yoo and Donohue. Yoo was
convicted of trying to convince one father to help him mislead
investigators.

<HEADLINE> 4 Sentenced For Vieques Trespassing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- A U.S. federal judge on Friday
sentenced four Puerto Rican independence activists to time served
for trespassing on U.S. Navy land on the island of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Salvador Casellas sentenced the four, who entered the area
to protest Navy bombing practice, to the 25 days they had already
spent in jail and ordered them released. In the past few weeks,
dozens of other activists have also been sentenced to time served
for trespassing and then freed.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has used Vieques, an island of 9,400 residents, as a
training ground for its Atlantic fleet since the 1940s. Years of
resentment over the shelling there turned to anger when a local
civilian guard was killed by two errant bombs on the range in April
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters started camping out on the range, preventing the Navy
from resuming exercises for a year until federal agents cleared
more than 200 people from the grounds during a raid May 4. A week
later, the Navy resumed exercises using non-explosive bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy can continue exercises with ''dummy'' bombs for another
three years. Islanders will decide in a referendum in coming months
whether the Navy can stay longer.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Deplore Japan Whale Hunting  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Japan, risking U.S. trade sanctions, will send
out ships Saturday to expand its research whaling operations, a
move critics called a cover for banned commercial whaling.
</P>
<P>
   The decision comes after the International Whaling Commission
passed earlier this month a resolution rejecting Japan's rationale
for expanding whaling. Commercial whaling also has been banned by
the IWC for almost 15 years, but a limited amount of whale hunting
for research purposes is still allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, a country that has hunted whales for thousands of years,
killed more than 400 minke whales last year. It wants to hunt
Bryde's whales and sperm whales as well.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's move brought rebuke from world leaders. British Prime
Minister Tony Blair and President Clinton sent letters to Japanese
Prime Minister Mori in June, urging Mori's government to abandon
the plan. Mori responded by saying Japan would wait until the July
meeting of the IWC to decide.
</P>
<P>
   The IWC decision, while backed by 10 nations, does not carry any
force of law.
</P>
<P>
   Roland Schmitten, an official at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration and the U.S. representative to the IWC,
said the science can be done without killing the whales, and also
doubted whether the scientific reasons were legitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very aggressive action on behalf of Japan,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to statements by Nobuyuki Yagi, first secretary at
Japan's embassy in Washington, the whale meat is sold on the market
after research is finished. He said the sales do not create any
profit for the nonprofit research institute. A message left seeking
comment was not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Whale meat is a delicacy in Japan, and oils from sperm whales
can be used for cosmetics and perfume.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wildlife Fund issued a statement calling for sanctions
against Japan, and said Japan's research is merely a ''guise'' in
order to expand a banned commercial whale hunt.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman P.J. Crowley confirmed that sanctions are
a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have at the highest levels expressed our opposition to the
expanded Japanese scientific whaling program. We have opposed it,
as have other members of the IWC,'' he said. ''We are disappointed
that the Japanese are moving ahead with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At its July meeting, the IWC also passed a resolution that could
lead to the resumption of some commercial whaling. The commission
called for a plan for limited whaling by February, which would
enable a vote at next year's annual meeting in London.

<HEADLINE> Rev. Graham Hopes To keep Preaching  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD N. OSTLING
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Health problems forced the Rev.
Billy Graham to miss a world conference he organized for 10,000
evangelists, but he hopes to continue preaching through 2002, his
son and designated successor Franklin Graham said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The doctors feel he can have a very productive ministry the
next couple years,'' the younger Graham told a press conference the
day before the ''Amsterdam 2000'' conference opened.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Graham, 81, is scheduled to hold a revival meeting in
Jacksonville, Fla., Nov. 2-5, and the younger Graham said his
organization is discussing events for 2001 and 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Graham will speak to the evangelists by satellite TV
Saturday night from Rochester, Minn., where he is undergoing
outpatient therapy at the Mayo Clinic after treatment for a
blockage of fluid to the brain. He also has Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   He plans to monitor the nine-day event by satellite and give
closing remarks Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Graham said Mayo Clinic doctors decided his father
should not interrupt his daily outpatient therapy to come to
Amsterdam. ''They don't think it's worth the risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Amsterdam conference is the last in a series of world
meetings Billy Graham has held for evangelical Protestants. The
Graham organization, based in Minneapolis, Minn., raised $40
million to stage the event.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin Graham is flying back to the United States to deliver
the closing prayer at the Republican Party convention Monday night.

<HEADLINE> Report: Albanians Flee Divided City  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Ethnic Albanians are fleeing
Serb-dominated neighborhoods of a troubled northern Kosovo city
following threats from local Serbs, a spokeswoman from a U.N.
relief agency said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''As more (ethnic Albanian families) leave that area, the few
that continue to remain are feeling increasingly under threat and
feeling the pressure to leave,'' said Paula Ghedini, spokeswoman
for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of them have been physically or verbally threatened,
while others have been summarily evicted from their homes,''
Ghedini said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Serbs were threatening their ethnic Albanian neighbors
on the northern side of the city, Kosovska Mitrovica. The problem
is exacerbated by displaced Serbs from other regions of Kosovo
moving into the Serb-dominated part of the city.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 2&AMP;frac12; weeks, 21 ethnic Albanian families have moved to
neighborhoods on the south side of the city, where ethnic Albanians
dominate, Ghedini said.
</P>
<P>
   Others have moved to the ''Little Bosnia'' district in northern
Kosovska Mitrovica, where there are few Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Ghedini appealed to the population living in the area to create
conditions that would allow minorities to remain in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The northern part of Kosovska Mitrovica is one of the few areas
in Kosovo where a large Serbian population remains.
</P>
<P>
   Most Serbs fled this overwhelmingly Albanian province after
NATO's 78-day air war to end the repression of ethnic Albanians by
forces loyal to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. Since the
bombing campaign last year, the remaining Serbs have frequently
complained of attacks by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovska Mitrovica is the only city in Kosovo where large
numbers of ethnic Albanians and Serbs still live near each other,
making it a flash point of ethnic tensions. Serbs see the city as
their last chance to maintain a viable Serb community in a province
they consider the birthplace of the Serbian nation.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Completes Genocide Census  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- A unique census intended to determine
exactly how may people were slaughtered in the 1994 Rwandan
genocide ended Friday, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-day count was carried out by a government-appointed team
of 1,600 workers who visited every family present in the country
between October 1990 and December 1994, said Protais Musoni, a
spokesman for the Ministry of Local Government and Social Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''These were the people who were present during the genocide
period, and they can talk about their own family members and
neighbors who were lost,'' Musoni said. He said the findings would
be tabulated and most likely published by October.
</P>
<P>
   At least 500,000 minority Tutsis and politically moderate Hutus
died at the hands of Hutu soldiers and militiamen during a killing
spree that began in April 1994 in this central African country. The
slaughter was orchestrated by an extremist Hutu government after
President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane was shot down on April 6 of
that year.
</P>
<P>
   The bloodbath ended three months later when Tutsi-led rebels of
the Rwandan Patriotic Front ousted the government and the army
fled.
</P>
<P>
   The precise figure of how many people were slain in 1994, or in
previous years of fighting, has never been known. Estimates range
from 500,000 to more than a million.
</P>
<P>
   As well as providing the government with a credible figure of
those killed, Musoni said the census findings would help Tutsis and
Hutus reconcile and would enable them to come to grips with the
causes of the genocide.

<HEADLINE> Gifford Exits 'Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee'  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- She's gone. No, really. Well, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Kathie Lee Gifford brought an end Friday to 15
years of chatter, camaraderie and controversy as Regis Philbin's
co-host on their morning talk show.
</P>
<P>
   With tears in her eyes, Gifford stood next to Philbin and
mouthed ''thank you'' to the audience, then comically covered her
face with a napkin.
</P>
<P>
   That was after Philbin raised a champagne glass and said,
''Bye-bye, sweetie.''
</P>
<P>
   And that was after he serenaded her with a special rendition of
''Thanks for the Memory,'' whose lyrics included, ''Your smile was
always sunny. You made a lot of money. You've come a long way since
you were just a 'Hee Haw' honey.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the others paying tribute during the hour were Michael
Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney Co., which owns the syndicated
show. He presented Gifford with an Emmy-like statue of Mickey
Mouse. There were also videotaped salutes from ''Late Show'' host
David Letterman and soap star Susan Lucci.
</P>
<P>
   A ''this is your life'' parade of clips from past shows included
Gifford's first appearance, on June 24, 1985, when she bounded onto
the set in a red dress and tennis shoes.
</P>
<P>
   During most of the hour, Gifford kept her emotions in check, but
during the last commercial break she strode up to an audience
member in the front row and pretended to chide her: ''Don't you
start crying! YOU go, I go!''
</P>
<P>
   It had been a week of celebrating Kathie Lee, both on her show
and off -- she crammed in appearances on seemingly every other talk
show, too.
</P>
<P>
   She even appeared on Thursday's ''Late Show'' to mock her own
post-Regis future by reading Letterman's Top 10 List: Things Kathie
Lee Will Do With Her Free Time (No. 1: Dave, can I crash here for a
while?).
</P>
<P>
   It was ''the most relentless, exhausting week in the history of
television,'' Philbin huffed to viewers at the top of Friday's
''Live.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, a chapter of TV history had ended.
</P>
<P>
   Well, sort of. Gifford confided to reporters after the broadcast
that she hoped to return sometime as a guest host.
</P>
<P>
   ''To think that I couldn't come back,'' she said, ''would
probably break my heart more than leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   When Philbin and Gifford began working together in 1985, their
morning show aired only in New York City. Their light mix of
celebrity chat and entertainment began each morning with Philbin
and Gifford riffing on the day's news or what they did the night
before -- and it caught on. The show went national in 1988, and
became a hit.
</P>
<P>
   During her years at Philbin's side, Gifford became one of the
nation's most popular -- and scrutinized -- television personalities.
She was the frequent target of shock jock Howard Stern and drew
criticism for her frequent chatter about her family.
</P>
<P>
   People loved -- or cringed -- hearing about son Cody's ''binkie''
and husband (and former football great) Frank Gifford's ''tight
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Gifford also became a target of labor activists when they said
her clothing line was produced in foreign sweatshops, after which
she pledged to work to end abuses in the apparel industry. Gifford
also went through the embarrassment of her husband's 1997 affair
with a flight attendant, allegedly set up by a tabloid.
</P>
<P>
   Gifford, 46, surprised viewers -- and Philbin -- when she
announced her departure on the air in February, saying she missed
singing and acting.
</P>
<P>
   She had recently performed a fill-in role in the Broadway
musical ''Putting it Together'' and days earlier had been a guest
host for Letterman's ''Late Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Philbin, 66, will carry on with substitute co-hosts, in
addition to his busy schedule as host of ABC's prime-time game show
sensation, ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire.'' The search for a
permanent replacement continues, but his wife, Joy, will be in
Gifford's chair Monday for the first edition of the interim-titled
''Live with Regis.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Gifford, she'll be hard at work on Monday, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll record the 10th out of 12 songs for my pop album,'' she
said. ''Life goes on.''

<HEADLINE> Russian Official Shrugs Criticism  </HEADLINE>
By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's foreign minister on Friday brusquely
dismissed U.S. criticism of Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq
Aziz's trip to Moscow, saying Russian officials will meet with
whomever they see fit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia is a sovereign and independent state, which itself
determines with whom and on what scale to maintain relations,''
Igor Ivanov said after meeting with Aziz in Moscow. ''We have and
will continue to maintain an intensive dialogue with Iraq.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. State Department spokesman had said Wednesday that
Russia, as a member of the U.N. Security Council, should not
receive senior Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz arrived in Moscow on Tuesday to rally Russian support for
Iraq's efforts to have U.N. economic sanctions against it lifted.
The sanctions were imposed as punishment for Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Since his arrival, Aziz has heaped praise on Russia -- and called
the United States a bully.
</P>
<P>
   ''Russia is making efforts to help strengthen peace and
stability and boost economic ties in the region, while the United
States carries out military aggression and foments disputes and
tension,'' Aziz said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   During talks with Aziz earlier this week, President Vladimir
Putin and other Russian officials reiterated Moscow's opposition to
continuing U.S. and British airstrikes against Iraq. The strikes
are aimed at enforcing no-fly zones imposed on Baghdad since the
end of Gulf War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ''We insist that the almost daily U.S. and British airstrikes on
Iraq be ended,'' Ivanov said. ''We also stand against meddling in
Iraqi internal affairs. Only political and diplomatic efforts, not
force, can bring a stable and fair peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia has pushed for the early lifting of sanctions against its
Soviet-era ally. It hopes that would allow Iraq to earn money by
selling oil and repay its multibillion-dollar debt to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russian companies have signed contracts with Iraq within
the framework of Iraq's U.N.-approved program to sell some oil to
buy food, and some of those companies have failed to get clearance
from the U.N. sanctions committee.

<HEADLINE> 7 Die in Latest Romania Heat Wave  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT H. REID
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- A heat wave sweeping southeastern
Europe has triggered forest fires in Greece and Bulgaria and caused
the deaths of at least seven people in Romania over the past three
days, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Evenimentul Zilei quoted the Bucharest ambulance
service as saying at least 25 people collapsed on the streets of
the Romanian capital Thursday. Temperatures there soared to 99
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people across the country died from heart attacks which
doctors believed were triggered by the heat, the Health Ministry
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In Bulgaria, authorities called out the army Friday to battle 69
fires raging across the country. The charred body of one person was
found near Ruse in northern Bulgaria. One person was hospitalized,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, more than 300 firefighters battled six blazes around
the country as temperatures soared to 104 degrees. July
temperatures for much of the Balkans normally swing from about 85
degrees to 95 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In the northern region of Grevena, 260 miles north of Athens,
about 100 firefighters assisted by four helicopters were trying to
extinguish a fire that broke out late Wednesday. The blaze had
burned about 250 acres of forest. Efforts to extinguish it were
hampered by high winds and unexploded bombs from World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Farther east, in Ioannina near the Albanian border, more than 50
firefighters and five helicopters battled another forest fire.
There were also fires outside Athens, near the port town of
Kalamos, and in the area around the central city of Larissa.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the fires were caused by hot temperatures, arid
conditions and high winds. Southeastern Europe has been gripped by
a heat wave for most of the week, with temperatures expected to
drop to normal over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Police investigate string of seven burglaries, two of them violent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A violent burglar on the Upper West Side who
left a 50-year-old woman critically injured Friday is suspected in
six other burglaries in the last month, police say.
</P>
<P>
   The burglar entered a couple's home on West 87th Street at about
2:30 a.m., waking Leonard and Madelyne Simon, said Lt. Steven
Biegel, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, 63, got up to investigate but was hit over the head as he
spotted the silhouette of a man holding a flashlight, Biegel said.
</P>
<P>
   His wife was then struck on the head and fell onto the bed. Both
were taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Hospital
spokesman Andrew Miller said Leonard was in stable condition and
his wife was in critical condition early Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Cheryl Cox, a police spokeswoman, said police were
seeking help from the public in the string of burglaries between
87th Street and 93 Street from West End Avenue to Central Park. The
burglaries began on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   She said the burglaries typically occur in the early morning in
apartments on the basement or ground floors.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said residents are typically awakened by sounds and if they
get up, he threatens them.
</P>
<P>
   The burglar apparently turned violent in the sixth burglary on
Monday on 93rd Street.
</P>
<P>
   In that instance, Nicholas Rotz, 78, and Wanda Rotz, 79, were
slashed and struck by someone who ransacked the apartment and stole
$300 before fleeing, Biegel said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was seriously injured but the woman's wrist was broken
and her husband's face was badly bruised, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police released a sketch of the suspect.

<HEADLINE> N.Korea's 'Godzilla' Flops in South  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea's movie version of
''Godzilla'' has all the right ingredients: a horned, scaly -- yet
sensitive -- monster, a love story and an abundance of cackling
villains.
</P>
<P>
   And the film, the first from the North to show in the democratic
South's cinemas, has an added boost -- the fact that the communist
country has recently come into vogue in South Korea. Excitement has
been running high since a June summit between the two countries'
leaders, the biggest step toward peace since the 1950-53 Korean
War.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ''Pulgasari'' has flopped at the box office in Seoul. Fewer
than 1,000 people in the city of 11 million saw the movie during a
weeklong run in five theaters that ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''My children are not interested,'' declared Park Il-man, 42,
pausing outside an empty cinema plastered with posters of
Pulgasari, which means ''Starfish'' in Korean. He said his children
prefer movies with better special effects, video games or comic
books.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean crowds cheered a visiting North Korean circus and
children's' art troupe. They marveled at the charm of North Korean
leader Kim Jong Il as summit host in Pyongyang. There was a flurry
of applications for permits to do business up North.
</P>
<P>
   But there's only gloom at the moviehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Made in 1985 with the help of Japanese technicians, Pulgasari is
as crude as the Japanese Godzillas of old. In early scenes, an
actor waddles around in a padded monster suit. The monster eyes
don't blink. The toothy jaw doesn't budge.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a barely disguised ode to North Korea's socialist
ideology, Pulgasari grows and vanquishes a royal army that is
oppressing a group of valiant farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Extras from the North Korean military, armed with studio spears
and swords, act out terror in front of a giant screen with a blurry
image of the monster. The acting is stilted, exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly an impressive display for South Koreans reared on
''Jurassic Park'' and other slick Hollywood blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean director of Pulgasari, Shin Sang-ok, sought
asylum in the United States in 1986 shortly before the film was
finished. Shin said he and his wife were kidnapped in the late
1970s and held for several years to make movies for Kim Jong Il, a
film buff. The couple were granted refuge in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il founded a film school in Pyongyang that has become a
routine tourist stop. Aside from a few movies based on legends or
old stories, most North Korean films advertise the totalitarian
government and its socialist creed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stars are those recognized by the Workers' Party as good
actors. They get paid more, live in better houses and sometimes
even have cars, which is very rare in the North,'' said Kim Hae
Young, a North Korean actress who defected to the South in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kim Jong Il watches every single film made in North Korea,''
she said. ''He gives comments on acting, directing and everything
else. If he compliments some actor, he or she suddenly becomes a
star.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's economic woes in recent years have drastically
curtailed moviemaking, according to people familiar with the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   A South Korean businesswoman, Kim Bo-ae, tried in 1990 and 1995
to collaborate on a movie with North Koreans, but both efforts
collapsed because of political tension.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a conciliatory climate on the Korean peninsula, Kim
Bo-ae plans to visit Pyongyang next month to discuss a new project
involving actors and scriptwriters from both Koreas.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea allowed a local distributor to screen Pulgasari as
part of efforts to promote cultural contacts with the North. The
movie made its international debut in 1998 in Tokyo, where it drew
respectable audiences.

<HEADLINE> Volunteer Kidnapped in Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By MARGARITA MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- A French volunteer for the Nobel
prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders has been
kidnapped in Colombia by leftist rebels, the Paris-based
humanitarian group said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteer, a laboratory technician for an aid project, was
seized Tuesday at a rural roadblock in northern Colombia, said
Guillermo Bertoletti, a spokesman for the group. Bertoletti did not
give the man's name.
</P>
<P>
   The guerrillas also took the man's jeep, which bore the insignia
of the organization. They stopped dozens of other motorists, but
only abducted the volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels freed the man's driver, telling him they would be in
communication with Doctors Without Borders on condition that it
publicize the abduction and ask the Colombian government not to
attempt a rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnappers have yet to issue any demands, Bertoletti said.
</P>
<P>
   Local residents said the kidnappers are from the Guevara
Revolutionary Army, an obscure dissident faction of the National
Liberation Army, Colombia's second-largest insurgency group.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders won the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize for its
work all over the world. Last year, the group evacuated 11 foreign
doctors and nurses from Colombia and suspended several health
projects after receiving threatening phone calls.

<HEADLINE> Dramatic rescue saves tourist from being swept over Niagara Falls  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - A tourist clung to a well-placed rock
in the middle of pounding rapids near the brink of Niagara Falls as
rescuers teetered across a fallen tree to reach him, parks police
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   John Dwyer, 30, of Newport, R.I., would have been swept over the
Falls in less than a minute had he lost his grip, New York State
Park Police said a day after the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was hanging on. I don't know how long he was there,'' Chief
Vincent Iacovitti said. ''He indicated to the officers he was there
a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer was treated for shock and exposure at Niagara Falls
Medical Center and later charged with reckless endangerment for
risking the lives of the officers who rescued him, as well as
disorderly conduct and obstructing governmental administration,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   He was arraigned Friday in Niagara City Court and was being held
on $1,000 bail. He was unavailable for comment at the city jail.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m. Thursday, Dwyer and his friend, David Boccuzzi of
Providence, R.I., decided to wade into the river off the northwest
shore of a grouping of islands that attracts thousands of tourists
daily.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can really get a perspective on the power of the rapids
there,'' Iacovitti said.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer apparently lost his footing and was swept through a small,
swift channel between two islands and shot out into the rapids,
where he found a rock below the surface of the water and held on.
</P>
<P>
   Niagara Falls is made up of three, separate falls: the Horseshoe
Falls, American Falls, and Bridal Veil Falls. Dwyer was in the
water above the Horseshoe Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Boccuzzi was able to get out of the water on his own.
</P>
<P>
   With a growing audience of tourists, a three-man rescue team
made its way across a tree that had fallen from Three Sisters
Island onto Little Brother Island to get close enough to throw a
line to Dwyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our officers had to go into the water to get closer. They tied
themselves on to do that,'' the chief said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he would have broken loose from that location there
wouldn't have been a whole heck of a lot we would have been able to
do,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Once rescuers had Dwyer secured in a basket, ''the trick was to
get him back over to Three Sister Island across the fallen tree
trunks,'' Iacovitti said. Rescuers accomplished that by sliding the
basket along the tree, which was about a foot in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   There are no fences keeping tourists from the water, but the
obvious power of the rapids is enough to keep most from venturing
in.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, said Iacovitti, ''there's always individuals out there
who like to experiment and explore.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Aide: Extradite Singer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's attorney general recommended
Friday that Mexican pop singer Gloria Trevi, her manager and an
associate be extradited to face charges of corrupting minors,
sexual abuse and rape, the Estado news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the late hour, no one was available at the attorney
general's office to confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   Trevi, manager Sergio Andrade and choreographer Maria Raquenel
Portillo were arrested in Rio de Janeiro on Jan. 13 and transferred
to Brasilia, the capital, on Feb. 10 to await a decision on their
extradition to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   On March 22, the three denied the charges in sworn depositions
before the supreme court. The court is expected to decide on
Mexico's extradition request sometime in August.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors from Mexico's Chihuahua state have accused the three
of corrupting 17-year-old Karina Yapor, whose parents had turned
her over to Andrade's care at age 12 for musical training --
allegedly at Trevi's behest.
</P>
<P>
   Yapor's family has accused Trevi of helping Andrade seduce Yapor
and other young girls. Yapor has denied she was mistreated.
</P>
<P>
   Trevi rose to fame in the late 1980s with a sexually flamboyant,
politically rebellious image. She spoke of someday running for
president and released a series of nude calendars that poked fun at
Mexican politics.

<HEADLINE> Exconvict who posed as middleweight boxer convicted of rape  </HEADLINE>
By SAMUEL MAULL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A sex offender who once posed as a top-ranked
middleweight boxer was found guilty of rape, kidnapping and other
charges Friday in connection with separate attacks on three women.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Lugo, 39, told the women he was Alex ''The Bronx
Bomber'' Ramos to lure them to hotel rooms, and he promised to pay
them $3,000 a night to be ''ring card girls'' between rounds at his
fights, testimony showed.
</P>
<P>
   But Assistant District Attorney Martha Bashford said Lugo's only
knockout punch was the spiked drink he gave his victims. She said
he would give them a beverage laced with a drug that left them
unconscious or nearly so.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo seemed surprised, squinting alternately at the jury and at
his lawyer Jose Muniz, as the verdict was read. The jury convicted
him of raping one woman, kidnapping two of them, and sexually
abusing the third.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo faces at least 50 years in prison - 25 years each for rape
and kidnapping, the top two counts - when State Supreme Court
Justice Bonnie Wittner sentences him on Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Montealegre, spokeswoman for the district attorney's
office, said Lugo was previously convicted on rape and sodomy
charges in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   The real Alex Ramos, who is 39, retired, and living in Simi
Valley, Calif., testified at Lugo's trial. He won several amateur
championships, fought professionally from 1980 to 1991, and lost
his only title fight.
</P>
<P>
   The former contender, who runs a foundation for retired boxers,
did not appear to be bitter toward Lugo. He said he knew him from
their old Bronx neighborhood where Lugo had been known as a
''wannabe'' hanger-on type.
</P>
<P>
   Muniz admitted that Lugo told women he was Ramos, but said he
used that as a pickup line in Lower East Side bars. He said the
women who went to hotels with him went voluntarily and any sex was
consensual.
</P>
<P>
   Bashford told the jury Lugo attacked his first victim on Sept.
15, 1998, when a 19-year-old young Long Island woman went to his
hotel room to ask about a job as a ring-card girl.
</P>
<P>
   She agreed to strip to her underwear so Lugo could preview how
she would look in a swimsuit she would have to wear. As she walked
around the room, the woman became ill. She believes the soft drink
Lugo gave her was drugged. When collapsed, Bashford said, Lugo
tried to rape her.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo's second victim was a 26-year-old department store employee
from Atlanta who had flown to New York to see friends. They went a
Lower East Side bar where she encountered Lugo.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was wearing his (Ramos) disguise, that night,'' Bashford
said. She said Lugo gave the woman his prizefighter line and kept
insisting that she drink a beer he had bought for her.
</P>
<P>
   The woman drank the beer, and the next thing she realized,
Bashford said, was that she was in ''a filthy, smelly room.'' When
she came to her senses, she was naked from the waist down and knew
she had been raped.
</P>
<P>
   The third victim was a 34-year-old costume designer who said
Lugo had assaulted her in a unisex bathroom in a bar on East Fifth
Street after she spurned his advances.

<HEADLINE> 'Big Brother' Writers Devise Twist  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Screenwriters Matt Allen and Caleb Wilson
found watching life on ''Big Brother'' a snore, so the pair devised
a plot twist to liven things up.
</P>
<P>
   Allen and Wilson tossed a tennis ball stuffed with fake news
stories -- including one in which President Clinton purportedly
called the CBS reality show a ''national disgrace'' -- into the yard
of the ''Big Brother'' house Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We decided to spice it up, throw a little wrench into the
system,'' Allen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The pair succeeded in creating a mini-drama: As contestants
investigated the ball, a ''Big Brother'' monitor warned them that
security had been breached and the contraband was to be
surrendered.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was seen on the 'round-the-clock Internet
transmission from the house, but CBS said Friday it had yet to
decide whether it would be included on the TV show. The contestants
were told the stories were a hoax.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a pathetic way to get attention,'' the network said in a
statement. ''Hopefully for them, their screenplay is more
creative.''
</P>
<P>
   The TV show, in which contestants are sequestered in a
camera-filled house for three months, is based at CBS Studio
Center. Allen and Wilson were on the lot Wednesday and noticed the
house and its 17-foot fence were unguarded.
</P>
<P>
   The pair, both 28, figured the information-deprived players were
ripe for a prank. The players are denied newspapers, radio and TV.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought it would be fun for them, fun for us, fun for the
show,'' Wilson said. ''We didn't want to do any serious damage,
just spark some conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend dummied up fake articles purportedly from the Los
Angeles Times. One of the false articles, which include profanity,
claimed that ousted contestant William Collins had signed a rap
record deal.
</P>
<P>
   Another article cited Clinton's purported outrage concerning the
show. ''How can these people, particularly the parents, abandon
their families and children for a chance at money and fame?'' said
one fake quote attributed to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Eight tennis balls were cut open, stuffed and thrown, but
apparently just one landed within bounds.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson and Allen, who said they cleared their prank with an
attorney, have not been contacted by CBS. The pair work in feature
films and are casting their first movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's one of the most creative things that's happened
on the show,'' Wilson said of the prank.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm waiting for the fruit basket (from CBS) when the ratings
go up,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the six-night-a-week ''Big Brother'' has earned
respectable ratings for CBS, it has yet to equal the network's
other reality show, the hit ''Survivor.''

<HEADLINE> Census director: Internal review finds no problems in 15 offices  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. (AP) - An internal review by the Census Bureau
found no evidence of fraud or improper procedures committed by
Census staffers in 15 offices around the country that were
scrutinized by a House Republican, the head of the agency said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''After a careful review of the operations of each of the
offices listed, I find no need for any further action,'' Kenneth
Prewitt said at a Census Bureau advisory panel meeting Friday in
Arlington, Va. ''None of them are out of line, or show any unusual
patterns.''
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt's comments came three days after Rep. Dan Miller,
R-Fla., said a review by his staff of records from the 15 offices
raised questions about the quality of work by enumerators trying to
track down some of the 40 million households that failed to return
a form.
</P>
<P>
   Some offices had ''surges'' of responses very early in that
operation, which began April 27, while others had questionable
surges toward the end of the operation, said Miller, chairman of
the House Government Reform Committee's census panel.
</P>
<P>
   Prewitt said he informed Miller by phone Thursday night of the
results of the internal review, and would provide a written report
to the subcommittee and media next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since we released our letter and our analysis, there have been
more news accounts independent of the subcommittee's work where
census enumerators say there was fraud and a rush to finish at the
sacrifice of quality,'' Miller's spokesman, Chip Walker, said
Friday. Walker said they have received separate letters of
complaints from current or former enumerators.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the questionable offices were in: Florence, Ala.;
west Atlanta; Chicago's far south and near north areas; Marion
County, Ind.; Las Vegas; Rapid City, S.D.; east Los Angeles,
Commerce and Santa Ana, Calif.; Newark, N.J.; the northwest section
of the Queens borough of New York City; the Upper East Side in the
Manhattan borough of New York City; New Castle, Del.; and north
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau finished follow-up visits to the 40 million
households a week before a July 7 deadline. Prewitt says that is
mainly because the other 80 million, or 66 percent, of the 120
million forms sent out were returned. The bureau budgeted for a 61
percent response rate this year, so overall, there were more
workers available to get cases completed.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau also considers responses collected as close to
April 1 as possible to be the most accurate. Census results are
officially a ''snapshot'' of the population from that date.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our highest priority is to correct any errors in the census,''
said Prewitt, adding that there are 150,000 cases around the
country where the Census Bureau has had to revisit homes, including
64,000 in Hialeah, Fla. because of procedural problems. ''To say we
need to recount 1 million homes across 15 offices is simply
inappropriate, incorrect and unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Framer, 38, said he worked as a census-taker the past
three months in Vineland, N.J. and New Castle. He said he informed
supervisors in both offices that other Census employees were
improperly filling in answers on forms after residents either could
not or would not answer them.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything was like rush, rush, rush, and it's not a case
where you can rush everything,'' said Framer, who left the job two
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Census spokesman Steve Jost said that quality control checks by
local, regional and national superiors showed nothing unusual in
New Castle.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no evidence of that,'' Jost said. ''We're confident
that quality control procedures unknown to enumerators would catch
such a problem.''

<HEADLINE> Brazil Pledges Billions For Poor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's government pledged Friday to
spend $6.7 billion over three years to fight poverty in the
country's poorest states.
</P>
<P>
   The funds -- to be dispersed over three years -- will help put
more children in school, supply all neighborhoods with water and
electricity and eliminate ''damaging forms of child labor'' in 14
northern and northeastern states, President Fernando Henrique
Cardoso said.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between the rich and poor in Brazil is among the widest

<HEADLINE> GOP Won't Moderate Abortion Policy  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Republicans turned aside an effort to
moderate their policy against abortion Friday night after
passionate debate on an issue that strains GOP unity more than any
other.
</P>
<P>
   The platform ''is meaningless if it doesn't stand for
something,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, who opposed giving
any ground to abortion-rights Republicans. ''Saving unborn children
is a very noble cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's platform committee voted Friday night to maintain
uncompromising language against abortion, leaving a vocal minority
on the other side searching for ways to press their case as the
Republican National Convention prepares to open Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidate George W. Bush decided months ago not to
rouse the religious right by taking it on over abortion.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Friday, as confusion mixed with emotion in the
debate, the platform committee voted to ''welcome people on all
sides of this complex issue and encourage their active
participation.''
</P>
<P>
   But because of the confusion in the way the motion was
presented, some who voted for that language -- Hyde among them --
thought they were voting against it. Another vote was held and the
motion went down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just think, we were welcomed for about 10 or 15 minutes,''
said Ann Stone of Republicans for Choice.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion rights advocates were exploring two main options:
including a minority report in the platform if they could get at
least 27 members of the 107-member platform committee to write one,
and bringing an abortion debate to the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   Each course is fraught with procedural hurdles but would be a
marked advance for advocates if achieved.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the views of Republicans who favor abortion rights were
relegated to an appendix that merely recited a series of failed
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
   The platform committee finishes debate on the document Saturday
and will vote to adopt it before sending it to the convention to be
ratified.
</P>
<P>
   An accommodation proving impossible on abortion, the party began
rallying behind other aspects of a platform that holds onto
conservative principles while shifting toward the center in tone
and a few policy areas, in keeping with Bush's ''compassionate
conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
   The party is set to drop its previous positions in favor of
eliminating the Education Department, making English the official
language and denying social services to immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   It favors a stronger federal role in environmental protection
than before.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's aggressive agenda on education was put to a test in
one platform subcommittee, which approved language saying the role
of the federal government ''must be progressively limited'' in that
area.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush also emphasizes state and local control of
education, his plans call for a strong federal presence and he
would use federal dollars to reward or penalize states according to
how well their students perform on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   The party is holding to its official view against same-sex
marriage and its contention that homosexuality is incompatible with
military service. Conservative committee members also added
language opposing special legal protections for gays.
</P>
<P>
   In opposing abortion and gay rights, the platform satisfies
social conservatives on the two issues most important to them, said
Gary Bauer, former candidate for the GOP nomination and longtime
activist from the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   ''In both those areas, the platform is very acceptable,'' Bauer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the full platform committee took up abortion, a panel
voted 10-3 against an attempt to strike abortion language from the
document altogether, and 11-3 against an amendment expressing
welcome for both sides on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The panel was carefully drawn to ensure views in favor of
abortion rights would be heard but would not prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-abortion Republicans constituted a clear majority, filled
both chairmen's seats and benefited from Hyde's high standing in
the party in opposing three little-known state party activists.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three voted down, Toni Casey of Los Altos Hills,
Calif., summoned Republicans to ''a historic opportunity'' to take
abortion out of politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can come together,'' she pleaded. ''We can adopt a platform
plank ... that unites us, not divides us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, countered that
abortion is necessarily political, not least because some abortions
are taxpayer-financed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's right up to its neck in politics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents brought to the table a letter from 11 Republican
members of Congress appealing to platform leaders not to pursue the
''totally unrealistic proposal'' to ban abortion by amending the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Howe of Louisiana, voting to keep the party's
anti-abortion policies intact, said on this issue there can be no
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm under the authority of the Creator of the universe,'' she
said. ''And he is pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the proceedings, conservative activist Phyllis
Schlafly, who lobbied platform leaders on abortion, welcomed the
outcome without sounding at all conciliatory in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're losers,'' she said of the abortion-rights activists.
''All they want to do is make trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The platform draft maintains the plank from the 1996 campaign
calling for a constitutional amendment that would ban abortion in
most if not all cases.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ''human life amendment'' favored by many
conservative Republicans would allow abortion only to save the life
of the woman, although that exception is not specified in the
plank.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also favors leaving abortion legal in cases of rape or
incest but is not pushing to have those exceptions spelled out in
the platform. His imperative has been to get the inevitable
abortion fight over with in a hurry.

<HEADLINE> Study Tracks Student Borrowing  </HEADLINE>
By ARLENE LEVINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four years after receiving their college diplomas, only 16
percent of student borrowers were debt-free, a federal study of
1993 graduates has found.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the Department of Education's first to track college
graduates' debt over time, began with 11,000 students nationwide
who completed bachelor's degrees in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Choy, an education consultant in Berkeley, Calif., used
the federal statistics and interviews to track student borrowing
from several sources, including family and friends, banks and loans
underwritten by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   About half of those surveyed -- 51 percent -- incurred debt
averaging $10,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, 39 percent were still paying off student loans
or had deferred payments while pursuing an advanced degree. The 16
percent without debt had paid their loans or had them forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Borrowers who earned only a bachelor's degree paid off their
loans at $151 a month, on average.
</P>
<P>
   Some debt grew, especially among the 29 percent of graduates who
later enrolled in graduate school or professional programs such as
law or medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Those who took loans and finished master's programs by 1997
carried an average debt of $17,200, and were paying $244 a month.
The debt averaged $66,200 for those who completed a professional
degree by 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Most students pursuing higher degrees deferred repayment while
in school. Among those who got only a bachelor's degree, 4 percent
had not repaid their debt for private, as well as federal, loans.
</P>
<P>
   Choy couldn't give a figure for federal loan defaulters among
that 4 percent, but she said it was statistically insignificant.
</P>
<P>
   College graduates tend not to default, because they can afford
to pay, Choy said Friday. ''That's really the bottom line.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a government report last fall, defaults on federal
loans to students were their lowest in more than a decade of
tracking: 8.8 percent in fiscal 1997, down from 9.6 percent the
year before. The loans go to students at more than 7,000 vocational
schools, college and universities.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent data available show federal student loans in
1999 totalled $42.9 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: Serbia a Threat to Peace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday that Slobodan
Milosevic's Serbia ''remains a threat to peace,'' and pledged
continued American help for Milosevic's political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he is encouraged by economic and political
reforms in the Balkans a year after 40 nations signed a ''stability
pact'' to rebuild Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said in a written statement, ''the last aggressive
dictatorship in Europe remains a threat to peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House released the statement in Boston, where Clinton
traveled for two Democratic fund-raising speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, the Serb president, remains in power more than a year
after the end of the NATO bombing campaign in Kosovo. The United
States and its allies launched the three-month air war to force
Serb troops to retreat from Kosovo and end its campaign of ethnic
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo is a province of Serbia whose population is predominantly
ethnic Albanian. Serb forces began expelling Kosovo residents from
their homes in large numbers early last year, creating a
humanitarian refugee crisis in neighboring nations.
</P>
<P>
   Most refugees returned quickly after the bombing stopped, but
the Serb rampage and the allied bombing left the province in
tatters.
</P>
<P>
   The stability pact has resulted in about $6 billion in
international aid so far this year, about 10 percent of it from the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Export-Import Bank has provided about $500 million to
back projects that use U.S. goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   This week, billionaire financier George Soros and the U.S.
Overseas Private Investment Corp. agreed to manage a $150 million
fund to spur private ventures in the Balkans and southeastern
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Lewis Dislcoates Elbow  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Jamal Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens'
first-round draft pick, will be sidelined 4-6 weeks after
dislocating his left elbow during Friday night's scrimmage with the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The running back from Tennessee was injured on a 1-yard run on
the Ravens' third offensive play during.
</P>
<P>
   A thunderstorm interrupted the scrimmage with the Ravens leading
3-0. Players were ordered off the field and the estimated 20,000
fans were told to seek safety in the enclosed concourses. Officials
said they hoped to resume play once the storm passed.
</P>
<P>
   Each team's offense had completed one set of plays under the
controlled scrimmage rules, and the Redskins had just begun their
second set, when the storm hit. The scrimmage featured reserves
almost exclusively, although the starters for both teams took part
in 7-on-7 drills beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins started three drives at their own 35-yard line
during their set of plays, and Chad Dukes' 23-yard run was the only
big gain. The final drive ended with an interception by Ravens
veteran safety Corey Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stover kicked a 30-yard field goal for the only score to
cap a Ravens drive. It was set up by a 17-yard pass from Trent
Dilfer to Billy Davis and a 20-yarder from Dilfer to Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens also got the better of the Redskins in the 7-on-7s.
Tony Banks threw back-to-back 20-yard touchdown passes to wide open
receivers, the first to Jermaine Lewis racing past Champ Bailey and
the second to Shannon Sharpe with Sam Shade trailing.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the field, the Redskins skill players
sputtered, with Brad Johnson throwing mostly short passes that fell
incomplete or for little gain. Backup Jeff George had the best
throw of the night, hitting Irving Fryar on a 20-yard sideline
pattern for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Darrell Green did not
take part. Green was absent following the death of his father
earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, nursing back spasms, practiced at Redskins Park
earlier. Sanders' one noticeable duty was bringing the water cart
onto the field during one drill.
</P>
<P>
   Absent for the Ravens was holdout draft pick Travis Taylor,
although his jersey number was evident on a fan's banner that read:
''C'mon 89, play fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins said they sold 45,000 tickets for the scrimmage and
the concert that followed, but the crowd appeared to be less than
half that number. Still, the scrimmage had some of the facets of a
real game, including a national anthem and frequent TV timeouts.

<HEADLINE> 5 Dead, 80 Injured at Fujimori Oath  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peruvians furious with the inauguration of
Alberto Fujimori as Peru's president set government buildings
ablaze Friday and chanted ''the dictatorship will fall!'' Tear gas
and smoke darkened skies over the capital as pitched street battles
left at least five dead and dozens injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators -- some peaceful, but others
throwing rocks and breaking windows -- filled the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the heavily guarded Congress building, a beaming Fujimori
ignored the unrest sparked by a May 28 re-election many said was
fraudulent and celebrated the beginning of an unprecedented third
five-year term. It was also his 62nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori wore the red-and-white presidential sash and raised his
arms in a victory sign as opposition congressmen shouted insults
and waved signs that read ''New Elections Now.'' As Fujimori began
his inaugural address, they walked out in protest of a vote tainted
by charges of widespread fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of two men, apparently security guards, were found in
the ashes of a state bank that was set ablaze, Fire Cmdr. Victor
Podesta said. Authorities said they later recovered three more
bodies from the building to bring the death toll to five.
</P>
<P>
   At least 80 more people -- police and demonstrators -- were
injured in the protests, four of them with bullet wounds, hospital
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those hurt was a bloody-faced foreigner with a press
badge who was taken away in an ambulance. Witnesses said he had
been hit in the face by a flying tear gas canister.
</P>
<P>
   As Fujimori swore to respect the country's constitution, riot
police outside fired bullets in the air and tear gas into the
crowds. A fire burned out of control in the lobby of the former
Education Ministry, one of the tallest office towers in downtown
Lima. Later, protesters' fires gutted a state bank building and the
building housing the National Elections Board.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke poured from the buildings and mixed with pungent
tear gas. At one point a fighter jet screeched overhead as
black-clad riot police and demonstrators battled on the streets
below. Some 40,000 police had been called out, and the office of
the human rights ombudsman said 80 people were detained.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest began to subside in the late evening, but some
scattered clashes continued after nightfall. Police used tear gas
to disperse lingering protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The violence was unusual in a region where peaceful democratic
elections have become commonplace. Smaller protests also erupted in
Arequipa, Peru's second-largest city, some 465 miles southeast of
Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's vow to protect the constitution provoked jeers from
opposition congressmen, who accuse him of violating it many times
during his decade in power. Others held a sign that read ''Majority
Bought,'' a reference to accusations Fujimori gained control of the
legislature by paying opposition congressmen to jump ship to give
his alliance a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The president pledged to ''strengthen democratic institutions
... and generate jobs and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   A peaceful protest had been called for by opposition candidate
Alejandro Toledo, who boycotted the May presidential runoff after
accusing Fujimori of planning to rig the results. He had vowed to
discredit Friday's inauguration by organizing an outpouring of
''peaceful resistance,'' but violence quickly erupted as
demonstrators marched toward Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo blamed the unrest on pro-Fujimori infiltrators sent to
discredit the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Peru does not want violence,'' said the 54-year-old
Stanford-trained economist.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators blocked firefighters trying to extinguish the
Education Ministry blaze, hurling long poles and shattering its
lobby windows as black smoke rose over the rooftop. The two sides
fought over fire hoses and firefighters pleaded with demonstrators
to let them combat the flames and allow three injured building
guards to be evacuated in ambulances. They got out.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon, hundreds reached the Plaza de Armas, the
465-year-old colonial heart of Lima. There they attacked the
National Palace -- the president's official residence -- hurling
rocks, breaking windows and chipping away at the concrete cornices
of the historic building. They set bonfires before police charged
out of side streets and drove them away with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   They also attacked the Palace of Justice, Peru's main court
building and a hated symbol of corruption for many Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1,500 of the protesters appeared to be trying to
break past police lines. Demonstration leaders urged people to stop
throwing rocks, but were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed troopers chasing demonstrators through
clouds of tear gas. Protesters fled into side streets, coughing and
choking. Some dropped to the ground and appeared to faint.
</P>
<P>
   The injured foreigner's face and head were covered in blood
after he was hit by the projectile that shattered his gas mask. He
was helped into an ambulance and taken away.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who identified herself as Lisbeth Hasse, a San Francisco
lawyer writing on Peru's pro-democracy movement for the Nation
magazine, identified the man as her assistant, Paul Vanotti. She
did not give details of his condition, but said he was talking.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's violence followed a peaceful rally Thursday by 80,000
Fujimori opponents. Throngs chanted ''Democracy, yes! Dictatorship,
no!'' and ''The dictatorship is going to fall!'' and held a red
banner emblazoned with the word ''DEMOCRACIA.''
</P>
<P>
   In a fiery speech Thursday night to kick off the protests,
Toledo said: ''We are going to rescue liberty and democracy from
the clutches of the dictator.''

<HEADLINE> Paulson's Horse Wins at Saratoga  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) -- Hap, bred by owner-trainer Allen
Paulson, who died last week, raced to a 1&AMP;frac12;-length victory Friday in
the $150,000 Bernard Baruch Handicap at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicable was second in a field of 13 3-year-olds and up, a
half-length better than Draw Shot.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the 4-year-old colt by Theatrical from the Hagley
mare, Committed, remained undefeated in three starts this year. His
clocking was 1:45:4 for 1 1/16 miles on the turf.
</P>
<P>
   In piloting Hap to the victory, Jerry Bailey was aboard his
third winner of the day. It was also the second time in its last
three runnings that Bailey rode the Baruch winner for trainer Billy
Mott.
</P>
<P>
   Bailey was aboard Yagli for his winning trip in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He broke Hap alertly from his outer post, then saved ground
behind Gone Fishin and Musical Ghost as they battled for the early
lead. Midway on the far turn, Bailey moved Hap to join and then
pass Musical Ghost, who had wrested the lead from Gone Fishin.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first stakes win for Hap, whose best previous effort
in stakes company was a second to Beckon the King in Gulfstream's
Steinlen Stakes last Nov. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Hap earned $90,000 and returned $9.20, $4.80 and $3.40.
Inexplicable paid $6.30 and $4.10. Draw Shot was $7.70 to show.
</P>
<P>
   The order of finish was completed by Royal Strand, End of the
Road, Holditholditholdit, Floriselli, Gone Fishin, Phi Beta Doc,
Val's Prince, Musical Ghost, Thesaurus and Mountain Ballad.

<HEADLINE> Chargers' QB Leaf Misses Practice  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- So much for Ryan Leaf getting through the first
10 days of practice unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf missed his second straight day of practice Friday because
his surgically repaired right shoulder was sore and stiff, proving
that winning back the San Diego Chargers' starting quarterback job
won't be a quick, painless process.
</P>
<P>
   While Leaf thinks he'll be ready to play in the exhibition
opener a week from Saturday at San Francisco, coach Mike Riley
isn't so sure. It's been 19 months since Leaf last played, and
Riley had a message for fans who want to see what kind of arm he
has after that long of a layoff.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell everybody that Jim Harbaugh's our starting quarterback
and Moses (Moreno) is a competitor and Ryan Leaf's the X-factor,''
Riley said. ''We don't know where he's going to be and we're going
to let that play out. That's really how I've envisioned it for
quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley huddled with Leaf, the second overall pick in the 1998
draft who had a disastrous rookie season, for a few minutes after
the morning practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt bad about missing time and felt he needed to be in
there,'' Riley said. ''I just told him to think of the long term
here. I told him, 'Think of a 15-year career, and think of one
practice now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just before camp started, Riley said he hoped Leaf could get
through the first 10-14 days without a setback that would sideline
him 2-3 days. That's exactly what this is.
</P>
<P>
   Riley wants to see Leaf play in the exhibition season, and now
knows the Chargers have to take it easy with him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the worst thing is to force him physically and have
him not feel good and then just prolong it,'' said Riley, who added
that it's natural that Leaf would feel pain after having two
surgeries since last July.
</P>
<P>
   The coach did let Leaf take some extra throws earlier this week.
''It might have screwed it up,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf threw a few passes during the warmup drill before the
afternoon practice and wanted to go, but the Chargers said no.
</P>
<P>
   ''The best thing about that is that he got over some soreness
and felt good enough to play again, and now he should realize that
soreness is natural, and because it's sore it's not a
catastrophe,'' Riley said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said his shoulder felt fine the first two days of camp, and
his passes were crisp and accurate. But after a day off Sunday, he
said it's been sore ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I felt real good this afternoon,'' Leaf said. ''I
wanted to go but they shut me down. Hopefully they have my best
interests at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf said his shoulder is ''just tired.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It tightens up pretty quick. I mean, I can get it loosened up
but it stiffens pretty quick if I don't go right away. It's kind of
tough when we go six reps for Jim, six reps for Moses and then me.
I've got to wait 12 plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf knows he's falling further behind the 36-year-old Harbaugh
and Moreno, who's made only one NFL start. But it also sounds like
he listened to Riley's little pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''At this point I feel like Jim and Moses are the guys who are
vying for it and I'm just trying to get my arm better. If the
opportunity presents itself, then I take advantage of it,'' Leaf
said. ''Right now we're just worrying about getting the shoulder
better and not about being on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaf tore shoulder cartilage 20 minutes into the first workout
of last year's training camp and had surgery. He missed the entire
season with the injury and a four-week suspension for cursing at
then-general manager Bobby Beathard. He had surgery again in
January to clean out the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Riley said TE Freddie Jones' dislocated finger is setting
back the offense. He could be out for up to a week. ... S Rodney
Harrison, already limited by a bruised right biceps, now has a
strained Achilles' tendon; G Kevin Gogan (ankle) probably won't
practice again until Monday; DE Al Fontenot (ankle) could be out
for a week; WR Curis Conway remains limited by a hamstring injury;
and TE Steve Heiden suffered a slight concussion. ... LB Eric Hill
will decide this weekend whether to retire or have surgery to
correct a bone spur on his spinal column.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Won't Be at Castle Pines  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MOSSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTLE ROCK, Colo. (AP) -- Tiger isn't coming.
</P>
<P>
   Fears by officials of The International that scheduling changes
might cause Tiger Woods to skip the event were realized on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has boomed some prodigious drives -- even by his standards
-- in the last two Internationals, but he won't be competing in this
year's tournament, set for next week at Castle Pines Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who has won three of the last four majors in dominating
fashion, has committed to play in the Buick Open on Aug. 10-13. He
has a lucrative contract with Buick that reportedly requires him to
play in a certain number of the four Buick-sponsored events on the
PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   The PGA championship is the following week at Valhalla Golf Club
in Louisville, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   Woods prefers to take at least one week off before each major
championship, so he'll skip The International.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked with his office and his secretary and was informed
that unfortunately because of his scheduling, he won't be with
us,'' International executive director Larry Thiel said Friday.
''It was, regrettably, a decision he didn't want to make. He made
the decision purely on scheduling.''
</P>
<P>
   While disappointed, Thiel added, ''One man does not make a
tournament. We still have a great field.''
</P>
<P>
   The confirmed entrants include Masters champion Vijay Singh,
Ernie Els, two-time International champion Phil Mickelson, David
Duval, Sergio Garcia, Steve Elkington, Notah Begay, Tom Lehman,
Justin Leonard and Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the top 10 players in the world rankings will compete
here: No. 2 Els, No. 3 Duval, No. 7 Mickelson and No. 9 Singh. And
six of the top 10 players on the PGA Tour money list are entered:
No. 2 Mickelson, No. 4 Els, No. 7 Lehman, No. 8 Duval, No. 9 Singh
and No. 10 Robert Allenby.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Charles Howell, the NCAA champion from Oklahoma
State who recently turned pro, is entered. David Gossett, the
reigning U.S. Amateur champion, is expected to make The
International his first professional event.
</P>
<P>
   Former winner Greg Norman, making a rapid recovery from minor
hip surgery, notified Thiel on Thursday that he, too, will be
playing.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt so strongly about playing that he called us out of the
blue and said he was coming,'' Thiel said. ''He said he has pushed
up his playing schedule, and said he was really hitting the ball
well.''

<HEADLINE> Oregon Mountain Biker Sends Message  </HEADLINE>

AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARK CITY, Utah (AP) -- Mountain bike rider Steve Larsen wasn't
picked to compete at the Sydney Olympics, and he wanted to let the
U.S. Cycling selection committee know how he felt about it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to dedicate this victory to that great committee that
left me off the Olympic team,'' Larsen said after dominating the
28-mile men's race on the National Off-Road Bicycle Association
professional mountain bike circuit Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen, of Jacksonville, Ore., won in two hours, 32 minutes, 27
seconds, almost five minutes faster than runner-up Pavel Tchekassov
of Russia, who finished in 2:37.16. Canadian Roland Green was third
at 2:39.08.
</P>
<P>
   As he approached the finish area, Larsen slapped hands with fans
lining the chute. He crossed the line and immediately dismounted,
then hoisted his bike over his head and yelled in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've said all along I'm riding at my best and I can beat these
guys by four or five minutes. That's exactly what I did today,''
Larsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen, 29, appealed the committee's decision after the team was
picked July 14. However, an independent hearing panel determined
last week the committee had followed its criteria in naming the
team.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Cycling director of athlete performance Sean Petty said the
panel determined the selection of Tinker Juarez over Larsen was ''a
very close call,'' but found no other action was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The panel reviewed the matter to ensure USA Cycling complied
with the selection process, not to determine which rider is
better,'' Petty said.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen's next appeal would be to the U.S. Olympic Committee.
After the race, he wasn't sure where his case stood with U.S.
Cycling.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd have to ask them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen won the gold medal at last year's Pan American Games and,
at 49th, he's the world's top-ranked American this year. Travis
Brown of Boulder, Colo., and Juarez of Downey, Calif., were given
the two Olympic slots.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen was the committee's first alternate. Hopeful of riding in
Sydney, he's not making any other plans for September.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe I'll end up there on the start line by the good graces
of you never know who,'' he said. ''I'm just going to go about my
business. I got myself back in the hunt for a national title. I'll
find a way to make a positive out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Larsen was favored by U.S. coach Stephane Girard, who said he
felt Larsen ''would have been the strongest in September.'' The
committee chose Juarez based on better results in the past two
years of World Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   ''Steve is a very talented, strong rider, but we've got to look
at results,'' Petty said. ''He had a lot of mechanicals
(breakdowns) and that's part of racing. Quite frankly, he needed a
knockout punch before now at the World Cup level.''
</P>
<P>
   Juarez didn't compete in Park City. Brown finished fourth in
2:41.15.

<HEADLINE> Peru Elections Turn Dark  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- It was President Alberto Fujimori's 62nd
birthday, his inauguration day for an unprecedented third term and
Peru's Independence Day.
</P>
<P>
   But as tear gas volleys crackled, Fujimori's scripted finest
hour turned into his darkest one: The largest opposition protest
against his decade in power and his tainted election victory
degenerated into pitched street battles.
</P>
<P>
   Some 1,500 club-brandishing students and hard-line workers
charged, and black-clad riot troopers countercharged throughout the
day. By late evening, five people were found dead in a burned-out
building and dozens were injured in the protests.
</P>
<P>
   While Fujimori attended a solemn Te Deum mass in Lima's downtown
Cathedral behind rings of riot police, water cannon trucks and
armored personnel transports, bedlam reigned blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   As Fujimori was sworn in to a third five-year term at the
120-seat Congress, hundreds of demonstrators ran pell mell down
streets. Vandals set bonfires in streets and the lobby of a
14-story public building.
</P>
<P>
   It began as some 1,500 rowdy demonstrators set off independently
of a largely peaceful march and tried to make their way to the
Congress. Four blocks shy of their goal, police stopped them.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators taunted the police, then charged their lines, and
the police responded with tear gas, firing directly into the
crowds, witnesses say. Gunshots also were heard being fired in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   Some protesters snatched flaming hot tear gas canisters, thrown
by police, and lobbed them back. They threw them on rooftops,
starting small fires.
</P>
<P>
   For hours in fits and bursts, the battle raged from one street
corner to the next, the tear gas canisters tracing an arcing plume
of smoke across an overcast sky before dropping into the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Many ran coughing, fainting and collapsing as homemade gas
masks, bought for as little as 30 cents, failed to work.
</P>
<P>
   As fire raged in the 14-story former Education Ministry, an
office tower, demonstrators wouldn't let firefighters approach at
first, tussling with them for control of water hoses.
</P>
<P>
   ''Please allow the ambulance in to let the injured out,'' said a
firefighter who helped evacuate three injured building guards.
</P>
<P>
   Vandals tried to use a stop sign as a battering ram against the
30-foot-tall wooden doors of the Palace of Justice, then lobbed
firebombs through the windows,
</P>
<P>
   Two opposition congress members, along with other opposition
leaders, tried to persuade protesters to stop hurling rocks. ''No!
No! No!'' Congresswoman Anel Townsend shouted.
</P>
<P>
   They ignored their leaders, and police fired tear gas again.
Protesters charged, pushing police back.
</P>
<P>
   Vandals then set fire to the 13-story Banco de la Nacion and the
six-story building across the street containing the National
Elections Board, which supervised the election that many say was
rigged in Fujimori's favor.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 4, Marlins 1  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- All Curt Schilling did in his first start for the
Arizona Diamondbacks was pitch them back into first place.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, acquired Wednesday from the Philadelphia Phillies in
a five-player trade, allowed six hits in eight innings Friday to
help beat the Florida Marlins 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who began the game one percentage point behind
San Francisco, took a half-game lead in the NL West over the
Giants, who beat Chicago 2-0 earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins beat Atlanta's Greg Maddux on Thursday, but they
couldn't do much against Schilling (7-6) and lost for the sixth
time in seven games. The three-time All-Star struck out Preston
Wilson with the bases loaded to end the fifth. Right fielder Danny
Bautista caught Wilson's fly at the wall with a man on in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling struck out five, walked two and allowed one run. Since
June 16, the right-hander is 6-2 with a 1.90 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Mantei struck out the side in the ninth for his seventh
save in nine chances.
</P>
<P>
   Reid Cornelius (3-5) lost his third consecutive start despite
allowing only one earned run in 6 2-3 innings. An error by former
Arizona shortstop Andy Fox gave the Diamondbacks two unearned runs
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's Luis Castillo delivered a run-scoring single in the
fifth, extending his hitting streak to 19 games and earning his
seventh RBI in 323 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins scored in the fifth but left the bases loaded. Ramon
Castro singled, took second on a sacrifice and scored with two out
when Castillo singled. Mark Kotsay reached on an infield single and
Cliff Floyd walked to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   But Schilling struck out Wilson on three pitches to end the
inning, then punched the air with his fist in jubilation. The
strikeout gave Wilson 129, and he remains on pace to break Bobby
Bonds' major-league record of 189 set in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista singled and scored on Matt Williams' two-out double to
give Arizona a 1-0 lead in the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks made it 3-0 in the fifth. Erubiel Durazo
singled and Damian Miller walked, and both advanced on Schilling's
sacrifice. With two out, Fox failed to make a backhanded grab on a
high-hopper by Tony Womack, and two runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Fox was starting for Alex Gonzalez, who went on the disabled
list Friday with a strained knee.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Ryan, pinch hitting for Schilling in the ninth, doubled home
Arizona's final run.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Floyd, who has been bothered by a sore knee, pulled up
limping as he reached second base with a double in the fourth.
After being examined by a trainer, Floyd stayed in the game, but he
left for a pinch runner in the eighth. ... The meeting was the
first this season between the former expansion teams. Arizona leads
the series 15-3. ... Arizona had two runners erased on the bases in
the third. Schilling doubled off the wall but was picked off
second. Womack singled but was thrown out trying to steal.

<HEADLINE> Reds 8, Expos 3  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit his 14th career grand slam
and Sean Casey extended his career-best hitting streak to 19 games
as the Cincinnati Reds beat the Montreal Expos 8-3 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Elmer Dessens (5-0) won his fourth straight start since joining
the rotation following the All-Star break as the Reds snapped a
three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, making his first career appearance at Olympic Stadium,
hit his 32nd homer with the bases loaded in the second off Mike
Johnson (5-5) for his second grand slam of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The grand slam tied Griffey with Gil Hodges and Robin Ventura
for ninth in career grand slams.
</P>
<P>
   Casey hit a two-run double in the first for Cincinnati's longest
hitting streak since Hal Morris hit safely in 29 straight games in
1996. He also singled in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Taubensee went 4-for-5, barely missing a home run with two
outs in the seventh as his drive landed on top of the right-field
wall and bounced back for a double.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal lost its fourth straight following a four-game winning
streak. The Expos have lost 14 of their last 20 home games,
including four of five.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds got out to a 6-0 lead on Casey's first-inning double
and Griffey's grand slam in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Dessens allowed just one hit -- Vladimir Guerrero's leadoff
single in the second -- through the first four innings before
allowing a run on three straight singles by Geoff Blum, Chris
Widger and Tomas De La Rosa leading off the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson allowed six runs and eight hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati scored an unearned run in the sixth off reliever
Felipe Lira as center fielder Milton Bradley turned the wrong way
on Griffey's drive to center and dropped the ball on the warning
track for his first major league error. Chris Stynes, who had
doubled, scored from second to make it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos scored two in the seventh to draw to 7-3 on
consecutive RBI grounders by pinch-hitters Fernando Seguignol and
Wilton Guerrero.
</P>
<P>
   Dessens allowed three runs and seven hits in seven innings. He
struck out two and walked one.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young added an RBI double off reliever Steve Kline in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Griffey was greeted by a warm ovation from the crowd of
11,547 as he batted in the first. ... Casey, who entered the game
tied with Young for the longest Reds hitting streak this season, is
29-for-71 (.408) with four home runs and 17 RBIs during the streak.
... Cincinnati RHP Scott Sullivan dropped his appeal of the
three-game suspension imposed on him July 19 for hitting Colorado's
Brian Hunter with a pitch. ... Expos 1B Lee Stevens returned to the
starting lineup after missing the last seven games with a bruised
right hand.

<HEADLINE> Indians Obtain Wickman From Brewers  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Desperate for pitching to get back into the
pennant chase, the Cleveland Indians obtained closer Bob Wickman
and starters Steve Woodard and Jason Bere from the Milwaukee
Brewers on Friday for a package including slugger Richie Sexson.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Sexson, the Brewers got rookie right-handers Paul
Rigdon and Kane Davis and a player to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Indians general manager John Hart announced the deal during a
news conference at Jacobs Field. He also said the Indians were
working the phones in hopes of adding more players before Monday's
trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know that we're through yet with our deals,'' Hart
said. ''We're still looking to maybe acquire some other pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those pieces was outfielder Wil Cordero, who came back to
Cleveland in a deal with Pittsburgh. According to sources familiar
with the trade who spoke on the condition they not be identified,
the deal was not immediately announced because a player going to
Pittsburgh was in the Indians' game Friday night at Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries ravaging its pitching staff, Cleveland, which has
won five straight AL Central titles, has struggled all season and
began Friday in second place, 10&AMP;frac12; games behind division-leading
Chicago and three games behind Oakland in the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard and Bere will immediately move into the Indians starting
rotation, Hart said, replacing Charles Nagy and Jaret Wright, who
are both on the disabled list and may not be back until September.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be able in one trade to replenish 30 percent of your
pitching staff is a good deal for us -- not only for the 2000 season
but with pieces that are going to be able to play for us beyond
2000,'' said Hart, who came close to getting Curt Schilling from
Philadelphia last week before the Phillies traded their ace to
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Wright will pitch two innings in a rehab start at Triple-A
Buffalo on Saturday while Nagy, who had surgery earlier this
season, has been transferred to the 60-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Bere will start Saturday's game in Baltimore and Woodard will
make his debut on Tuesday in Tampa, said Hart, who has also had to
juggle Manny Ramirez's contract situation in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Wickman, selected to the NL All-Star team earlier this month,
has 16 saves. The 31-year-old, who is signed through 2001, is 2-2
with a 2.93 ERA in 43 games, all in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can be a setup man or a closer,'' Indians manager Charlie
Manuel said. ''Right now he's going to be our closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wickman, a Wisconsin native, was disappointed by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trade hurts, that's all I can say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It might also hurt the fans who planned to come to County
Stadium on Saturday to receive their free Bob Wickman posters.
</P>
<P>
   Bere, a 29-year-old right-hander who is eligible for free agency
after the season, is 6-7 with a 4.93 ERA in 20 starts. Woodard, a
25-year-old right-hander, is 1-7 with a 5.96 ERA in 11 starts and
16 relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited about the opportunity to get to Cleveland and have
a chance to possibly get to the postseason,'' Bere said.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson, 25, became a regular starter in 1999 and hit .255 with
31 homers and 116 RBIs. But the 6-foot-8 Sexson, who is more
comfortable playing first base than the outfield, slumped this
season to a .256 average with 16 homers and 44 RBIs. He has 96
strikeouts in 324 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is no secret that we have been trying to acquire another
bat for the middle of our lineup,'' Brewers GM Dean Taylor said.
''Anytime you have the ability to acquire a player coming off a
31-home run, 116-RBI season last year, you certainly have to be
delighted with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexson, wildly popular with Indians fans, joins a list of young
players like Jeromy Burnitz, Brian Giles and Sean Casey the Indians
have traded in the past few years while trying to win their first
World Series title since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ''On one hand it's good that we've been able to develop players
that are attractive to other clubs,'' Hart said. ''Richie has
upside and it's going to be a good opportunity for Richie and a
very, very difficult deal for us. He has a chance to be a 30-homer
guy every year. He's going to go on and have a nice career.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 25, made his major league debut last month and is 0-3
with a 14.73 ERA in two starts and three relief appearances,
pitching a total of 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon, 24, was sent to the minors when Davis was brought up on
June 28. Rigdon was 1-1 with a 7.64 ERA in five games for the
Indians, who had brought him up from Triple-A Buffalo on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   They were just two of six pitchers who to make their major
league debuts this season for the Indians, who have already set a
franchise record by using 27 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives our club an opportunity to right itself and to play
meaningful games in August and September which is what we promise
our fans every year,'' Hart said. ''We've had tremendous injuries
but this is still a team we all believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, 28, was hitting .282 with 16 home runs and 51 RBIs in
89 games as the Pirates' starting left fielder. He played last year
in Cleveland, hitting .299 with eight homers and 32 RBIs in a
season shortened by a broken left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said Sexson's departure would not effect Ramirez's
situation. On Wednesday, Ramirez's agent, Jeff Moorad, rejected a
five-year, $75 million contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians insist that Ramirez is not on the trading block.

GOP Won't Moderate Abortion Policy
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Republicans turned aside an effort to moderate their
policy against abortion tonight after passionate debate on an issue that strains
GOP unity more than any other. The platform ''is meaningless if it doesn't stand
for something,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, who opposed giving any ground
to abortion-rights Republicans. ''Saving unborn children is a very noble
cause.'' The party's platform committee voted tonight to maintain uncompromising
language against abortion, leaving a vocal minority on the other side searching
for ways to press their case.

Study Tracks Student Borrowing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Four years after receiving their college diplomas, only 16
percent of student borrowers were debt-free, a federal study of 1993 graduates
has found. The study was the first for the Department of Education to track
college graduates' debt over time. The study's author, Susan Choy, an education
consultant in Berkeley, Calif., used federal statistics and interviews to track
student borrowing from several sources, including family and friends, banks and
loans underwritten by the federal government. About half of those surveyed -- 51
percent -- incurred debt averaging $10,000 each. Four years later, 39 percent
were still paying off student loans or had deferred payments while pursuing an
advanced degree.

complaint that the president gave misleading testimony during the Paula Jones
sexual harassment case and is no longer fit to be a lawyer. The president's
response had been due Aug. 1. The state's prosecutor said she didn't object to
the delay, so long as the proceedings can be wrapped up by the end of the year.

Seven Die in Romania Heat Wave
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- A heat wave sweeping southeastern Europe has
triggered forest fires in Greece and Bulgaria and caused the deaths of at least
seven people in Romania over the past three days, officials said Friday. A
newspaper quoted the Bucharest ambulance service as saying at least 25 people
collapsed on the streets of the Romanian capital Thursday. Temperatures there
soared to 99 degrees. Seven people across the country died from heart attacks
which doctors believed were triggered by the heat. In Bulgaria, 69 fires raged
across the country, and in Greece, there were six blazes.

   BOSTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday that Slobodan Milosevic's Serbia
''remains a threat to peace,'' and pledged continued American help for
Milosevic's political opponents. The president said he is encouraged by economic
and political reforms in the Balkans a year after 40 nations signed a
''stability pact'' to rebuild Kosovo. Still, he said in a written statement,
''the last aggressive dictatorship in Europe remains a threat to peace.''

<HEADLINE> L.A. Cop Is Charged in Scandal  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA DEUTSCH
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A former partner of the police officer who
ignited a corruption scandal last year was charged Friday with
attempted murder and armed robbery, the most serious charges in the
investigation so far.
</P>
<P>
   Five officers now face prosecution for alleged corruption in the
anti-gang unit at the police department's Rampart station, and more
than 20 officers have left active duty.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Nino Durden, 32, was arrested in the shooting of a gang
member who is now paralyzed and the robbery at gunpoint of a
suspected drug dealer. Charges also include filing false police
reports and committing perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Durden once partnered with Rafael Perez, who told investigators
last year that he and other officers beat, framed and robbed people
in rough neighborhoods west of downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Durden's lawyer, Darryl Mounger, said his client is innocent and
denounced Perez as a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Perez began cooperating with investigators in exchange for a
lenient sentence after he pleaded guilty to stealing cocaine from
an evidence room.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Gil Garcetti said Durden wouldn't have been
charged without corroboration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always known that any case based on the testimony of
Officer Perez would be very difficult to sustain in front of a
jury,'' Garcetti said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the scandal, nearly 100 criminal cases have been
dropped or convictions overturned.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a police commission review panel asked the
department's 9,300 officers to complete an 11-page questionnaire to
gauge rank-and-file opinion on department problems.
</P>
<P>
   Durden was charged with attempting to kill 23-year-old gang
member Javier Francisco Ovando in October 1996. Ovando was
convicted of assault and served three years of a 23-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The original police report said Perez and Durden were staking
out an apartment building when Ovando burst into a dark apartment
and pointed a rifle at them. The report said Ovando was ordered to
drop the gun, and both officers shot him when he did not comply.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview of Perez by prosecutors that was obtained by the
Los Angeles Times, Perez said he never saw Ovando with a gun and
that Durden quickly left the shooting scene and returned with a
sawed-off rifle that he dropped next to Ovando.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he recognized the weapon as one the officers had
seized previously.
</P>
<P>
   Ovando on Friday was rolled into a new conference at his
lawyer's office with his 3-year-old daughter, Destiny, in his lap.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking through a translator, he said he hoped Durden will
receive justice and ''for all the damage he's done to everyone,
life (in prison) would probably be appropriate.'' He said he hoped
the trial will bring out ''the truth about all the bad things that
were done.''
</P>
<P>
   ''God is doing justice now. Why should I be angry now?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The six-count complaint also charged Durden with second-degree
robbery, alleging he stole jewelry and money from Grace Cox, whom
the officers suspected of dealing drugs, in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Durden also was charged with perjury under oath in the case of
Miguel Hernandez, who was convicted of a weapons violation in 1996
and served eight months in prison.

<HEADLINE> White Sox Pick Agrees to Terms  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Outfielder Joe Borchard, the first-round pick of
the Chicago White Sox in last month's draft and the 12th selection
overall, agreed to a contract Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox said his signing bonus was the largest for a
first-round pick in this year's draft and the most ever given to a
White Sox pick but didn't specify the amount.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Camarillo, Calif., the 6-foot-4, 225-pound
switch-hitter batted .333 with 21 home runs for Stanford this
spring. He also was a quarterback on Stanford's football team.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are thrilled to have reached this agreement with Joe,''
general manager Ron Schueler said. ''He is an impressive hitter and
showed us a great deal of power from both sides of the plate. We
continued to talk with him throughout the summer, and with football
beginning in earnest soon, everyone felt it was time for the
negotiations to reach a positive conclusion.''

<HEADLINE> Mets 3, Cardinals 2  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Al Leiter ended a personal three-game losing
streak Friday night as the New York Mets defeated the St. Louis
Cardinals 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Mets' fourth straight victory and their fourth
straight win against the Cardinals, leaders of the National League
Central Division.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (11-4), held St. Louis hitless over the first five
innings, retiring 15 of the first 16 batters and 11 in a row over
one stretch. He allowed three hits, struck out eight and walked two
in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever John Franco gave up a pair of singles in the eighth
bringing on Turk Wendell, who picked Jim Edmonds off first base.
Third baseman Lenny Harris' fourth error in two days allowed a run
to score before Wendell struck out Eric Davis to end the inning.
Armando Benitez worked the ninth for his 24th save.
</P>
<P>
   Loser Pat Hentgen (9-8) gave up all three Mets runs in the
second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza opened with a single and Todd Zeile walked. Benny
Agbayani's double off the wall in right center-field scored Piazza.
Then Zeile scored on Jay Payton's grounder to second with Agbayani
taking third on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Kurt Abbott followed with a fly ball to center field. Agbayani
tagged up and scored when catcher Mike Matheny dropped Edmonds'
throw for an error.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals nicked Leiter for a run in the sixth. Matheny led
off with a single, St. Louis' first hit of the game, and moved up
on a sacrifice by Hentgen. Fernando Vina also bunted, moving
Matheny to third. Then Placido Polanco delivered the run with a
two-out single to center. Leiter ended the rally by getting Edmonds
on a line drive to left.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, St. Louis loaded the bases with one out on a
single by Davis, a walk to Ray Lankford and an error by Abbott.
Leiter struck out Matheny and got pinch hitter Craig Paquette on a
soft liner to second.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets loaded the bases with one out in the bottom of the
seventh. But reliever Matt Morris struck out Zeile and tossed
Agbayani's broken-bat dribbler to Matheny for a force at the plate
and the final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Mets are 15-5 in games started by Leiter. ... The
Cardinals, completing a stretch of 17 of 20 games on the road since
the All-Star break with visits to New York and Montreal, did not
check into their Manhattan hotel until 5 a.m. ... Mets 3B Robin
Ventura is expected to come off the DL (bruised right rotator cuff)
for Saturday's game. ... The Mets also expect trade acquisitions SS
Mike Bordick, RHP Rick White and OF Bubba Trammell to report
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Labor Leaders Call Strike  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Labor leaders said Friday they will call
a three-day national strike next week to protest the government's
lack of action against violence on white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions, representing 90 percent
of organized labor here, said it will ask members to stay home
starting Wednesday ''out of concern over lawlessness throughout the
country.'' The decision was made at a Friday meeting of the
federation's general council of member unions, said the
organization's acting president, Isaac Matonga.
</P>
<P>
   Matonga asked President Robert Mugabe to end the violence, which
has already claimed 32 lives, most of them white farmers or
Mugabe's political opponents. ''There's no law in this country,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some white farmers and agricultural industries were preparing to
stop working Monday to protest the violent farm occupations, but
the labor federation asked them to hold off until Wednesday. ''To
have an impact, we have got to do it together,'' Matonga said.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, more than 1,600 white-owned farms have been
occupied by ruling party-backed militants.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe has described the occupation as a justified demonstration
against unfair land ownership by the nation's tiny white minority,
which holds a third of the productive land. But political opponents
accuse the president of having allowing the unrest to bolster his
flagging support among landless rural poor.
</P>
<P>
   Violence and intimidation by the farm squatters has disrupted
production of food and cash crops across Zimbabwe, hurting the
already ailing economy.

<HEADLINE> Mosque Foundation Files Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A group of Muslims is suing a Chicago suburb,
accusing the city council of conspiring to prevent it from
converting a vacant Christian church into a mosque.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal lawsuit filed Friday, the group accuses the Palos
Heights City Council of religious discrimination and breach of
contract. The lawsuit seeks $3.5 million in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations stem from the council's plan to pay the Al Salam
Mosque Foundation $200,000 to drop its building plans.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation agreed to take the money, but the deal fell apart
last week when the mayor vetoed the payout, calling it ''an
insult'' to the community's Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   Four aldermen have insisted they offered the payment so the city
could buy the church and convert it into recreation space.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has divided residents in this mostly Christian town of
about 12,000 people. About 450 Muslim families live in the
community.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 2, Phillies 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Darren Dreifort took a no-hit bid into the
sixth inning and led the Los Angeles Dodgers to their fifth win in
six games, 2-0 over Philadelphia on Friday night in Omar Daal's
Phillies' debut.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (7-7) allowed Mickey Morandini's two-out double in the
sixth, a soft liner just inside the third-base line, and Scott
Rolen's single leading off the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort pitched seven innings, extending his streak of shutout
innings to 18. Mike Fetters and Jeff Shaw completed the two-hitter,
with Shaw getting three outs for his 16th save in 23rd chances.
</P>
<P>
   Daal (2-11), acquired from Arizona in Wednesday's Curt Schilling
trade, made his first start since July 2 and was done partly by a
defensive lapse. Daal, traded from Los Angeles to Montreal five
years ago, struck out a season-high seven in five innings, allowing
two runs and six hits.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles loaded the bases in the third when Mark Grudzielanek
singled and Shawn Green and Gary Sheffield walked. Eric Karros hit
a high popup between shortstop Desi Relaford, Rolen at third and
Daal, but none of them tried to catch the ball and it fell for an
RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre followed with a single to right that scored
another run, but Bobby Abreu threw out Sheffield at the plate. The
Dodgers star injured his left knee during the collision with
catcher Tom Prince but remained in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia got just two runners past second.
</P>
<P>
   Morandini was hit by a pitch leading off the fourth, stole
second and took third on a wild pitch, but Dreifort struck out
Abreu, retired Rolen on a popup and struck out Pat Burrell.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen singled in the seventh and Burrell walked, but
pinch-hitter Rico Brogna hit into a 6-4-3 double play and Kevin
Jordan grounded out.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Beltre made a nice pickup on Travis Lee's leadoff grounder
to third in the sixth inning. Lee also was acquired in the
Schilling trade and made his Phillies debut as a defensive
replacement in left in the sixth. Lee was 0-for-2. ... Phillies RHP
Paul Byrd will have surgery on his right shoulder on Wednesday and
will miss the rest of the season. ... Dodger Ps Eric Gagne and Onan
Masaoka were optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque to make room for Ps
Ismael Valdes, acquired on Wednesday in a trade with the Cubs, and
Gregg Olson. The team also transferred OF Geronimo Berroa
(fractured left foot) from the 15-day to 60-day disabled list. ...
The Schill-O-Meter, constructed by a fan who kept track of Curt
Schilling's strikeout total during the game in the left-field
seats, was crossed out and replaced by the Daal-O-Meter. ... It was
the Dodgers' fourth shutout of the season and the fourth time
Philadelphia was blanked. ... Cincinnati beat Philadelphia with a
two-hitter on May 2.

<HEADLINE> Ravens' Lewis Dislocates Elbow  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANDOVER, Md. (AP) -- Jamal Lewis, the Baltimore Ravens'
first-round draft pick, will be sidelined 4-6 weeks after
dislocating his left elbow during Friday night's scrimmage with the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   The running back from Tennessee was injured on a 1-yard run on
the Ravens' third offensive play, his first live tackle play as a
pro against another team. Lewis was carrying the ball in his right
arm and was trying to use his left to keep his momentum going when
a defender rolled over it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was broke,'' Lewis said. ''I'd never felt that
kind of pain before. Luckily, it was just dislocated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis walked to the sidelines, where trainers popped the elbow
back into place.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Brian Billick said Lewis was having a great training camp
and should be back in time for the Sept. 3 regular season opener at
Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was picking up the system and catching the ball well,''
Billick said. ''His speed jumps out at you.''
</P>
<P>
   But the time missed will be crucial for a rookie expected to
work his way into the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ''I keep saying, if we didn't need to do this, we wouldn't,''
Billick said. ''We'd get up in the morning, have a meeting or two,
go play golf and come back and show up for the opener. You need
that for timing, you need to get a feel for the system.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrimmage was cut short when a thunderstorm hit with the
Ravens leading 3-0. Players were ordered off the field and the
estimated 20,000 fans were told to seek safety in the enclosed
concourses. Officials hoped to resume play, but the storm lingered
and the coaches decided it would be unsafe to continue.
</P>
<P>
   Each team's offense had completed one set of plays under the
controlled scrimmage rules, and the Redskins had just begun their
second set, when the rain began. The scrimmage featured reserves
almost exclusively, although the starters for both teams took part
in 7-on-7 drills beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins started three drives at their own 35-yard line
during their set of plays, and Chad Dukes' 23-yard run was the only
big gain. The final drive ended with an interception by Ravens
veteran safety Corey Harris.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stover kicked a 30-yard field goal for the only score to
cap a Ravens drive. It was set up by a 17-yard pass from Trent
Dilfer to Billy Davis and a 20-yarder from Dilfer to Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   The Ravens also got the better of the Redskins in the 7-on-7s.
Tony Banks threw back-to-back 20-yard touchdown passes to wide open
receivers, the first to Jermaine Lewis racing past Champ Bailey and
the second to Shannon Sharpe with Sam Shade trailing.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the field, the Redskins skill players
sputtered, with Brad Johnson throwing mostly short passes that fell
incomplete or for little gain. Backup Jeff George had the best
throw of the night, hitting Irving Fryar on a 20-yard sideline
pattern for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Redskins cornerbacks Deion Sanders and Darrell Green did not
take part. Green was absent following the death of his father
earlier Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, nursing back spasms, practiced at Redskins Park
earlier. Sanders' one noticeable duty was bringing the water cart
onto the field during one drill.
</P>
<P>
   Absent for the Ravens was holdout draft pick Travis Taylor,
although his jersey number was evident on a fan's banner that read:
''C'mon 89, play fair.''
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins said they sold 45,000 tickets for the scrimmage and
the concert that followed, but the crowd appeared to be less than
half that number. Still, the scrimmage had some of the facets of a
real game, including a national anthem and frequent TV timeouts.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Makes Indigenous Rights Forum  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. member states have decided to create
a permanent U.N. forum on indigenous rights that will give native
peoples their first high-level representation in the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials called Friday's decision historic, noting that
indigenous people have been seeking representation on the
international level since they approached the League of Nations in
the early part of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The forum ''promises to give indigenous peoples a unique voice
within the United Nations system, commensurate with the unique
problems which many indigenous people still face, but also with the
unique contribution they make to the human rights dialogue,'' U.N.
High Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   The forum, a standing 16-person committee, will be a subsidiary
body of the U.N. Economic and Social Council. The Economic and
Social Council is one of the main organs of the United Nations
after the Security Council and General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Half the representatives to the forum will be nominated by
governments. The other half will be appointed by the president of
the Economic and Social Council after consulting with a broad range
of indigenous groups.
</P>
<P>
   Indigenous leaders have been campaigning for a U.N. Declaration
on the Rights of Indigenous People to affirm that indigenous
peoples have a right to self-determination and to return to their
lands. They say their campaign has run into strong opposition from
the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

<HEADLINE> Athletics Get Mecir From Tampa Bay  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics shored up their
bullpen Friday, acquiring setup man Jim Mecir and a minor leaguer
from the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for two minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics, who also acquired Triple-A left-hander Todd
Belitz, sent right-hander Jesus Colome -- one of their top prospects
-- and a player to be named to Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt the need to improve our bullpen,'' A's general manager
Billy Beane said. ''In the case of Jim Mecir, he's someone we've
had our eye on for quite some time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mecir will join Jeff Tam as the main setup men for All-Star
closer Jason Isringhausen. The A's started the day three games
behind Seattle in the AL West and in the wild-card lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mecir was taken aback by the trade, but encouraged by the A's
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just think it's a disruption in your life,'' Mecir said. ''I
think it's great that I'm going to a team that's in the race. Any
time you make a move after being in one spot it's a little
nerve-racking.''
</P>
<P>
   Mecir, a sidearming right-hander, has been one of the most
effective middle relievers in the American League this season. He
was 7-2 with one save and a 3.08 ERA in 38 games for the Devil
Rays.
</P>
<P>
   He has stranded 19 of 21 inherited runners -- the best ratio in
the AL -- and opponents are batting .201 against him, fifth among AL
relievers. He holds lefties to a .205 average.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think after being here for three years, I love playing here
and I love the guys on the team, so yeah, I would like to have
stayed here and seen it through,'' Mecir said.
</P>
<P>
   Beane said he wanted to make a deal that would be good for the
A's of the present as well as the future. Mecir is arbitration
eligible at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at some of our wins it was starter, Tam,
Isringhausen; starter, Tam, Isringhausen,'' Beane said. ''We needed
to get to a point where there were more options.''
</P>
<P>
   Beane admitted, however, that giving up Colome stung.
</P>
<P>
   Colome spent this season at Double-A Midland where he was 9-4
with a 3.59 ERA in 20 starts. He was signed by the A's as a
non-drafted free agent in 1996 out of the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to put some stock into this season,'' he said. ''It
wouldn't be fair to the players here now.''
</P>
<P>
   Belitz has spent the season with Triple-A Durham where he is 1-1
with two saves and a 3.83 ERA in 43 appearances. He has allowed
just one home run in 47 innings.

   Anderson was the NFL's second-leading rusher in 1998, but a
season-ending knee injury last September was a big part of the
Falcons' tumble from 14-2 and the Super Bowl to 5-11 last year.
</P>
<P>
   He has practiced, but he might not play Saturday night against
the Indianapolis Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ''We haven't talked about it, but I really don't think he'll
play,'' Atlanta coach Dan Reeves said. ''I'd like to keep him out
the first couple of (preseason) games, and have him fully ready for
the third game. But he's impatient, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, who underwent surgery, said the knee feels ''pretty
good.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just in a situation of working through the soreness,
taking it day by day. I'm trying to keep it strong, not push it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Colts are looking to prove last year was no fluke.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis went from a 3-13 record in 1998 to 13-3. Edgerrin
James was the NFL rushing leader and the league's offensive rookie
of the year, Peyton Manning emerged as one of the top young
quarterbacks in the NFL, and Marvin Harrison had a Colts-record
1,663 yards receiving.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the five preseason games, I'll have plenty of opportunity
to get prepared for the season,'' Manning said. ''My guess is that
I will not play a lot early on and I will progressively get more
playing time as we get closer to opening day.
</P>
<P>
   ''You want everyone to be healthy for the start of the season,
but at the same time, you want to get in there and get things going
smoothly.''
Ravens:
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Lewis, Baltimore's first-round draft pick, will be
sidelined 4-6 weeks after dislocating his left elbow during Friday
night's scrimmage with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The running back from Tennessee was injured on a 1-yard run on
the Ravens' third offensive play, his first live tackle play as a
pro against another team. Lewis was carrying the ball in his right
arm and was trying to use his left to keep his momentum going when
a defender rolled over it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was broke,'' Lewis said. ''I'd never felt that
kind of pain before. Luckily, it was just dislocated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis walked to the sidelines, where trainers popped the elbow
back into place.
Broncos:
</P>
<P>
   Holdout defensive tackle Trevor Pryce headed home to Florida on
Friday after failing to agree to a new contract with Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expected a protracted holdout, Lamont Smith, Pryce's
Denver-based agent, said, ''I think that would be a safe assumption
at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Broncos owner Pat Bowlen said the team's seven-year, $31.5
million offer that includes a $6 million signing bonus is the final
offer.
</P>
<P>
   Pryce, 24, is in the fourth year of a five-year, $4.9 million
contract that will pay him $762,000 in base salary this season. He
played sparingly as a rookie in 1997 but blossomed into an All-Pro
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Broncos coach Mike Shanahan said yielding to Pryce's request
would set a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's looking for a $51 million contract,'' Shanahan said. ''We
told him that obviously we weren't going to go in that direction.
If I do, I've got everybody on this football team holding out,
wanting better deals.''
Cowboys:
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, which plays Pittsburgh at home Sunday night, is not only
looking for a new kicker and new punter -- the team has to find
somebody to hold for extra points and field goals, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tight end Eric Bjornson, who handled holding duty last season,
went to the New England Patriots as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Coming in, I was more worried about the holder than the
kicker,'' Cowboys kickers coach Steve Hoffman said.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever punter stays with the team is the likely choice for
holder.
Chargers:
</P>
<P>
   Third-string quarterback Ryan Leaf, the second overall draft
pick in 1998, missed his second straight practice Friday morning
because his surgically repaired right shoulder was sore and stiff.
</P>
<P>
   While Leaf, who hasn't played in 19 months, thinks he'll be
ready for the exhibition opener next Saturday at San Francisco,
coach Mike Riley isn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tell everybody that Jim Harbaugh's our starting quarterback
and Moses (Moreno) is a competitor and Ryan Leaf's the X-factor,''
Riley said. ''We don't know where he's going to be and we're going
to let that play out. That's really how I've envisioned it for
quite a while.''
Saints:
</P>
<P>
   Saying his heart wasn't in it, center Justin Burroughs left
training camp, choosing early retirement over another three weeks
of trying to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs, 24, who played college football at North Carolina
State, missed all of last season with a foot injury. After a
successful stint in NFL Europe last spring, Burroughs had battled a
neck injury over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said his heart wasn't in it,'' coach Jim Haslett said.
''It's hard to play this game if you really don't have the heart to
play. But he decided he just wasn't into it.''
Giants:
</P>
<P>
   Second-year running back Joe Montgomery, who developed high
blood pressure over the past few days, was given a clean bill of
health after undergoing a complete physical Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel said Montgomery will play Saturday in the
Giants' scrimmage at the University at Albany.
Rams:
</P>
<P>
   The second day of St. Louis' practice with Tennessee was tough
on two of its highly touted rookies.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Kaulana Noa will be out about six weeks with a
broken left wrist that may be dislocated, and running back Trung
Canidate, the team's first-round pick, will be sidelined at least
two weeks with a high ankle sprain.

<HEADLINE> Tight End Released in Assault Probe  </HEADLINE>
By GENE JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- University of Washington tight end Jerramy
Stevens, who had been jailed overnight for investigation of sexual
assault, was freed Friday after prosecutors said they needed more
time to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was not charged and was freed without conditions, King
County prosecutor's spokesman Dan Donohoe said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a police report and search warrant return obtained
by KIRO-TV, Stevens was under investigation in an apparent drugging
and sexual assault of a 19-year-old woman after a June 3 party at
the UW's Sigma Chi fraternity.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority, told police she
talked with Stevens at the party, drank from a possibly tampered
bottle, then awoke in her own room the next afternoon wearing just
her T-shirt and a bra, which was around her waist, the police
report said.
</P>
<P>
   She said her pants were on the floor and a fleece jacket,
bloodstained and covered with dirt, was in the room. Her mother
found her underwear in a nearby parking lot, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   A 911 call that night reported a possible rape in progress in an
alley, but police were unable to find the people involved. The
witness told the operator it appeared the woman was nearly
unconscious, according to court documents.
</P>
<P>
   A blood sample was taken from Stevens, KIRO reported.
</P>
<P>
   A six-member SWAT team arrested Stevens early Thursday at his
home about five miles from the university, police spokesman Clem
Benton said. Benton said it was routine for a SWAT team to serve a
warrant in such a case.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, held Thursday night in the King County Jail, had been
scheduled for a bail hearing Friday but instead was released. He
was not immediately reachable for comment, but a bailiff confirmed
he had left the jail Friday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors needed more time to investigate, Donohoe said.
Prosecutors can hold a person for just 72 hours before charging him
or releasing him.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, a 6-foot-7, 250-pound tight end, is entering his third
year at Washington. He redshirted his first year and last season
caught 21 passes for 265 yards and four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with two counts of assault in a June 1998 fight
at a park in suburban Olympia, about 60 miles south of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens pleaded guilty to misdemeanor fourth-degree assault for
kicking a man in that case. He spent three weeks in jail that
summer after a drug test administered under terms of his house
arrest turned up THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

   CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Tari Phillips and Vickie Johnson scored 15
points apiece Friday night as the New York Liberty beat the
Charlotte Sting 66-56.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Conference-leading Liberty (16-10) won their third
straight and ninth in 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips grabbed 11 rebounds, and Johnson had 10 for a
double-double. Tamika Whitmore had 13 points for New York.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Smith led the Sting (7-19) with a career-high 17
points. Andrea Stinson was held to 13 points on 6-of-15 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   New York's starting frontcourt outscored Charlotte's 43-9 and
outrebounded them 22-7.
</P>
<P>
   Neither team led by more than four points in the first half
until a barrage of 3-pointers by Smith and Stinson helped the Sting
to its largest lead of the game at 28-20.
</P>
<P>
   New York came storming back to score the final seven points of
the half and cut the Sting's lead to 28-27 at halftime.

<HEADLINE> 4 Dead, 80 Injured at Fujimori Oath  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peruvians furious with the inauguration of
Alberto Fujimori as Peru's president set government buildings
ablaze Friday and chanted ''the dictatorship will fall!'' Tear gas
and smoke darkened skies over the capital as pitched street battles
left at least four confirmed dead and dozens injured.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of demonstrators -- some peaceful, but others
throwing rocks and breaking windows -- filled the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the heavily guarded Congress building, a beaming Fujimori
ignored the unrest sparked by a May 28 re-election many said was
fraudulent and celebrated the beginning of an unprecedented third
five-year term. It was also his 62nd birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori wore the red-and-white presidential sash and raised his
arms in a victory sign as opposition congressmen shouted insults
and waved signs that read ''New Elections Now.'' As Fujimori began
his inaugural address, they walked out in protest of a vote tainted
by charges of widespread fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of two men, apparently security guards, were found in
the ashes of a state bank that was set ablaze, Fire Cmdr. Victor
Podesta said. Authorities said they later recovered two more
bodies. Independent Radioprogramas reported a fifth victim spotted
in the debris, but authorities said they could not confirm that.
</P>
<P>
   At least 80 more people -- police and demonstrators -- were
injured in the protests, four of them with bullet wounds, hospital
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One of those hurt was a bloody-faced foreigner with a press
badge who was taken away in an ambulance. Witnesses said he had
been hit in the face by a flying tear gas canister.
</P>
<P>
   As Fujimori swore to respect the country's constitution, riot
police outside fired bullets in the air and tear gas into the
crowds. A fire burned out of control in the lobby of the former
Education Ministry, one of the tallest office towers in downtown
Lima. Later, protesters' fires gutted a state bank building and the
building housing the National Elections Board.
</P>
<P>
   Black smoke poured from the buildings and mixed with pungent
tear gas. At one point a fighter jet screeched overhead as
black-clad riot police and demonstrators battled on the streets
below. Some 40,000 police had been called out, and the office of
the human rights ombudsman said 80 people were detained.
</P>
<P>
   The unrest subsided in the late evening, but some scattered
clashes continued after nightfall. Police used tear gas to disperse
lingering protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The violence was unusual in a region where peaceful democratic
elections have become commonplace. Smaller protests also erupted in
Arequipa, Peru's second-largest city, some 465 miles southeast of
Lima.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's vow to protect the constitution provoked jeers from
opposition congressmen, who accuse him of violating it many times
during his decade in power. Others held a sign that read ''Majority
Bought,'' a reference to accusations that Fujimori gained control
of the legislature by paying opposition congressmen to jump ship
and give his alliance a majority.
</P>
<P>
   The president pledged to ''strengthen democratic institutions
... and generate jobs and prosperity.''
</P>
<P>
   A peaceful protest had been called for by opposition candidate
Alejandro Toledo, who boycotted the May presidential runoff after
accusing Fujimori of planning to rig the results. He had vowed to
discredit Friday's inauguration by organizing ''peaceful
resistance,'' but violence quickly erupted as demonstrators marched
toward Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In a nighttime news conference after the violence abated, Toledo
blamed the unrest on what he said were dozens of pro-Fujimori
infiltrators sent to discredit the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fujimori has been inaugurated behind the tanks and rifles
because he does not have the support of the people,'' said the
54-year-old Stanford-trained economist.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said ''the peaceful resistance will continue,'' though he
did not elaborate on steps he would take.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, demonstrators blocked firefighters trying to extinguish
the Education Ministry blaze, hurling long poles and shattering its
lobby windows as black smoke rose over the rooftop. The two sides
fought over fire hoses and firefighters pleaded with demonstrators
to let them combat the flames and allow three injured building
guards to be evacuated in ambulances. They got out.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of protesters reached the Plaza de Armas, the
465-year-old colonial heart of Lima. There they attacked the
National Palace -- the president's official residence -- hurling
rocks, breaking windows and chipping away at the concrete cornices
of the historic building. They set bonfires before police charged
out of side streets and drove them away with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   They also attacked the Palace of Justice, Peru's main court
building and a hated symbol of corruption for many Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 1,500 of the protesters appeared to be trying to
break past police lines. Demonstration leaders urged people to stop
throwing rocks, but were ignored.
</P>
<P>
   Television footage showed troopers chasing demonstrators through
clouds of tear gas. Protesters fled into side streets, coughing and
choking. Some dropped to the ground and appeared to faint.
</P>
<P>
   The injured foreigner's face and head were covered in blood
after he was hit by the projectile that shattered his gas mask. He
was helped into an ambulance and taken away.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who identified herself as Lisbeth Hasse, a San Francisco
lawyer writing on Peru's pro-democracy movement for the Nation
magazine, identified the man as her assistant, Paul Vanotti. She
did not give details of his condition, but said he was talking.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's violence followed a peaceful rally Thursday by 80,000
Fujimori opponents. Throngs chanted ''Democracy, yes! Dictatorship,
no!'' and held a red banner emblazoned with the word
''DEMOCRACIA.''

<HEADLINE> Brewers 5, Rockies 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP)-- Jamey Wright pitched seven scoreless innings and
Ron Belliard hit a two-run triple, lifting the Milwaukee Brewers
over the Colorado Rockies 5-0 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, after climbing back into the NL West race, has tumbled
right out, losing 19 of 23 overall and 10 straight on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Wright (6-4) allowed six hits, Ray King pitched the eighth and
David Weathers finished the eight-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Astacio (8-7), just 2-6 in his last 12 starts, allowed
four runs and six hits, striking out nine and walking one.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the Brewers traded right-handers Jason Bere,
Bob Wickman and Steve Woodard to Cleveland for first-baseman Richie
Sexson, right-handers Paul Rigdon and Kane Davis and a player to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Belliard's triple capped a three-run second inning as Milwaukee
took a 3-0 lead. Jeromy Burnitz drew a leadoff walk and Tyler
Houston followed with a single. Jose Hernandez singled home
Burnitz, and Belliard followed with a triple into the right-field
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Burnitz, who went 2-for-3, made it 4-0 in the third with his
21st homer, a two-out solo shot. He added an RBI single in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had runners on first and third with no outs in the
third, but Wright escaped when left fielder Geoff Jenkins threw out
Brent Mayne at home on Tom Goodwin's fly deep into foul territory
for a double play and Neifi Perez grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado had runners on first and third with one out in the
sixth, but Wright retired Jeffrey Hammonds and Todd Helton on
groundouts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Jenkins, who left in the eighth after being hit in the
elbow by reliever Mike Myers, recorded his 10th assist when he
threw out Mayne at home. Jenkins is day to day. ... Wright won for
just the second time in seven starts since June 24. ... Just one of
Milwaukee's seven shutouts was a complete game.

Study Tracks Student Borrowing
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Four years after receiving their college diplomas, only 16
percent of student borrowers were debt-free, a federal study of 1993 graduates
has found. The study was the first for the Department of Education to track
college graduates' debt over time. The study's author, Susan Choy, an education
consultant in Berkeley, Calif., used federal statistics and interviews to track
student borrowing from several sources, including family and friends, banks and
loans underwritten by the federal government. About half of those surveyed -- 51
percent -- incurred debt averaging $10,000 each. Four years later, 39 percent
were still paying off student loans or had deferred payments while pursuing an
advanced degree.

country of erecting unfair barriers to competition in its $12 billion
telecommunications market. While U.S. telecommunications companies applauded the
action, Mexican government officials and Telmex, the country's dominant phone

complaints by AT&AMP;T and other American firms that the Mexican government and
Telmex are conspiring to keep foreign companies out of the market by maintaining
high interconnection rates and through other anti-competitive regulations.

JFK Airport Gunman Surrenders

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Security officials at John F. Kennedy Airport had to explain
today how an armed man got past a checkpoint and onto a plane, where he put a
gun to a pilot's head and began a five-hour standoff. Brandishing a gun, the
22-year-old man went around a metal detector, ran the past the security check in
front of the plane's gate Thursday night and boarded a National Airlines Boeing
757 about to leave for Las Vegas, police said. He pointed a gun at the pilot's
head and asked to be flown to Miami, Argentina or Antarctica, witnesses and
authorities said. The 143 passengers and crew on the plane were able to leave
unhurt before the gunman was arrested. The incident raised questions about
whether one of the world's busiest airports has sufficient security checks in

second-best gymnast in the U.S. until a devastating knee injury
last year at nationals, his injury proved too much to overcome this
soon. He finished 18th.
</P>
<P>
   The only real pressure on Wilson came from Sean Townsend, the
1997 junior champion who, according to his biography, believes he
will peak in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But even that challenge ended early, when Townsend slipped off
the pommel horse, landed on the mat, wobbled forward and nearly
fell on his face. The 21-year-old Texan finished with 113.975
points, a full x1.7 behind America's preeminent gymnast.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hamm of Wisconsin finished third and Stephen McCain of
Texas fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The top 14 gymnasts advance to the Olympic trials in August,
where their scores will be combined to determine four spots on the
Olympic team. Two others will be chosen by the men's committee.
</P>
<P>
   Barring some disastrous turn, Wilson is in. He became the first
gymnast to win five straight national titles since George Wheeler
did it from 1937-41.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's performance started slow, but gained lots of steam.
After dropping a full twist from a 1&AMP;frac12;-twist tumbling pass on the
floor routine, he came off muttering obscenities. He scored a 9.05.
</P>
<P>
   Next, his pommel horse routine netted a 9.65.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he reached his favorite apparatus, the rings, where he put
in his second sterling performance of the meet. Moving from the
planche position, with legs perfectly parallel with the ground, he
pushed up on the rings to bring his feet over his head, a pair of
perfectly aligned angles the judges clearly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a 9.95 on rings, then nailed his vault landing and
showed his first signs of levity this week, giving a coy little
grin to the sidelines and a nice two-handed wave to the cheering
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The fans spent the most of the rest of the time gasping at
mistakes that came from seemingly everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The most drastic might have come from Roethlisberger, a
30-year-old seeking a berth in his third Olympics. On the floor, he
bailed out of the 1&AMP;frac12;-twist on his second tumbling pass -- the same
one he had trouble with Wednesday -- settling for a half-twist and
the penalty that came with it. He scored an 8.75.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, on the pommel horse, he lost his grip and had to
jump off. He finished the routine cleanly, but scored an 8.65, then
ripped the tape off his hands and threw it at the trash can.
</P>
<P>
   He scored a 9.725 to close the night on the parallel bars --
flexing his muscles after the dismount and shouting in joy into a
television camera. But the damage on his scorecard had already been
done. He started the night in sixth place and only moved up one
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton also had problems. After a floor routine in which he
stumbled on a tumbling pass and lost his balance on the final
landing, he jumped off the mat and slammed a chair when it was
over.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who exceeded expectations were the 17-year-old Hamm
and his twin brother Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hamm didn't post a score of less than 9.275 the entire
meet. His best performance Friday came on the high bar, where he
gave three sharp, short fist pumps after his dismount, a flawless
full-twisting double layout.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Hamm's final routine came on the vault, where he stuck
his landing and ran over to coach Stacy Maloney with a big grin,
knowing an eighth-place finish and a trip to the trials was secure.
</P>
<P>
   Gatson, meanwhile, had only one score over a 9. Strangely, it
came on the high bar, which is where his right knee buckled at last
year's nationals, an accident that cost him the lead, the victory
and ultimately, a trip to the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Indians send Sexson to Brewers  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Desperately trying to get back into the pennant
chase, the Cleveland Indians made three deals Friday that got them
three new pitchers and two new hitters.
</P>
<P>
   First, the Indians obtained closer Bob Wickman and starters
Steve Woodard and Jason Bere from the Milwaukee Brewers Friday for
slugger Richie Sexson, rookie right-handers Paul Rigdon and Kane
Davis and a player to be named.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Indians brought back outfielder Wil Cordero, who became
a free agent after last season, acquiring him from Pittsburgh for
outfielder Alex Ramirez and infielder Enrique Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Topping off the night, the Indians got first baseman David Segui
from Texas for Ricky Ledee, acquired just last month by Cleveland
from the Yankees in the David Justice trade.
</P>
<P>
   Indians general manager John Hart announced the Milwaukee deal
during a news conference at Jacobs Field. Cleveland's game at
Baltimore was rained out later Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   With injuries ravaging its pitching staff, Cleveland, which has
won five straight AL Central titles, has struggled all season and
began Friday in second place, 10&AMP;frac12; games behind division-leading
Chicago and three games behind Oakland in the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard and Bere will immediately move into the Indians starting
rotation, Hart said, replacing Charles Nagy and Jaret Wright, who
are both on the disabled list and may not be back until September.
</P>
<P>
   ''To be able in one trade to replenish 30 percent of your
pitching staff is a good deal for us -- not only for the 2000 season
but with pieces that are going to be able to play for us beyond
2000,'' said Hart, who came close to getting Curt Schilling from
Philadelphia last week before the Phillies traded their ace to
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Wright will pitch two innings in a rehab start at Triple-A
Buffalo on Saturday while Nagy, who had surgery earlier this
season, has been transferred to the 60-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Bere will start Saturday's game in Baltimore and Woodard will
make his debut on Tuesday in Tampa, said Hart, who has also had to
juggle Manny Ramirez's contract situation in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Wickman, selected to the NL All-Star team earlier this month,
has 16 saves. The 31-year-old, who is signed through 2001, is 2-2
with a 2.93 ERA in 43 games, all in relief.
</P>
<P>
   ''He can be a setup man or a closer,'' Indians manager Charlie
Manuel said. ''Right now he's going to be our closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wickman, a Wisconsin native, was disappointed by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trade hurts, that's all I can say,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It might also hurt the fans who planned to come to County
Stadium on Saturday to receive their free Bob Wickman posters.
</P>
<P>
   Bere, a 29-year-old right-hander who is eligible for free agency
after the season, is 6-7 with a 4.93 ERA in 20 starts. Woodard, a
25-year-old right-hander, is 1-7 with a 5.96 ERA in 11 starts and
16 relief appearances.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited about the opportunity to get to Cleveland and have
a chance to possibly get to the postseason,'' Bere said.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson, 25, became a regular starter in 1999 and hit .255 with
31 homers and 116 RBIs. But the 6-foot-8 Sexson, who is more
comfortable playing first base than the outfield, slumped this
season to a .256 average with 16 homers and 44 RBIs. He has 96
strikeouts in 324 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is no secret that we have been trying to acquire another
bat for the middle of our lineup,'' Brewers GM Dean Taylor said.
''Anytime you have the ability to acquire a player coming off a
31-home run, 116-RBI season last year, you certainly have to be
delighted with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sexson, wildly popular with Indians fans, joins a list of young
players like Jeromy Burnitz, Brian Giles and Sean Casey the Indians
have traded in the past few years while trying to win their first
World Series title since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   ''On one hand it's good that we've been able to develop players
that are attractive to other clubs,'' Hart said. ''Richie has
upside and it's going to be a good opportunity for Richie and a
very, very difficult deal for us. He has a chance to be a 30-homer
guy every year. He's going to go on and have a nice career.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 25, made his major league debut last month and is 0-3
with a 14.73 ERA in two starts and three relief appearances,
pitching a total of 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rigdon, 24, was sent to the minors when Davis was brought up on
June 28. Rigdon was 1-1 with a 7.64 ERA in five games for the
Indians, who had brought him up from Triple-A Buffalo on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   They were just two of six pitchers who to make their major
league debuts this season for the Indians, who have already set a
franchise record by using 27 pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This gives our club an opportunity to right itself and to play
meaningful games in August and September which is what we promise
our fans every year,'' Hart said. ''We've had tremendous injuries
but this is still a team we all believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, 28, was hitting .282 with 16 home runs and 51 RBIs in
89 games as the Pirates' starting left fielder. He played last year
in Cleveland, hitting .299 with eight homers and 32 RBIs in a
season shortened by a broken left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Hart said Sexson's departure would not effect Ramirez's
situation. On Wednesday, Ramirez's agent, Jeff Moorad, rejected a
five-year, $75 million contract offer.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians insist that Ramirez is not on the trading block.

<HEADLINE> Fire Contained at Ex-US Army Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KARNACK, Texas (AP) -- A fire in a former ammunition factory on a
Superfund site was extinguished after burning about 14 hours
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Environmental Protection Agency said the
building was several miles from the hazardous site being cleaned.
No contaminates or hazardous fumes were released, EPA spokesman
Dave Bary said.
</P>
<P>
   The sprawling, wooded site was once home to the 8,500-acre
Longhorn Army Ammunition Plant and is being cleaned up under the
EPA's Superfund program.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which engulfed an abandoned metal building about the
size of a football field, apparently started when a liquid oxygen
tank used to fuel a cutting torch exploded Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   No workers were in the building at the time, and investigators
don't know why the tank exploded. The fire was discovered by a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   Although the plant's water system had been turned off, the
firefighters had no problem keeping the fire contained, said Deidre
Evans, Harrison County assistant fire marshal.
</P>
<P>
   The burning building, which contained asbestos, was in a remote
part of the property.
</P>
<P>
   The plant had been used to produce rocket motors, dynamite and
other explosives between 1942 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said the building was being demolished by Shreveport,
La.-based River City Iron and Metal.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Army and Thiokol Corp., a defense contractor that
operated the plant for more than 40 years, have been sued by
neighbors and former workers, claiming chemicals used at the plant
had polluted ground water and soil.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to River City, Thiokol, the Environmental Protection
Agency and the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission were
not immediately returned Friday.

<HEADLINE> Pirates Deal Cordero To Indians  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Outfielder Wil Cordero, who left Cleveland to
sign a $9 million, three-year contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates
last winter, was traded back to the Indians on Friday for infielder
Enrique Wilson and outfielder Alex Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was among three for the busy Indians, who obtained
closer Bob Wickman and starters Steve Woodard and Jason Bere from
the Milwaukee Brewers for a package including slugger Richie
Sexson. They also dealt outfielder Ricky Ledee, recently acquired
from the Yankees, to Texas for first baseman David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero was scratched from the Pirates' lineup minutes before
their rain-delayed game with San Diego began.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cam Bonifay called late in the afternoon and asked if Wil
would be willing to waive his right to demand a trade in the event
he was traded to Cleveland,'' said Cordero's agent, Jeff Moorad.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans traded during multiyear contracts have an automatic
right to demand another trade following the next World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ''After consulting with Cam, I told Cam that Wil was comfortable
returning to the Indians and would not exercise his right to demand
a trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, 28, was hitting .282 with 16 home runs and 51 RBIs in
89 games as the Pirates' starting left fielder. He played last year
in Cleveland, hitting .299 with eight homers and 32 RBIs in a
season shortened by a broken left wrist.
</P>
<P>
   He did not re-sign with the Indians after they offered him only
a one-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The trade pares the Pirates' payroll and also makes them an even
younger team, and gives the Indians another contact hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, 25, started a injury reassignment Friday with Triple-A
Buffalo. In 40 games with Cleveland, Wilson batted .325 with two
homers and 12 RBIs. He played third base, second base and shortstop
after being acquired from Minnesota for left-hander Shawn Bryant in
February 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, also 25, is likely to be a spare outfielder with the
Pirates, just as he was in Cleveland. He began Friday night's game
batting .286 with five homers and 12 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates signed Cordero to improve what they felt was an
underperforming offense, with general manager Cam Bonifay saying,
''He was the hitter our scouts said we had to have.''
</P>
<P>
   Cordero was not a disappointment in Pittsburgh, but had little
impact on a team that started 6-12 and quickly fell out of the NL
Central race. He also angered some teammates by taking nearly a
week off with a case of the stomach flu at a time when the Pirates
were slumping and needed his bat.
</P>
<P>
   With the Pirates moving into new PNC Park off what is likely to
be an eighth consecutive losing season, the pressure to improve is
greatly increasing in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Bonifay already has promised a roster shakeup, saying, ''This
isn't the club that will be playing in PNC Park.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is the second between the Indians and Pirates in less
than two years. The first was considered the best during Bonifay's
seven seasons as general manager, All-Star outfielder Brian Giles
for left-handed reliever Ricardo Rincon.
</P>
<P>
   Sexson mostly played left field for the Indians, but hasn't
started as much since they acquired Ricky Ledee. The Indians were
seeking another contact hitter, with Cordero likely to be used
mostly as a left fielder and designated hitter.

<HEADLINE> 10 Commandments Gets Injunction  </HEADLINE>
By REX W. HUPPKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- A federal judge on Friday issued a temporary
injunction barring the state from erecting a Ten Commandments
monument on the Statehouse lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The Indiana Civil Liberties Union sued to block the monument,
saying it violates the Constitution by representing the
establishment of religion by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The state has not decided whether to appeal, said Cheryl Reed, a
spokeswoman for Gov. Frank O'Bannon.
</P>
<P>
   A new Indiana law that went into effect July 1 allows schools
and other government units to post the Ten Commandments if they are
displayed with other historical documents.
</P>
<P>
   The Statehouse monument would include inscriptions of the Bill
of Rights and the preamble to the Indiana Constitution in addition
to the Ten Commandments.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that because this monument was to be displayed in a
historical context it would be constitutional,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana Civil Liberties Union lawyer Ken Falk noted that the
injunction is temporary and said the case still must be litigated
on its merits. A trial date has not been set.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judge indicated that ... the monument lacks a secular
purpose and it has the effect of endorsing a religious belief,''
Falk said. ''Either one of those two is enough to render the law
unconstitutional.''
</P>
<P>
   A Ten Commandments monument was erected at the Statehouse in
1958, but it was removed in 1991 after being vandalized several
times.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 16, Padres 5  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Aramis Ramirez hit a grand slam and a two-run
homer and the Pittsburgh Pirates, without the traded Wil Cordero,
had their best offensive game of the season in beating San Diego
16-5 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez, who had three homers and 17 RBIs entering the game, hit
his first career grand slam in a five-run first inning against Matt
Clement (9-10). The Pirates had a pair of five-run innings while
hitting four multiple-run homers.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez added a two-run shot in the sixth off Carlos Almanzar
while going 3-for-4 in his best game in the majors. He was the
Pirates' starting third baseman for part of the 1998 season as a
19-year-old, then began this season as a starter before again
returning to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez had homered twice since returning to the Pirates on June
19.
</P>
<P>
   Cordero, signed to a $9 million, three-year contract last
winter, was traded back to Cleveland for outfielder Alex Ramirez
and infielder Enrique Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   John Vander Wal, also rumored to be on the trading block with
the Monday deadline approaching, added a three-run homer, his 14th,
in the second as Clement lasted 3 1-3 innings in his shortest start
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Clement, the Padres' most consistent starter in an
injury-decimated season and a Pittsburgh-area native, left during a
five-run third inning after allowing 10 runs -- nine earned -- and
six hits. His ERA jumped from 5.13 to 5.62.
</P>
<P>
   Clement was replaced by Matt Whiteside, who gave up Emil Brown's
three-run homer in the Pirates' second five-run inning. Brown, a
reserve outfielder who has shuttled back and forth from the minors
this season, hadn't homered since June 2, 1997, when he spent the
season with the Pirates as Rule 5 player.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie right-hander Bronson Arroyo (2-3) wasn't as sharp as he
was in limiting Philadelphia to two infield singles in seven
innings Saturday, but still lasted six innings for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Arroyo shook off a two-run Padres first to pitch four shutout
innings, and might have escaped a three-run sixth with only a run
scoring. But third baseman Ramirez threw away an apparent
inning-ending grounder ahead of Dave Magadan's two-run pinch
double.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Young and Ramirez were hit in succession by Todd Erdos
pitches in the eighth inning, but there were no incidents. Brown
followed with a sacrifice fly, giving him four RBIs.
Notes: After the start was delayed 1 hour, 17 minutes by rain, the
first inning took 29 minutes as Clement and Arroyo combined for 61
pitches. ... Padres 1B Ryan Klesko was a late scratch with
tightness in his left hamstring. ... Padres C Carlos Hernandez,
activated off the disabled list before the game, also had an RBI
double in the sixth. ... The Pirates had lost three of four. ...
Pirates starting pitchers are 5-1 in the last eight games. ...
Pittsburgh is 6-10 against the NL West. The Padres are 15-16
against the NL Central. ... 3B Phil Nevin's error in the fourth was
only the sixth in the Padres' last 18 games.

<HEADLINE> Eagles Sign First Round Pick Simon  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- First-round pick Corey Simon agreed to terms
with the Philadelphia Eagles on a five-year deal Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, the No. 6 pick overall in April's draft, will join the
team before its flight to Cleveland on Saturday. Philadelphia opens
its preseason against the Browns on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The deal comes two days after team owner Jeffrey Lurie
criticized the negotiating stance of Simon's agents, Roosevelt
Barnes and Eugene Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so easy to calculate,'' Lurie said about slotting draft
picks into certain salaries. ''This is basic, sixth-grade
mathematics. We always bend over backwards to be fair, aggressive.
And anything else is just, uh, bullbleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   In accordance with previous No. 6 picks, Simon's contract is
likely to have included a signing bonus of about $6 million and
about $2.2 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, a 6-foot-1, 293-pound defensive tackle from Florida
State, is expected to make an immediate impact on the Eagles'
defensive line.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're looking forward to getting Corey on the field for
Tuesday's practice and even though he has some work to do, we're
very confident that he'll be an integral part of our defense for
many years to come,'' Eagles coach Andy Reid said, adding that
Simon likely won't play against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's agents were pushing for a four-year deal. Lurie insisted
the team ''would never sign a short deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Banner, the Eagles' chief operating officer, had said that a
variety of issues were holding up the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not one formula or one item where it's really a matter of
dollars or years,'' Banner said. ''It's a series of items that
we're working on.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon's agents could not be reached for comment. They have
refused to speak to reporters about the matter for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Both agents have a history of holding their clients out of
training camp. They have represented several top defensive linemen
who have missed most or all of their rookie training camps,
including Arizona's Andre Wadsworth and Baltimore's Peter
Bouleware, who both played with Simon in college.
</P>
<P>
   The agents also represented Arizona's Simeon Rice, who set the
NFL rookie record with 11 sacks after holding out.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second consecutive year the Eagles' first-round
pick was a holdout. Donovan McNabb, last year's first-round pick,
held out the first week of training camp, and it affected his early
progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're pleased to have settled on a contract with still a good
deal of time remaining in training camp,'' Banner said.
</P>
<P>
   Reid has maintained all along that Simon must report quickly
even though his position does not require as much repetitions as
quarterbacks.

Philadelphia has high expectations entering Reid's second year.

<HEADLINE> Flight Makes Emergency Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- A Pan American Airways flight with 69
people on board made an emergency landing and more than dozen
passengers were taken to hospitals after the plane was tossed by
heavy turbulence Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Pan American president Dave Fink said there didn't appear to be
any serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of the 14 passengers who were taken to hospitals had
been released Friday night, the (Charleston) Post and Courier
reported. A fight attendant who had been knocked unconscious during
the turbulence remained hospitalized, no details were available on
the other person.
</P>
<P>
   Fink said the Boeing 727 was flying from Sanford, Fla., to
Pittsburgh when it hit turbulence and dropped at least 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''People were really buffeted around, so the best thing to do
was go to the nearest airport and set it down,'' Fink said.
</P>
<P>
   He said there were no problems with the plane, which landed in
Charleston about 6 p.m., but another plane was sent to pick up the
passengers and continue the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Pan American began flying in 1927 but ceased operations in 1991.
A new service began operating late last year out of Newington, N.H.

<HEADLINE> Water Temperature Rise Hurts Coral  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Since 1984, tropical waters in the Northern
Hemisphere have been heating at a higher rate than other waters
around the world, threatening coral reefs, scientists said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A team of scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Association analyzed surface temperature data from satellites and
found that the tropical waters above the equator are heating at a
rate of 1 degree Fahrenheit per decade, 10 times the global rate.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists think this may be why they have seen an
unprecedented amount of coral bleaching, damage to the coral, over
the past decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most troubling finding is the marked increase in the
tropical waters of the Northern Hemisphere,'' said Alan E. Strong,
who led the team. ''If this trend were to continue, implicates for
our coral reefs throughout these waters would be bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   Many invertebrates and other organisms essential to ocean
ecosystems make their home in coral reefs, and coral bleaching can
have far-reaching effects on ocean life.

<HEADLINE> Baseball Trades Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   All-Stars Mike Bordick and Bob Wickman, along with Wil Cordero,
Richie Sexson and David Segui, switched teams Friday as contenders
revamped their rosters with baseball's trade deadline approaching.
</P>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians were the busiest of all, swinging three
deals. The New York Mets and Tampa Bay each made two.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have 2000 in mind and that's what we're going to work for
in the next 72 hours,'' Indians general manager John Hart said
in-between trades. ''We're calling teams and they're calling us.''
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for making trades without waivers is 4 p.m. EDT
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There was talk that Texas closer John Wetteland, Montreal
outfielder Rondell White and Milwaukee outfielder Jeromy Burnitz
soon might change teams, too.
</P>
<P>
   ''See if we can't make four or five more before the deadline,''
Indians manager Charlie Manuel said.
</P>
<P>
   After a month that saw Curt Schilling, Denny Neagle, Andy Ashby
and David Justice switch clubs, there was a frenzy Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, desperate for healthy arms, got Wickman for their
bullpen and Steve Woodard and Jason Bere for their rotation from
Milwaukee. In return, the Brewers received slugger Richie Sexson,
rookie pitchers Paul Rigdon and Kane Davis and a player to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland later got Cordero, who left the Indians after last
season and signed a $9 million, three-year contract with
Pittsburgh, from the Pirates for outfielder Alex Ramirez and
infielder Enrique Wilson. Cordero was hitting .282 with 16 home
runs and 51 RBIs in 89 games.
</P>
<P>
   Still busy, Cleveland then sent outfielder Ricky Ledee to Texas
for Segui, who could play first base, outfield and DH. Ledee joined
the Indians last month in the deal that sent Justice to the New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're not established in the big leagues, it's going to
happen,'' Ledee said.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to convince Barry Larkin to join them last weekend, the
Mets filled their shortstop hole by obtaining Bordick from
Baltimore for infielder-outfielder Melvin Mora and three minor
leaguers -- pitchers Lesli Brea and Pat Gorman and
catcher-outfielder Mike Kinkade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very excited with the opportunity to be in a playoff
race,'' Bordick said. ''The Orioles are struggling this year and to
be thrust into a playoff race is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours later, the Mets acquired Rick White and outfielder Bubba
Trammell from Tampa Bay for outfielder Jason Tyner and pitcher Paul
Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the time for us to make our move,'' Mets general
manager Steve Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   The Athletics bolstered their bullpen Friday, getting Mecir and
a minor leaguer from Tampa Bay for two minor leaguers. Mecir has
been one of the most effective middle relievers in the AL this
season, going 7-2 with one save and a 3.08 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland also acquired Triple-A pitcher Todd Belitz for pitcher
Jesus Colome -- one of the A's top prospects -- and a player to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   In another trade, the Chicago Cubs and Anaheim swapped five
minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White and Burnitz, meanwhile, were both attracting
interest from the New York Yankees. Wetteland was mentioned in
talks involving the Mets, St. Louis and Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   There was a chance, too, Atlanta might sign recently released
reliever Stan Belinda.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets talked about Bordick earlier, but were ready to give up
on any deal until the Orioles called Thursday night. Bordick,
eligible for free agency after the season, will join his new team
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're ecstatic to acquire a player of Bordick's ability,''
Phillips said. ''We look to him to add tremendous stability to the
left side of our infield. His offensive production will be a boost
as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Bordick, who turned 35 last week, is hitting .297 with a
career-high 16 home runs and 59 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips had been trying to upgrade at shortstop -- Mora was not
the answer -- since Gold Glover Rey Ordonez broke his left arm May
29. The Mets had a deal in place for Larkin, but the Cincinnati
star blocked it.
</P>
<P>
   In White, the Mets got help for their overworked bullpen. He was
3-6 with a 3.41 ERA in 44 games.
</P>
<P>
   ''White was near the top of our list,'' Phillips said. ''We had
a number of alternatives. As we weighed them, the level of players
and the price of others was pretty significant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians, who began the day 10&AMP;frac12; games behind Chicago in the
AL Central, were desperate for pitching help.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard and Bere will immediately move into the rotation to
replace Charles Nagy and Jaret Wright, both on the disabled list
and may be out until September.
</P>
<P>
   Wickman, signed through 2001, has 16 saves. He is 2-2 with a
2.93 ERA in 43 games. A Wisconsin native, he sounded disappointed
by the deal -- Saturday was Bob Wickman Poster Night at County
Stadium when Milwaukee plays Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trade hurts, that's all I can say,'' Wickman said.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim sent pitcher Brett Hinchcliffe and infielder Keith
Luuloa to the Cubs for outfielder Chris Hatcher, pitcher Mike
Heathcott and infielder Brett King.

<HEADLINE> Indians Trade Ledee to Texas  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Ricky Ledee's stay in Cleveland didn't
last long, as the Indians dealt him to the Texas Rangers on Friday
for first baseman David Segui.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one month after the Indians got Ledee from the New
York Yankees in a trade for David Justice, Cleveland traded the
promising outfielder.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you're not established in the big leagues, it's going to
happen,'' Ledee said.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, 26, once one of the top prospects in the Yankees' system,
hasn't displayed that promise in the majors. He is hitting .236
with nine homers and 39 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ''For us to make this trade, we wanted to pick up a good young
player as opposed to a younger prospect who was a few years away,''
Rangers general manager Doug Melvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers signed Segui to a $4,325,000, one-year contract in
the offseason. He hit .336 with 11 homers and 57 RBIs for Texas and
is one of the best fielding first basemen in the league.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas wasn't planning on re-signing Segui, in part because
of the development of minor leaguer Carlos Pena, who homered in the
All-Star Futures game earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had an opportunity to get a young player who will be with
us next year,'' Melvin said. ''This came out of the blue. ... We
decided that's the best deal we could make.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the only deal of the day for the Indians. First,
they obtained closer Bob Wickman and starters Steve Woodard and
Jason Bere from the Milwaukee Brewers for slugger Richie Sexson,
rookie right-handers Paul Rigdon and Kane Davis and a player to be
named.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Indians brought back outfielder Wil Cordero, who became
a free agent after last season, acquiring him from Pittsburgh for
outfielder Alex Ramirez and infielder Enrique Wilson.

<HEADLINE> Lynx 68, Sol 44  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Katie Smith scored 25 points Friday night as
the Minnesota Lynx beat the Miami Sol 68-44.
</P>
<P>
   Smith shot 10-for-13 from the field, including 4-for-4 on
3-pointers range. She has now made a league-leading 75 3-pointers --
one short of the league record with seven games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota (12-13) won its second straight game after breaking a
franchise record eight-game losing streak on July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Miami (9-17) lost its third straight and sixth consecutive on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   The Lynx failed to score during the first 5:22 of the opening
half but trailed just 3-0. After Betty Lennox made two free throws
to cut the lead to 3-2, the Lynx went on a 21-5 run in the next
8:33 and led 30-20 at the half.
</P>
<P>
   No Miami player scored more than eight points.

   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Furious with the inauguration of Alberto Fujimori as
Peru's president Peruvians set government buildings ablaze Friday and chanted
''the dictatorship will fall!'' Tear gas and smoke turned the skies over the

injured. Tens of thousands of demonstrators filled the streets. Inside the
heavily guarded Congress building, a beaming Fujimori celebrated the beginning

Napster Wins Stay in Appeals Court

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Two federal appeals judges Friday granted Napster Inc.
a stay allowing the wildly popular music trading service to remain online -- at
least temporarily. The service was facing a midnight PDT deadline for shutting
down after a lower court judge sided with the recording industry, which claimed
Napster allows users to violate copyrights. The Recording Industry Association
of America could still appeal Friday's decision -- either to the full 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals or the U.S. Supreme Court. Friday's ruling means
Napster can remain in operation at least until the lawsuit goes to trial; no
trial date has been set.

5 Early Concorde Incidents Cited
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Blown tires on the European-built Concorde supersonic
planes caused five ''potentially catastrophic'' incidents in the first two years
of the luxury airliner's commercial life, including one that damaged an engine,
punctured fuel tanks and left a large hole in the top of the wing. That mishap,
on June 14, 1979, sounded eerily similar to what authorities believe may have
happened just before Tuesday's crash outside Paris killing 114 people. The 1979
incident, and four less dangerous events involving Air France and British
Airways Concordes over the next two years, resulted in adoption of strict
inspection and emergency procedures. No similar failures had occurred in two
decades of operation before Tuesday's crash outside Paris.

Cohen Proposes Military Food Subsidy

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to turn around an embarrassing problem, the
Pentagon Friday proposed giving grocery store debit cards to low-income troops,
so they would no longer have to use food stamps. Secretary of Defense William
Cohen said the plan to subsidize military members' food purchases with an
in-house Department of Defense program would cost the Pentagon $31 million a
year. It also would help to some people who didn't qualify under the traditional
Agriculture Department food stamp program. It was not immediately clear how many
would get the assistance.

UN Makes Indigenous Rights Forum

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. member states have decided to create a permanent
U.N. forum on indigenous rights that will give native peoples their first
high-level representation in the United Nations. U.N. officials called Friday's
decision historic, noting that indigenous people have been seeking
representation on the international level since they approached the League of
Nations in the early part of the 20th century. The forum ''promises to give
indigenous peoples a unique voice within the United Nations system, commensurate
with the unique problems which many indigenous people still face, but also with
the unique contribution they make to the human rights dialogue,'' U.N. High
Commissioner for Human Rights Mary Robinson said.

   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The Hearst Corp. completed its $660 million purchase of
the rival San Francisco Chronicle on Friday and kept its promise to sell its
venerable San Francisco Examiner to a local publisher of free newspapers. Hearst
announced the changes in ownership a day after U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn
Walker ruled out antitrust questions in Hearst's purchase of the Chronicle. The
judge also said that nothing in the law requires Hearst to give the Examiner --
or its promised subsidy of $66 million over three years -- to publisher Ted
Fang, who is closely allied with Mayor Willie Brown and other Democratic
