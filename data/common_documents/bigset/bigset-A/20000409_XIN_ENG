<HEADLINE> Turkey's Population to Rise to 70 Million by 2005 </HEADLINE>

<P>
ANKARA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's population is expected to

promote closer ties with South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on South African Broadcasting Corporation, Wahid said

Wahid is to leave South Africa for Cuba on Monday, and will
also visit Mexico, Hong Kong and Japan before returning to

<HEADLINE> WWF Warns Against Commercial Whaling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Foundation
(WWF) warned here on Sunday that whaling could spiral out of
control if the Parties to the Convention (POC) on the
International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) approve
proposals by Japan and Norway to reopen the international trade in
whale meat.
</P>
<P>
WWF said in a statement released after the opening ceremony of
the 11th Conference of POC Sunday that the proposed "downlistings"
of minke and gray whales from Appendix I (which bans international
trade) to Appendix II (which allows controlled trade) would be
playing into the hands of those who wanted to increase whale
catches.
</P>
<P>
All commercial whaling has been banned by the International
Whaling Commission since 1986. Proposals to reopen the ban on
whaling were rejected at the 10th conference of the Parties to
the CITES in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Any discussion about rules for controlling whaling must take
place in the International Whaling Commission (IWC). That is the
only way to ensure that the disastrous overhunting of whales that
occurred throughout the 20th century can never be repeated," said
Cassandra Phillips, coordinator of the WWF for Whales and the
Antarctic.
</P>
<P>
"It is the IWC's job to decide on the rules for the hunting of
whales," Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
"CITES is the only concerned with international trade, and you
can't have trade before you have hunting. That is one of the
reasons why it is simply not appropriate for CITES to consider
opening up trade in whales before the IWC has put in place a
management scheme," the coordinator said.
</P>
<P>
Norway and Japan are the only two countries that continue to
sidestep the International Whaling Commission's ban on whaling.
In 1999, a total of 1078 whales were taken by the two countries,
according to the WWF.

<HEADLINE> Iran Catches Panamanian Tanker Carrying Iraqi Oil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Sunday that it has
stopped a Panamanian oil tanker suspected of carrying smuggled
Iraqi oil in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The official IRNA news agency quoted the elite Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) as saying the seizure was made
after the tanker, "Ramim al-Khaleej," violated Iranian territorial
waters.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said the tanker gave no heed to the warnings and the IRGC
patrol fired blank shots and forced it to stop. The tanker asked to
be allowed to return to Iraq where it had loaded the oil, which was
apparently refused, and it is now under control of the IRGC navy.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time in a week that Iran said it had
intercepted a ship loaded with Iraqi oil. On Wednesday IRNA said
the IRGC stopped on April 1 a Honduras-registered vehicle with 2,
500 tons of Iraqi oil in the Gulf but did not say why it took four
days for the IRGC to announce the seizure.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle, al-Masroo, is still in the waters off the southern
coast of Iran with its 18 crew members under the command of Captain
Qassem Abdul Qader.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, under a sweeping economic embargo since it invaded Kuwait
in 1990, has been allowed to sell a limited amount of oil to buy
food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies. There were reports
of oil smuggling but Iran had mainly kept silent over the matter.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two neighbors worsened recently as they
accused each other of supporting rebel groups carrying out terror
attacks in their capitals.

<HEADLINE> Canada Ready to Send Peacekeepers to South Lebanon: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada is ready to send a
peacekeeping force to south Lebanon after Israel's troop
withdrawal, visiting Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said
here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Chretien told reporters after meeting with his Israeli
counterpart Ehud Barak that if the U.N. Security Council decides to
send an international peacekeeping force to south Lebanon to
maintain peace there after Israeli troop withdrawal, Canada will
participate if asked for.
</P>
<P>
Canada maintains special ties with Israel and will continue to
support the Middle East peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
Barak said that his government will continue to try to push the
peace process forward despite it is faced with too many
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
On his upcoming Washington meeting with U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Tuesday, Barak said the two sides will touch upon all
issues concerning both the Palestinian and the Syrian track, but he
is not certain whether there will be a breakthrough in the
resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations broke down again in
January after the two rounds of talks in the United States since
their resumption last December, due to Barak's refusal to promise
to return to Syria all the Golan Heights, which Israel captured in
the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Clinton failed to persuade Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad to revive talks with the Israelis at their summit in
Geneva, the first in several years.
</P>
<P>
Washington said Saturday that it has received "oral responses"
from Assad to Barak's proposal for breaking the impasse in the
peace talks, this led Clinton to call an urgent meeting with Barak
at the White House.
</P>
<P>
During the Sunday meeting, Barak and Chretien also discussed
bilateral issues and ways to promote cooperation in the fields of
trade and high-tech.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Canada signed a free-trade agreement in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Canada has a long history of involvement in Middle East
peacekeeping missions. It played a central role in defusing the
Suez Canal Crisis in 1956 and introduced the modern-day concept of
U.N. peacekeeping. A Canadian now commends the U.N. Disengagement
Observer Force in the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Chretien arrived here Saturday night for a four-day visit. He
will travel to Gaza Strip on Monday to hold talks there with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
His ongoing Middle East trip will last 12 days, which will also
take him to Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Safeguarding Press Freedom in Iran Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of Iran's Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) on Sunday called on the government to
safeguard the press freedom in the country to push forward the
reform process.
</P>
<P>
"We should pay the price to foster openness in the society by
granting freedom to the journalists," IRNA managing director,
Fereydoun Verdinejad, said on the sidelines of the press court to
which he was summoned for the second time for being informed of
complaints against IRNA.
</P>
<P>
IRNA and its newspapers, widely believed to be close to the
Iranian moderate President Mohammad Khatami, have been under strong
attacks of the conservatives since President Khatami came to power
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The conservative critics accused IRNA and its newspapers for
siding the reformists in their publications.
</P>
<P>
Verdinejad said that the security forces, the headquarters for
enjoining good and prohibition of evil, Friday prayer leader of
Bojnord, Basij (volunteer forces), a parliament member and managing
director of the newly banned weekly Panjshanbeha (Thursdays), Jaleh
Oskuee, have filed complaint against the news agency.
</P>
<P>
He expressed pleasure that political rivalry in the society has
been transformed into judicial proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Verdinejad's summon came in a new wave of conservative pressures
on the pro-freedom press. Within the two weeks after the Iranian
new year starting on March 20, several prominent reformist
journalists have been summoned to the press court, Intelligence
Ministry and other authorities.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, Mohammad Reza Khatami, brother of the President
Khatami and managing director of the reformist daily Mosharekat
(participation) was summoned to the press court, the first one in
the new year.
</P>
<P>
Khatami was the top winner in the Iranian capital in the key
parliamentary elections on February 18, in which reformists won an
overwhelming victory over the conservatives, who dominate the
country's most sensitive organs.
</P>
<P>
Iran's growing press with strong political backgrounds went
through severe ups and downs and the licenses of 78 publications
were revoked in Tehran alone during the past Iranian year ended
March 19.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz (This
Morning) Saeed Hajjarian, a close ally of President Khatami, was
seriously wounded by gunmen in a shooting on March 12, days before
the end of the past Iranian year.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Claims Responsibility for Rocket Attack on Northern Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Hezbollah guerrillas on Sunday
claimed responsibility for a Katyusha rocket attack on northern
Israel following an earlier Israeli shelling which injured four
Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army has confirmed the rocket attack, but there were no
immediate reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said in a statement that it had fired on "Israeli
positions on the border," including crossing points into northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The rockets, numbered a dozen by security sources in south
Lebanon, fell on the village of Margaliot near the Lebanese border
and not far from Israeli army positions located in the Israeli-
occupied security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
And one of them smashed into a poultry farm in the village, the
army added.
</P>
<P>
The rocket explosion caused severe damage to the property of the
farm but no people was hurt, the army added, saying that the
Israeli side is investigating the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Katyusha rockets attack came after an exchange of fire
earlier in the day in the eastern and central sectors of the
security zone that left four Lebanese and two officers of Israel's
allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) wounded.
</P>
<P>
Three Lebanese civilians and one Lebanese soldier were injured
by shelling from the security zone that fell on the main square in
the Arab Salim village.
</P>
<P>
Several houses, shops and cars were also damaged as Israeli
artillery pounded the village, believed to be a stronghold of
Hezbollah guerrillas who have been fighting against the Israeli
occupation of south Lebanon since 1985 when Israel set up this
security zone with a self-proclaimed purpose of protecting its
northern security.
</P>
<P>
The two wounded SLA officers have been moved to Israel for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak blasted the Katyusha attack, saying it
could not stop Israel from pulling out its troops from south
Lebanon by July this year.

<HEADLINE> 2 Women Wounded in Bomb Explosion in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Two women were wounded in Iraq on
Sunday when a bomb believed to be left over in the wake of the 1991
Gulf War exploded, the Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded near the Al-Falluja city, 60 kilometers west
of the capital Baghdad, when the two, identified as Saada Abbas
Shalan and Jawahir Faris Shalan, who are cousins, herded sheep.
</P>
<P>
However, the INA did not mention what touched off the bomb.
</P>
<P>
A total of 56,483 bombs and one cruise missile left over by the
Gulf War have been defused, said the INA.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf War, which was triggered by Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, the U.S.-led multi-national forces defeated Iraq
and drove the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
After the war, the U.S. and its Western allies imposed two so-
called no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq, claiming to
protect the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south
from the persecution of the Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes, patrolling the no-fly zones, often
bombed Iraqi civilian targets in the zones, causing heavy civilian
casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the Gulf War and the constant bombardments
in the no-fly zones have left a large amount of unexploded bombs in
Iraq, imperilling the lives of the Iraqi people.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Protest Nullifying of Election Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A large number of people from two
towns near Iran's capital Tehran held a rally on Sunday to protest
the nullification of the result of the sixth parliamentary
elections in the towns by the Guardians Council (GC).
</P>
<P>
The protesters said that the elections held in February were
free and fair, and the GC should revoke its decision to cancel the
polling result in their towns, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The two small towns of Damavand and Firuzkuh, northeast of
Tehran, share one-seat in the new parliament, which has a total of
290 seats.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of protesters also signed a petition addressed to
Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari, which urged the ministry
to dispatch a team to investigate the matter, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the local Iran News daily reported on Sunday that
police had arrested dozens of people amid days of unrest in Iranian
cities where election results were canceled by the GC.
</P>
<P>
Some 40 people had been jailed in the northwestern city of
Khalkhal after angry residents went on the rampage late Thursday,
ransacking government offices and setting vehicles on fire.
</P>
<P>
The protest erupted after the GC overturned results from city
voting booths, taking away the victory of a reformist candidate and
handing it to his conservative rival.
</P>
<P>
The GC has called on local officials to abide by the law and
avoid measures that could agitate public opinion. In a statement
released on Saturday, it termed the recent events in Khalkhal as "
bitter incidents" which demanded some clarification.
</P>
<P>
Reformers supporting President Mohammad Khatami won more than 75
percent of the seats in the new parliament in a landslide victory
which humiliated the powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
The election results have caused political tension in Iran. And
recent events, including the abortive assassination attempt against
prominent reformer, Saeed Hajjarian, and the summoning of famous
reformist journalists by the press court, make people worry about
the country's political future.
</P>
<P>
The conservative GC, as the watchdog of the elections, has not
yet approved the soundness of the first-round election results in
29 constituencies involving 60 candidates.
</P>
<P>
Those constituencies include the capital Tehran, where reformers
seized at least 29 of the 30 seats.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the GC has rescinded the wins of seven reformers in
the elections, stirring up a series of protests. It had also barred
many reformers from standing in the polls before the event took
place.
</P>
<P>
Run-off elections are due to be held later this month in 52
constituencies for 65 candidates who did not get the minimum 25
percent of votes needed to enter the parliament in the first round.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Satisfied With Statement of GCC FMs' Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait on Sunday hailed the
final statement of foreign ministers meeting of the Gulf
Cooperation Council(GCC), which urged Iraq to implement U.N.
resolutions related to its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait expressed its satisfaction at its weekly cabinet meeting,
in which Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah briefed
the cabinet on the outcome of the GCC ministerial meeting that was
held Saturday in the western Saudi city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
Repeating the terms of the statement, the cabinet called on Iraq
to implement U.N. Security Council Resolution 1284 and cooperate
with the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission
(UNMOVIC), halt provocative actions towards its neighbors and
contribute on enhancing security and stability of the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
It also urged Baghdad to release more than 600 Kuwaiti and non-
Kuwaiti prisoners alleged still held in Iraqi jails, the Kuwait
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti cabinet also regretted over Iraq's "continuing
refusal to all Arab and international calls and initiatives on
realizing an active means to lift economic sanctions against the
Iraqi people."
</P>
<P>
Before the cabinet session, Sabah also voiced satisfaction with
the "solid and coherent" stand adopted by the GCC foreign ministers
toward issues concerning the Gulf region, especially the Iraqi
problem.
</P>
<P>
Besides calling for Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions, the
foreign ministers also hoped Iran can cooperate with a specified
GCC committee to peacefully solve its territorial dispute with the
United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran claim the islands of Abu Mussa and Greater
and Lesser Tunbs, in the mouth of the strategic Strait of Hormuz.
The isles are now controlled by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance formed in
1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
UAE.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz met on Sunday with visiting
U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen on bilateral ties and
regional security issues.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which took place in the Red Sea port city of
Jeddah, covered political and security issues of mutual concern,
especially the current situation in the area including the Iraq
matter and the Middle East peace process, U.S. diplomatic sources
told Kuwait News Agency.
</P>
<P>
But the sources did not go into details about the Saudi-U.S.
discussion.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who arrived in Saudi Arabia earlier Sunday from Kuwait,
began his present Gulf tour in Qatar last Wednesday. He had also
visited Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
In remarks to the press in Kuwait on Saturday, the U.S. defense
chief said his talks with the Gulf leaders are centering on a "
cooperative defense initiative" designed to deter possible chemical
and biological attacks on any Gulf Arab state and the U.S. forces
stationed in the region.
</P>
<P>
He hopes the Gulf states would participate in the defense plan,
which he said includes the building of an early warning system.
</P>
<P>
Washington has in the past two years been trying to get the
approval of the governments of the six Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) member states to share the system with the U.S. forces. But
there has been little indication that showed the Gulf states have
agreed to join in the plan.
</P>
<P>
The GCC comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arab and
the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> 22 Killed in Road Accidents in Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A total of 22 people have been
killed and 196 others injured in traffic accidents across Greece
since Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite strict measures by traffic police, 149 traffic
accidents have occurred between Friday afternoon and Sunday as
thousands of citizens abandoned the capital city of Athens and
flocked to their hometowns to vote in Sunday's parliamentary
elections, the 10th since the restoration of democracy in Greece
in 1974.
</P>
<P>
Many Greek voters who live in the city are still on the
electoral rolls in hometowns throughout the country, and more than
8.9 million registered voters were called on to cast their ballots
for a new government at the 18.959 polling stations in the country.
</P>
<P>
Although the number of traffic deaths is on a steady decrease
in Greece in recent years, the country's traffic accident rate is
among the highest in the 15-member European Union (EU) countries,
with more than 2,000 people killed and 30,000 others injured
annually in accidents.

<HEADLINE> German CDU Holds Party Congress Under Kohl Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ESSEN, Germany, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Aiming to drag the party
out of crises caused by ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl's slush fund
scandal, Germany's opposition Christian Democrats (CDU) Sunday
began their two-day national congress here.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 delegates coming from 16 states are due to elect
present Secretary General Angela Merkel their new chief at this
meeting. Acting party leader Wolfgang Schaeuble was forced to step
down amid his illicit funding scandals.
</P>
<P>
Merkel, the outspoken former physical teacher born in eastern
Germany, will give the western-rooted party a "new beginning," the
CDU manage circle said. But political and financial crises will
challenge her leadership.
</P>
<P>
The scandal around Kohl is still haunting the party. German
newspapers, radios and television reported new details of the CDU'
s funding practice in his era and former Eastern German secret
police's documents about Kohl.
</P>
<P>
On the other side, the CDU is near bankruptcy with huge debts
of up to 100 million marks. Major part of the debts comes from the
German government's fines against Kohl's illicit funds and the
illegal foreign bank accounts.
</P>
<P>
Days before the election in Germany's most populous North
Rhine-Westphalia state, a poll by the N-TV television showed 35
percent voters supported the CDU, while the supporting rate of the
ruling Social Democrats (SPD) was 39 percent. But before Kohl's
scandal was disclosed, the ratio was 40 to 35.
</P>
<P>
But another poll published in the "Bild am Sonntag" newspaper
showed that Merkel was a most popular politician, even listing
ahead of Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. She will become a "real
threat to Schroeder" in the general election two years later if
she succeeds in reforming the CDU structure, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Merkel urged the party to unite and "turn the
crisis into chance" while the party presidium drafted a structural
reform plan and a financial reform plan. And an "Essen Declaration
" is expected to be passed by the congress.

<P>
MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Exit polls suggest incumbent Eduard
Shevardnadze won over 60 percent of the votes in Sunday's
presidential election in Georgia, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>

Shevardnadze, who took office in November 1995, promised voters
to fight corruption, join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and phase out Russian military bases on its territory. He also
seeks help from the International Monetary Fund to alleviate the
country's poverty.
</P>
<P>
About 70 percent of the country's registered voters cast their
votes, Interfax said, citing unconfirmed reports.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Snowstorm Causes Hundreds of Traffic Accidents in Ottawa, Toronto </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Canada's eastern Ontario has been
hit by a worst snowstorm in recent years, with hundreds of traffic
accidents reported in Ottawa and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Traditional April showers gave way to more than 9 cm of snow in
Ottawa Saturday, when the capital city area recorded nearly 250
traffic accidents and 400 emergency calls, said local media
reports Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Up to 20 people were reported injured in those accidents, which
have not yet caused any deaths.
</P>
<P>
But in the country's biggest city Toronto, fatal accidents have
taken the lives of five men and injured several others.
</P>
<P>
Three young men were killed and two are in hospital after their
car spun out of control and slammed sideways into a concrete pole
in Brampton of the city Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, city police reported two traffic deaths in
Uxbridge. A 63-year-old man lost control of his Chevy Lumina on
snow-covered Brock Rd., killing himself and a 64-year-old
passenger. Another passenger was taken to hospital and is listed
in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
The regional weather center of Ottawa said the city has been
snowed upon 19 times during the month of April since 1939. "It's
normal for it to snow in April, but not this much," said center
spokesman Alain Boisvert Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Toronto saw 3 cm of snow and 16 mm of rain Saturday. The city
recorded its last big spring dump on April 8, 1979, when 19 cm of
snow blanketed Toronto.
</P>
<P>
Local media reports quoted weather forecasters as warning
another storm is approaching eastern Ontario, saying "we always
expect a storm between March 15 and April 15."

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: South Summit of Group of 77  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77 (G-77) will convene
the South Summit in Havana, capital of Cuba, on April 10-14 in
what is the largest G-77 gathering of heads of state or government
from 133 developing countries since its founding in 1964.
</P>
<P>
The Summit will be convened in accordance with the decision
adopted by the 21st Ministerial Meeting of G-77 held in September
1977 at the United Nations Headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The idea of holding a South Summit within the framework of G-
77 was formally proposed at the organization's Conference on Trade,
Investment and Finance held in Costa Rica in 1997. This proposal
was endorsed by the 21st Ministerial Meeting of G-77 in September
1997 in New York, which was followed by detailed discussions at
the Consultative Meeting for High-level Officials on the South
Summit in Jarkata, capital of Indonesia, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
During the 53rd General Assembly Session in the United Nations
Headquarters in New York, the Cuban offer to host the historic
event was formalized and was officially accepted by G-77 at its
22nd Ministerial Meeting.
</P>
<P>
After the beginning of the preparatory process, a clear
emphasis has been placed on the development of a clear and
concrete plan of action that will constitute the new agenda for
the developing South. The Havana Summit is aimed at restoring the
commitment of the G-77 Member States to a new economic platform
for the South.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the South Summit is the first of G-77's such
conferences at summit level in its 36-year history. The South
Summit is scheduled to focus on four themes: globalization of the
world economy, the North-South relations, South-South cooperation,
and knowledge and technology.
</P>
<P>
The first three themes were proposed by Cuba while Pakistan
suggested the last one. The South Summit will be held in
accordance with the following schedule: senior government
officials will meet on April 10, one day before the meeting of
foreign ministers. Heads of state and government are expected to
meet for three days beginning on April 12.
</P>
<P>
The agenda will thus reflect the enormous global challenges
facing developing countries. There will also be a special emphasis
on developing specific follow-up machinery to carry forward the
outcome of the summit.
</P>
<P>
From the South Summit will emerge two final documents. The
first, a forward-looking declaration, will set out a vision and
broad strategy for the future while the second action-oriented
document will clearly define measures, targets and time frames for
implementation. It is hoped that as a logical consequence of the
discussions, appropriate follow-up machinery will be agreed upon
to implement the objectives in Havana.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 heads of state have confirmed their attendance
with half of them coming from Africa. Some 80 international
organizations and 56 non-members of the Group of 77, including
China, are also invited to the coming summit.
</P>
<P>
The summit, to be held under the chairmanship of Nigeria, will
also be an occasion for developing countries to galvanize their
strength and solidarity into a truly energetic force capable of
conditioning the international economic order in which the Group
of 77 must operate.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Group of 77, Largest Body of Developing Countries  (by Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 77 (G-77) will hold
its first ever summit, known as the South Summit, at the Palacio
de Convention in Havana, capital of Cuba, on April 10-14. The
historic event will be the South's largest gathering of heads of
state and government from its current members of 133 developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
G-77 was founded on June 15, 1964 by 77 developing countries,
all of which were signatories to the "Joint Declaration of the
Seventy-Seven Countries" issued at the end of the first session of
the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Beginning with the first Ministerial Meeting of G-77 in
Algeria in 1967, which adopted the Charter of Algiers, a permanent
institutional structure gradually developed into a body which led
to the creation of Chapters of G-77 in Rome (FAO), Vienna (UNIDO),
Paris (UNESCO), Nairobi (UNEP) and the Group of 25 in Washington (
IMF and the World Bank).
</P>
<P>
Although the membership of G-77 has nearly doubled to 133
countries, the original name was retained because of its historic
significance.
</P>
<P>
As the largest Third World coalition in the United Nations and
the largest grouping in the South, G-77 provides the means for the
developing world to articulate and promote its collective economic
interests and enhance its joining negotiating capacity on all
major international economic issues in the United Nations system,
and promote economic and technical cooperation among developing
nations.
</P>
<P>
The organization and modalities of work of G-77 in the various
chapters have certain minimal features in common such as a
similarity in membership, decision-making and certain operating
methods. The group's work in each chapter is coordinated by a
chairman who acts as its spokesman. The chairman rotates on a
regional basis among Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean,
and is held for one year in all the chapters.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Nigeria holds the chairmanship of G-77 in New York
for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
In G-77, the Ministerial Meeting is the supreme decision-
making body which meets annually at the beginning of the regular
session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York and periodically
in preparation for UNTACD sessions and the General Conference of
UNIDO and UNESCO.
</P>
<P>
The Intergovernmental Follow-up and Coordination Committee on
Economic Cooperation among Developing Countries (IFCC) is a
plenary body consisting of senior officials which meets once every
two years to review the state of implementation on the Caracas
Program of Action adopted by G-77 in 1981. The IFCC was last
convened in Manila in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The past major events of the group, which, together with all
other activities of the body, were financed through contributions
by member states. They include the creation of joint declarations,
actions and agreements on specific agenda topics such as the
Algiers Charter 1967, the Lima Declaration 1971, the Cairo
Declaration in 1986, and the Havana Declaration in 1987, and the
Ministerial Statement on the South Summit in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries face the challenge of formulating a
common vision and a new platform for collective action in order to
achieve their shared concerns and objectives. The upcoming South
Summit will be a unique opportunity to renew the South's
commitment to defining an action plan with clear targets and a
time frame for its effective implementation.
</P>
<P>
G-77 is the largest Third World coalition in the United
Nations and serves as a focal point for the developing world to
promote its collective interests and enhance its joint negotiating
capacity on international economic issues.

MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Russia's chief representative at
the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly (PACE) Sunday called
for the severing of all official contacts with the PACE.
</P>
<P>
Dmitry Rogozin, who headed the Russian parliamentary delegation

where Russian troops are fighting separatists.
</P>
<P>
"The parliamentary assembly must revise its decision on our
delegation," Rogozin told the RTR television. "Until they do this,
we won't maintain any official contacts with them."
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the Russian State Duma,
or lower house of parliament, will hold a meeting of leaders of
various political groups in parliament to consider a reaction,
Rogozin said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Opposition to Challenge Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Morgan Tsvangirai, president of
Zimbabwe's opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC),
Sunday admitted that he is in alliance with the whites in a bid to
challenge the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (Zanu-pf).
</P>
<P>
He told about 3,000 people at a campaign rally in Norton,
nearly 40 kilometers west of Harare, that whites were important
because they created employment.
</P>
<P>
He said, "We are going to take whites because they are creating
jobs. We should not have any grudge against the whites because
they are creating the jobs we need."
</P>
<P>
All the policies for the MDC were centred on employment
creation which gave the whites an important role to play in the
Zimbabwean economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
A number of organizations, including the Zanu-pf, have been
criticizing Tsvangirai for getting support from the white
community.
</P>
<P>
President Robert Mugabe took a swipe at Tsvangirai at a rally
in Mashonaland Central last week, saying that he was a puppet for
white people who wanted to colonize the country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is set to hold its fifth parliamentary elections in
May and political analysts are already pointing at the MDC which
is supported by the trade unions as the main challenger to
Zanu-pf's 20-year political dominance.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai told the rally that if elected into power, the MDC
would prioritize poverty alleviation, job creation, eradicating
corruption, establishing a viable land policy and reduction of
the national debt.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's $259 Million Hydroelectric Project in Progress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is speeding up to
build the Gilgel Gibe Hydroelectric Power Project launched in
Jimma, about 300 kilometers southwest of Addis Ababa, the project
manager Banella Alberto said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The project, which was kicked off nine months ago with an
outlay of over 259 million U.S. dollars, is under construction by
Italian and Spanish companies, Banella said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,300 construction workers and technicians are
involved in the construction that consists of a tunnel and a dam.
</P>
<P>
The 9.2 kilometer tunnel that stretches from the dam to the
turbine is under construction while the 717 million cubic meter
water dam is being built on 30 hectares of land, Banella said,
noting that the total construction of the dam and tunnel would be
completed by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
According to the manager, about 40 million U.S. dollars have so
far been spent on the project, including the already imported
construction materials and equipment.
</P>
<P>
Upon being operational in 2004, the 184 mega watt project is
expected to produce 45 percent of the country's total power
supply.
</P>
<P>
The world and European investment banks cover 190 million and
46 million U.S. dollars respectively and Ethiopia finances the
balance cost of the project.

<HEADLINE> World Conference on Endangered Species Opens in Nairobi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Li Jinqi, Sun Huixia
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The 11th Conference of the Parties
to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species
(CITES) was opened here Sunday with some 2,000 officials from over
100 countries attending.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting, the first of the forty meetings to be held in
the 21st century, will determine the direction in which the
convention will go, or not go, in the years to come," Secretary
General of CITES Willem Wijnstekers said in his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which ends on April 20, is expected to
establish a strategic plan to guide CITES through the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
"The convention will have been in force for 25 years in July
this year, which makes CITES one of the oldest multilateral
environmental agreements," said Wijnstekers.
</P>
<P>
With its 151 parties and vast field of activity, it has also
been one of the conventions with the most direct impact on
species conservation, Wijnstekers said.
</P>
<P>
The conference will consider 62 proposals tabled by member
nations to amend the lists of species subject to trade controls or
bans. The proposals cover over 50 groups of species, ranging from
the African elephant and the minke whale to Malagasy poison frogs
and the monkey puzzle tree.
</P>
<P>
The most high-profile issue in this conference is whether or
not to authorize annual sales of ivory from Botswana, Namibia,
Zimbabwe and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The four southern African countries have proposed to downlist
elephants in these nations from Appendix I, which bans all trade
in the species, to Appendix II, which allows regulated trade.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenya and India have demanded a total ban on ivory
trade, saying that even the partial lift of the ivory ban would
increase poaching cases greatly.
</P>
<P>
The issue of whales is also the hotspot. Japan and Norway have
suggested to transfer four species of whales from Appendix I to
Appendix II.
</P>
<P>
Similar proposals were rejected by CITES in 1997. All
commercial whaling has been banned by the International Whaling
Commission since 1986.
</P>
<P>
CITES was adopted in 1973 and came into force in 1975. About
146 countries have signed the treaty, making it one of the world's
most important agreements on conservation and sustainable use.

ADDIS ABABA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia will take new
measures to encourage private sector to get involved in economic
development in the country, the Ministry of Trade and Industry has
said.
</P>
<P>
The government is to implement a program entitled "Boost the

<HEADLINE> Iran Sees Defense Cooperation With Saudi Arabia on Right Path </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani said here on Sunday that Iran's defense cooperation with
Saudi Arabia is on the right and logical track.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are determined to pursue a step-by-step
expansion in diplomatic relations and avoid rushing into
cooperation, Shamkhani said after meeting visiting Omani Air Force
Commander Mohammad Bin Mahfuz al-Arazi.
</P>
<P>
He also termed Iran's policy of detente with the Persian Gulf
littoral states, which was advocated by reformist President
Mohammad Khatami, as the most important factor in ensuring the
success of the country's defense policy.
</P>
<P>
Common cultural and political values as well as security
concerns among the countries can be a basis for peace and security
in the region, the minister said
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani added that invited by his Saudi counterpart Prince
Sultan Ibn Abdul-Aziz, he will visit the country in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
He said the trip is a return visit to the Saudi defense
minister's visit to Iran last year, adding that defense and
security issues will feature prominently in his talks with Saudi
officials.
</P>
<P>
During Prince Sultan's visit to Iran last year, the two
countries agreed to exchange military attaches.
</P>
<P>
Iranian-Saudi relations have steadily improved since President
Khatami came to power in 1997. The two countries went through years
of mutual suspicion following Iran's Islamic Revolution in 1979.

<HEADLINE> UK's Productivity Affected By Strong Sterling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Britain's industry productivity
growth is slowing in both manufacturing and services, according to
a new survey.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Management Services (IMS) productivity index
released Sunday shows a second successive monthly drop, indicating
a productivity slow-down.
</P>
<P>
The index fell to 56.3 last month from 56.6 in February and 57.
7 in January. Falling productivity growth occurred in both
services and manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
IMS spokesman John Lucey said, "The manufacturing sector
continues to wrestle with strong overseas competition and the
strength of sterling."
</P>
<P>
"Companies are finding it very difficult to reduce costs
further. Given this and the time lag for improvements to take
effect, the rate of growth of productivity is expected to fall
further," he added.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that other business surveys will confirm that
the pound's strength is giving industry a "torrid time."

<HEADLINE> Growth In Eurozone Fails To Boost Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Reuters eurozone output index,
produced by NTC Research, suggests that European economies moved
up a gear last month, to their strongest in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The index rose from 59 to 61 (levels above 50 indicate
expansion) with more rapid growth in both manufacturing and
services.
</P>
<P>
For those who believe that a currency's performance should
reflect relative economic growth rates, the euro's continued
weakness is puzzling.
</P>
<P>
The rapid growth was confirmed by German manufacturing orders
for February, which showed a jump of 4.7 percent on the month and
a 12.5 percent rise on a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The European commission reported that euroland industrial
confidence rose last month, with the balance of employers more
optimistic about prospects at 4 compared with 3 in February.
</P>
<P>
The Reuters index also shows that the consumer confidence
balance, at zero, was at its highest since monetary union started
in January 1999.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Talks Make No Progress: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Sunday the ongoing Palestinian-
Israeli peace talks in Washington were "just chat" and have made no
progress so far, said a senior Egyptian official.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process is in crisis and the current
situation is more precarious than it has been for years, Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa told reporters after a meeting between Mubarak
and Arafat, who has left Cairo following a lightening visit.
</P>
<P>
"President Arafat said that there is no progress in the
discussions currently taking place in Washington, which he
described as a mere chat," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators began a new round of talks
Friday at Bolling Air Force base in southeast Washington. They are
working to meet a May deadline to forge a formula for a final peace
treaty to be completed by September. Agreement is needed on thorny
issues including borders, the fate of Jewish settlements, the
status of Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
Both Syria and Lebanon have also expressed alarm at an Israeli
plan for a unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon by July, which
they say could trigger new regional violence.
</P>
<P>
"All of this forms a big crisis in the peace process on the
different tracks. This has not been the situation for a while, even
in the period of the former (Israeli) government," which was blamed
for the lack of progress in the Mideast peace process due to its
hardline policy, Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Arafat told Mubarak about the "brutality" of
Israel's settlement policy in the West Bank, where the Palestinians
want to build a state.
</P>
<P>
"In the last nine months more than 7,000 housing units have been
built in addition to 4,000 others that have been implemented
recently," Moussa quoted Arafat as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli settlement policy, which has caused grave concerns,
has been a major obstacle to the progress of the Palestinian-
Israeli peace talks, he said.

<P>
ANKARA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's population is expected to
rise to 66.213 million in the middle of year 2000 and to 70 million
in 2005, said the State Institute of Statistics (DIE).
</P>
<P>
DIE predicted that the population is expected to grow further by
8.7 percent to 71.944 million in 2007, the Anatolia News Agency
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Antalya, a famous southern resort city, is expected to record
the highest growth rate in the coming years. The city, with a
population of 1.661 million at present, is expected to see its
population rise by 26.8 percent to 2.105 million in 2007.
</P>
<P>
Istanbul, the biggest city of Turkey, which has a population of
9.998 million, will witness the figure up by 23.3 percent to 12.324
million in 2007.
</P>
<P>

turn: Istanbul with 9,998,109, Ankara, the capital of Turkey with
3,868,633 and Izmir, a northwest resort, with 3,277,195.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait, U.S. to Cement Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti Deputy Prime Minister
and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Al-Sabah said Sunday that his
meeting with visiting U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen dealt
with means of boosting military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Salem said the talks focused on a joint plan to enhance
Kuwaiti army performance including joint war games, the Kuwait News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti and U.S. forces are currently conducting an annual
exercise dubbed as "Eager Mace 2000", which started on April 1 and
will end on April 25.
</P>
<P>
The joint maneuver, which includes amphibious, ground, air and
naval trainings, is "aimed to strengthen military-to-military
relations, improve readiness and interoperability between the two
armed forces."
</P>
<P>
But the Kuwaiti defense chief did not mention whether he
discussed with his U.S. counterpart a U.S. proposed Gulf
cooperative defense plan.
</P>
<P>
After watching the Kuwait-U.S. military exercise at a Kuwaiti
range on Saturday, Cohen said that his talks with Kuwaiti and other
Gulf leaders were centering on a "cooperative defense initiative"
designed to deter possible chemical and biological attacks on any
of the Gulf Arab states as well as the U.S. forces stationed in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the Gulf states will join in the U.S.-
proposed defense plan, which he said includes the building of an
early warning system.
</P>
<P>
Washington had in the past two yeas been seeking an approval
from the Gulf leaderships to share the early warning system with
the U.S. forces. But the response from most of the Gulf states
appeared to be lukewarm.
</P>
<P>
Cohen has left for Saudi Arabia after concluding a two-day visit
here earlier Sunday. Before visiting Kuwait, Cohen had flied to
Qatar and Bahrain.

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Military Cooperation Among Gulf Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani on Sunday stressed the importance of military cooperation
among Gulf countries in safeguarding regional security.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of all-out cooperation among Persian Gulf states
is the main pillar of establishing security and stability in the
region, Shamkhani told visiting Omani Air Force Commander Mohammad
Bin Mahfuz al-Arazi.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that defense-related cooperation between
Tehran and Muscat could set a good example for such cooperation
between Iran and other Gulf states, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani also called on regional states to carry on confidence-
building and joint cooperation to secure their common interests.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, al-Arazi said that Oman attaches great importance to
the expansion of all-out relations with Iran, adding that the
implementation of defense agreements between the two countries was
fully successful.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed between Iran and Oman in November
1998, military experts of the two countries will be present at
joint military exercises as observers every year.
</P>
<P>
Al-Arazi, who arrived here on Friday with a high-ranking
military delegation, also met his Iranian counterpart Habib Baqa'i
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, Baqa'i said that Iran is ready to transfer
technological know-how to the Omani air force and help modernize
Oman's defense system, said the report.

<HEADLINE> Ozone Predicted 6 Percent Less Over Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Environment Canada scientists
predict that the average ozone coverage over Canada will be 6
percent less than normal for the period of May through August 2000.
</P>
<P>
Citing the warning of the department, the Toronto Sun newspaper
said Sunday that the thinner ozone layer is expected to increase
the ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation reaching earth by 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Its depletion is believed to increase the incidence of skin
cancers and cataracts.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is based on recent data from Canadian ozone
stations and satellites showing severe ozone depletion over the
Arctic, according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"These episodes of depletion are more frequent and severe due
to global warming. People shouldn't be alarmed, but prudent about
overexposure to UV," Dr. David Wardle of the department was quoted
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Canada saw its worst year of ozone depletion in 1993, when
ozone levels were averaged 7.5 percent below normal while UV-B
radiation increased 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader Invites Middlesbrough Football Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Colonel Muammar
Gaddafi has invited English premier league side Middlesbrough to
play his national soccer team, the Sunday Times reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi was willing to offer Middlesbrough one million pounds(1.
58 million U.S. dollars) for playing, as well as insurance costs
estimated at six million pounds (9.48 million U.S. dollars), in a
bid to lift Libya's soccer profile, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the newspaper, the unprecedented away match was
made possible after British foreign secretary Robin Cook lifted
Britain's trade sanctions on Libya following the handover for
trial of two suspects charged with the bombing of Pan Am flight
103, which crashed over Lockerbie in 1988 killing 270 passengers.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Times said that the Football Association, the sport'
s governing body in England, had expressed concerns about the
fixture but quoted a Middlesbrough spokesman as saying the British
government would not oppose the trip.
</P>
<P>
"The Libyan embargo has been lifted," the spokesman said."We
have spoken to our local MP, Stuart Bell, and he has discussed the
trip with the government. They have no problems."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Italian Serie A club Bari would also
be playing in Libya. No dates were given for the tours.
</P>
<P>
Middlesbrough's best-known players are former England
midfielder Paul Gascoigne, Brazilian Juninho and Germany's
Christian Ziege. The team is coached by former England captain
Bryan Robson.
</P>
<P>
If the match does go ahead Middlesbrough's players will find
themselves playing against the Libyan leader's son, Al-Saadi, who
has become an automatic choice in the national side.

<HEADLINE> Barak Not Optimistic about Breakthrough with Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
said Sunday that he is not optimistic about chances of reviving the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly cabinet meeting Sunday morning, Barak
confirmed he will discuss with U.S. President Bill Clinton during
their Washington summit on Tuesday about new peace ideas from
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, the summit will focus mainly on the Israeli-
Palestinian final-status talks and the planned Israeli troops
withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
45-month deadlock, grounded to a halt in January due to their
differences over the fate of the Golan Heights, the strategic
plateau Israel occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The latest effort to renew the talks, a summit between Clinton
and Assad in Geneva on March 26, failed to break the deadlock.
Since then, Clinton has asserted that the ball is in Syria's court
and he is waiting for Syrian response to Israel's proposals he
conveyed during the summit.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, White House officials revealed that the U.S. had
received oral responses from Assad through U.S. embassy in
Damascus, without elaborating the content of Assad's response.
</P>
<P>
The officials also announced a meeting between Clinton and Barak
to push forward the Middle East peace process, which prompted some
analysts to predict that the change in the Syrian position would
lead to a breakthrough on the Israeli-Syrian peace track.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli officials have been trying to play down the
expectation. Barak's Security Adviser Danny Yatom said that there
is no drama expected in the Barak-Clinton summit.
</P>
<P>
On a related issue, Israel Radio Sunday morning quoted a senior
French diplomat as saying that Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will
carry out the pullout from South Lebanon as soon as mid-May.
</P>
<P>
In response, Barak revealed that the inner-circle security
cabinet will convene soon to decide on the exact date for the
Israeli troops withdrawal form south Lebanon, which is originally
due to take place by July.
</P>
<P>
Barak's declaration, although stopped short of endorsing the
prediction, showed that his patience to wait for a peace
arrangement for the withdrawal has been worn out.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli cabinet endorsed Barak's proposal to
withdraw from the buffer zone, set up in 1985 with a self-claimed
aim of preventing cross-border guerrilla attacks on its north, with
or without a peace deal with Syria, the major power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
In the event that conditions will not conducive to a
redeployment within the framework of an agreement with Syria, the
cabinet will convene at an appropriate time to discuss the method
of a unilateral pullback, a cabinet resolution said then.
</P>
<P>
Israel officials had hoped the prospect of a unilateral Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon would make Syrians lose the last
bargaining chip for its demanded return of the Golan Heights and
pressure them back to the negotiating table with Israel.
</P>
<P>
As the strategy is of no avail till now, it is rumored recently
that IDF will carry out the pullout as soon as possible. In the
context, some officials said that the withdrawal will be
implemented surely not exactly in July, but several weeks before
the deadline.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile on the Palestinian track, Barak announced that he is
planning to set up a ministerial steering committee in the coming
days for negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are currently in intensive
talks at Bolling Air Force Base near Washington on the final-status
issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, borders, the future of
Jewish settlements on occupied land and the return of Palestinian
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The talks were resumed on last Thursday after a round of "
brainstorming session" between them last month failed to make any
visible progress.
</P>
<P>
According to a compromise plan between the two sides, they
should reach a framework agreement by May and a final accord on
permanent peace by September 13.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks till now is tough and it appears that the
deadline is too ambitious. U.S. State spokesman James Rubin said
Friday that the gaps still remain and there's an enormous amount of
work to be done to overcome them.
</P>
<P>
Arafat complained at his weekly cabinet meeting on Friday night
that Israel has not participated effectively in the talks and
called on the U.S. to use its influence on Israel to push the
negotiations ahead.
</P>
<P>
To resolve the difficulties, Barak is due to meet Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak, another major Mideast peace mediator
besides Clinton, in Cairo on Monday on his way to Washington to
coordinate stands on all the fronts of peace process. The Egyptian
president also met with Arafat on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Preparing Cabinet Reshuffle, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
has started reviewing the performances of his ministers in order to
reshuffle his cabinet, Cooperatives Minister Morteza Haji revealed
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The basis for such a reshuffle will be a comparison of the
ministers' records with their platforms forwarded in the form of a
pamphlet to Majlis (parliament) representatives while obtaining a
vote of confidence, Haji said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after his visit to the headquarters of the Islamic
Republic News Agency, the pro-reformist minister said that the
degree of the ministers' contribution to the cabinet's decision-
making will be another criteria in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly, the president will study the differences between the
ministers' performance and platforms, and he will examine whether
the difference, if any, is the result of external factors," he
explained.
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily Tehran Times said on Wednesday that the
Iranian reformists are pressing President Khatami to make a cabinet
reshuffle by removing ministers who are not fully coordinated with
them.
</P>
<P>
Following the overwhelming victory in the key parliamentary
elections on February 18, the reformist party of the Islamic Iran
Participation Front (IIPF) headed by the president's younger
brother Mohammad Reza Khatami, has put cabinet reshuffle on its
agenda, an unidentified informed source told the daily.
</P>
<P>
The current Iranian cabinet which was formed in August 1997 is a
coalition of the IIPF, the centralist Party of Constructive
Executives of Iran (PCEI) and the leftist Assembly of Combatant
Clergy in Tehran (ACC), which helped President Khatami win the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
However, the relations between the IIPF and the PCEI soured
before the February parliamentary elections as the IIPF strongly
opposed the participation of former President Hashemi Rafsanjani
while the PCEI supported Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
Haji rejected the suggestion that any factional pressures would
affect Khatami's decision on the cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that the government has plans to merge the
Agriculture Ministry with the Construction Jihad Ministry and the
Industries Ministry with the Ministry of Mines and Metals.
</P>
<P>
A merger of the Plan and Budget Organization and the State
Organization for Employment and Administrative Affairs has been
ratified, he said, adding that President Khatami would appoint the
head of the new organization by April 19.

The commentator also asks Annette Lu to learn the elementary
knowledge of Chinese history and geography, all of which clearly
shows that Taiwan is a part of China, and that this can never be
changed. The article points out that the temporary separation
between Taiwan and the mainland will inevitably come to an end.
</P>
<P>
Anyone attempting to carry out a Taiwan independence policy is
doomed to fail, it says.
</P>
<P>
The commentary cites President Jiang Zemin as saying that the
basis and prerequisite for talks and dialogue between the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits is the one-China principle that can
not be challenged, no matter who is the leader in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Only on the basis of the one-China principle could Taiwan have
a bright future. Annette Lu challenges the 1.25 billion Chinese
people who stand behind the one-China principle, and she intends
to push Taiwan into the abyss of war, it warns.
</P>
<P>
"Are the 2.3 million Taiwan people at ease that such a lunatic
advocate of Taiwan independence, who could bring disaster to
Taiwan at any time, has taken office as a Taiwan leader?" asks the
commentary.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Tomorrow's People's Daily will
carry a commentary strongly refuting statements made by Annette Lu,
a member of the Taiwan-based Democratic Progressive Party,
advocating independence for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
On completion of the Taiwan regional election, the Chinese
government and leaders reiterated that peaceful reunification
should be based on the one-China principle, says the commentary.
</P>
<P>
"We are paying close attention to which direction the new
leaders of Taiwan will take," continues the commentary.
</P>
<P>
Some extremists who do not want to see the cross-straits
relationship head toward peaceful reunification have intentionally
fabricated various stories aimed to separate China. Annette Lu is
the most notorious, it says.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with a Hong Kong cable TV station, she
openly advocated Taiwan independence, which challenged the one-
China policy and stirred animosity between the people on both
sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
Lu wrongly advocated Taiwan independence and even tried to
rationalize Japan's occupation of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the relationship between the mainland and Taiwan
should be that of "remote relatives" in terms of history and when
geographical factors are considered, their relationship is that of
"close neighbors."

<HEADLINE> Gale Winds, Sandstorm to Affect Yangtze River Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The strong, cold air dominating
Beijing right now will leave north China later this evening and
move south to the Yangtze River area, China's Central
Meteorological Station reported.
</P>
<P>
According to meteorologists, the sandstorm which blasted
Beijing two days ago has moved to parts of Hebei and Liaoning
provinces, which are suffering fresh breeze to moderate gale.
</P>
<P>
However, thanks to last night's light snow in the eastern part
of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the northern area of Hebei
Province, the sandstorm in Beijing is subsiding.
</P>
<P>
But the sandstorm in part of Gansu, Shaanxi, Ningxia and Inner
Mongolia shows no sign of letting up, the experts noted.
</P>
<P>
With the coming cold air, areas downstream of the Yellow River
will experience strong gale winds and sandstorms in the next few
days. Light to moderate rain will fall on southern China.
</P>
<P>
The experts also predicted that another cold air current will
hit northern China on April 12 or 13.

<HEADLINE> Barak to meet Egyptian President on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
is scheduled to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo
Monday to discuss Mideast peace processes, Barak's office announced
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The summit meeting comes when Barak stops over in Cairo before
traveling on to Washington to meet United States President Bill
Clinton Tuesday, a statement issued by Barak's office said.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Barak's office revealed that the two leaders are
expected to discuss all fronts of the peace process in general and
the Israeli-Palestinian track in particular.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak held talks with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat at Mubarak's Itihadiya palace Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle-diplomacy came following a U.S. surprise
announcement Saturday night that U.S. President Bill Clinton will
meet Barak on Tuesday and Arafat on April 20.
</P>
<P>
Israeli and Palestinian negotiators are in intensive talks at
Bolling Air Force Base near Washington on the final-status issues.
The talks resumed last Thursday after a round of brainstorming
session last month failed to make any visible progress.
</P>
<P>
The Washington talks aim to pave the way for the conclusion of a
framework agreement by May and a final permanent peace treaty by
September between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Arafat complained at his weekly cabinet meeting Friday night
that Israel had not participated effectively in the talks and
called on the U.S. to use its influence on Israel to push the
negotiations ahead.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak will also try to coordinate stands with Mubarak
on the stalled Israeli-Syrian peace talks, which broke off again in
January, and the planned Israeli troops withdrawal from south
Lebanon, which is due to take place by July.
</P>
<P>
Since the botched summit meeting between Clinton and his Syrian
counterpart Hafez al-Assad in Geneva on March 26, Mubarak had been
the major mediator between Israel and Syria. He had traveled to
Washington to meet with Clinton on March 28.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, as the biggest Arab power in the Middle East region and
the first Arab country to sign peace deals with Israel, keeps warm
relations with all the sides in the Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-
Lebanese peace tracks.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak exchanges views on the peace process in Cairo on
Saturday with Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh, who said, for
the first time, after the meeting that Syria would welcome a
unilateral Israeli pullback from the so-called security zone in
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Lebanon and Syria, the major power broker in Lebanon,
hinted that Israeli withdrawal from the buffer area without peace
agreements with them would lead to cross-border attacks against
Israeli northern settlements along the border.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials leaked Saturday that Syria had made some
responses to Israel's peace proposal which was conveyed to al-Assad
through Clinton during their Geneva summit.
</P>
<P>
It was suggested that the new idea from Syria was one of the
reasons that led to the scheduled Barak-Clinton summit, although
the gaps between Israel and Syria, according to U.S. officials,
have still not been narrowed so far.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks, which resumed last December after a
45-month break, hit a snag again only after two rounds of talks
near Washington due to differences over the return of the Golan
Heights, the strategic plateau Israel occupied since the 1967
Middle East war.

DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A high-level expert committee was
formed Sunday to recommend measures in two months to save Dhaka
from environmental disaster, an official handout said here.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which was formed at a meeting of the National
Environment Committee, will help fix government policies on
commercial and residential high-rise buildings in Dhaka in the
backdrop of growing concern about unplanned infrastructural
development in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for Environment H.N. Ashiqur Rahman will chair
the committee which comprises environmental experts and city
planners who have been asked to submit their report in two months
for government decision.
</P>
<P>
The expert committee will also review the environmental court
act and environmental laws, and submit their report to the
National Environment Committee before its next meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Environment earlier said there was no scope
to allow construction of high-rise buildings any further in Dhaka
under the Environmental Rules 1997 despite the actual demands.
</P>
<P>
Experts and environment officials have long been complaining
that unplanned constructions were creating extra pressure on the
city's sewerage systems, causing water stagnation and traffic
congestion.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obansanjo Sunday left for Cuba to attend the G-77 summit by a
commercial flight, giving an embarrassing sign of a row between
the presidency and parliament over the replenishment of the
presidential jet.
</P>
<P>
His spokesman said earlier in Abuja that President Fidel Castro
had even offered to send a plane to pick up President Obasanjo,
but that this offer had been politely turned down.
</P>
<P>
The assembly has been blockinng a request from the president to
buy a new airbus from the Sultan of Brunei for about 80 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The president said he needs a new plane for his Boeing 727 was
too old and violating new anti-noise pollution laws covering
European and American skies.
</P>
<P>
The national assembly said the request for 80 million dollars
was extravagant and instead authorized money to rehabilitate the
Boeing 727.
</P>
<P>
This reflected the growing disputes between the president of
Africa's most populous country, and its top legislature, said
some observers.
</P>
<P>
The assembly had been accusing the president of alleged
behaviors like a military ruler, who thinks he can push them
around.
</P>
<P>
The president's supporters accused the assembly of having more
concerns in its own welfare than that of the nation.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the passage of the year 2000 budget had long been
delayed by the assembly and not signed by the president.
</P>
<P>
To the president's anger, his own version was amended by the
assembly, which is reported to have taken the initiative of
awarding itself some 280 million dollars for its own expenditure.

<HEADLINE> Western China Becomes Cradle of Men of Wealth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Twentysomething Han Jun started his
career as a general manager in the Xi'an New and High-tech
Development Zone with the attitude that anyone can become a
millionaire.
</P>
<P>
"I came here just in a pair of cloth shoes two years ago," Han
said, standing in front of the gleaming new office building of the
Xinli IC Company Ltd. "Now I have enough money to buy 100 Mercedes
Benz cars."
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old graduated from Xi'an Jiaotong University in
1997 with a degree in computer science.
</P>
<P>
He grew up poor, and dreamed of wealth. "My father failed to
save the amount of money for a Benz car throughout his life. In my
view, it is not too difficult to become a millionaire in two years,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Like Han, many of Xi'an's nouveau riche live in eye-catching
luxury apartments in a southern suburb of the provincial capital
of northwest China's Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
And like Han, many people in China are hanging their hopes on
the development of the west now that the Chinese government has
launched its program to speed up economic growth in the resource-
rich but underdeveloped region.
</P>
<P>
The western region is comprised of nine provinces and
autonomous regions and one municipality, with a total area of 5.4
million square kilometers and a population of 285 million,
accounting for the nation's 56 percent and 23 percent,
respectively. However, its per-capita gross domestic product (GDP)
is much lower than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Province took steps this year to keep its talented
college graduates working at home. Though some 20,000 graduating
students in the province said they wanted to work in Shanghai,
Guangzhou and other big cities in eastern and southern China,
almost the same number have vowed to make their fortune out of the
western region.

<HEADLINE> Western China Becomes Cradle of Men of Wealth (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So many migrant workers headed west this year that Xi'an's
suburban population now outnumbers that of the city proper.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Lisheng, a native of east China's Shandong Province,
settled in Xi'an after graduating from a university in Shanghai. "
Shaanxi will become China's largest highway communication hub in
the next decade. As a highway designer, I can benefit enormously
from such a large project," he said.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that the average monthly income of
residents in Xi'an is still half of the amount earned in Shanghai,
China's leading industrial center.
</P>
<P>
"I believe the gap will be narrowed soon when the drive to
revive western China reaches its goal and the local people's
mindset about development changes," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Rong, a professor at Northwest China University, said the
western region maintains superiority over certain eastern
provinces in terms of technical personnel, historical sites and
natural resources. He said the strategy of accelerating western
development gives people from all walks of life the chance to make
money.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps someone like Bill Gates will emerge in western China
in a few years," he said, referring to the president of computer
giant Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
Koji Kadowaki, president of Guangzhou-Hongda Automobile Co. Ltd.
, said his company recently set up a sales center in Xi'an, the
first of its kind in western China, as more people in the region
will have the resources to buy their own cars.
</P>
<P>
Improvement of the ecological environment is high on the agenda
of western development, and the move will fatten the bank accounts
of many people in the region. Hui Jingpeng, a 46-year-old from Xi'
an, has contracted 200 hectares of sandy area in the Mu Us desert
to build a farm, and expects his yearly income to hit three
million yuan.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Valley Built in W China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in the Xi'an New and High-
tech Development Zone are busy designing the latest aeroengine
</P>
<P>
A few kilometers away from their laboratory and workshop in
northwest China's Shaanxi Province stand the tombs of 72 emperors
from 13 ancient dynasties and the world-renowned terra cotta
warriors.
</P>
<P>
Xi'an, the capital of Shaanxi, has become a curious blend of
the past and the future with the stepped-up development of western
China. The city has established four new and high-tech development
zones and a high-tech agriculture experiment zone, and is home to
a mighty contingent of scientists and technicians.
</P>
<P>
"This ancient capital city has served as the cradle of ancient
civilization and the birthplace of many 'firsts' in China -- the
first carrier rocket engine, the first color TV kinescope, the
first integrated circuit and the first civilian plane," said Sun
Haiying, director of the Shaanxi Provincial Commission of Science
and Technology, speaking at a trade fair of investment and
cooperation between east and west China, which closed today.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi has more than 90,000 scientists and engineers, 850,000
technicians and over 1,000 research institutes, which score
thousands of research achievements annually, yielding at least 100
billion yuan in revenue, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
New and high-tech sectors will be an important feature of
western China's economic growth. Experience in the United States
and Japan shows that high-tech development is the key to success,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Andong, the provincial governor, pledged that Shaanxi
will give top priority to high-tech research.
</P>
<P>
"We will make full use of local technical personnel and will
work to turn the new and high-tech development zone in central
Shaanxi into a 'Silicon Valley' in western China," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Urges Rectification of Government Malfeasance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A national conference was held in
this capital city of Southwestern China's Yunnan Province from
April 6 to 8 to find ways to stop malfeasance in certain
government departments and some trades.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said in a letter to the meeting that
in response to public outcry against misconduct by government
officials and professionals, more must be done to improve
education and supervision of the individuals and groups involved.
</P>
<P>
The illegal activities included unreasonable levies on farmers
and enterprises, random fees collected along highways and from
school children, and "black box" operations in the purchase and
sales of medicine, Zhu said in his letter.
</P>
<P>
A special office was set up in the State Council ten years ago
to begin work on rectifying governmental and trade misconduct, and
this work has been an important part of the anti-corruption fight,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, He Yong, head of the State Council
misconduct rectification office, said that China will take four
measures this year to ensure changes in the government work style:
people involved in improper activities will be exposed by the
media; a detailed system will be instituted by government
departments at all levels to prevent malfeasance; the misconduct
rectification work shall be placed under public scrutiny; and
leading officials will be held responsible for wrongdoing in
departments or trade under their control.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Clinton Asks Barak For Summit? (By Qi Deliang) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The surprise announcement on
Saturday that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will travel to
Washington for a summit Tuesday with U.S. President Bill Clinton,
at the latter's request, almost caught everybody off guard.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the situation in the region, the upcoming summit
between Clinton and Barak is most probably to be centered on the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the two leaders are expected to discuss the Syrian
track in the aftermath of Clinton's meeting last month in Geneva
with Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad and Israel's decision to
withdraw its troops from south Lebanon by July this year.
</P>
<P>
Israel's peace talks with Syria, being stalled since January
after two rounds of talks in the United States beginning at the end
of last December, appear to be heading toward resumption.
</P>
<P>
The White House said Saturday that it had received oral answers
from Assad to Israeli peace proposals concerning the return to
Syria of the Golan Heights which Israel occupied during the 1967
Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly told Clinton before the Geneva summit that he
wanted to keep a small swathe of the territory on the eastern shore
of the Kinneret (Sea of Galilee), but would be willing to
compensate Assad with tracks of land elsewhere near the Golan.
</P>
<P>
In another surprise development, which seemed to suggest a
change in the Syrian position, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh
in Cairo Saturday publicly welcomed, for first time, Israel's
decision to unilaterally withdraw from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
He said Syria and Lebanon support the withdrawal which he said
is considered a victory for the Lebanese resistance and all Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Syria has until now feared that a unilateral Israeli withdrawal
could weaken its bargaining position in its quest to regain the
Golan and hinted that Israel would continue to suffer cross-border
attacks after the pullout without a peace settlement with Syria,
the main power broker in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Assad's oral response to the Israeli peace proposal and Syria's
open support to Israel's pullout from south Lebanon added some hope
for Clinton to help break the impasse on the Israeli-Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
During the summit, Barak is also likely to ask the Americans to
lobby the United Nations Security Council members to support its
south Lebanon withdrawal, as was required in U.N. Resolution 425,
and to support the deployment of U.N. peacekeeping forces in south
Lebanon after the Israeli pullout.
</P>
<P>
Another focus of the Clinton-Barak summit will be the efforts to
accelerate and intensify the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations which
are going on at the Bolling Air Base outside Washington.
</P>
<P>
The talks are designed to reach a framework agreement between
the two sides as soon as possible and conclude an agreement on all
permanent-status issues by September 13, 2000, as asked by the
Sharm el Sheikh peace deal signed last September.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, seeing no progress made so
far, complained Friday that the peace talks with Israel are "a
waste of time" and called for a deeper U.S. intervention to press
Israel to make compromise.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is eager to move the peace process forward in the
remainder of his term of office, will probably ask from Barak a
clear commitment to the attainment of framework deal in May, the
new date set by Barak after the initial deadline of February was
given up.
</P>
<P>
The summit is also meant to boost strategic relations between
Israel and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Meets with Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak met
Sunday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, a frequent visitor
for consultation and coordination on the Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Details of the meeting were not immediately available. But the
two leaders are expected to deal with the latest developments of
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, and coordinate their stances
on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Zodi Qadera, Palestinian ambassador in Cairo, was quoted as
saying on Saturday by Egypt's Middle East News Agency that Arafat
would keep Mubarak posted on the negotiations between the
Palestinians and Israel in Washington, the United States.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel are negotiating for a final
settlement of the thorniest issues, including Jerusalem, refugees,
Jewish settlements, final borders and water, in their final-status
talks. The two sides have agreed to sign a final peace agreement on
these issues in September.
</P>
<P>
Qadera said that Mubarak is also expected to brief Arafat on his
talks with U.S. President Bill Clinton during his U.S. trip at the
end of March. The Mubarak-Clinton meeting covered the Palestinian-
Israeli negotiations, alongside a number of regional and bilateral
issues.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cairo earlier in the day and he will be
followed by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak who announced Sunday
that he is to meet Mubarak here Monday before his visit to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli leader is also expected to have consultations with
the Egyptian leader on new developments of the mideast peace
process.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Revenue Earnings Well Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Revenue collection during the first
nine months of the current fiscal year (1999-2000) remained almost
static at last year's level, registering a mere 0.41 percent rise
over the previous period, The Financial Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary assessment, the collection of tax
revenue during the July-March period of the current fiscal
amounted to 102.55 billion taka (2 billion U.S. dollars), 14.03
percent less than the planned target.
</P>
<P>
Revenue collection performed conspicuously poorly last month,
demonstrating the highest-ever shortfall in a single month since
the country's independence.
</P>
<P>
In March, revenue collection amounted to 12.65 billion taka (
243 million dollars), 26.61 percent less than the target fixed for
the month.
</P>
<P>
If the revenue collection does not gain immediate momentum and
the present downtrend continues, the revenue shortfall in the
current fiscal year may hit 30 billion taka (577 million dollars),
experts said.
</P>
<P>
For the downfall in revenue collection, experts blamed
declining industrial performance, port congestion, dropping
imports with high import duties, large-scale smuggling of foreign
goods and fixation of too ambitious targets.
</P>
<P>
They also identified the introduction of the mandatory Pre-
shipment Inspection as one of the major reasons behind the heavy
shortfall in revenue collection.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Mark Meyers, one of Australia's
leading cross-country riders, died Sunday, when his horse fell on
him during a competition, according to reports from Brisbane,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Meyers' death at the Fig Tree Pocket cross country event in
southern Queensland state comes just weeks before an interim
safety report on eventing is due to be handed to the sport's
international governing body.
</P>
<P>
Myers, a father of two and in his early 30s, died before
reaching hospital, a police spokeswoman said. His horse was not
injured.
</P>
<P>
Myers was the first competitor on the course Sunday morning
when his horse hesitated at a bounce jump - where a horse lands
and then has to jump over a second fence immediately without
taking a stride.
</P>
<P>
An Equestrian Federation of Australia spokeswoman said the
horse jumped long over the first obstacle, hitting the second part
of the jump and then somersaulted on top of Myers.
</P>
<P>
Olympic equestrian team manager Gareth McKeen said despite the
dangerous nature of the event, fatalities were unacceptable and
the incident would be fully investigated.
</P>
<P>
McKeen said that Myers had ridden the Fig Tree course several
times and the horse he was riding Sunday was experienced.

<TEXT>

<P>
RIYADH, April 9 ( Xinhua ) -- Foreign ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council has strongly deplored the "unjustified"
campaign by the Amnesty International (AI) against Saudi Arabia
due to its application of the Islamic Sharia laws.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of GCC ministerial meeting
Saturday, the Gulf foreign ministers urged the AI and other non-
governmental organizations to be committed to accuracy, objectivity
and respect for beliefs, cultures, and civilizations of other
nations and their privacies which are deemed as an important base
of human rights, local press reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held following the conclusion of the 74th
session of the ministerial council in Jiddah Saturday night, Saudi
Foreign Minister Prince Saud Al-Faisal stressed that the AI's
campaign is unfair, biased and is not based on facts, saying that "
we do not care about such campaign so long as the Saudi citizens
know that their rights are maintained and human rights in our
country are respected."
</P>
<P>
He added that "Saudi Arabia is applying Islamic laws (Sharia)
that are adopted and believed by 1.2 billion muslims worldwide,"
therefore this campaign is not objective, untrue and groundless.

<HEADLINE> IT Industry Tops Shenzhen's Development Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Shenzhen's resolve to speed up
development of IT industry is illustrated by the city's recent
decision to invest one billion yuan (120 million US dollars) and
build a park for net companies.
</P>
<P>
By the year of 2005, IT industry will become Shenzhen's most
dynamic economic powerhouse and the city's IT industrial output
value will exceed 200 billion yuan (24 billion US dollars), said
an official with Shenzhen Information Construction Committee.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, has witnessed a fast
expansion in its IT industry. The city has 250,000 net subscribers,
and the per-capita spending on information is more than 380 yuan a
year.
</P>
<P>
The official predicted that in next five years, more than 50
percent of the companies in the city will choose e-commerce as
their major way of trading and approximately 30 percent of a
company's total trade volume will be done online.
</P>
<P>
There have been over 100 foreign trade firms that applied to
electronic data interchange (EDI) since the country's first EDI
customs clearance was put into operation in Shenzhen in 1997. And
more than 80,000 local enterprises, or 50 percent of the tax-
paying enterprises, are using EDI when reporting taxes to Shenzhen
Local Taxation Bureau.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, the city has been working on
regulations regarding management of e-commerce. It will also set
up a center to certify security in e-business, and to construct a
city-wide comprehensive information exchange platform for e-
commerce clients.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the development prospects for IT in Shenzhen city
has drawn a huge sum of investment from overseas. For instance,
overseas companies including the IDG of the United States
participated in Shenzhen's drive to build a park for net companies,
dubbed "Shenzhen Digital Harbor".

<HEADLINE> Iran Releases 500 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Sunday unilaterally released
500 Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) left over from the 1980-88 bloody
war between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi POWs were set free through the Khosravi border point
in Iran's Kermanshah province at a ceremony attended by officials
from the two countries and representative of the International
Committee of the Red Cross, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the first stage of Iran's unilateral release of 2,000
Iraqi POWs to be followed by other stages, Kameran Bakhtiari, an
Iranian official at the border point, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced on Wednesday to unilaterally release 2,000 Iraqi
POWs in an aim to solve the POW issue with Iraq, one of the major
hurdles on the way of normalization of Tehran-Baghdad ties.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials expressed hope that Baghdad would respond to
Tehran's "goodwill gesture" by helping to determine the fate of
Iranian POWs and those missing in action.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein recently accused Iran of
torturing and murdering Iraqi POWs by using methods "worse than the
Nazis during the World War II." Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman
Hamid Reza Asefi soon refuted the accusation.
</P>
<P>
Iran said that it had released 55,438 Iraqi POWs since 1981 on
103 occasions while Iraq freed 39,417 Iranian POWs in the same
period on 70 occasions.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed last month that Iraq still holds 2,800 Iranians
according to available documents, but Iraq claimed that it has
repatriated all Iranian POWs and the 64 Iranians still being held
are "criminals" who were arrested after the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that around 13,000 Iraqi POWs remain imprisoned in
Iran. But Iran refused to confirm how many Iraqi POWs are still
held in the country.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Transportation Minister Yitzhak Mordechai has asked
Prime Minister Ehud Barak to take over his duties, as the police
investigation is preventing him from doing his job.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Barak is expected to inform the cabinet Sunday
at its weekly meeting that he is assuming the Mordechai's
responsibilities for up to three months.
</P>
<P>
Police are expected in the coming days to recommend to the State
Attorney's Office that Mordechai be indicted on charges of sexually
assaulting a 23-year-old ministry worker.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The army is changing its redeployment plans in the event of a
unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon following instructions
from Barak.
</P>
<P>
Israeli outposts located several dozen meters into the Lebanese
side of the international border will also be evacuated, according
to the changes in the plan known as Operation Morning Twilight.
</P>
<P>
The Israel Defense Forces originally recommended more than a
month ago that some outposts be maintained, including three of them
inside Lebanon within a kilometer of the border.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- In a surprise announcement, U.S. officials said Barak will
meet on Tuesday with U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White
House. The two leaders will discuss the future of the peace process
in the aftermath of the impasse in negotiations with Syria and in
light of Israel's plan to withdraw its troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office relayed that the impetus for the White House
meeting came a few days ago from the American government, and those
preparations were conducted secretly until a date was set last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks with Syria appear to be heading toward resumption
after the U.S. said Saturday that it had received answers from
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad to Israeli peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The State Attorney's Office has received up to 10 crates of
material from the police on the investigation of President Ezer
Weizman and cannot predict when it will decide whether the
allegations against the president warrant indictment, State
Attorney Edna Arbel told Channel 1 in a weekend interview.
</P>
<P>
Arbel also indicated she believes that, should the decision be
to close the file, Attorney-General Elyakim Rubinstein will address
the ethical aspects of the case.
</P>
<P>
Arbel stressed that responsibility for closing the file or
pressing charges does not belong to the police, but to the State
Attorney's Office ant the attorney-general.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Veterans Call For Land Before Parliament Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Despite the amendment of the Zimbabwe Constitution to empower
the government to compulsorily acquire land for resettlement
without paying compensation, Leader of the Zimbabwe National
Liberation War Veterans Association Chenjerai Hunzvi Saturday
said while they welcomed the passing of the Amendment Bill as a
"historic event" they would, however, not evacuate from the farms.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans have occupied over 700 white commercial farms
 throughout the country in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
Hunzvi said, "We are here to stay. It is our land and why
should we move out?"
</P>
<P>
He said, "This is the first Bill passed in Parliament that is
in favor of the indigenous people. We were robbed of our land in
the early part of the just ended century. It has been very
difficult for the government to acquire land and this amendment
will change that for the better."
</P>
<P>
He said the government should proceed with haste to
redistribute the acquired farms "before the forthcoming
Parliamentary elections in May."
</P>
<P>
"After the elections it will be difficult, as you are aware
politicians always want to sit on things. Land should be given
to the indigenous people now," he told The Sunday Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed assertions by the international community and some
sections of the Press that the land occupation by the
ex-combatants would destroy the economy.
</P>
<P>
"I was confronted by a British journalist who said if the
whites go then the economy will collapse. That is not true.
They should not underestimate the ability of the people to
produce for the country. There is this serious misconception
that it is whites who are producing in the farms, but that is
obviously not true. We are in the process of sourcing the
resources to support redistribution and development of these
farms," he said.

<HEADLINE> Georgia Holds Presidential Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Georgian voters went to the polls
Sunday to elect a president that will rule the former Soviet
republic in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Eduard Shevardnadze, 72, is the runaway favorite
among the five candidates contesting in the race. He could snatch
as much as 70 percent of the votes, the Russian media reported,
citing recent polls.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, who took office in November 1995, promised
voters to fight corruption, join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and phase out Russian military bases on its
territory. He also seeks help from the International Monetary Fund
to alleviate the country's poverty.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze's main rival is Dzhumber Patisashvili, the former
First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party Central Committee,
who is expected to get around 20 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Patisashvili was also a candidate in the previous race in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Georgia holds presidential elections once every five years.
Preliminary results of Sunday's balloting will be available on
Monday morning.

<HEADLINE> Bucks Edges Nets in Saturday's NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Ray Allen collected 21 points
and Sam Cassell, Glenn Robinson and Tim Thomas scored 20 apiece as
the Milwaukee Bucks edged the New Jersey Nets 109-101 in the
eighth and final Eastern Conference playoff spot in Milwaukee on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Bucks got their third win in four games and moved within
two games of the idle Orlando Magic for the eighth spot with six
games remaining.
</P>
<P>
Johnny Newman scored 21 points and Keith Van Horn added 19 for
New Jersey, which lost its sixth straight. The Nets were
eliminated from playoff contention on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, Shaquille O'Neal sat out with a sprained left
ankle and his Lakers teammates looked awful in a 98-80 loss to the
San Antonio Spurs that snapped their 14-game home winning streak.
</P>
<P>
The superstar center has powered the Lakers (64-13) to the best
record in the league this season, leading the NBA in scoring and
field-goal percentage while running second in rebounding and third
in blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
But with O'Neal on the bench in a blue suit, the Lakers had no
way of countering the Spurs' Twin Towers. Tim Duncan had 26 points,
16 rebounds and four blocks and David Robinson added 15 points and
eight boards.
</P>
<P>
In Denver, James Posey scored nine of his 19 points in the
pivotal third quarter as the Nuggets defeated the slumping Seattle
SuperSonics 105-97.
</P>
<P>
The Sonics have lost six of their last eight to drop 1 1/2
games behind the seventh-place Sacramento Kings with six games
left. The eighth seed in the Western Conference faces the Lakers
in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
In Cleveland, rookie guard Andre Miller held All-Star Grant
Hill to 11 points on 4-of-18 shooting and the Cavaliers pulled
away in the second half for a 117-98 victory over the run-down
Detroit Pistons.
</P>
<P>
Jerome Williams totalled 19 points to lead the Pistons, who
were playing their fifth game in seven days. Detroit shot just 36
percent (32-of-89) from the field.
</P>
<P>
In Portland, after falling behind by double digits to the lowly
Vancouver Grizzlies, the Trail Blazers put their swarming defence
to work in the third quarter en route to a 98-85 win.
</P>
<P>
Rasheed Wallace and Steve Smith collected 10 points apiece in
the third quarter, when the Blazers outscored Vancouver 29-9.
Smith finished with 27 points and Wallace added 21.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Chris Whitney scored 19 points to lead seven
players in double figures as the Wizards never trailed in a 108-98
victory over the Atlanta Hawks.
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, Toronto Raptors defeated Chicago Bulls 98-79
victory while the Dallas Mavericks eliminated the Los Angeles
Clippers 98-96 in Dallas.

<HEADLINE> O'Neal Watches As Spurs Beat Lakers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 8 (Xinhua) -- With Shaquille O'Neal
sidelined by a sprained left ankle, Tim Duncan and David Robinson
Saturday night dominated the middle as the defending NBA champion
San Antonio Spurs beat Los Angeles 98-80, snapping the Lakers' 11-
game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Lakers Coach Phil Jackson had said he wants
the Lakers to win a decisive victory over the Spurs in tonight's
match.
</P>
<P>
"This is a team we not only want to beat, we want to beat
soundly. We want to let them know that it's going to be very
difficult to play us in the playoffs." Jackson said Friday
following Lakers practice.
</P>
<P>
Records of the two best NBA teams so far are 1-1 Before tonight
game.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers (64-12) have won 11 straight games, and 30 of 31
since dropping a 105-81 decision at San Antonio on February 1. The
Lakers are now most powerful for any team in NBA, including the
defending champion Spurs.
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the keys to beating the Spurs tonight are keeping
Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal out of early foul trouble (he
picked up two quick fouls in the last meeting) and not allowing
Spurs point guard Avery Johnson to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
But O'Neal was forced to sit out tonight game because of a
sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer with a 29.5-point average,
didn't practice Friday, and was sent to the Kerlan-Jobe
Orthopaedic Clinic in nearby Inglewood for X-rays, which were
negative. He was listed as day-to-day. He apparently sprained his
ankle in the first half of Wednesday night's 111-104 victory at
Golden State, a game in which he had 49 points and 13 rebounds,
team spokesman John Black said.
</P>
<P>
Duncan had 26 points, 16 rebounds and four blocked shots, and
Robinson added 15 points and eight rebounds as the Spurs snapped a
three-game losing streak and beat the Lakers for the seventh time
in eight games, including a sweep of the Western Conference finals
last May.
</P>
<P>
Kobe Bryant led the Lakers with 26 points, eight rebounds and
five assists, and Glen Rice added 17 points.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers have already clinched the NBA's best record and
homecourt advantage throughout the playoffs, so the game meant
little to them.

KUWAIT, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Qatar came from behind to draw with
Jordan 2-2 in Doha, Qatar on Sunday and advanced to the finals of
the Asian Cup soccer tournament to be held in Lebanon later this
year.
</P>
<P>
Qatar needed only a draw from their last match in Group Four to
qualify for the 12-team final rounds while Jordan were in a must-
win situation. When the teams trooped out for the breather with
Jordan leading 2-0, it seemed it was curtains for Qatar.
</P>
<P>
But the host team staged a brilliant rally to come back into
the match with two quick goals and put paid to Jordan's hopes of
making it to the finals in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Mohammed Abu put Jordan in the lead in the 23rd minute
and before the interval substitute Sufian Abdullah Davoud made it
2-0. Qatar pulled one back in the 66th minute through Fahad Al
Kuwari and his teammate Mohammed Salem Al Enazi netted the vital
equaliser later.

<HEADLINE> New Standards Expected for Development of HDTVs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to issue new
standards to stimulate and regulate the development of its high-
definition television (HDTV) market by the end of this year,
according to today's "China Daily Business Weekly".
</P>
<P>
Du Baichuan, vice-president of the Academy of Broadcasting
Science under the State Administration of Radio, Film and TV (
SARFT), was quoted as saying that the development of HDTV will
result in another revolution within the household appliances
industry.
</P>
<P>
As a country with 350 million TV-set owners, the market
potential is beyond imagination, he added.
</P>
<P>
Most TV sets in use today are standard definition TVs (SDTVs).
SDTVs and HDTVs have different levels of resolution, as high as 1,
125 scanning lines (interlaced) for HDTVs, and to as low as 525 (
interlaced) or progressive) scanning lines for SDTVs.
</P>
<P>
TV stations now transmit using analog signals, and reception is
far inferior to that of HDTVS.
</P>
<P>
But business insiders regard HDTVs as another development
opportunity. Big names such as Konka, TCL and Peony are working
together with SARFT to speed the development of industry standards.
</P>
<P>
Given the huge population base and low technological levels in
China, the complete replacement of SDTVs with HDTVs is at least 10
years away, said Du.

<HEADLINE> China's Western Region Needs More Steel Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China's steel makers are expected
to get a big boost from the country's all-out efforts to develop
its western region.
</P>
<P>
The central government will undertake large-scale
infrastructure construction in the western region beginning this
year to fuel its development, which will significantly stimulate
demand for steel products, according to a source with the State
Administration of Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
This year's demand is expected to exceed 20 million tons in the
western region, an increase of 20 percent from that of 1999,
today's "China Daily Business Weekly" quoted the source as saying.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaoqi, director of development and planning department
under the administration, noted that by the end of the country's
Tenth Five-Year Plan (2001-2005), the government is expected to
invest more than 300 billion yuan (36.14 billion U.S. dollars) in
railway and road projects in the western region.
</P>
<P>
China's western region covers 10 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions including Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia,
Xinjiang, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan, Guizhou and Tibet. The
region occupies more than half of the country's total territory.
</P>
<P>
Construction of a 4,200-km natural gas pipeline from the
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the northwest to the east
China's Shanghai Municipality is expected to begin next year and
will require more than 2 million tons of steel products. There is
also a great need of steel products for housing development in the
western region, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang predicted that the demand for steel products in the region
will rise to 25 million tons in 2005, about 16.5 percent of the
country's total.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, many foreign steel producers are also considering the
large potential market in the region, the official added.

<HEADLINE> China Setting up First Sapling Breeding Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China is speeding up the building of
its first tree breeding base in the Yellow River Delta area, east
China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 58.1 million yuan (about 7 million U.
S. dollars), the project is expected to turn out more than 50
million saplings annually and generate over 16.7 million yuan (2
million U.S. dollars) in profits.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, an improved sapling breeding base covering 33.3
hectares and a sapling cultivation greenhouse with a floor space
of 13,000 sq m have been completed. The project has also completed
the grafting of 900,000 winter date trees and 500,000 black walnut
trees.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the saplings bred in the base are more
suitable to north China region, especially on saline-alkali soil
and muddy coastal land.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River Delta is one of the country's three biggest
river deltas, and boasts plentiful petroleum and gas resources.

<HEADLINE> Tamil Rebels Sink Sri Lankan Navy Gunboats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Tamil rebels have sunk two
government troops' gunboats off northern coast of Sri Lanka,
according to a statement of the rebels Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sea battle took place Friday night near the government
troops-held Elephant Pass, which links the mainland and the Jaffna
Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The two Dvora-class gunboats were hit by the artillery fire of
the rebels. "Following the incident a sea battle raged and
continued for several hours," the rebels in the statement from its
London office said.
</P>
<P>
Eleven sailors had been rescued while another 20 are reportedly
missing.
</P>
<P>
Two craft were lost in a Tamil rebel attack and a rescue
operation had been launched to look for survivors. Most of the
crew from the gunboats were rescued, a statement from The Defense
Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The rebels launched a major offensive 12 days ago to take the
Elephant pass, a vital road bridge, in their fighting to recapture
the Jaffna Peninsula which they lost to government troops in May
1996.
</P>
<P>
The sea battle is raging amid efforts by Norway to bring the Sri
Lankan government and the Tamil rebels to the negotiating table to
end the war which has been launched by the Tamil rebels since 1983
for a separate homeland in the north and east of the country.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Sustainable Tourism, Priority for Thailand  by Yuan Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Thai tourism industry had a
triumphant year in 1999 with total visitor arrivals reaching 8.58
million, an increase of 10.5 percent over 1998. In spite of this,
the country's top tourism manager is thinking about how to keep
the industry from growing too fast to make the development a
sustainable one.
</P>
<P>
"It is not our priority to be more developed in tourism because
we have to maintain a balance between tourism growth and our
infrastructure development," Pradech Phyakvichien, governor of the
Tourism Authority of Thailand, said recently in an interview with
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"Our top challenge is to maintain good quality (of tourism) and
our ultimate mission is to try to become a world-class destination
up to the international standard while maintaining our national
identity," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tourism sector is now the country's second biggest foreign
exchange earner after the export of computers and their parts. And
approximately 2 million out of 61 million Thais are employed
directly or indirectly in travel and tourism-related jobs. Tourism
affects the lives of many Thais and has become an integral part of
Thai life.
</P>
<P>
Pradech attributed the success of the industry to three
prominent factors. First, effective integrated marketing and
promotional campaigns have built a powerful "Thailand" brand in
the international markets.
</P>
<P>
Second, the country is strategically located at the crossroads
of Southeast Asia, and Bangkok's geographic location makes it a
natural hub for direct flights from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Third, and the most important, ever-smiling and hospitable
Thais have earned the country a fame of the "Land of Smiles."
</P>
<P>
So for tourism is continuing to be a viable and sustainable
means of livelihood for the Thai people, Pradech said, adding that
people involved in the industry must preserve and promote these
advantages for long-term sustainability and attain the country's
world-class status as a tourism destination while retaining the
distinct Thai cultural identity.
</P>
<P>
After the second Bangkok international airport is operated in
the year 2004, the city will be able to accommodate as many as 30
million passengers annually, providing a solid basis for a larger
volume of tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Besides the public sector's efforts to develop the
infrastructure, sustainable tourism calls for a new form of public-
private partnership, Pradech said.
</P>
<P>
TAT and the private sector have been enjoying a good
partnership in terms of marketing and promotion. For example, they
cooperated in joint advertising world-wide. In principle, TAT pays
for 70 percent of advertising costs and the private sector does
the rest.
</P>
<P>
But in the last few years, as the industry is growing fast, a
lot of problems also emerged, such as protection of destinations,
preservation of Thai cultural heritage and environmental
protection. Most of the problems are being caused by rampant,
uncontrolled development by the private sector.
</P>
<P>
"We need a new form of partnership, one that will allow the
private sector to start playing a greater role in policing itself,
" the governor said. "The private sector, especially in local
provincial areas, needs to start enforcing its own standards."
</P>
<P>
"If it does not, the entire industry will suffer," he said.
</P>
<P>
Pradech also attached great importance to human resources
development, citing it a basis for sustainable development of
tourism.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage education institution to provide more travel and
tourism management courses, and right now there are more than 100
universities and colleges offering tourism programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Increased local involvement is also an important point to be
strengthened to sustain the growth momentum of tourism, Pradech
said.
</P>
<P>
"It is only when tourism development efforts have been
decentralized with increased local involvement and responsibility,
especially at the 'tamboo' or district level that tourism
development becomes continuous and sustainable," Pradech said.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether a 7 percent growth of tourist arrivals this
year is too conservative, the governor said, "we would not expand
very fast unless we can enlarge our tourism base."
</P>
<P>
"We will never trade off our national culture for tourism," he
said.

<P>
TOKYO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Japanese citizens held a
conference in Osaka Saturday, refuting the recent denial of
Nanjing Massacre by a Japanese right-wing group, according to a
local media report.
</P>
<P>
The Japan Times report said the gathering was held at Osaka
International Peace Center (Peace Osaka), the same venue of the
January symposium of the right-wing group which claimed that the
1937 Nanjing Massacre "is a lie."
</P>
<P>
The conference, entitled "Correcting Peace Osaka's Questioning
of the Nanjing Massacre", was sponsored by a local citizens group
and attended by Japanese activists and scholars to refute the
allegations made by some 200 members of the right-wing group at
the earlier symposium.
</P>
<P>
"Who lied? The right-wing group that held the symposium", said
Keynote speaker Cheng Shanzhu, director of the Memorial Hall of
the Victims in the Nanjing Massacre by Japanese Aggressor Troops.
</P>
<P>
Cheng also said the prefectural and municipal governments of
Osaka, western Japan, made a grave mistake by allowing the right-
wing group to hold symposium at a center dedicated to peace.

XI'AN, April 9 (Xinhua) -- China has completed a feasibility
study on transmitting electric power from resources-rich western
China to energy-short coastal areas in the eastern part of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The project will involve a total investment of 32.9 billion
yuan (about 4 billion US dollars), Zheng Sixin, the official in

<HEADLINE> Trade Between China, India Picking up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Trade between China and India
reached a record high in 1999, but still has plenty of room for
growth, trade officials and analysts agreed last week.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the General Administration of Customs GAC)
reveal that the two-way trade volume between China and India hit a
record high of 1.99 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, up 3.4 percent
from a year earlier and 71.6 percent higher than 1995.
</P>
<P>
Today's "China Daily" quoted an official from the Chinese
Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation (CAITEC)
as saying that an improvement of the Sino-Indian political
relationship and the continual strong growth of the two economies
were two main factors cited for the rising trade between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
China and India both escaped direct effects of the Asian
financial turmoil of 1997 and 1998. Expansive imports and exports
helped fuel growth of the bilateral trade, said Xu Changwen,
director of Asian and African Affairs Department under the CAITEC.
</P>
<P>
Xu further noted that complementary Chinese and the Indian
economies form a basis for further boost bilateral economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two countries initiated bilateral trade back in 1951, a
year after the two countries established diplomatic relationship,
he recalled. By the end of 1999, Chinese businesses had signed 102
engineering contracting and labor service contracts with Indian
partners and had reported 138.4 million U.S. dollars in turnover.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China and India have conducted comprehensive
discussions concerning bilateral cooperation in a wide range of
sectors such as petrochemicals, energy, railways,
telecommunications, aviation and milk product manufacturing.

<HEADLINE> More Farmers in Zhejiang Bid Farewell to Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- More and more farmers in east
China's economically-developed Zhejiang Province are leaving the
farm and blazing new trails, spurred on by rising market economy.
</P>
<P>
The number of such farmers exceeded 10 million in Zhejiang last
year, according to the provincial statistics bureau. They are
mainly engaged in industries, building construction,
communications and transportation, and wholesale and retail
businesses.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the number of rural workers in the
province stood at 20.9 million, and only 8.9 million of them
engaged in farming.
</P>
<P>
Rural enterprises have drawn some 36 percent of these former
farmers in recent years.
</P>
<P>
High income in the tertiary sector has attracted more than 5
million rural laborers, or over one-fifth of the province's total.
In 1999, per-capita income in the communications and
transportation and the catering sectors surpassed 10,000 yuan (
about 1,200 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a growing number of rural laborers have gone to
other cities and towns in the province or elsewhere in China to do

JAKARTA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government is
preparing a draft on the setting up of offices for border
cooperation with neighboring countries to serve the interest of
people living in border regions.
</P>
<P>
"It is very urgent to set up border cooperation offices in
provinces bordering with another country, like Aceh, Riau, East
Kalimantan, East Nusa Tenggara, North Sulawesi and Irian Jaya (
Papua)," State Minister for Administrative Reform Freddy Numberi
said in Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya.

Numberi said that with such border cooperation offices the
regions concerned are authorized to arrange cooperation in border
regions.
</P>
<P>
"This kind of cooperation should no longer be dictated by
Jakarta, while the regions have only to follow instructions ...
The regions should be empowered to take care of its own affairs
with a neighboring country," the minister was quoted by the Antara

<HEADLINE> Myanmar's Customs Duties Income Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar received 795 million U.S.
dollars from customs duties in 1999, a 29.98 percent drop from
1998 when it got 1.1355 billion dollars, according to the latest
figures released by the country's Central Statistical Organization.
</P>
<P>
The main source of Myanmar's customs duties income comes from
import through normal trade and border trade, respectively
accounting for 86.8 percent and 12.57 percent.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, the country's customs duties income from import
through normal trade amounted to 690 million dollars, while that
through border trade was 100 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Myanmar made relatively large adjustments to
the rate of customs duties. One of these is that to promote the
development of its agriculture, the Myanmar government exempted
import duties on agricultural implements, pesticide, improved
varieties and fertilizer.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Raps U.S. Peacekeepers for Obstructing Return of Kosovan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia on Saturday lashed out
at U.S. peacekeepers for obstructing a group of Serb refugees from
returning to the southwestern Yugoslav province of Kosovo, saying
such a move is "a gross violation of human rights and the basic
principles of humanitarian law."
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the official Tanjug news agency, Bratislava
Morina, Yugoslav minister for refugees and humanitarian aid, said:
"Instead of guaranteeing peace and security to all citizens in
Kosovo, KFOR directly connives at ethnic cleansing of Serbs and
other non-Albanians."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. contingent of the NATO-led Kosovo peacekeeping force (
KFOR) on Friday blocked a convoy of more than 200 Serb refugees on
their way back to Kosovo's Strpce area from Yugoslavia's Serbian
Republic, Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said the U.S. peacekeepers made their passage a
condition that Serbs in Sevce village of Strpce hand back a young
Serb villager who was formerly arrested for alleged "war crimes"
but later "rescued" by the angry local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The offer was rejected by the Serb refugees who were afterwards
escorted back to the town of Vranje in southern Serbia at the
gunpoint of the U.S. soldiers, the report added.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the U.S. peacekeepers clashed with Serbs in Sevce
when they arrested the Serb youth for alleged war crimes during a
search of weapons in the village. The Serb youth escaped during
the clash, in which 16 Serbs and 16 U.S. soldiers were injured.
</P>
<P>
To pressure for the handover of the escapee, the U.S.
contingent has suspended all civil services, including supplying
emergency medical aid and escorting convoys of Serb villagers, to
the Serb part of Sevce.

<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, April 8 (Xinhua) -- European Union finance ministers on
Friday held two days of informal talks in Lisbon to discuss the
economic situation in the euro zone and European tax package aimed
at combating tax evasion and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
All the 15 members of the European Union agreed to accelerate
the reforms of economy and mechanism in order to promote the
steady growth of European economy, Portuguese Minister of Finance
and Economy Joaquim Pina Moura said in the press conference after
the talks.
</P>
<P>
Moura also said that the economic situation of the euro zone is
stable and that he is optimistic about the prospects of EU economy
in 2000 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
The tax reform was the most sensitive and difficult question in
the talks. The EU has been trying since 1997 to achieve a tax
package aimed at preventing tax evasion by citizens who place
their savings in other member nations, but the negotiations have
made little progress because of British objection. In Friday's
meeting, the EU was still divided on the question, while Briton's
stand seemed to be flexible.

<HEADLINE> Bolivian Disturbance Worsens Amid Spread of Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The disturbance in Bolivia worsened
Saturday while the chaos in the central city of Cochabamba spread
elsewhere, with about 100 policemen in the capital of La Paz
setting off a mutiny, according to reports from La Paz.
</P>
<P>
The policemen occupied the headquarters of the Special Security
Group, which is just one block away from the Palace of Government,
said Information Minister Ronald MacLean on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The uprising occurred when the officers refused an order to
arrest one female sergeant and 15 wives of low-ranking police
officers who had been on a hunger strike since Monday to demand
150 percent wage hikes for their husbands.
</P>
<P>
Since the Bolivian government announced a state of emergency to
quell unrest early Saturday, at least two were killed and four
injured during clashes between protesters and policemen.
</P>
<P>
A peasant died and two injured when soldiers were trying to
reopen a road blocked by local peasants in La Huachaca, some 180
kilometers south of La Paz. Dozens of protesters were detained
following the emergency order.
</P>
<P>
The 90-day state of emergency, approved Friday evening by the
cabinet, gave President Hugo Banzer special powers to deploy
police and the military to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and policemen are patrolling main cities. The
government suspended the freedom of transit and assembling in an
effort to bring back social order.
</P>
<P>
The government's move came after a week of protests over rising
water rates, unemployment and other economic difficulties plaguing
the nation in the heart of South America.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were involved in the protests, which began
in Cochabamba, the country's third largest city, and quickly
spread elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
A 200-million-dollar water project in Cochabamba, which local
peasants feared could bring about excessive water rates, was the
fuse of the unrest.

-- A front-page story said that the state-owned enterprises and
enterprises with their large part of shares controlled by the
state in the Tibet Autonomous Region realized more than 460
million yuan (55.4 million U.S. dollars) in revenue in 1999, or 79.
9 percent of the autonomous region's total industrial and
commercial revenue.
</P>
<P>

Yuming, a 33-year-old medical doctor from the Medical College of
the Chinese Armed Police, who has made a breakthrough in the
research on the salt-sensitive high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
"Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- The "One China" principle is an issue of right and wrong,
and China will by no means compromise and give in on this matter
of principle, said Li Bingcai, deputy director of the China's
Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council and Taiwan Work Office
of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Taiwan's industrial and commercial fields openly
clamor for "Taiwan independence" and advocate the "Lee Teng-hui
Line", which preaches the break-up of the motherland. It has
exerted a bad influence, noted Li.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks on Saturday when answering reporters'
questions on the current economic relations across the Taiwan
Straits.
</P>
<P>
People across the Taiwan Straits feel the need to promote cross-
Straits relations and realize direct links in trade,
transportation and postal services between the two sides. China
expects that more Taiwan compatriots will come to the mainland for
investment and other types of economic cooperation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Ma Zu Culture Enhances Exchanges Across Taiwan Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The total number of Taiwan visitors
to Meizhou Island, Putian City, in east China's Fujian Province,
has exceeded one million since the island province opened to
Taiwan compatriots in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The visitors, old and young, have come mainly to worship Ma Zu.
</P>
<P>
Meizhou Island, located at the mouth of Meizhou Bay, on the
western shore of the Taiwan Straits, used to be a coastal defense
frontier before its opening up, and it was made a state-level
tourism zone in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The worshipping of Ma Zu culture originated in a story about a
man named Lin Mo, who lived more than 1,000 years ago and who
fought courageously against pirates and helped salvage victims of
maritime disasters.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 200 million Ma Zu culture followers in the
world, and they account for 75 percent of Taiwan's total
population.
</P>
<P>
A group of 220 Taiwan compatriots first visited the island in
1989 breaching, in defiance of the Taiwan authorities.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Meizhou Island organized the first Ma Zu Festival,
attracting some 100 Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
With the help of civil organizations on Taiwan, a gilded statue
of revered and highly esteemed Young Woman Ma Zu was shipped from
Meizhou to Taiwan for a parade, where it was welcomed by over 10
million people.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the Third Meizhou International Ma Zu
Culture Tourism Festival will be held from April 27 to May 6 on
Meizhou Island.
</P>
<P>
Fujian Province and its Putian City have invested a total of
600 million yuan (72.28 million US dollars) in construction of
temples, roads, ferry berths, program-controlled telephones, water
supply projects, hotels and recreation facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan for developing Meizhou, the island is
expected to be turned into a world-level research center for the
study of the Ma Zu culture, and a major base for cross-straits
scientific, cultural exchanges and economic, trade cooperation.

LA PAZ -- Bolivian government Sunday declared a state of
emergency amid continuing violent protests by peasants and
laborers in the central city of Cochabamba and the capital city of
La Paz.
</P>
<P>
A water law that could force peasants to pay for water they
currently use for free, and a pending waterworks project in
Cochabamba that promises to hike drinking water rates, are the
core reason for the current wave of unrest.
</P>
<P>
The 90-day state of emergency, approved Friday evening by the
cabinet, will give President Hugo Banzer special powers to deploy
police and the military to deal with the crisis. The move has to
be passed by the Congress, where the ruling party controls the
majority. (Bolivia-State of Emergency)

LONDON -- Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams Saturday warned that
Northern Ireland could face a return to violence unless the
fledgling power-sharing executive was restored.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Sinn Fein conference in Dublin, Adams said
British Prime Minister Tony Blair should order Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson to reinstate the institutions he
suspended in February amid deadlock over the issue of paramilitary
disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"There is the possibility that all of the good work of recent
years could be frittered away. Worse still there could be a slide
back to conflict," he told delegates gathered in Dublin for the
two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
Adams said the decision to suspend the devolved executive had
been the biggest mistake Labor had made since it came to power in
1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should not have made the decommissioning
of terrorist weapons a precondition for power sharing, and again
insisted that Sinn Fein -- the IRA's political wing -- could not
force the IRA to hand over its weapons. (NIreland-Sinn Fein)

<HEADLINE> Jackson Wants Lakers' Decisive Victory Over Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, April 8 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers Coach
Phil Jackson wants the Lakers to win a decisive victory over the
San Antonio Spurs, the NBA defending champion, in tonight's match.
</P>
<P>
"This is a team we not only want to beat, we want to beat
soundly. We want to let them know that it's going to be very
difficult to play us in the playoffs." Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
Records of the two best NBA teams so far this season are 1-1.
</P>
<P>
The Spurs (47-28), who counter Shaquille O'Neal with Tim Duncan
and David Robinson, have won six of their last seven meetings with
the Lakers, counting the last regular-season matchup last season
and the four-game sweep in the Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers (64-12) have won 11 straight games, and 30 of 31
since dropping a 105-81 decision at San Antonio on Feb. 1. The
Lakers, who have already clinched homecourt advantage throughout
the playoffs, are now most powerful for any team in NBA, including
the defending champion Spurs.
</P>
<P>
Jackson said the keys to beating the Spurs tonight are keeping
Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal out of early foul trouble (he
picked up two quick fouls in the last meeting) and not allowing
Spurs point guard Avery Johnson to penetrate.
</P>
<P>
But reports say O'Neal might be forced to sit out tonight game
because of a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer with a 29.5-point average,
didn't practice Friday, and was sent to the Kerlan-Jobe Orthopedic
Clinic in nearby Inglewood for X-rays, which were negative.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal was listed as day-to-day. He apparently sprained his
ankle in the first half of Wednesday night's 111-104 victory at
Golden State, a game in which he had 49 points and 13 rebounds,
team spokesman John Black said.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal, 28, seems a lock to win his first NBA Most Valuable
Player award in his eighth season. In addition to leading the
league in scoring, he leads in field goal percentage (.574), and
is second in rebounding behind Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo, who is
averaging 14.2 rebounds to O'Neal's 13.6.

season.
</P>
<P>
Bottom club Watford also look certain to go straight back down
after drawing 0-0 with Derby County at Vicarage Road where Stefan
Schnoor missed a second half penalty for the visitors.
</P>
<P>
Watford remain bottom on 20 points, a point behind Sheffield
Wednesday who trail Bradford City, on 26. Bradford are six points
behind Derby County.
</P>
<P>
Three clubs go down and Watford and Bradford, who suffered
their fifth successive defeat on Saturday, have only six games
left.
</P>
<P>
The focus was on the bottom of the table with none of the top
sides in action.
</P>
<P>
Wimbledon, who started the day in 16th place, failed to improve
their chances of staying up after losing 2-1 at Sunderland, the
only team in the top seven in action. It was Sunderland's third
successive win and Wimbledon's fourth successive defeat.
</P>
<P>
In the other match played Leicester City drew 1-1 with Everton
at Filbert Street.

<P>
PARIS, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Bruno Girard took a sweet revenge in
his grudge rematch against Byron Mitchell on Saturday by
outpointing the American fighter to win the WBA super middleweight
title.
</P>
<P>
After 12 rounds of explosive boxing, the Frenchman won a
unanimous decision, 116-113, 117-114, 116-113.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell, previously unbeaten in 21 fights, dominated the early
rounds. But 29-year-old Girard, who improves to 29-3-1, responded
with heavy punching and the Frenchman's team immediately began
celebrating after the final bell.
</P>
<P>
The boxers' December clash in Tunica, Mississippi, ended in a
controversial split-decision draw.

<HEADLINE> GCC FMs Urge Iraq to Comply With U.N. Resolution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC) states on Saturday called on Iraq to
positively react to United Nations Resolution 1284 and cooperate
with the U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission
(UNMOVIC).
</P>
<P>
In the final statement issued at the end of their one-day
meeting held in the western Saudi city of Jeddah, the ministers
expressed hope that Iraq would take concrete steps to fulfil its
committment to the international resolutions and the requirements
for peace and stability in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
On the territorial dispute between Iran and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), the GCC officials renewed its call on Iran to
cooperate with a GCC tripartite committee which is preparing a
mechanism for starting a direct dialog between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Both the UAE and Iran declared sovereignty over the three isles
of Abu Mussa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, in the strategic Strait
of Hormuz. The islands are now controlled by Tehran.
</P>
<P>
GCC sources said that the ministers also agreed to hold the
second GCC consultative summit in Oman on April 29. But they opted
not to refer it in the final statement, the sources told the Kuwait
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
GCC leaders held their first consultative summit in Jeddah in
May last year.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic alliance established
in 1981, comprises Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and
the UAE.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Strengthen Economic Activities Regulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is keen on creating
a sound regulatory framework to promote good, ethical business
practice and facilitate investment and trade in the country.
</P>
<P>
President Benjamin Mkapa has said that his government would
continue to play an important role in moderating the forces of
free market economies to protect the interests of the nation and
the individuals as well.
</P>
<P>
He told the industrialists at the Confederation of Tanzania
annual dinner here on Friday that it was an urgent challenge for
the government to create the regulatory framework.
</P>
<P>
"Unregulated free trade is worse than regulated controlled
trade," he said. "We have experienced these problems, such as in
crop marketing, supply of agricultural inputs, dumping of imported
goods and sub-standard goods."
</P>
<P>
He conceded that establishing a good regulatory framework was a
big challenge particularly during the period of economic
transition, but his government would endeavor to remove obstacles.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa promised the industrialists that he would personally
monitor their suggestions for such a framework to be implemented
in the next budget of 2000/2001.
</P>
<P>
The president said the government was working on their
recommendations to review the business licensing and land acts,
legal and regulatory bodies and would focus on the fiscal regime
to carry forward the tax structure review.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that too high taxes, or too many and complex
taxes make evasion an attractive and profitable option," he said,
adding that the government would deal with serious problem of
dumping and tax evasion in international trade.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Mkapa told another gathering of chief executives of
private enterprises that gains realized by Tanzania so far in the
economic field were not enough to make impact on poverty
reduction.
</P>
<P>
"The four percent annual economic growth, the attained lowest
inflation rate in over 30 years and the increased government
revenue are insufficient to have an impact on poverty," he said.
"The economy is growing at half the required rate."
</P>
<P>
He warned the ongoing economic reforms might be politically
unsustainable if the measures taken would not lead to a better
life for the people.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa complained that though the government revenue has been
increased, yet it accounted for only 90 percent of the amount
needed for the yearly recurrent expenditure of the government.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania collects less than 13 percent of its GDP as
government revenue, compared to 16 percent in Malawi and 25
percent in Kenya," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> Barak Would Fall If He Fails to Make Peace: Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
stepped up pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday
as their peace talks remained static, saying he would fall if he
lets people down in peace-making with Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Barak would fall as his right-wing predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu if he fails to make peace with Arabs, Arafat said, quoted
by Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Israeli people elected Barak last May on a ticket of making
peace, but he would "meet with the same fate" as Netanyahu, if he
continued to reject peace, Arafat told Egyptian reporters after
meeting with President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Barak defeated Netanyahu in the general election in May last
year, promising to realize peace with Israel's Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said: "I have a hunch that Barak lacks the strong motive
to implement what has been agreed with (the Palestinians), given
the fact that he is the leader of the hardliners and settlers."
Arafat paid a lightening visit to Egypt in the day.
</P>
<P>
He slammed the Israeli government's settlement policy, charging
that more than 7,000 housing units have been built for Jewish
settlers during the nine months since Barak came to power, far
exceeding those constructed during Netanyahu's three-year mandate.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader said the ongoing Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations in Washington have made no progress.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian and Israeli negotiators are working to meet a May
deadline to forge a formula for a final peace treaty to be
completed by September. Agreement is needed on thorny issues
including borders, the fate of Jewish settlements, the status of
Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.

KHARTOUM -- Sudan's privatization program will include all
state-run firms save those related to defense, security, education,
health care and potable water, according to Sudanese Finance
Minister Mohammed Kheir el-Zobair.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that some parties, which he did not
identify, offered to purchase the assets of the firms intended for
sale this year including SudanAir, General Mail and Communication
Corporation, Spinning and Weaving factories and Mechanic transport.
</P>
<P>
The remaining firms will be offered for entrepreneurs in 2001,
he added.
</P>
<P>
DOHA -- Population of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member
states is expected to surge to 40 millions by 2010 and the figure
of work force to about 21 million.
</P>
<P>
A GCC General Secretariat study said that the GCC countries
would be urged to replace foreign labor with native manpower,
specially as the ongoing privatization drive in these states will
reduce job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The study put the foreign labor in GCC members at about 8
million between l994 and l997, holding 93 percent of jobs in the
United Arab Emirates, 84 percent in Kuwait, 76 percent in Qatar, 68
percent in Oman, 65 percent in Bahrain, and 61 percent in Saudi
Atabia.

<P>
RABAT -- Moroccan government charted a 80.2 billion dirham (7.72
billion U.S. dollar) draft budget to be put to work as of next July
with gross domestic product (GDP) and inflation growth rates
projected at 3 percent and 2.3 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The draft budget anticipated a deficit decline by 36.2 percent
to 5.07 billion dirhams (490 million dollars) during the July-
December period from the same months last year.
</P>
<P>
The country's July 1999-June 2000 budget hit 140.9 billion
dirhams (13.6 billion dollars) with a deficit of 15.6 billion
dirhams (1.5 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Moroccan officials as saying that the draft
budget is to be approved during the next cabinet meeting later this
month and then submitted to the parliament in June.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordanian Tourism Minister Akel Biltaji expected
tourism revenues this year to be 100 million dollars higher than
last year to reach 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that entry visa at the various ports and
crossings in the country will be substituted by a credited stamp to
further streamline travel procedures.
</P>
<P>
He added that the tourism sector would be increasingly promoted
to make Jordan a competitive tourist destination with the help of
the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi POWs Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 500 Iraqi prisoners of war
(POWs) released by Iran on Sunday through the Khosravi border point
in Iran's Kermanshah province, have arrived in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It was a tearful reunion with the loved ones of the POWs, with
some having never seen their sons or daughters.
</P>
<P>
"I can not express anything, just like I were born again," one
of the POWs told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The POWs have been hailed as heros by the Iraqi government and
each POW will be given up to 300,000 Iraqi dinars (150 U.S.
dollars) for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The 500 Iraqi POWs, some of them having been held by Iran for as
many as 12 years, were put onto buses and taken home after a
medical check, including an AIDS test.
</P>
<P>
More Iraqi POWs will be set free by the Iranian side in the
coming days as a unilateral gesture to improve strained ties.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq fought an eight-year bloody war which ended in
1988, and the issue of POWs has been a major obstacle to the
normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
A ceremony, attended by officials from Iran and Iraq as well as
representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross,
was held in Iran Sunday to repatriate the Iraqi POWs.
</P>
<P>
Iran announced on Wednesday to unilaterally release 2,000 Iraqi
POWs in an effort to solve the POW issue with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iranian officials expressed hope that Baghdad would respond to
Tehran's "goodwill gesture" by helping to determine the fate of
Iranian POWs still held by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iran's move followed Iraq's call on Saturday for Iranian
cooperation on the issue of POWs and the release of all the
remaining Iraqi POWs still held in Iranian prisons.
</P>
<P>
Iraq claims that Iran still holds more than 13,000 Iraqi POWs,
while Tehran says more than 2,800 Iranian POWs are still held in
custody by the Iraqi authorities.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Iran started to exchange POWs in recent years to
improve relations.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, Iran unilaterally declared to set free 276
Iraqi POWs and in April 1998, the two sides exchanged more than 310
Iranian POWs and 5,500 Iraqi POWs.

<HEADLINE> (RPT With Correction) Eurocorps Chief Leaves For Kosovo to Command KFOR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the Eurocorps, Spanish
General Juan Ortuno, left the Eurocorps headquarters in Strasbourg
for Kosovo Sunday to take over the commanding post of the
multinational peacekeeping force in Kosovo (KFOR), according to
the Eurocorps.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant-General Ortuno, 59, has served as the commander and
chief of the General Staff of the Eurocorps since November last
year.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) decided in
January to let Eurocorps, which consists of troops from France,
Germany, Belgium, Spain and Luxembourg, to play a leading part in
the KFOR.
</P>
<P>
The KFOR has been under the command of NATO's Land Force in
Central Europe (Landcent) based in Heidelberg, Germany, and has
been commanded by German General Klaus Reinhardt since its entry
into Kosovo last June.

<HEADLINE> UK Nuclear Plant in Gas Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- A nuclear power station in Kent,
southeast England, was evacuated Sunday and an emergency was
declared after a leak of carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
Dungeness B, on the coast near Romney, was at the center of an
alert for several hours until the all-clear was given.
</P>
<P>
Officials said there was no risk of a nuclear leak and no
danger to the reactor because it had been switched off for
maintenance since November.
</P>
<P>
British Energy, which runs the plant, said the 281 people
working inside the building were told to go to emergency assembly
points when the alarm went off but returned to work later.
</P>
<P>
Emergency services crews were on standby at the scene.
</P>
<P>
British Energy spokesman Bob Fenton said the public have no
need to worry.
</P>
<P>
Fenton said the evacuation was a precautionary measure after a
monitoring system had detected the gas in a basement.
</P>
<P>
The level of carbon dioxide had dropped again since the first
alert, he said.
</P>
<P>
Dungeness B, built in 1983, has two reactors, which produce 1,
100 megawatts of electricity a day when in operation. In 1998,
there were two fuel leaks at the plant.

<HEADLINE> Sunday Without Cars Gaining in Popularity in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Italy's third car-free Sunday this
year dawned cloudy and with chill in the air but the inhabitants
of the 174 towns and cities taking part in the initiative came out
to stroll and jog, ride their bicycles, roller blade through the
throngs or take public transport, often free of charge.
</P>
<P>
In Rome and Milan, the Greens and activists of the Legambiente
environmental movement took to the streets to gather signatures
for an anti-traffic referendum proposal.
</P>
<P>
Also lining up to sign was Minister for the Environment Edo
Ronchi, whose idea it was to clear towns and cities of private
motor vehicle traffic at least once a month to turn the streets
over to the people.
</P>
<P>
Ronchi said the idea of convincing urban Italians to abandon
their beloved automobiles on Sundays came to him while reading "
the war bulletin on pollution, which claims the early death of 16,
000 people every year."
</P>
<P>
On the second car-free Sunday, March 5, benzene and carbon
monoxide in the atmosphere in these cities declined by between 50
percent and 90 percent and nitrogen dioxide was cut by 50 percent
to 80 percent as were suspended particles.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the third Sunday today, Ronchi said the day will
"see children invade the cities, the innocent victims of the
traffic pollution which suffocates Italian cities."
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the data for 1999, Ronchi said, "For benzene, we were
three times over the target of five micrograms per cubic meter and
the average readings in 18 sample cities was 14-15 micrograms per
cubic meter, over the present limit of 10."
</P>
<P>
The limit set for suspended particles, he said, is 40
micrograms per cubic meter but "we were at 50 and the goal is for
20 in ten years."
</P>
<P>
His automobile-free Sundays initiative, he argued, was
essential because the figures are a cause of worry for health and
"we have to send out a strong signal, reducing the accumulation
and limiting exposure."

<HEADLINE> S. African Chapter of African Renaissance Launched  </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 9 (Xinhua) --The South African Chapter of
African Renaissance (SACAR) was officially launched here on Sunday
after a three- day conference.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference, SACAR Chairman Thami Mazwai said
the launch was a step closer to the second phase of what the
political struggle, which toppled the apartheid government, had
hoped to achieve.
</P>
<P>
Mazwai said the first phase was political emancipation, which
had been achieved, while the second was poverty alleviation and
economic prosperity of black people.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Kapembe Nsingo, executive chairman of the African
Renaissance Institute, declared the official launch of the SACAR.
</P>
<P>
Nsingo, also executive director and founder of the African
Renaissance Institute in Gaborone, Botswana, welcomed SACAR's
affiliation to the African Renaissance Institute.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is the first African country to launch its own
Chapter of the continental African Renaissance Institute, which
was established in Botswana in October 1999.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that the African Renaissance movement would help
Africans regain their self-pride, self-reliance and confidence
that they can do things for themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to demand but we would do (work) and we are
not going to beg the IMF for money," Mazwai told delegates to a
thunderous applause.
</P>
<P>
"Africans throughout the whole continent must see themselves as
winners and not victims. They also must behave like winners.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to change that victim mindset," he added.
</P>
<P>
The conference was attended by more than 1,200 registered
delegates from various political parties.
</P>
<P>
During the past three days, speaker after speaker emphasized
the need for Africa to rid itself of the costly wars and diseases
that plague the continent.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Crisis Poses No Threat to SADC: S. African Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 9 (Xinhua) -- The crisis in Zimbabwe posed
no threat to the free trade pact of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But he said the South African government is worried about the
situation in Zimbabwe and in close contact with the authorities
there to see if anything can be done to assist.
</P>
<P>
Erwin, speaking on South African Broadcasting Corporation's
News maker program, said: "I don't think it (the crisis) poses a
problem to the basic SADC protocols or the SADC trade agreement."
</P>
<P>
"We've constituted the trade agreement in a manner that
countries can enter it as they are able to enter it; we're not
trying to force people to adjust at a pace they can't adjust at,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the Zimbabwean economy ran into major problems,
the pace at which the country entered into SADC protocols would
obviously have to change.
</P>
<P>
"But of course, we're worried about the Zimbabwean situation.
This is the second-largest economy (in the SADC community); it's
an important economy; it's the only other economy in SADC that has
a significant industrial base," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We're in constant contact with the Zimbabwean authorities and
the Zimbabwean government to see if there is anything we can do to
advise or concretely assist them," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- British director Sam Mendes's "
American Beauty" won the best film and five other top prizes at
Britain's most prestigious film awards ceremony Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The film's stars Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening were named
best actor and best actress at the ceremony staged by the British
Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA).
</P>
<P>
Veteran star Michael Caine, 67, was awarded a BAFTA fellowship
in recognition of his long, high-profile service to the British
film industry.
</P>
<P>
American Hollywood stars Dustin Hoffman and Faye Dunaway were
among the celebrities presenting the BAFTA awards.
</P>
<P>
Last month, "American Beauty" -- a dark tale of American
suburban angst -- won five Oscars, including best director for
Mendes.
</P>
<P>
The best British film award went to "East is East," a story
about an inter-racial marriage and the attempts of a Pakistani
immigrant to maintain his culture against the rival attractions of
mainstream life in Britain.

<HEADLINE> Peru To Have Runoff of Presidential Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Peru will hold a second round of
presidential election, according to the preliminary results of
parts of polling stations in the Andean country Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Moments after the voting ended, an exit poll by the independent
polling firm Apoyo gave 54-year-old Alejandro Toledo 48.5 percent
of the votes to President Fujimori's 42.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, other results show Fujimori won 46.6 percent against
45.2 percent for the U.S.-tained economist.
</P>
<P>
But the results did not take into account isolated rural areas
not accessible by road, where Fujimori is expected to have a
strong showing.
</P>
<P>
A candidate needs more than 50 percent of valid votes to avoid
a runoff election, which would be held in late May or early June.

<HEADLINE> PASOK Maintains Slight Lead in Greece's Parliamentary Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Greece's ruling Panhellenic
Socialist Movement (PASOK) is maintaining a slight, but steady,
lead over the main opposition New Democracy (ND) in Sunday's
parliamentary elections, with 78.8 percent of the votes counted
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released here around 1:55 a.m. Monday show
the PASOK leading with 43.6 percent, with the ND posting 43.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the PASOK is expected to win the
elections and can form a government with 156 or 157 deputies in
the 300-member parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) is in third place with 5.5
percent, followed by the Coalition of the Left and Progress (SYN)
with 3.2 percent. The Democratic Social Movement (DHKKI) with just
2.7 percent will not be represented in the parliament as it
harnessed less than 3 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
With more than 8.9 million Greeks flocking to the 18,959
polling stations to cast their ballots Sunday, the closest race in
recent Greek history, election officials have reported an
unprecedented turnout of more than 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
With a total of 26 political parties running in the elections,
the 10th since the restoration of democracy in Greece in 1974, the
PASOK and the ND are the two major players.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary elections in Greece are held officially every
four years, and the last elections took place in 1996 with the
ruling PASOK winning 162 seats in the 300-member parliament by
obtaining 41.49 percent of the votes, followed by the ND with 108
seats and 38.12 percent of the votes.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia to Continue Helping U.S. Hunt Down Laden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIYADH, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia will continue helping
the United States hunt down the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, who
was blamed by the U.S. for masterminding the 1998 bombings of two
U.S. embassies in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Laden was touched upon during the talks here on
Sunday between Saudi crown prince Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz and
visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary expressed his concern about Osama bin Laden, and
certainly the Saudis we know are concerned about terrorism
generally and Osama bin Laden in particular; after all, they
removed his citizenship," a U.S. official said on condition of
anonymity after the talks.
</P>
<P>
Capturing bin Laden is one of the highest U.S. priorities, and
the Saudis have been extremely cooperative with helping put
together a profile of bin Laden, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Saudi Arabia, which provides the base for U.S.
forces patrolling a southern no-fly zone over Iraq, also reaffirmed
its support for enforcing U.N. sanctions against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is visiting the Middle East and Gulf partly to maintain
continued support for U.S. policy on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
A report quoted U.S. officials as saying that the United States
had no plans to reduce its forces in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you, there's been no discussion whatsoever on any
level about any reduction of American forces here," U.S. ambassador
to Saudi Arabia, Wyche Fowler, said.
</P>
<P>
During the Abdullah-Cohen talks, they also discussed February's
Iranian parliamentary elections, in which reformist candidates won
most seats.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the United States lifted a ban against imports of
Iranian non-oil goods -- caviar, pistachios and carpets -- in a
move seen as a goodwill gesture.
</P>
<P>
Cohen has visited Qatar, Bahrain and Kuwait, and is to go on
from Saudi Arabia to the United Arab Emirates and Oman.
