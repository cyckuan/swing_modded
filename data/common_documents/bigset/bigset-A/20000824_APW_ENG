<HEADLINE> White Sox 8, Orioles 4  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Magglio Ordonez had three RBIs and the Chicago
White Sox made the most of nine walks and two Baltimore errors
Wednesday night to beat the Orioles 8-4 and stay seven games ahead
of Cleveland in the AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago reliever Sean Lowe came off the disabled list and made
his first start of the season, lasting just 4 1-3 innings and
giving up three of Baltimore's four solo homers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Orioles' power couldn't overcome their wild pitching and
sloppy fielding as the White Sox scored four unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   John Parrish (2-2), who beat Chicago six days ago at Camden
Yards despite walking eight, still couldn't find the plate
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   He walked five and committed a throwing error, giving up five
runs in 1 2-3 innings. He walked Ray Durham and Tony Graffanino to
start the first and after a double steal, Ordonez hit a two-run
double and Carlos Lee followed with an RBI single to make it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Konkerko singled in the second and made it to third when
Parrish picked up Chris Singleton's bunt and threw it into center
field. Charles Johnson walked to load the bases and after Ray
Durham hit into a double play, Parrish walked Graffanino to reload
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Thomas hit an RBI single and then Ordonez drew a
bases-loaded walk to finish Parrish and make it 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Richard hit his fifth homer for Baltimore's first run in
the fourth. But Chicago loaded the bases again in the fourth off
Jason Johnson and got two gift runs when third baseman Jeff Conine
collided with Richard and dropped Carlos Lee's two-out popup near
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Hairston and Brady Anderson hit back-to-back solo shots
and Melvin Mora singled to finish Lowe in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Lorenzo Barcelo (1-1) was tagged for a solo homer by Conine in
the sixth to make it 7-4, but Thomas hit an RBI double off the
center field fence in the bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, making his first start since May 31, 1998 when he was with
the Cardinals and just the sixth of his major league career in 116
appearances, gave up five hits and three runs in 4 1-3 innings. He
was activated from the disabled list Wednesday where he'd been
since Aug 1. with an inflamed right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
Notes: When Lowe was activated, rookie RHP Jon Garland went on the
DL with a bruise on his right arm, sustained when he was hit by a
Fred McGriff line drive last Friday ... Parrish threw 49 pitches in
his brief outing and only 19 were for strikes. ... Barcelo, who
allowed just two hits and a run in 3 1-3 innings, got his first
major league win. He's given up just two earned runs in his last
nine relief appearances, spanning 14 2-3 innings.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 15, Astros 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Ruben Quevedo took a no-hit bid into the sixth
inning before Julio Lugo's three-run homer, and the Chicago Cubs
routed the Houston Astros 15-5 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Quevedo (2-5), making his eighth major league start, wound up
allowing five runs -- three earned -- and four hits in eight innings.
The 21-year-old right-hander struck out five and walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Wade Miller (2-5) was pounded for 12 runs, tying the Astros
record set by Jose Lima against the Cubs on April 26. Miller lasted
4 2-3 innings, allowing 12 hits and eight earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi had four hits, Gary Matthews Jr. had three and Mark
Grace hit a three-run double as Chicago stopped a season-high,
seven-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White had two hits and drove in a run, making him
8-for-14 with five RBIs in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa put the Cubs ahead with an RBI single in the first,
then robbed Lugo of a home run in the bottom half with a leaping
catch against the right-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, which tied its season high by making four errors,
helped Chicago with a pair of errors as the Cubs took a 6-0 lead:
Jeff Bagwell dropped a throw to first by shortstop Tim Bogar, and
catcher Mitch Meluskey made a throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   White and Girardi hit RBI singles, Willie Greene had a
run-scoring double catch against the right field wall.
</P>
<P>
   Matthews hit an RBI single and scored on Jeff Huson's two-run
double for a 9-0 lead in the fifth and Grace fouled off Joe
Slusarski.
</P>
<P>
   Lugo's homer came with two outs and followed walks to Bogar and
Roger Cedeno.
</P>
<P>
   Girardi hit an RBI single in the eighth off Jason Green for his
fourth hit. Glen Barker added a two-run single in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Matthews was in an 0-for-15 slide coming into the series
and went 4-for-6. ... Moises Alou is hitting .438 (21-for-48) in
his last 13 games. ... Chicago's Eric Young snapped an 0-for-13
streak with a double in the first inning. ... Bogar has more than
doubled his batting average since the All-Star break. Bogar, who
hit .132 before the break, is hitting .261 (18-for-69) since play
resumed. ... The 15 runs allowed by Houston is a season-high. The
15 runs scored by Chicago ties a season-high.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 10, Rangers 9  </HEADLINE>
By JOSH DUBOW
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Jorge Posada went 3-for-4 with a homer and five
RBIs and Tino Martinez hit a game-winning RBI single in the ninth
inning to give the New York Yankees a 10-9 victory over the Texas
Rangers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   New York won despite stranding 14 runners in the first eight
innings, blowing a 7-4 lead and making two errors in a five-run
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Posada's two-run homer in the eighth tied it for the Yankees,
who then won it an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Polonia led off with a single against Tim Crabtree (2-7)
and went to second on Jose Vizcaino's single. Jose Canseco hit into
a fielder's choice, beating out a double play when Luis Alicea's
throw pulled Frank Catalanotto off the bag at first.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Venafro came on and Martinez grounded a single
just inside the first-base bag. The Yankees poured out of the
dugout in jubilation and the crowd that booed its team in the
eighth inning celebrated.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera (7-3) escaped a shaky ninth for the win. With
runners on first and second, second baseman Vizcaino started a neat
double play, going to his knees to stop Gabe Kapler's grounder up
the middle.
</P>
<P>
   After an intentional walk to Ledee, Pedro Valdes hit a grounder
back to the box that Rivera knocked down and made the play at
first.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees kept up their dominance of the Rangers, winning for
the 41st time in 54 games since losing Game 1 of the 1996
divisional series. New York, which swept the Rangers out of the
playoffs the past two years, is 32-9 against Texas at Yankee
Stadium since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers likely won't be making a return trip in the
postseason. Their 68th loss in 115 games already surpasses last
year's total by one. Texas allowed 10 or more runs for the 22nd
time this season, breaking the franchise record set in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' bullpen cost Clemens his seventh straight win for
the second time in two starts. He left last Friday's game against
Anaheim with an 8-3 lead in the ninth, but the Angels tied it on Mo
Vaughn's three-run homer off Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Former Yankees outfielder Ricky Ledee erased a 7-4 lead in the
eighth with a three-run shot off Mike Stanton. The Rangers then put
runners on second and third without hitting a ball more than 25
feet. Jeff Nelson committed an error on Bill Haselman's swinging
bunt and Posada misplayed Mike Lamb's sacrifice for another error.
</P>
<P>
   After Nelson cleanly fielded Royce Clayton's sacrifice bunt, the
fans gave the Yankees mock applause. With runners on second and
third, Alicea singled through a drawn-in infield to give Texas the
9-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler hit a two-run double and Haselman and Rusty Greer had
solo homers off Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill had a pair of RBI singles off Kenny Rogers, and
Posada added a sacrifice fly and an RBI double. Luis Sojo's double
off Jeff Zimmerman made it 7-4 in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers gave up six runs, 11 hits and four walks in five-plus
innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Rangers went 12 straight games without scoring in the
first inning before getting four Tuesday and two Wednesday. ...
O'Neill left after the seventh inning as a precautionary measure to
protect his sore right hip. ... Jeter walked for the 10th straight
game, the second longest streak in the majors this season (Brian
Giles, 11) and tied for the longest by a Yankee since Jesse
Barfield in 1990. ... Catalanotto was picked off by Clemens in the
first and Stanton in the seventh. ... The Rangers haven't won
consecutive games since taking four straight July 25-28.

<HEADLINE> Florida Keys Evacuate Visitors  </HEADLINE>
By MILDRADE CHERFILS
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Visitors were ordered to leave the Florida Keys on
Wednesday as officials prepared for the possibility that Tropical
Storm Debby could hit Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County, which encompasses the island chain, declared a
state of emergency with Debby still hundreds of miles away. County
officials ordered about 15,000 people to evacuate to the mainland,
spokesman Andy Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters predicted the storm would move over Cuba by Thursday
afternoon, then turn north into the Gulf of Mexico. Depending on
how soon Debby turns, the storm could brush by the Keys and the
west coast of Florida, forecasters said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main concern right now is for the Keys,'' said Max
Mayfield, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   A tropical storm warning or watch could be issued for the Keys
as early as Thursday morning, Mayfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to put up any warnings or watches for the
eastern part of Florida,'' Mayfield said. ''(But) we don't want to
minimize the rainfall effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Kirkland, dockmaster for Whale Harbor Inn &AMP; Marina,
said it was business as usual at the Keys fishing resort on
Islamorada, about 65 miles southwest of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ''The skies are clear -- a couple of little puffy clouds up there
-- but it's a beautiful day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some charter boat captains canceled trips set for
Saturday, state and county parks and private campgrounds were
instructed to close by noon, and all large recreational vehicles,
travel trailers and tent campers were ordered out.
</P>
<P>
   Monroe County schools will be closed Thursday and Friday.
Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park south of Miami
shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said that in readying to evacuate,
Floridians should remember people who might need extra help. ''They
ought to make sure their neighbors who may be frail and shut-in are
also taken care of,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   His older brother, Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush, may cancel a campaign visit if the storm continues its path
toward South Florida. ''When you have a storm, a hurricane, coming
to a particular part of our state, politics is put aside,'' the
governor said.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, in Cape Canaveral, Kennedy Space Center workers
took plywood and sandbags out of storage to be put up in case the
storm veered in that direction. Space shuttle Atlantis could be
moved off a launch pad into its hangar if it were threatened.
</P>
<P>
   In the Keys, an automated calling system was activated to
contact more than 300 hotels and guest houses along the 180-mile
island chain with a recorded message about the evacuation. Hotels
were asked to post notices and contact guests.
</P>
<P>
   The system was developed to ease evacuations along the Overseas
Highway, a mostly two-lane road that is the only route to the
mainland from the low-lying islands.
</P>
<P>
   The state emergency operations center in Tallahassee, which
coordinates government response to all major emergencies, went to a
higher staffing level Wednesday, according to spokesman Ian Smith.
The center notified emergency workers they may be needed to assist
local governments as the storm approaches.
</P>
<P>
   Many South Floridians weren't taking any chances. Some raced to
stores and stuffed shopping carts with bottled water, canned food,
milk and batteries, and the truly nervous hefted portable
generators onto truck beds.
</P>
<P>
   A soaking rain would be welcome throughout the state, said Terry
McElroy, spokesman for the state Agriculture Department. ''We're
out of wildfire danger, but the aquifer and the lakes and so on are
low,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent hurricane to hit South Florida was Irene, blamed
for seven deaths last October. The storm flooded much of the resort
city of Key West with up to 10 inches of rain.

<HEADLINE> Harry Potter Film Star Introduced  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Movie giant Warner Bros. introduced 11-year-old
actor and future wizard Daniel Radcliffe to media Muggles on
Wednesday, as the publicity machine for Harry Potter's film foray
kicked into first gear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harry Potter and The Sorcerer's Stone,'' due to be released in
the United States next year, is based on the first of four
sales-shattering books by author J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel, already a seasoned actor from southwest London with two
film credits, said he burst into tears when he learned he'd won the
title role of the orphan boy invited to study at Hogwarts School of
Witchcraft and Wizardry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I cried and I was just really excited,'' he said, wearing
distinctive round Harry Potter-style glasses as he held court
before several hundred reporters and photographers.
</P>
<P>
   But Daniel, who listed professional wrestling among his top
interests, admitted he'd given up on reading the Potter books after
the first two installments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have, since then, completely forgotten everything about it,
so my dad has just started reading me the first book again and
after that I am going to read the second, third and fourth,'' he
said, adding that his only real-life similarity to the books' hero
is that he'd like to own an owl.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel also let slip that his distinctive glasses were part of
the act. ''I am supposed to have glasses, but I never wear them,''
he divulged
</P>
<P>
   In the first book, Harry discovers that there are two worlds --
the dreary world of the ordinary Muggles where he's grown up, and
one of magic and fantasy. A muggle in wizard speak is an ordinary
human.
</P>
<P>
   ''Home Alone'' director Chris Columbus said he hoped the initial
film would be one in a series covering all seven planned Potter
novels, and that Rowling would oversee the screenplays.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, the complexity of the books in terms of the special
effects makes it a little difficult to do one of these films a
year, so obviously there will be a point when the children outgrow
their roles,'' said Columbus, who wouldn't reveal whether Daniel
had been signed to a multi-picture deal.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus also said he planned to shoot parallel versions of the
first film -- one for the U.S. market and one for Britain. His plan
is to shoot two or three alternate sequences for each film and to
give the British film the first novel's original title, ''Harry
Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.'' The American film will be
called, ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Filming is due to begin later this year, Columbus said.
</P>
<P>
   Dame Maggie Smith and Robbie Coltrane also have signed on to
appear in the first film, but the spotlight at Wednesday's press
conference was solely on Daniel and two other pint-sized actors --
Emma Watson, 10, and Rupert Grint, 11, who will play Harry's best
friends, the bookish Hermione Granger and red-haired Ron Weasly.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel told reporters that his success in landing the lead role
had made some of his classmates jealous.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of the other boys in the class know that I've only read
the first one or two and it's very strange, because these boys are
complete fanatics and they have read all the books, and the
American versions, so I think they are a bit angry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert, who likes football and ''hanging out'' with his friends,
said he could relate to his character because he, too, had a
redheaded sister and a similar personality.
</P>
<P>
   The eminently articulate Emma, who denied she was a ''top form
goody-two shoes,'' told reporters she was midway through the fourth
Potter novel and listed school studies as among her favorite
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about her preferred magical spell, she replied, ''I'd
probably quite like to have lasting friends -- people who you could
have all the time, who wouldn't go away just because you're a film
star.''

<HEADLINE> With: Clinton-Schools  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - Malaika Carpenter is like many
14-year-olds striving to learn in this rapidly growing Middlesex
County bedroom community: she spent seventh and eighth grades in
trailers outside her school, jammed in with hundreds of other
students who couldn't fit inside the main building.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike most 14-year-olds, Carpenter was able to speak
directly to the president of the United States about her school's
plight.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton stopped at Crossroads Middle School Wednesday
to urge Congress to pass a plan to fund construction of 6,000 new
schools, and renovate another 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would enable New Jersey school districts to issue
$660 million worth of interest-free bonds to finance $330 million
worth of New construction. The president also proposes $6.5 billion
in grants and loans nationwide to help school districts repair
crumbling, older facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stood at a podium in front of a weathered, gray trailer
behind the school - one of 21 temporary facilities South Brunswick
uses to educate more than 2,200 students. That's 20 percent more
than they're designed to hold.
</P>
<P>
   He urged the crowd of about 1,000 parents, students and
educators to contact their representatives and demand that they
support the school funding plan
</P>
<P>
   ''All over America, our faculties are better than our
facilities,'' he said. ''New Jersey has its highest enrollment in
years. If you were to take a roll call here in New Jersey, 1.3
million students would answer it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is, you've got all these kids going into schools
that were never built to hold this many,'' he said. ''I believe the
federal government has a responsibility to help the states deal
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter told Clinton how hard it was to learn, concentrate,
and sometimes even walk inside the trailers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I recall many times having to run into the main building to
escape the rain,'' she said. ''The other students teased us about
having to run through the rain and attend classes in trailers.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the classrooms were half the size of normal ones, with
little room for tables, chairs and books. It was hard to move
around inside them, and students inside were easily distracted by
the voices of others passing by outside, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal financing bill would issue $25 billion worth of
bonds to fund construction of 6,000 new schools nationwide.
Bondholders would get tax credits instead of interest payments from
local districts, allowing the districts to borrow interest-free.
Clinton said the proposal would cost $2.4 billion over the next
five years.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress approves the plan, New Jersey districts would be
able to use $330 million in bond revenues to build new schools. Of
that amount, $178 million would go to school districts in Camden,
Jersey City, Newark and Paterson.
</P>
<P>
   The president cited a federal Education Department report
showing that New Jersey's public school enrollment is at its
highest in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's plan would be separate from the $8.6 billion New
Jersey recently appropriated for school construction.
</P>
<P>
   South Brunswick, where the student enrollment has doubled to
about 7,000 students over the last decade, is experiencing the kind
of rapid growth that is straining classrooms - not to mention
budgets - throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Located halfway between New York and Philadelphia, near the New
Jersey Turnpike and Route 1, the township is seeing an influx of
new residents flocking to pricey developments with names such as
Falcongate.
</P>
<P>
   Chickens still cross the road in South Brunswick; one ambled
across the pavement in front of the school shortly before the
president arrived. But open spaces are quickly giving way to strip
malls, car dealerships, office parks and fast-food joints here.
</P>
<P>
   ''It started off very rural-feeling, very small and cozy,'' said
Elise Weitz, a teacher in South Brunswick whose 11-year-old son,
Ethan, will attend class in the Crossroads trailers next month. The
quiet pace was why she and her family moved here from Philadelphia
11 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Weitz said, ''It's crowded, class sizes are larger, and
buildings are bursting with children. We're squeezing kids into
buildings until solutions are in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Schools Superintendent Samuel B. Stewart is unhappy with the
trailer arrangement, but says there's no immediate alternative. The
district's population is growing so fast it could fill a new school
building every two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't build the kind of unified school community you want
to build with trailers,'' he said. ''This is a problem throughout
New Jersey.''

<HEADLINE> Judge denies bail to mob informant  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - After convicted child molester Philip Casale
admitted in November to being a mobster and taking part in two
murders, federal prosecutors wanted him to remain free.
</P>
<P>
   He helped make undercover recordings that persuaded another
member of the northern New Jersey faction of Philadelphia's Bruno
crime to plead guilty and agree to testify against their reputed
boss, Joseph ''Skinny Joey'' Merlino.
</P>
<P>
   That changed this spring, and prosecutors persuaded a judge to
jail Casale.
</P>
<P>
   Casale was back in court on Wednesday, seeking bail. His lawyer,
Assistant Federal Public Defender Chester M. Keller, offered no
reason during the two-minute hearing why his client should get
bail.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors opposed the bid. ''The defendant's pro-active
cooperation has been concluded,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Laura J.
Kaplan said, noting that Casale faces up to 20 years without parole
for pleading guilty to a racketeering charge that included
participation in two murders.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise said the seriousness
of Casale's crimes bars bail.
</P>
<P>
   Outside court, Keller offered no grounds for the request, but
said Casale was not having problems in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Casale did not speak during the hearing, during which he was
shackled at the wrists and ankles. He wore prison-issue khakis and
white sneakers.
</P>
<P>
   Casale's guilty plea in November was closed to the public, and
Casale was freed on an unsecured $100,000 bond after agreeing to
report daily to the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Casale gathered evidence, including tapes, that led Peter ''The
Crumb'' Caprio, the captain or ''capo'' of the North Jersey
faction, to plead guilty on July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Debevoise jailed Casale on June 23 at the request of federal
prosecutors in Newark, Kaplan said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was a point in time that we received certain information
that led us to seek to revoke his bail,'' Kaplan said. She declined
to specify that information.
</P>
<P>
   Casale, 56, and Caprio, 70, are being held at undisclosed
locations. Plea deals with both say that the U.S. attorney's office
in Newark will sponsor their applications into the Witness
Protection Program.
</P>
<P>
   Even if admitted to the program, it is unclear when either would
walk free. They can be in the program while in custody, and no
sentencing dates have been set.
</P>
<P>
   Casale was convicted in 1977 in Essex County of assault,
lewdness, attempted carnal abuse and robbery in connection with the
molestation of a 10-year-old Newark girl he had lured into an
abandoned building with the promise of candy.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he had already served time for bank robbery.
</P>
<P>
   He was imprisoned until 1985, when he was released from a state
facility for sex offenders.
</P>
<P>
   In his plea, Caprio admitted roles in the 1994 shooting death of
crew associate William Gantz in 1994 and the 1996 slaying of Joseph
Sodano, a Bruno ''capo.''
</P>
<P>
   During the July proceeding, Caprio said yes when asked if
Merlino and former Philadelphia mob boss Ralph Natale ordered him
to kill Sodano because Sodano refused to respond to Natale's
requests to report to Natale and Merlino in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Caprio ordered Casale to kill Sodano, and Casale shot him to
death in December 1996, Caprio said.
</P>
<P>
   Natale pleaded guilty in May, becoming what is believed to be
the highest-ranking mobster to cooperate with prosecutors. He has
been turning over mob compatriots to the government since his
arrest last summer on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Merlino is awaiting trial on racketeering and murder charges.

<HEADLINE> 143 Dead in Gulf Air Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
By ADNAN MALIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- A Gulf Air Airbus A320 crashed into
shallow Persian Gulf waters Wednesday night after circling and
trying to land in Bahrain, killing all 143 people aboard, including
36 children, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   All bodies were recovered and there were no survivors, Bahraini
Civil Defense Commander Brigadier Abdul-Rahman Bin Rashed Al
Khalifa said on state-run television.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on what caused the crash. Civil
aviation authorities had said searchers also recovered both flight
data recorders, but later corrected that, saying only the flight
data recorder had been found. The search continued for the cockpit
voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Navy helicopters, destroyers and an oceangoing tug with a
10-ton crane joined the nighttime search in about 40 feet of water
three or four miles off the northern coast of Bahrain, which is
headquarters of the U.S. 5th Fleet.
</P>
<P>
   An air traffic controller at the Bahrain airport, reached by
telephone, described watching the plane attempt to land.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plane was near the runway, but didn't land,'' he said,
asking that his name not be used. ''It circled two times and the
third time it crashed into the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The controller saw no flames or sign of trouble before the crash
and could not immediately explain why the plane circled before
landing. He said the plane's crew did not report anything out of
the ordinary. He gave the time of the crash as 7:20 p.m. (12:20
p.m. EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Al-Hamer, Bahrain's undersecretary for civil aviation,
said the circling was not unusual and the crew reported nothing out
of the ordinary. He said that the captain had 21 years of
experience. He did not name the captain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I could not believe my eyes,'' said Sobeih, 27, a resident of
the nearby neighborhood of Al-Fodha who saw the plane go down.
''When I saw it heading toward the sea nose down, I screamed 'Oh my
God, this thing is going down.'''
</P>
<P>
   Sobeih and Riyadh, 24, another Al-Fodha resident, said the plane
flew unusually low over their heads heading to the runway, but took
a sharp turn toward the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Both men, who would not give their full names, said the plane
returned minutes later flying even lower but headed straight to the
sea where it crashed. They said unusual noises came from the
plane's engines, but they saw no flames.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was in a state of shock,'' said Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air said in a statement that 135 passengers and eight crew
members were on board GF072, an evening Cairo-Bahrain flight. Lists
of passengers' names showed that 36 were under the age of 18, but
they didn't appear to be traveling in any sort of group.
Sixty-three passengers were Egyptian, 34 Bahraini, 12 Saudi, nine
Palestinian, six from the United Arab Emirates, three Chinese, two
British and one each from Canada, Oman, Kuwait, Sudan and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   And one passenger was believed to be an American. A State
Department official in Washington said Bahraini officials had
informed them that a boarding pass indicated that a U.S. diplomatic
courier was aboard. The courier's name was not immediately
released.
</P>
<P>
   The crew included two Bahrainis and one each from Oman, the
Philippines, Poland, India, Morocco and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Weeping relatives of passengers pleaded with policemen who threw
a security ring around the airport outside the capital, Manama.
Many did reach the airport, and cries and screams echoed in its
halls. Dozens of men and women with reddened eyes and tears flowing
down their cheeks wept loudly. Some comforted one another while
others screamed out for their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Three U.S. helicopters, 10 small boats and the USS Katawba, a
tug, joined Bahraini helicopters and boats in the search. Bahraini
Crown Prince Sheik Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa personally directed
the effort, the U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military pulled back three of the ships it had lent to
the effort as the search geared down early Thursday, 5th Fleet
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of passengers also gathered at the airport in Cairo.
There were angry scenes when one relative tried to attack news
cameramen and complained about the lack of information on the fate
of the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air is owned by Bahrain, the Gulf states of Oman and Qatar,
as well as Abu Dhabi, the largest of seven sheikdoms making up the
United Arab Emirates. Based in Bahrain, it flies to 53
international destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, the emir of Bahrain, declared
three days of mourning and said a committee of Bahraini and foreign
experts would investigate the crash. In France, Airbus Industrie
said it was dispatching a team of specialists to Bahrain to help in
the investigation. Al-Hamer, the civil aviation official, said
Bahrain has asked the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board for
assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The Airbus plane, delivered to Gulf Air in September 1994, had
accumulated about 17,177 flight hours in some 13,848 flights, the
Airbus statement said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, an Airbus A310 owned by Kenya Airways crashed into
Atlantic Ocean shortly after takeoff from Abidjan, Ivory Coast, to
Lagos, Nigeria. Ten people survived, and 169 died. An Air Inter
Airbus A320 crashed in 1992 in Strasbourg, France, killing 87
people.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air's most recent previous disaster came in 1983, when a
737-200 crashed during approach to Abu Dhabi after a bomb exploded
in the baggage compartment. The crash killed all six crew members
and 105 of 111 passengers.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Pilot Aborts Landing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG (AP) -- A Cathay Pacific Airways pilot aborted a
landing after seeing he was heading straight for a Lufthansa jet
about to take off, an official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Ng, a Civil Aviation Department spokeswoman, said the
runway should have been clear but it was too soon to say what had
gone wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's air traffic controllers have come under scrutiny
after several cases of airplanes flying too closely to one another
near Hong Kong. But Ng said the incident Sunday might not have been
an air traffic control problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ng was not certain whether any air traffic controllers had been
temporarily suspended from regular duties, which has happened in at
least two airborne incidents this year at Chek Lap Kok airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Cathay cargo jet, a Boeing 747, was coming in from Taipei,
Taiwan, when the pilot saw he was coming up behind the Lufthansa
passenger jet bound for Frankfurt, Germany, and flew around to make
another landing approach
</P>
<P>
   Cathay did not immediately return phone calls Thursday. A
Lufthansa spokeswoman said only that the German carrier's flight
took off without incident.

<HEADLINE> School Vouchers Urged For Minorities  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Virginia Walden-Ford grew up a true believer
in public schools. Her father was a top administrator in the
District of Columbia school system and her sisters taught there.
</P>
<P>
   But she now thinks blacks should get government financial aid to
attend private schools. On Thursday, she joined a group of black
parents, educators, pastors and politicians to launch an ad
campaign for the idea that's been championed by Republican
presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the first time I've seen a way for black kids to get
out of bad schools,'' said Walden-Ford, the mother of a teen-age
charter school student and past proponent of unsuccessful efforts
to bring publicly funded vouchers to the District of Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's more than 8 million black school-age children
should have the means to leave bad public schools, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Black Democratic leaders traditionally have opposed the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vouchers are a tax break for parents who already have children
in private schools,'' says Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr., D- Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Alliance for Educational Options, the bipartisan group
that supports vouchers, will run ads starting Sunday in newspapers
mostly serving predominantly black communities, featuring Education
Department statistics on the growing gulf between blacks and whites
in school performance.
</P>
<P>
   The group believes the numbers are alarming enough to persuade
black parents to support and demand school-choice programs -- and
inject black leadership into a movement that's needed by poor black
families but led by white social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very important to build up grass roots support; only rich
black conservatives have led the charge and that's not really the
face of school choice,'' said Nina Shokraii Rees, an education
analyst with the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the pro-voucher group say they aren't trying to help
Bush, who wants to give vouchers to kids in poor schools that don't
show improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers unions strongly oppose vouchers, as does Vice President
Al Gore, although the idea has been supported by his running mate,
Connecticut Sen. Joseph Lieberman.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know who people are voting for and I don't care; our
view is that our kids have been suffering,'' said Howard Fuller,
the former Milwaukee schools chief who has championed that city's
experimental voucher program.
</P>
<P>
   But Fuller, who's voting for Bush, said, ''We don't believe the
old 
'just-elect-the-same-people-because-everything-is-going-to-be-better
' answer is going to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelitha Harrelson, a New York City office manager, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parents want to see action; we don't want to see talk,'' said
Harrelson, who's sending 10-year-old Brittney to a $23,000-a-year
upper East Side academy with help from private scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   Recent polls and surveys conflict on whether the public, either
black or white, supports vouchers. There are a handful of small,
experimental programs -- in states such as Ohio, Florida, Vermont
and Wisconsin -- that give poor children public money to attend
private, parochial or specially chartered public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, 78 percent of private school students are white; 9
percent are black and 8 percent are Hispanic.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say vouchers do not address the educational ills that
tend to hit predominantly minority schools the worst -- crowded
crumbling buildings, violence, low test scores and high dropout
rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''Green public dollars for black private education is just as
unconstitutional as green public dollars for white private
education,'' said Jackson, who says an equal-education amendment to
the U.S. Constitution would give poor communities the legal backing
to demand better funding from state coffers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have little to worry about, said David Bositis, an
expert on black voting patterns with the Joint Center for Political
and Economic Studies in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican Party is not viewed by African Americans as a
viable alternative, and vouchers are not going to change that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if more blacks do support voucher initiatives, that
wouldn't be enough to get them enacted, he said. ''Look at who will
vote against it ... senior citizens, white suburbanites and the
teachers unions. That's a winning combination.''

<HEADLINE> British News Crew Denied Bail  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- Four members of a British television
news crew charged with espionage by Liberia have been denied bail.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Timothy Swote said the team from London-based Insight News
Television -- Sierra Leonean Sorious Samura, Britons David Barrie
and Tim Lambon and South African Gugu Radebe -- could face the death
penalty and so could not be granted bail.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Varney Sherman disputed that espionage was
punishable by death and said he would appeal the decision to deny
bail. According to Sherman, the most the journalists could get is
10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said the four were being abused in jail. ''They were
threatened. They put cockroaches into their cell,'' he said. ''They
even threatened that they will cut them up.''
</P>
<P>
   The four men, dressed in street clothes and rubber sandals,
appeared tired and dejected in court Wednesday. They were arrested
Friday at their hotel in Monrovia, capital of the West African
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say their videotapes contained material ''damaging''
to the Liberian government. The indictment said the documentary
they were making would try to support British and American
allegations that Liberia is involved in diamond smuggling and gun
running for rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Insight News says the men are bona fide journalists and had
official permission to work in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Jimmy Carter added his voice Wednesday to the
growing chorus of international appeals for the team's release.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their detention will only bring further international scrutiny
on Liberia's commitment to basic human rights,'' Carter said in a
letter to President Charles Taylor.

<HEADLINE> Rescuer Defends Russian Navy  </HEADLINE>
By ANNA DOLGOV
<TEXT>
<P>
   MURMANSK, Russia (AP) -- A Russian naval officer who led the
effort to rescue the sunken submarine Kursk -- and whose son was
among the 118 sailors aboard -- insists that the navy did all it
could to save the men. And he grieves that the efforts failed.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Vladimir Giletin conceded bitterly Wednesday that the
Russian navy, ravaged by a severe lack of funding since the 1991
Soviet collapse, has no modern rescue methods or equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''I attended to this work and, as a father, I was probably more
interested in seeing it done right than anybody else,'' Giletin
told reporters in Murmansk, the Arctic city where the Northern
Fleet is headquartered.
</P>
<P>
   Giletin's face was momentarily distorted by grief, and he
clenched his hands so hard his knuckles turned white, before
regaining his composure.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian navy has been strongly criticized for bungling the
rescue operation. The Northern Fleet has no deep-sea divers, but it
resisted foreign help for days after the Kursk went down in the
Barents Sea on Aug. 12. Russia relied on rescue capsules that were
too weak to fight strong currents and could not latch onto the
submarine's escape hatch.
</P>
<P>
   When foreign help was finally accepted and Norwegian divers
pried open an escape hatch of the Kursk on Monday, the submarine
had been completely flooded and all aboard were dead.
</P>
<P>
   But Giletin insisted that Russian rescuers were guided by the
best of motivations, believing that their submersible equipment
would help save the Kursk sailors without a need for divers.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Giletin's son Boris, a senior officer on the Kursk,
was the second blow the family suffered in recent weeks. Giletin's
2-year-old grandson, Boris' son, died just a month ago, said
Northern Fleet spokesman Vladimir Navrotsky, without giving
details.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of the Kursk was a devastating blow to Russians
nationwide, and the country mourned Wednesday in churches, on
television and at home with family.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Kursk crew were killed when the submarine was
shattered by a huge explosion that sent it crashing to the ocean
floor, naval experts said. It remains unclear whether anybody
survived more than a few hours following the catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Russian naval officials gave contradictory accounts of the
tragedy. Some insist that rescuers heard sailors tapping on the
hull of the submarine until Aug. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Giletin insisted that he heard tapping, but he said the sounds
could be the sounds of equipment falling apart inside the
submarine.
</P>
<P>
   ''We heard sounds, but the nature of these sounds, whether they
were made by people or were purely mechanical, nobody knows,''
Giletin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If one really wants to, all sounds heard on a submarine can be
interpreted as made by humans,'' he said. ''And we really wanted
people to be alive.''

Study: Diabetes Up Sharply in 1990s

<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Diabetes increased at an alarming rate in the United States
during the past decade -- rising 70 percent among people in their 30s -- and
health experts are blaming the wired-up, couch-potato culture of the 1990s.
Diabetes is closely tied to obesity, and doctors say the higher incidence of the
disease is due in large part to America's weight problem. Obesity is ''not just
a cosmetic issue anymore,'' said Dr. Frank Vinicor, director of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's diabetes division.

Verizon, Telephone Workers Reach Agreement
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Negotiators for Verizon Communications and more than
35,000 telephone workers reached tentative agreement on a new contract tonight,
ending an 18-day strike in six mid-Atlantic states and the District of Columbia.
The company and the last of three bargaining units settled on a three-year
contract covering workers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland,
Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Union representatives for
50,000 other workers in New York and New England already agreed to a package
Sunday night. All three contracts still need to be ratified by unions members.

<HEADLINE> Mets 4, Padres 1  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Al Leiter restored order to New York's pitching
staff, allowing only three hits in eight innings and retiring 14
straight batters as the Mets beat the San Diego Padres 4-1
Wednesday night to avoid a three-game sweep.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter (14-5) struck out 12 to match his season high, won for
the fifth time in six decisions and beat the Padres for the second
time this year.
</P>
<P>
   His effort came a day after the Mets were embarrassed 16-1.
Tuesday's game got so out of hand that right fielder Derek Bell
pitched the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter's only mistake was giving up Damian Jackson's homer to
left on a 2-0 count with one out in the first. It was Jackson's
second homer in as many games; he hit a grand slam off Tuesday's
shell-shocked spot starter, Pat Mahomes.
</P>
<P>
   After Jackson's homer, Leiter retired 14 straight batters, eight
by strikeout. Jackson broke the string with a leadoff single in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez struck out the side in the ninth for his 34th
save in 37 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick drove in the Mets' first two runs, and New York
benefited from Matt Clement's wildness in the three-run sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick twice came up with the bases loaded. He singled past
diving third baseman Phil Nevin to drive in New York's first run,
in the fourth. In the sixth, he was hit by a full-count pitch from
Clement to drive in Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza and Darryl Hamilton drew consecutive four-pitch walks to
open the sixth, and Benny Agbayani singled with one out. After
Bordick was hit, Leiter's bunt was fielded by Clement, who flipped
it home to force Hamilton, but the throw to first by catcher Wiki
Gonzalez hit Leiter in the back for an error, allowing Agbayani to
score. Lenny Harris then singled in Bordick.
</P>
<P>
   Clement (11-12) allowed four runs on seven hits and four walks
in 5 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: CF Ruben Rivera made a nice diving catch of Robin Ventura's
fly ball to end the fifth. ... Mets LHP Mike Hampton, who has a
fractured rib, will throw on the side Friday in New York and the
team will decide then whether he'll make or miss his next scheduled
start. He missed his start Tuesday. ... Piazza was back after
sitting out Tuesday's game with a swollen shin, but Edgardo Alfonzo
missed his second straight game, with a strained neck. ... Padres
farmhand Sean Burroughs was named to the U.S. Olympic team. He is
the son of 1974 AL MVP Jeff Burroughs, and led Long Beach to
consecutive Little League World Series in 1992-93. ... Nevin, who
has reached base safely in 44 straight games, struck out three
times.

<HEADLINE> Mexico's Fox Meeting Gore in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mexican president-elect Vicente Fox is using a
two-day visit to the United States to outline his vision for a
freer flow of people and goods across the border.
</P>
<P>
   After a morning meeting Thursday with Vice President Al Gore,
Fox planned an Oval Office visit with President Clinton and a
luncheon with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. He will meet
with Gov. George W. Bush in Dallas on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's proposal for an eventual opening of borders with United
States has been greeted with skepticism by U.S. business and labor
groups, but Clinton said Wednesday he wants to hear more before
making a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The devil is always in the details here, so I want to talk to
him about it and see what he has in mind,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada on Wednesday, Fox spoke to Prime Minister Jean
Chretien about his goal of an integrated North America modeled in
some respects after the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Chretien said he doesn't think it is feasible.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot establish relations between Canada, the United
States, and Mexico in the same type of situation as in Europe,'' he
said, adding that Canada wanted to maintain its own currency and
refused to consider a common currency like the euro.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said his goal was to promote prosperity, no matter the
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not proposing a common currency here,'' he said. ''We
don't think that would work. We're proposing to work together --
work on human development, economic development -- to narrow the
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite reservations about his border proposals, Fox has won
admiring comments from many Americans for having defeated the party
that has run Mexico for more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   They include some of Mexico's fiercest critics, such as Senate
Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Thomas Constantine, a former director of the Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Constantine said Wednesday he is impressed with Fox's
willingness to fight corruption and organized crime in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tend to be optimistic that an individual can change the
dynamics of a situation,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pitt Mobbed By Fans at Premiere  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Brad Pitt was mobbed by screaming fans when he
arrived for the premiere of his new movie.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd of 4,000 outside Leicester Square's Odeon cinema
surged forward Wednesday night, police told Pitt to move back to
prevent fans from being crushed against the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   No one was seriously injured but the episode put an end to the

   ''There were kids getting crushed at the front,'' Chief
Inspector John Moore said. ''I told Mr. Pitt that 'You owe it to
them not to put them in danger.'''
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy was sparked when the star stepped out of a
chauffeur-driven car alongside English director Guy Ritchie for the
premiere of ''Snatch.'' Pitt plays an Irish bare-knuckle boxer in
the gangster film.
</P>
<P>
   He told reporters that he chose the role because he ''liked the
story'' before being quickly ushered into the theater.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Sues Over Painting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Society of Professional Journalists has
asked a federal appeals court to reject a lawsuit filed by Tiger
Woods against an artist who sold copies of a painting of the
golfer.
</P>
<P>
   The Indianapolis-based organization says Woods' appeal threatens
First Amendment rights.
</P>
<P>
   Woods sued Alabama artist Rick Rush after he sold prints of a
painting he did on the golfer's Masters tournament victory in April
1997. Woods claims the sale violates his trademark and right of
publicity.
</P>
<P>
   Woods lost the first round of the lawsuit in April when a
Cleveland judge threw out the case, saying that trademark or
property rights laws do not protect Woods' image. The judge ruled
the First Amendment allows Rush to paint the golfer's image and
profit from copies of the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   The SPJ on Wednesday joined the Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press in filing a friend-of-the-court brief in the ongoing
case. The brief asks the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in Ohio to
reject Woods' appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was filed in Cleveland because Woods' company, ETW
Corp., is based there.
</P>
<P>
   SPJ and other organizations believe that if Woods' appeal is
successful, it would increase the potential for publicity rights
laws to extend into the newsgathering process.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Pinochet Appears in Public  </HEADLINE>
By EVA VERGARA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- A smiling, healthy-looking but mostly
silent Gen. Augusto Pinochet appeared in public Wednesday for the
first time since a Supreme Court ruled last month that he could be
tried on human rights charges.
</P>
<P>
   Walking fairly steadily but using a cane, the 84-year-old former
dictator attended a ceremony honoring hundreds of soldiers and
police allegedly killed by leftists during his 1973-90
dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   An official report by the civilian government that followed
Pinochet, however, said only 132 soldiers and police were killed,
compared to 3,192 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   The date also marked the 27th anniversary since Pinochet was
named army commander by Salvador Allende, the Marxist president he
overthrew in a bloody coup 19 days later.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rare public appearance by Pinochet since his return
home in March after 16 months under house arrest in London.
Pinochet, who had gone to London for back surgery, had to stay
until the British government decided he was too ill and mentally
unfit to be extradited to Spain to face human rights abuse charges
there.
</P>
<P>
   Since returning to Chile, Pinochet has remained mostly secluded
at his heavily guarded suburban home, leaving only for several
unannounced hospital visits.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony was held at the headquarters of the Pinochet
Foundation, a private group of his staunchest followers and former
aides. Pinochet rode in his regular motorcade of three armored
automobiles and under heavy security.
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped out of his vehicle, Pinochet raised his hand to
acknowledge noisy applause and cheering by about 150 backers
chanting: ''Pinochet, Chile's liberator.''
</P>
<P>
   Associates to Pinochet had said his public appearance marked the
beginning of a new, more active strategy in the face of his legal
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   In the main hall of the Foundation, Pinochet -- a huge portrait
of himself next to him -- sat flanked by foundation leaders and his
wife, Lucia Hiriart. He stood as the Chilean national anthem was
heard over loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   He was seen exchanging comments with people around him, but did
not make a speech. He cut a red, white and blue ribbon inaugurating
a plaque with the names of 447 soldiers and police officers the
Foundation says fell in attacks by leftists or terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet was stripped of his congressional immunity last month,
paving the way for his trial on human rights charges. The judge in
charge of the case, Juan Guzman, has set Oct. 9 as the date for his
first judicial questioning.
</P>
<P>
   After questioning Pinochet, Guzman must have him undergo medical
tests to determine whether he is mentally fit to stand trial. His
relatives and defense firmly oppose that step because Chilean law
only exempts people from trial if they are pronounced mad or
demented.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so, Pinochet supporters claim, would stain his image
before history. In that case, he prefers to be tried and fight in
court.
</P>
<P>
   Pinochet suffers from diabetes, has a pacemaker and suffered
three mild strokes during his London detention.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Debby Hits Haiti.  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Dumping drenching rains that caused
dangerous flooding, Tropical Storm Debby stalked northern Haiti and
forced thousands in Cuba to abandon homes as it pursued an erratic
course that could threaten the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Centered over northwest Haiti, Debby's winds dwindled from 75
mph Tuesday to 45 mph Wednesday and could weaken further over Cuba,
forecasters said. But they warned the storm could produce battering
waves, flash floods and mudslides -- and even strengthen again if it
reaches the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Keys can expect a tropical storm warning or watch as
early as Thursday morning, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main concern right now is for the Keys -- not for a
hurricane, but for a tropical storm,'' said Max Mayfield, director
of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Taking no chances, officials on Wednesday ordered visitors to
evacuate the Keys and shut down all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba evacuated at least 3,000 people, including Haitians at a
refugee camp, from the eastern end of the island. Officials planned
to evacuate thousands more -- including 700 tourists. Debby could
dump up to 15 inches of rain over mountainous areas, and
authorities predicted widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Haiti, shantytown dwellers fled their homes on
Turtle Island and huddled in shelters in driving rain. The storm
flooded homes in Port-de-Paix and ripped tin roofs off shacks.
Haiti's deforested mountains were clearly a worry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're especially afraid of heavy rain washing down from the
mountains. ... We don't have any canals, and flooding will cause a
lot of damage,'' said Smith Joseph, a journalist at private Radio
Etincelle in Port-de-Paix.
</P>
<P>
   He said high winds sank a boat in the harbor at the nearby
coastal village of Carenage.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Republic's emergency Civil Defense force said more
than 700 people in towns and cities on the north coast were forced
out of their homes by flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Debby was centered off the northwest
tip of Haiti over the Windward Passage. It was moving west near 16
mph, headed for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The storm should be over central Cuba by Thursday afternoon and
then move into the Gulf of Mexico, where it was expected to turn
north, brushing the west coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Debby was downgraded from hurricane status Wednesday when it
lost force in the mountains of Hispaniola. Still, workers in the
Dominican Republic evacuated dozens of people from riverside shacks
and soldiers in the Bahamas deployed to several southern islands
ahead of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   As a minor hurricane on Tuesday, Debby caused little damage to
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and small northeast Caribbean
islands. On Tuesday, a 78-year-old man died in a suburb of San
Juan, Puerto Rico's capital, when he slipped from his roof while
trying to dismantle an antenna.

<HEADLINE> Troops May Be Sent To Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Declaring that ''this is a crucial moment
for Sierra Leone,'' Secretary-General Kofi Annan told the nine
countries contributing troops to the U.N. peacekeeping force in the
war-battered nation they may have to provide more soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to counter Sierra Leone's notorious rebels, the
Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution this month
calling for an increase in the 13,000-member U.N. force and
spelling out ''priority tasks'' for the mission's success.
</P>
<P>
   Annan invited top military officers from the nine countries to
New York to listen to their views on strengthening the force before
he releases a report recommending how the U.N. mission should be
restructured and how many more troops it should have.
</P>
<P>
   In May, he recommended a force of 16,500 troops, but figures of
20,000, and even more, have been mentioned recently.
</P>
<P>
   Rebels from the Revolutionary United Front reignited Sierra
Leone's nine-year civil war in May by seizing about 500 U.N.
peacekeepers and keeping 233 others surrounded for 2&AMP;frac12; months,
severely embarrassing the United Nations and prompting a
reassessment of the U.N. mission.
</P>
<P>
   The officers from Bangladesh, Ghana, Guinea, India, Jordan,
Kenya, Nigeria, Russia and Zambia met with senior U.N. officials on
the same day a high-level international panel issued a report
calling for an overhaul of U.N. peacekeeping. Annan said it
included lessons for the Sierra Leone mission, known as UNAMSIL.
</P>
<P>
   ''The traditional model of peacekeeping -- lightly armed soldiers
operating in a permissive environment with the consent and
cooperation of responsible parties -- is making way for a more
robust and assertive type of peacekeeping, as is the case with
UNAMSIL,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-member panel concluded that the United Nations has to
assume ''a worst-case scenario'' and be prepared with the right
troops to respond with force if necessary, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Security Council's new mandate, U.N. troops in Sierra
Leone will concentrate on countering the rebels ''by responding
robustly to any hostile actions or threats of ... force,'' and on
helping the government extend its authority by deploying at key
strategic locations.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.N. official said Tuesday that some countries
contributing troops fear the Security Council is moving from
peacekeeping to ''peace enforcement,'' which would be tantamount to
going to war against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But the panel's report stressed that the United Nations should
stick to peacekeeping, ensuring that troops are well trained and
equipped and prepared to respond to any violence. U.N. officials
said this message was being conveyed to the officers.
</P>
<P>
   If the Sierra Leone mission is to succeed, Annan said, the troop
contributors and U.N. staff must solve three problems: ensure a
single command where ''all contingents must be equally willing and
ready to share the risks on the ground,'' make certain that poorly
equipped troops get the vehicles, tents, communications equipment
and other items they need, and ensure that every member of the U.N.
mission understands the mandate and rules of engagement.

<HEADLINE> U.S.Schools Deal With Meat Shortage  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- New safety standards for the national school
lunch program may have kids asking: Where's the beef?
</P>
<P>
   The government, which supplies free meat and other commodities
to the nation's schools, is having trouble finding affordable
ground beef after imposing the testing requirements on meat
processors this summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has purchased less than 40 percent of
the school-bound beef that it bought at this time last year and is
paying as much as 50 cents a pound more to get it.
</P>
<P>
   The new testing requirements for disease-causing microbes were
issued in June just before USDA started taking bids on its meat
purchases for the 2000-2001 school year.
</P>
<P>
   Patterned after standards set by fast-food chains, the
requirements are significantly tougher than those for meat sold in
grocery stores. Processors say the rules are unworkable.
</P>
<P>
   Some schools ''are doing menu changes; some are going to the
commercial market to buy product,'' said Barry Sackin, director of
government affairs for the American School Food Service
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not object to the food safety efforts that the
department is making. ... The precipitous nature of this is where
the problem lies, not the intent,'' said Sackin.
</P>
<P>
   The department is confident it will obtain enough beef to supply
school needs, spokesman Andy Solomon said Wednesday. The department
buys about 125 million pounds of beef a year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're committed to procuring high-quality, safe product for
use in the school lunch program and other federal feeding
programs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Illinois and Wisconsin have canceled their orders for USDA
beef for the entire year because of the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot discontinue serving hamburgers; it's a very popular
food. So we'll go out to our local suppliers and purchase ground
beef,'' said Marilyn Hurt, supervisor of nutrition programs for the
LaCrosse, Wis., school district.
</P>
<P>
   Meat that schools buy from commercial sources doesn't have to
meet USDA's new standards. Hurt said the LaCrosse school system has
enough ground beef in storage to accommodate its needs through the
first two to three months of the school year.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the new requirements for USDA-purchases say
the meat can contain no salmonella bacteria. But salmonella in
varying amounts is commonly found in meat.
</P>
<P>
   Meatpackers asked the department Aug. 1 to reconsider the
testing rules, saying in a letter that the program was ''unworkable
and detrimental to the agency's commodity procurement program, your
agency and the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department and meatpackers have been in a
dispute since December over salmonella testing for all beef sold in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Last May a federal judge prohibited the Food Safety and
Inspection Service from closing Supreme Beef Processors of Dallas,
which supplies about 15 percent of the ground beef for school
lunches, after its plant failed a series of salmonella tests.
</P>
<P>
   After the ruling, the department's Agricultural Marketing
Service slapped even more stringent testing requirements on meat it
purchases for school lunches.
</P>
<P>
   At this point a year ago, USDA had bought 35.5 million pounds of
beef. So far this summer, the department has purchased only 14
million pounds and has rejected several offers because the bids
were too high.
</P>
<P>
   Processors have been asking as much as $2.25 a pound for fine
ground beef, nearly twice what the department paid during the
1999-2000 school year.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Debby stalks Haiti, Cuba on path to Florida  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Dumping drenching rains that caused
dangerous flooding, Tropical Storm Debby stalked northern Haiti and
forced thousands in Cuba to abandon homes as it pursued an erratic
course that could threaten the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Centered over northwest Haiti, Debby's winds dwindled from 75
mph Tuesday to 45 mph Wednesday and could weaken further over Cuba,
forecasters said. But they warned the storm could produce battering
waves, flash floods and mudslides - and even strengthen again if it
reaches the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Keys can expect a tropical storm warning or watch as
early as Thursday morning, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main concern right now is for the Keys - not for a
hurricane, but for a tropical storm,'' said Max Mayfield, director
of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Taking no chances, officials on Wednesday ordered visitors to
evacuate the Keys and shut down all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba evacuated at least 3,000 people, including Haitians at a
refugee camp, from the eastern end of the island. Officials planned
to evacuate thousands more - including 700 tourists. Debby could
dump up to 15 inches of rain over mountainous areas, and
authorities predicted widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Haiti, shantytown dwellers fled their homes on
Turtle Island and huddled in shelters in driving rain. The storm
flooded homes in Port-de-Paix and ripped tin roofs off shacks.
Haiti's deforested mountains were clearly a worry.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're especially afraid of heavy rain washing down from the
mountains. ... We don't have any canals, and flooding will cause a
lot of damage,'' said Smith Joseph, a journalist at private Radio
Etincelle in Port-de-Paix.
</P>
<P>
   He said high winds sank a boat in the harbor at the nearby
coastal village of Carenage.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Republic's emergency Civil Defense force said more
than 700 people in towns and cities on the north coast were forced
out of their homes by flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Debby was centered off the northwest
tip of Haiti over the Windward Passage. It was moving west near 16
mph, headed for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The storm should be over central Cuba by Thursday afternoon and
then move into the Gulf of Mexico, where it was expected to turn
north, brushing the west coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Debby was downgraded from hurricane status Wednesday when it
lost force in the mountains of Hispaniola. Still, workers in the
Dominican Republic evacuated dozens of people from riverside shacks
and soldiers in the Bahamas deployed to several southern islands
ahead of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   As a minor hurricane on Tuesday, Debby caused little damage to
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and small northeast Caribbean
islands. On Tuesday, a 78-year-old man died in a suburb of San
Juan, Puerto Rico's capital, when he slipped from his roof while
trying to dismantle an antenna.

<HEADLINE> Bush Paring Down Campaign Schedule  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush doesn't seem to break a
sweat on the campaign trail, unless he's jogging.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Texas governor recently cut short a day of running
for president to make time for his three-mile run back home in
Texas, ordering his entourage to leave Memphis, Tenn. -- the site of
his only event -- several hours early.
</P>
<P>
   It was just the latest example of Bush maintaining a mix of down
time in his campaign schedule after the primary elections when he
increased his appearances in an effort to beat back a challenge by
Sen. John McCain. Since then, his preference for early bedtimes and
short campaign swings have prevailed, even after he and workaholic
rival Al Gore captured their parties' nominations and headed toward
Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   In the 17 days leading up to that traditional start of the fall
campaign season, Bush was scheduled to spend eight days at home in
Texas between several two- and three-day campaign swings.
</P>
<P>
   Bush contends that his White House bid isn't just an endurance
test.
</P>
<P>
   ''We continue to have an active schedule,'' Bush said recently,
seemingly amused that anyone would ask about it. ''I like the pace
I'm on.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People are going to make up their minds based upon who can
lead this country, who can change the tone in Washington, who's got
good ideas,'' he added. ''And I think we're making pretty good
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign says Bush's is a snail's pace, noting that the
Democratic nominee is just finishing a three-week marathon on the
hustings, with no days off. Where Bush typically speaks for no more
than 15 minutes at a time, Gore's meetings with undecided voters
can last for hours.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ''ludicrous to suggest that anyone is campaigning
harder than Al Gore,'' scoffed his spokesman, Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the two campaigns waged a schedule-measuring
contest. The result: Each did roughly the same number of events in
the seven days following the party nominating conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have sometimes touted their campaign activity as a
measure of how hard they would work as president and an indication
that they don't take votes for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Bush often expresses his humility on the stump this way: ''If I
am fortunate enough to be chosen. ...'' And he points to his record
as Texas governor as proof of his work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   He also has predicted that his schedule, which is carved out
weeks in advance, will get busier after Labor Day, eventually
putting him on the campaign trail five or six days a week.
</P>
<P>
   But his docket lately has been relaxed after a post-convention
train trip.
</P>
<P>
   ''You thought it was leisurely, coming down the train in
California? I didn't think it was so leisurely,'' he told
reporters. ''I think we've got a pretty hectic schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   His usual style reflects an easygoing personality wary of boring
his audience -- and himself -- according to one observer.
</P>
<P>
   ''He likes to work something close to eight hours a day, with
large blocks for running, and he likes to be home at night,'' said
Bruce Buchanan of the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor likes to be in bed by 9:30 p.m., and when
campaign events keep him out late he tends to jumble his words. On
Monday night, he bewildered Iowa campaign donors by stumbling
repeatedly during a 7:45 p.m. event, mistaking ''hostile'' for
''hostage'' and twice listing ''entrepreneurs'' in a short list of
those he seeks to help.
</P>
<P>
   A standard campaign day involves between one and three public
events, with fund-raisers and strings of short interviews in
between.
</P>
<P>
   He also jogs as often as he can during the breaks, usually while
reporters file the day's stories.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not a workaholic as Al Gore seems to be,'' Buchanan
added. ''He doesn't measure his success by the number of hours he
works, but rather by the results he gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates have historically run for the White House at
different speeds determined by factors as disparate as their
personalities, their duties if they were incumbents, or their
campaign promises.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon, for example, could be considered one of the
busiest candidates. In 1960, he forced himself to dash from one end
of the country to the other after promising to visit all 50 states
before Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton campaigned nearly around the clock in 1992 toward
the end of his victory over Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, he easily beat GOP nominee Bob Dole, who spent
days at a time lounging by the pool at his Florida condominium but
campaigned 96 hours straight in the final days of the contest.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is following Clinton's almost fanatical footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   On just about four hours' sleep and not quite finished with
three weeks' of nonstop campaigning, Gore did a round of early
morning talk shows Monday and pushed through soggy weather into
Hannibal, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't care how hard it rains, I don't care if the lightning
comes down, I'm going to stay here and shake hands with y'all and
talk to you,'' he told voters there.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Drop Anti-Gore Ad  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans, fearing a backlash from a public
weary of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, abruptly dropped plans to air
a television ad questioning Al Gore and President Clinton's
truthfulness.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which had been sent to television stations across the
country, featured a 1994 interview with Gore in which he is
questioned about calling Oliver North a ''pathological liar.'' Gore
is asked whether he and Clinton have always told the truth, and
Gore says they have.
</P>
<P>
   But at the 11th hour, advisers to George W. Bush and at the
Republican National Committee objected to the spot, arguing that it
used an outdated interview and conflicted with the Republican
presidential candidate's promise to stay positive, according to
several senior Republicans familiar with the ad strategy. These
officials spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Outside experts said Bush and the GOP were smart to pull the ad,
which was to begin running as soon as Thursday. The spot was not
only misleading, they said, but was unlikely to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would open Republicans and Bush to the charge that he has
broken his pledge to run a different kind of campaign,'' said
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for
Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns generally don't air personal attacks until the end of
a campaign, and only if they're losing, she said. ''The perception
would be that they're desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad was to have been paid for by the Republican National
Committee, but as the last-minute decision demonstrated, the Bush
camp has a major influence over the RNC's decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The ad featured a television, sitting on a kitchen table,
broadcasting the 1994 NBC interview with Gore. In the midst of
several questions about North, who lied to Congress about arming
the Nicaraguan contras, Gore was asked:
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you say that neither you nor President Clinton has told a
lie in your political career?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore: ''None spring to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Question: ''And President Clinton has not uttered a single
untruth in the last two years?''
</P>
<P>
   Gore: ''Not that I have heard, absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad did not mention the context of the interview or indicate
for viewers what period was covered by ''the last two years.'' The
Lewinsky scandal broke in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was ready to go, awaiting final approval. But at a
meeting Wednesday, officials at Bush's campaign and the RNC
objected. They argued that the ad was misleading, took Gore's
comments out of context and did not present their best argument
that Gore is not credible. Better to use issues, they argued, such
as Gore's shifting views on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans tested the ad in a focus group Tuesday night and
found it ''was not the most effective'' of the GOP's large arsenal
of anti-Gore ads, said two officials who reviewed the test results.
It particularly turned off independent voters and conservative
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And strategists recalled that anti-Clinton ads in the 1998
congressional elections that reminded voters about the Lewinsky
episode backfired on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the momentum against the anti-Gore ad, an attorney
from NBC's standards department phoned the RNC to inform officials
that the network does not allow any of its footage to be used by
political parties, said Barbara Levin, spokeswoman for NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, experts said the ad wasn't smart politics.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think most people see that there's a difference between Bill
Clinton and Al Gore,'' said Bill Benoit, who studies political ads
at the University of Missouri. ''I don't think they're worried that
Gore's going to have an affair and lie about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans may be figuring that out, said Stephen Hess, a
political analyst at the Brookings Institution in Washington. The
Bush campaign, in sharp contrast to the RNC ad, is airing upbeat
spots about education and making tough choices.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either out of instinct or out of focus groups,'' Hess said,
''Republicans have figured out that mainstream America doesn't want
to hear about Monica Lewinsky any more.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Pushes Education Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By BRIGITTE GREENBERG
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore was mixing his vice presidential
duties with his role as a candidate for higher office Thursday,
meeting with Mexico's president-elect before hitting the campaign
trail on behalf of his proposal to make college tuition tax
deductible.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's role as a statesman was being highlighted in the sit-down
with Vincente Fox at the vice president's official residence at the
U.S. Naval Observatory. Fox, who takes office Dec. 1, is expected
to push his proposal to further open the borders separating the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic candidate for president of the United
States, was headed to the University of Maryland after meeting with
Fox to visit with students and university officials and discuss his
proposal to make $10,000 of college tuition tax deductible
annually.
</P>
<P>
   Gore supported the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement
between the United States, Canada and Mexico, but thus far has not
advocated a wholesale opening of the borders. He has pushed for
environmental and labor provisions to protect U.S. jobs under any
future trade pacts.
</P>
<P>
   ''He (Fox) obviously represents a real beginning in Mexico and
we look forward to having a great relationship with him,'' Gore
spokesman Chris Lehane said. ''There's no question that we're in a
global economy where it's good for our economic interests to work
with other countries around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox was meeting separately Thursday with President Clinton and
other administration officials, before meeting with Gore's
Republican rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, in Dallas on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, too, has not advocated opening the borders wholesale, said
spokesman Dan Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush has always supported better enforcement of our
borders to stem the tide of illegal immigration,'' Bartlett said.
He added that Bush supports increasing the number of visas for
foreigners with special skills and has proposed reforming the
Immigration and Naturalization Service so that it plays a less
adversarial role with legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   In Maryland, Gore also was discussing his proposal for tax-free
savings accounts to help families pay for higher education for
their children.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, Gore and running mate Joseph Lieberman were
meeting up in Washington to collect $1.5 million at a pair of
Democratic National Committee dinners.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Debby Hits Haiti  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- Dumping drenching rains that caused
dangerous flooding, Tropical Storm Debby stalked northern Haiti and
forced thousands in Cuba to abandon homes as it pursued an erratic
course that could threaten the Florida Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Centered over northwest Haiti, Debby's winds dwindled from 75
mph Tuesday to 45 mph Wednesday and could weaken further over Cuba,
forecasters said. But they warned the storm could produce battering
waves, flash floods and mudslides -- and even strengthen again if it
reaches the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Keys can expect a tropical storm warning or watch as
early as Thursday morning, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The main concern right now is for the Keys -- not for a
hurricane, but for a tropical storm,'' said Max Mayfield, director
of the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Taking no chances, officials on Wednesday ordered visitors to
evacuate the Keys and shut down all schools.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba evacuated at least 3,000 people, including Haitians at a
refugee camp, from the eastern end of the island. Officials planned
to evacuate thousands more -- including 700 tourists. Debby could
dump up to 15 inches of rain over mountainous areas, and
authorities predicted widespread flooding.
</P>
<P>
   In northern Haiti, shantytown dwellers fled their homes on
Turtle Island and huddled in shelters in driving rain. The storm
flooded homes in Port-de-Paix and ripped tin roofs off shacks.
Haiti's deforested mountains were clearly a worry.
</P>

   ''We're especially afraid of heavy rain washing down from the

   He said high winds sank a boat in the harbor at the nearby
coastal village of Carenage.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Republic's emergency Civil Defense force said more
than 700 people in towns and cities on the north coast were forced
out of their homes by flooding.
</P>
<P>
   At 11 p.m. EDT Wednesday, Debby was centered off the northwest
tip of Haiti over the Windward Passage. It was moving west near 16
mph, headed for Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The storm should be over central Cuba by Thursday afternoon and
then move into the Gulf of Mexico, where it was expected to turn
north, brushing the west coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Debby was downgraded from hurricane status Wednesday when it
lost force in the mountains of Hispaniola. Still, workers in the
Dominican Republic evacuated dozens of people from riverside shacks
and soldiers in the Bahamas deployed to several southern islands
ahead of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   As a minor hurricane on Tuesday, Debby caused little damage to
Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and small northeast Caribbean
islands. On Tuesday, a 78-year-old man died in a suburb of San
Juan, Puerto Rico's capital, when he slipped from his roof while
trying to dismantle an antenna.

<HEADLINE> Bush Seeks To Gain on Tax Cuts  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Seeking the offensive on tax cuts, George
W. Bush was returning to the campaign trail Thursday with renewed
criticism of rival Al Gore's tax-cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican presidential nominee, was also pushing new
funding for historically black colleges and preparing for a speech
on U.S. relations with Latin American countries.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, he acknowledged the need to do a better job
explaining his $1.3 trillion proposal in the face of attacks from
Gore, who has offered a smaller, $500 billion plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll underscore how the vice president's plan carves people
out and denies them tax relief while (Bush's) plan gives help to
the people who need it most,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's two-day trip to Louisiana and Florida includes a double
shot of foreign policy, part of an ongoing effort to prove he has
the knowledge and presence to represent the nation overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Austin, Bush spent much of Wednesday closeted in
the governor's mansion with aides, practicing a speech he is to
deliver Friday in Miami on U.S. relations with Cuba and Mexico, as
well on trade and economic development.
</P>
<P>
   He also meets privately Friday in Dallas with Mexican
president-elect Vincente Fox.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, during a visit to Dillard University in New
Orleans, Bush was to continue his outreach to minorities by
promoting a plan to spend $437 million over five years to help
historically black colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   On tax cuts, public opinion polls have shown little appetite for
a big tax cut while the nation enjoys an economic boom. But Bush
said this week that his proposal for a large, across-the-board
reduction would catch on if he can convince voters that the
government can afford it while at the same time paying off the
debt, funding new programs and rescuing Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   He has long contended that Gore's proposal is too narrowly
targeted.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats continued to hammer away at Bush's plan Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''With all due respect to Governor Bush, the problem isn't
explaining the tax plan, it's the plan itself,'' Gore's running
mate, Sen. Joseph Lieberman said in Florida. ''And the problem is
that it benefits the wealthy not the hard-working families in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bush has several factors working in his favor during
the visit to Louisiana, which last supported a Republican for
president in 1988, when Bush's father was elected.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush is governor of Texas, a neighboring and fellow
oil-producing state, and his counterpart, Louisiana Gov. Mike
Foster, is a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton, former governor of neighboring Arkansas, won
Louisiana in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Bush already has won the support of 20 Democratic members of the
state Legislature -- a symbolic gesture that comports to Bush's
pledge to work with both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ''A pothole doesn't know if you are a Republican or a
Democrat,'' said former House Speaker Hunt Downer. ''That's how we
approach issues in the Legislature and that's how George W. Bush
will approach issues in Washington.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Bounces Back After Convention  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Things have been going well for Al Gore
lately: a big post-convention bounce in the polls, a surge in
support from women and now Attorney General Janet Reno's decision
not to appoint a special counsel to investigate his 1996 fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   It's all put George W. Bush on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   After leading in the polls for five months, the Texas governor
now finds himself in a nearly dead-even race headed toward the
traditional Labor Day kickoff of the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Bush advisers do not expect Gore's surge to persist. And
Gore partisans, too, are cautioning against overoptimism.
</P>
<P>
   A series of polls taken right after the Democratic convention
showed Gore drawing even -- or even taking a slight advantage. Some
of his biggest gains came among women.
</P>
<P>
   The next week or so will be crucial as the numbers settle down,
people in both campaigns say. More often than not, the candidate
ahead on Labor Day wins the election.
</P>
<P>
   As Gore basked in the afterglow of his convention from the deck
of a Mississippi riverboat, the Republican nominee had a ragged few
days of campaigning:
</P>
<P>
   -- Bush's assertion to the Veterans of Foreign Wars that
President Clinton had let the military decline since 1993 was
challenged by both Gore and the only Republican in the Clinton
Cabinet, Defense Secretary William Cohen. Defense budgets actually
started falling in 1986, during the Reagan administration, and the
military last year got the biggest pay raise in a generation.
</P>
<P>
   -- In an unusual admission, Bush told reporters he needed ''to do
a better job'' to defend his $1.3 trillion tax cut proposal against
criticism that it is too costly and favors the wealthy. Caught off
guard by the intensity of the Democratic attack, the Bush campaign
was scrambling to prepare a counteroffensive for Thursday to
criticize Gore's more modest $500 billion, 10-year tax cut plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''He'll underscore how the vice president's plan carves people
out and denies them tax relief while (Bush's) plan gives help to
the people who need it most,'' said Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer.
</P>
<P>
   -- At a fund-raiser in Des Moines, Bush appeared tired and
mangled his words several times, repeating phrases and at one point
saying the nation shouldn't be held ''hostile'' by terrorists or
rogue powers -- when he meant to say ''hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns were working to fine-tune their messages and keep
or regain their footing.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee, with the knowledge of the
Bush campaign, had planned this week to air a biting ad questioning
Gore's veracity.
</P>
<P>
   But the spot was pulled at the last minute Wednesday after
senior Republicans -- including Bush advisers -- raised objections.
</P>
<P>
   The spot, which had been sent to dozens of TV stations in
several states, featured a 1994 Gore interview in which the vice
president said neither he nor Clinton had lied in their public
careers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics inside the GOP's highest ranks called the interview
outdated and questioned whether such a critical ad should run in
the midst of Gore's convention bounce. They also feared it could
backfire if moderate and independent voters thought Republicans
were raising the Monica Lewinsky case again.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore's campaign cautiously welcomed his surge. ''I
don't know what to make of the polls. But it's a fact that Al Gore
has now emerged from the shadows of President Clinton,'' said Mark
Fabiani, Gore's deputy campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   ''The race is even now. The race is right where we want it to
be,'' Fabiani said.
</P>
<P>
   He called Reno's decision ''good news ... but I don't think it
changes the focus'' of Gore's campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Bush took his own message from Reno's decision:
</P>
<P>
   ''While it's clear that Al Gore engaged in a number of
questionable fund-raising activities and gave the FBI statements
that continue to raise the issue of his credibility, the American
people are sick and tired of all these scandals and investigations.
The best way to put all these scandals and investigations behind us
is to elect someone new.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans believe Gore's bounce mostly reflects his
consolidation of support among women.
</P>
<P>
   One senior GOP strategist said private polls viewed by the
campaign showed Bush down over the weekend but up two or three
points in Tuesday's tracking numbers. The official predicted that
Bush would be up three or four points on Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   In one battleground state, Missouri, Bush polls showed him up
two points on Sunday and six on Tuesday, when he campaigned in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Pollster Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center for
the People &AMP; the Press, said, ''Some or all of Gore's bounce will
dissipate. We just don't know how much.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Black, a veteran consultant who advises the Bush
campaign, credits Gore with ''a good speech at the convention and a
good bounce in the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But he had room for a big bounce,'' Black added. ''I don't
think it's with him permanently.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Send Estate Tax Bill To Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican congressional leaders are sending
the White House a bill to repeal estate taxes, inviting another
veto confrontation with President Clinton and setting the stage for
a September veto override attempt in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which would gradually phase out the ''death''
tax over 10 years at a cost of $105 billion, passed the House and
Senate earlier this summer with sizable Democratic support. But
Republican leaders kept the bill tucked away on Capitol Hill,
waiting for an opportune time to send it to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''A veto is a win for big government, high taxes and more
stalemate,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, outlining the difficult spot in which
Democrats could find themselves. ''A signature is a win for
families, small business owners and farmers who are haunted by this
unfair tax.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was set Thursday to be delivered to the White House by
a Montana farmer driving a tractor. House Speaker Dennis Hastert,
R-Ill., also planned an event at a farmer's market in Columbia,
S.C., to highlight the effect estate taxes have on farmers, small
businesses and high-tech entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution, Clinton will have until just after Labor
Day to sign or veto the bill, meaning GOP leaders could hold the
override vote the first week or two after Congress returns from its
summer recess. White House officials said Clinton would certainly
veto it, saying it primarily benefits the wealthy and would consume
$750 billion of projected surpluses during the 10 years after the
tax is fully repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''The more people learn about the dangerous exploding nature of
this tax plan, the less they like it,'' said White House spokesman
Jake Siewert. ''We think you could do more targeted estate tax
relief that takes care of the small businesses and family farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Clinton vetoed another big Republican tax
cut: the 10-year, $292 billion bill that would have eliminated the
income tax penalty paid by millions of married couples. Republicans
are likely to also attempt a veto override on that bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five Democrats joined all Republicans in the House vote to
pass the estate tax repeal bill in June, exceeding the two-thirds
threshold necessary to override a veto. But House Democrats say a
combination of absentees and a handful of switched votes will give
them the margin to sustain the veto.
</P>
<P>
   ''If somebody changes their vote on death tax repeal, it would
be a huge show of inconsistency,'' said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash.
''It should be used by an opponent in that race.''
</P>
<P>
   Heirs of only about 2 percent of all Americans who die each year
are forced to pay estate taxes, mainly because of a $675,000
individual exemption that a married couple can double with simple
planning steps. The exemptions are even higher for farmers and
small businesses, but many are still forced to buy costly insurance
policies and pay lawyers and accountants to protect hard-earned
assets from a tax that reaches 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''In essence, we've been planning for our deaths for about 20
years,'' said Dan McGregor, president of a 325-employee auto parts
manufacturing company in Springfield, Ohio. ''The older we get, the
more onerous the planning is.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long sought to get rid of the ''death'' tax,
but it has only begun to resonate in these recent prosperous times,
notably among blacks and Hispanics who are increasingly building
successful businesses. Republican presidential nominee George W.
Bush advocates repeal of the tax, while Democratic nominee Al Gore
favors simplifying exemptions and raising them for farmers and
small businesses.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jump into Thermal Pool Kills One  </HEADLINE>
By BECKY BOHRER
<TEXT>
<P>
   YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) -- Three young park
concession employees on a late-evening outing plunged into a
178-degree hot spring. One died and two were in critical condition
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The three were burned late Monday in the Cavern Spring, a
10-foot-deep pool in the Lower Geyser Basin, seven miles north of
Old Faithful in the middle of Yellowstone National Park.
</P>
<P>
   ''These three teen-agers jumped into the pool thinking it was
cold water and were amazed to find it was not,'' Dr. Jeff Saffle,
treating the survivors at a Salt Lake City hospital, said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But late Wednesday, park spokeswoman Cheryl Matthews said the
two survivors told first-aid workers that they fell in trying to
jump over what they thought was a small creek after returning from
a swim in the Firehole River.
</P>
<P>
   Yellowstone's thermal pools are often surrounded by thin,
fragile crusts. Numerous warning signs are posted. Visitors to the
Lower Geyser Basin are urged to stay on a half-mile boardwalk over
the treacherous terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would not venture off this boardwalk. You couldn't pay me
enough to set foot off this,'' said Carla Wilson, a visitor from
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Hulphers, 20, of Oroville, Wash., was burned over her
entire body and died a few hours later at the University of Utah's
Intermountain Burn and Trauma Center in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Tyler Montague, 18, of Salt Lake City and Lance Buchi, 18, of
Sandy, Utah, were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Saffle said Montague and Buchi were in shock and barely coherent
after being rescued but told doctors that they dove into the pool
on purpose. He estimated their chances of survival at 30 percent to
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is way too early for us to be optimistic,'' Saffle said.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers don't think alcohol was a factor, park officials said.
Matthews said such accidents are infrequent. In 1998, a man fell
into a thermal pool and suffered second-degree burns.
</P>
<P>
   In Oroville, in north-central Washington, high school teacher
George Thornton remembered Hulphers as ''very outgoing, friendly,
very accepting of others.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She's one of the good kids, really neat, just a treasure of a
kid,'' he said, his voice choking. ''You work very hard as a
teacher, and every once in a while you get a great kid, one you
know will be a great person and a great parent. This is just
tragic. She was a great person.''
</P>
<P>
   The three teens worked in the Old Faithful area, Hulphers and
Buchi in the Old Faithful Inn and Montague at the Old Faithful
Lodge.

<HEADLINE> Group Wants Probe White House E-Mail  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A conservative organization seeking to unearth
thousands of lost White House e-mails is preparing to question a
handful of top current and former Clinton administration officials
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials earlier this year said thousands of
e-mails, including some from Vice President Al Gore's office, were
not properly archived in 1998. As a result, the messages were never
reviewed by White House lawyers to determine whether they should be
turned over under subpoena to investigators in cases ranging from
the Monica Lewinsky scandal and Whitewater to campaign fund
raising.
</P>
<P>
   The computer problems, which White House officials learned of in
June 1998, did not become public until February, in a $90 million
class action suit filed by Judicial Watch, a Washington-based
conservative group that has dogged the administration with several
lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In court on Wednesday, Judicial Watch general counsel Larry
Klayman questioned Mark Lindsay, assistant to the president for
management and administration.
</P>
<P>
   Now Judicial Watch is shooting higher.
</P>
<P>
   The group is asking U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth to
approve court appearances by White House Chief of Staff John
Podesta and White House counsel Charles Ruff. Klayman said the
judge has approved the group's request to question Lindsay's
predecessor, Virginia Apuzzo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are convinced that they were advised of the problem,'' he
said. ''That's why we need to talk to Podesta and Ruff and Apuzzo.
The big guys never were held accountable.''
</P>
<P>
   The group has accused White House officials of dragging their
feet to delay any production of e-mails until after the November
election.
</P>
<P>
   Klayman said Judicial Watch has also asked to depose first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton in the case, but has received no reply.
</P>
<P>
   Klayman has said President Clinton and the first lady, as well
as Gore and his wife, Tipper, wrote e-mail using pseudonyms. The
White House said the Clintons have never done so, but a spokesman
for Gore said he has an e-mail account under a different name for
security purposes. A Gore spokesman was not immediately available,
and it was not immediately clear whether Mrs. Gore had such an
account.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay on Wednesday said the e-mails lost in 1998 were the
victims of a constantly crashing computer system that was
''antiquated and unstable,'' saying the problem was fixed, for the
most part, by a 1999 upgrade performed to head off expected Y2K
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay, 37, also defended himself against accusations that he
threatened White House computer technicians with jail time and the
loss of their jobs if they talked about the case.
</P>
<P>
   His testimony was a virtual reprise of what he told Congress
last spring: that claims he threatened employees were ''absolutely
not true.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said he doesn't recall meeting for more than a few
seconds with Betty Lambuth, the White House contract employee who
made the allegations, and said he never told her to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   In testimony to the House Government Reform Committee last
March, Lindsay acknowledged asking that employees not gossip about
the issue, but said he never threatened anyone.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Lindsay said he told Ruff and Podesta, then the
deputy chief of staff, about the e-mail glitch in June 1998, but
never spoke to Clinton about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lambuth said she and her co-workers dubbed the e-mail problem
''Project X,'' and because of the threats, she and her staff took
to meeting in a park close to the New Executive Office Building and
in a nearby coffee shop when discussing the matter.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the last of its union employees returning to work,
Verizon Communications can now turn to dealing with consumers frustrated by
delayed repairs and unfilled orders for new service. The phone giant estimates
it will take a month to clear 230,000 such requests that piled up over the

Diabetes is closely tied to obesity, and doctors say the higher incidence of the

<HEADLINE> Germ Exposure May Be Good For Kids  </HEADLINE>
By LINDA A. JOHNSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)---- All those colds toddlers pick up in day care may
have a silver lining: Infants exposed to other children and their
germs are less likely to develop asthma later on, researchers
found.
</P>
<P>
   Given the unexplained explosion of asthma and worries that
smaller families and households scrubbed with antibacterial
cleansers may be weakening our immune systems, the finding offers
important clues to researchers seeking to prevent children from
developing the sometimes-fatal respiratory disease.
</P>
<P>
   It also could reassure parents feeling guilty about putting
their infants in day care.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that children who attended day care in their
first six months or had two or more older siblings were about half
as likely to have asthma at age 13 as youngsters who had one or no
older siblings and did not attend day care until they were older.
</P>
<P>
   ''This paper reflects the growing belief that the more sterile
the early environment, the more problems later in life,'' said Dr.
Leonard Bielory, director of the Asthma and Allergy Research Center
at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   According to the hot new ''hygiene theory,'' children who rarely
get outside and get dirty are not being exposed to enough germs to
stimulate proper development of their immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Arizona College of Medicine
have been following about 1,000 children for 15 years, studying
their respiratory health and allergens in their environment. After
previously showing that children in day care get more respiratory
infections than others, the researchers examined more closely the
role of day care and family size.
</P>
<P>
   They found that protection against asthma came from frequent
exposure to other youngsters, but only if the contact took place in
the first six months, a key period for a new immune system.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that if the immune system isn't stimulated early
in life by germs, it begins overreacting to allergy-inducing
substances, said Anne L. Wright, a pediatrics research professor
who led the study.
</P>
<P>
   The children most exposed to other youngsters were about 40
percent more likely than the group with less contact to suffer from
frequent wheezing in their first few years. But doctors believe
that in toddlers, wheezing usually is due to their small airways or
respiratory infections. And wheezing almost always disappears by
age 6 unless the child has asthma.
</P>
<P>
   The new study, funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute, was published Thursday in the New England Journal of
Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma cases jumped 158 percent from 1980 through 1998, with
many of the new cases among children, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma, the most common chronic childhood disease, is an
incurable condition in which allergic reactions to such things as
pollen and dust mites trigger a narrowing of the airways, wheezing
and trouble breathing.
</P>
<P>
   Asthma afflicts some 17 million Americans, including at least 5
million under 18, and kills about 5,400 people annually. While it
is partly inherited, less-understood factors also are at work.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent German studies similarly found asthma less common in
children who started day care early.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marshall Plaut, chief of allergic mechanisms at the National
Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the Arizona
group's study is the strongest evidence of this idea to date.
</P>
<P>
   But he said more research is needed on how children's immune
systems mature, how that affects whether they develop asthma and
whether the apparent benefits of early infections outweigh the
dangers.

<HEADLINE> Condom vending machine sold to California company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A California-based company has agreed to
pay $75 each for seven condom vending machines being sold by the
state of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Impro Corp. of San Jose, was the highest of three bidders. The
company specializes in buying and selling office surplus machine
supplies. Company officials could not be reached for comment
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The used vending machines were from the Rochester Psychiatric
Center, which had installed the dispensers across campus in 1995 to
protect patients from the transmission of diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Seven of the machines were no longer necessary, and the state is
required by law to sell surplus items through a sealed bid process.
The bidding ended Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Although it cost $185 to advertise the sale of the dispensers in
the classified section of Rochester newspaper, state officials have
said the state usually generates revenue on its sales.

<P>
   Bilis arrived in China after killing 11 people in Taiwan.
Although it weakened after making landfall Wednesday in southeast

economic losses totaled $12 million.

<P>
   In Fujian's provincial capital, Fuzhou, most losses were caused
by strong wind. The storm wrecked 845 houses, uprooted more than
4,500 trees and cut electricity to some parts of the city, said a
city flood official surnamed Huang. Huang said economic losses in
the area totaled $60 million.
</P>
<P>
   Gusts of wind smashed windows and advertising boards in Fuzhou
and rain brought the city's transport system to a halt, the China
Daily said. A landslide in northern Fujian destroyed sections of
railway, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   A tornado also struck four villages near Yueqing city in
neighboring Zhejiang province, destroying more than 20 buildings,
damaging more than 130 others and leaving 11 people with slight
injuries, the Beijing Youth Daily said.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities had had time to prepare. The Fujian port of
Xiamen gave city workers Wednesday off as Bilis moved in and Xiamen
ferry services and a local airline shut down operations.
</P>
<P>
   Boats were ordered into port along Fujian's coast, and airports
in Jinjiang, Fuzhou and Xiamen, as well as all Fujian expressways,
were closed until late Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Bilis barreled into Fujian having caused major destruction in
Taiwan, with seven people missing and more than 100 injured after
the storm hit the island late Tuesday with winds of up to 118 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Further south, the death toll from a whirlwind that sank two
tourist boats rose to six Thursday, including an Indian couple and
one Thai, according to police in the northern province of Quang
Ninh. The pilot of one boat was missing and presumed dead.
</P>
<P>
   The whirlwind spun across Halong Bay, 100 miles east of Hanoi,
for half an hour Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The death toll also has risen from tropical storm Kaemi, which
hit seven central provinces over the weekend, with 10 people
killed, officials said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Cambridge Bids For Newton Papers  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Cambridge University is trying to buy an important
collection of papers of alumnus Sir Isaac Newton, saying it fears
the documents might be taken out of the country if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The university already owns most scientific papers of the 17th
century physicist and mathematician credited with setting out the
principles of gravity.
</P>
<P>
   The Earl of Macclesfield has offered to sell the Macclesfield
Collection through auctioneers Sotheby's for $9.4 million -- way
beyond the university's budget. But the national lottery's heritage
fund has pledged $7.2 million, leaving the university to find $2.2
million. On Wednesday, Cambridge appealed to companies, foundations
and trusts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The collection is so important that if nobody comes forward we
might be willing to go into deficit to secure the work -- but that
is a last resort,'' Dr. Patrick Zutshi, keeper of manuscripts at
Cambridge University Library, said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   University librarian Peter Fox warned that if the university
fails to raise the money, ''the danger is that the collection might
go abroad and be split among private collectors, which would be a
tragedy for scholars and a great loss for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's says the Macclesfield Collection, which includes
Newton's earlier writings and ideas on gravitation, calculus,
mathematical principles and optics, is one of the most important
collections of scientific papers in private hands in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Cambridge wants to reunite the papers with the Portsmouth
Collection, the principal archive of Newton's scientific papers,
which was presented to the university by the fifth Earl of
Portsmouth in 1872.
</P>
<P>
   The two collections are closely linked and many of the letters
in the Portsmouth archive have their replies among the documents
held by the Earl of Macclesfield, who supports the university's bid
for his collection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cambridge is clearly the best place for this archive to be
held to ensure its preservation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Eminent Newton fans agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I very much hope we can keep this collection in Britain where
Newton did his work,'' said Stephen Hawking, holder of the Lucasian
chair of mathematics once occupied by Newton, and author of the
acclaimed work, ''A Brief History of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Although much of the work was eventually published, these
papers are important to show how his ideas developed,'' he said.
''Science doesn't appear out of the blue, it's a series of steps.''
</P>
<P>
   Newton studied at Cambridge's Trinity College and was elected
Lucasian Professor in 1669.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous work, the Principia Mathematica, or principles
of mathematics, was published in 1687 and in 1704 he published
Optics, expounding his theories on the effects of light.

<HEADLINE> Stem Cell Guidelines Issued  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL RECER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Anti-abortion groups say new guidelines for
stem cell research violate a law that forbids federal funding of
studies that involve the death or injury of human embryos.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines, announced Wednesday by the National Institutes
of Health, would allow federal funding of research on stem cells
that are removed from human embryos, but forbid research on the
embryo itself.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee said
although the guidelines do not permit the actual killing of the
human embryo, they do encourage research that leads to the death of
embryos.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to kill a human embryo to get (stem cells),'' said
Johnson. He accused the Clinton administration of ''preparing to
violate the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Do No Harm, a coalition of medical ethics experts, said the new
rules ''circumvent'' the 1996 law that prevents embryo use in
research. The law prohibits federal funding of any ''research in
which a human embryo or embryos are destroyed, discarded, or
knowingly subjected to risk of injury or death.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidelines, federal research may be conducted on cells
taken from surplus frozen embryos that are destined to be discarded
by fertility clinics.
</P>
<P>
   Medical researchers vigorously supported the new NIH rules,
saying that federal funding of stem cell research offers the
promise of revolutionary new treatments for a wide variety of human
disorders. A coalition of 25 advocacy groups, ranging from the
American Medical Association to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for
Parkinson's Research, lined up to praise the new guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe stem cells eventually will be used to
strengthen ailing hearts and restore function in diseased brains
and damaged spinal cords. Some believe stem cells can lead to a
cure for diabetes, dramatic new cancer treatments and a
strengthening of damaged or destroyed immune systems and bone
marrow.
</P>
<P>
   ''The full value of (stem cell research) cannot be overstated,''
said Paul Berg, a Stanford University Nobel laureate. ''We believe
that stem cell research will enable us to treat many diseases in a
whole new way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the new guidelines ''will enable research to advance
without violating the ethical sensibilities of the American
people...It would be immoral not to pursue this research within the
bounds of these guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   The stem cells targeted for research form within four days after
conception. The stem cells are part of an inner cell mass within an
embryonic sphere called a blastocyst. Removal of the stem cells
kills the embryo.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells are the predecessors of all the tissues in the body,
such as the heart, brain, skin and bone. Scientists believed these
stem cells can be prompted in the laboratory to grow into the cell
types found in each of the body's organs. Supporters of the
research say stem cells could be used to replace missing or
diseased cells, thus restoring strength and vigor to ailing organs.
Some forecast that the cells may eventually be used to grow whole
new hearts, lungs and livers.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said the stem cells offer ''potentially
staggering benefits'' for a wide variety of medical conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the British government said it would propose allowing
similar research.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. guidelines ensure that there is no financial incentive
to create embryos for research and set up a review board to
consider each research proposal, said Lana Skirboll of NIH.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Pushes Teaching Values  </HEADLINE>
By TOM VERDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) -- Republican vice presidential
nominee Dick Cheney predicted Wednesday that he and George W. Bush
will take California on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an absolutely essential state in this election,''
Cheney told about 70 Republican elected officials and supporters
after flying in for two fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Bush was here last week; I'm here this week,'' he
told the airport gathering. ''We're both going to be back a lot
between now and November 7th because on November 7th we're going to
carry California.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney sounded a family values theme, noting that he and his
wife Lynne will celebrate their 36th wedding anniversary in a few
days.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think that probably the single most important thing we
could do for our grandchildren is to change things in Washington
and bring in a new era of leadership,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney was scheduled to attend a $250-per-person reception for
100 people at a local residence, and a $25,000-per-couple dinner at
a home in the exclusive Hope Ranch area. Ten couples were expected.
The money was going to Republican efforts in California.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, he was in the San Joaquin Valley,
emphasizing that public schools should build character by teaching
traditional values.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing is more essential to education than character,''
Cheney told about 100 students, teachers and parents at Bakersfield
High School. ''We want students to know how to read and write but
also to know right from wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The former defense secretary met with uniformed Junior ROTC
students to praise the values taught in the officer training
program and the military.
</P>
<P>
   It was part of the Republican plan to promote Bush's education
message of accountability and high standards. On Tuesday, Cheney
said education likely will be the most important issue in this
year's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   When the forum was opened to questions from cadets, Cheney chose
the middle ground on issues such as school prayer and gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about reintroducing the Bible and prayer in public
schools, he said he favored a more prominent role for prayer but
said care must be taken to maintain the separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can allow people to express their beliefs -- without
imposing upon others -- religious views that they're uncomfortable
with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the nation needs stricter gun control or tougher
law enforcement, Cheney said he was in favor of prosecuting gun
violators.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 8, Diamondbacks 5  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Mark Loretta and Luis Lopez homered off Curt
Schilling as the Milwaukee Brewers beat Arizona 8-5 Wednesday night
to complete a three-game sweep of the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   Richie Sexson hit his third home run of the series, a two-run,
417-foot shot to center off Byung-Hyun Kim in the eighth, as the
Brewers won their season-high fourth straight.
</P>
<P>
   They had been the only team in the majors not to win more than
three in a row all season.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, winners of seven in a row before being swept
at home, fell 2&AMP;frac12; games behind first-place San Francisco in the NL
West. Danny Bautista drove in two runs for Arizona with a home run
and a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee swept a three-game series for the second time this
season and the second time in its last three series. The Brewers
swept Cincinnati at home before heading out on a six-game road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling (10-8) fell to 4-2 since coming to Arizona, allowing
five runs and seven hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Haynes (11-11) earned his second victory int seven starts,
giving up four runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings. Curtis
Leskanic pitched the ninth for his eighth save in eight chances and
second in as many nights.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee scored three in the fourth to go up 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Marquis Grisson led off with a single, then scored on Geoff
Jenkins' one-out double. After Richie Sexson walked, Charlie Hayes
singled to drive in both runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks narrowed the lead to one three times.
</P>
<P>
   Bautista drove in Steve Finley with a sacrifice fly in the
fourth to cut the lead to 3-2, but Loretta led off the sixth with
his career-high seventh home run to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Matt Williams doubled, then scored on Greg
Colbrunn's one-out single to cut the lead to 4-3. Just the second
home run of the season by Lopez with one out in the seventh boosted
the Brewers' lead to 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's sacrifice fly drove in David Dellucci to make it 5-4
in the seventh, and Bautista's 10th homer of the season cut the
lead to 7-5 in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Todd Stottlemyre, sidelined since June 26 with tendinitis
in his right elbow, threw 60 pitches in his first rehab appearance
for Arizona's Rookie League team in Tucson. Stottlemyre said he had
no pain. He has one more rehab start and is scheduled to return to
the Diamondbacks rotation Sept. 2 or 3. ... Bell extended his
hitting streak to 11 games. The Diamondbacks start a three-game
series in New York Friday. Arizona is 1-5 against the Mets this
season, 0-3 at Shea Stadium. ... Milwaukee hit nine homers in the
three-game series. ... The Brewers are the only team in the majors
that had not won more than three in a row all season.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Looks To Win NEC Invitational  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- No one is quite sure what to make of Tiger
Woods' dominance.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he was challenged in a heart-stopping playoff
in the PGA Championship last week by Bob May, an unheralded player
whose only victory since turning pro 10 years ago came in the
British Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Woods still picked up his third straight major
championship and won for the 16th time in his last 29 tournaments
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   How long he can keep it up?
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as he wants to, really,'' said Darren Clarke, who beat
Woods in the final of the Match Play Championship this year. ''He's
not going to win every one all the time. As well as playing well,
you need that little bit of luck. And sometimes, that doesn't
happen all the time, no matter how good you are.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clarke didn't blink when asked whether Woods was capable of
winning the Grand Slam next year, which would give him seven
straight majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you talk about Tiger, nothing would surprise me,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Bjorn, a distant runner-up to Woods in the British Open,
thinks otherwise, especially after a player with so little major
championship experience nearly beat him at Valhalla Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is by far the best player in the world, and he does things
that nobody else can do,'' Bjorn said. ''He's on a confidence ride
at the moment that is unbelievable, and I think that's what makes
him stand out that much. But this won't keep going. He'll run into
trouble, and he'll start losing tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   This might be as good a week as any. Woods has finished out of
the top 10 only three times this year, and two were in his first
tournament after winning a major. The NEC Invitational, a 37-man
field that begins Thursday at Firestone Country Club, should be a
little different.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Woods is only four days removed from a final
round in which he played his final 15 holes in 8 under, with
birdies on the last two holes to get into a playoff and then one
putt on each of three playoff holes to hold off a spirited
challenge from May.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes at Firestone are high, a $5 million purse in the
World Golf Championship event. And the field is no slouch, despite
Europe changing its rule and eliminating top players such as Jesper
Parnevik and Sergio Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes things a little bit easier to adjust and get your
mind ready and focused to play in a tournament, especially in a
golf course like this,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   The NEC was designed only for Ryder Cup and Presidents Cup team
members, but the European tour decided to send its top 12 from the
money list in the non-Ryder Cup years.
</P>
<P>
   Missing are Parnevik and Garcia, along with teammates Paul
Lawrie, Jean Van de Velde and Jarmo Sandelin. In their places are
Bjorn, Phillip Price, Gary Orr, Paul McGinley and Ian Woosnam.
</P>
<P>
   The latest criticism of the change came from Greg Norman. He's
not affected by European decisions, but it was Norman who first
proposed a world tour in 1994 with hopes of bringing the best
players together more often.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a crying shame,'' Norman said. ''This is a World
Golf Championship. There are players that should be in this
tournament. And I think there's got to be some serious dialogue
behind the scenes to make sure that this never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago in this tournament, Woods had a 62 in the third round
to build a five-stroke lead, then hung on for a one-stroke victory
over Phil Mickelson. It was the springboard toward Woods winning
his last four PGA Tour events of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ''The year is not over yet,'' he said. ''I still would like to
win a few more tournaments this year and play well. I still need to
finish out the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, he is never satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was so drained after his dramatic duel with May that he
stayed home in Florida for an extra day to relax and recharge. That
meant lying on the couch with the television remote in hand, going
to neighbor Mark O'Meara's house for tacos -- and still finding a
little bit of time to figure out what went wrong last week at
Valhalla.
</P>
<P>
   It was a great finish, but not a perfect one.
</P>
<P>
   ''As I said, my two drives were a wonderful 3-wood and driver --
50 yards right and 50 yards left,'' Woods said Wednesday. ''So, I
had to work on a few things. That's going back to my swing plane.
Just trying to get that a little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what everyone else needs.

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Pay Tribute To Dan Marino  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Fans attending the Miami Dolphins' tribute to Dan
Marino cheered Don Shula and jeered Jimmy Johnson. They booed team
owner Wayne Huizenga and had good-natured hoots for Jim Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   The only chanting was reserved for Marino: ''One more year! One
more year!''
</P>
<P>
   ''I would like to play one more year,'' he answered with a
chuckle. ''But I can't.''
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 52,000 gathered Wednesday night at Pro Player
Stadium to hear Shula, John Elway, Terry Bradshaw and others pay
tribute to the most prolific passer in NFL history.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't have a Super Bowl ring,'' Shula said, ''but he's
going to have a Hall of Fame ring.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour program was arranged by the Dolphins after Marino
reluctantly retired in March. The scope of the event reinforced the
reality that his career is over after 17 NFL seasons, all with the
Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's voice broke with emotion as he thanked the fans, while
his wife, Claire, cried.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope you all are having a great time, because I am,'' Marino
said. ''I'll never forget this night.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of knee operations and other leg injuries prompted his
decision to quit. Shula, who coached Marino from 1983 to 1995,
warned that the transition to retirement won't be easy for his
former quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden on Sunday afternoon, there's nothing to do,''
Shula said. ''It's sort of a helpless feeling. There's nothing you
can do to fill the void that's left from doing something so
exciting for so many years.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribute brought together for the first time all six members
of the quarterback class of 1983 -- Marino, Elway, Kelly, Ken
O'Brien, Tony Eason and Todd Blackledge. They're remembered as the
best group of quarterbacks to be drafted in one year.
</P>
<P>
   ''When Danny came in his rookie year and set the world on fire,
he set the bar awful high for the rest of us in the class,'' Elway
said. ''From that point on, we were all chasing Danny.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When he was on the other sideline,'' Kelly said, ''he brought
fear to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd lustily booed each mention of Huizenga. He's still a
target of scorn in South Florida for dismantling the Florida
Marlins' 1997 World Series championship team before selling that
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Fans also booed a video image of Johnson, who feuded with Marino
last season and didn't attend the event. There were mild jeers for
Kelly, whose Buffalo Bills spoiled more than one Dolphins season,
and O'Brien, who engaged in several memorable shootouts against
Marino with the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, it was a night of cheers and a few tears. The
event gave Miami fans a chance to thank Marino -- and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing in one city for 17 years and fulfilling some of the
dreams you had as a kid, being a professional quarterback, wanting
to be successful in front of the fans in Miami, it's a special
relationship,'' he said. ''I feel I'm part of the atmosphere of
this stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 former Dolphins were on hand. There was a
performance by Marino's favorite band, Hootie and the Blowfish, and
he sang backup vocals on ''Mustang Sally'' and ''Long Train
Running.''
</P>
<P>
   The night ended with a fireworks display. Fans paid $2 apiece,
with proceeds going to the Dan Marino Foundation, and many in the
crowd paid tribute to him by wearing a Dolphins jersey with his
number -- 13.
</P>
<P>
   ''The love you show Dan tonight is unprecedented,'' Bradshaw
told the fans. ''Hats off to Miami.''

<HEADLINE> Lasorda Faces Challenge at Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- They're accustomed to playing in places like
Pawtucket, Chattanooga and Akron, so Homebush Bay seems an
appropriate site for the U.S. Olympic baseball players to try to
win a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   With major leaguers and many top farm team players unavailable,
a collection of up-and-coming minor leaguers and journeymen will
represent the United States in the first Olympics to allow pros to
compete in ''America's Pastime.''
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lasorda, the longtime Los Angeles Dodgers manager who's
now an executive with the organization, will manage the U.S. team
in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   His formidable task is to forge a rather ragtag bunch into a
team that can challenge two-time defending Olympic champion Cuba,
plus Japan and Korea, which both will field many of their best pro
players.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, which previously used college players in the
Olympics and has not won a medal since baseball became a full sport
in the Games in 1992, opens the eight-team round robin on Sept. 17
against Japan at Homebush Bay. The gold medal game also will be
played at the stadium, in a Sydney suburb where Olympic Park is
located.
</P>
<P>
   Although 37-year-old Pat Borders was among the few recognizable
names on the U.S. squad announced Wednesday, Lasorda remained the
eternal optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ''We aren't going 6,000 miles to lose,'' the Hall of Fame
manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodgers owner Peter O'Malley believes Lasorda is a
perfect fit for the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tommy will do a gold-medal job,'' O'Malley said. ''He was the
right man for the job. He communicates better than anyone I know.
</P>
<P>
   ''Young players, old players, they're all strangers to him
today. But give him 24 hours, give him one workout, one day with
this team and they'll all be family, they'll all be on the same end
of the rope, and they're going to do their best.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders, a catcher who was the 1992 World Series MVP with
Toronto and is now in the Tampa Bay farm system, is the senior
member of the U.S. squad.
</P>
<P>
   ''He obviously has seen every sort of pitcher. We have a lot of
young pitchers and we think he will be of great help,'' said Bob
Watson, co-chairman with Bill Bavasi of the committee that selected
the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Players on major league rosters weren't available for the
Olympics, and teams also were reluctant to part with some of their
top minor leaguers because they might call them up down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Only 12 players on the current 28-man roster have any major
league experience.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would have liked to have had players like Mark McGwire,
Greg Maddux and Darryl Kile, but this is what was available to
us,'' Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   One more player will be added soon, then the roster will be
trimmed to the final 24 on Sept. 15. The squad will practice for
the first time on Sept. 2 in San Diego before heading for
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The United States qualified for the Olympics by finishing second
to Cuba in the 1999 Pan Am Games.
</P>
<P>
   Gookie Dawkins, an infielder in the Cincinnati organization,
said, ''It's a kid's dream to play for your country against the
best -- Japan, Cuba, the other teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting just .234 for Double-A Chattanooga, Dawkins still was
torn between waiting for a possible major league call-up or playing
in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing against the big leagues -- I want to be there,''
he said. ''Then again, I want to be somewhere where I can play. I
think supporting my country will be good for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he's experienced the Pan Am Games, Dawkins expects some
Olympic teammates to ask him for advice on international
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been there once and I'm sure they're going to have a lot
of questions for me,'' he said. ''It's really a matter of not
putting too much pressure on yourself. Playing for your country is
a big step.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got USA written on your chest.''
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Shawn Gilbert, who has appeared in 15 games for the
Dodgers this year and now is at Triple-A Albuquerque, also played
in the Pan Am Games and knows expectations are high for the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ''The other countries are definitely underrated, as far as their
play. But it's our national pastime, so we're expected to win, in
the eyes of our country,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
   One significant difference between baseball in the United States
and in the Olympics is drug testing. The major leagues conduct no
testing except for players who already have had substance abuse
problems, and there also is no testing in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   The Olympics, by contrast, have a stringent testing program. The
use of some over-the-counter products such as androstenedione, also
known as andro, the muscle-building supplement McGwire made famous,
will disqualify an Olympic athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi doesn't believe the Olympic testing policies deterred any
players under consideration for the U.S. squad, saying that all of
the players were made aware of the Olympics' strict rules.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' pitching staff includes Ryan Franklin, Chris
George, Matt Ginter, Shane Heams, Rick Krivda, Roy Oswalt, Jon
Rauch, C.C. Sabathia, Bobby Seay, Ben Sheets, Todd Williams, Tim
Young and Kurt Ainsworth.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Borders, the catchers are Marcus Jensen and Mike
Kinkade.
</P>
<P>
   The infielders are Brent Abernathy, Sean Burroughs, Brent
Butler, Mike Coolbaugh, Adam Everett, Doug Mientkiewicz and
Dawkins. The outfielders are Gilbert, Anthony Sanders, Ernie Young,
Brad Wilkerson and Mike Neill.
</P>
<P>
   Watson doubts that, unlike the United States' overpowering
Olympic Dream Team of the NBA's finest, the nation will ever
assemble an Olympic baseball team of major league All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see anybody here giving up players to do that. Maybe
if they have the Olympics in the Southern Hemisphere in November,''
he said. ''But if we win the gold medal with these guys, maybe that
won't be an issue.''

<HEADLINE> NTSB: TWA Flight Downed By Fuel Tank  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a four-year, $36 million investigation
the National Transportation Safety Board closed its books on the
crash of TWA Flight 800 and recommended changes in aircraft wiring
and better fuel systems.
</P>
<P>
   The board formally concluded on Wednesday that the Boeing 747
was destroyed by an explosion in its center fuel tank, probably
triggered by a short circuit. It asked the Federal Aviation
Administration to examine aircraft wiring practices, review wiring
design specifications and require improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has 90 days to respond to the recommendations. Board
Chairman Jim Hall said that during the TWA investigation his agency
has sent 11 other recommendations to the FAA, and it has acted or
is taking action on most of them.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation on the cause of the crash off the coast of New
York's Long Island, which killed all 230 aboard, has ranged from
maintenance problems to a bomb, a missile, and even a meteorite. In
a two-day hearing concluding its investigation the board struggled
to disprove those theories.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife, Pam, a former TWA
flight attendant, and his two young daughters, Shannon and Katie,
in the disaster, found little comfort at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presentation by the NTSB has been excellent but there have
been no surprises. The center fuel tank blew up and killed my
family, and the loved ones of the other family members. That is not
supposed to happen, is it?'' Lychner said.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Breistroff from Paris, whose son Michel, 24, had been
about to join the French Olympic hockey team, is not convinced the
plane was brought down by a mechanical problem. He said he had
lingering doubts about a missile or some other non-mechanical
means.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been explaining to me but inside my head I don't
fully believe what they are saying. I wish I could be convinced so
I could be free,'' Breistroff said.
</P>
<P>
   The board spent much of Wednesday afternoon focusing on the
missile theory, stressing that no radar returns show the presence
of a missile.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitness reports generally support the evidence of an internal
explosion, though a few mention a streak of light before the plane
went down.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator David L. Mayer said that the first explosion in the
moving airplane would have looked like a small, moving light
followed, a few seconds later, by a fireball as the plane broke up
and fuel from other tanks went into the blaze. The fireball then
would break up as the pieces fell into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a remarkable consistency of the accounts and most
seem to be describing the breakup of the accident airplane,'' Mayer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses who reported seeing a streak from the ground
didn't include that in their first description, only adding it
later after the idea had been raised in the news, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''Witness statements only help solve the puzzle, physical
evidence is almost always the key,'' said board member John Goglia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday the board raised the question of aging
aircraft. The TWA Flight 800 plane was 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer an airplane is around, the more changes and
modifications it needs,'' said Hall, adding that it is not clear
the industry is paying enough attention to these problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the aviation industry
have launched aging aircraft programs to study the needs of older
planes and how to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Goglia, a former aviation mechanic, stressed that the mere age
of an aircraft does not mean it's not safe. ''A properly maintained
airplane can last forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Swaim of the board's aviation engineering division said,
however, that inspections of a number of commercial aircraft showed
increasing problems as the planes got older.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at other planes from other carriers and other
countries,'' Swaim said. Inspectors found worn insulation, improper
wiring repairs, open splices that should have been sealed and lint
on circuit breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Loeb, the board's aviation safety director, cautioned
that investigators were not saying the problem had reached the
level of planes being unsafe.

<HEADLINE> Trooper Torn Over Casino Duty  </HEADLINE>
By AMY FORLITI
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- As an Indiana State Trooper, Ben Endres
swore to uphold the law. As a leader in his church, he pledged to
set a moral example.
</P>
<P>
   Those two values clashed this year when Endres was assigned to
monitor the blackjack tables and slot machines on a riverboat
casino that cruises a Lake Michigan tributary. When he refused the
duty, citing church doctrine that considers gambling a vice, he was
fired in April.
</P>
<P>
   Endres, a Baptist, has appealed his firing to the Indiana State
Police Board. He has garnered support across Indiana, and his
plight has become a campaign issue in the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   But legal experts say the likelihood of his winning any kind of
appeal are slim. The board has two months to reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are rare cases in which the religious believer has had
the right to trump the general law,'' said Marci Hamilton, an
expert in constitutional law at New York University School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Endres' case could have broader implications, said Scott
Reinacher, chairman of the nonprofit National Troopers' Coalition,
which represents state police organizations in 48 states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nationally, it could have an impact,'' Reinacher said. ''This
is an individual rights issue. He has opted to pay for the exercise
of rights with the loss of his job.''
</P>
<P>
   A state trooper since 1991, Endres, 38, argues he was hired to
defend public safety, not to regulate gambling. While he is willing
to investigate a crime in a casino, he cites a distinction between
enforcing the law and becoming a part of an ''immoral'' activity.
</P>
<P>
   Endres is not alone in putting religious obligations ahead of
his career. Officers across the nation have battled over hair
length, beards, wearing firearms and working religious holidays.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, employers are required to
make reasonable accommodations for religious practices in the
workplace. But police departments don't have to give their officers
special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The right of a person to practice a religion has to be
balanced against the needs of an agency,'' said Wayne Schmidt,
attorney and editor of The Fire and Police Personnel Reporter, a
national legal newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Some religious denominations, such as Orthodox Jewish or
Seventh-day Adventist, require members to observe the Sabbath. Law
enforcement agencies, which require officers to work
round-the-clock, often have trouble accommodating the employee,
Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The one area that people have been winning in religion is in
hairstyle,'' Schmidt said. ''It's very simple to accommodate the
individual by having the individual put their long hair up in the
hat.''
</P>
<P>
   Indiana State Police argues it has tried to accommodate Endres,
a member of an independent Baptist church in South Bend.
</P>
<P>
   He could have sought a transfer or a promotion months before he
was ordered to serve on the casino boat. Once the order was issued,
however, police said it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Exceptions to orders would lead to chaos, and officers cannot
choose which assignments to cover, said State Police Superintendent
Mel Carraway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We cannot, just because we don't like the situation, say we
are not going to report,'' Carraway said.
</P>
<P>
   In Indiana, riverboats cannot leave the dock without a ''gaming
officer'' on board to monitor gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Republican gubernatorial candidate David McIntosh has said that
if elected, he would restore Endres to his job. But Gov. Frank
O'Bannon, who has a comfortable lead in the polls, has said
politics should be kept out of a personnel issue.
</P>
<P>
   Endres, now working as an investigator in the St. Joseph County
prosecutor's office, wants to reclaim the job he loved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to choose to obey the Lord,'' Endres said. ''I feel like
a little guy who tried to do what was right and Goliath kind of
stepped on it.''

<HEADLINE> Japan, N.Korea Stalled in Talks  </HEADLINE>
By GINNY PARKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   KISARAZU, Japan (AP) -- Japan and North Korea made little
progress Thursday in efforts to normalize relations, with talks
stuck on North Korean demands that Japan make amends for its
wartime occupation of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators on both sides spent three hours explaining their
positions on the issue, one of the thorniest in the deep divide
separating the old enemies.
</P>
<P>
   An official from Japan's Foreign Ministry said little new
emerged in the talks, although negotiators were able to get a
''deeper understanding'' of each other's viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   Japan and North Korea have never had diplomatic relations, and
animosity between the nations remains high. Past efforts to
normalize ties have been thwarted by North Korea's demanded that
Japan compensate and apologize for colonizing Korea from 1910-1945.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting in this port town near Tokyo was likely to
focus later in the afternoon on another point of contention:
Japan's claims that North Korea abducted Japanese citizens in the
1970s to use for training spies.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has long denied the allegations. Its delegation
refused this week to meet with Japanese who say their relatives
were among those believed to be kidnapped.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, which began in Tokyo on Tuesday, are the second round
of negotiations begun in Pyongyang four months ago. That meeting
restarted discussions suspended for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Little has been achieved so far, indicating the road toward
reconciliation will be tough, despite communist North Korea's
recent moves to open up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of North and South Korea have held a historic summit
in June, paving the way for families to cross their heavily
militarized border for reunions. The North's foreign minister also
attended a Southeast Asian security conference this year, and
Pyongyang established ties with Italy and the Philippines.

<HEADLINE> Kennedy Library Releases Papers  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE LeBLANC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- Thousands of secret CIA missives and other
previously classified materials, many documenting the internal
foreign policy debate in the Kennedy administration, have been made
public for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Among the documents are memos between President Kennedy and
former National Security Council Adviser McGeorge Bundy, cables
sent from the U.S. Embassy in Laos to the State Department during
the early days of the Vietnam War and efforts at political
subversion in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of historians are expected to scrutinize the 4,500
pages made public Wednesday at the John F. Kennedy Library and
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ''The puzzle of the Kennedy administration is almost complete,
but there are definitely holes,'' said Maura Porter, an archivist
at the library.
</P>
<P>
   The materials, which span Kennedy's years in office from 1960 to
1963, should help give a clearer picture of the administration's
foreign policy decisions, said David Coleman, an assistant
professor at the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   But the historian, who been eagerly anticipating the release of
the documents, cautioned against expecting any stunning
revelations.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman is working on a project to transcribe tapes Kennedy
secretly recorded in the White House. CIA-related documents are
especially valuable because they have been the most difficult to
obtain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Cuba and Vietnam, the files also include
documents concerning the United States' relations with the
Dominican Republic, Germany, India, and the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the so-called ''white papers'' -- in-depth analyses of
countries or individuals -- the more interesting information is
generally contained in the memos, Porter said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To hold a document handwritten by President Kennedy, it makes
history come alive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   One document, a November 1963 message from the CIA to the White
House's ''International Situation Room,'' offers a breathless
account of an assault on the presidential palace in Vietnam:
''Officer who lives adjacent palace area reports all his windows
blown out and small arms fire from all directions on palace.''
</P>
<P>
   Others seem less weighty.
</P>
<P>
   A once-classified memo from October 1963 regarding the
activities of former Vietnamese first lady Madame Nhu reads: ''The
press, digging deep for sidebar stories as Madame Nhu kept to her
hotel room, noted that New York specialty stores appeared to be
trying to touch off a Southeast Asian style motif with Oriental
scenes and fashion advertising featuring her coiffure and almond
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The release of the material is the result, in part, of an
executive order by President Clinton mandating all documents 25
years and older containing national security classified information
be reviewed for declassification.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed in Early Trading  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks open mixed Thursday as investors
continued a recent trend of trading within a very narrow range.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 0.36 at 11,045.01.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Nasdaq composite index
was up 5.39 at 4,016.40, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down
0.03 at 1,505.94, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies
was up 0.14 at 518.02.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the markets will be sector driven for the
foreseeable future in the wake of the Federal Reserve Board's
decision on Tuesday to leave interest rates alone.
</P>
<P>
   A sector driven market means investors won't be following broad
trends, such as the direction of interest rates. Rather, the
markets will move based on events in specific industries.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a slender margin on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.42 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.25 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.24 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.21 percent.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher Thursday as investors have
emerged from the shadow of potential interest rate hikes and into a
sector driven market.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 17.21 at 11,161.86.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.09 at 1,509.06, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 22.61 at 4,033.62.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the markets will be sector driven for the
foreseeable future in the wake of the Federal Reserve Board's
decision on Tuesday to leave interest rates alone.
</P>
<P>
   A sector driven market means that investors won't be following
broad trends, such as the direction of interest rates. Rather, the
markets will move based on events in specific industries.

<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners by on the New

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks fluctuated in and out of positive
territory in morning trading Thursday, apparently seeking a
direction now that the markets have emerged from the shadow of
potential interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   In midmorning trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 3.66 at 11,148.31.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 2.61 at 1,503.36, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 7.85 at 4,018.26.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the Federal Reserve Board's decision on Tuesday
to leave interest rates alone, and the likelihood that rates will
remain stable for the foreseeable future, has left a vacuum in
terms of providing investors with direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a complacent environment. There's not a clearly
defined catalyst for investors to latch onto,'' said Brian Belski,
fundamental market strategist at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, investors will be searching on a daily basis for
some piece of data or news on which to base their trading
decisions, Belski said.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking clear direction Thursday, some investors sought safety
in well known, blue-chip stocks. IBM was up $1 at $124.25, and
General Motors rose $1.375 at $70.313.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers by on the New

slightly below Wednesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Seeks Wiring, Fuel Improvements  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a four-year, $36 million investigation
the National Transportation Safety Board closed its books on the
crash of TWA Flight 800 and recommended changes in aircraft wiring
and better fuel systems.
</P>
<P>
   The board formally concluded on Wednesday that the Boeing 747
was destroyed by an explosion in its center fuel tank, probably
triggered by a short circuit. It asked the Federal Aviation
Administration to examine aircraft wiring practices, review wiring
design specifications and require improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has 90 days to respond to the recommendations. Board
Chairman Jim Hall said that during the TWA investigation his agency
has sent 11 other recommendations to the FAA, and it has acted or
is taking action on most of them.
</P>
<P>
   ''An additional level of safety can be added by looking for ways
to reduce the flammability of fuel tanks themselves,'' said Boeing
spokesman Russ Young. Protecting the fuel tanks from heat is among
options that Boeing, other manufacturers, the FAA and airlines are
looking at, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to continue trying to eliminate any potential
ignition sources within those fuel tanks, which is a long-standing
design philosophy,'' Young said Thursday. ''Those two things
together we think will take what is already a very low risk and
take it even lower.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation on the cause of the crash off the coast of New
York's Long Island, which killed all 230 aboard, has ranged from
maintenance problems to a bomb, a missile, and even a meteorite. In
a two-day hearing concluding its investigation the board struggled
to disprove those theories.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lychner of Houston, who lost his wife, Pam, a former TWA
flight attendant, and his two young daughters, Shannon and Katie,
in the disaster, found little comfort at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The presentation by the NTSB has been excellent but there have
been no surprises. The center fuel tank blew up and killed my
family, and the loved ones of the other family members. That is not
supposed to happen, is it?'' Lychner said.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Breistroff from Paris, whose son Michel, 24, had been
about to join the French Olympic hockey team, is not convinced the
plane was brought down by a mechanical problem. He said he had
lingering doubts about a missile or some other non-mechanical
means.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have been explaining to me but inside my head I don't
fully believe what they are saying. I wish I could be convinced so
I could be free,'' Breistroff said.
</P>
<P>
   The board spent much of Wednesday afternoon focusing on the
missile theory, stressing that no radar returns show the presence
of a missile.
</P>
<P>
   Eyewitness reports generally support the evidence of an internal
explosion, though a few mention a streak of light before the plane
went down.
</P>
<P>
   Investigator David L. Mayer said that the first explosion in the
moving airplane would have looked like a small, moving light
followed, a few seconds later, by a fireball as the plane broke up
and fuel from other tanks went into the blaze. The fireball then
would break up as the pieces fell into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a remarkable consistency of the accounts and most
seem to be describing the breakup of the accident airplane,'' Mayer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses who reported seeing a streak from the ground
didn't include that in their first description, only adding it
later after the idea had been raised in the news, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''Witness statements only help solve the puzzle, physical
evidence is almost always the key,'' said board member John Goglia.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Wednesday the board raised the question of aging
aircraft. The TWA Flight 800 plane was 25 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''The longer an airplane is around, the more changes and
modifications it needs,'' said Hall, adding that it is not clear
the industry is paying enough attention to these problems.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Aviation Administration and the aviation industry
have launched aging aircraft programs to study the needs of older
planes and how to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Goglia, a former aviation mechanic, stressed that the mere age
of an aircraft does not mean it's not safe. ''A properly maintained
airplane can last forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Swaim of the board's aviation engineering division said,
however, that inspections of a number of commercial aircraft showed
increasing problems as the planes got older.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at other planes from other carriers and other
countries,'' Swaim said. Inspectors found worn insulation, improper
wiring repairs, open splices that should have been sealed and lint
on circuit breakers.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Loeb, the board's aviation safety director, cautioned
that investigators were not saying the problem had reached the
level of planes being unsafe.

In molesting case, diocese says liability should be shared
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The Roman Catholic Diocese of Nashville
says that if it is held liable for child abuse committed by a
former priest, other people who knew about the abuse and failed to
report it to the police should share the blame. Those others
include child victims who did not come forward.
</P>
<P>
   Ex-priest Edward McKeown, 56, was sentenced last year to 25
years in prison after admitting he sexually molested two boys since
1995 and an additional 21 boys before then.
</P>
<P>
   The former two, who were abused at ages 11 and 12 and are now
teen-agers, have filed two $35 million lawsuits against McKeown,
the diocese and others.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the diocese has submitted a list of people who knew
that McKeown was an abuser and did not report him, including the
other 21 boys.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials required McKeown to get treatment for
pedophilia in 1986, and forced him from the priesthood in 1989.
Church officials say that its representatives tried to report the
abuse to the state's department of human services and were advised
that no report was necesssary. State officials say they have no
record of such a report.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers who have sued religious institutions for child sex abuse
in other states say they have never seen church attorneys use the
legal doctrine of ''comparative fault'' to try to spread the blame
for abuse by a clergyman or former clergyman.
</P>
<P>
   The diocese, said spokesman Rick Musacchio, ''has merely
responded to the suits brought against us, which required us to
name other people who would have known about possible abuse.''

Group wants white supremacist to stay out of Montana
</P>
<P>
   BOZEMAN, Mont. (AP) -- The Montana Human Rights Network is urging
the leader of the whites-only World Church of the Creator not to
relocate to Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Hale, 29, of Peoria, Ill., is considering settling in
Montana or another state that will allow him to practice law. Hale
passed the bar exam in Illinois, but an Illinois Supreme Court
committee, evaluating ''character and fitness,'' denied him
permission to become a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a possibility I'll be moving to Montana,'' Hale said.
''I'm looking at other states that have more of a First Amendment
way of looking at things.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hale ponders his options, the Human Rights Network is
circulating petitions against a move to Montana.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's the national leader in a hate movement,'' said Ken Toole
of Helena, the network's program director. ''They're the worst of
the bad. This group is consistently associated with violent
behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale said his group has a lot of supporters and ''the vast
majority of them aren't committing any crimes at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Network officials should be taking the opposite approach, Hale
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the Human Rights Network truly believes in human rights,
they should recognize my right to practice my livelihood without
being penalized for what I believe in,'' he said.

Hindus from around the world gather to reflect on their religion
</P>
<P>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- About 1,000 Hindus from New Delhi
to New York gathered in the Caribbean for the World Hindu
Conference 2000 last week to reflect on the religion that unites
them and the diversity of their homelands.
</P>
<P>
   Many western Hindus trace their roots back to laborers who came
to the Caribbean and other regions to work generations ago. In the
conference host country, Trinidad and Tobago, the 1.3 million
population is divided evenly between people of African and Indian
decent, noted Prime Minister Basdeo Panday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest problem facing mankind today is the failure to
manage diversity,'' Panday said at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Within that diversity, Hindus still need to remember their
common bond, participants said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The whole idea is to establish a united Hindu community across
the Indian diaspora,'' said Ganeesh Sierattan, 53, an engineer
living in Margate, Florida. ''There are no more geographical
boundaries, and we're so dispersed, living in 120 countries. Our
ancestors came here as cane cutters; now we're trying to retie that
umbilical cord.''
</P>
<P>
   Sri Ashok Singal, head of the World Hindu Organization, noted an
increasing interest in Hinduism among Indian youth, calling it a
'great renaissance''
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet, imperialism and colonialism are still active and are
creating fissures in Hindu society,'' he warned.

IRS: $560,000 due from pastor accused of 'fleecing the flock'
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (AP) -- Federal investigators have
accused a pastor of hiding his income and using church members'
donations to pay for a lifestyle of fancy cars, Hawaiian vacations
and a mountaintop mansion.
</P>
<P>
   An Internal Revenue Service report alleged Paul Gregory Kiggins,
39, of the nondenominational Tabernacle of Praise church
orchestrated a ''fleecing of the flock'' and owes more than
$560,921 in taxes and penalties from 1995 alone, according to
documents obtained by The Gazette of Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Kiggins, of Woodland Park, confirmed the IRS has been
investigating him for more than three years but said he is the
victim of his ex-wife and others who are trying to block his
attempt to regain custody of the couple's daughters, ages 6, 10 and
16.
</P>
<P>
   He said he is negotiating with the IRS about the audit findings
and declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the IRS has not taken action against Kiggins such as
seizing property. Federal prosecutors declined to comment on
whether they are investigating Kiggins.

Churchgoers in North Carolina protest school prayer ban
</P>
<P>
   ASHEVILLE (AP) -- Thousands of churchgoers from across western
North Carolina filled a high school football stadium to protest
U.S. Supreme Court decisions prohibiting organized prayer in public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers urged the Christians in the stands of A.C. Reynolds
High School's stadium to promote spontaneous prayer at football
games this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to take a stand because we believe prayer in
school is going to make a difference,'' said Carrie Wyatt, who came
to last week's rally with about 30 other members of Sunrise Baptist
Church in Morganton.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the group called We Still Pray want those
attending football games this fall to break into the Lord's Prayer
immediately following the singing of the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   The group also has organized a petition drive urging Congress to
pass legislation seeking a constitutional amendment overturning
court decisions disallowing organized prayer in public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court in June reaffirmed that any prayer in public
schools must be done privately by individual students. By a 6-3
vote, the court barred school officials from letting students lead
stadium crowds in prayer before football games.
</P>
<P>
   The case originated in Texas, where a Catholic and a Mormon
family objected to a policy of elected student representatives
delivering public invocations.

   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 1.20 at 1,504.77, and
the Nasdaq composite index was up 15.22 at 4,026.23.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the Federal Reserve Board's decision Tuesday to
leave interest rates alone, and the likelihood that rates will
remain stable for the foreseeable future, has left a vacuum in
terms of providing investors with direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a complacent environment. There's not a clearly
defined catalyst for investors to latch onto,'' said Brian Belski,
fundamental market strategist at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, investors will be searching on a daily basis for
some piece of data or news on which to base their trading
decisions, Belski said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was held back by a selloff in eyecare company Bausch &AMP;
Lomb, which lowered its outlook for earnings and revenue growth for
the rest of the fiscal year and 2001. In addition, the company
announced that its president and chief operating officer will
resign.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester, N.Y., company's stock fell $19, or 34 percent, to
$36.75.
</P>
<P>
   In economic news, a government report showed durable goods
orders fell by a record 12.4 percent in July, following big gains
in May and June. The figures mean big manufacturers are apparently
tightening their production levels, another sign that the economy
is cooling.
</P>
<P>
   But the report had little obvious impact on the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   So, lacking clear direction, some investors sought safety in
well known, blue-chip stocks. IBM was up $1.438 at $124.688, and
General Motors rose $1.375 at $70.313.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues narrowly outnumbered advancers by on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 374.93 million shares,
slightly below Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 2.81 at 520.69.

<HEADLINE> Daria Stars in Her First TV Film  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- What's with kids today? The attitude. The lip.
The wry, unforgiving, pierce-right-through-it-all world view.
</P>
<P>
   How refreshing! At least, in those who share Daria's prickly
wit.
</P>
<P>
   That's Daria Morgendorffer, teen doyenne of the culturally
disenfranchised. Goddess of the wary sidelong glance. Brainy
rebel-without-a-cause for the '00s.
</P>
<P>
   She has been described as ''a blend of Dorothy Parker, Fran
Lebowitz and Janeane Garofalo, wearing Carrie Donovan's glasses.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, here is Daria's cloaked self-description, which, of course,
she voices in a guarded monotone: ''The only people she liked were
the ones in books, and she spent most of her time in her room,
convinced the world had been quietly taken over by a race of idiot
space aliens.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she stars in her own animated cartoon series on MTV --
a fitting irony, since MTV is way too hip, too cliquish, too
fashion-slavish for Daria to ever be caught watching.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after four seasons suffering high school and all that goes
with it, she has graduated from her weekly show to a feature-length
TV film. Called ''Daria: Is It Fall Yet?,'' it premieres on MTV
this Sunday at 7 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   The premise: What could be worse than a three-month separation
from her institutional nemesis? Yet here she is, sprung from high
school for the summer. And at loose ends.
</P>
<P>
   The Beach Boys-ish opening song outlines her misery: ''Hey,
don't block my shade. Hold the lemonade. And maybe, someone could
turn down the sun!''
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Daria volunteers, so to speak, at the OK to Cry
Corral, a touchy-feely summer camp. Not a good fit.
</P>
<P>
   She has a spat with her best friend, Jane, a painter who seeks
solace at a Beats-like arts colony.
</P>
<P>
   She tries to buck up her popular, brainless sister Quinn, who
not only is in jeopardy of not getting into the right party college
but also fears her popularity is waning.
</P>
<P>
   And she does that thing with her face she almost never does:
Daria smiles. Once. Almost.
</P>
<P>
   What's with this kid?
</P>
<P>
   ''I think our audience relates to Daria because she's smart,
she's direct, she says what people think but often don't say
themselves,'' explains Abby Terkuhle, president of MTV Animation.
''And she's cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Way cool. So cool, in fact, that even viewers woefully beyond
MTV's core demo can relate to Daria and love her new film. And why
not? The man (man!) who created her has a graying beard and kids 11
and 14.
</P>
<P>
   How old is Glenn Eichler? ''Out of the core demo. I think we
should leave it at that, don't you?''
</P>
<P>
   That said (or, rather, not said), he downplays the challenge of
inspiriting a 16-year-old girl in a cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not so big a trick,'' says Eichler, who writes many of
the episodes and co-wrote the movie. ''I think articulate
disaffected people all have a tendency to sound a little bit the
same.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, chatting with Eichler, you find him passingly similar to
Daria: deadpan, a tad sardonic, though with a few years' extra
mileage that assures him Daria is on the right track.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Daria isn't stuck in place. She ages at the rate of
roughly one year to every two years spent on the air (not a bad
plan, unless you're a teen and you're Daria). And she's come a long
way since her first guest shots on ''Beavis and Butt-head.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, she even looked different. Sketchy in every way.
Eichler says he had a hand in her redesign. Though he doesn't draw.
</P>
<P>
   His lack of drawing skill frees him to obsess over certain
things about her appearance. ''When she turns to the side,'' he
notes, ''one eyeglass frame is still all filled with flesh. It's
really disconcerting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighs. More trouble. ''There's a contingent of her fan base
that believes that everything we did after Season One was a
complete betrayal of the character. They want to see Daria continue
to just be detached for 29 minutes and then, in the last minute,
put down all the phonies and win the day.
</P>
<P>
   ''But over 65 episodes, plus the movie, I don't think that makes
for a very realistic depiction of what an adolescent goes
through.''
</P>
<P>
   What will Daria go through in the series' fifth year? ''I don't
know,'' Eichler hedges.
</P>
<P>
   But of COURSE he knows! He's well into production for next
season. Which, even more than before, is likely to reflect his
tenure as the father of precocious kids.
</P>
<P>
   A little world-wearily, Eichler recounts an exchange between his
14-year-old son and pals, observing the world from the back seat of
his car.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're passing some sort of printing company, and one kid says,
'Look: ABC Color.' Then another kid says, 'And yet ... the sign ...
is in black-and-white.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hearing that, Daria might crack a (tiny) smile.

   '20/20': The use of antidepressants has become a widely accepted
treatment for many who suffer from depression and related problems.
But as Dr. Nancy Snyderman reports, people sometimes aren't aware
of the possible side effects accompanying withdrawal from some of
the popular drugs. Several patients tell ''20/20'' of the
immobilizing physical side effects like severe dizziness, electric
shock sensations and nausea that they say prevent them from getting
off the drug. Although experts agree that drugs like Paxil and
Zoloft are effective and beneficial to some patients, Snyderman
asks why patients (and even doctors) seem to be unaware of what
some call devastating side effects of withdrawal. Snyderman's
report will air on ABC News' ''20/20 Friday'' at 10 p.m. EDT.

<HEADLINE> Town Wanted Kelly As Sole Survivor  </HEADLINE>
By KILEY RUSSELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   KERNVILLE, Calif. (AP) -- In Kelly country, a chorus of boos and
hisses followed by a shower of water bottles thrown at the
television greeted the news that she wouldn't be bringing home the
title of ''Survivor'' champion.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Wiglesworth, 23, made it to the final pairing in CBS' hit
TV show and was pitted against Richard Hatch in the final moments.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm so disappointed, but I'm proud of her at the same time,''
said Amanda Szecsei, 25, who works with Kelly as a river guide for
White Water Voyages in Kernville, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly would take home $100,000 for her second-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know she's going to buy a new kayak and new kayak paddle,
things you can't afford on our small river guide salary,'' Szecsei
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wiglesworth, who sat silently through most of the reunion show
that ran after Wednesday's finale, spoke briefly about the rift
between her and one-time ally Susan Hawk. Hawk said her goal in
uniting with Wiglesworth was to boot Hatch off the island, but the
partnership fell apart because of Wiglesworth's indecisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew Sue was going to be bitter,'' Wiglesworth said. ''...
She told me she wasn't going to let me get down to the (final)
three.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two months, Kelly was often described by the media
as ''wishy-washy,'' ''easily manipulated,'' and ''shaky.'' But the
professional whitewater rafting guide from Las Vegas is anything
but, fellow river denizens insist.
</P>
<P>
   ''She goes for it. There's no hesitation and she's not afraid of
anything,'' Szecsei said at the White Water Voyages ranch house,
where about 40 staff and friends of Kelly gathered to watch the
final show Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Szecsei, who accompanied Kelly on a 21-day Colorado River
rafting expedition through the Grand Canyon last year, says Kelly's
ability to inspire the best work from those around her is perhaps
her strongest trait.
</P>
<P>
   ''People love her. Nobody has problem with Kelly,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's co-workers watched the beginning of the season finale
with rapt attention, eating pizza and drinking orange juice as one
person threw a water bottle at the television when Hatch appeared
on screen.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the final episode, Kelly was the only castaway who
never had a vote cast against her.
</P>
<P>
   Richard and Kelly hugged after he was chosen the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, who never finished high school but was still able to
attend the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, is certified in
swift-water rescue, first aid and CPR. Since coming off the island,
she has guided tourists on the twisting Kern River in the Sequoia
National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   She also has an outstanding warrant for her arrest in
Greensboro, N.C. where she allegedly used a stolen credit card to
pay for dinner at The Olive Garden restaurant, according to police.
Greensboro police have said the crime was not serious enough to go
to the expense of extraditing her.
</P>
<P>
   It's her responsibilities as a river guide that most fortified
Kelly for the challenges of life on the world's most Machiavellian
island, said her boss, Bill McGinnis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I sense that Kelly's training and experience as a river guide
was definitely related to the fact that she was the only one who
has gotten no votes on the show,'' McGinnis said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Probes China Arrest Reports  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department is investigating reports
China has arrested 130 members of an underground Christian
evangelical group, including three U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said a U.S. diplomat had been sent
from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing to the area of central China where
a human rights group reported the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly we find the reports deeply disturbing,'' Boucher
said. ''According to the available information so far, the people
arrested have done nothing more than to peacefully practice their
religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Boucher said that was an international right under agreements
approved by China. ''If the arrests are confirmed, we would expect
China to grant us consular access,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The church members were seized in an afternoon raid in Henan
province's Xihua county and have been detained at the county jail,
the Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy reported.
</P>
<P>
   Among those reported arrested were Henry Chu, Patricia Lan and
Sandee Lin, American missionaries who are residents of California,
the Hong Kong-based center reported. The report did not give their
hometowns.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested were members of the Fangcheng church, whose
founder, Zhang Rongliang, was sentenced to two years in a labor
camp in December on charges of leading a cult. Fangcheng church
leaders also were reported arrested last year, prompting members to
appeal to President Clinton to pressure China for their release.
</P>
<P>
   The group is one of scores of clandestine Christian communities,
known as house churches because they are unable to worship in
public. The officially atheistic communist government forbids
worship outside state-sanctioned churches.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher Thursday but seemed
to lack conviction now that the markets have emerged from the

<HEADLINE> Clive Davis Announces New Company  </HEADLINE>
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Just months after his high-profile split from
Arista Records, Clive Davis has formed a new record company with
BMG Entertainment -- the very same conglomerate that declined to
renew his contract at Arista.
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Strauss Zelnick, president and CEO of BMG, announced
Thursday that Davis would head the newly created J Records, a 50-50
joint venture described by both as the largest record company
startup ever created. No financial figures were disclosed, but some
have put the deal's value at about $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an unprecedented, history making venture,'' said
Davis, who created Arista 25 years ago and guided it to become one
of the industry's most successful labels, with a superstar roster
that includes Whitney Houston, Carlos Santana, Sarah McLachlan and
Aretha Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   ''The offer from BMG from every level ... carried the day for
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a recent inductee into the Rock &AMP; Roll Hall of Fame, left
Arista earlier this year after BMG enforced its mandatory
retirement policy of 60; Davis is 67. He was replaced in July by
LaFace Records' founder Antonio ''L.A.'' Reid, a producer in his
own right whose partnership with Kenny ''Babyface'' Edmonds has
yielded hits from multiplatinum acts such as TLC, Toni Braxton and
Usher.
</P>
<P>
   The move came at an odd time: Arista was enjoying one of its
best years due the amazing success of Santana's ''Supernatural,''
which has sold over 13 million copies in the United States alone;
Davis was the album's executive producer. Santana was awarded eight
Grammys, tying a record set by Michael Jackson in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, both Davis and Zelnick took pains to describe their
new relationship in the most positive terms, using terms like
''win-win,'' and ''historic.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've always expressed our strong desire to be in business
with Clive Davis forever, and I'm thrilled that we've achieved
appropriate succession planning at Arista,'' said Zelnick. ''I'm
thrilled, more thrilled, that we're in business with this new
company, which is an instant major.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis bristles at talk that he was ousted from Arista and that
the new deal is some kind of concession.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, this was a contract coming to an end, negotiations
beginning and a prerequisite on my part that I have a substantial
equity interest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's not an element of sour grapes here ... its a ringing
endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   The first release from J Records is expected in October from a
new artist named Olivia. However, other artists from Arista, such
as Next and Deborah Cox, are expected to move to J Records, as well
as ''major artists'' from other record companies. In addition, R&AMP;B
singer Monica will have a joint deal with both companies, and Davis
will still produce for Houston and Santana.
</P>
<P>
   ''We look upon this in the most cooperative light. I'll be
working with Arista in that connection. Everything is being
distributed through BMG, and what has been a uniquely successful
relationship will really go on,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the executives who were part of Davis' team at Arista
will go to J Records (which got its moniker from Davis' middle
name, Jay).
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick also said Davis need not worry about any retirement
policy at J Records.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Davis is firmly in the driver's seat here; We're his
distributor, this is his company. We're thrilled to be in business
with him and he'll set his own policies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time Davis has taken on the challenge of a
startup label. Davis was a former Columbia Records executive who
discovered such acts as Bruce Springsteen and Janis Joplin before
he left and eventually created Arista in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many record executives, Davis played an integral role in
his artists' work, producing much of their material, picking their
songs -- even determining which artists they would collaborate with.
It was those kind of relationships that caused some on his roster
to lobby on Davis' behalf to stay at Arista.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Worried of Aid to Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By STAN LEHMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil is worried that the possible use
of defoliants in Colombia's U.S.-backed plan to combat drug
production could damage its Amazon rain forest, a Foreign Ministry
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental impact of the strategy -- called Plan Colombia
-- was discussed at a Wednesday meeting attended by Foreign Minister
Luiz Felipe Lampreia, Justice Minister Jose Gregori and Defense
Minister Geraldo Quintao.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one involved with Plan Colombia has said that defoliants,
napalm and other chemical agents will be used,'' said the official,
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''But no one is denying their
possible use to destroy coca plantations.''
</P>
<P>
   Colombia is expected to launch the offensive against drug
smugglers soon. On Tuesday, President Clinton signed a waiver that
allows $1.3 billion in aid to be sent to Colombia even though the
country has not met all the human rights conditions set by
Congress. The aid includes 18 Black Hawk helicopters and 42 Huey 2
helicopters, along with money to train and equip Colombia's police
and military.
</P>
<P>
   The possible use of defoliants has Brazilian environmentalists
worried, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be disastrous,'' said Adalberto Verissimo, research
director the environmental organization, Imazon. ''It would
obviously wipe out vegetation and untold numbers of animal
species.''
</P>
<P>
   Brazilian officials said they backed the plan, except for any
foreign military involvement.
</P>
<P>
   The Plan Colombia, which was proposed by Colombian President
Andres Pastrana, also includes financing for programs to reduce
poverty, wean farmers off growing coca and help ongoing peace talks
with powerful leftist guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Also worrying Brazilian officials is the possibility that
Colombian guerillas fleeing the offensive will cross the border or
that drug traffickers will simply shift their cocaine-producing
plantations across the border into Brazil's vast Amazon jungle.
</P>
<P>
   The official would not confirm a report by newspaper Folha de
Sao Paulo over the weekend that Brazil had already begun beefing up
security along its 960-mile border with Colombia.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) -- A boat capsized on the Nile River,
drowning 35 people, mostly school children, the official Sudan News
Agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The children were crossing the Blue Nile, one of the river's
branches, on Wednesday outside Sinja, a town in central Sudan 475
miles south of Khartoum, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   The boat was apparently overloaded with 30 bags of sweet
potatoes and 10 bags of maize, the agency reported.

<P>
   Rescue workers were still looking for bodies more than a day
after the accident. The report did not say if there were any
survivors.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 23; Nasdaq Adds 26  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose modestly Thursday but seemed to lack
conviction now that the markets have emerged from the shadow of
potential interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 23.07 at 11,167.72.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.23 at 1,508.20, and the
Nasdaq composite index was up 25.97 at 4,036.98.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the Federal Reserve Board's decision Tuesday to
leave interest rates alone, and the likelihood that rates will
remain stable for the foreseeable future, has left a vacuum in
terms of providing investors with direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a complacent environment. There's not a clearly
defined catalyst for investors to latch onto,'' said Brian Belski,
fundamental market strategist at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, investors will be searching on a daily basis for
some piece of data or news on which to base their trading
decisions, Belski said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow was held back by a selloff in eyecare company Bausch &AMP;
Lomb, which lowered its outlook for earnings and revenue growth for
the rest of the fiscal year and 2001. In addition, the company
announced that its president and chief operating officer will
resign.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester, N.Y., company's stock fell $20.125, or 36
percent, to $35.625.
</P>
<P>
   In economic news, a government report showed durable goods
orders fell by a record 12.4 percent in July, following big gains
in May and June. The figures mean big manufacturers are apparently
tightening their production levels, another sign that the economy
is cooling.
</P>
<P>
   But the report had little obvious impact on the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   So, lacking clear direction, some investors sought safety in
well known, blue-chip stocks. IBM was up $1.625 at $124.875, and
General Motors rose $2.875 at $71.813.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners by on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 640.09 million shares,
slightly below Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 3.84 at 521.38.

<HEADLINE> Scandal May Topple Guatemala's Rios  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Efrain Rios Montt has never been the
apologetic type.
</P>
<P>
   He served as Guatemala's dictator during the bloodiest era of
one of the world's most brutal civil wars, overseeing a
scorched-earth campaign that saw tens of thousands of mostly Indian
peasants massacred. He followed up his coup-created presidency by
founding Guatemala's ruling party and getting himself elected head
of congress.
</P>
<P>
   But while critics say he got away with murder, polls show that
Rios Montt may not be able to survive a new political storm
involving changes to a proposed 20-percent tax on alcoholic
beverages.
</P>
<P>
   In what newspapers have branded ''Guategate,'' the 20-percent
tax passed by Guatemala's unicameral legislature last month was
published into law as just a 10-percent levy.
</P>
<P>
   Some have accused Rios Montt of illegally changing the law on
his own, something the former general staunchly denies. Rios Montt
and Vice President Franciso Reyes maintain the changes were made by
a Rios Montt-chaired congressional committee assigned to add the
finishing touches to bills already approved by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, tapes of those committee meetings, produced by the
Guatemala City daily Prensa Libre, reveal the changes were not
discussed in committee.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting scandal has eight in 10 Guatemalans believing Rios
Montt compromised the law-and-order platform on which he has built
a seemingly unstoppable political career, solely to pander to
Guatemala's alcohol lobby.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of more than 600 Guatemalans compiled last
week by the independent polling firm Vox Latina, 85 percent of
Guatemalans believe Rios Montt lied about changing the law and then
destroyed evidence to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Another 80 percent of the public believes the former dictator
should step down as president of the Guatemalan legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Rios Montt has said only that he ''did not act illegally.'' But
the poll shows that only about 9 percent of the Guatemalan public
believe him. The survey, published in Prensa Libre, has a margin of
error of four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many were able to forgive a lot of things in Rios Montt for
the credibility he had as a legal and moral leader,'' said Marco
Antonio Barahona, a political analyst for the independent Center of
Social Studies and Research. ''If that goes, he could have very big
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   As a special state prosecutor investigates the matter,
Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo has defended his and Rios
Montt's ruling Guatemalan Republican Front, or FRG, but says he'll
wait to see how the scandal develops around the man he campaigned
alongside during last fall's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important principal of the FRG is to follow the
letter of the law,'' Portillo said Tuesday. ''Whatever the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have raised concerns about whether Guatemala's war-torn
judicial system can successfully investigate the most important man
in Guatemalan politics over the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder if the country's impeachment laws, included in the
1985 constitution but never put to use, will prove effective if
they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The other big question is what Rios Montt will do to defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could see other politicians and leaders stepping forward''
to defend Rios Montt or take the blame, Barahona said. ''The vice
president has already come forward and Rios Montt has a lot more
influence left in him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, another Vox Latina poll released last month found that
35 percent of Guatemalans believe Rios Montt is Guatemala's most
powerful leader. Less than a quarter believe that distinction
belongs to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rios Montt has smugly scoffed at an investigation by Spain's
national court into a criminal complaint charging him and seven
other military and civilian leaders with genocide and
state-directed torture, filed last year by Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Rigoberta Menchu.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the ex-dictator has been largely silent as the
alcohol tax scandal unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a general irony that this relatively small crime may
be the one that brings him down,'' said Paul Siels, legal director
of Guatemala's Center for Human Rights Legal Action, who is
preparing a genocide case against Rios Montt.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day it does remind one a bit of Al Capone
getting tried for tax evasion.''

<HEADLINE> Scandal May Topple Guatemalan  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- Efrain Rios Montt has never been the
apologetic type.
</P>
<P>
   He served as Guatemala's dictator during the bloodiest era of
one of the world's most brutal civil wars, overseeing a
scorched-earth campaign that saw tens of thousands of mostly Indian
peasants massacred. He followed up his coup-created presidency by
founding Guatemala's ruling party and getting himself elected head
of congress.
</P>
<P>
   But while critics say he got away with murder, polls show that
Rios Montt may not be able to survive a new political storm
involving changes to a proposed 20-percent tax on alcoholic
beverages.
</P>
<P>
   In what newspapers have branded ''Guategate,'' the 20-percent
tax passed by Guatemala's unicameral legislature last month was
published into law as just a 10-percent levy.
</P>
<P>
   Some have accused Rios Montt of illegally changing the law on
his own, something the former general staunchly denies. Rios Montt
and Vice President Franciso Reyes maintain the changes were made by
a Rios Montt-chaired congressional committee assigned to add the
finishing touches to bills already approved by lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, tapes of those committee meetings, produced by the
Guatemala City daily Prensa Libre, reveal the changes were not
discussed in committee.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting scandal has eight in 10 Guatemalans believing Rios
Montt compromised the law-and-order platform on which he has built
a seemingly unstoppable political career, solely to pander to
Guatemala's alcohol lobby.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey of more than 600 Guatemalans compiled last
week by the independent polling firm Vox Latina, 85 percent of
Guatemalans believe Rios Montt lied about changing the law and then
destroyed evidence to cover it up.
</P>
<P>
   Another 80 percent of the public believes the former dictator
should step down as president of the Guatemalan legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Rios Montt has said only that he ''did not act illegally.'' But
the poll shows that only about 9 percent of the Guatemalan public
believe him. The survey, published in Prensa Libre, has a margin of
error of four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many were able to forgive a lot of things in Rios Montt for
the credibility he had as a legal and moral leader,'' said Marco
Antonio Barahona, a political analyst for the independent Center of
Social Studies and Research. ''If that goes, he could have very big
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   As a special state prosecutor investigates the matter,
Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo has defended his and Rios
Montt's ruling Guatemalan Republican Front, or FRG, but says he'll
wait to see how the scandal develops around the man he campaigned
alongside during last fall's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The most important principal of the FRG is to follow the
letter of the law,'' Portillo said Tuesday. ''Whatever the
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Many have raised concerns about whether Guatemala's war-torn
judicial system can successfully investigate the most important man
in Guatemalan politics over the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder if the country's impeachment laws, included in the
1985 constitution but never put to use, will prove effective if
they are needed.
</P>
<P>
   The other big question is what Rios Montt will do to defend
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''You could see other politicians and leaders stepping forward''
to defend Rios Montt or take the blame, Barahona said. ''The vice
president has already come forward and Rios Montt has a lot more
influence left in him.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, another Vox Latina poll released last month found that
35 percent of Guatemalans believe Rios Montt is Guatemala's most
powerful leader. Less than a quarter believe that distinction
belongs to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Rios Montt has smugly scoffed at an investigation by Spain's
national court into a criminal complaint charging him and seven
other military and civilian leaders with genocide and
state-directed torture, filed last year by Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Rigoberta Menchu.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the ex-dictator has been largely silent as the
alcohol tax scandal unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a general irony that this relatively small crime may
be the one that brings him down,'' said Paul Siels, legal director
of Guatemala's Center for Human Rights Legal Action, who is
preparing a genocide case against Rios Montt.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day it does remind one a bit of Al Capone
getting tried for tax evasion.''

<HEADLINE> GOP Sends Estate Tax Bill to Clinton  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Taking a bright red tractor Thursday through
the capital's busy streets, Montana rancher Lynn Cornwell sought to
dramatize the estate tax's impact on some farmers and businesses as
he delivered a bill repealing the tax to the White House -- where a
certain veto awaits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The threat of having a tax like this takes away all incentive
of growing your business,'' said Cornwell, a third-generation beef
producer from Glasgow, Mont., who is president-elect of the
National Cattlemen's Beef Association -- a group that long has
lobbied for repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Republican congressional leaders brought in Cornwell, who rode
on a tractor borrowed from a Virginia dealership, to increase
public pressure on President Clinton to sign the bill, which he has
vowed to veto, and set the stage for a September veto override vote
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ''This unfair tax is so steep that sometimes the deceased
owner's children must break up a farm or sell a business just to
cover the tax,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.,
appearing at a farmers' market in Columbia, S.C. ''Your children
should not have to sell what you worked your whole lives to
produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rhetoric, only about 2 percent of all Americans who
die each year are forced to pay estate taxes, mainly because of a
$675,000 individual exemption that a married couple can double with
simple planning steps. The exemptions are even higher for farmers
and small businesses, but many are still forced to buy costly
insurance policies and pay lawyers and accountants to protect
hard-earned assets from a tax that reaches 55 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In Cornwell's state of Montana, for example, only about 5,000
estate tax returns are filed in a given year and only about 150 of
them owe any tax, according to statistics from Sen. Max Baucus,
D-Mont. But Cornwell, who runs a large 100-year-old ranch, said he
spends about $15,000 a year for estate planning to escape the tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to avoid as much estate tax as we can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which passed the House and Senate earlier this
summer with significant Democratic support, would gradually phase
out the tax over 10 years at a cost of $105 billion. Clinton will
have until just after Labor Day to sign or veto the bill, meaning
GOP leaders could hold the House override vote the first week or
two after Congress returns from its summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   Many black and Hispanic Democrats -- among them Tennessee Rep.
Harold Ford, who gave the keynote address at the Democratic
National Convention -- were among the most prominent supporters,
arguing that the tax threatened to undercut minority businesses
that often take several family generations to build.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials left no doubt that Clinton would veto
the bill, saying it primarily benefits the wealthy and would
consume $750 billion of projected surpluses during the 10 years
after the tax is fully repealed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will veto it because we can provide more meaningful,
targeted estate tax relief that provides immediate benefits to
farmers and small businesses and doesn't give away the store,''
said Clinton spokesman Jake Siewert.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats had offered less-costly alternatives backed by Clinton
that would have reduced estate tax rates and increased exemptions
for farmers and small businesses. Democratic presidential nominee
Al Gore advocates a similar approach, while Republican candidate
George W. Bush is calling for complete repeal.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., said one Democratic version would
have offered an immediate $4 million exemption for family farms and
small businesses, effectively eliminating the tax for all but the
wealthiest estates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Republican leaders aren't really interested in getting
anything enacted that benefits the family farmer or small business
owner,'' said Rangel, senior Democrat on the House Ways and Means
Committee. ''All they want is an excuse to hold more political
stunts.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Customs Targets Money Smuggling  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Customs Service has seized more than
$11.4 million in cash that people tried to smuggle out of the
country, including by stuffing it in bicycle tires, cereal boxes
and concealed car compartments.
</P>
<P>
   At least one person attempted to sneak cash out of the country
by tightly rolling $100 bills, inserting them into condoms and
swallowing them.
</P>
<P>
   The seized cash, the result of a six-week nationwide effort
called ''Operation Powerplay,'' was part of a crackdown on money
laundering. The operation led to 194 arrests, including people
wanted for armed robbery and drug possession, Customs said as it
announced the action Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The ''vast majority of the seized money related to the sale of
illegal drugs,'' Customs Commissioner Raymond Kelly told The
Associated Press in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the cash seized was destined for Mexico,
Israel, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala and Jamaica,
Customs said.
</P>
<P>
   Most money laundering involves illicit profits from drug
trafficking, prostitution or other criminal activities, which are
moved through a series of bank or brokerage accounts to make them
appear to be proceeds of legitimate business activity.
</P>
<P>
   Each day, criminal groups generate huge sums of cash from
illegal activities but they face difficulty depositing large
amounts into U.S. banks.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, criminals often smuggle cash to foreign locations
where it can be more easily deposited into banks. Then it can be
instantly wired anywhere, Customs officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Powerplay was ''an integral part of our anti-money
laundering strategy,'' Kelly said. ''We know that bulk-cash
shipments are still the way most drug money leaves the country.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no limit on the amount of money that a person can
legally transport when entering or leaving the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But federal law requires amounts of more than $10,000 (in cash
or in such things as travelers checks, cashiers checks and
securities that can be easily converted to cash) must be reported
to Customs. Those who don't, can have their currency confiscated.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1996 and 1999, Customs has seized $284 million in
unreported currency that people attempted to smuggled out of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the leads generated by Operation Powerplay,
Customs has initiated 173 investigations.
</P>
<P>
   To detect hidden currency, Customs officers used a variety of
methods, including routine searches, X-ray machines to scan large
pieces of cargo and containers, and specially-trained dogs to sniff
out cash.
</P>
<P>
   During the operation, Customs officers -- aided by state and
local law enforcement -- intensified outbound detection efforts
between July 10 and Aug. 19 at airports, seaports, land borders,
mail facilities and courier hubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some seizures resulting from the operation:
</P>
<P>
   --$528,908 from packages at FedEx's express courier hub in
Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   -- $231,340 concealed in bicycle tires at Miami International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   --$21,592 concealed within a Honey Nut Cheerios cereal box
located in trunk of a vehicle searched at Hidalgo, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   -- $504,712 concealed in a secret compartment under the rear seat
of a 1994 Isuzu Trooper.
</P>
<P>
   -- $65,221, some hidden on airline passenger at JFK Airport; 46
pellets containing currency was swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   --$83,546 concealed in a stereo speaker of an airline passenger
at Miami International Airport.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Navy Seals Seek Answers  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA BLIJDENSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- After each dive into the polluted Kishon
River, Israeli navy seal Yuval Tamir spent nearly an hour scrubbing
putrid grime from his skin.
</P>
<P>
   Commanders brushed aside his health concerns and Tamir logged
1,100 hours in the dark waters during a 23-year career -- until he
was diagnosed with skin and colon cancer 18 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Forty divers in the 750-man elite unit have contracted cancer --
and 16 have died -- but the army so far has refused to acknowledge a
link between the diving and the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an independent commission is trying to determine whether
the military knowingly put the men at risk -- and has raised
troubling questions about the military's priorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (commanders) left us wounded in the battle field,''
Tamir, a burly 43-year-old father of two, told the three-judge
panel Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While the army maintains it is cooperating with the inquiry, it
has not addressed the question of exactly when it became aware of
dangerous pollution levels. The army spokesman says training
sessions stopped in 1990, and that since then, only crucial
underwater missions have been carried out, the last one two months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The elite units, including the seals, have always been
considered one of Israel's key weapon against terrorism. Members
are imbued by a sense of mission, even invincibility, and their
training is given top billing.
</P>
<P>
   Veterans of commando units often make a smooth transition into
high-ranking government jobs. Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, are both graduates of Sayeret
Matkal, a crack infantry unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Kishon River and the adjacent Haifa Bay are lined by
chemical companies that have been pouring toxic waste into the
water for decades.
</P>
<P>
   While the Ministry of Environmental Protection pollution levels
have dropped in recent years, the river is still considered a
health hazard, with signs along its banks prohibiting swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Yoram Aviram, a lawyer who represents the navy divers, said it
has been widely known since 1956 that the Kishon was polluted.
Nonetheless, it was the navy's preferred training area for many
years.
</P>
<P>
   Former diver Zvi Stern, 48, who served in the unit from 1970 to
1990, said he and his colleagues sometimes spoke of their fears.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I went into the water, my skin would burn, my eyes
would be red and bulging,'' said Stern, who has undergone 20 skin
cancer operations since 1998 and has had to give up his job as a
caterer.
</P>
<P>
   Stern said that when at one point he refused to dive, he was
locked up at the base for two weeks. In another routine
disciplinary measure, commanders would force divers to drink Kishon
water from their flippers. Tamir said that in 18 months of basic
seals training, divers would have to swallow the brew about 10
times.
</P>
<P>
   Tamir, who toward the end of his career headed an underwater
unit that searches for explosives, said his suspicions grew with
every new report that a comrade had contracted cancer or died of
the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the sick men got together and demanded to be
recognized as wounded veterans, meaning they could draw a monthly
stipend. In response, the army launched an internal probe.
</P>
<P>
   Tamir feared a whitewash and appealed to the Supreme Court.
Before the judges could rule, the state created the independent
commission of inquiry, which began hearing the case this week. It
is headed by retired Chief Justice Meir Shamgar, who in 1996 led
the inquiry into the assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   In Thursday's session, the second so far, the judges heard
testimony from Haifa Mayor Amram Mitzna and Robert Reuveni,
director of the Haifa district office of the Ministry of
Environmental Protection.
</P>
<P>
   Reuveni said the Health Ministry ignored his warnings and did
little to stop the deadly flow of toxic waste into the navy's prime
training location.
</P>
<P>
   Aviram, the divers' lawyer, said each government agency was
trying to find someone else to blame.
</P>
<P>
   The navy veterans said they were deeply pained by the
cat-and-mouse game.
</P>
<P>
   ''All our lives, we were in the military,'' said Stern. ''It
really hurt me when our commander said: 'I dove and I'm not sick.'
He should be thankful that he isn't.'''

<HEADLINE> Plane Carried Egyptian Migrants  </HEADLINE>
By MARIAM FAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- After spending his annual vacation with his
wife and two children in Egypt, Ayman Mohammed Kotb bid them
farewell and boarded a plane to Bahrain to resume his work at a
security company on the island.
</P>
<P>
   He never arrived. Gulf Air Flight 072 crashed into the sea as it
was approaching Bahrain's airport Wednesday, killing all 143 people
on board.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of Egyptians, Ayman flies to the Gulf every
month, escaping Egypt's unemployment to earn a living in the
oil-rich region. Sixty-three of the passengers on the doomed Gulf
Air flight were Egyptian, and many were heading back to work; for
them, the dream of saving to buy a home or business ended in
tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Ayman's wife, Azza Kotb, sat at Cairo airport Thursday, mourning
her husband and waiting for a flight to Bahrain arranged for
relatives of the crash victims.
</P>
<P>
   Among the others waiting to take the special flight was Ahmed
Tolba. He found it hard to believe that he had lost his cousin,
Safinaz Ali Tolba, and her two children, ages 8 and 4.
</P>
<P>
   Safinaz and her children had been flying to Bahrain and then on
to Saudi Arabia, where her Egyptian husband works.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we heard the news on TV, we could not believe it. She was
just with us. We had just dropped her at the airport,'' Ahmed said.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt lacks the oil wealth of the Gulf, and its economy is
struggling to revive from decades of socialist stagnation. It has a
long tradition of sending workers to the Gulf to fill everything
from skilled to menial jobs.
</P>
<P>
   In some Gulf countries like Kuwait, guest workers make up the
majority of the population. The more than 264,000 Egyptians in
Kuwait are the largest Arab community in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptians working abroad usually save money to buy houses and
businesses at home. But they often have to put up with living as
exploited, second-class citizens in the countries where they work.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Egyptians in Bahrain work as dancers and
entertainers in restaurants and clubs. One of those who died on the
plane, Reda Hassan, worked in a Bahraini restaurant. He got married
in Egypt last month and had said goodbye to his wife Wednesday to
go back to his job.
</P>
<P>
   Grief was mixed with anger at Cairo airport Thursday as
relatives complained of a lack of information and even
misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   ''No information is being given to us. Absolutely nothing,''
Mohammed Ibrahim el-Naggar said hours after the crash, waiting for
word of his cousin. ''We were told that there were some survivors,
but no names were given.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, it was announced that there were no survivors.
</P>
<P>
   Women and men screamed and wailed. Some became hysterical and
other were too dazed to express their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   More grief poured out when the special flight arrived in Bahrain
late Thursday. ''I don't want to live ... I don't want to live,''
screamed a woman pushed into the airport on a wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Some 160 relatives flew to Bahrain. There the anguish was only
to intensify: They had to face the agonizing task of identifying
their loved ones -- many badly disfigured by the impact of the crash
-- from photos taken after they were pulled from the sea.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plays Down Rescue Efforts  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- U.S. ships and divers worked side-by-side
with Bahrainis Thursday on the grim task of recovering the 143
bodies from the crash of a Gulf Air flight the day before.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials were careful to play down their role. And
though Bahraini officials expressed their gratitude, state
television all but ignored the U.S. help -- a reflection of how
carefully the United States and its Gulf allies must manage their
ties.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's all about appearances, to be seen to not be playing a
dominant or big brother role in the region,'' said Neil Partrick,
head of the Middle Eastern program at London's Royal United
Services Institute. ''It is a necessary presence, but perhaps a bit
embarrassing for Bahrain because it highlights their dependence on
the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   The USNS Catawba ocean tug was called into action for a second
day Thursday after Bahrain requested help salvaging the scattered
and twisted wreckage, U.S. Navy spokesman Cmdr. Jeff Gradeck said.
The tug and its 10-ton crane ferried divers and hauled chunks of
tortured metal from the 40-foot-deep waters of the debris field.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has close ties to this tiny Gulf nation,
headquarters to the Navy's 5th Fleet. Minutes after the Airbus 320
plunged into the sea Wednesday, the Navy's 226-foot Catawba, four
U.S. helicopters and 10 small U.S. ships joined the nighttime
rescue mission.
</P>
<P>
   After a Bahrain television station showed U.S. divers handing
the Gulf Air's voice recorder to local officials Thursday, the Navy
was modest.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did have divers participating but they were part of a
team,'' Gradeck said.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to specify exactly who discovered the vital evidence
or how the diving team was made up. Nor would he say just how many
U.S. servicemen were participating in the recovery operations or
allow the American searchers to be interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. military has pointed out that Crown Prince Sheik Salman
bin Hamad Al Khalifa was personally directing the search effort,
but the fact remains that much of the hardware has been American.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Catawba and U.S. divers, two small boats from
the USS George Washington helped comb the beachfront, collecting
evidence to determine what killed the downed plane's 143 passengers
and crew.
</P>
<P>
   Bahrain's undersecretary for civil aviation acknowledged U.S.
assistance on Thursday, but only after he was asked point blank by
a reporter. Meanwhile, Bahraini efforts were described in detail.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-American sentiment in the region has never been higher, and
Bahrain can't afford to inflame popular opinion, said Turki
al-Hamad, political analyst for Asharq Al-Awsat, London's daily
Arab newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is sensitivity against anything American, that's the
point,'' said al-Hamad.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the political landscape in the Gulf has changed
since the 1991 U.S.-led Gulf War over the Iraqi invasion of
oil-rich Kuwait. Bahrain, Kuwait and other members of the Gulf
Cooperation Council -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman,
Bahrain and Qatar -- have since established a nucleus of a common
army in a mutual defense pact, and patriotism is high.

<HEADLINE> Trio planned to sell drugs to launder bogus bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - Police say three people accused of
counterfeiting wanted to use the funny money to buy marijuana,
which they planned to resell to get real money.
</P>
<P>
   Arraigned Thursday were Kevin Brunson, 24; Anthony Saya Jr., 21;
and Saya's sister, Janie, 24, all of Baldwinsville.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, police seized at least three personal computers
and printers they say the suspects used to make the fake money, all
$20 bills, said Sgt. Joe Sweeny, a police spokesman. No drugs were
seized.
</P>
<P>
   ''It appears they were just using the money to buy drugs for
recreational use right now,'' Sweeny said.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested the trio Tuesday after being tipped about a drug
deal they were allegedly going to pull off at a known drug house.
Detectives found $1,040 in fake $20 bills inside a car that stopped
outside the house, and arrested the people in the car, Sweeny said.

<HEADLINE> Court generally upholds anti-gambling forces in casino suit  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gambling opponents have legal standing to
challenge a casino compact Gov. George Pataki reached in May 1999
with Mohawk Indians, a state appeals court decided Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous ruling by the five-member Appellate Division of
state Supreme Court restored the court challenges to Pataki's
compact which had been thrown out by state Supreme Court Justice
Joseph Teresi in Albany in March.
</P>
<P>
   In that ruling, Teresi said that since the Mohawks were not
named as defendants in the suit - they are immune from state and
federal suits because they constitute a sovereign nation - the case
could not go forward missing an ''indispensable'' party.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the appeals judges said Teresi's ''harsh'' solution
in a matter involving such ''important and far-reaching issues'' is
not appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   The court said Thursday that even without the Mohawks'
participation, gambling foes could achieve the redress they are
seeking. And, at any rate, the judges said Thursday the state is
backing the Mohawks' interests adequately as it defends the
gambling compact Pataki made with the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   The judges decided that three anti-gambling groups have standing
to challenge the compact: New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms,
the Coalition Against Casino Gambling and the Western New York
Coalition Against Casino Gambling.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, state legislators who were involved in a separate
suit against Pataki's compact - a deal made illegally, they argued,
because the Legislature was not consulted - have legal standing to
bring their complaints. But the appellate division ruled they can
do so as private citizens and not in their capacity as state
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The five judges did find that the Saratoga County Chamber of
Commerce cannot be a plaintiff in the case. The judges said the
chamber's arguments about losing gambling business to Indian
casinos is ''too speculative.'' And provisions in the state
constitution relating to gambling were not designed to protect one
gaming venture against another gaming venture, the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's complex ruling means the case goes back to state
Supreme Court, where Teresi will be asked to decide on what the
gambling opponents consider their core issue - whether Pataki can
make compact agreements with Indian tribes in New York without the
Legislature's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The judges did note in the decision Thursday that reviewing
rulings on the question from other states indicates that courts
have almost always held that state legislatures must be in on the
compact approval process.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel pretty good on that issue given what the appellate
division has said on this one,'' said Cornelius Murray, lawyer for
anti-gambling groups.
</P>
<P>
   As defined by the court's ruling Thursday, the gambling foes can
only challenge Pataki's compact of May 27, 1999. It was an amended
version of a compact former Gov. Mario Cuomo had reached with
Mohawk Indians at the Akwesasne preserve in northern New York in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Pataki agreement allowed the tribe to use 1,000 video slot
machines at its Akwesasne Mohawk Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokeswoman Suzanne Morris said the governor's lawyers
hadn't yet seen the ruling Thursday and that they will ''explore
our options for appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe it is fundamentally unfair to adjudicate the
Indians' rights to gaming in a lawsuit to which they are not a
party,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling opponents were also seeking in their suit to block the
Mohawks from establishing a casino at the site of the former
Monticello Raceway, a harness horse racing track, in the Catskill
Mountains. The Mohawks last October received permission from the
U.S. Department of the Interior to purchase the property and for
that casino to go forward, but Pataki has not moved to ratify that
new gaming operation.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Monticello project has not gone forward - it is under
staunch lobbying opposition from casino operators in Atlantic City,
N.J., who worry it would siphon off their New York City customers -
it is premature for the court to block a development which has not
happened, the appellate division said.
</P>
<P>
   The state legislators and the anti-gambling groups had
challenged the Pataki administration gaming actions in separate
suits which were consolidated into one case by a lower court.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's ruling was written by Justice Thomas Mercure. Others
agreeing with it were Justices Anthony Cardona, D. Bruce Crew III,
Edward Spain and John Lahtinen.

<HEADLINE> Private School for OJ Simpson's Kids  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORAL GABLES, Fla. (AP) -- O.J. Simpson's children have enrolled
in an exclusive South Florida private school and he asked the media
to leave them alone.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the driveway of Gulliver Academy, Simpson said
Thursday he's proud that his 14-year-old daughter, Sydney, and
12-year-old son, Justin, passed the school's rigorous entrance
exams and are beginning classes. They were not present at his news
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The academy charges $13,000 annually, has an average class size
of 14 students and sends almost all of its graduates to college.
The children of Gov. Jeb Bush and singers Julio Iglesias and Gloria
Estefan have attended the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''My major concern was the education of my kids,'' Simpson said.
''The two key things to raising kids is to make sure that they know
they are loved and make sure that they got a first-class
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson, 53, has had custody of his children for four years,
since shortly after he was acquitted of murdering their mother --
his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson -- and her friend Ronald Goldman. A
civil jury later found him responsible for their 1994 deaths,
awarding their families $33.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said he's in the middle of moving from Los Angeles to
South Florida, renting a house for now in an undisclosed location.
He said he is seeking a home near the school.

<HEADLINE> ASPCA and Mary Tyler Moore urge more humane treatment for city carriage horses </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE ROTH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The Manhattan carriage horse, star of romantic
images of city life and ever-popular among tourists, deserves
better.
</P>
<P>
   So say actress Mary Tyler Moore and the American Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty of Animals, who started a massive ad campaign
Thursday to generate support for proposed legislation that they say
would better protect the horses and the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forget your visions of romance and nostalgia,'' said ASPCA
President Larry Hawk, who was joined by Moore on the steps of City
Hall. ''Current city law allows these animals to work and live in
deplorable conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, who keeps nine horses of her own on a farm in upstate New
York, said she hadn't ridden a city horse-drawn carriage since a
scene she did years ago with Dudley Moore in the movie ''Six
Weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a charming scene, but believe me if I had known what
these horses were going through, I would have balked. I would not
have participated in that,'' said Moore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if tourists knew how these horses are treated, they
would not want to ride in a horse-drawn carriage,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A full page ad in The New York Times on Thursday read, ''The
Life of a New York City Carriage Horse is no Walk in the Park.''
Buttons and flyers passed out to pedestrians in downtown Manhattan
echoed the theme.
</P>
<P>
   ''Carriage horses work nine-hour days, seven days a week in 90
degree heat and 18 degree cold,'' Hawk said. ''They're kept
standing for hours at a time under the blazing summer sun, on the
hot asphalt, without shade.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the horses' stalls are too small to allow them to
lie down or turn around.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their stables are in dilapidated buildings with substandard
fire protection and ventilation,'' Hawk said. ''We've seen horses
in this condition collapse, bolt in traffic, and die in freak
accidents.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Moore said they were looking for someone to sponsor the
proposed legislation and called on the City Council and the mayor's
office to endorse restrictions and changes to the current law.
</P>
<P>
   City Council spokesman Jordan Barowitz said, ''The Council is
more than happy to sit down with the ASPCA to work on ways to
improve conditions in the stables for the horses.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the mayor's office, Michael Anton, said ''If and
when a bill comes to us we'll review it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cornelius Patrick Byrne, who for 34 years has owned Central
Park Carriages, said the ASPCA was lying.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have about 10 or 11 drivers and 17 horses. No horses work
more than five days a week and many of them work four. As for the
hours, they're allowed to work nine hours. And of those nine hours,
even on a busy day they're pulling the cab for maybe five hours,''
said Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday through Friday the horses are already restricted to
the Central Park area from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., he said, and ''We
need to be able to go to Midtown and the Theater District after
that to make a living.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes proposed by the ASPCA include licensing for carriage
operators contingent on meeting certain health requirements,
restricting carriages to Central Park, set hours of departure to
and from stables, shaded hack stands and required blanketing of
horses in freezing weather.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, horses are permitted to work in temperatures up to 90
degrees and as low as 18 degrees. The ASPCA's proposal would permit
them to work only in temperatures between 88 and 20 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Hawk said that although carriage horses face similar problems in
a dozen other U.S. cities, the campaign is focusing solely on New
York.

<HEADLINE> New York Senate contest most expensive in the nation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) - New York's Senate race is more than just one
of the most watched Congressional contests in the nation this year,
it's also the most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   A new report by the Center for Responsive Politics found that
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, Rep. Rick Lazio and New York
City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani have raised $49.2 million. Lazio
entered the race in May after Giuliani pulled out following his
diagnosis with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The New York total edges out the race in New Jersey, where Jon
Corzine defeated former New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio in a Democratic
primary and is now facing Rep. Bob Franks, who defeated three GOP
primary challengers. Those candidates raised $48.1 million.
Corzine, a millionaire, is the former chairman of Goldman Sachs.

Election Commission as of Aug. 2.

   DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Tim Reid, who played Venus Flytrap on ''WKRP

</P>
<P>
   Reid's new film, ''Asunder,'' premiered Wednesday night in
Dayton to a soldout audience of about 1,200 as a benefit for the
United Negro College Fund/Wilberforce University Joint Campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, whose movie is a romantic suspense thriller starring Blair
Underwood, said if were it not for historically black colleges such
as Wilberforce, he probably would have ended up in prison. Reid
graduated from Norfolk State University in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm proud to go from at-risk, raw, nothing but arrogance to
someone who was saved by a historical black university,'' Reid
said. ''So this is very important to me tonight.''

<HEADLINE> Settlement reached in uncertified teacher dispute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - State officials and the Board of Education
reached a truce Thursday in their legal battle over the use of
uncertified teachers in the city's poorly performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a settlement of a lawsuit filed by the state, a
Brooklyn judge set a September 2001 deadline for the board to
comply with rules requiring all teachers at the troubled schools be
certified.
</P>
<P>
   Education Commissioner Richard Mills sued the board earlier this
month, alleging it had violated standards adopted by the Board of
Regents in 1999 by hiring hundreds of uncertified teachers to work
at 99 city schools on the state's ''registration review'' list of
poorly performing schools.
</P>
<P>
   Although the schools are expected to begin the upcoming school
year with roughly 350 uncertified teachers, the new agreement
requires officials to steadily reduce that number by filling
vacancies with certified hires.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Mills said the court order reflected ''a clear
recognition that children in the lowest performing schools can,
should and will get certified teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   New York City Schools Chancellor Harold Levy had argued that -
because of a shortage of qualified candidates - Mills should give
the board more time to either reassign uncertified teachers or
certify them through an accelerated certification program.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am most grateful we have reached a settlement,'' Levy said
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Tight race expected in Saratoga feature  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - Heritage of Gold and Beautiful
Pleasure will add another chapter to their continuing battle on
Friday in the 53rd running of the $400,000, Grade I, 1 1/4 mile
Personal Ensign Handicap at Saratoga Race Course.
</P>
<P>
   The last time they met was three weeks ago in the Grade I Go For
Wand Handicap. Heritage of Gold upset Beautiful Pleasure after a
long, uncontested lead on the sloppy surface. Gold won by a length.
</P>
<P>
   There are three other scheduled Personal Ensign starters in what
is expected to be a close race: Back in Shape, Pentatonic and Up We
Go.
</P>
<P>
   In all of her recent starts except in Oaklawn's Apple Blossom,
Beautiful Pleasure has been on the lead early. In the Apple
Blossom, she broke sixth of seven and finished fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're anxious to show that Heritage of Gold is as good on a
fast track as she is on an off track and that she is as good going
a mile-and a-quarter as she is going a mile-and-an-eighth,'' said
Gold's trainer, Tom Amoss.
</P>
<P>
   ''A mile-and-a-quarter may have been a concern for her last
year, but not any longer,'' says Amoss. ''She's got great tactical
speed and she's very athletic out of the gate. She knows how to
save energy. If the pace is hot, she'll sit off it. If it's mild,
then she'll be positioned much closer. She was more relaxed and
more professional last time out than she has ever been.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It all depends what the other horses do out there,'' said
trainer John Ward of Beautiful Pleasure. ''In this race, there's a
long, straight run into the first turn,'' he says. ''A lot can
happen during the early stages of the race.''
</P>
<P>
   From the rail out, the Personal Ensign field is: Back in Shape,
112, Jerry Bailey; Beautiful Pleasure, 124, Jorge Chavez; Heritage
of Gold, 124, Shane Sellers, Pentatonic, 113, Robbie Davis and Up
We Go will have 113 and Pat Day.

<HEADLINE> Putin Raises Military, Police Pay  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin signed a decree Thursday
raising wages by 20 percent for all members of the military,
police, and other security forces beginning Dec. 1, the president's
press service said.
</P>
<P>
   The decree came amid intense public criticism of the navy's --
and Putin's -- handling of a submarine disaster that killed 118
sailors. Relatives of the crew met with Putin Wednesday and
bombarded him with questions about the accident and bleak
conditions in the military.
</P>
<P>
   Putin, a former KGB agent, swept to popularity on promises to
revive the underfunded, disillusioned military and security
services. Pay, housing and food in the armed forces are dismal,
with many servicemen working on the side to support their families.
Police, meanwhile, regularly demand bribes to augment their meager
salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The decree also applies to prison workers, customs officers and
all employees of the Interior Ministry, the press service said.

<HEADLINE> Paramilitary Feud Splits Protestants  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- Some Protestants appealed for
vengeance Thursday, others for an end to the madness as the first
victim of a bloody feud between pro-British paramilitary groups was
laid to rest.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral of Bobby Mahood came just hours after a third victim
was gunned down in front of his girlfriend and infant daughter. Sam
Rocket was apparently killed in retaliation for Monday's slaying of
Mahood and another Protestant militant.
</P>
<P>
   The showdown between the rival Ulster Defense Association and
Ulster Volunteer Force -- two bands of outlaws that operate
side-by-side in the same impoverished Protestant communities --
shows no signs of abating, despite widespread appeals from
politicians and clergy.
</P>
<P>
   John White, a senior representative of the UDA, which provoked
this month's fighting, predicted more killing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The talk within both organizations is for revenge,'' said
White, who helped carry Mahood's flower-draped coffin.
</P>
<P>
   White said his comrades ''feel that they have to murder again to
prevent the UVF murdering any more of our people.''
</P>
<P>
   But UVF representative Billy Hutchinson said his supporters
would not allow their rivals to muscle them out of Protestant
neighborhoods, particularly the Shankill district of west Belfast.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen UVF supporters' homes have been attacked with
bullets, gasoline bombs and bricks since the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll not be driven out of our homes,'' Hutchinson vowed.
''They'll have to kill us all.''
</P>
<P>
   Protestant ministers from several Shankill denominations jointly
appealed Thursday for a mass prayer session, and for the two armed
camps to desist.
</P>
<P>
   ''We ask this for the sake of our community and the people we
love in this community,'' said the Rev. Brian Moore, a Presbyterian
minister. ''We have suffered enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation has been simmering for months, and its roots
go back several years to Northern Ireland's slow-blooming peace
process. It has little to do with political principles and plenty
to do with the lucrative rackets that both operate in competition
with each other.
</P>
<P>
   The gangs share the same overarching goal of keeping Northern
Ireland as a Protestant-majority state linked with Britain. For
more than two decades, both employed the same tactic -- killing
Catholic civilians at random -- as a blunt response to the Irish
Republican Army's own campaign of bombings and shootings.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since the IRA called an open-ended cease-fire in 1994,
the Protestant groups have been deprived a unifying enemy.
</P>
<P>
   After calling their own joint truce, they turned their energies
full time to their long-established rackets: drug trafficking,
cigarette and alcohol smuggling, counterfeiting, video and CD
piracy, and extortion.
</P>
<P>
   A newfound political ambition has also fueled their rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   Both groups sought to emulate the IRA's Sinn Fein party,
launching their own fringe parties and seeking paroles for their
convicted members, a goal achieved in the 1998 peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   But while the UVF's top politicians proved sufficiently
appealing to win seats in a new Northern Ireland legislature, the
UDA's were shut out.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the tensions needed a catalyst for the long-predicted
feud to explode. It came in the form of the UDA's paroled Shankill
commander, Johnny ''Mad Dog'' Adair, who in the past year put the
two paramilitary groups on a collision course.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Adair led a parade up the Shankill Road. As they
passed a UVF-linked pub, their gunmen opened fire on customers,
wounding seven, and launched a spree of attacks on UVF supporters'
homes. The UVF struck back with Monday's killings.
</P>
<P>
   Britain deployed troops into the Shankill district and sent
Adair back to prison indefinitely. But with neither side willing to
back down, ordinary people feel powerless to stop the bloodshed.

<HEADLINE> Accused US Spy Denied Bail in Russia  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW KRAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A Pennsylvania businessman accused of spying and
held in a top security Russian jail was refused bail Thursday,
despite his lawyer's arguments that he may have cancer and needs
specialized medical help.
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Pope, a former U.S. Navy intelligence officer, was
arrested in April on charges of purchasing secret design
information about a high-tech torpedo for tens of thousands of
dollars. His lawyer said Thursday he is accused of buying the plans
from a Russian science professor.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Pavel Astakhov, said Pope denied trying to purchase
documents containing secret information. U.S. State Department
spokesman Richard Boucher said Thursday, ''We've seen no evidence
that Pope has violated any Russian laws.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, judges ruled Pope will remain in Moscow's
Lefortovo jail until a trial in October. The barbed-wire and
concrete complex in a Moscow suburb is reserved for people accused
of espionage or other breaches of national security.
</P>
<P>
   ''The judges decided not to let Mr. Pope free until the main
trial,'' Astakhov said. He said judges will ask a Russian cancer
specialist to visit Pope in jail, and granted a request to allow
Pope to call his parents in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. consular officials were not allowed into Thursday's closed
hearing, Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
   Pope, 54, suffers headaches and dizziness in his jail cell
nearly every day and believes his cancer has returned, Astakhov
said. Pope, originally from Grants Pass, Ore., has a thyroid
disease and previously was treated for bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Astakhov said Lefortovo has no qualified oncologists among its
staff doctors and that the only treatment Pope received was
analgesics for the headaches.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's penal system is stunningly overcrowded and underfunded.
Conditions are generally dismal, with disease rampant and inmates
sometimes sleeping in shifts.
</P>
<P>
   After the hearing, police in flak jackets hustled Pope out of
the Lefortovo Regional Court. He wore a suit and appeared nervous
but walked without difficulty. ''Sorry, I can't comment,'' Pope
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pope faces 20 years in prison if convicted. Astakhov said he
faces one count of procuring state secrets, and previous
accusations of a long-term spying effort were dropped for lack of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Pope worked for the Pennsylvania State University's Applied
Research Laboratory after retiring from the navy. He later founded
CERF Technologies International, a company specializing in studying
foreign maritime equipment. He frequently traveled to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from Penn State said his work there involved
converting technology for commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Agents of the Russian Federal Security Service arrested Pope on
April 3 for allegedly buying plans for a torpedo propulsion system.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., who has helped Pope's family in
the case, has said Pope was only gathering information about a
torpedo that has been advertised commercially.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have described the weapon as an underwater
missile that glides on huge air bubbles it creates as it goes, and
can reach speeds of up to 225 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Astakhov said police have also arrested the man who allegedly
sold Pope the designs. He said the man, a professor at the Bauman
State Technical University in Moscow, will be tried separately.
Nobody answered phones Thursday at the university.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A late buying spree Thursday helped push blue
chip stocks to their highest levels since the spring, but investors
generally seemed to lack conviction now that the markets have
emerged from the shadow of potential interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, after fluctuating in and out
of positive territory for much of the session, closed up 38.09 at
11,182.74, according to preliminary figures.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 2.28 at 1,508.25, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 33.92 at 4,044.93.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the Federal Reserve Board's decision Tuesday to
leave interest rates alone, and the likelihood that rates will
remain stable for the foreseeable future, has left a vacuum in
terms of providing investors with direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a complacent environment. There's not a clearly
defined catalyst for investors to latch onto,'' said Brian Belski,
fundamental market strategist at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, investors will be searching on a daily basis for
some piece of data or news on which to base their trading
decisions, Belski said.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are reluctant to accept the Fed's decision as a
sign that inflation is no longer a concern, a reality that could
serve as an obstacle to the markets returning to their highs of
early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Melcher, president of Balestra Capital Management in New
York, noted that energy costs have skyrocketed this summer and
represent a signficant increase in the cost of living for
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, U.S. labor markets remain tight, Balestra said,
which will keep wages high and help drive consumer prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow might have seen higher gains Thursday if not for a
selloff in eyecare company Bausch &AMP; Lomb, which lowered its outlook
for earnings and revenue growth for the rest of the fiscal year and
2001. In addition, the company announced that its president and
chief operating officer will resign.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester, N.Y., company's stock fell $19.875, or 36
percent, to $35.875.
</P>
<P>
   In economic news, a government report showed durable goods
orders fell by a record 12.4 percent in July, following big gains
in May and June. The figures mean big manufacturers are apparently
tightening their production levels, another sign that the economy
is cooling.
</P>
<P>
   But the report had little obvious impact on the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   So, lacking clear direction, some investors sought safety in
well known, blue-chip stocks. General Motors rose $3.937 at $72.875
and Internet giant America Online gained $2 to $60.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners by on the New
York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 816.78 million shares,
trailing Wednesday's pace.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Trade Accusations  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY GANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- India and Pakistan traded accusations
Thursday after a reported clash in the violent Kashmir region, with
India claiming 10 Pakistani fighters were killed in a failed
assault and Pakistan saying two of its men died fighting off an
Indian attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible to verify either report independently because
of the remoteness of the area. Kashmir, split between Pakistan and
India and claimed by both, is located in the Himalayas. Indian
officials said Thursday's fighting broke out near the disputed
border.
</P>
<P>
   According to Pakistan's state-run news agency, Indian soldiers
launched an assault on a Pakistani military outpost shortly before
dawn but were repulsed. Two Pakistanis were killed, as were several
Indian soldiers, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Pakistani troops deployed on the post displayed exemplary
courage and the enemy was forced to withdraw with heavy
casualties,'' the agency quoted the army as saying.
</P>
<P>
   In India, Maj. Gen. P.P.S. Bindra said 40 Pakistanis launched an
assault in the same area and were repulsed. Ten Pakistanis and one
Indian were killed, Bindra said.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistanis and Indian soldiers who face off along the disputed
Kashmir border routinely exchange fire. It's never clear who is the
first to shoot, but each country routinely accuses the other of
firing first.
</P>
<P>
   The Kashmir dispute between the two nuclear neighbors is decades
old; it has been the cause of two of the three Pakistani-Indian
wars since 1947, when British rule of the subcontinent ended.
Relentless attacks and bitter rhetoric by the leadership of both
countries has the international community worried that the dispute
could be the flashpoint of another all-out war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the two countries exploded nuclear devices and declared
themselves nuclear powers. It's not clear what nuclear weapons they
possess, but both claim to have a minimum nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to bring the two countries to the negotiating table
have failed. India accuses Pakistan of arming and training Muslim
insurgents, who have been waging a bitter secessionist insurgency
in Indian-ruled Kashmir since 1989. Pakistan says it sympathizes
with the militants but does not provide assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a cease-fire by one of the leading guerrilla
groups collapsed after the militants demanded that talks with India
include Pakistan as well. India refused.

<HEADLINE> Senate president proposes $400 million in property tax relief  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A top Republican lawmaker with his eye on
the governor's office wants to hand out $400 million in property
tax relief he says can be paid for with new revenues generated by
the booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Donald T. DiFrancesco, R-Union, proposed
increases to the Homestead Rebate, the NJ Saver program and more
direct state aid to local towns.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the significance of this program - it's without raising
other taxes,'' DiFrancesco said at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most conservative estimates say state revenues will
grow by $1.4 billion next year - more than enough to fund his
program, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't be proposing it if we didn't feel comfortable with
the revenue projections,'' DiFrancesco said. ''This is very safe.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco said his plan would raise the Homestead Rebate for
the first time in 10 years, giving senior citizens and disabled
residents $750, up from $500.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also would double the NJ Saver rebate, to an
average of $500 next year. The program would be fully funded by
2002, a year ahead of the current plan.
</P>
<P>
   And DiFrancesco wants to put $100 million over three years into
grants for direct municipal property tax relief
</P>
<P>
   ''When things are going well, you should try to return more
money to your taxpayers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the plan must be included in Gov. Christie Whitman's
next budget proposal and eventually be approved by both the Senate
and the Assembly. In a statement, Whitman said she would discuss it
with DiFrancesco.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, said he is ''supportive
of property tax initiatives whenever we can afford them.''
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco and Collins have often sparred over legislation,
most recently battling over details in the Transportation Trust
Fund renewal and the school construction bill ordered by the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Collins is often mentioned as DiFrancesco's likely Republican
primary opponent next year. Whitman is barred from seeking a third
term.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats should also be pleased, since many have urged
improvements in the NJ Saver program, DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joseph S. Suliga, D-Union, called the plan nothing
more than an updated version of former Democratic initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''This proposal stacks up as something old and something
borrowed that is packaged to look like something new,'' he said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In next year's budget, DiFrancesco wants $125 million for the
rebate increases, $242 million for the NJ Saver portion and $33
million for municipal aid. The remainder would come in the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   He was joined at his Statehouse news conference by three
Republican state senators and two county executives, who thanked
him for showing leadership on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   DiFrancesco repeatedly denied his proposal was timed to any
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it happens to be an election year, I'm sorry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He has made no formal announcement that he is running for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can tell you I am seriously, seriously considering
running,'' he said. ''If I wasn't thinking about running for
governor, I'd be doing the same thing.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denies Smuggling Accusation  </HEADLINE>
By JAMAL HALA
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan on Thursday denied Peru's accusation
that it was involved in smuggling arms to Colombian guerrillas,
saying the weapons were legally sold to the Peruvian government two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute began Monday when Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori's security adviser Vladimiro Montesinos said Jordanian
arms had reached Colombian guerrillas. He said a low-ranking
Peruvian officer and former soldier had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Jordanian government official said in an interview
Thursday that the arms were sold in 1998 through legal channels and
that Jordan was willing to show Peruvian government officials all
the documents pertaining to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   The arms had been used by the Jordanian armed forces, said the
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He declined to
provide other details.
</P>
<P>
   A report by the official Petra news agency speculated that
Peruvian military officials had funneled the arms to Colombian
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   In Lima on Thursday, a spokesman for Peru's Defense Ministry,
Commander Angel Domenack, declined to respond to the assertion that
Peru purchased the weapons legally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president of the republic was explicit about this
yesterday. He provided all the information,'' Domenack told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori denied Wednesday that Peru's armed forces were involved
in weapons trafficking. He said Peru had lodged an official letter
of complaint with Jordanian diplomatic officials in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's security chief, Montesinos, said Monday that the
Jordanian arms shipments hopscotched from the Canary Islands to
Guyana and finally to Peru's northern Amazon city of Iquitos,
passing over southern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,000 weapons were dropped by parachute to the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, Montesinos said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Montesinos was the first time in a decade
the reclusive security adviser had spoken publicly at news
conference. He appeared with Fujimori at the session.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 10 years, Montesinos has used the National
Intelligence Service to help Fujimori maintain his authoritarian
grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's critics say Montesinos has used Peru's intelligence
network to illegally infiltrate all branches of government on
Fujimori's behalf, and undercut political opposition with coercion,
bribes, and dirty tricks
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, who has faced pressure at home and abroad to fire
Montesinos, said the arms ring was uncovered by an intelligence
service investigation that began in late 1998.

<HEADLINE> US: Colombia Aid a Tool for Drug War  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. military aid to Colombia is intended to
strengthen President Andres Pastrana's anti-drug campaign, not
fight the Andean nation's guerrilla insurgency, a senior White
House official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're talking about a few hundred American people going to
train some Colombian army battalions, ... who will have a greater
capability to provide security for the Colombian national police
when they go in to try to destroy (drug) crops,'' said Sandy
Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Berger rejected any parallel to the early years of U.S. military
involvement in Vietnam, in which the provision of modest numbers of
military advisers led eventually to a massive and costly infusion
of combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact is, this is nothing similar whatsoever,'' Berger
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will visit Colombia on Wednesday to demonstrate American
support for Pastrana's $7.5 billion anti-drug plan. Clinton will
tour the port of Cartagena, get a briefing on drug interdiction
efforts, and meet members of the Colombian national police, Berger
said. In a meeting with Pastrana, Clinton will be joined by a
bipartisan congressional delegation to include House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a taped television address by Clinton will be
broadcast in Colombia, Berger said. It will express U.S. support
for Pastrana's anti-drug and peace proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Clinton was going to Cartagena instead of Bogota, the
capital, Berger said the decision was influenced in part by
security concerns. Colombia is one of the world's most violent
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Berger defended Clinton's decision Tuesday to sign a national
security waiver exempting the Colombian military from human rights
standards that were set by the U.S. Congress as a condition of
approval for a $1.3 billion aid package.
</P>
<P>
   ''There just has not been time, even though President Pastrana
has been deeply committed to human rights, to meet the performance
requirements of a law that just passed two months ago,'' Berger
said. He credited Pastrana with firing generals and suspending
others accused of human rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ''So I don't think that we have to hold our nose'' in exempting
the Colombian military and providing the $1.3 billion, Berger said.
Portions of the aid are directed at economic and human rights
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have complained that by waiving some of the
conditions for U.S. aid, Clinton sent a message that fighting drugs
was more important than stopping the murders, torture and
disappearances of noncombatants by the Colombian military and their
right-wing paramilitary allies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. aid includes the provision of U.S. military trainers
for Colombian army anti-drug units. No more than 500 U.S. soldiers
and 300 contract employees can be in Colombia at one time, and they
are barred from going into combat. There already are about 100 U.S.
soldiers in Colombia, including members of the Army's 7th Special
Forces Group from Fort Bragg, N.C., and an Air Force unit from
Hurlbert Field, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, a strong supporter of Colombian aid, issued a statement
Thursday applauding Clinton's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''This aid will help in the Colombian government's fight against
illegal narcotics and keep these drugs from reaching our shores,''
Hastert said. ''That was the easy part. Now we must focus our
energies on properly implementing these policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton views Colombia's anti-drug campaign as a key
to the survival of democracy in that country.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very hard to imagine democracy surviving over the long
term in Colombia, unless there can be both some reversal in the
grip of the drug traffickers and be a peace with the insurgents,''
he said, adding that the government must negotiate a settlement
with the guerrillas and not expect to win a military victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't think there is a military solution to the guerrilla
war in Colombia, nor does President Pastrana,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Colombian teen tangled in bureaucratic mess, can't go to school  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORTH SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A foreign-exchange student agency
should pay tuition for a Colombian girl who has been turned down
for enrollment by the high school she planned to attend, says a
state lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   AFS Intercultural Programs arranged for foreign-exchange student
Susana Nigrinis, 17, of Colombia to live with a family in Cicero,
N.Y., just north of Syracuse. Nigrinis hoped to enroll at
Cicero-North Syracuse High School.
</P>
<P>
   But school officials said this week the district had reached its
five-student limit on the number of foreign-exchange students it
accepts before AFS contacted the district.
</P>
<P>
   The problem surfaced after Nigrinis arrived here in early
August.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Michael Bragman blamed AFS, formerly known as
American Field Service, for sending Nigrinis from Colombia without
first ensuring a place for her at the school. Bragman sent a letter
Wednesday to AFS asking it to pay tuition so Nigrinis can attend
Cicero-North Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   The nonresident tuition rate last year was $3,793. A new rate
will be set for this year. The five foreign-exchange students
accepted by the school don't pay tuition, said School
Superintendent Jerome Melvin.
</P>
<P>
   The school board would have to decide whether Nigrinis could
attend Cicero-North Syracuse if AFS paid tuition. But, Melvin said
he would recommend that the board approve her attendance if AFS
agreed to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Zausmer, Nigrinis' host parent, said the family planned
to ask the school board to make an exception for Nigrinis because
of the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Vogel, AFS vice president for marketing and
communication, said AFS was trying to resolve the problem with the
school district. She would not say whether AFS would pay tuition
for Nigrinis.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of factors,'' Vogel said.
</P>
<P>
   Vogel said AFS believes it followed the correct procedures.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Africa Trip Is Symbolic  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's weekend trip to Africa
will take him to opposite sides of the continent as he offers
encouragement to Nigeria's democracy and assesses what may be the
collapse of peace efforts among Burundi's warring factions.
</P>
<P>
   The trip is Clinton's second to sub-Saharan Africa and likely
his last as president. Although brief, it is weighted with
symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton last visited the continent in 1998, he made a point
of flying right over Nigeria, Africa's most populous country and a
regional power in western Africa, to protest the corrupt and brutal
military regime then in power. This time, he will make joint
appearances with the new civilian leader, President Olesegun
Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The visit to Nigeria signals our strong support for the most
important democratic transition in Africa since the collapse of
apartheid and underscores the opportunities opened by Nigeria's
shift from pariah to partner,'' White House National Security
Adviser Sandy Berger said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also plans a one-day stop in Tanzania, on the eastern
coast, where former South African President Nelson Mandela is
trying to broker an end to ethnic warfare between Hutus and Tutsis
in neighboring Burundi.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela has been mediating peace talks since December and
invited Clinton and other world leaders to witness the signing of a
peace accord in Arusha, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had hoped the visit would be as cheery as
Clinton's Nigeria stop -- a chance to bless Mandela's work and to
put his imprimatur on the long process of ending horrific ethnic
fighting in eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, in Rwanda, more than 500,000 Tutsis were killed
in massacres orchestrated by Rwanda's extremist Hutu government.
</P>
<P>
   But Tutsi leaders have balked at signing a power-sharing accord
by the Monday deadline set by Mandela and it is not clear whether
there will be any peace signing.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Clinton will go to Arusha anyway to show
solidarity with Mandela's efforts.
</P>
<P>
   During two days in Nigeria, Clinton will congratulate Obasanjo
for his efforts at reform and encourage Obasanjo to do more. The
White House said Clinton will discuss ways to improve the
efficiency of Nigerian oil production and ways to ease the
inequities in a nation with vast natural resources and some of the
world's poorest people.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are critical issues that go beyond political reform and
even economic reform towards the issues that are confronting
Nigeria and the continent,'' White House Chief of Staff John
Podesta said. Among those is the threat of infectious diseases such
as AIDS, which kills 6,000 people a day in Africa and has orphaned
some 15 percent of children in the worst-affected cities.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton may also propose a write-off of some of Nigeria's
foreign debt but he would need congressional approval for any U.S.
debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   After a joint news conference with Obasanjo on Saturday, Clinton
will meet with regional leaders and then address the Nigerian
legislature. Later, he plans a visit to a women's development
center and meetings with U.S. and Nigerian business executives.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not scheduled to meet with human rights activists
critical of Obasanjo's 15-month-old regime, although Berger said
Clinton will raise the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo has sent mixed signals on human rights and corruption.
He ordered his military to raze a restive town in the oil-producing
delta, and after an initial hard push against government
corruption, some of his own aides have reverted to the old
economics of influence peddling and inside deals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the abuse of government over ... 30 of the last 40 years
in Nigeria, the thievery, the thuggery, the divisiveness, that has
been fostered by government, he inherits a pretty tough
situation,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will also address a constitutional crisis in Nigeria,
where several northern states have imposed strict Islamic law,
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House scrapped plans for stops either in the
Muslim-dominated North or the Christian-dominated oil-producing
regions in the South because of political sensitivities. Clinton's
short schedule would not allow for two stops -- and the Clinton
administration eventually decided not to slight leaders of either
region.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton will confine himself to the relatively
antiseptic political capital of Abuja in the less-populated center
of the country. He does plan a short side visit to a village about
a half-hour from Abuja, but still far from the opposing seats of
religious influence.

<HEADLINE> Report: Kohl Involved in Scandal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- A newspaper report alleges former German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl was more deeply involved in his party's
financial scandal than he has admitted, quoting sources as saying
he personally initiated the setting up of secret bank accounts soon
after he took office.
</P>
<P>
   The longtime leader both of Germany and the conservative
Christian Democrats allegedly directed the transfer in 1982 of $2.4
million from his party's parliamentary faction to the party itself,
according to a report to appear in the Sueddeutsche Zeitung on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified ''reliable sources,'' said
the money went through a middleman to a then-party treasury
official, Uwe Luethje, and was hidden in trustee accounts by
ex-party financial adviser Horst Weyrauch.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl denied the newspaper's charges.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement from his parliamentary office, he said he had
''no recollection in detail'' of the alleged transfer from 18 years
ago. But he said it was ''nothing new'' that the Christian
Democrats transferred money from the parliamentary faction to party
coffers ahead of the March 1983 parliamentary election.
</P>
<P>
   ''All this has absolutely nothing to do with the alleged setting
up of slush funds for this reason,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl, who stepped down as party chairman after his 1998 election
defeat, touched off the scandal last December by admitting he had
accepted about $1 million in illegal party donations during the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It has expanded since then to include revelations of slush funds
and secret bank accounts abroad, as well as allegations that Kohl's
government traded favors for cash -- something Kohl has steadfastly
denied.

<HEADLINE> DOT Announces Truck Safety Rules  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Trucking companies that get unsatisfactory
safety ratings from federal regulators will be threatened with
shutdown under new rules announced Thursday by the Transportation
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, motor carriers that move passengers or hazardous
materials could be shut down if they get poor ratings, but regular
cargo shippers could not.
</P>
<P>
   ''This rule will save lives by applying our fitness standard to
all large trucks, instead of only passenger buses and trucks
hauling hazardous materials,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater said.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule takes effect Nov. 20 and prohibits any motor
carrier found to be unfit from operating commercial motor vehicles
in interstate commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Federal inspectors periodically check and rate shippers, looking
at their maintenance and safety programs, recordkeeping, drug and
alcohol programs and other factors. An unsatisfactory safety rating
means that a motor carrier does not have adequate safety controls
in place.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rule, most motor carriers will have 60 days after
being rated unsatisfactory to improve their safety fitness or cease
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The period may be extended another 60 days if the carrier is
making a good-faith effort to improve its safety fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Passenger and hazardous-material carriers will continue to have
45 days to correct deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Carriers holding an unsatisfactory rating at the time the rule
becomes effective are not subject to immediate shutdown, the
department said. However, if after a follow-up visit the carrier
still is rated unfit the new provisions will apply.
</P>
<P>
   Currently unsatisfactory ratings have an economic impact on a
company, discouraging shippers and insurance companies from doing
business with them, but there is no enforcement mechanism for
general carriers.

<HEADLINE> Pataki says law will bolster Braille instruction  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Reading Braille, something of a dying talent
among the blind and people whose vision is seriously impaired, will
soon be far more common in New York, Gov. George Pataki said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki signed a bill into law called the ''Blind Students
Literacy Rights and Education Act.'' It will require school
districts to make the study of Braille part of the education plans
for every visually impaired student.
</P>
<P>
   The law starts from the presumption that learning to ''read''
Braille - a system of raised dots signifying letters and words
which are felt with the fingertips - is as important for the
visually impaired as reading conventionally is for everyone else,
said a chief sponsor, Republican state Sen. George Maziarz of
Niagara County.
</P>
<P>
   ''Literacy is the single most important ability one must possess
in order to become productive in our society,'' Maziarz said.
''This ability is as essential for someone who is visually impaired
as it is for someone who is sighted.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Federation of the Blind says that fewer than 10
percent of blind students in the United States now know Braille,
compared to about 40 percent in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Speech-synthesized computers and cassette tapes have largely
taken over as the way the visually impaired understand printed
materials. But state officials said it is hard for the blind to
learn grammar, spelling and punctuation in that manner.
</P>
<P>
   ''This legislation begins to address the problem of illiteracy
among the blind,'' said Carl Jacobsen, president of the New York
affiliate of the National Federation of the Blind.
</P>
<P>
   David Ernst, a spokesman for the state School Boards
Association, said his group supported the bill and believes it will
make law something many of the association's member districts
already do.
</P>
<P>
   A range of other groups that advocate for the visually impaired
supported the measure, including the American Council of the Blind
and the American Foundation for the Blind.
</P>
<P>
   On other bills:
</P>
<P>
   -The governor vetoed a measure that would have required that the
state's Lemon Law for defective automobiles apply to the air
emissions testing machines the state is making service stations
have downstate where smog is high.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said there was a range of problems with the measure past
the philosophical difficulty he had in extending protections for
vehicle owners to service stations testing those vehicles emissions
at inspection time. He said his commissioners would work with
service station representatives and the manufacturers of the
analyzing equipment to straighten out any problems with the
machines.
</P>
<P>
   -Pataki vetoed legislation that would have required the new
state Office for Science, Technology and Academic Research to
establish a Web site on the Internet known as ''High-Tech New
York.'' It would have promoted New York as a site for the
establishment of high-technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the plans were so ambitious it would have cost
$1 million to establish the Web site and $100,000 a year to
maintain it.
</P>
<P>
   -The governor signed a measure into law toughening penalties for
underage drinkers who've been caught driving drunk.
</P>
<P>
   The measure requires that convictions in other states for
driving under the influence would be treated the same by New York
as if they had happened here. Thus, while someone under 21 might
face a penalty of six-months-license-revocation for a conviction in
another state, that penalty is enhanced to a one-year revocation in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   -Pataki signed a bill requiring service stations which offer
self-serve gasoline at prices lower than at their full-serve pump
to give the lower self-serve price to people with disabled license
plates. That requirement will be in effect daily from 7 a.m. to 7
p.m. starting Oct. 1, 2001, the bill stipulates.
</P>
<P>
   -Littering in New York City subways will become more expensive
starting Nov. 1, 2000, under another bill signed by Pataki. It
raises from a $50 fine or eight hours community service for a first
offense of littering on subways to a $250 fine or eight hours
community service.

<HEADLINE> CDC: High-School Smoking Down in '99  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Smoking among high-schoolers dropped slightly
last year after climbing for most of the 1990s, the government said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Government analysts attributed the drop to teen smoking
prevention programs and the higher cost of cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The good news is we appear to be cresting or starting to
decline from the epidemic of the 1990s,'' said Terry Pechacek,
associate director of the Office of Smoking and Health at the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC said 34.8 percent of high school students in 1999
reported that they had smoked a cigarette in the previous 30 days.
That was down from 36.4 percent in 1997 and the first overall
decline since the government's first such study, in 1991. The
studies are done every two years.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking dropped 17 percent among high school freshmen in what
was seen as a particularly encouraging sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where we're having the impact,'' Pechacek said. ''It's
when they're in that transition period, from having tried a
cigarette behind the football stands to daily smoking.''
</P>
<P>
   But government analysts also said community efforts are being
foiled by tobacco advertising that hooks young smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies said they are complying with the 1998 national
tobacco settlement, in which they agreed not to market to young
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not want kids to smoke, period,'' said Steve Kottak, a
spokesman for Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., which makes Kools
and Lucky Strike cigarettes. ''We want to work with our critics on
this. All of us share responsibility. Rather than pointing fingers,
let's try to solve the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   While the smoking rate dropped among high school freshmen -- from
33.4 percent in 1997 to 27.6 percent in 1999 -- it rose among
12th-graders, from 39.6 percent to 42.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And the number of frequent smokers, defined as those having
smoked at least 20 of the past 30 days, rose to 16.8 percent --
about one-third higher than it was in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The smoking rate for black high school students dropped from
22.7 percent to 19.7 percent -- markedly lower than the national
level. Pechacek said black parents are often stricter than
middle-class whites when it comes to tobacco. Smoking among white
high school students fell from 39.7 percent to 38.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Surgeon General David Satcher said the CDC study offers hope
that teen smoking figures have peaked. But he said only 5 percent
of American schools have adopted the CDC's guidelines for
discouraging smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Failure to effectively use every intervention strategy
available to help our young people would be tragic mistake,''
Satcher said in a statement. ''The time to act is now.''
</P>
<P>
   The government wants to cut teen smoking by half, to about 16
percent, by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Thun, an American Cancer Society epidemiologist, said
the statistics show that states should devote more of their tobacco
settlement money to community-based prevention programs targeting
children.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids have seen smoking as a form of rebellion against
adults,'' Thun said. ''What they need to see is that not smoking is
a form of not being manipulated by the tobacco companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC surveyed more than 15,000 students in 50 states and the
District of Columbia to compile the statistics. Researchers
cautioned the data could be misleading because they do not include
high school dropouts, who are more likely to smoke.

<HEADLINE> New Clinton Grand Jury Meets  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray came to the
federal courthouse Thursday as a new grand jury investigating
President Clinton met for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ray and several prosecutors who work for him carried boxes of
documents into the third-floor area where five grand juries were
conducting business, the Clinton grand jury among them.
</P>
<P>
   Ray did not comment on his presence at the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Wednesday responding to Democratic criticism, Ray
said the case involves ''serious allegations of perjury and
obstruction of justice by the President of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray confirmed last week that the grand jury, impaneled July 11,
would delve into Clinton's actions in the Monica Lewinsky scandal.
The jurors also met Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ray has said his duties include considering whether to seek an
indictment of the president after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Ken Starr, conducted a grand jury probe through
most of 1998, leaving voluminous files of evidence and testimony
that could be used in the current grand jury probe. The Starr
investigation led to Clinton's impeachment by the House.

<HEADLINE> Fiberglass cows under siege in NYC  </HEADLINE>
By SHARON L. CRENSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - This city is no place for a helpless cow. Not
the dairy kind, not an Angus steer (unless it's sliced up next to a
glass of cabernet sauvignon), and not for the hand-painted,
fiberglass variety.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their successful tour in Chicago last year, the 500
bovine beauties on exhibit around New York this summer have proved
nearly as popular with vandals and thieves as tourists and art
lovers.
</P>
<P>
   They've been scrawled on with magic marker, tipped over by
urbanites emulating the strange ritual drunken rural college
students practice on real cows, and at least two of the heifers
have been snatched. Well, almost.
</P>
<P>
   One disappeared in June, but turned up the next day across the
park from where it was originally placed. Speculation was the
80-pound, 7-foot long, 4-foot tall sculpture was just too unwieldy
to haul away.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Wednesday, NYPD Det. Andrew McDermott said he caught
Patrick Kraft, of East Windsor, N.J., and Michael Macisco of
Stratford, Conn., trying to load a purple cow into a Jeep in
Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   ''They wanted to put it in front of their friend's house as a
practical joke,'' McDermott said they told him. ''They were
contemplating other things - leaving it on another friend's
doorstep. They mentioned leaving it in front of a vegetarian
restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   The would-be calf-nappers pleaded innocent late Wednesday night
to grand larceny, criminal possession of stolen property and
criminal mischief. They were released without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the accused returned phone calls Thursday, but David
Cohen, Kraft's attorney, said his client simply found the cow on
its side in the middle of the street.
</P>
<P>
   ''It did not appear at all to be a work of art,'' he said. ''A
piece of junk is what it appeared.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that his client meant to disparage the art. He just thought
somebody put it out on the street for the taking, as New Yorkers do
with all manner of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The cow Kraft and Macisco coveted was created by Edwina Sandys,
Winston Churchill's granddaughter. If an auction of Chicago's 1999
lot is any indication, it could sell for perhaps $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   About 75 of New York's arty cows - including Sandys' - are set
to be auctioned off Sept. 28 for charity.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called the attempted theft
''despicable,'' but said the vandalism against the cows is to be
expected in a city the size of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way the cows have been treated for the most part has been
very respectful,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   The organization sponsoring CowParade has offered a $1,000
reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of
anyone responsible for stealing or damaging any of the cows.

By BRENDAN SCHURR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) - They looked so good together. He,
wearing a black suit and light blue tie. She, dressed in black with
aqua trim. Smiling and hugging like old friends.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the way it was supposed to look. President
Clinton with an arm draped around mayor and Congressional candidate
Susan Bass Levin before television and newspaper cameras from
across the state was Levin's dream photo opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Wednesday night appearance at a cocktail reception
here not only helped Levin raise a quarter of a million dollars, it
elevated the profile and credibility of a candidate well-known in
the region but little-known elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden she seems to be not just a local or regional
player, but someone who rubs elbows with the rich and famous on the
political scene,'' David Rebovich, a Rider University political
science professor, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Levin is trying to unseat U.S. Rep. James Saxton, R-Mount Holly,
who's been the 3rd District representative for 16 years and has had
an easy time cruising to re-election. In his 25 years in the state
Legislature and in Congress, Saxton has never lost.
</P>
<P>
   But Levin is his first challenger with more than $1 million to
spend. With the $250,000 from Wednesday's event, the campaign has
raised about $1.3 million, said Sallie Stohler, Levin's campaign
manager. She declined to say how much the campaign has on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Saxton's campaign has $1.72 million on hand, said campaign
manager David White.
</P>
<P>
   White characterized the president's visit as less of an
endorsement than a political payback to Levin, who co-chaired the
Clinton-Gore campaign in New Jersey in 1996 and has helped raise
money for the state Democratic party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think this visit by the president is far less about their
expectations of winning the seat than it is about returning the
favor to her for all the fund-raising effort that she has done for
the party,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the motivation, there's no doubt the visit gave the
Levin campaign a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ''It exceeded all expectations,'' Stohler said, adding that at
least 700 people attended the reception - about 300 more than were
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Carroll, a senior research associate at the Center for
American Women in Politics and a political science professor at
Rutgers University, said Levin had little to lose and a lot to gain
by having Clinton campaign for her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you can find a better fund-raiser at the moment
than President Clinton,'' she said. ''He has an incredible track
record and lots of draw. I think any Democratic Congressional
candidate would be sort of crazy not to try to draw President
Clinton in to help with fund raising.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll said what is less certain is the effect his visit will
have on voters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clinton is a mixed bag. He's clearly an incredibly popular
president. As people think of him leaving office, his star power is
even going up,'' she said. ''But there are a lot of people who hate
him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said those who dislike Clinton, though, are unlikely to be
prospective Levin voters.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Saxton camp will be getting a high-profile
visit of their own. U.S. Sen. John McCain is scheduled to host a
rally and fund raiser for Saxton on Sept. 24.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Fraternal Order of Police on Thursday endorsed
Saxton. Union President Richard Whelan cited Saxton's support of
crime-fighting grants, tougher sentences for violent criminals and
support of gun control measures.

<HEADLINE> More than 320 crows test positive for West Nile virus  </HEADLINE>
By AMY WESTFELDT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The number of dead birds that have tested
positive for the West Nile virus has nearly doubled in a week to
322 and expanded to a 10th county, state officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The number of birds testing positive for the mosquito-borne
virus jumped from 165 last Thursday and includes one bird found in
Mercer County, health officials said. All are crows except one, a
cockatiel.
</P>
<P>
   The publicity about the West Nile virus and counties'
intensified mosquito control efforts have prompted more residents
to call about dead crows they have found, which has led to more
testing, said Dennis McGowan, a spokesman for the state Department
of Health and Senior Services. But McGowan said the numbers likely
mean the virus has reached new heights in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we're really at the peak right now,'' McGowan said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of affected crows in Essex County more than tripled,
from 10 to 39, the department said. Bergen County crows rose from
51 to 84, while the birds found in Union County more than doubled
from 14 to 34.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six birds were found in Hudson County, up from 18 last
week, 68 were in Middlesex County, 29 in Monmouth County, 27 in
Passaic, three in Morris County, one in Somerset and one in Mercer,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   No humans in New Jersey have tested positive for the virus,
which killed seven people and sickened scores last year in New York
City. Three Staten Island residents have tested positive for the
virus this year. The virus is carried to birds by infected
mosquitoes. It is potentially life-threatening to the elderly and
those with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
   Test results on 11 suspected cases of the virus in New Jersey
are still pending, health officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Four pools of mosquitoes collected in Bergen County in late July
have tested positive for the virus, but none of the 10,000
mosquitoes analyzed by the Centers for Disease Control, sentinel
chickens or sparrows have tested positive.
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Bob
Shinn said the increased numbers of birds will not prompt the state
to begin aerial spraying.
</P>
<P>
   ''If counties continue their effective control strategies, using
focused, intense, ground applications to further reduce the adult
mosquito population on an as-needed basis, we are unlikely to need
aerial spraying of urban areas,'' Shinn said.
</P>
<P>
   CDC officials said they would return to northern New Jersey this
weekend to conduct a second round of tests on mosquitoes and
sparrows to track the progress of the virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives us a better handle on the way the virus behaves
naturally so that it helps us translate into what the human health
risk is,'' said Steve Ostroff, the federal West Nile coordinator
for the CDC.
</P>
<P>
   A third round of testing is planned before the mosquito season
officially ends before the first frost of the year, he said.

<HEADLINE> More bad news likely ahead from eye-care company  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - Analysts predicted even more bad news
ahead for eye-care company Bausch &AMP; Lomb, which saw its stocks dive
Thursday after warning that revenue and earnings would be lower
than expected this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said they eliminated the job of president and
chief operating officer Carl Fassano after recent meetings with
managers uncovered a number of problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think their arms are around everything yet,'' said
Douglas Christopher, a Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co. analyst in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   William Carpenter, chairman and chief executive, told investors
that the earnings shortfall drove him to ''remove a layer of
management, bringing me in even closer touch with the day-to-day
activities of the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Christopher said, ''It's hard for me to believe removing one
person is going to fix this.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock tumbled nearly $20 per share, closing down
more than 35 percent at 35 13-16.
</P>
<P>
   The company blamed lower than expected demand for contact lens
care items, troubles meeting demand for surgical intraocular
lenses, competition in the market for hearing products and the
weakened value of the euro.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of problems ''is alarming,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It raises the question of whether this an industry-wide issue
or if there are deeper issues at Bausch &AMP; Lomb. These obviously are
not temporary issues,'' Goldman Sachs analyst Lawrence Keusch told
TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, specialty contact lens and medical product maker
Cooper Companies Inc. countered that opinion with its own news
Thursday that it expects third quarter revenues to be up 17 percent
over last year. Analysts expect the company to earn .55 cents per
share, compared with $0.46 cents a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher blamed Bausch &AMP; Lomb's problems on both competition,
the state of the dollar, and the company's preoccupation with
acquiring other businesses. It spent $3.7 million attempting to
take over cosmetic contact lens maker Wesley Jessen VisionCare Inc.
The Des Plaines, Ill.-based company revealed in May it had accepted
a $785 million buyout offer from Atlanta-based CIBA Vision.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb said its revenues for the rest of 2000, excluding
the acquisition in July of French pharmaceutical company Groupe
Chauvin, are expected to be essentially flat or even slightly lower
than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Including the acquisition, it said earnings per share should be
approximately 70-72 cents in the third quarter and 83-85 cents in
the fourth quarter, to end the year in the range of $2.69 to $2.72
before one-time items.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson Financial had expected,
on average, earnings of 93 cents a share for the third quarter,
$1.06 for the fourth quarter and $3.15 for the year.
</P>
<P>
   In its eye care business, Bausch &AMP; Lomb said new products, such
as continuous wear lenses, one-day lenses and disposable specialty
lenses have drawn more of their wearers from existing products
rather than bringing new patients into the market.
</P>
<P>
   It also cited pressure from rivals who are cutting prices to
gain market share, resulting in lower revenue growth. The company's
biggest rivals in that market are Johnson &AMP; Johnson and CIBA
Vision.
</P>
<P>
   For 2001, Bausch &AMP; Lomb said revenue growth would be in the
''mid-single digits,'' excluding the impact of the acquisition, and
in the ''upper single digits,'' including that acquisition. The
company would not be more specific about those estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share in 2001 should be in the range of $2.87 to
$2.92, the company said. First Call/Thomson Financial's survey
showed analysts expected $3.84 a share on average in earnings for
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb said results from its Dr. Mann Pharma business in
Germany, which represents about 40 percent of its pharmaceuticals
segment, has been hurt by the continued weakening of the euro
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ''To say that I find these results unacceptable is a gross
understatement,'' Carpenter said. Nonetheless, he said the company
will not back down on its promise to grow earnings 15 percent over
the next few years. He also promised details of aggressive changes
by the time of their third quarter release in October.
</P>
<P>
   Bausch &AMP; Lomb has annual revenues of approximately $1.8 billion
and employs about 12,000 in more than 50 countries.

<HEADLINE> POLITICS: Few state races see primary contests  </HEADLINE>
By MATTHEW DALY
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -After eight years in the state House of
Representatives, Rep. Edna I. Garcia of Bridgeport wants to move up
to the state Senate. There's only one problem: The man holding the
seat - Sen. Alvin W. Penn - isn't going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   In order to move up, Garcia must defeat her fellow Democrat in a
Sept. 12 primary - an outcome that even she concedes is unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Penn, the third-ranking Democrat in the Senate, has won by wide
margins in each of the past four elections and has a host of
powerful friends, including Bridgeport Mayor Joseph Ganim and
Democratic town Chairman Mario Testa.
</P>
<P>
   And with her campaign already more than $1,000 in debt, Garcia
is unlikely to have enough money needed to get her message out
before voters go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ''As you know, it's very difficult to unseat an incumbent,''
Garcia said. ''However I still believe I am giving the voters a
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   That choice is one few voters around the state will be able to
make this year.
</P>
<P>
   Of 374 possible contests for major party nominations to
legislative seats in Connecticut, just seven will be decided in the
Sept. 12 primary, election officials say. Four of the seven,
including Garcia's battle against Penn, are in Bridgeport.
</P>
<P>
   State Reps. Ernest E. Newton II and Hector Diaz, both Bridgeport
Democrats, face primary challenges, as does Bridgeport City Council
member Lydia Martinez, a Democrat and the endorsed candidate in
Garcia's old district.
</P>
<P>
   Other primaries scheduled Sept. 12 include Hartford's 3rd
District, where Democratic Rep. Minnie Gonzalez faces a challenge
from Martha Allen-Johnson; the 66th District in Litchfield County
where Litchfield First Selectman Craig Miner faces fellow
Republican William Butterly; and the 36th District in Middlesex
County where three Democrats are vying to run for a seat held by
retiring Democratic Rep. Claire Sauer.
</P>
<P>
   The dearth of candidates extends to the general election as
well. Nearly one-third of the 187 legislative seats being decided
Nov. 7 have only one major-party candidate, and dozens of races are
completely uncontested.
</P>
<P>
   That fact, coming a year after 43 races for mayor or first
selectman were uncontested in 1999, leads some to worry that
Connecticut's democracy is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ''It concerns me greatly because when you don't have full
slates, there's not much reason for people to vote and participate
in the process,'' said Secretary of the State Susan Bysiewicz,
whose office monitors elections in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen declining participation in elections, and it
doesn't help with fewer candidates because then there is less
debate and that causes less interest,'' Bysiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Bysiewicz and others attributed the declining number of
contested races to several factors, including the strong economy
and the escalating cost of campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of qualified potential candidates who say 'Why
bother?' when they see you need $100,000 for a Senate race or
$50,000 for a House race,'' Bysiewicz said. ''We're pricing the
average person right out of the process.''
</P>
<P>
   And because state legislators are paid far below salaries paid
in the private sector, many would-be candidates opt out of public
service, Bsyiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when challengers emerge, they rarely win. Only two sitting
legislators were defeated in 1998 - meaning incumbents were
returned to office more than 98 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Those odds don't faze Garcia, who says she is in the race to
win.
</P>
<P>
   A high-school teacher and 30-year city resident, Garcia accused
Penn of ignoring the district to pursue statewide issues such as
racial profiling and police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the senator to be out telling elected officials in
Trumbull and Shelton how to run their towns when we are having
problems in Bridgeport takes time away from constituents when he
should be doing their work,'' Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
   Penn scoffed at that and said his constituents appreciate that
he has not ''stood by and watched the wind blow. I've always spoken
out.''
</P>
<P>
   As a state senator, ''It's my job to speak about injustice, even
if it was in New Mexico,'' Penn said. ''I represent all the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Penn, who has worked with Garcia for the past eight years, said
he was ''hurt'' by her candidacy but confident he would win.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's hard for me to go full-force against a friend, but this
election is very important, because our people in Bridgeport need
somebody who can represent them.''

<HEADLINE> 30 years of tests chart gains and slips among U.S. students  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - America's schoolchildren are doing a little
better in mathematics than they were a decade ago, but for many of
them reading and science skills have declined slightly since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The government's 1999 National Assessment of Education Progress
also shows a widening gap in the test performance of white and
black elementary school students on reading, math and science. And
black 17-year-olds on average are still four years behind whites in
their reading skills.
</P>
<P>
   Sure to become fodder for Al Gore and George W. Bush, both
self-described ''education'' candidates, the Education Department
report paints a mixed picture of improving and falling test scores
and narrowing and widening learning gaps.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration quickly pointed to ''consistent and
steady gains'' in math scores in the report. Bush, meanwhile, said
the report documents that student achievement stagnated during
President Clinton's term in office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will be committed to making sure that we do not repeat the
mediocrity of the 1990s,'' Bush said. ''The achievement gap between
minority and white students is still too wide.''
</P>
<P>
   There is data both campaigns can use to trumpet their competing
education agendas, said Amy Wilkins, a policy analyst with
Education Trust, a Washington-based research group.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an easy one for the Bush people,'' she said. ''In the
'90s we flatlined. He can say look at the flatness. He'll say look
what I did in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   ''For Gore, it's harder,'' she said. ''This corresponds to his
time as vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's campaign staff did not immediately respond to a request
for his reaction to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But Education Secretary Richard Riley took up the cudgel.
''There is good news here, too,'' he said, citing the improvement
in math scores and better reading skills among 9-year-olds since
1994. ''We know how to improve our schools. ...We need those who
count themselves as 'congressional leaders' to get on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Though teaching and testing schoolchildren is largely a state
function, the federal government started the National Assessment of
Educational Progress more than 30 years ago to measure the nation
as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   The tests first were given to a sample of 9-, 13- and
17-year-olds - key age levels in a child's school career. The main
subjects tested are reading, math and science - though now the
program includes tests in art, civics, writing and music. Roughly
48,000 students were tested in that manner last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because each state is free to design and use its own tests, any
comparison of one state with another is impossible based on the
scores.
</P>
<P>
   But test administrators said the survey still remains the
nation's best measure of how elementary, middle school and
high-school-age students have learned the core subjects of reading
math and science.
</P>
<P>
   ''It gives some evidence to answer the popular question of
whether or not the schools are improving,'' said Michael T.
Nettles, vice chairman of the National Assessment Governing Board,
the panel that sets the rules for states giving the tests.
</P>
<P>
   While there was a narrowing since 1992 of the gaps in reading
skills of 17-year-old blacks and whites and the science skills of
13-years-olds, the disparities were unchanged or increased in every
other test category.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't continue to say 'everything is fine' when millions of
black and brown children are being left behind,'' said Kati
Haycock, director of Education Trust. ''The progress is too slow
and the gaps remain painfully wide.''

<HEADLINE> Quinnipiac Poll: Gore, Corzine maintain leads over GOP opponents in N.J. </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Vice President Al Gore is enjoying a
post-convention bounce in New Jersey, pulling ahead in what was
once a close race with Texas Gov. George W. Bush, according to a
new poll.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinnipiac University Poll, released Thursday, also
indicates that Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine has
maintained his early lead over Republican Bob Franks, but the gap
is closing.
</P>
<P>
   Gore bounced back to a 49-37 percent lead over Bush in the
telephone poll of 802 registered voters conducted just after the
conclusion of the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles.
Four percent of those responding said they favored Ralph Nader of
the Green Party, and Pat Buchanan of the Reform Party was favored
by 1 percent of those polled.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had a double-digit lead in early polls conducted in New
Jersey by the Connecticut university, but Bush narrowed the margin
to a mere 5 percentage points in June and July.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate race, Corzine leads Franks 43-35 percent, with 19
percent undecided. Corzine held a 50-30 advantage in a July
Quinnipiac poll.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac political science professor Scott McLean said Gore
derived several benefits from the convention, including higher
favorability ratings from two key New Jersey voting blocs, women
and independents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gore has to hope that his convention creates a new
issues-based dynamic in the race, and not just a temporary spike in
favorability,'' McLean said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for both Senate candidates put a positive spin on the
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine spokesman Tom Shea said the Democratic candidate is
happy to be ahead, albeit by a slimmer margin than earlier in the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think what we're seeing is Democrats and Republicans
settling in behind their two candidates while the independent group
is still not focused entirely on the race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'd certainly rather be up eight than down eight,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Franks spokesman Charlie Smith acknowledged the poll numbers
indicating that more voters have heard of Corzine, but noted that
more also are likely to have an unfavorable opinion of him.
Corzine's favorable-to-unfavorable ratio in the poll is 19 percent
to 17 percent, while Franks is at 13-6. Remaining voters either had
no opinion of the candidates, or did not know enough about them.
</P>
<P>
   ''While a majority of New Jersey voters know who he is and have
heard his message, they're unwilling to embrace him,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Franks is confident he'll be able to pull even with Corzine, his
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are 74 days to go,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The university polled 802 registered New Jersey voters from Aug.
18-22. The poll's margin of error is plus or minus 3.5 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Lee To Play Tennis for Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
By BOB GREENE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even for a tennis player, Janet Lee has a lot of
addresses.
</P>
<P>
   She was born in Lafayette, Ind. For most of her life, including
now, she lives in Rancho Palos Verdes, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   But later this month, Lee will play doubles at the Sydney
Olympics, competing for Chinese Taipei -- the International Olympic
Committee's name for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the U.S. Open qualifying this week, Lee is listed as
being from the United States. On Thursday, she won her first-round
match, beating Eva Krejcova of the Czech Republic 6-3, 7-6 (3).
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know that,'' Lee said when told that she was listed
as being from the United States rather than from Taiwan. ''I don't
look at the draw, but it's been changed for about three years. In
November 1997 I officially chose Taipei.''
</P>
<P>
   As a junior, she won the 1991 USTA Girls 14s and, two years
later, the Girls 18s. The same two years, she won the same two age
groups in the Easter Bowl, a tournament restricted to American
players.
</P>
<P>
   She's not alone on the worldwide tennis tour with more than one
flag plastered on their luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Gonzalez, who grew up in Puerto Rico, played Davis Cup
for Paraguay. Mark Merklein of Gainesville, Fla., played Davis Cup
for the Bahamas. Peter Wright, currently the tennis coach at the
University of California, is also the Davis Cup coach and a former
player for Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   As a junior, Lee was spotlighted by the U.S. Tennis Association,
which helped with her coaching and travel. It made her decision to
switch countries more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''I considered playing for Taiwan for several months,'' she
said. ''The USTA had put money into me and I didn't want my
decision to affect how the USTA might treat other Asian-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''But there were a lot more opportunities for me in Taiwan. It
was a fun move for me.''
</P>
<P>
   She plays Fed Cup -- the women's version of Davis Cup -- for
Chinese Taipei, the Asian Games every four years and tournaments in
Taiwan and other countries in the Far East.
</P>
<P>
   Once, she said, she played two tournaments in Tokyo in
consecutive weeks. The tournaments were held at the same facility,
but the players had to change hotels on the middle Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, she logged more frequent flier miles than she
really wanted.
</P>
<P>
   ''I played a tournament in June in Taiwan between the French
Open and Wimbledon,'' she said. ''It was on hardcourt.''
</P>
<P>
   In that three-week period, she played three different surfaces
while circling the globe. Almost normal for today's professional
tennis players.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's partner on the Taiwan Fed Cup team until she recently
retired was Shi-Ting Wang, who won six tournaments during her
career.
</P>
<P>
   At the Sydney Olympics, Lee will be paired with Tzu-Ting Weng.
They were awarded wild-card berths into the doubles competition.
Lee is ranked 161st in the world in doubles, Weng 333rd -- the two
highest-ranked doubles players from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   When they step onto the court in Sydney, it will be the first
time they have played doubles together since they were 14. Lee said
she met Weng while they were playing an International Tennis
Federation junior event in Taipei. By chance, Lee even stayed at
Weng's home during the tournament.

<HEADLINE> Relatives Mourn Russia Sub Victims  </HEADLINE>
By ANGELA CHARLTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Reeling from shock and heartbreak, relatives
tossed flowers Thursday into the waves of the frigid, gray Barents
Sea in tribute to 118 men killed when their nuclear submarine
crumpled in an explosion and sank to the silt below.
</P>
<P>
   While some family members still insisted they want the bodies
retrieved before they will mourn, most boarded a Russian ship for
the area near where the Kursk went down Aug. 12, as their anger
over the tragedy that transfixed this nation turned into grief and
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Wives, mothers and fathers with ashen faces huddled together and
looked over the deck railings. An Orthodox priest and Muslim cleric
led prayers for the victims, then the relatives threw fresh flowers
and wreaths, including one from President Vladimir Putin, into the
sea. The boat circled the floating flowers before returning to
shore.
</P>
<P>
   The disaster has been a grueling ordeal for the families, many
of whom found out about the sinking only from television reports,
then endured days of a confused rescue operation, then only heard
from Norwegian divers that their sons and husbands were dead.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, many relatives of the crew clustered to watch
the laying of a foundation stone for a memorial to the Kursk in the
town of Vidyayevo, where the ship had been based. Two women
fainted, and several people fell onto the grassy slope sobbing and
kissing the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Farewell, my son!'' one woman wailed.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and the government came under heavy attack from Russians
for the slow, contradictory reports on the disaster. In an
unusually humble response for a Russian leader, Putin said on
national television Wednesday night that he felt ''responsible and
guilty'' for the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Vlasov, a former submarine officer who was on the
relatives' boat Thursday, recalled how he accompanied his son
Sergei to the Kursk when it left for the military exercises that
would take his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, Dad, it's three days,'' Vlasov said on ORT
television.
</P>
<P>
   Vlasov said he was reluctant to throw flowers into the sea. ''I
don't want to throw a wreath. I am waiting'' to see Sergei's body,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is negotiating with Norwegian and Dutch companies for
help lifting the submarine and recovering the bodies. But such a
project was not likely to begin at the site above the Arctic Circle
until next spring, Russian officials say.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Norwegian company cautioned Thursday that
any attempt to raise the vessel must be weighed against the
environmental risk of a potential radiation leak.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has ever lifted a nuclear submarine before, and that
opens all kinds of questions,'' said Julian Thomson, spokesman for
Stolt Offshore oil services company.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson, whose company sent the rescue divers, said the
questions include the state of the two nuclear reactors, torpedoes
and other munitions on board. No radiation leaks have been recorded
so far by Russian or foreign sensors.
</P>
<P>
   It was Norwegian divers who finally opened the Kursk's escape
hatch and determined all aboard were dead. Norway's military said
Thursday that early information from the Russians was so bad that
the Norwegians were not sure conditions were safe enough for the
diving team to continue.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear what caused the explosions that crippled the
Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   While top Russian officials say the most likely cause was a
collision with a foreign submarine, no concrete evidence has been
provided. Others say a likely scenario was an internal malfunction
and explosion in the Kursk's torpedo compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread dismay over the Kursk crisis, Putin's support
does not appear to have been undermined, according to a poll
released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The poll by the All-Russia Center for Public Opinion Research
showed Putin's approval rating at 65 percent. That was nearly
identical to the previous poll, the newspaper Segodnya cited poll
director Yuri Levada as saying. The poll surveyed 1,600 people from
Saturday to Monday. No margin of error was given.

<HEADLINE> GPU Energy exec apologizes for poor service in Morris County  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORRISTOWN, N.J. (AP) - GPU Energy is really, really sorry.
</P>
<P>
   A top executive apologized Wednesday to the Morris County Board
of Freeholders for the company's poor performance in Morris County,
where residents have been subject to numerous outages this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not been doing what we should be doing for a long
time, and I'm here to fix it,'' said Michael B. Roche, the
company's senior vice president of New Jersey operations and
customer service. He promised GPU would ''do much, much better'' in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Reading, Pa.-based utility is giving its New Jersey
executives more freedom to make quicker decisions, and increasing
its capital-improvement program for the region from $130 million to
$188 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate the changes, but your company has never been as
responsive as Jersey Central Power &AMP; Light,'' Morris County Sheriff
Edward Rochford told Roche. GPU bought JCP&AMP;L in 1989 to serve
customers in Morris, Sussex, Warren, Somerset and Hunterdon
counties.
</P>
<P>
   He complained of five lengthy power outages that occurred
recently at the new county jail in Morris Township.
</P>
<P>
   And Freeholder Margaret Nordstrom cited ''multi-day outages'' in
Washington Township, where she serves as a councilwoman.
</P>
<P>
   Freeholder Director Douglas Cabana was even more blunt in his
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   He said people in Boonton, where he is a councilman, ''build
homes with generators because they can't count on GPU.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche cited severe storms, the rapid growth of demand caused by
the county's growing population, and difficulty in reaching trouble
spots due to traffic for some of the problems.

<HEADLINE> AC, police officer, tentatively settle sex harassment case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Atlantic City and a police officer who
charged that supervisors and colleagues sexually harassed her have
reached a tentative, $1.4 million settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Sgt. Donna Hurley and the city reached the tentative
agreement Tuesday in U.S. District Court here before Judge Joseph
Irenas, said Clifford Van Syoc, Hurley's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley, the first woman in the department to reach the rank of
sergeant, accused supervisors and fellow officers of harassing her
with obscene comments and drawings. Once, she said, a sanitary
napkin with sergeant's stripes was hung above the podium where she
conducted daily roll call. Another time, someone hung one from the
rearview mirror of her patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   The harassment was condoned by department officials, who passed
her over for promotion, she said in her civil lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement covers her sexual harassment lawsuit and her part
of a 1996 lawsuit accusing the department of retaliation. Van Syoc
said the department also retaliated against her husband at the
time, Patrick Hurley, also a sergeant on the force, by denying them
transfers.
</P>
<P>
   The two have since divorced. Patrick Hurley's part of the
lawsuit is expected to go to trial in the fall, Van Syoc said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic City Council still must approve the settlement. Mayor
James Whelan said the administration would have no comment until
the agreement is given to Council for review.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court in January upheld a $175,000 award to
Donna Hurley.
</P>
<P>
   Without comment, the justices rejected an appeal by the Atlantic
City Police Department, which said Hurley's 1996 award was due in
part to a flawed instruction to jurors.
</P>
<P>
   A jury originally awarded her $1.2 million, but Irenas later
reduced the amount to $875,000.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the $175,000 in
compensatory damages but ordered a new trial on the $700,000
punitive damages verdict.

<HEADLINE> Cherry Hill McDonald's robbed at opening  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHERRY HILL, N.J. (AP) - Police on Thursday were looking for two
men who robbed a McDonald's restaurant by binding workers with duct
tape and ordering the owner to open the safe, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The two men appeared at the restaurant on Route 38 early
Thursday morning when the owner and two employees were opening the
door, Sgt. John Thompson said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   The men, wearing masks and hooded sweatshirts and carrying
handguns, ordered store owner Steve Harrison, 54, of Mount Laurel,
to go to the office and open the safe. The other man ordered
Angelina Busa, 71, of Cherry Hill; and Patricia Robinson, 51, of
Camden, to the floor and bound them with duct tape. Harrison also
was bound with tape after opening the safe, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The men ran from the restaurant after making off with Wednesday
night's proceeds and Thursday's start-up money. Police didn't know
exactly how much money was stolen.
</P>
<P>
   A driver for the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill was filling a
newspaper vending machine at the restaurant at about 5:40 a.m. when
he noticed one of the men running from the building, Thompson said.
He went in to check on the employees and saw the three bound and
laying on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison and Robinson received minor injuries, but refused
medical treatment, Thompson said.

<HEADLINE> Akers Leaving International Matches  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Ice packs were as much a part of Michelle Akers'
uniform as her soccer cleats. While other players guzzled Gatorade,
she took IVs.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, she always played through the pain. Despite chronic
fatigue syndrome, broken bones and dozens of operations, Akers was
one of the world's top players for 15 years, leading the United
States to two World Cups and an Olympic gold.
</P>
<P>
   But after reinjuring her shoulder earlier this month, Akers
realized her body had given all it could. She said Thursday she's
retiring from international competition and won't play at the
Sydney Olympics next month.
</P>
<P>
   ''I finally said to myself, 'This is insane,''' Akers said. ''I
was battling at my absolute gut level to just get through the day,
and finally, the last straw was that I reinjured the shoulder. I
just said, enough is enough. I am no good to myself like this, and
I am certainly no good to my team.''
</P>
<P>
   She still plans to play for the new WUSA franchise in Orlando,
which starts play next April. There was no immediate word on her
replacement with the Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   Akers missed almost all of the tuneup matches for the Sydney
Games while recovering from April shoulder surgery. She'd
dislocated the shoulder in September 1998, reinjured it giving
high-fives to fans during last summer's World Cup and dislocated it
again in March while training.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 15, she jammed the shoulder in a match against Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a rare thing for someone with her injuries and illnesses
to battle as hard and long as she has to stay on the best women's
soccer team in the world,'' said Dr. Mark Adams, the national team
physician. ''However, this combination of problems and setbacks
makes it very difficult for Michelle to play to the level that she
expects of herself. She's a warrior in every sense of the word, but
it became clear to the team medical staff and to Michelle that this
was the time to step back.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers, 34, retires as the all-time leading scorer of the Women's
World Cup (12 goals), and as one of only four players in history
with 100 or more career goals. With 105 goals, 37 assists and 247
total points, she trails only Mia Hamm in all-time scoring for the
U.S. national team.
</P>
<P>
   She has made 153 appearances for the United States, and holds
U.S. records for most goals in a game (five), most goals and points
in a calendar year (39 goals in 1991) and most consecutive games
with a goal (nine).
</P>
<P>
   ''What she has been able to achieve over the last five years has
been a miracle,'' said April Heinrichs, coach of the national team.
''I'm sure that her team, like myself, supports her decision. It is
always tough to make that decision to retire and even tougher with
the Olympics just three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michelle has carried the flag for this country and her
departure is the equivalent of a John Elway retiring. We will miss
Michelle's heart, soul and courage.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5-foot-10 and with a flowing mane of curls, Akers was the
face of women's soccer before Hamm and Brandi Chastain. She's an
original member of the U.S. women's national team, scoring her
first goal in the team's second game, a 2-2 tie with Denmark on
Aug. 21, 1985.
</P>
<P>
   In the first Women's World Cup in 1991, she scored 10 goals and
became the first American to win a Golden Boot, soccer's MVP award.
She was the first female player with a shoe contract.
</P>
<P>
   ''She has changed the face of women's soccer and women's
athletics. She's one of the pioneers,'' said Tony DiCicco, the
former national team coach. ''I told her, 'Do you know what an
incredible privilege it was for me to coach you?' She's the
greatest woman that's every played the game. That's taking nothing
away from Mia or anybody else. But as far as the level she reached
in this game, there's jut no one that's played it better.''
</P>
<P>
   As good as she was on the field, Akers' perseverance over her
physical problems was even more impressive. For most of her career
she has had chronic fatigue syndrome, a disease so debilitating it
leaves many without the energy to get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   She's had more than a dozen knee operations and countless
concussions. In a tuneup for the World Cup in February 1999, she
fractured her cheekbone and two other bones near her left eye when
she collided with another player.
</P>
<P>
   In the World Cup final last summer, she played more than 90
minutes before leaving the game with heat exhaustion and a slight
concussion after colliding with another player. She needed an IV
and was still so weary the next day she had to skip victory
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   ''After winning the gold medal in 1996, I promised myself to
never again play in the condition I was in during those Olympic
games,'' Akers said. ''Since then, retirement has been a big issue
with me and the decision to continue on with the national team has
always been a prayerful and careful one. ...
</P>
<P>
   ''After battling back from a messed up shoulder and making the
Olympic team, I found myself at the end -- physically and mentally --
with a body ready for a M-A-S-H unit. It has been a hard-fought
year, and the decision not go to Sydney was just as agonizing, but
I have huge peace in knowing I fought to the very end and have
nothing else to give.''

<HEADLINE> DCF commissioner defends agency while workers allege discrimination </HEADLINE>
By DAVE COLLINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Employees of the state Department of
Children and Families told the state's human rights commission
Thursday that DCF discriminates against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But during the hearing before the Commission on Human Rights and
Opportunities, DCF Commissioner Kristine Ragaglia defended the
agency as the most diverse in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The commission will consider the evidence in deciding whether to
investigate DCF or recommend improvements at the agency. The
commission was expected to discuss the issue at its next meeting on
Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim the agency has failed to hire and promote
employees because of their race. They also claim DCF disciplines a
disproportionate number of minority workers, and removes a greater
percentage of black and Hispanic children from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Gaunichaux, a 20-year DCF veteran who works at the Long
Lane School juvenile detention center in Middletown, told the
commission that Long Lane officials have improperly changed
workers' evaluations in order to promote other workers. He also
claimed that minority workers at Long Lane are disciplined more
often than white employees.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have people playing games and commissioners don't really
get what the problems are,'' Gaunichaux said. ''We have to have
checks and balances in the system to correct problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaunichaux recommended an overhaul of the evaluation process.
</P>
<P>
   Ragaglia spoke first at the hearing and defended the department
as having the highest percentage of minorities of any state agency.
She said 41.5 percent of DCF employees are minority.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are extremely proud of that number,'' Ragaglia said. ''We
strive to have a work force that reflects the children and families
we serve.''
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner noted that the Department of Social Services
has the next highest percentage of minorities at 31.6, nearly 10
percentage points lower than DCF's rate.
</P>
<P>
   Ragaglia said minorities account for 28.3 percent of DCF
supervisors, while they make up 12.8 percent of Connecticut's
population.
</P>
<P>
   But she did acknowledge problems with the evaluation process and
DCF's Manchester office.
</P>
<P>
   Ragaglia said there are no guidelines for supervisors on how to
conduct evaluations, which can lead to inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that white workers comprise 79 percent of the
supervisor positions at the Manchester office, a number she said
concerned her. But she noted that the office, as a whole, mirrored
the community it serves.
</P>
<P>
   CHRO Commissioner Julia Powell O'Brien said she was upset that a
DCF employee survey showed a large percentage of workers reporting
problems with supervisors not respecting them.
</P>
<P>
   Amalia Vazquez Bzdyra, chairwoman of the commission, told
Ragaglia that DCF is diverse, but problems between staff and
management existed. Vazquez Bzdyra said she hoped DCF would
consider the issues raised at the hearing to make improvements at
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ragaglia said she welcomed the CHRO review, saying it would lead
to improvements at the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have been claiming for several years that DCF
discriminates against minority workers and families it serves.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOORESTOWN, N.J. (AP) - Vernon Hill, the chairman of Commerce
Bank, plans to build a 45,854-square-foot house here with two
kitchens, a greenhouse, a library, an exercise wing and other
amenities.
</P>
<P>
   The house would be almost 6,000 square feet larger than the
Washington state mansion of Microsoft Corp. chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Hill and his wife have filed plans with the township for the
home, to be built on a 44-acre parcel between Main Street and Route
38.
</P>
<P>
   Named ''Villa Collina,'' the house is designed in early
Renaissance style with two wings of windows extending from both
sides of a columned portico, the Courier-Post of Cherry Hill
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The two-story building will be 43 feet high with railings along
the top and other ornamental details to make it look like an
Italian villa.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clippers Hire Three Assistants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- John Hammond, Dennis Johnson and Rex Kalamian
were hired as assistant coaches by the Los Angeles Clippers on
Thursday, comprising the staff of new head coach Alvin Gentry.
</P>
<P>
   All three are experienced assistant coaches who have worked for
the Clippers in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ''All three assistants are good basketball minds who know the
game,'' Gentry said in a statement. ''We will be an enthusiastic
and young staff which will be great with our core of young
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Hammond, a Clippers' assistant from 1990-93, followed Gentry
from the Detroit Pistons, where he served as Gentry's top assistant
for a season-and-a-half.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a five-time NBA All-Star, returns for his second season
as a Clippers' assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Kalamian, a former assistant team scout and video coach, became
an assistant coach for the team at the start of the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   Former assistant coach and NBA career scoring leader Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar will not return to the coaching staff this year, team
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers signed first-round draft picks Darius Miles, Keyon
Dooling and Quentin Richardson earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Gentry, who was fired by the Pistons during last season, signed
a four-year deal on Aug. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who finished 15-67, fired coach Chris Ford in
February and finished the season under interim coach Jim Todd.

<HEADLINE> Peru To Reform Intelligence Service  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori's government on
Thursday announced plans to reform Peru's intelligence service,
which the president's critics say he uses to keep an authoritarian
grip on power.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal sent to Congress that would replace the National
Intelligence Service with a new organization subject to controls by
the legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The new agency, the National Intelligence Center, would
''incorporate a mechanism of oversight that will give the greatest
level of transparency possible,'' Prime Minister Federico Salas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders responded cautiously to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll believe it when I see it,'' Lima Mayor Alberto Andrade
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Salas' announcement, made in a nearly two-hour address to
Congress, came amid negotiations between Fujimori's government and
opposition leaders to hammer out a timetable for democratic reforms
proposed by the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori won an unprecedented third five-year term in May,
following a campaign marred by irregularities and accusations of
fraud. Under pressure from the OAS, Fujimori pledged to reform the
intelligence service, which has operated with autonomy from the
legislative branch.
</P>
<P>
   Salas said the intelligence bill was a clear sign of the
government's commitment to deliver on Fujimori's promise.
</P>
<P>
   Salas made no mention of Fujimori's security adviser, Vladimiro
Montesinos. Fujimori's critics say Montesinos has used the spy
agency to illegally infiltrate all branches of government on the
president's behalf, and to undercut political opposition with
coercion, bribes, and dirty tricks.
</P>
<P>
   For a decade, the reclusive spy chief has operated without an
official title or salary, answerable directly to the president.
</P>
<P>
   But Peruvians were fascinated Monday when Fujimori brought
Montesinos out of the shadows to talk with reporters, detailing the
arrest of an international arms trafficking ring that allegedly was
dealing weapons to leftist Colombian guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Swarm Invades Tigers' New Ballpark  </HEADLINE>
By JIM IRWIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- They swirled and swarmed their way through
Comerica Park, flitting into the ears, mouths and hair of hapless
Detroit Tigers fans. Some batted at them in vain. Others fled up
the aisles to seek relief.
</P>
<P>
   Untold thousands of flying ants descended on the new downtown
ballpark during the first inning of Wednesday night's game between
the Tigers and Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was bad. They were in your ears, in your eyes,
everywhere,'' said peanut vendor Charles Edwards, 60. ''Bad isn't
the word. It was terrible. I've never seen anything like that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time the bugs departed in the third inning, many of the
32,356 spectators had left their seats -- and a couple of Detroit
coaches and pitchers had kindled a preventive fire in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you looked up, it was a swarm across the sky,'' said Ron
LaCroix of Detroit. ''The birds were eating so good, they were
falling on the sidewalk. They couldn't even fly away, they were
eating so much. I've never seen anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Play was not interrupted, and Detroit went on to a 6-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   There was no recurrence of the bugs Thursday as the Tigers beat
Seattle 10-3. Though a few of the flying ants were visible, there
were no interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   ''My guess is, they'll probably occur about the same time they
did last night,'' Michigan State University entomologist Howard
Russell said. ''If it doesn't go into extra innings, they'll
probably be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night's aerial assault was not OK with Noel Selewski,
a season ticket holder from Grosse Pointe.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bugs came in like the plague,'' he said. ''I couldn't sit
in my seat. Basically, we came to the ballpark and wasted an
evening. ... It was horrible. I couldn't sit there anymore. I was
full of bugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Russell said the winged ants breed in colonies on the ground and
could swarm in the Detroit area for anywhere from four to 10 more
days. The insects might be annoying but are harmless, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers made no special preparations for Thursday's game,
spokesman Jim Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night ... was just kind of an act of God,'' he said.
''We're not taking it that seriously. We think it's an isolated
incident. We're just entering today's game like any other.''
</P>
<P>
   Some fans driven from their seats Wednesday night demanded
refunds. They won't get them, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The umpires decided to play through it,'' he said. ''We're
treating it like a rain delay. Fans may get up from their seats and
leave, but this is no different from that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Area homeowners plagued by the winged ants away from Comerica
Park won't have much success battling the bugs with insecticides,
Russell said. The chemicals can kill ants outside their nests, but
won't wipe out an entire colony, he said.

<HEADLINE> Van de Velde Shares Reno-Tahoe Lead  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Jean Van de Velde bogeyed his first hole but
later reeled off four straight birdies to grab a share of the early
first-round lead Thursday in the PGA Tour's Reno-Tahoe Open.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde finished with a 5-under par 67.
</P>
<P>
   ''It went very interesting, like every day. I had some great
shots and some shockers,'' said Van de Velde, the Frenchman who
became famous after he squandered a three-stroke lead on the last
hole of the 1999 British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased. I'd take 5 under every round of my life if I
could.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Flesch, who was in the same group, chipped in for an eagle
on one par 5, but bogeyed two others to finish in a tie for the
early clubhouse lead at 67 with Van de Velde and Emlyn Aubrey.
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Mediate, suffering from a sore neck after his chair
collapsed at the PGA Championship last weekend, and Tim Herron were
one stroke back at 68.
</P>
<P>
   Bob May, the runner-up to Tiger Woods last weekend, was among
six players two strokes back at 69. About half of field, including
Spanish star Sergio Garcia, was still to tee off Thursday afternoon
at the Montreux Golf and Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   If not for a change in qualifying rules on the PGA European
Tour, Van de Velde and Garcia would have been playing this week at
the World Golf Championships-NEC Invitational in Ohio by way of
their place on last year's Ryder Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said Wednesday he thought it was unfair to make the
change -- rewarding players who spent more time on the European
tour. But Van de Velde said the move was supported by most tour
members.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I wanted to be in the NEC I knew what I had to do. I had to
play more or better in Europe,'' said Van de Velde, who is
splitting his season on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The man who hit into a creek and triple bogeyed the last hole at
Carnoustie last year said he continues to be pleased and surprised
with the sympathetic support he gets from fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everywhere I go, people felt for me so they have been nice and
supportive. The reception is so good. It helps,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fans seem to appreciate his approach to the game, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Golf is one thing and life is another,'' Van de Velde said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I try to do as good as I can but at the end of the day,
whether I shoot a 61 or a 52 or an 82, I don't think the planet
Earth is going to stop spinning.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde, starting on the par-4 10th, hit into a greenside
bunker and bogeyed his first hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought, this is not a good a start,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But on his last nine, he birdied the first four holes primarily
on the strength of his approach shots. He hit a wedge within 3 feet
on the 413-yard, par-4 No. 1, a 9-iron to a foot away on the
429-yard par-4 3rd hole and chipped within a foot on the 518-yard,
par-5 4th.
</P>
<P>
   Flesch chipped over a bunker about 75 feet for an eagle on the
par-5 14th, but three-putted from 3 feet on one par 3 and bogeyed a
pair of par 5s.
</P>
<P>
   ''I made a couple of stupid mistakes that cost me,'' said
Flesch, who has seven top-10 finishes this year, including tying
for fifth in the Nissan Open, the Canon Greater Hartford Open and
the Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's perfect conditions. The greens are so soft you can shoot
right at the flag. ... I think there are going to be a lot of
birdies because the greens are really smooth and they're a great
pace to make putts.''

<HEADLINE> Argentine Man Arrested in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By AMPARO TREJO
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- An Argentine was arrested Thursday after a
newspaper reported that five former Argentine political prisoners
identified him as their torturer during their country's military
dictatorship, the head of Interpol in Mexico said.
</P>
<P>
   Interpol and Mexico's federal police detained Ricardo Miguel
Cavallo, an Argentine who is the director of Mexico's private
National Registry of Motor Vehicles, during a stopover in Cancun,
Interpol's Juan Miguel Ponce said. He said officials want to
question Cavallo about his identity.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving on his flight, Cavallo had told several media
organizations that he was flying to Argentina to obtain evidence to
prove his innocence.
</P>
<P>
   Under an Argentine amnesty law, military officials responsible
for human rights violations during the military dictatorship cannot
be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico City's daily Reforma newspaper reported Thursday that
Ricardo Miguel Cavallo was identified by five former political
prisoners in Argentina as being Miguel Angel Cavallo, listed as one
of the torturers at the infamous Navy Mechanical School during
Argentina's military dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who issued the warrant that kept
former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet under house arrest in
London for 16 months, has accused Miguel Angel Cavallo of torture,
falsification of documents, terrorism and car theft, according to
the Argentine human rights group Center for Social and Legal
Studies.
</P>
<P>
   However, Ponce said officials had no information on the alleged
Spanish investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Garzon, who is investigating human rights abuses under the
former military dictatorships of Chile and Argentina, has brought
charges against officials for the deaths of Spaniards in both
countries.
</P>
<P>
   At least 9,000 Argentines vanished during Argentina's 7-year
military dictatorship, which ended in 1983. Human rights groups put
the figure closer to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   An official Chilean report says 3,197 people died or disappeared
during Chile's 17-year dictatorship, which started when he ousted
elected Marxist President Salvador Allende in a military coup.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Reforma, Ricardo Miguel Cavallo denied that
he was the Argentine torturer.
</P>
<P>
   However, the newspaper published a 1971 photo of Miguel Angel
Cavallo and a current photo of Ricardo Miguel Cavallo, pointing out
the similar facial features between two pictures.
</P>
<P>
   It also said Miguel Angel Cavallo often used the alias Ricardo,
and that both the torturer and the man who was arrested Thursday
had used the same identification number.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a result of a great international effort involving
many countries,'' said Adriana Calvo, a member of the Argentine
human rights group Association of the Former Detained and
Disappeared, whose members were among those who identified Ricardo
Miguel Cavallo as a former torturer. ''I can't describe my immense
joy, it's great news. There is one less killer walking free in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a retired army officer wanted for
questioning in the 1976 disappearance of a French woman during
Argentina's military dictatorship was detained in Italy. Jorge
Antonio Olivera is being held in Rome, while officials await word
on a possible French extradition request.

<HEADLINE> Griffey Rests a Day After Argument  </HEADLINE>
By JOE KAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. didn't do anything that could
be questioned Thursday, a day after he bristled at an announcer's
criticism.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Reds manager Jack McKeon gave Griffey a day off as
planned, only his second this season. He watched from the bench as
the Reds beat the Philadelphia Phillies 8-3 Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The day off was unrelated to his blowup with Hall of Fame
announcer Marty Brennaman before the previous night's game. Griffey
repeated Thursday that he doesn't want to be known as someone who
loafs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not some person who wants to be treated as a superstar and
won't go out and help the team,'' Griffey said. ''That's not what I
want to be known as -- a guy who doesn't want to play and is
moody.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennaman declined to comment on the matter Thursday, saying he
was disappointed that his clubhouse disagreement with Griffey had
been reported.
</P>
<P>
   Brennaman, known for his blunt assessments, sharply criticized
Griffey on the air Sunday after he failed to run hard on a single
that might have been stretched to a double. Griffey rarely runs
hard to first base.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about the comment secondhand, Griffey mentioned it
to Brennaman in the clubhouse with reporters but no teammates
present during batting practice Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey suggested he's been bothered by a sore hamstring, but
Brennaman pointed out to him that he's run hard at other times.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation grew heated and included profanities. Brennaman
told Griffey he would continue to criticize him whenever he gave
less than his best effort.
</P>
<P>
   ''The next time you don't run hard to first base, I'll point it
out again,'' Brennaman said.

<HEADLINE> State moves toward installing electronic toll system  </HEADLINE>
By HOLLY RAMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.H. (AP) - Two years from now, New Hampshire motorists
likely will be able to drive along much of the East Coast without
stopping to pay a toll.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Jeanne Shaheen and the Executive Council on Wednesday
unanimously approved a contract that instructs a New York-based
consulting firm to recommend the best way to install an electronic
toll system across the state's highways.
</P>
<P>
   Vollmer Associates, which also has an office in Concord, began
studying the issue for the state in 1997. A year later, the firm
concluded it was feasible for the state to install electronic
tolls, but cautioned that it might not be worth the expense, said
Transportation Commissioner Leon Kenison.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kenison, going ahead then would have been
unsuccessful because only about 15 percent of the state's motorists
likely would have used the system.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's not a very good return on your economic investment, nor
does it relieve the congestion at the tolls,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But with half a dozen states now using compatible systems,
officials estimate more than 50 percent of motorists would find the
system attractive because they could easily travel from one state
to another, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's much like what the credit card industry went through 20
or 25 years ago,'' he said. ''Instead of having a credit card for
four or five banks in town, you have one that works around the
country. ... It's really on our doorstep now. It's been proven.''
</P>
<P>
   The electronic tolls will be activated by a small device located
on a car's dashboard. The toll amount would be deducted from an
account set up by the driver.
</P>
<P>
   Kenison said New Hampshire's electronic toll system would be
compatible with the E-ZPass system used in Massachusetts, New York,
New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and West Virginia,
although it may not be called E-ZPass. The system also is used at
Boston's Tobin Bridge and Logan Airport parking garages, Kenison
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maine installed a similar system three years ago and is
considering an upgrade to the regional system.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you start talking about interstate traffic, particularly
commercial traffic, the ability to stay with the same system
whether you're on the Mass. Pike or Everett Turnpike is very
important,'' said Executive Councilor Peter Spaulding.
</P>
<P>
   Spaulding said beyond decreasing tie-ups at the tolls, the new
system may keep commercial drivers off secondary roads that aren't
built to withstand such traffic. Drivers would be less likely to
take detours to avoid paying tolls, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the company they're driving for, instead of giving them
cash for tolls, installs this device, there might not be that
incentive to use secondary roads,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 7, Expos 0  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chan Ho Park hit his first major league home
run and pitched seven shutout innings, leading the Los Angeles
Dodgers over the Montreal Expos 7-0 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Park added an RBI single while Shawn Green also homered and
Adrian Beltre had three hits and two RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers took three of four from the Expos and won a series
for the first time in six attempts. Montreal lost for the 12th time
in 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Park (13-8) gave up five hits, struck out seven and walked one.
He allowed fewer than three earned runs for the sixth consecutive
start, and escaped a bases-loaded jam in the fifth by striking out
pinch-hitter Fernando Seguignol and Peter Bergeron.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Olson pitched hitless relief for two innings to complete
the shutout. He struck out four.
</P>
<P>
   Park did himself proud with the bat, driving a first-pitch
fastball 427 feet to right-center for a solo homer to open the
scoring in the third. The shot came against Javier Vazquez (8-6).
</P>
<P>
   Park's first homer in 256 major league at-bats came just two
days after teammate Ismael Valdes hit his first homer in 318 career
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger pitchers have hit five home runs this season, the most by
any staff in the majors and one more than San Francisco. Darren
Dreifort has homered three times -- including two in his Aug. 8
victory over Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez gave up five runs and six hits in four innings and
remained winless over his last six starts, including five
no-decisions. It was the right-hander's shortest outing in 26
starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Vazquez, who beat the Dodgers with a one-hitter last Sept. 14 at
Dodger Stadium, surrendered hits to the first four Dodgers in a
four-run fourth inning that increased their lead to 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   Green led off with an opposite-field drive to left-center for
his 23rd homer. Eric Karros singled, took third on Devon White's
single and continued home when the throw to third from right
fielder Wilton Guerrero sailed into the camera well.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero started in place of older brother Vladimir, who missed
his third straight game because of a strained left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre followed with an RBI single, Chad Kreuter walked and Park
capped the rally with an RBI single up the middle. With his two
hits, Park is 13-for-53 this season and has five RBIs.
</P>

Notes: Vazquez's start was his eighth on the road in 10 outings.
He had not allowed a home run in 22 innings since giving up a
season-high three at Houston's hitter-friendly Enron Field on Aug.
4. ... The Dodgers placed OF F.P. Santangelo on the 15-day disabled
list, retroactive to Aug. 23, because of a torn ulnar ligament in
his left thumb. They also purchased the contract of INF Jeff
Branson from Triple-A Albuquerque and made room for him on the
40-man roster by designating RHP Apostol Garcia for assignment.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 38; Nasdaq Gains 42  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A late buying spree Thursday helped push blue
chip stocks to their highest levels since early spring, but
investors generally seemed to lack conviction now that the markets
have emerged from the shadow of potential interest rate hikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, after fluctuating in and out
of positive territory for much of the session, closed up 38.09 at
11,182.74, the Dow's highest close since it reached 11,287.08 on
April 11.
</P>
<P>
   Broader stock indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index was up 2.34 at 1,508.31, and the Nasdaq composite index
was up 42.27 at 4,053.28.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts believe the Federal Reserve Board's decision Tuesday to
leave interest rates alone, and the likelihood that rates will
remain stable for the foreseeable future, have left a vacuum in
terms of providing investors with direction.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a complacent environment. There's not a clearly
defined catalyst for investors to latch onto,'' said Brian Belski,
fundamental market strategist at US Bancorp Piper Jaffray in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, investors will be searching on a daily basis for
some piece of data or news on which to base their trading
decisions, Belski said.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are reluctant to accept the Fed's decision as a
sign that inflation is no longer a concern, a reality that could
serve as an obstacle to the markets returning to their highs of
early spring.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Melcher, president of Balestra Capital Management in New
York, noted that energy costs have surged higher this summer and
represent a signficant increase in the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, U.S. labor markets remain tight, Melcher said,
which will keep wages high and help drive consumer prices higher.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow might have seen higher gains Thursday if not for a
selloff in eyecare company Bausch &AMP; Lomb, which lowered its outlook
for earnings and revenue growth for the rest of the fiscal year and
2001. In addition, the company announced that its president and
chief operating officer will resign.
</P>
<P>
   The Rochester, N.Y., company's stock fell $19.875, or 36
percent, to $35.875.
</P>
<P>
   In economic news, a government report showed durable goods
orders fell by a record 12.4 percent in July, following big gains
in May and June. The figures mean big manufacturers are apparently
tightening their production levels, another sign that the economy
is cooling.
</P>
<P>
   But the report had little obvious impact on the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   So, lacking clear direction, some investors sought safety in
widely held, blue-chip stocks. Dow component General Motors rose
$3.937 at $72.875 and America Online gained $1.875 to $59.875.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors looked for refuge in well known technology
stocks. The Nasdaq was boosted by gains from Yahoo!, up $6 to
$139.813, and eBay, up $3.562 at $61.375.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues narrowly outnumbered decliners by on the New
York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.02 billion
shares, trailing Wednesday's pace of 1.01 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was up 5.42 at 523.30.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.42 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 0.03 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was
down 0.14 percent, and France's CAC-40 was down 0.61 percent.

<HEADLINE> British TV Crew Might Soon Be Freed  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN PAYE-LAYLEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) -- After meeting throughout the day,
defense lawyers reached agreement with the Liberian government
Thurday that could soon lead to the release of a British television
crew detained on espionage charges, a source close to the defense
said.
</P>
<P>
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, declined to
give further details. But an announcement was expected Friday at a
news conference called by the Justice Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   A leading Liberian independent radio station, DC Radio, also
reported that a breakthrough had been made in the case. Government
officials could not immediately be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, a Liberian soccer team said their star, George
Weah, had offered to intervene to help secure the release of the
four-member crew.
</P>
<P>
   The former world player of the year was returning home to appear
for Liberia in a match against Mauritius on Sunday and hoped to
meet President Charles Taylor on Monday to argue the case, said
Chris Bird, chief executive for the Manchester City soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   ''The meeting has not been confirmed yet, but he knows the
president and is obviously a very well-known character in
Liberia,'' Bird said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to try his best to do what he can. He wants to help
the families in what he realizes is an awful situation for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Weah is a major celebrity in Liberia, where he has donated large
amounts of time and money to rebuild the country in the wake of its
devastating seven-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Bail was denied Wednesday for the journalists from London-based
Insight News Television -- two Britons, a South African and a Sierra
Leonean.
</P>
<P>
   The judge said the four could not be granted bail because they
could face the death penalty. But defense attorney Varney Sherman
said the most the journalists could get is 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists who were working on a documentary film were
arrested Friday at their hotel in Monrovia, capital of Liberia, and
they were charged Monday. They had been in Liberia three weeks when
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. State Department Spokesman Richard Boucher
strongly condemned the arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''Indeed, there appears to be no basis for charges of espionage
that have been leveled against them. We see a free press as a
fundamental component of a free society, a core tenet of
international human rights law, and we call on the government of
Liberia to release the four journalists immediately and
unconditionally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charging the four said the government believes
the documentary they were working on would try to support British
and American allegations of Liberian government involvement in
diamond smuggling and gun running for neighboring Sierra Leone's
brutal rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   The detained journalists are award-winning Sierra Leonean
journalist Sorious Samura; British director David Barrie; British
cameraman Tim Lambon, and South African cameraman Gugu Radebe.
Samura has been honored for his film ''Cry Freetown'' about the
1999 invasion of the Sierra Leonean capital.

<HEADLINE> Transplants Show Promise for Lupus  </HEADLINE>
By EMMA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- New research bolsters the hope that doctors might
one day be able to use bone marrow transplants to cure autoimmune
diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and
lupus.
</P>
<P>
   A few people with autoimmune diseases -- where the immune system
goes awry and attacks the body -- already have been injected with
their own immature blood cells, called stem cells. The results have
been promising, with some remaining in remission, but researchers
have not tracked many people for very long.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary study of seven people very sick with systemic
lupus, reported in The Lancet medical journal this week, found that
the transplanted blood cells appeared to have dominated renegade
immune cells in all the patients and repaired organ damage
previously considered permanent.
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell if the therapy has cured them of the
potentially fatal illness, but all the patients are now healthy
about three years after getting the treatment, said the
researchers, from Northwestern University School of Medicine in
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the best report I've heard so far, and it looks very
promising for those autoimmune diseases that are life-threatening
or managed at large cost,'' said Dr. Noel Rose, a leading
researcher of autoimmune diseases at Johns Hopkins University
School of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow transplants carry a high risk of deadly infections
and thus would be appropriate only as a last resort for people
whose diseases have not responded to other treatments, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   The latest research ''is clearly defining transplant as a
therapy that can provide at least short-term, if not lifelong,
relief'' for patients who have exhausted all other options, said
Dr. Theodore Moore, director of the pediatric stem cell transplant
program at Doernbecher Children's Hospital at Oregon Health
Sciences University. He was not connected with the study.
</P>
<P>
   Bone marrow transplants traditionally are performed to fight
cancer or to correct rare genetic defects. Some cancer patients
also get relief from autoimmune diseases they are suffering, a
bonus that prompted scientists to investigate transplants for those
illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Stem cells -- free-agent immature cells that can go on to become
any cell type in the body -- are stored in various organs and grow
into the specific types of cells needed by those organs.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists hope that by removing stem cells from the bone marrow
of people with immune system diseases then injecting it back into
their blood, the new cells will grow into healthy immune cells and
dominate the misguided ones, fixing the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, the extracted bone marrow was filtered to
eliminate any old, defective cells. After the purified stem cells
were injected into the blood, the patients were given drugs to kill
off the aberrant cells and silence those left over so the new ones
could mature without their influence.
</P>
<P>
   Rose noted it is mysterious that the transplanted cells, which
have the same genetic defect that made the patients' immune cells
go wrong in the first place, did not grow up to repeat the mistakes
of their siblings.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is curious that it works at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study's leader, Dr. Ann Traynor, a blood and cancer
professor at Northwestern, said she believed the new cells were
able to take over the immune system and were probably suppressing
the influence of the renegade cells -- in effect erasing the memory
of the immune system and starting fresh.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've actually reversed their organ disfunction. Lung
function is completely normal, they are repairing the kidney
function, blood toxins are down. ... They are all normal now,''
Traynor said. ''They don't get infections now any more than you or
I.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one part of the whole excitement of the growing
technology of stem cells to reverse disease,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the effect doesn't turn out to be permanent, experts say
it would be worthwhile to give patients a normal life for a few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Autoimmune disease is now the third major category of illness in
many industrialized countries, behind heart disease and cancer,
experts say. Some patients have mild cases of autoimmune diseases,
while others have sporadic flare-ups. Some face a lifetime of
misery.
</P>
<P>
   Systemic lupus is incurable and can be fatal. The immune system
attacks several organs, which can cause arthritis, kidney failure,
brain disease and inflammation of the lining of the lungs and the
membrane surrounding the heart. It affects about nine times as many
women as men.

<HEADLINE> Honeywell seeks buyer for automotive product line  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Honeywell International Inc.
announced Thursday it is seeking a buyer for its automotive
products unit, which sells brands including Prestone
antifreeze-coolant, Autolite spark plugs, Fram filters, and Holts
car care products.
</P>
<P>
   The unit is the latest put on the block by Honeywell as it
continues its plan to divest noncore businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a focus effort,'' said Howard Rubel, an analyst
who follows Honeywell for Goldman Sachs. ''The company's view is
that it can be good in a lot of areas, but it can be great in
some.''
</P>
<P>
   The car products are made by Honeywell's Consumer Products
Group, headquartered in Danbury, Conn., which generated about $1.1
billion in net sales in 1999, up 6 percent from the prior year.
</P>
<P>
   The unit has 4,400 employees and 17 manufacturing locations
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''As promised, we are moving swiftly to focus our resources and
reconfigure our portfolio to maximize its potential, while
increasing the value-creation capabilities of our strong core
businesses,'' said Michael R. Bonsignore, Honeywell chairman and
CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Honeywell, down 4 percent in regular trading, jumped
9.4 percent, or $3.437, to $40 in after-hours trading on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Products Group has four major business enterprises:
Prestone, Fram, Autolite, and Holts, making branded goods for
aftermarket consumers, as well as for original equipment
manufacturers and installers.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these brands is over 60 years old, Honeywell said.
</P>
<P>
   Holt Lloyd is a European and Asian supplier of car care products
sold under the Holts, Redex, Simoniz, and Start Pilote brand.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell recently announced its plans to sell a chlor-alkali
chemical manufacturing unit in the third quarter. The plant, in
Regalwood, N.C., produces chlorine and caustics used for a variety
of industrial applications and employs 165 workers.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to sell a pharmaceutical chemical business, which
is located in Morristown, that employs 500 workers.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Honeywell said it plans to sell its U.S. security
monitoring business that serves homes and small businesses, which
employs 230 people in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area. That business
has annual sales of $270 million and 1,400 employees at 62
locations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Salomon Smith Barney has been retained to help Honeywell find a
buyer for its Consumer Products Group.
</P>
<P>
   Honeywell merged with AlliedSignal last year and moved its
headquarters from Minneapolis to Morristown, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   It has about $24 billion in annual sales in businesses including
aerospace products; control technologies for buildings, home and
industry; power generation systems; specialty chemicals; fibers;
plastics; and electronic and advanced materials.

<HEADLINE> Police nab underground marijuana farm  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ADDISON, N.Y. (AP) - Police on Thursday charged two men with
operating a 3,200-square-foot underground farm that produced 12
pounds of marijuana every week.
</P>
<P>
   After an 18-month investigation, local, state and federal agents
raided Roger S. Spencer's barn in this town 75 miles southeast of
Rochester, uncovering the sophisticated growing operation he built
under his barn.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Spencer, 39, and Andrew C. Hurd, 34, used generators
to power 32 high pressure sodium lights - at 1,000 watts each - and
air conditioners in the underground garden, creating a climate and
light controlled atmosphere. Each pound of marijuana was worth
$3,200 on the street, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were charged with first-degree criminal possession of
marijuana. More state and federal charges are pending.
</P>
<P>
   Police from Corning, the Steuben County Sheriff's Department,
New York and Pennsylvania state police, Federal Bureau of
Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration participated in
the investigation and arrests.

<HEADLINE> Mallon Shoots Record 62  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- So much for the ill effects of jet
lag.
</P>
<P>
   Meg Mallon, still a bit groggy after her trip from the Women's
British Open, tied her personal best and set a tournament record
Thursday with a 10-under-par 62 in the first round of the
Oldsmobile Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, who shared the previous record of 63 with four others,
had bogey-free nines of 31 and 31 on her way to a two-stroke lead
over Michelle McGann, seeking her first win since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Karrie Webb, who has two majors among her five tour wins this
season, shot a 66 to match Tracy Hanson, Jenny Lidback and Mitzi
Edge.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jennifer Rosales was another shot back at 67.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess you could say I was in a zone out there,'' said
Mallon, who won the du Maurier -- the season's final major -- before
heading to England last week. ''Everything is very clear in your
head. There could be a freight train running through it, and you
wouldn't notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon and Webb played in the morning. McGann, who won this
tournament in 1996, played in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Meg likes this course, too,'' said McGann, who also played in
England last week. ''It doesn't surprise me. But, remember, it's
only Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, who grew up in the Detroit suburb of Birmingham, was
cheered by a sizable following of family and friends all the way
around the 6,241-yard layout at Walnut Hills Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw a lot of familiar faces,'' Mallon said. ''Even some from
high school. It was nice to give them something to cheer about.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't have to wait long.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, who needed only 23 putts, set the tone on the 373-yard
1st hole, where she was forced to run in a 15-foot putt to save
par. She knew from that point on that she had the greens figured
right.
</P>
<P>
   ''The putt on one was the turning point of the day,'' Mallon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But she helped her cause considerably by pitching in from
95 yards for an eagle at the par-5 6th hole. She also chipped in
from 25 feet for birdie at the par-3 13th.
</P>
<P>
   ''Playing at Royal Birkdale last week, you had to hit so many
different golf shots over there,'' Mallon said. ''Coming back here,
I felt like I was a better golfer.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't Mallon's first 62, but it was probably her best.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had another 62 in Myrtle Beach a few years ago,'' Mallon
said. ''But I bogeyed the last hole to shoot 62, so it was nice to
birdie the last one here.''
</P>
<P>
   McGann eagled No. 14, a 440-yard hole the women play as a par 5.
She also managed to save par with a 10-foot putt after driving into
the water on the sixth hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been taking some inspiration from watching Tiger Woods,''
McGann said. ''He's not knocking everything stiff. You know, when
you make a bad shot, you have to recover from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, who had complained about jet lag after playing in
Wednesday's pro-am event, said she was able to sleep well the night
before her opening round.
</P>
<P>
   ''I slept through most of the night,'' Webb said. ''I missed the
end of ''Survivor.'' I was trying to stay awake, but I just
couldn't. So, I'm getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mallon and Webb, who between them have won three of the
season's four majors, headlining the field, it's possible that many
tournament records could fall this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Daniel and defending champion Dottie Pepper -- out this week
with a back injury -- share the 36-hole record at 14-under 130. Lisa
Walters was at 199 after three rounds in 1998, on her way to
winning with a tournament-record 23-under 265.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, who shot a final-round 63 in 1996, might easily reach
that figure.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this time, it might not be good enough to win. Not with
McGann and Webb lurking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Karrie is a great player and she has a great game,'' Mallon
said. ''She's very aggressive. I know she'll come out with full
guns (on Friday). It will be interesting to see how we both
react.''

<HEADLINE> Leonard Left Off U.S. Team  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Justin Leonard, who holed that 45-foot birdie
putt that clinched America's comeback victory in the Ryder Cup,
thought he had a decent chance at making the Presidents Cup as a
captain's pick.
</P>
<P>
   But he had no problems being left off a U.S. team for the first
time since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Venturi used his two selections on Loren Roberts, 11th in
the standings, and Paul Azinger, the surprise pick at No. 24.
Leonard agreed with both picks.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's pretty hard to question that,'' he said. ''If I had been
picked, I think it would have been fine, too. I was in position to
make the team this year, and I just haven't played well. There's no
sour grapes. I just should have played better.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonard was a runner-up in consecutive weeks at the Memorial and
the Kemper, but he hasn't finished higher than 15th the rest of the
year. His play has been so bad that Leonard said he wasn't using
the Presidents Cup as motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ''My main focus was to play better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard has played on every Presidents Cup and Ryder Cup team
since 1996, although he has yet to win a singles match outright.
Despite the cup-clinching putt on the 17th at The Country Club, he
still wound up with a halve against Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   NOT IN THE CARDS: Tiger Woods was 7 under through 12 holes and
needed only four birdies over the final six to shoot a 59. He says
the thought never entered his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just trying to put the ball in the fairway,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His 64 was his lowest first-round score since a 61 in the 1999
Byron Nelson Classic. Even then, Woods said he never thought about
golf's magic number. He has done it once, in a friendly match with
Mark O'Meara before the 1997 Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I have gotten off to great starts, I have never
once considered shooting that number,'' he said. ''Even the day I
shot 59, I was 10 under through nine holes in one stretch, and it
did not enter my mind. I just wanted to continue playing well and
get Mark's money.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   FAVORING FIRESTONE: How good is Firestone Country Club? Jim
Furyk loves the place, and he has never played particularly well on
it.
</P>
<P>
   Firestone has been part of the PGA Tour since 1954. But in 2002,
its only significant tournament will be the PGA Seniors
Championship, because the NEC Invitational will be played at
Sahalee outside Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to see as many tournaments here as possible,'' Furyk
said. ''And you're looking at a guy who has not played well here
before -- so I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   If Furyk could choose where to play big tournaments, he would go
with Las Vegas, where he has won the past two years.

living, share something else in common. Both won tournaments by
beating Tiger Woods down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke beat Woods head-to-head in the Match Play Championship
finals at La Costa. Westwood came from behind and beat him in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   How much that means depends on the player.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, who has gotten to know Woods through swing coach Butch
Harmon, said he left Woods a message on his answering machine after
the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   ''The better you play, the better it's make me look,'' he told
him. ''So keep on going.''
</P>
<P>
   Westwood, however, seemed indifferent about ending Woods
four-year streak of protecting 54-hole leads.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know if I play my best, I'm capable of beating him,''
Westwood said. ''I've proved it to all of you, or anybody else who
is looking into it and thinking about it. There's no edge to
that.''

<HEADLINE> Indians Recall Infielder McDonald  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians, forced to use 52 players
this season because of injuries, recalled infielder John McDonald
from Triple-A Buffalo on Thursday and sent utilityman Chan Perry
back to the Bisons.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald, who appeared in 18 games for the Indians last season,
was batting .269 with 17 doubles, two triples and 36 RBIs in 75
games at Buffalo. A smooth fielder, he also hit .382 with runners
in scoring position and .331 with runners on base.
</P>
<P>
   When McDonald appears in a game this season, Cleveland will
match a club record by using 53 players this season. The Indians
also used 53 players in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Perry went 1-for-6 in six games for the Indians. He was batting
.306 with eight homers and 56 RBIs for the Bisons before being
called up.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also signed Sean Berry, who batted .152 in 32 games
for Milwaukee this season, to a minor league contract and assigned
him to Triple-A Buffalo. Berry has played for Kansas City,
Montreal, Houston and the Brewers.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept Seeks Carnivore Review  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department formally asked outside
technical experts Thursday to review whether the FBI's
''Carnivore'' e-mail surveillance system has adequate protections
against abuse.
</P>
<P>
   The department posted a 63-page description of the technical
review on its website for bids by outside contractors. It hopes a
major university will undertake and complete the task this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The technical review, to be followed by public comment and an
internal Justice Department review, is designed to present Attorney
General Janet Reno with recommendations by Dec. 8 on how to respond
to criticism of the system from Congress and privacy advocates.
</P>
<P>
   David Sobel, counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a civil liberties group, said that, while the review would
be ''a good exercise to add to the knowledge about Carnivore, this
review will not be able to resolve all the questions, either
technical or legal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carnivore system, installed by the FBI on the network of
Internet service providers, has software that scans Internet
traffic as it moves through that provider's network. The FBI says
it configures the software to capture e-mail to or from someone
under investigation and that court orders limit which e-mails
agents can see.
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates say only the FBI knows what Carnivore can
do, and Internet providers are not allowed access to the system.
They ask why the FBI retains remote control of Carnivore equipment
and doesn't just give it to Internet providers so they can comply
with court orders.
</P>
<P>
   The government's review description said it wants to know:
</P>
<P>
   -- If the operators obey the law, will Carnivore provide agents
with all the information they ought to see, but only that
information?
</P>
<P>
   -- Will Carnivore risk harming an internet service provider's
network?
</P>
<P>
   -- Does Carnivore introduce new risks that FBI agents or others
will gain intentional or unintentional access to electronic
communications they have no right to see?
</P>
<P>
   -- Are Carnivore's operational procedures and built-in
protections adequate to prevent such unauthorized access?
</P>
<P>
   Sobel said those questions ''underscore the other question: Why
is the government refusing to suspend use pending review when there
are all these serious about its use? It seems irresponsible to keep
using a system that raises this many questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General Steve Colgate, head of the internal
review team, said the system remains in operation, under court
orders and general oversight by Justice Department lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, FBI officials told Congress that Carnivore has been
used 25 times, including in 10 national security and six domestic
criminal cases this year. None of the cases has gone to trial, so
the FBI has not disclosed details.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective contractors were asked to submit proposals by Sept.
6. Reno will pick one by Sept. 15. The contract is to be awarded
Sept. 25. A report is due by Nov. 17. And a final version of the
report, incorporating public comment, is due Dec. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel noted, however, that the entire technical review will not
be made public for comment. ''There's a real question how much the
public will see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The department said that as much of the report would be released
as possible, but not trade secrets of the contractors who developed
it or anything that would undermine ''the effectiveness of
Carnivore as a tool'' for law enforcement.

<HEADLINE> Four Advance at U.S. Amateur Golf  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPRINGFIELD, N.J. (AP) -- Two players looking to set age records
and two Englishmen trying to end a long foreign drought advanced to
the quarterfinals of the 100th U.S. Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter Mahan, 18, of McKinney, Texas, and reinstated amateur
David Eger, 48, of Ponte Vedra, Fla., each won two matches Thursday
to move closer to the USGA record book on a day when age and
nationality were the hot topics.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Mahan, the 1999 U.S. Junior Amateur champ, reach
the final eight, but so did three 40-year-olds -- Gary Wolstenholme
of England, Jerry Courville of Milford, Conn., and Eger, looking to
become the oldest winner at 48 years, 5 months.
</P>
<P>
   The final four spots were grabbed by outstanding college players
-- three-time All-America Bryce Molder of Georgia Tech; 1999 NCAA
champion Luke Donald, the Englishman playing at Northwestern; James
Driscoll of Virginia; and Jeff Quinney of Arizona State
</P>
<P>
   Quinney of Eugene, Ore., won the 17th and 18th holes with a
birdie and a par and then rolled in a par putt at the 23rd hole to
beat Ben Curtis, the Kent State player who lost in the semifinals
last year to eventual winner David Gossett.
</P>
<P>
   Eger will play Wolstenholme, Mahan will face Quinney, Donald
will go against Molder, and Courville will play Driscoll in
Friday's quarters on the Upper Course at Baltusrol Golf Club.
</P>
<P>
   Mahan (18 years, 3 months) is trying to replace Tigers Woods (18
years, 7 months) as the Amateur's youngest winner. The McKinney,
Texas, resident who will be a freshman at Southern California
opened a 5-up lead in his third-round match en route to a 3-and-2
win over Judd McLuen of Colbert, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I could play well, but I really didn't know the
course,'' said Mahan, who took up golf at 10. ''It's hard to tell
how you are going to do because you never know who you are going to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Eger, who works as a golf consultant, played two tough matches,
beating Mid-Amateur champion Danny Green 3 and 1 in the second
round, and co-medalist Jim Salinetti on the 19th hole in the third
round
</P>
<P>
   Salinetti, the recent Rhode Island graduate who intends to turn
pro, missed a 4-foot par putt to stay in the match.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came in thinking I just want to qualify for match play,''
said Eger, the 1988 Mid-Amateur champion. ''Maybe that's not the
right attitude to take. But I haven't gotten in the drill yet to
psyching myself into something. If I play better that might
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest Amateur winner is Jack Westland, who was 47 years, 3
months when he won in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   Wolstenholme, the last player to beat Woods as an amateur in
match play, and Donald are looking to break even a longer streak.
</P>
<P>
   While Gary Cowan of Canada was the last foreign winner of the
Amateur in 1971, a non North American hasn't won since Harold H.
Hilton did it in 1911.
</P>
<P>
   ''Luke, I think he is looking awfully good,'' Wolstenholme said
after beating Nathan Smith of Brookville, Pa. 2 and 1 in the third
round. ''But obviously I'm plugging away and I have a tough match
with David. It's nice to see there are some 40-year-olds in the
shake. That's what it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   Donald hit nothing but greens and fairways all day in beating
Andy Miller, the son of television golf analyst Johnny Miller in
the morning, and then fellow British Walker Cupper David Patrick in
the afternoon by 5-and-3 scores.
</P>
<P>
   Donald did not make a bogey in playing 30 holes in 7 under.
</P>
<P>
   ''He got me in Nairn, so I'm kind of looking to get him back,''
Molder said referring to a Walker Cup loss to Donald last year.
</P>
<P>
   Molder, who is considered college golf's top player with Donald,
did Georgia Tech proud, beating two players from Georgia. He beat
Bryant Odom 3 and 2 in the morning and then knocked off David
Miller 1-up.
</P>
<P>
   Courville, who beat veteran Tom McKnight in the morning, made an
8-foot putt on the final hole to score a 1-up win in the afternoon
over Bob Gregorski, a Cato, Wis., attorney who carried his own golf
bag for the entire tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll, also a quarterfinalist last year, had three birdies on
the back nine in beating 42-year-old flooring contractor Richard
Smith of Dresden, Tenn., 5 and 3.

<HEADLINE> Israel Wants To Add to Peace Talks  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel wants to put on paper the gains made at
U.S.-sponsored peace talks, a top negotiator said Thursday, in a
reversal of his country's previous declaration that all
breakthroughs from the talks were ''null and void.''
</P>
<P>
   Shlomo Ben-Ami, the acting foreign minister, suggested that
Israel was especially interested in setting down in writing the
taboo-breaking proposals the sides arrived at on sharing the walled
Old City of Jerusalem and its Muslim and Jewish holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   Describing talks with U.S. mediator Dennis Ross aimed at
reconvening a summit, Ben Ami said Israel's ''aspiration is to try
and produce a collective paper to express what the parties
understand is the product of Camp David on some core issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian officials said that they are not working on such a
document with the Israelis. The officials, insisting on anonymity,
said they are compiling the ideas that were discussed at Camp
David, but not in the form of an agreed document at this point.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of a collective paper was a turnabout from Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's declaration that all Camp David proposals were ''null
and void'' after the summit's collapse last month. Barak had even
refused to allow minutes to be taken at meetings he attended during
the 15-day summit at the presidential retreat in the Maryland
hills.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Barak, who had made deep concessions on Jerusalem
and Palestinian refugees at the summit, saw the summit as played
out and was seeking to entice hard-line parties back into his
disintegrating government.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts have so far failed, and Barak has returned to
espousing some of the far-reaching proposals. Now he says he will
bypass parliament and take any agreement with the Palestinians to
the people, either through a referendum or through new elections.
</P>
<P>
   Barak wants a deal by the time parliament reconvenes in October,
when the opposition will step up its efforts to topple his
government. On Thursday he warned the Palestinians he would abandon
peace efforts and invite hard-liners into his government if there
is no deal by then.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ami made his comments upon returning from Egypt, where he
met with President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must work on the basis of what was created at Camp David,
and not to return to square one,'' Ben-Ami said he told the
Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   Israel wants the Egyptians to lead an Arab initiative that would
reassure Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat of Arab backing on any
compromise he makes on control over Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ami said Jerusalem was one of the ''main issues'' in his
meetings Thursday with the Egyptians.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Israel agreed to extend limited sovereignty to
the Palestinians in some parts of the city -- but did not go far
enough for Arafat, who seeks all of traditionally Arab East
Jerusalem, including the walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Barak offered the Palestinians religious sovereignty on Haram
as-Sharif, the mosque compound built on the remnants of the Jewish
temple destroyed 2,000 years ago, and abutting the Western Wall --
the holiest site in Judaism -- but insisted on overall Israeli
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Haram as-Sharif is the third-holiest site in Islam, and were
Arafat to accept anything less than total sovereignty, he would be
shunned throughout much of the Muslim world.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Ami said he told his Egyptian hosts that, ''just as we
recognize and are sensitive to the practical and symbolic
expressions of the relation of Islam to Jewish places in Jerusalem,
to the same measure and with special passion we are sensitive to
defend the values, the symbols, the principles of Judaism in the
holy city.''
</P>
<P>
   Such language -- placing the importance of the Old City to
Muslims on equal footing with its holiness to Jews -- is
unprecedented for so senior an Israeli official and could signal an
offer to allow some form of sovereignty to the Palestinians in the
Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Channel Two television, citing unidentified officials, said Ben
Ami told the Egyptians Israel would extend sovereignty to the
Palestinians in some ''buildings'' in the Old City -- it was not
clear where. That would go beyond anything Israel offered at Camp
David.

<HEADLINE> Madonna wants her name back from pornographer  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) - Pop star Madonna has lodged a complaint with the
United Nations to gain control of the Internet domain name
madonna.com.
</P>
<P>
   She has asked the World Intellectual Property Organization to
order the handover of the site, which is owned by New Jersey
entrepreneur Dan Parisi, who runs a successful pornography site.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can register a domain name for a few dollars, which has
led so-called ''cybersquatters'' to file for famous names in order
to make a fast buck from those who want the names. Some internet
domain names are worth millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   The WIPO system allows those who think they have the real right
to a domain to get it back without having to fight a costly legal
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Parisi, who previously used the website for pornographic
material but has now removed it, claims that Madonna, whose full
name is Madonna Ciccone, has no more right to the domain name than
anyone else with the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ''She was named after the Virgin Mary as was her mother and
hundreds of thousands of other people throughout the world over the
past 2,000 years,'' he said in a statement on the website.
</P>
<P>
   ''We do not believe that because Ms. Ciccone named her act after
the Virgin Mary that gives her the right to stop any other party
from using the word 'madonna' as a title of their website.''
</P>
<P>
   Parisi fought a long legal battle to hold on to another web
address - a pornographic pay site at a Web address similar to the
official one for the White House.
</P>
<P>
   He claims he plans to hand the madonna.com address over to the
Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital in Lincoln, Nebraska, which already
has the name madonna.org.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case is about whether big business has the right to claim
exclusive ownership of common words in the English Language and to
take them out of the public domain,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Madonna's publicist, Liz Rosenberg, said she thought the singer
had every right to fight for the domain name.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is my understanding that the person who was the
cybersquatter used her name for a pornographic site, so I think
Madonna probably has quite a good chance,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenberg rejected the suggestion that Madonna had no more right
to the site than anyone else of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   ''She happens to be the most famous Madonna in the world, so I
think she certainly has every right to try to protect a website
called Madonna,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The WIPO arbitrator is due to rule on the dispute about Sept.
16. A number of celebrities have already won back their names
through the process, including actress Julia Roberts and comedienne
Rita Rudner.
</P>
<P>
   However, others have been less successful. The singer Sting was
denied transfer of the name sting.com on the grounds that it was
not his real name and was a common English word.
</P>
<P>
   Other disputes over celebrity names waiting to be settled
include jeanpaulgaultier.com, isabelle-adjani.net and
alaindelon.com. Eight Dutch soccer players, including Frank de Boer
and Jaap Stam have also filed complaints about the use of their
names.

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Finale Dominates Ratings  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Survivor,'' which dominated ratings and
pop-culture discourse, has changed the face of summer programming
and breathed new life into network broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, NBC and CBS have long hung out a ''gone fishing'' sign
during the hot weather months. Then ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' scored with viewers last summer on ABC, and CBS'
''Survivor'' picked up the tiki torch and ran with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summer is no longer the repeat season,'' said Stacey Lynn
Koerner of TN Media in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox has tried out new midyear programming for a decade,
she said, viewers weren't conditioned to tune in, and the big three
networks didn't follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   When wily Richard Hatch was selected by his fellow ''Survivor''
castaways as the $1 million prize winner Wednesday night, 51.7
million viewers were watching.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor's'' 28.6 rating and 45 share of those watching TV
during the period was far from the 60.2 rating and 77 share for
TV's all-time leader, the ''M A S H'' finale in 1983. But the
performance was extraordinary in this age of multiple cable and
satellite options.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night was one of the most successful nights in the
network's history,'' CBS spokesman Chris Ender crowed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The network hopes to relive the experience with a ''Survivor''
repeat in September and ''Survivor II: The Australian Outback,''
debuting after the Super Bowl on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Copycats are lining up. A slew of reality series are in the
works, including ABC's ''The Chase'' and ''The Mole'' and possible
NBC contender ''Chains of Love,'' about a woman chained to four
prospective boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   When about 75 million people tuned in for the ''Seinfeld''
finale in 1998, observers said it might represent the last hurrah
for broadcast TV. They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' reaffirmed broadcasting's ability to create a
shared water-cooler experience in a high-tech world in which people
find contact increasingly elusive.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of television's early history in 1948, when
Milton Berle's ''Texaco Star Theater'' would score ratings as high
as 80, as people gathered in the homes of friends with televisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are very few opportunities for people to experience the
same event all at the same time and be able to talk about it day in
and day out,'' Koerner said. ''People are looking to be
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition, not connection, was the rule on ''Survivor,'' which
dropped 16 people on a Malaysian island for 39 days and dangled a
million bucks in front of them. Hatch proved the master of the
island domain, outlasting finalists Susan Hawk, Rudy Boesch and
Kelly Wiglesworth.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone news conference Thursday, a relaxed-sounding
Hatch, who orchestrated an alliance that helped seal his victory,
said he wasn't concerned that some viewers saw him as a conniving
villain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not who I am, and I'm really comfortable with how I
played the game,'' he said. ''It was a game, a really, really fun
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old corporate trainer, who's gay, said he's glad to
serve as a role model. The one-time 360-pounder from Middletown,
R.I., who has dropped more than 100 pounds also shared his diet
tips, revealed he had a post-island tummy tuck and said he's single
but eager to date.

<HEADLINE> American Priest Found Dead in Kenya  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE MWANGI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- An outspoken American priest who was
critical of the Kenyan government's human rights record was found
shot to death Thursday in western Kenya, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the Rev. John Kaiser, a Minnesota native who has
worked in Kenya for 36 years, was found lying beside a road near
Naivasha, 50 miles northwest of the capital Nairobi, police
spokesman Peter Kimanthi said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The body had a bullet wound on the head. A shotgun was found
at the scene near the body,'' Kimanthi said.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser, 67, a member of the Society of St. Joseph, also known as
the Mill Hill Fathers, was threatened with deportation in November
after the immigration department refused to issue him a work
permit.
</P>
<P>
   The government agreed to renew the work permit, normally routine
for foreign priests working in Kenya, after the Roman Catholic
church and civil rights groups accused the government of trying to
silence the priest, a well-known human rights advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Peter Kairo of Nakuru told the Italian-based missionary
news service MISNA he got an anonymous call Thursday morning saying
Kaiser had been shot. Kairo said he went to the scene and found
Kaiser dead on the pavement by his car, a gun nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow priests told MISNA that the night before, Kaiser was in
his missionary order's house in Nairobi and was ''visibly upset and
nervous and saying he feared for his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Giulio Albanese, a MISNA official in Rome, noted the
slaying came after another Catholic cleric, a local parish priest,
delivered a sermon sharply criticizing the government at a holiday
ceremony attended by President Daniel arap Moi in Nairobi on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling among colleagues was that ''this may have been an answer
to that sermon,'' Albanese said.
</P>
<P>
   Since arriving in the East African country more than three
decades ago, Kaiser worked in the densely populated diocese of
Kisii, as well as the diocese of Ngong. Fluent in Kiswahili and
other African languages, he has been deeply involved in community
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying before a special government commission earlier last
year, Kaiser accused two Cabinet ministers of fomenting tribal
clashes and seizing land vacated during the fighting, which broke
out before the 1992 multiparty elections.
</P>
<P>
   His sister, Carolita Mahoney of Underwood, Minn., said the
Kenyan Law Society had given him their highest humanitarian award.
</P>
<P>
   She also said that he had testified against a district official
accused of rape. His high profile brought death threats, but in a
way he also had felt protected by it, she said. ''He was in all the
Kenyan newspapers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was very upstanding, a man who stood for justice,'' Brother
Alfons Borgman, a member of the Mill Hill Fathers, told The
Associated Press. ''You could say he was a no-nonsense man.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was always a parish priest. For him that meant building and
working for peace and justice. He was very much with all the
people. ... He was Kenyan with the Kenyans,'' Borgman said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy spokesman Tom Hart said Kenyan police had promised
a full investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser was born in Perham, Minn., and raised in Underwood,
Minn., He attended St. John's University in Collegeville, Minn.,
and in 1954 enlisted in the Army and became a paratrooper,
achieving the rank of sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, he graduated from St. Louis University in St. Louis,
Mo., and later studied philosophy and theology at St. Joseph's
Seminary in Mill Hill, England.
</P>
<P>
   His sister described him as a gifted speaker, tall and athletic,
a former wrestling champion and pole vaulter.
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother did not enter the priesthood right away,
bypassing the large Benedictine monastery at St. John's. ''He
always had this calling, this longing, to be a priest, even though
I think he tried to fight it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said he later visited St. John's again, where he met an
elderly missionary priest from the Mill Hill order and decided that
was the place for him.
</P>
<P>
   ''John has always had a great regard for the welfare of people,
especially the poor. He's dedicated his life to that,'' Mahoney
said. ''He's had a commitment to God. Whatever he did, it was done
first out of love for God and secondly out of love for humans.''

<HEADLINE> US Hopes For Positive Mideast Talks  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY DUNPHY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The United States hopes that representatives
of a committee to protect the Arab and Muslim character of
Jerusalem will do nothing to derail negotiations between Israel and
the Palestinians over the future of the city, a senior Clinton
administration official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Moroccan King Mohammed VI will preside over a meeting Monday of
the Al Qods Committee of the 53-nation Organization of the Islamic
Conference, Moroccan diplomats have confirmed. Al Qods is the
Arabic name for Jerusalem, which both the Palestinians and Israelis
claim as their capital.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope the Jerusalem committee will do nothing that will
create a significant roadblock because of the sensitivity of the
negotiations,'' said the official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hope is that they will do the opposite, be constructive in
their approach and add to the positive environment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The official declined to say what constructive steps the
committee should take but stressed the need to ''give the maximum
amount of freedom to the parties involved'' to come up with a
solution to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Morocco presides over the 16-nation committee, which was formed
in 1976. Its members are Bangladesh, Egypt, Guinea, Iraq, Iran,
Indonesia, Jordan, Lebanon, Mauritania, Morocco, Niger, the
Palestinian Authority, Pakistan, Syria, Senegal and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Secretary of State Edward Walker briefed reporters on
his 14-nation trip to the Middle East earlier this month to report
to Arab leaders on the unsuccessful 15-days of talks the Israelis
and the Palestinians held at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   He said he found ''intense interest in President Clinton's firm
intention to continue'' Israeli-Palestinian negotiations ''and, if
at all possible, to reach an agreement on the key issues separating
the parties within the next few weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said he was gratified by the indications of support he
received from Arab leaders ''and a general willingness to consider
alternative solutions to the core Jerusalem problem, despite its
complexity and sensitivity.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said since the end of the Camp David talks Egypt, Jordan
and Morocco had taken concrete steps to help resolve the
outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp David, Israel broke a taboo by agreeing to extend
limited sovereignty to the Palestinians in some parts of the city --
but did not go far enough for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who
seeks all of traditionally Arab East Jerusalem, including the
walled Old City.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis offered the Palestinians religious sovereignty on
Haram as-Sharif, the mosque compound built on the remnants of the
holy Jewish temple destroyed 2,000 years ago, and abutting the
Western Wall -- the holiest site in Judaism -- but insisted on
overall sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Mediate Returns To Action With a 68  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Rocco Mediate got off to a good start as he
recovers from the accident that forced him to withdraw from last
week's PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   A chair collapsed under him before the first round last week at
Valhalla Golf Club, an accident he said couldn't have come at a
worse time.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a freaky thing,'' Mediate said Thursday after shooting
a 4-under-par 68 in the opening round of the Reno-Tahoe Open.
</P>
<P>
   He said his neck and shoulder are still sore, but Nevada's warm
weather made it possible for him to play as well as he did.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate went to sit on the patio outside Valhalla's clubhouse
last week when the wooden folding chair caved in, injuring his
right wrist, right shoulder, neck and lower back.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right when my butt hit the seat, my butt hit the ground. It
scares the hell out of you,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mediate was coming off a victory in the Buick Open that had
moved him up to 15th in the Presidents Cup standings. He had been
hoping a top-10 finish at the PGA would have been enough for him to
win a place on the team for the first time and qualify him for the
$5 million NEC Invitational this week.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he's in Reno with the rest of the PGA Tour players who
didn't qualify for this week's world competition at Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''It didn't cost me my career, but it did cost me a very, very
important week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Glenn Cohen, said Tuesday, ''It remains to be seen
how we're going to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mediate had to miss most of the 1994 season with a ruptured
disc, required a special medical exemption to play two years later
and has been steadily improving. Along with his victory in the
Buick, he defeated Tiger Woods to win the Phoenix Open last year.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had a good round Thursday at the 7,552-yard Montreux
Golf and Country Club -- the second longest on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ''I drove it well. I had some good iron shots in close and made
five birdies,'' Mediate said. ''But I made a stupid bogey on a
par-5. I should be slapped.''

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' success proves network television can survive  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN ELBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) - ''Survivor,'' which dominated ratings and
pop-culture discourse, has changed the face of summer programming
and breathed new life into network broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, NBC and CBS have long hung out a ''gone fishing'' sign
during the hot weather months. Then ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire'' scored with viewers last summer on ABC, and CBS'
''Survivor'' picked up the tiki torch and ran with it.
</P>
<P>
   ''The summer is no longer the repeat season,'' said Stacey Lynn
Koerner of TN Media in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fox has tried out new midyear programming for a decade,
she said, viewers weren't conditioned to tune in, and the big three
networks didn't follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   When wily Richard Hatch was selected by his fellow ''Survivor''
castaways as the $1 million prize winner Wednesday night, 51.7
million viewers were watching.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor's'' 28.6 rating and 45 share of those watching TV
during the period was far from the 60.2 rating and 77 share for
TV's all-time leader, the ''M*A*S*H'' finale in 1983. But the
performance was extraordinary in this age of multiple cable and
satellite options.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last night was one of the most successful nights in the
network's history,'' CBS spokesman Chris Ender crowed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The network hopes to relive the experience with a ''Survivor''
repeat in September and ''Survivor II: The Australian Outback,''
debuting after the Super Bowl on Jan. 28.
</P>
<P>
   Copycats are lining up. A slew of reality series are in the
works, including ABC's ''The Chase'' and ''The Mole'' and possible
NBC contender ''Chains of Love,'' about a woman chained to four
prospective boyfriends.
</P>
<P>
   When about 75 million people tuned in for the ''Seinfeld''
finale in 1998, observers said it might represent the last hurrah
for broadcast TV. They were wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor'' reaffirmed broadcasting's ability to create a
shared water-cooler experience in a high-tech world in which people
find contact increasingly elusive.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of television's early history in 1948, when
Milton Berle's ''Texaco Star Theater'' would score ratings as high
as 80, as people gathered in the homes of friends with televisions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are very few opportunities for people to experience the
same event all at the same time and be able to talk about it day in
and day out,'' Koerner said. ''People are looking to be
connected.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition, not connection, was the rule on ''Survivor,'' which
dropped 16 people on a Malaysian island for 39 days and dangled a
million bucks in front of them. Hatch proved the master of the
island domain, outlasting finalists Susan Hawk, Rudy Boesch and
Kelly Wiglesworth.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone news conference Thursday, a relaxed-sounding
Hatch, who orchestrated an alliance that helped seal his victory,
said he wasn't concerned that some viewers saw him as a conniving
villain.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not who I am, and I'm really comfortable with how I
played the game,'' he said. ''It was a game, a really, really fun
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The 39-year-old corporate trainer, who's gay, said he's glad to
serve as a role model. The one-time 360-pounder from Middletown,
R.I., who has dropped more than 100 pounds also shared his diet
tips, revealed he had a post-island tummy tuck and said he's single
but eager to date.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Spread Across the Balkans  </HEADLINE>
By VESELIN ZHELEV
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- Bulgaria sent soldiers Thursday to put
out dozens of wildfires triggered by a heat wave that set off
blazes across the Balkans from Croatia to Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Ten people have been killed since the wildfires began three
months ago, fueled by temperatures that toped 104 degrees on some
days and winds sweeping the area in August.
</P>
<P>
   Three deaths were reported Thursday, while Bulgaria reported
seven people killed since the started in June.
</P>
<P>
   In Croatia, a 16-year-old was burned beyond recognition after he
approached a raging fire near the coastal city of Split, Croatia's
official news agency Hina reported.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, a fire along the Greek border with Albania killed an
elderly couple -- a man, 80, and a woman, 78 -- in the mountainous
village of Aghia Marina shortly after it was evacuated. The fire,
which originated in Albania, had a front about 25 miles long.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria's government has said it would seek international
financial aid to offset wildfire losses that have exceeded $19
million. The fires have destroyed almost 9,000 acres of forest and
farmland.
</P>
<P>
   The government said fires broke out in 69 areas in Bulgaria in
the past 24 hours, and 26 still burned.
</P>
<P>
   In the worst-hit area near Chirpan, 110 miles southeast of the
capital, Sofia, 2,223 acres of forest burned for a sixth day, and
local authorities declared a state of emergency.
</P>
<P>
   In Croatia, fires burned in 11 areas. Some 535 wildfires have
destroyed nearly 50,300 acres of forests and underbrush this year,
said Petar Jurjevic of the Croatian forest inspection agency.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of Metkovic, a town of 12,000 that is 30 miles from
Dubrovnik, were alerted to prepare for a possible evacuation as
fires advance.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 firefighters, assisted by planes and helicopters,
battled a blaze that has consumed about 7,400 acres of grass,
underbrush and forest near Promina, in the coastal region of
Dalmatia. On the northern Adriatic, fires threatened a shipyard
near the port of Rijeka.
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, hundreds of firefighters assisted by aircraft and
helicopters tried to stamp out about 30 fires on the mainland and
on the Aegean Sea islands of Naxos and Chios.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities declared a state of emergency in the southern
province of Arcadia, site of 10 blazes.
</P>
<P>
   Fires in Greece have destroyed 312,711 acres of forest and
scrub.
</P>
<P>
   In southern Serbia, residents of Dabinovac watched as a wildfire
headed toward their border village in the U.N.-established zone
separating Kosovo province from Serbia proper.
</P>
<P>
   They claimed that ethnic Albanian villagers from the northern
Kosovo region of Podujevo set the blaze to try to detonate mines
set in the border-area by the Yugoslav army before it retreated
from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''If something isn't done to put out the fire, in 24 hours it
will reach Dabinovac,'' said Dejan Milosevic, a farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Serbia, Yugoslav army troops and helicopters helped
firefighters and villagers battle a 3-day-old blaze engulfing
forests and peaks of Stara Mountain near the central Serbian city
of Nis.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Seizes More Cocaine  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA OLSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PUERTO ORDAZ, Venezuela (AP) -- Security forces have seized
another 2.5 tons of cocaine in the jungles of eastern Venezuela as
part of the nation's biggest anti-drug operation ever, a top
official said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the raids have netted 10 tons in raids since
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The latest seizure occurred at a farm Wednesday night just
outside the eastern mining town of Puerto Ordaz, said Col. Jose
Antonio Paez, who is the second in command of the National Guard's
anti-drug unit.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were flown by helicopter to the farm Thursday where
the drugs were seized. Two suspected drug traffickers from Colombia
led troops to the site on Wednesday, where the drugs were
discovered buried in two, 6-foot-deep holes, Paez said.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects were arrested while trying to escape the same
island where security forces last week seized more than 5 tons of
cocaine. The island is located in the middle of the Orinoco River
amid the jungles of eastern Delta Amacuro state.
</P>
<P>
   That seizure was accompanied by the arrest of 14 people in three
different countries -- part of an international effort to disband
the so-called Los Mellizos drug band.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is a key trafficking route for Colombian cocaine en
route to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the 14 people initially arrested were released after it
was determined that they were not involved in a crime, according to
the National Guard. Two people in Italy and one person in France
were among those detained in the international operation.
</P>
<P>
   Two Colombians captured in Venezuela were deported to the United
States where they were wanted on related drug trafficking charges,
according to U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration spokesman Michael
McManus.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Embassy officials called the operation ''an example of
excellent cooperation over a period of several months,'' between
the United States and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, France, Britain, Italy, Greece and Panama also
collaborated with the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Venezuelan officials have lauded the operation as an example of
continued U.S.-Venezuela cooperation in the drug war despite
President Hugo Chavez's repeated refusal to allow U.S. anti-drug
planes to fly over Venezuelan territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration helped finance Orinoco 2000.

<HEADLINE> UN Excludes Dalai Lama From Summit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations responded to the
''sensitivities'' of China in excluding the Dalai Lama from a world
conference of religious leaders, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me say that I understand that many people are
understandably and deeply disappointed that the Dalai Lama will not
be here for the religious summit next week,'' he said. ''But let me
also say that this house is really a house for the member states
and their sensitivities matter.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize winner, is the
spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists. He fled Tibet in 1959 after
a failed revolt against Chinese rule of the mountain region.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 religious leaders have been invited to the
Millennium World Peace Summit from Aug. 28-31, which will be held
in the U.N. General Assembly chamber for the first two days
although the United Nations is not an official sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   But U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard confirmed last month that the
Dalai Lama was left off the invitation list for fear that his
presence would draw a strong protest from China.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have invited the Dalai Lama to give the closing
address at a New York hotel, but he declined because he was left
out of the main conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''In any effort of this kind you try to make progress, take
progress as you get it, and not hold out for the absolute best,''
Annan said. ''And I personally believe that having a thousand
religious leaders here next week talking about peace, talking about
our world and praying for all of us and praying for peace is
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The conference is funded by Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation, the
Better World Fund and others. It will be held on the sidelines of
the U.N. Millennium Summit, which is expected to bring over 150
world leaders to U.N. headquarters from Sept. 6-8.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Battle Continues  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Iowa election officials drew Pat
Buchanan's name in a glass-bowl lottery Thursday after a raucous
hallway exchange between Reform Party factions fighting for a spot
on the state's November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, meanwhile, rival John Hagelin was the winner in a
film-can drawing.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Buchanan's name was pulled off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the party's national convention was supposed to
choose a nominee, the battle continues between Buchanan, the former
Republican, and Hagelin, the Natural Law candidate embraced by
supporters of Reform Party founder Ross Perot as a way of blocking
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate says he's the party's legitimate nominee. And
state election officials, facing deadlines for printing ballots,
are caught in the middle, sometimes even resorting to lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we consider that party over-nominated,'' dryly
observed Larry Perosino, a spokesman for Connecticut's secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Buchanan had been briefly listed, but was pulled
from the ballot Thursday at the request of party leaders, said
Alfie Charles, a spokesman for the secretary of state there. Party
leaders ''continue to meet to resolve the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan claimed the national nomination at the party's Long
Beach, Calif., convention, but some disaffected party members
walked out and chose Hagelin, who has run for president before
under the Natural Law Party banner.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with conflicting instructions from party officials,
election officials in Iowa and Montana turned to lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Secretary of State Chet Culver drew Buchanan's name from a
glass bowl, but only after a bitter exchange in the hallway outside
his office.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan backer Ed Moses claimed to be the official leader of
the state's Reform Party and labeled documents filed by Hagelin
backers as ''bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired of this fiasco,'' said Moses.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is coming here to rabble rouse,'' grumbled Simi Summer, a
Hagelin backer.
</P>
<P>
   ''God was with us,'' shouted Moses, after Buchanan's name was
drawn.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the drawing, Buchanan will be listed as the
Reform Party candidate and Hagelin will be on the ballot as
''nominated by petition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not taking anyone off the ballot,'' said Culver.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, Secretary of State Mike Cooney pulled Hagelin's name
from a ballot box filled with film cans -- 10 for each man -- giving
him the Reform Party designation. Both sides opposed the drawing,
and a lawsuit is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness reflects a split that has developed as Buchanan
has tried to take over the reins of the party founded by Perot.
Despite gaining control of the old party structure, Buchanan still
must fight a state-by-state battle to gain access to ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for setting most ballots is in late August or early
September, so the fight is coming to a head.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to get clarification who is the real candidate,''
said Michigan Board of Elections spokesman Chris Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky and South Carolina, election officials are waiting
to see if the Reform Party itself can sort through the issue. Those
officials, and their counterparts in Oklahoma, say they might ask
the Federal Election Commission for guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, both will be listed as independents, and in
Minnesota the Reform Party is considered a minor party, though Gov.
Jesse Ventura was once a member.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no protection for the minor parties,'' said Secretary
of State Mary Kiffmeyer. Both men will be listed.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin started out this year as the candidate of the Natural
Law Party, and West Virginia election officials say that's how he
will be listed on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case in Ohio, too, where Buchanan submitted enough
signatures to get on the ballot as an independent. In Pennsylvania,
the party submitted Buchanan's name, and a deadline for Hagelin to
challenge passed Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, Buchanan backers had submitted petitions with more
than 30,000 signatures, double the number needed to be listed on
the ballot under the Reform party banner.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin was first to file in North Carolina, but the State Board
of Elections voted 3-1 Thursday to list Buchanan as the Reform
candidate, despite arguments by party stalwarts that he is not
their choice. State Reform officials had certified Hagelin as their
candidate last week.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's forces are challenging and the state Elections Board
must resolve the dispute, with a court fight possible. An appeals
panel was hearing arguments Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Utah, a supporter submitted Buchanan's name as the party's
nominee, and that's how he'll be listed on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Most polls have shown Buchanan with just 1 or 2 percent support
nationally. Hagelin has less than that. Perot won 19 percent of the
vote in the 1992 election and 8 percent in 1996. He declined to run
this year.

<HEADLINE> Court Gives Mexican Gay Man Asylum  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KRAVETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A cross-dressing, gay Mexican man who
claims he was persecuted in his homeland because of his sexuality
is entitled to asylum in the United States, a federal appeals panel
ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by three judges of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals expanded the social circumstances of persecution that
immigration officials must consider during asylum hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts already have allowed asylum for a variety of
political and social reasons, including a woman's fear of genital
mutilation in her African homeland. Last month, the 9th Circuit
ruled that an Armenian who said he was given an ultimatum to become
a Communist or leave Armenia deserved another bid for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   The case decided Thursday involves Geovanni Hernandez-Montiel, a
gay Mexican citizen who dresses and behaves as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   He testified that he was harassed and persecuted by his family,
school officials and police, who he said sexually assaulted him. He
was also hospitalized for a week after a knife attack by a group of
men who called him derogatory names, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he fled to the United States and requested asylum but
was denied.
</P>
<P>
   At his hearing before immigration officials, a Latin American
history expert testified that gay men with female sexual identities
in Mexico are heavily persecuted by the police and other groups and
are likely to become scapegoats for Mexico's economic and political
problems. The expert said Hernandez-Montiel faced persecution if
deported.
</P>
<P>
   Judge A. Wallace Tashima wrote that the appeals panel had
determined that ''gay men with female sexual identities in Mexico
constitute a protected 'particular social group' under the asylum
statute ... and that Geovanni is a member of that group.''
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Immigration Appeals had contended Hernandez-Montiel
did not establish that he suffered abuse because of his membership
in a particular social group and that he should return to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The appellate panel ordered the board to reverse its decision
and approve Hernandez-Montiel's request for asylum.

<HEADLINE> Cheney: Monuments May Be Rescinded  </HEADLINE>
By JOSEPH B. FRAZIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTRAL POINT, Ore. (AP) -- Republican vice presidential hopeful
Dick Cheney raised the possibility Thursday that some of the
national monuments created by President Clinton could be reviewed
and possibly rescinded if he and George W. Bush are elected in
November.
</P>
<P>
   ''Of course it's not my decision to make. It's the
president-elect who has to make the decision,'' Cheney said,
commenting on what is a hot topic in the West. ''But I certainly
expect we would review a lot of these decisions to see whether or
not any action was appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Clinton has used his executive authority ''willy-nilly
all over the West'' to create national monuments without
considering the desires of the people who will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Many fear that creating monument after monument could harm the
Western economy by removing land from commercial uses like grazing,
logging and mining.
</P>
<P>
   During his time in office, Clinton has created or added to 10
national monuments covering nearly 4 million Western acres in his
effort to carve out an environmental legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Juleanna Glover Weiss, a Cheney spokeswoman, later noted that
Bush has conceded it would be difficult to rescind a national
monument designation. She said he wanted to stress that a
Bush-Cheney administration would give local residents greater input
regarding any future designations.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said that as a congressman from Wyoming he helped get 1
million acres designated as wilderness -- but only after listening
to all sides.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to strike a balance. We need an opportunity for all to
be heard,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after flying to Portland, Cheney rebutted Democratic
claims that as president Bush would only appoint Supreme Court
justices who favor outlawing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't have any litmus test when it comes time to pick
judges,'' Cheney told The Associated Press in a brief interview. He
said that while he and Bush both oppose abortion, ''we recognize
that is a tough issue for people on both sides of the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Central Point, Cheney, formerly chief executive of the
oil services firm Halliburton Co., addressed the issue of
exploiting new oil fields while protecting surrounding ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   He said new drilling techniques make it possible to tap oil
fields beneath the Alaska National Wildlife Arctic Refuge while
leaving ''minimal environmental footprints.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic presidential rival Al Gore opposes opening the
Alaskan refuge to oil drilling.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney said the United States must find new sources for oil
because domestic production from existing fields declines annually.
</P>
<P>
   He was greeted at the airport in nearby Medford by a group of
college-age protesters in cocktail dresses and tuxedos pretending
to be billionaires with names such as ''Hue G. Payough'' and
''Ivana Ownu.''
</P>
<P>
   The group called itself ''Billionaires for Bush,'' part of a
nonpartisan spoof by United for a Fair Economy to draw attention to
campaign spending and growing financial inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Cheney extolled the virtues of the family farm to about
150 people at Crater High School, including members of the school's
Future Farmers of America organization. He said one reason a
Bush-Cheney administration would abolish the estate tax would be to
help farmers ''pass on from one generation to the next their farms
and ranches.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not just the sheer number of people in agriculture. It's
the values we want to preserve,'' Cheney said, recalling his
childhood in rural Nebraska and relatives who were farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want a situation where all we have are large
corporate farms,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> It's a state-by-state Reform Party ballot battle  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE GLOVER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - Iowa election officials drew Pat
Buchanan's name in a glass-bowl lottery Thursday after a raucous
hallway exchange between Reform Party factions fighting for a spot
on the state's November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, meanwhile, rival John Hagelin was the winner in a
film-can drawing.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Buchanan's name was pulled off the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the party's national convention was supposed to
choose a nominee, the battle continues between Buchanan, the former
Republican, and Hagelin, the Natural Law candidate embraced by
supporters of Reform Party founder Ross Perot as a way of blocking
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate says he's the party's legitimate nominee. And
state election officials, facing deadlines for printing ballots,
are caught in the middle, sometimes even resorting to lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now we consider that party over-nominated,'' dryly
observed Larry Perosino, a spokesman for Connecticut's secretary of
state.
</P>
<P>
   In California, Buchanan had been briefly listed, but was pulled
from the ballot Thursday at the request of party leaders, said
Alfie Charles, a spokesman for the secretary of state there. Party
leaders ''continue to meet to resolve the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan claimed the national nomination at the party's Long
Beach, Calif., convention, but some disaffected party members
walked out and chose Hagelin, who has run for president before
under the Natural Law Party banner.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with conflicting instructions from party officials,
election officials in Iowa and Montana turned to lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Secretary of State Chet Culver drew Buchanan's name from a
glass bowl, but only after a bitter exchange in the hallway outside
his office.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan backer Ed Moses claimed to be the official leader of
the state's Reform Party and labeled documents filed by Hagelin
backers as ''bogus.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired of this fiasco,'' said Moses.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is coming here to rabble rouse,'' grumbled Simi Summer, a
Hagelin backer.
</P>
<P>
   ''God was with us,'' shouted Moses, after Buchanan's name was
drawn.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the drawing, Buchanan will be listed as the
Reform Party candidate and Hagelin will be on the ballot as
''nominated by petition.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not taking anyone off the ballot,'' said Culver.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, Secretary of State Mike Cooney pulled Hagelin's name
from a ballot box filled with film cans - 10 for each man - giving
him the Reform Party designation. Both sides opposed the drawing,
and a lawsuit is expected.
</P>
<P>
   The bitterness reflects a split that has developed as Buchanan
has tried to take over the reins of the party founded by Perot.
Despite gaining control of the old party structure, Buchanan still
must fight a state-by-state battle to gain access to ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for setting most ballots is in late August or early
September, so the fight is coming to a head.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're trying to get clarification who is the real candidate,''
said Michigan Board of Elections spokesman Chris Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   In Kentucky and South Carolina, election officials are waiting
to see if the Reform Party itself can sort through the issue. Those
officials, and their counterparts in Oklahoma, say they might ask
the Federal Election Commission for guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, both will be listed as independents, and in
Minnesota the Reform Party is considered a minor party, though Gov.
Jesse Ventura was once a member.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no protection for the minor parties,'' said Secretary
of State Mary Kiffmeyer. Both men will be listed.
</P>
<P>
   Hagelin started out this year as the candidate of the Natural
Law Party, and West Virginia election officials say that's how he
will be listed on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   That's the case in Ohio, too, where Buchanan submitted enough

<HEADLINE> Little League W.S. Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- They came to the Little League World
Series with one bat.
</P>
<P>
   The Maracaibo, Venezuela, team, made up primarily of players
from lower-middle class families, is certainly not the wealthiest
team in Williamsport, but manager Eduvino Quevedo said, it might be
the toughest.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mainly, they're fighters in all aspects,'' Quevedo said
through interpreter Luis Sanchez after Maracaibo beat Tokyo on
Thursday to reach the championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ''From a baseball perspective, they have to deal with other
leagues that are more affluent, such as Coquivacoa, who have better
equipment, better coaches, etc. Them being from a somewhat poor
neighborhood, it's tough for them to compete with those type of
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Coquivacoa, which won the series in 1994, is part of Maracaibo,
but located about 40 miles from the Sierra Maestra Little League
that Quevedo's team is from.
</P>
<P>
   Because his players are not always able to provide themselves
with all the necessary equipment, donations play a huge part in the
success of Quevedo's team.
</P>
<P>
   Four players on the team lacked spikes at the beginning of
tournament play, and first baseman Adrian Chourio made the trip to
Williamsport with only $10.
</P>
<P>
   The needs of all five players have since been taken care of.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment companies also have helped. The team will leave
Williamsport with approximately 20 more bats.

   JETERS HONORED: Charles Jeter finally got his moment in the
spotlight, and he took advantage.
</P>
<P>
   When accepting the 2000 George and Barbara Bush Little League
Parents of the Year Award Thursday morning for himself and his
wife, the father of New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter took
several minutes to make his thank-you speech.
</P>
<P>
   His son normally has a stranglehold on the spotlight, joked
Charles Jeter, who added that he was going to prolong his moment as
long as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Charles and Dorothy Jeter were active volunteers in the Westwood
Little League in Kalamazoo, Mich., during both Derek and his sister
Sharlee's playing days there. Charles also coached both of his
children.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy coached Sharlee as well.
</P>
<P>
   Derek also gives back to youth organizations like Little League
through his Turn 2 Foundation in Michigan, Florida, New York and
Ohio. The organization supports activities and programs that
provide kids alternatives to drugs and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush award was first presented in 1981 to the parents of
Hall of Famer Mike Schmidt. It has since been awarded to the
parents of Nolan Ryan, Carl Yastrzemski, Frank Thomas and Mark
McGwire, among others.

   HAWKEYE RIVALRY? The number of people back in Iowa following
Davenport's run to the Series' U.S. Pool final has drawn
comparisons to that of the religious passion supporting Iowa
Hawkeyes football.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Davenport manager Matt Kolar noted that it's
been like ''Hawkeye Saturdays'' back home with fans crowding around
TV sets whenever his team plays.
</P>
<P>
   After Wednesday's win that launched Davenport to the U.S. final,
Kolar was asked if he was going to bump the Hawkeyes off the front
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Kolar responded: ''I don't know. I guess they play Kansas State
on Saturday, so they'll be on the front page, but it ain't going to
be pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   BASELINES: While Davenport became the first Central Region team
to reach the U.S. final since pool play was introduced in 1992,
Bellaire became the sixth South team, tying the West for most
berths. The East has qualified five times.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Basketball Team Gathers  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- With the biggest trade in NBA history
officially dead, Vin Baker and Gary Payton were a couple of unhappy
SuperSonics as they arrived for USOC processing Thursday, their
first full day as members of the U.S. Olympic men's basketball
team.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who had been ecstatic at the prospect of joining the New
York Knicks, instead found out that the chances of him being traded
there had shrunk to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Payton, happy to be keeping Baker as a teammate, was nonetheless
miffed over the way Seattle management had kept him out of the loop
while working on a four-team deal that also included the Lakers and
Pistons.
</P>
<P>
   About the only member of the Olympic team happy with the day's
turn of events was coach Rudy Tomjanovich, who pumped his fist in
excitement when he learned that the big trade was dead and his
team, the Houston Rockets, would likely land free agent forward
Maurice Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what we wanted to hear, that Ewing's not going to
Seattle,'' Tomjanovich said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ewing might not be going anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   New York general manager Scott Layden said the team will
continue its efforts to trade Ewing, but it is now more likely than
not that Ewing will be a member of the Knicks when training camp
opens Oct. 3. Ewing retains his no-trade veto and can turn down any
trade that is not to his liking.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll only do what's right for everyone concerned,'' Layden
said. ''If there is a chance for Patrick to get a fresh start and
for the Knicks to improve as a team, we'll make a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But it won't be with Seattle, that much is certain.
</P>
<P>
   Sonics general manager Wally Walker flew to Washington last week
to have dinner with Ewing and his agent, David Falk, and it was at
that meeting that Ewing became sold on the idea of joining the
Sonics.
</P>
<P>
   A four-team trade was worked out sending Ewing to Seattle,
Baker, Glen Rice and Travis Knight to New York, Christian Laettner
and Chris Dudley to the Lakers and seven marginal players, plus two
draft picks and $3 million in cash, to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The Pistons pulled out at the last minute, and several days of
subsequent talks failed to produce a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is dead, and we'll come in tomorrow and lick our wounds and
see where we are,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit now seems set to send Laettner to Dallas for Cedric
Ceballos, John Wallace and Eric Murdock in a deal that could be
announced early next week.
</P>
<P>
   More uncertain is what will happen to Rice. The Lakers had hoped
to move him in a sign-and-trade agreement that would bring them a
power forward, and Rice's options have dwindled so severely that he
now may have to sign a one-year with the lowly Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago was one of many teams also trying to work out a deal for
Charlotte center Brad Miller, who now becomes the most sought after
free agent on the market.
</P>
<P>
   All the NBA maneuverings were being closely monitored by the
members of the Olympic team as they spent several hours at a naval
base and had a team photo taken.
</P>
<P>
   When they weren't pushing Home Depot shopping carts around to
load up on warmup suits, team hats, shoes, sandals and leather
jackets, members of the Olympic team sneaked off to a corner to
talk on their cell phones or gossip with their new teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Baker was especially anxious to hear what Layden and Walker, who
had both remained publicly silent for more than a week, said to
reporters on conference calls.
</P>
<P>
   Layden, departing from his usual practice of refusing to comment
on trades, said Ewing and Falk had never discussed a contract
extension with him and had never demanded a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Layden also said he expects the Knicks to be a contender in the
East even if they are unable to find another trade involving Ewing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever awkward feelings there may be, I expect he will come
back and have a strong season for the Knicks. And when he comes
through the tunnel at Madison Square Garden for the first time,
there's going to be a standing ovation,'' Layden said.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who has a strained relationship with Sonics coach Paul
Westphal, seemed resigned to the fact that he'll probably be back
in Seattle when the Olympics are over.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really had a good 24 hours when I considered myself a Knick.
It was a great feeling for my family and friends. But now we have
to rethink things,'' he said. ''I'm at a point in my career where I
needed a new start and I thought New York would have been a good
place to have that start because it was just time to change. We'll
see where we go from here.''

   MINA SALMAN PORT, Bahrain (AP) -- Bahraini authorities and U.S. Navy divers
based in the Persian Gulf recovered both ''black boxes'' -- the flight data and
voice cockpit recorders -- near where Gulf Air Flight 072 crashed, killing all
143 aboard. Neither box appeared damaged, according to Bahrain civil defense

Bush Defends His Tax Cut Plan

   MIAMI (AP) -- George W. Bush today defended his $1.3 trillion tax-cut plan

''I welcome this tax debate. I hope we debate taxes between now and Election
Day,'' the Republican Texas governor said as he sought to counter Democratic
allegations that his plan would mainly help the wealthy. Bush has suggested that
the failure of his 10-year plan to gain wider acceptance so far is due to lack

of mishandling U.S. nuclear secrets. Lee, 60, had twice before been denied bail.
U.S. District Judge James Parker relented after a hearing in which Lee's lawyers
cast doubt on the solidity of the government's case and just how sensitive the
nuclear material was. ''I conclude that there now is a combination of conditions
that will reasonably assure the appearance of Dr. Lee as required and the safety

School Smoking Drops Slightly
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Smoking among high-schoolers dropped slightly last year after
climbing for most of the 1990s, the government said today. Government analysts
attributed the drop to teen smoking prevention programs and the higher cost of
cigarettes. The CDC said 34.8 percent of high school students in 1999 reported
that they had smoked a cigarette in the previous 30 days. That was down from
36.4 percent in 1997 and the first overall decline since the government's first
such study, in 1991.

'Survivor' Finale Dominates Ratings
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''Survivor,'' which dominated ratings and pop-culture
discourse, has changed the face of summer programming and breathed new life into
network broadcasting. ABC, NBC and CBS have long hung out a ''gone fishing''
sign during the hot weather months. Then ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
scored with viewers last summer on ABC, and CBS' ''Survivor'' picked up the tiki
torch and ran with it. But ''Survivor's'' 28.6 rating and 45 share of those
watching TV was far from the 60.2 rating and 77 share for TV's all-time leader,
the ''M A S H'' finale in 1983.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- Ken Hill lasted only 2 1-3 innings in his White Sox debut and
Brook Fordyce drove in three runs against his former team as the Baltimore
Orioles beat Chicago 8-5 today. Hill (5-8), released earlier this month by the
Anaheim Angels, was signed to a minor league contract by the White Sox. He was
added to Chicago's roster before the game to give the team's beleaguered
starting rotation a boost.

<HEADLINE> Black Boxes Recovered in Gulf Crash  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINA SALMAN PORT, Bahrain (AP) -- A man's black shoe, a plastic
sandal and bits of yellow foam padding bobbed Thursday in the
waters off this tiny island nation, where families were burying
loved ones a day after Gulf Air Flight 072 crashed, killing all 143
aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Bahraini authorities and U.S. Navy divers based in the Gulf
recovered both ''black boxes'' -- the flight data and voice cockpit
recorders -- near where the plane slammed into shallow water off
Bahrain's shore. Neither box appeared damaged, according to Bahrain
civil defense chief James Windsor, who received the voice cockpit
recorder Thursday from U.S. Navy divers who brought it to shore.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities were awaiting the arrival of experts from the U.S.
National Transportation Safety Board for help with the Bahraini-led
investigation. Six French government experts and an Airbus
Industries representative flew in Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Ali Ahmedi, a spokesman and an acting vice president for Gulf
Air, said it was too early to speculate on what caused the plane to
crash as it circled the airport before coming in to land. But he
said there was no indication the pilot was anticipating an
emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   ''The pilot did not make any kind of statements of problems in
the plane,'' Ahmedi said.
</P>
<P>
   Transportation Minister Sheik Ali bin Khalifa Al Khalifa said he
was hopeful the black boxes would provide some clues. ''Any news,
anything out of it would be a help,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the best of circumstances, a water landing is risky, said
Michael Barr, director of the aviation program at the University of
Southern California. Even a pilot coming in relatively slowly onto
the water, hoping to skip across its surface like a stone tossed by
a child, could clip a wing and lose control, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the depth of the water would make little difference to the
landing, experts said: A large airplane that crashes at high speed
is going to be destroyed, whatever it hits.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of that destruction lay off Bahrain on Thursday. In
waters often less than 10 feet deep, shadowy bits of wing and
fuselage, mostly in small pieces, were resting on the sandy sea
floor. A few recognizable pieces of the Gulf Air Airbus 320
protruded from the water: a ripped tail wing with the airline's
black, red and gold logo, skin of the fuselage with the letters 'LF
AIR' above the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Most traces of the 143 victims were collected in the hours after
the Cairo-to-Bahrain flight crashed Wednesday evening. Luggage and
clothing that floated to the surface were removed so they wouldn't
be swept away with the tides.
</P>
<P>
   Like the plane, many of the bodies were shattered, and relatives
struggled to identify loved ones so they could claim their remains
for burial.
</P>
<P>
   At a hotel in the capital, relatives sobbed as a Gulf Air
official, his voice choking, read out names of their loved ones
listed as victims. Family members were asked to make
identifications from photos taken after the bodies were recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the worst day of my life. I lost a part of me,'' said
Khalifa al-Hashil, 45, of Saudi Arabia. His 35-year-old brother,
Mohammed, died in the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen victims were buried Thursday at Manama Cemetery, the
country's largest. Mohammed Jassim, 45, an undertaker at the
cemetery, washed disfigured faces and mutilated bodies with rose
water before the remains -- still in body bags tagged at a makeshift
morgue -- were placed in freshly dug graves.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a painful sight,'' he said. ''I've handled dead bodies
before, but none so dreadful to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   In 15-minute intervals, white Health Ministry vans pulled up at
the cemetery to unload victims in tagged body bags. Chants of ''God
is Great'' and mournful wails wafted over the cemetery during the
burial. Relatives offered prayers for the dead, standing side by
side, while others wept on each other's shoulders as clerics tried
to comfort them.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-six of the 143 victims were children, officials said. All
appeared to have been traveling with their families. Many families
in the region are ending vacations at this time of year, which
could account for the large number of children aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Amjad Obaid, a physician, was burying his sister-in-law,
4-year-old niece and 10-year-old nephew. He said a disaster alert
on his pager had summoned him to work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Only when I got to the hospital I found out that this plane
carried my brother's wife and her children,'' Obaid said. They had
been returning from a vacation in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   After the crash, U.S. Navy helicopters, small boats and an
oceangoing tug quickly joined the nighttime search and rescue
effort a few miles off the northern coast of Bahrain. The island is
the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet. Bahraini Crown
Prince Sheik Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa personally directed the
effort, the U.S. military said.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air said 135 passengers and eight crew members were on
board. They included 64 Egyptians, 36 Bahrainis, 12 Saudi Arabians,
nine Palestinians, six from the United Arab Emirates, three
Chinese, two British, two Omanis, and one each from the United
States, Canada, Kuwait, Sudan, Australia, the Philippines, Poland,
India and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The American killed in the crash was 31-year-old Seth J. Foti, a
diplomatic courier carrying classified information in yellow
pouches, the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Foti had joined the service 14 months ago, spokesman Richard
Boucher said. He said he did not know what Foti had with him when
the plane went down.
</P>
<P>
   ''His dedication to the mission of the courier service was
unmatched, and he was clearly an asset to the Department of State
and the U.S. government,'' Boucher said.

<HEADLINE> Debby Dissipates off Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS TUNAS, Cuba (AP) -- Tropical Storm Debby dissipated Thursday
off Cuba after showering the eastern part of the island with
much-needed rain and soaking northern Haiti.
</P>
<P>
   As the one-time hurricane lost its punch, authorities lifted an
evacuation order for the Florida Keys, and tropical storm warnings
were lifted in Cuba and other Caribbean nations.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 a.m. EDT, Debby's winds had dropped to about 40 mph, well
below tropical storm force. Its remnants were swirling hours later
between Cuba and Jamaica. Forecasters continued to watch the former
hurricane for signs it might regain strength.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are still some strong winds'' in that area, said
forecaster Laura Salvador of the National Hurricane Center in
Miami, which warned that the danger of floods in Haiti, Cuba and
Jamaica continues.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities had evacuated at least 7,000 people in Cuba. Heavy
rains and winds lashed the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay in
southeastern Cuba, home to nearly 1,600 U.S. servicemen and their
families.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're doing fine. They prepared for the heavy weather and
lashed down anything that could become a flying object,'' said Pat
Dooling, spokesman for U.S. Navy Region Southeast in Jacksonville,
Florida, which oversees the Guantanamo Bay base.
</P>
<P>
   Feared mudslides in Haiti's deforested northern mountains didn't
happen Thursday. ''We're relieved it's all over,'' said Jacques
Louis Henry, owner of the private Radio Etincelle in Port-de-Paix.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in the Dominican Republic said more than 700 people
had been forced out of their homes by flooding Wednesday, but Debby
caused little damage to Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and
small northeast Caribbean islands.
</P>
<P>
   Rains ''continue to be the most significant factor in this
storm,'' for drought-stricken Cuba, the government station Radio
Reloj reported. It has been the driest summer in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ''A good rain wouldn't do us any harm,'' said Roger Batista,
civil defense director in the Cuban coastal province of Las Tunas.

<HEADLINE> CHANGES DATELINE from Milwaukee.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Mayor Rudolph Giuliani responded angrily
Thursday to an animal-rights advertisement that shows him with a
milk mustache alongside the words ''Got prostate cancer?''
</P>
<P>
   He threatened to sue People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals, which placed the ad on two billboards in Wisconsin on
Wednesday and is planning a third. The ad, a parody of the dairy
industry's popular ''Got Milk?'' campaign, claims that drinking
milk can cause prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has been diagnosed with the disease, which earlier this
year derailed his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tasteless and inappropriate to exploit my illness and
also takes advantage of my position as the mayor for advertising
purposes,'' Giuliani told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Milk has absolutely nothing to do with why I have prostate
cancer,'' he said. ''The message they're trying to deliver just
makes sense in their own zealous, out-of-control thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   He said PETA should not be allowed to use his image in an
advertisement without his permission.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm considering suing them because I think what they're doing
is outrageous,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   PETA's vegetarian campaign coordinator, Bruce Friedrich, said
the ads are meant ''to bring the message that dairy products are
horrible for human health, catastrophic for the environment and a
living nightmare for these cows and their veal calf babies.''
</P>
<P>
   He said PETA chose Wisconsin for the ad because dairy is such a
major industry there.
</P>
<P>
   Farming leaders in Wisconsin are irate over the billboards,
which went up Wednesday in Appleton and Oshkosh. A third is planned
in Fond du Lac.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think their antics are no longer funny. They're getting
pretty despicable,'' said Tom Thieding, spokesman for the Wisconsin
Farm Bureau Federation.
</P>
<P>
   A PETA ad campaign that urged college students to drink beer
instead of milk was pulled last spring because of objections by
Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   ''True to form, it's their typical insensitive way of misleading
the public for their own gain,'' said Debra Wendorf Boyke,
spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board.
</P>
<P>
   She said research points to dairy products helping fight high
blood pressure, colon cancer and osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   However, a study by the Harvard School of Public Health in April
raised the possibility that consuming dairy products may increase
the risk of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   That study said consuming lots of milk and other dairy products
might modestly raise the risk of prostate cancer, although the case
was far from settled. It recommended further study of calcium's
effects on health.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebels Attack UN Soldiers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Sierra Leone's rebels attacked
U.N. and government soldiers along a strategic road leading to the
international airport, injuring two peacekeepers, U.N. officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary United Front rebels attacked government troops
late Wednesday at Kabatha Junction, about 80 miles north of the
capital, Freetown, U.N. spokeswoman Hirut Befecadu said. The army
repelled the attack with an undetermined number of casualties on
both sides, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Later the same night, the rebels attacked a U.N. post farther
south along the road that links Lungi airport to the western town
of Port Loko. Two Nigerian U.N. peacekeepers were injured, said
Befecadu, who was not aware of any rebel casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation has now been brought under control,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Sierra Leone's civil war began in 1991, the rebels have
systematically killed and maimed tens of thousands of people in an
attempt to gain control of the government and the country's
lucrative diamond-mining regions. They have abandoned three peace
treaties, the latest signed last July.
</P>
<P>
   In a bid to restart the peace process, the government Wednesday
released 171 rebels -- including four children -- imprisoned in
Freetown and surrounding towns since the RUF reignited the conflict
in May, said Moses Showers, deputy director of prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The released rebels were all ex-combatants, but did not include
members of the RUF leadership. More could be released in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.N. Security Council voted unanimously to create
a special court aimed at prosecuting rebel leaders in Sierra Leone
for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Foday Sankoh, the now-imprisoned founding leader and spiritual
guide of the RUF, is expected to be one of the first people brought
to trial.
</P>
<P>
   At U.N. headquarters in New York, military officials from the
nine countries contributing troops to the peacekeeping force said
Wednesday that the international community must support the effort
and help promote a political solution, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan invited officers from from
Bangladesh, Ghana, Guinea, India, Jordan, Kenya, Nigeria, Russia,
and Zambia, to listen to their views on strengthening the U.N.
mission.
</P>
<P>
   At Wednesday's meeting, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said, the
nine countries ''stressed the responsibility of the whole
international community'' for assisting the force.
</P>
<P>
   The officers also underscored the importance of the commitment
by Sierra Leone's government ''to do its utmost to stabilize the
situation in the country, as well as to maintain political and
military pressure on the RUF,'' Eckhard said.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's schoolchildren are doing a little better in
mathematics than they were a decade ago, but for many of them reading and
science skills have declined slightly since 1992. The government's 1999 National
Assessment of Education Progress also shows a widening gap in the test
performance of white and black elementary school students on reading, math and

RNC Soft Money Donations Surged
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican National Committee collected almost
$800,000 in unregulated soft money donations from energy companies after George
W. Bush tapped Halliburton Co. chief executive Dick Cheney as his running mate.
Cheney headed the oil services company for five years after formerly serving in
Congress and as secretary of defense; Bush also is a former oil company
executive. Cheney resigned his post last week. The $791,100 in energy
contributions during the last week of July were part of the $25.2 million in
soft money donations the RNC took in last month -- half as much as they raised
during the previous six months.

Cheney: Monuments May Be Rescinded
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CENTRAL POINT, Ore. (AP) -- Republican vice presidential hopeful Dick Cheney
raised the possibility today that some of the national monuments created by
President Clinton could be reviewed and possibly rescinded if he and George W.
Bush are elected in November. Cheney said Clinton has used his executive
authority ''willy-nilly all over the West'' to create national monuments without
considering the people. Many fear that creating monument after monument could
harm the Western economy by removing land from commercial uses like grazing,
logging and mining. Clinton has created or added to 10 national monuments
covering nearly 4 million Western acres.

of mishandling U.S. nuclear secrets. Lee, 60, had twice before been denied bail.
U.S. District Judge James Parker relented after a hearing in which Lee's lawyers
cast doubt on the solidity of the government's case and just how sensitive the
nuclear material was. ''I conclude that there now is a combination of conditions
that will reasonably assure the appearance of Dr. Lee as required and the safety

its investigation includes all 47 million ATX, ATX II and Wilderness brands. New

<HEADLINE> RNC Soft Money Donations Surged  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican National Committee collected
almost $800,000 in unregulated soft money donations from energy
companies after George W. Bush tapped Halliburton Co. chief
executive Dick Cheney as his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies had not given any soft money this year until
Cheney joined the ticket. Cheney headed the oil services company
for five years after formerly serving in Congress and as secretary
of defense; Bush also is a former oil company executive. Cheney
resigned his post last week.
</P>
<P>
   The $791,100 in energy contributions during the last week of
July were part of the $25.2 million in soft money donations the RNC
took in last month -- half as much as they raised during the
previous six months. The party took in 86 donations of $100,000 or
more.
</P>
<P>
   RNC spokesman Bill Pascoe acknowledged that Cheney's selection
helped boost donations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It really is a reflection of very broad and obviously deep
support for the ticket,'' Pascoe said. ''Once the announcement was
made, the floodgates opened.''
</P>
<P>
   While soft money is not subject to federal contribution limits
and cannot be used to directly aid federal candidates, both parties
use the funds to help pay for issue ads designed to help elect
their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the soft money contributions, the Republican National
Committee last month raised $12.4 million under federal
contribution limits, so-called ''hard money'' used to directly help
candidates. Since Jan. 1, 1999, the RNC has raised almost $180
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee, which reports its finances
quarterly, raised $108 million from Jan. 1, 1999, through June 30,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the DNC added $1.25 million in hard money to its
coffers at two intimate fund-raising dinners at a Washington hotel.
At the first, Democratic presidential nominee Al Gore and
Democratic National Chairman Joe Andrew spoke to 50
Indian-Americans who had paid $5,000 apiece and dined on salad and
sea bass.
</P>
<P>
   Gore apologized for a sore throat. ''Someone said it's actually
better and that the problem was before I was campaigning in my own
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The second dinner, prepared according to Jewish dietary laws,
featured Gore and vice-presidential nominee Joseph Lieberman
speaking to friends and supporters of the Connecticut senator, who
had raised $50,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Hadassah Lieberman introduced her husband, who responded with a
kiss. It drew laughs from the audience that recalled Gore's smooch
with wife Tipper at the Democratic convention last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want you to think there is any kind of competition on
this ticket but I'm not going to stop until we reach seven seconds,
which is the current world record,'' Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee's biggest energy donation
after Cheney joined the ticket came from Black Beauty Coal Corp. of
Evansville, Ind., and its chief executive, Steven Chancellor. They
gave a total of $310,000 after Bush picked Cheney. They had not
previously given any soft money during the 1999-2000 election
cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, said energy executives clearly are excited over the
Bush-Cheney ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly the addition of Cheney made it a pure oil ticket, so I
imagine anyone in the energy sector would be enthusiastic,'' said
Makinson, whose nonpartisan research group studies campaign
finance. ''I can see why they would be energized.''
</P>
<P>
   Other big donors to the RNC last month have issues pending
before the federal government, including:
</P>
<P>
   -- Schering Corp., which gave $100,000. The company is seeking
legislation that would allow it to request a patent extension for
its popular Claritin anti-allergy medication.
</P>
<P>
   -- SBC Communications, which gave $125,000. Like the other Bell
operating companies, SBC wants permission to carry data over
long-distance lines.
</P>
<P>
   -- Beretta USA, which contributed $100,000. The company is part
of a group of gun makers that have asked the courts to prevent 16
cities from buying police guns only from companies that agree to
strict safety measures.

<HEADLINE> Middle school teacher admits sex with student  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TROY, N.Y. (AP) - A middle school teacher on Thursday admitted
having sex with a former student and will spend six months in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Melissa Dorr, 30, was charged in May with felony counts of
third-degree rape, statutory rape, and four counts of sodomy. She
pleaded guilty to reduced charges and, with the jail time, was
sentenced to five years probation.
</P>
<P>
   Dorr admitted having sex with the boy - now 18- at a movie
theater on his 15th birthday and again about a month later in a
city park. The boy had gone to live with Dorr and her husband when
he was 16 after a minor brush with the law.
</P>
<P>
   Margold Ryan, the boy's mother, has said the relationship began
when he was 14 and a student in Dorr's special education class at
Doyle Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Dorr also resigned the teaching post she has held for nine years
and relinquished her license to teach.

<HEADLINE> Little League W.S. Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Ross Haggard provided the pitching and
Terrence McConn the punch as Bellaire, Texas, advanced to the
Little League World Series championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Haggard pitched a four-hitter and struck out 13, and McConn hit
two homers and drove in four runs as Bellaire beat Davenport, Iowa,
8-0 Thursday night in the U.S. Pool championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire will face Maracaibo, Venezuela, which upset Tokyo 5-4
in the International Pool final earlier Thursday, for the Series
title on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McConn's power came as a bit of a surprise, but Haggard's
pitching did not. It was Haggard's second win of the Series after
he pitched a one-hitter -- coming within two outs of a perfect game
-- and struck out 12 in Sunday's 3-0 win over the East. Haggard also
earned a save in Tuesday's 4-2 preliminary round win over
Davenport.
</P>
<P>
   In 13 innings this week, he struck out 27. Little League
officials did not know if that was a Series record.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for Haggard, who qualified for All-Star play a week
before the deadline after breaking his wrist in a spring
snowboarding accident.
</P>
<P>
   And not bad for a Bellaire team that had previously never
advanced past district play.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Mirfield and Michael Johnson -- with his third of the series
-- also homered for Bellaire, which became the sixth Texas team to
reach the finals, and first since Spring in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended Davenport's heady run at the series, as the
Iowans not only ended a three-year Central Region losing streak,
but became the first Central team to reach the final since pool
play was introduced in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Davenport fell behind early and couldn't catch up,
especially against Haggard.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire struck for three runs in the first, and went up 4-0 on
McConn's solo shot in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport then mounted its lone threat in the fourth, loading
the bases with no outs. But Haggard struck out the next three
batters, and then struck out the first two in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire broke the game open with a four-run fourth, sparked by
McConn's three-run shot.
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo became the ninth Latin American team to reach the
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mavarez's three-run homer keyed a four-run second inning
for Maracaibo, while Marcel Prado squelched Tokyo's mighty offense,
allowing five hits and striking out nine.
</P>
<P>
   It was a big finish for Maracaibo, which has been on a wild ride
since the team's flight from Venezuela ran into mechanical problems
and had to return home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once again, trust in God,'' manager Eduvino Quevedo said,
speaking through interpreter Luis Sanchez. ''And this is a team
that has a bunch of fighters. They're from a very poor neighborhood
in Maracaibo and they don't give up very easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo beat a Tokyo team -- representing the defending
champion Far East -- that appeared untouchable, having rolled
through the preliminary round with a 3-0 record, while outscoring
its opposition 28-8.
</P>
<P>
   Down 5-1, Tokyo rallied for three runs in the fifth but came up
empty in the sixth, sparking a wild celebration on the field and
among the small contingent of Venezuelan fans in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo is the first Latin American team to reach the finals
since Guadalupe, Mexico, won it all 1997. All nine Venezuelan
Series entries have come from Maracaibo.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead 2-0 in the second, Mavarez smacked starter Kazuma Yamada's
pitch an estimated 208 feet over the centerfield wall.
</P>
<P>
   Prado, who gave up six runs to Tokyo on Sunday, wasn't
intimidated facing it again.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knew that the first game, he didn't throw one-fourth of
what he's capable of,'' Prado said through Sanchez. ''I feel very
good, very happy that we won, because my initial goal was to take
the team to the Latin American championships. And my second goal
was to get to the world championships and win it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo manager Masumi Ohmae credited Prado.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really threw a good game. That was the difference,'' Ohmae
said. ''Of course, having hit so well against him previously did
give us confidence. I don't know if it was necessarily
overconfidence, but we had confidence in our hitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo's Leo Nakayama had two hits, scored twice and drove in one
run, finishing the Series 8-for-10 with 11 runs scored and eight
RBIs.

<HEADLINE> Aryan Nations Threatened by Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
By NICHOLAS K. GERANIOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   COEUR D'ALENE, Idaho (AP) -- A lawyer who specializes in
bankrupting hate groups is going after the Aryan Nations, whose
compound in the Idaho woods has served as a clubhouse for some of
America's most violent racists.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit that goes to trial Monday, attorney Morris Dees of
the Southern Poverty Law Center is representing a mother and son
who were attacked by security guards for the white supremacist
group. The victims are suing the Aryan Nations and founder Richard
Butler.
</P>
<P>
   ''Put them out of business, that's what we try to do,'' Dees
said when the lawsuit was filed last year. He has declined
additional comment.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said the lawsuit was brought by enemies of the white
race.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the way it is for the white man today,'' Butler, 82,
said Wednesday. ''I think it's a rape of the American justice
system.''
</P>
<P>
   The case has its origins on July 1, 1998, when Victoria Keenan,
43, and her son Jason, 20, were driving on a country road near
Hayden Lake. Their car backfired as it passed the Aryan Nations'
20-acre compound.
</P>
<P>
   Security guards for the Aryan Nations mistook the backfire for a
gunshot, piled into a truck and chased the Keenans, who are part
white, part American Indian, for two miles. They fired five bullets
into the Keenan car and forced it off the road. Both Keenans were
punched and threatened at gunpoint before the guards backed off.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the guards were convicted of assault and are in prison. A
third remains a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   The Keenans are alleging assault, false imprisonment and
emotional distress at the hands of the guards, who they contend
were agents of the Aryan Nations. They are seeking an unspecified
amount in compensatory and punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Butler and his attorney Edgar Steele are expected to argue that
he should not be held liable for the actions of the volunteer
security guards. Steele did not return a call.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents, Steele described the security guards as
''borderline derelicts'' who were not under Butler's control.
</P>
<P>
   Butler's beliefs should not be used against him, the defense
documents said, ''Demonizing Jews is still legal under the First
Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Dees has long used lawsuits to destroy the finances of hate
groups. In six such lawsuits, the Montgomery, Ala., lawyer has
never lost.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Dees won a $7 million verdict against a Ku Klux Klan
organization over the slaying of a 19-year-old black man in Mobile,
Ala., forcing the group to turn over its headquarters building. In
1990, he won $9 million in Portland, Ore., against the White Aryan
Resistance in the beating death of a black man by neo-Nazi
skinheads.
</P>
<P>
   The Portland case is similar to the Keenan lawsuit, in that Dees
argued that White Aryan Resistance founders Tom and John Metzger
incited the skinheads to commit murder.
</P>
<P>
   Dees has received death threats in the past, so the Southern
Poverty Law Center will have its own security force to augment the
tight security promised by Kootenai County authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Butler is pastor of the Church of Jesus Christ Christian, which
holds that whites are the true children of God, that Jews are the
offspring of Satan and that blacks and other minorities are
inferior. He presides over weekly services in a chapel where an
Israeli flag is used as a doormat.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, his disciples have included some of the most
notorious figures in the white supremacist movement, such as Robert
Mathews, Randy Weaver and Buford Furrow, a former security guard at
the Aryan Nations compound who is awaiting trial in Los Angeles on
charges of killing an Asian-American postal carrier and shooting up
a Jewish day care center last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, however, has been largely able to escape jail time. In
1988 he was acquitted of federal charges that he was involved in a
plot to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   People who study hate groups consider Butler a godfather of the
white supremacist movement.
</P>
<P>
   From his compound, which is valued at about $200,000 and has a
sign out front that reads ''Whites only,'' Butler mails his
literature, recruits followers and plays host to the annual Aryan
World Congress, a skinhead symposium that often draws more than 100
acolytes. The gathering is generally held on Adolf Hitler's
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Butler said the possible loss of his home ''bothers me a little
bit.'' He is appealing for defense funds from neo-Nazi
sympathizers, writing on his Web site: ''We must not let the
enemies of our race win this round.''
</P>
<P>
   Six distributors of skinhead music are donating proceeds from
the sale of CDs with titles like ''Too White for You,'' and
''Holocaust 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Bertollini, a wealthy former computer executive who
lives in nearby Sandpoint, Idaho, sent a mailing to thousands of
Idaho households last week attacking Dees as an ''anti-white, Jew
supremacist.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Just think about it,'' Bertollini's mailing said. ''A Jew team
of lawyers trying to destroy a white Christian church.''
</P>
<P>
   Dees is not Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Aryan Nations are looking forward to seeing the
group punished.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wassmuth, whose Coeur d'Alene home was once bombed by white
supremacists, said it is important to hold leaders of hate groups
responsible for the actions of their followers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Will a successful outcome eliminate hate groups in the
Northwest? No,'' Wassmuth said. ''Will it have an impact? Most
certainly.''

<HEADLINE> Eagles Sign Safety Tim Hauck  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Safety Tim Hauck agreed to terms with the
Philadelphia Eagles on a one-year contract Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''His signing has no impact on Damon Moore, who earned a
starting job as strong safety,'' Eagles coach Andy Reid said. ''Tim
has the ability to fill in at both safety spots and that's what
we're bringing him in here to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Hauck, an 11-year veteran, played in all 16 games, with 15
starts at strong safety, a year ago, and established a career high
with 122 tackles. He also had his first career interception in the
season finale against St. Louis on Jan. 2.

<HEADLINE> Leaders Grandson Visits China Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FENGHUA, China (AP) -- The grandson of China's World War II
leader and Taiwan's former strongman Chiang Kai-shek visited the
family's ancestral home in eastern China for the first time
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   John Chang toured the traditional courtyard house in the town of
Fenghua, now a museum to the former leader who fled to Taiwan in
1949 after Mao Tse-tung's communists ousted Chiang's Nationalists
from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, 58, paid his respects before the graves of his
grandmother and great grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have waited many years to make this visit and feel very
happy and very moved,'' Chang told reporters at the Fenghua home,
south of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
   Chang expressed hope for reconciliation between China and
Taiwan, which Beijing claims as unrecovered territory. However, he
insisted his visit had ''pure motives'' and did not intend to send
a political message.
</P>
<P>
   Chang now holds no public office. He formerly served as Taiwan's
foreign minister and as secretary general of his grandfather's
Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
   He is the son of Chiang Ching-kuo, who succeeded his father,
Chiang Kai-shek, as Taiwan's president. His mother was the Chiang
family tutor and never married his father. Chang uses his mother's
surname.
</P>
<P>
   The Nationalist Party his family led lost the presidency in
March, ending their 51 years of rule over Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Chiang Kai-shek led China's Nationalist government in attempts
to unite the fractured nation and resist Japanese invaders. From
Taiwan, he nurtured the dream of returning a conquering hero, but
died on the island in 1975, no closer to realizing that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Chiang was reviled for decades by China's communist rulers as a
corrupt puppet of the United States. But the criticisms have
abated.

<HEADLINE> EPA recommends taking dump off Superfund list  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARWICK, N.Y. (AP) - With cleanup finished, the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency is proposing taking the town
landfill federal Superfund site off the National Priorities List of
hazardous waste sites.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA considers the 19-acre landfill in Orange County, 46
miles north of New York City, no longer a threat to human health
and the environment. It was used by the town from the mid 1950s
until 1977 and evidence showed some hazardous material was dumped
there.
</P>
<P>
   A New York State Department of Environmental Conservation
examination found some heavy metals, volatile organic compounds and
phenols. It was closed in 1979 and listed as a Superfund site in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   A long-term remedy completed in 1998 included capping the
landfill, groundwater sampling and monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is seeking public comment on the recommendation. Sites
deleted from the NPL remain eligible for additional cleanup
activities that may become necessary.

<HEADLINE> Former UPI White House reporter Thomas remembers presidents  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MARGATE, N.J. (AP) - Helen Thomas had the same advice for all of
the presidents she covered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would tell each new president to stop, look and listen,''
Thomas said before a packed auditorium at the Jewish Community
Center in Margate Thursday night. ''We can give presidents plenty
of advice, but we have to let them make their own mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, who covered the White House and Washington for 57 years
for United Press International, shared some of her insights into
the character of American presidents.
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy, she said, grew most in his brief tenure as
president, and revealed perhaps the greatest depth. Bill Clinton
has not received his share of credit for the current American
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Lyndon Johnson's comments she couldn't print, and
Franklin D. Roosevelt was probably the best leader.
</P>
<P>
   All of them disliked the press.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are the self-appointed, self-anointed watchdogs of
democracy,'' she said, speaking of the press. ''Some people think
we have co-opted the First Amendment for our own uses, but that's
not true. We are it's staunchest defenders.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the current presidential race, Thomas called it close. Al
Gore has tried to distance himself from Clinton, with only partial
success. And George W. Bush has portrayed himself as a
compassionate conservative, she said, but ''you can't prove it by
me ... He's surrounded himself with Cold War hawks from the Reagan
era, looking for the second act.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why she left the wire service, Thomas said, ''I thought it
was time to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas spoke as part of the JCC's Distinguished Political
Lecture series.

<HEADLINE> Pataki takes in the fair; picketers march outside front gate  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - With a sparkling summer day as the
backdrop, Gov. George Pataki and tens of thousands of people headed
to the opening Thursday of the 2000 New York State Fair, out for a
day of fun and frolic.
</P>
<P>
   For about 200 people, though, visiting the fair was strictly
business.
</P>
<P>
   Corrections officers from around the state picketed outside the
main gate for several hours as Pataki toured the fair.
</P>
<P>
   The state's prison guards have been working without a contract
since April 1, 1999. In July, the union's 24,000 members barely
defeated a proposed four-year contract offering a salary increase
totaling 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said the contract still left New York corrections
officers paid $10,000 to $20,000 less than their counterparts in
other states.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the governor is trying to blackmail us by not paying our 3
percent retirement enhancement benefits because we didn't ratify
the contract,'' said Richard Harcrow, assistant to the president of
the New York State Correctional Officers &AMP; Police Benevolent
Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''We won't stand for it. We will follow him from Albany to
Buffalo and wherever until we get a fair, respectable contract,''
Harcrow said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The contract offered ... is a fair contract that recognizes
the important work of our corrections officers while protecting the
taxpayers,'' said Suzanne Morris, a spokeswoman for Pataki.
</P>
<P>
   Morris noted the same contract received resounding ratification
by all other state employee unions, including corrections
supervisors, and was defeated by the union membership by only a
small margin.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, negotiations between the state and union have moved
into fact-finding, a stage under state law in which a mediator
holds hearings and then makes a recommendation for a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive year a statewide union protested
over no contract during the governor's annual appearance at the
fair.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, members of the Civil Service Employees Association
and Public Employees Federations, the two largest state employee
unions, shouted down Pataki during the opening ceremony and then
chased him around the fairgrounds as the governor walked through
the displays and exhibits. Both unions have since settled on a
contract, leaving corrections officers as one of the last unions
still seeking to reach a new contract with the state.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, corrections officers stayed outside the main gate.
Walking wide circles around the base of the towering state fair
sign, each carrying a sign, they chanted, ''We want a fair
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki arrived by a side gate on another side of the fairgrounds
and did not see the demonstrators. Inside, the governor helped open
the 154th edition of the state fair and then toured the fair,
mixing in some business of his own.
</P>
<P>
   After sitting through a new multimedia exhibit by Eastman Kodak
Co. that highlights the state's 11 vacation regions, Pataki walked
through the Center of Progress building greeting surprised
fairgoers. He took a quick stroll through the Pan-African Village
and later grabbed a sausage sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   He also helped launch a recycling awareness program at the fair,
presented the New York State Apple Association with a $250,000
assistance check and signed into law the Agricultural Environmental
Management Program, which will assist farmers in developing and
carrying out environmental management plans that comply with
federal and state soil and water quality regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Fair officials hoping to crack the 1 million mark in attendance
for the first time were thrilled with Thursday's opening day record
of 74,385 attendees, breaking the mark set in 1998 by 11,000.
</P>
<P>
   Another record was set at the grandstand where 17,141 listened
to Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-day fair runs through Labor Day. Fair officials believe
they can crack the 1 million mark in attendance with good weather
like on Thursday, when skies were partly sunny and the temperature
was in the mid-70s. The all-time record crowd was set last year
when 959,408 people attended the fair.

   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian doctors have given California businessman
Dennis Tito a clean bill of health for space travel, bringing him
closer to becoming a ''space tourist,'' according to the company
arranging the journey.
</P>
<P>
   MirCorp, a private company which arranged for Tito to fly to the
aging Mir space station, said in a statement Wednesday that Tito
will now start training at Russia's Star City space facility.
</P>
<P>
   The blastoff is scheduled for mid-2001, according to MirCorp.
</P>
<P>
   Tito has agreed to pay approximately $20 million to blast off
with two Russian cosmonauts and fly for brief a visit to Mir,
MirCorp has said. The trim, energetic 59-year-old says the weeklong
mission will fulfill a childhood dream of flying to space.
</P>
<P>
   Tito is a former rocket scientist from Santa Monica, Calif., and
will alternate training with trips home to run his investment firm,
the MirCorp statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Tito's planned trip is one of several commercial projects
designed to keep the 14-year-old Mir in orbit after government
finances dried up.

Mexico's Fox Meets Gore in US
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox drew praise from Al
Gore and George W. Bush today, but the two presidential aspirants'
neighborliness was mixed with reservations -- especially from Bush -- about
Fox's proposal to eventually open the U.S.-Mexican border. On a visit rife with
political overtones both north and south of the border, Fox spent an hour with
Gore strolling the grounds of the vice president's official residence, then went
to the White House for an Oval Office meeting with President Clinton. He will
meet with Bush on Friday in Texas.

NHTSA: Broader Tire Recall Possible

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is investigating the safety of Firestone
tires beyond the 6.5 million that have been recalled, opening the possibility of
a broader recall. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said today
its investigation includes all 47 million ATX, ATX II and Wilderness brands. New
NHTSA Administrator Sue Bailey, who came on the job Monday, would not discuss
specifics of the investigation but said, ''If we feel there is a defect
affecting safety, we will issue a recall.''

   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- The head of the nation's accident investigation agency

after touring the site of the country's deadliest pipeline disaster in decades.
''Very few of our citizens know in how close a proximity they live, work, and in
this case, play to these pipelines,'' said Jim Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board. Eleven people were killed and another was
critically injured Saturday when a pipeline exploded near their campsite along

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- America's schoolchildren are doing a little better in
mathematics than they were a decade ago, but for many of them reading and
science skills have declined slightly since 1992. The government's 1999 National
Assessment of Education Progress also shows a widening gap in the test
performance of white and black elementary school students on reading, math and
science. And black 17-year-olds on average are still four years behind whites in
their reading skills. The Education Department report paints a mixed picture of
improving and falling test scores and narrowing and widening learning gaps.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Republican National Committee collected almost
$800,000 in unregulated soft money donations from energy companies after George
W. Bush tapped Halliburton Co. chief executive Dick Cheney as his running mate.
Cheney headed the oil services company for five years after formerly serving in
Congress and as secretary of defense; Bush also is a former oil company
executive. Cheney resigned his post last week. The $791,100 in energy
contributions during the last week of July were part of the $25.2 million in
soft money donations the RNC took in last month -- half as much as they raised
during the previous six months.

the accident that sent an 83-year-old woman's car off a bridge and into a swamp,
where she lay for three days before being rescued. Scott Andrew Campbell, 21,
was charged with leaving the scene of an accident that resulted in injuries and
filing a false police report. Police said Campbell rear-ended Tillie Tooter's
car during the middle of the night on Aug. 12, sending it over a 40-foot-high
bridge. For three days, no one knew she lay underneath Interstate 595, in part
because Campbell allegedly told troopers that he hadn't hit another car.

<HEADLINE> Hotel Workers To Stage Walkout  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Thousands of Sydney hotel workers are
expected to walk off the job Sunday to stress their demands for a
special allowance to work during the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   The Liquor Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union (LHMU)
said Friday that workers would walk out of hotels across Sydney's
central business district in support of their claim. The union is
pressing for an industry-wide Olympic bonus of $550 (Australian),
about $310 (U.S.).
</P>
<P>
   Union assistant secretary Mark Boyd said the claim was
justifiable.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe 550 is justified because it's what members say the
period to them is worth,'' he said. ''People are very clearly going
to have transport issues and hotels are saying they need some
flexibility out of their work force, which the award doesn't allow.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are going to be asked to change rosters at short
notice, and clearly, the position of our members is if hotels want
changes for the Olympics period, they are going to have to pay for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd said the action could range from stop-work meetings to full
strikes, depending on the decisions of workers at the different
hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our campaign will continue until we reach agreements. If
nothing is resolved, there is no reason why the campaign won't
continue during the Olympic period,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The allowance would cover 8,000 hotel workers including
cleaners, porters, chefs, waiters, waitresses, receptionists, car
park attendants and stewards.

<HEADLINE> Animal Group's Ad Angers N.Y. Mayor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Advertisements that parody the dairy industry's
popular ''Got Milk?'' ads have outraged New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Two billboards by the People for the Ethical Treatment of
Animals depict Giuliani wearing a milk mustache and asking: ''Got
prostate cancer?'' The ad claims a connection between drinking milk
and prostate cancer, for which the mayor is being treated.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's tasteless and inappropriate to exploit my illness and
also takes advantage of my position as the mayor for advertising
purposes,'' Giuliani said Thursday. ''The message they're trying to
deliver just makes sense in their own zealous, out-of-control
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was considering suing PETA because the
organization was using his image in an advertisement without his
permission.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Harvard School of Public Health in April raised
the possibility that consuming lots of milk and other dairy
products could modestly increase the risk of prostate cancer. The
study stressed the case was far from settled and recommended
further study of calcium's effects on health.
</P>
<P>
   PETA targeted Wisconsin for the ad because it's ''America's
Dairyland, so it seems to be the perfect place to bring the message
that dairy products are horrible for human health, catastrophic for
the environment and a living nightmare for these cows and their
veal calf babies,'' said Bruce Friedrich, the group's vegetarian
campaign coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The milk industry pointed out that other research suggests dairy
products help fight high blood pressure, colon cancer and
osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   ''True to form, it's their typical insensitive way of misleading
the public for their own gain,'' said Debra Wendorf Boyke,
spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Milk Marketing Board.
</P>
<P>
   The animal-rights group has pulled previous ads that incited
controversy. A PETA ad campaign that urged college students to
drink beer instead of milk was pulled last spring because of
objections by Mothers Against Drunk Driving.

<HEADLINE> Navy Wraps Up Exercises on Vieques  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- The U.S. Navy will wrap up its
latest round of training Friday on Vieques island, the site of
recurrent protest over military exercises.
</P>
<P>
   The USS Harry S. Truman Battle Group moved out to sea for two
days as Hurricane Debby passed through. The storm did not hit
Puerto Rico. The Navy was to end exercises on Thursday but decided
to continue Friday to make up for lost time, said Lt. Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   No protesters were detained Thursday, Gordon said. In the first
week of exercises, which began Aug. 3, the Navy detained 43 people
who broke into the training ground.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, jets bombed the island range using inert ordnance,
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy owns two-thirds of the 5-by-20-mile island and has used
it for exercises and weapons storage since the 1940s. Resentment
over the Navy's presence flared in April 1999, when a jet dropped
two bombs off target and killed a civilian guard on the bombing
range.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters, who charge the exercises have hampered development
and hurt people's health, camped out on the bombing range and
thwarted exercises until federal marshals removed them in May.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has promised the Navy will leave by May 2003
if the island's 9,400 residents vote to expel it in a referendum
expected next year. He ordered the Navy to stop using live bombs.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 11, Indians 7  </HEADLINE>
By TOM WITHERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Terrence Long's first grand slam and
career-high six RBIs Thursday night helped the Oakland Athletics
avoid a sweep and salvage the final game of a rough road trip with
an 11-7 win over the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Long, who has tormented the Indians the past week, went 3-for-6
and rookie Barry Zito (2-2) pitched 6 2-3 innings for his first win
in six starts as the A's went 2-5 on a swing through Detroit and
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Despite winning for just the sixth time in 18 games, Oakland
moved within 2&AMP;frac12; games of first-place Seattle in the AL West. The
Mariners lost in Detroit 10-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians completed a six-game homestand at 5-1, but missed a
chance to gain ground on Chicago in the AL Central. Cleveland
remained seven games behind the White Sox, who have led the
division by at least 6&AMP;frac12; games since June 16.
</P>
<P>
   When the A's swept the Indians last week at Oakland, Long went
5-for-7, made two diving catches in center and hit a game-winning,
two-run double in the ninth in the series finale.
</P>
<P>
   He got two hits in each of the first two games of this series
before hitting his slam and a two-run single in his first two
at-bats against Steve Woodard (0-2).
</P>
<P>
   Long went 12-for-24 (.500) with nine RBIs against the Indians
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Zito, a first-round draft pick in '99, allowed three runs and
five hits. He walked six -- four in one inning -- and struck out
eight.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs, who entered the game with the AL's worst batting
average (.214) had three hits, and Jason Giambi returned after
missing five games to drive in two runs.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui had two RBIs for the Indians, who went 3-for-15 with
runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   Long's first career slam capped Oakland's five-run second inning
off Woodard, who forced in the A's first run by walking No. 9
hitter Sal Fasano on four pitches with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Woodard fell behind 3-1 ad then grooved fastball to Long, who
lined it into the Oakland bullpen to make it 5-2 and snap a
50-inning homerless drought for the A's. Stairs helped set up the
inning by surprising the Indians with a bunt down the third-base
line.
</P>
<P>
   Long added a two-run single in the third and the A's added
another run to go up 8-2 in the inning when catcher Sandy Alomar
dropped Segui's throw home.
</P>
<P>
   Giambi, who sat out five games with a strained left shoulder,
put the A's up 10-2 by doubling in two runs in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Zito hadn't won since beating Anaheim in his major league debut
on July 22. The lefty was lucky to get out of the first inning down
just 2-0 after walking four -- one intentionally.
</P>
<P>
   With one out and the bases loaded, Zito struck out Travis Fryman
but Segui dropped a two-run single into center.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland scored three runs in the ninth off Jason Isringhausen
before Jim Mecir got the final out for his second save.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Oakland's 11 grand slams this season are a franchise record
and one shy of the major league mark shared by Atlanta (1997) and
Cleveland ('99). ... Oakland had lost 10 of its last 11 road games.
... Segui has hit safely in 13 straight games. ... The Indians tied
a club record when John McDonald entered at short in the seventh.
Injuries have forced Cleveland to use 53 players this season,
matching the mark set by the 1991 club. ... Indians catcher Einar
Diaz, a converted third baseman, played third for the first time in
his major league career. He last played third for Triple-A Buffalo
in 1997. ... Oakland committed three errors, giving the A's a major
league-leading 116.

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Donovan McNabb spent most of the night
wearing a baseball cap and Rob Johnson didn't even dress for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   It was an uneventful evening for the starting quarterbacks as
the Buffalo Bills beat the Philadelphia Eagles 16-12 Thursday night
in the preseason finale for both teams.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's McNabb was on the field for just four plays,
completed one pass and threw an interception. Johnson, meanwhile,
wore shorts, stood on the sidelines and joked around with
teammates.
</P>

   Alex Van Pelt, Johnson's replacement, was 15-of-28 for 163
yards, and rookie Sammy Morris ran for 101 yards and one touchdown
to lead the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Christie's 30-yard field goal with 8:47 remaining lifted
Buffalo to its third victory in four games. Christie was helped off
the field after getting hit on a 33-yarder with 27 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Trainers examined his kicking leg, and he had to be helped to
the locker after the game. The extent of the injury wasn't
immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   David Akers had field goals of 42, 33, 42 and 45 yards for
Philadelphia (1-3). But Akers, who made a 48-yard game-winning
field goal last week, missed a 36-yarder with 4:51 remaining that
would have given the Eagles a lead.
</P>
<P>
   McNabb, who threw three first-half touchdowns in last week's
34-32 victory over Tennessee, threw an interception on the first
play of the team's opening drive, and failed to move the offense on
the next series.
</P>
<P>
   After Corey Moore blew past Jon Runyan for a sack, McNabb's
evening was over.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Buffalo coach Wade Phillips elected to sit Johnson
rather than risk an injury to his starter on the artificial turf at
Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Flutie, Johnson's backup, is nursing a groin injury, and
also didn't play. Johnson threw three touchdowns in Buffalo's 31-27
victory over the St. Louis Rams last week, and had a 125.0 rating
in three exhibition games.
</P>
<P>
   Morris' 6-yard run with 33 seconds left in the first half capped
a seven-play, 62-yard drive and gave Buffalo a 10-6 lead. Morris,
who had four carries entering the game, ran 27 times. He also had
one catch for 30 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A 27-yard over-the-shoulder catch by Kwame Cavil set up the
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Koy Detmer replaced McNabb and was 0-for-4. Former Notre Dame
star Ron Powlus, fighting for a roster spot with Philadelphia, was
8-of-15 for 74 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Brown was 6-of-9 for 123 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Mitchell, who tortured the Eagles for years as a returner
with Washington, had his longest punt return of the preseason, a
29-yarder in the first quarter. He also recovered a fumble for
Philadelphia, and ran for 28 yards on two carries.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Rossum fumbled away a punt that would have given
Philadelphia the ball at their 40 with 3:23 left.

<HEADLINE> Cancer rate lower at contaminated school  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ELMIRA, N.Y. (AP) - Despite assurances that the cancer rate is
low at a high school built atop contaminated ground, residents here
still worry about sending their children to school.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials Wednesday night presented data showing
the overall cancer rate among current and former students at
Southside High School was lower than what would be expected
statistically, except for a group of students found to have
testicular cancer since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said that although chemical contaminants are
contained in the soil surrounding the school - including chromium,
nickel and PCBs - they do not pose a health threat. Air and water
samples obtained inside and outside the school also were normal.
</P>
<P>
   The school is on property that was home to manufacturing
facilities for more than a century. Parents raised concerns when
several current or former students developed cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a safe place for kids to attend school,'' said Andy
Carlson, director of the Health Department's Bureau of
Environmental Exposure and Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   More tests are expected on the surrounding area.
</P>
<P>
   Residents were skeptical about health department findings that
counted only 22 confirmed cases of cancer among students while they
attended or after they left the school. Local people have said the
number may be as high as 46. Three confirmed cases had cancer
before entering the school. Three students were found to have
testicular cancer since 1997.
