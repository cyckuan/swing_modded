<HEADLINE> LDPR Barred From Elections, Zhirinovsky Vows to Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia's Central Election
Commission on Monday threw out the ultranationalist Liberal
Democratic Party (LDPR) from the upcoming parliamentary elections
and LDPR leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky vowed to appeal to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
The decision to deny registration to the LDPR was approved by
13 Commission members on the ground that two of the top three LDPR
candidates, Anatoly Bykov and Mikhail Musatov, had submitted false
information concerning their personal incomes and properties, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Bykov failed to state that he has an old brick house with a
total floor space of 610 square meters, while Musatov did not
declare his three Mercedes cars that he owned, the Itar-Tass news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A total of 35 candidates were removed from the LDPR list for
similar reasons.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's elections law, a party will be denied
registration and participation in the elections for December 19 if
only one of the leading three candidates was denied registration.
</P>
<P>
Zhirinovsky, the leading candidate, expressed the confidence
that the Supreme Court will overrule this decision.
</P>
<P>
He said that his party has "the legal right to hold a congress
and confirm a new list," saying that the new list will be
different and will not arouse any questions in the Central
Election Commission.

<HEADLINE> Rome's Air and Railway Traffic in Chaos Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Air and railway traffic in the
Italian capital of Rome was in utter chaos on Monday after the
Rome's International Airport ran out of jet fuel and the new
electronic control system for the central railway station of Rome
went haywire when it was inaugurated Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
The most serious situation was at Fiumicino, the Rome's
International Airport where flights had to be canceled or
re-routed because of the lack of fuel.
</P>
<P>
The airport has two suppliers of kerosene needed for jet
engines, but one of them has not been sending in its quota because
its refinery was were undergoing three- year maintenance.
</P>
<P>
Taking the heat for the fuel shortage was the Seram company
that stores the fuels sent by the two suppliers and checks for
quality.
</P>
<P>
Given that the refinery closing had been scheduled, it unclear
why Seram did not compensate with other sources and allowed its
reserves to dry up.
</P>
<P>
Seram has defended itself by saying that it had informed the
competent authorities of the shortage and recently notified
airport administration that a state of emergency existed.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Board of Airline Representatives, that group's
together carriers operating at Fiumicino, was particularly
outraged by the situation and its chairman, Godwin Miceli, issued
a statement that "It is unheard of and incomprehensible that an
efficient international airport like Fiumicino can see things like
this happen."
</P>
<P>
"What occurred today represented a major problem to passengers
and for all the airline companies operating at Fiumicino," Miceli
continued, "Some were forced to divert their planes to other
airports for re-fueling in order to continue their flights and
this at a great additional cost".
</P>
<P>
At Rome's central railway station, the malfunctioning of the
new rail traffic control system caused havoc for passengers who
faced hours of delays while those stuck on trains outside the city
were often not informed on how long they could expect to wait.
</P>
<P>
The station was re-opened Monday morning after being closed for
two days to allow for the installment of the new system.
</P>
<P>
Rail traffic was thus diverted to the city's smaller station
where long lines at ticket counters and overcrowding aggravated
the situation marked by long delays and short tempers.

<HEADLINE> Marconi Unveils New Public Network at Telecom 99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Marconi Communications, the
world's leading broadband transmission supplier, unveils its
vision of the New Public Network at this week's Telecom '99
exhibition in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Together with its fellow GEC company FORE Systems, the UK-based
Marconi has developed a network comprising a uniquely powerful
combination of WDM (wave division multiplexing), IP (internet
protocol) and ATM (asynchronous transfer mode) technologies in
preparation for the high-bandwidth applications needs of the
future, according to a Marconi press release here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Marconi has already captured one-third of the total market for
SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) transmission systems. It added
to its transmission capability when its parent GEC purchased the
former RELTEC Corporation which has strength in the United States'
equivalent of SDH, known as SONET. GEC then completed the
purchase of FORE Systems, a world leader in ATM switching, and
this combination of expertise across a converging market is
allowing Marconi to deliver a complete solution.
</P>
<P>
"The Marconi name carries a noble heritage and thanks to our
hard-won reputation in broadband transmission, plus the support
and vision of GEC, it has an even more important future as the
world moves forward," said Chief Executive Officer of Marconi
Communications, Mike Parton.
</P>
<P>
"We have the technologies to make it happen. We have the people
to make it happen. And visitors to our stand will have the
opportunity to see for themselves the unique capability we have
created."
</P>
<P>
Marconi began to set foot on the Chinese market in 1989. It has
now two factories in Shanghai and one in Beijing and in Guangzhou
and an R&AMP;D center in Chengdu.

<HEADLINE> Iran Reiterates Support for Anti-Israeli Struggles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President
Hashemi Rafsanjani on Monday reiterated Iran's support for the
Lebanese Hezbollah guerrilla group, or Party of God, to fight
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Hassan Nasrullah, secretary general of the
Hezbollah, Rafsanjani termed the struggles of Lebanese and
Palestinian people against Israel as "legitimate," the Islamic
Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war against the
Israeli occupation troops since they set up a self-styled security
zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its
north from Lebanese guerrillas cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iran is seriously following up issues of Jerusalem, the
liberation of south Lebanon from Israeli occupation and the
restoration of the rights of the oppressed Palestinian and
Lebanese nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, currently chairman of the State Expediency Council,
called for consolidation of unity among "groups whose objective
is to liberate the occupied lands and the holy Al-Qods
(Jerusalem)."
</P>
<P>
The issues concerning the Palestinians, Jerusalem and south
Lebanon are Islamic international issues which are given due by
over 1 billion Muslims, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Judiciary Chief Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi
Shahroudi also said that struggle against Israel is an Islamic
principle, because the entity is not only the symbol of global
arrogance in the region, but also a center for fighting against
Islam.
</P>
<P>
In a separate meeting with Nasrullah, Shahroudi said that
Zionism seeks to dominate the whole world and has put struggle
against sovereignty of Islam on its agenda.
</P>
<P>
He said that confronting Israel is a fundamental Islamic duty
besides being a patriotic and national responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the peace deal between the Palestinian National
Authority and Israel, Shahroudi said peace with the Israelis is
meaningless because they violate all treaties if they find an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli regime is not serious even in this kind of peace
deal and is after a peace that would humiliate Palestinians and
Muslims, he said, adding that due to the same reason, it has
announced Al-Qods as its permanent base.

<HEADLINE> WB to Send Mission to Mozambique on Debt Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The World Bank representative in Maputo, James Coates, said
Monday, "the mission is coming to assess everything, from the
Maputo Development Corridor, to the exports not only of cashew
nuts but also cotton."
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Parliament passed a law in September to protect the
cashew processing industry in the southern African country, which
has triggered off concerns that it might cost the country billions
of U.S. dollars debt relief from the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries) debt relief initiative.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank official refused to give a definite "yes" or
"no" to the question whether further linkages will be imposed
between debt relief and the cashew trade, which is one of the most
important foreign exchange earners of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, Mozambique reached the completion point of
the HIPC (Heavily Indebted Poor Countries ) debt relief
initiative, under which 1.7 billion U.S. dollars (in net present
value terms) was supposed to be wiped off its debt stock.
</P>
<P>
The Cologne debt initiative, proposed by the G7 group of most
industrialized nations. promises to provide additional debt
relief, Mozambican finance Minister Tomaz Salomao believes this
could lift the total amount of debt cancelled to two billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
This new scheme, also referred to as enhanced HIPC, attached
condition that the extra debt relief will only be available to
countries which faithfully follows their structural adjustment
agreements with the IMF and World Bank.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect Mozambique's cashew processing industry,
the parliament passed in September bill to increases the surtax on
exports of raw, unprocessed cashew from the current 14 percent to
between 18 and 22 percent in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Liberalizing the cashew trade was one of the many conditions
the world financial institutions set for Mozambique's eligibility
for HIPC initiative.

UNITED NATIONS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Monday said that it is necessary to start considering a
transition to post-conflict peace-building in the Central African
Republic.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council, which was issued here
Monday, Annan said that the political climate in the country
remains tense and the restructuring of the armed forces has seen
little progress.
</P>
<P>
The security situation in the region also needs to be taken
into consideration, he said. Therefore, the U.N. chief recommended
a short but gradual transition from peacekeeping to post-conflict
peace-building.
</P>
<P>
During this transition, the U.N. peacekeepers in the country,
known as MINURCA, would gradually reduce its military strength,
until February 15, 2000, and would continue to provide assistance
in the implementation of major reforms and its good offices to
promote reconciliation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jordan Cancels Israeli Minister's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan Monday canceled a
visit to Amman by Israel's industry and trade minister in reaction
to Israel's improper treatment to a Jordanian parliamentary
delegation, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Ran Cohen had been slated to visit Amman Wednesday. The
Jordanian side canceled the visit because its parliamentary
delegation was humiliated by Israeli security forces and Jewish
settlers Saturday in Hebron, the radio added.
</P>
<P>
This development showed that Jordan was really angered by the
Hebron incident. During the last two days, Jordan has lodged at
least two protests to the Israeli side, accusing Israel for
violating the international diplomatic practice.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred Saturday when the 20-member Jordanian
parliamentary delegation led by Lower House Speaker Abdul- Hadi
Majali visited Hebron, the last stop of their four-day visit to
the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The delegation had planned to pray at the Tomb of the
Patriarchs, which is sacred to Muslims and Jews, but was forced to
turn back after Israeli security forces insisted that they pass
through metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
While leaving the scene, the Jordanian lawmakers were heckled
by about 15 Jewish settlers who shouted in Arabic "Abu Jihad is
dead," referring to the military chief of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization who was assassinated in 1988 in an
operation widely attributed to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soliders pushed the settlers away and Majali's
bodyguard rushed him into his black Mercedes. Several settlers
followed Majali, surrounded his car and banged on it with their
fists.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the incident, Majali said the Jordan's trust in the
peace process has been shaken by the incident.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side gave a different explanation of the incident,
saying that the delegation did not contact the Israeli side about
the visit to the shrine.
</P>
<P>
But Cohen, who is from the left-wing Meretz party, slammed the
Jewish settlers for the heckling, saying the incident might harm
the close Israeli-Jordanian relations.
</P>
<P>
The Tomb of the Patriarchs is in the Israeli-controlled part of
Hebron, which was divided into two parts under an
Israeli-Palestinian agreement in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Surrounded by about 130,000 Palestinians, more than 400 Jewish
settlers live in the heart of the city with heavy protection of
the Israeli troops.

<HEADLINE> 14 Militant Suspects Tried in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 11 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian security court Monday
began the trial of 14 Islamic militants charged with killing 14
policemen and civilians.
</P>
<P>
During the procedural session, court officials read the charges
to the defendants that they had breached public order, joined an
illegal group, undermined freedoms and endangered national unity,
Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were also accused of injuring 40 others,
attacking police stations and robbing banks in the incidents which
took place between 1994 and 1996 in the southern governorates of
Menia, Beni Suef and Fayyoum, strongholds of the militants, the
news agency said. Many of the charges are punishable by death.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors presented the court with large quantities of arms
and anti-government documents which had been found with the
defendants as evidence, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report did not say which illegal group the defendants
belong to, but they are believed to be members of the al-Gamma
al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group, which launched an insurgency in
1992 in an attempt to topple the secular Egyptian government and
install a strict Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
The government has largely contained the violence by stepping
up security efforts, especially in the south, and arresting
hundreds of the suspected militants and putting them on trial.
</P>
<P>
The court decided to reopen the trial on November 9.

<HEADLINE> Investments in Mutual Funds Grow in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The value of the mutual
funds' net assets in Romania went up 8.8 percent last September,
the official Rompres news agency quoted National Union of
Collective Investment Organizations as informing.
</P>
<P>
The number of investors in mutual funds went up 6.6 percent
last September, and the number of participation titles grew 4.7
percent. In terms of net assets reported last September, leading
in the mutual funds' standings is the National Investments Fund
with 1,898.347 billion lei (about 115.541 million U.S. dollars at
end September).
</P>
<P>
Since this year's beginning, the value of participation titles
in the mutual funds soared 114.3 percent. The national currency
leu lost 50.6 percent to the US dollar in the same period, and the
inflation rate was around 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are 15 open investments funds in Romania now, that total
well-nigh 200,000 investors and net assets of 2,339.858 billion
lei (4.414 million U.S. dollars). Over 36 percent of the value of
these mutual funds' assets are liquidities and almost 40 percent
consists of share that are not listed with the stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
The mutual funds' administrators e been more careful with the
structure of their assets and with lowering the risk of the
investments after the smashing fall of the Mutual Fund of
Businessmen, administered by SAFI Invest, in 1996, when the value
of the fund's titles plunged overnight, following the application
of a different scheme of calculation, in harmony with financial
realities instead of with the speculative value of the
certificates, employed before.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian depositors have for several years shunned these
funds' market, after having seen their savings turn to ashes
overnight. Only last summer have the Romanian investors dared
again choose this form of financial investment, all while the bank
interest rates stood still or even went down and the people's need
for gains has become more urgent against the background of a
declining living standard.

TEHRAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' resident
coordinator in Tehran Francesco Bastagli on Monday called for
precautionary measures to prevent casualties and damage in the
event of earthquake in the Iranian capital Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering marking the 1999 world disaster

said that according to experts, the question is not whether there
will be an earthquake in Tehran, but when it will occur.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the havoc wrought by the devastating earthquake in
western Turkey on August 17 that killed over 15,000 people, he
said people should be made aware of the potential dangers and
trained to respond to them.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official recommended to introduce and enforce
micro-zoning in Tehran, ensure high standards in building design,
and construction materials, produce quake-resistant building
materials and employ an effective and independent inspection
system.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced U.N. readiness to sign a new project to further
strengthen the national capacity in disaster response.
</P>
<P>
Iran is prone to earthquake and the last tremor that hit the
country in May 1997 killed 4,000 people.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilian Targets Bombed by U.S.-British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes on
Monday bombed some civilian installations in southern Iraq, said
an Iraqi military spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The unnamed spokesman said that at 8:15 hours (0515 GMT) and
14:00 hours (1100 GMT), a total of 25 formations of U.S. and
British warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated
southern Iraqi airspace over Basra, Thi-Qar, Qadissiya, Misan,
Muthana, Najaf and Wasit provinces.
</P>
<P>
These enemy planes bombed some civilian facilities in the
region, said the spokesman. He did not mention whether casualties
were caused.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired missiles at the
enemy planes and repulsed them to their bases in Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 13,751 sorties over the two no-fly

Iraqi civilian and military targets, said the spokesman.

<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south against attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<HEADLINE> Putin Dismisses Peace Deal, Threats From Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said Monday that the Russian leadership would not yield to any
pressure from the Chechen authorities or from the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
Putin said that Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov's recent
appeal for talks with Moscow and the renewed threats from Chechen
warlord Shamil Basayev "are parts of one scenario and one plan,"
the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"One of them is proposing talks, and the other is issuing
threats," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of this, the prime minister said, was "to cause
panic and to put pressure on the government and the president in
an attempt to put a halt to the active military operations in the
Caucasus."
</P>
<P>
Federal troops, conducting aerial and artillery bombing raids
over the breakaway republic, have reportedly secured control of
more than one third of the Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The offensive, the fiercest since the end of the 1994-1996
Chechen war, came after Chechen rebels infiltrated the neighboring
Daghestan republic in two waves and after four apartment building
blasts in Moscow and two other cities killed more than 300 people.
Chechen rebels were believed to be behind the explosions.
</P>
<P>
He said the federal authorities' operations in the North
Caucasus "took the terrorists by surprise."
</P>
<P>
"Our words are being backed with action and this took the
terrorists by surprise," Putin said. "They have realized that
their brazen sorties in Daghestan will cost them very dearly, and
that operations by criminal groupings in and outside Chechnya are
under threat."
</P>
<P>
He said that "the ringleaders of the militant formations are
pushing the population out, drawing the picture of a humanitarian
catastrophe."
</P>
<P>
In addition, they are "mobilizing attacks on the Russian
authorities through their agents abroad," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
Yegor Stroyev, speaker of Federation Council, the upper house
of parliament, said "Basayev and Maskhadov are trying to catch a
departing train."
</P>
<P>
"They have realized that the methods used in the previous war
did not work," the speaker said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Austria and Zimbabwe renewed
their cooperation agreement here on Monday, according to which
Austria will provide financial and manpower support to Zimbabwe in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Austria's Co-ordinator for Development Cooperation in Zimbabwe
Roland Angerer and Zimbabwe's Minister of Public Service, Labour
and Social Welfare Florence Chitauro signed the renewal of the
agreement that was first signed in 1982.
</P>
<P>
During the period of the initial agreement, Austria provided
technical and educational support through the provision of
expatriate teachers to rural secondary schools and this time it
would be focusing on environmental management, vocational training
and development of the small business sector.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the renewal of the agreement, Chitauro said the
involvement of the Austrian government in Zimbabwe had seen
emphasis shifting towards small business development, market
reforms, poverty alleviation and improvement of living conditions
of the underprivileged.
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Zimbabwe is part of its endeavors to provide
 financial and manpower support to developing countries to uplift
the economies and living conditions of the majority of the poor.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Service for Development Cooperation would be
working with the Institute of Water and Sanitation and
Environmental 2000 Foundation in raising awareness to the public
on the importance of protecting natural habitats and sustainable
use of natural resources.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Messenger of Peace to Visit Weapons Project in  Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Michael Douglas, who was
appointed United Nations Messenger of Peace on July 30, 1998, is
scheduled to visit the joint weapons for development project by
the U.N. Department of Disarmament Affairs and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Douglas will be accompanied by high-ranking Albanian Government
officials and UNDP officials, during his visit to the project site
in the district of Gramsh, Albania, U.N. officials said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Gramsh Pilot Project has collected around 6,700 small
weapons and 100 tons of ammunition since January 1999,
representing some 70 to 80 percent of the illegal weapons that
were looted in the district during the civil riots in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The project was inaugurated in November 1998, but the actual
collection of weapons began in January 1999 owing to the refugee
crisis caused by the conflict in Kosovo, a province in the
neighboring Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Throughout Albania, it is estimated that more than half a
million military weapons and many tons of ammunition had fallen
into the hands of the civilian population in the country, U.N.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In cooperation with the United Nations, the Albanian Government
undertook to engage in a program of weapons recovery, based on an
innovative approach of advocacy and provision of development to
voluntarily return the arms in their possession.
</P>
<P>
The Government is keen to replicate the initial success of the
Gramsh Pilot Project in other regions, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Douglas, who has spoken out as Messenger of Peace in favour of
greater controls over the illegal possession and circulation of
small arms and light weapons, will witness in Gramsh a mechanical
destruction of some of the weapons that have been collected and
inaugurated a road reconstruction project in the region.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the famous American film star follows on the heels
of a visit by U.N. under-secretary-general for disarmament,
Jayantha Dhanapala, on September 17.

<HEADLINE> Two Lebanese Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A pro-Israeli local militiaman
and a civilian were wounded Monday during exchanges of fire
between Lebanese guerrillas and Israeli military forces in
southern Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
A member of the pro-Israeli South Lebanon Army (SLA) was
wounded when his outpost in Bayadah village on the edge of
an Israeli-occupied border zone in south Lebanon was hit by
Hezbollah gurrillas' attack.
</P>
<P>
A villager was also injured when a bomb hit her house at the
same village, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon
in 1985 to protect its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops and its ally SLA out of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the SLA admitted Monday that one of
its members was killed last week during a clash with Lebanese
guerrillas in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The fatality raised to 19 the number of the militiamen killed
in the zone since the start of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Quebec police made four arrests
Monday in Montreal after protesting truckers refused to obey a
court injunction to call off a week-long blockade of highways.
</P>
<P>
"It will be zero tolerance for any roadside intimidation,"
Public Security Minister Serge Menard warned the protesters.
</P>
<P>
He said the government won't negotiate with the truckers unless
they lift the blockade.
</P>
<P>
The lastest information from the French speaking province said
that the protest joined by thousands at its peak has caused
shortages of food, gasoline and other essentials in outlying
regions.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, truckers in Montreal and in the Saguenay region of
Quebec voted to continue their protest for cheaper gas prices and
the right for independent drivers to form their own union.
</P>
<P>
Different groups of truckers have blocked roads throughout
Quebec, creating shortages of daily necessities in isolated areas
like La Tuque, according to Canadian media.

<HEADLINE> UN to Cooperate with S. Africa in Curbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and
South Africa were taking steps to finalize an agreement on curbing
corruption in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed in a message delivered on U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's behalf at an international
anti-corruption conference in Durban, South Africa, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
South African Justice Minister Penuell Maduna told reporters
that the initiative involved, among others, the training of police
officers and investigators to root out corruption.
</P>
<P>
Maduna said talks were also underway with other organizations,
countries and companies to beef up the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
Anan said in the message available here that while corruption
was a global problem it was especially destructive in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
"It has critically hobbled and skewed Africa's development.
There is no point in pretending that this is not true," Anan said.
</P>
<P>
He said although steps had been taken to rid countries of the
scourge, much more still needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
"African governments in particular must get tough on this issue
and make the fight against corruption a genuine priority."
</P>
<P>
Anan called on the Organization for African Unity to devise a
uniform african convention on the conduct of public officials and
the transparency of public administration by next year.
</P>
<P>
He quoted a recent International Monetary Fund study which
showed that countries with extensive corruption resulted in less
of their growth domestic product going into investment. They also
had lower growth rates.
</P>
<P>
"These same countries also invest less in education, which is
the best development guarantee for future generations," Anan said.
</P>
<P>
"When a bureaucracy, political party or judicial system becomes
infected (with corruption), the results can shake the foundations
of even the most advanced nations," he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 1000 delegates from around the world were attending
the five- day conference to develop global anti-corruption
strategies.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Minister Optimistic Over Congo Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
Process
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan State Minister for
Regional Cooperation Amama Mbabazi has said that he is optimistic
over the peace process in the war-torn Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks here Monday at the opening of the first
formal session of the Joint Military Commission (JMC), a body
which is charged with the responsibility of implementing the
Lusaka cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The difficulties which remain in the way are relatively
insignificant compared to those that we have already overcome.
Nobody, therefore, should be discouraged," he said in a keynote
speech at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The self restraint which has so far been exercised by most of
the signatories to the agreement, he added, is the greatest
source of encouragement and can be interpreted as clear evidence
that all the parties remain committed to the Lusaka agreement
they signed.
</P>
<P>
"This is a welcome assurance to those who have put their faith
in the agreement, and silences the skeptics who thought the
cease-fire was fragile and could not hold," the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Mbabazi, who is also the chairman of the political commission,
urged the JMC to immediately commence its peace-keeping role in
the DRC as clearly spelt out in the Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will lay the foundation for the work which you
will be doing over the next few months , and this will in turn
have great and crucial bearings on the peace and security of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
 While reiterating Uganda's commitment to the peace process in
the DRC, the minister appealed for the United Nations to give
more attention to Africa in order to pull Africa out of the acute
economic and political marginalization by the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
Six African countries directly involved in the year-old DRC
war signed the Lusaka peace agreement on July 10. The rebel
groups, the Rally for Democracy in Congo and Congo's Liberation
Movement, inked the document on August 1 and August 31
respectively.

<HEADLINE> African Anti-AIDS Meeting Held in Namibia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Government delegates,
employers and trade union representatives met in the Namibian
capital of Windhoek on Monday to discuss how to curb the spread of
the AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The first AIDS workshop of its kind was set up by the
International Labour Organization (ILO) and the United Nations
AIDS Program on the basis of increasingly alarming statistics, the
South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"It is time for us to create a coherent strategy for
intervention on social and labor issues related to this disease,
in a coordinated fashion with our partners," the ILO's Deputy
Regional Director for Africa, Ahmar Toure, declared.
</P>
<P>
Most people with AIDS or HIV are aged between 20 and 49, and
thus in what international bodies consider to be their most
productive years, whether they work in factories, offices or on
the land.
</P>
<P>
A World Bank study shows that the AIDS disease and its
precursor, the HIV virus, is the main single factor behind a
slowdown in economic growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
Of 33 million people estimated to have HIV worldwide. AIDS is
taking an increasing toll in southern Africa, while previous
conferences have heard how nations such as Uganda have begun to
check it by major health and public information measures.
</P>
<P>
Hitherto, symposiums assessed the social impact of AIDS and
medical factors, but ILO information officer Thomas Netter said
these approaches were insufficient and that a "multi-sector"
strategy was to be discussed.
</P>
<P>
About 100 delegates, including officials from 20 Sub-Saharan
countries, attended the start of the three-day conference, with
speeches from ILO Executive Director Mary Chinery-Hesse, UNAIDS
Executive Director As Sy and Namibian Health Minister Libertine
Amathila.

Packers Limited (TATEPA), the company's managing director George
Theobald announced here Monday.
</P>
<P>
TATEPA is the third company to be listed, and the very first
rivate company to offer shares to the public.

Purchase of the shares, at a price of 330 shillings (about 0.7
U.S. dollars) each will be closed on October 29. Tanzanian
citizens or investors can purchase the shares through agents,
brokers or nominated banks.
</P>
<P>
Another five percent is immediately being taken by the

<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair Monday brought Peter Mandelson back into government as
Northern Ireland Secretary in a wide-ranging cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson resigned last December amid controversy over his
financial affairs after a newspaper reported he failed to declare
a 373,000 pounds (617,000 U.S. dollars) home loan from fellow
minister Geoffrey Robinson, who also quit over the scandal.
</P>
<P>
In a major reshuffle among the cabinet, Mandelson, the former
Trade and Industry Secretary, replaced Mo Mowlam who now becomes
Minister for the Cabinet Office.
</P>
<P>
Jack Cunningham resigned from the post of Cabinet Office
Minister as the government's "policy enforcer."
</P>
<P>
With George Robertson leaving to become the new NATO
Secretary-General, his place as Defence Secretary was taken by
Junior Foreign Office Minister Geoff Hoon.
</P>
<P>
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Alan Milburn was appointed to
Health Secretary after the resignation of Frank Dobson, who is
standing for Mayor of London.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Civil Servants Threaten To Join </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The Public Services Association
(PSA) of Zimbabwe on Monday threatened that more civil servants
will join the strike of the doctors if the government fails to
solve the crisis facing the health sector immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to be dragged into a strike in support of our
dear brothers and sisters but if the situation remains unattended
we might have no choice but to act in solidarity with the
doctors," PSA executive secretary Charles Chiviru said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Chiviru proposed that the government declare a national
disaster for all lives lost during the strike and appoint a
committee to resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
The doctors have been on strike since September 21 for better
salaries and working conditions. The strike has paralyzed the
country's government hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Chiviru said the stand-off between the government and doctors
was due to the absence of labor laws in the public service.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise we are worried by the manner the state is valuing
patience against its lack of good labor relations policy," said
Chiviru.
</P>
<P>
The situation at the country's hospitals was getting worse as
each day passed, and there was a possibility of nurses joining in
the strike, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.

<P>
LUANDA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Foreign Minister Joao
Miranda met here on Monday with general Kofi Obeng, commander of a
United Nations squad in Angola, but no details were revealed.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Obeng, head of a UN squad consisting of dozens of
soldiers, has been in Angola for making a liquidation of the
former United Nations Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA), since
the withdrawal of the UN peacekeepers from Angola.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts expected that the return of U.N. presence in
Angola was discussed at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Angola, regarding U.N. as a shield for the National Union for
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) rebel movement, refused in
early 1999 to prolong the mandate of the UN mission, ending the
more than 10 year presence of the U.N. forces.
</P>
<P>
With the deterioration of the humanitarian and military
situation in Angola, the government in early August showed
positive gesture on the issue of the U.N. presence, permitting the
U.N. humanitarian relief operations in Angola.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A three-day symposium on "
States, Markets and Social Progress," co-sponsored by the United
Nations and the Chinese Government, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Participants will discuss three topics: Ensuring the welfare of
vulnerable groups and individuals, creating more jobs by promoting
small enterprises in all sectors, and financing social development.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the World Summit for Social Development was held in
Copenhagen, Denmark. Following that, the UN General Assembly
resolved to call a special session of the General Assembly on
Social Development in 2000 to make an overall review of the summit
and to issue further initiatives.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing symposium plans to prepare for this upcoming
appraisal, according to organizers.
</P>
<P>
In her opening speech to symposium guests, Hao Jianxiu, vice-
minister of the State Development Planning Commission, said the
Chinese government must maintain sustainable economic development
in order to create the necessary foundation for social growth.
</P>
<P>
Following the World Summit, China formulated its Ninth Five-
year Plan for the national economy and social development. The
plan contained two major points, she said: to maintain the
sustainable, rapid and sound economic development; and to promote
the mechanism for economic growth.

The plan aims to carry out the sustainable development strategy
and the policy of developing China on the basis of science and
education, while at the same time promoting material as well as
ethical and cultural progress.
</P>
<P>
The central government also put forward objectives for gross
domestic product (GDP), people's living standards, and the public'
s scientific and educational levels, in an effort to enhance the
sound development of justice, security, and civilization while
keeping social stability, the official said.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, China has witnessed great successes
in economic and social development. Living standards have been
obviously improved, and the number of impoverished people has been
reduced from 80 million in 1994 to about 40 million now.
</P>
<P>
The state policy focusing on poor areas has shown positive
results, with social undertakings in these areas having been
greatly developed, including free education, the sanitation of
basic units, radio broadcasting, and television.
</P>
<P>
In spite of China's huge labor force and the increasing number
of laid-off workers, the rate of unemployment in both urban and
rural areas remains at a low level, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The educational standards of the entire nation have been
promoted, the framework of a social security system put in place,
and public health conditions and social development facilities in
rural areas improved, she said.

Attending the Symposium are some 40 experts from 21 countries
and regions and representatives from related UN organizations.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Newspaper Director Summoned to Court for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The managing director of a
conservative Iranian newspaper was summoned to a military court
Monday for revealing secrets and publishing false political
reports, the official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Abbas Salimi Namin, managing director of the English daily
Tehran Times, was brought to court for revealing secrets and
publishing some false reports on a series of political murders in
the country, the report said, carrying a statement issued by the
judicial organization of the Iranian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The report did not, however, give more details on the charges
against Namin, whose daily is believed to be close to the
country's powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
Several Iranian political dissidents and writers were
mysteriously murdered in Tehran last year. Investigations
indicated that some staff members of the country's intelligence
ministry, including former deputy minister Saeed Emami, were
behind the killings.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Times reported Sunday that Emami's secretary and two
others had been arrested recently in connection with the serial
political killings.
</P>
<P>
Emami, who was believed to be the mastermind behind the
political killings, committed suicide in prison in June.
</P>
<P>
The statement issued by the armed forces also said that an
additional complaint against Namin will be dealt with by a press
court.

<HEADLINE> Dhanapala Says U.N. Must Play Central Role in  Disarmament Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 11 (Xinhua)-- Jayantha Dhanapala, U.N.
under-secretary-general for disarmament affairs, said Monday
that the United Nations must play a central role in promoting the
international disarmament, the nuclear disarmament in particular.
</P>
<P>
Dhanapala made the statement at the opening of the general
debate at the First Committee of the 54th General Assembly, which
is scheduled to end on October 20. The First Committee is in
charge of disarmament and international security affairs.
</P>
<P>
"The Committee will be taking up some timely and very complex
issues on the international security agenda," he said. "This
challenge has been rendered all the more formidable by a number of
developments over the last year that have jeopardized existing
disarmament agreements, while at the same time, military
expenditures are once again on the rise in many countries."
</P>
<P>
"Together, we must refuse to accept the war, weapons of mass
destruction, of the excessive accumulation or illicit transfer of
arms are now just hallmarks of the natural human condition," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We must reaffirm our collective commitments to the principle
of the (U.N.) Charter, including the peaceful settlement of
disputes and the duty to protect non-combatants in wartime
environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recently said in his "Report
on the Work of the Organization" that "there is no higher goal, no
deeper commitment and no greater ambition than preventing armed
conflict."
</P>
<P>
"Disarmament is central to that task and to the creation of a
culture of prevention," Dhanapala said.
</P>
<P>
Tomorrow, or Tuesday, will mark the official date when the
world population is expected to pass the 6-billion mark.
</P>
<P>
"The vision of the world community passing into a new century
with both growing populations and growing inequities in
opportunities and incomes, constitutes a potential nightmare for
international peace and security, all the more so in a
thermonuclear age," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This only further underscores that disarmament and development
are mutually-reinforcing and vital to world peace and prosperity,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
On nuclear disarmament, he said, "Though nuclear weapons
stockpiles have declined significantly since the days of the Cold
War, tens of thousands of such weapons remain in existence -- many
on high-alert status, many ready for first-use in future
conflicts, and many available for tactical battlefield use."
</P>
<P>
"With respect to strategic nuclear weapons, the START II treaty
has still not entered into force and,, while preliminary
discussions have begun -- negotiations have not yet started on
START III," he said, referring to the negotiations on the
reduction of strategic arms between the United States and Russia,
the world's two top nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also stressed the need to promote disarmament in
small arms and anti-personnel mines.

<HEADLINE> EU, Euro Zone Register 0.5% GDP Growth In 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Both euro zone and European
Union (EU) as a whole registered 0.5 percent growth of the gross
domestic product (GDP) in real terms during the second quarter of
1999, EU statistical office (Eurostat) said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It said the accelerated economic growth is mainly due to a
strong resumption in exports. In the first quarter of 1999, the
economy grew 0.4 percent in the 11-country euro zone (euro11) and
15-member EU (EU15).
</P>
<P>
The EU15 and euro11 domestic demand recorded a slow-down in the
second quarter, because of slackening in household's final
consumption expenditure, together with a strong down-turn in
investment, the Eurostat said.
</P>
<P>
It said, compared with Europe, the U.S. and Japanese economic
growth rates both slowed down in the second quarter to 0.4 percent
and 0.2 percent respectively as against 1.1 percent and 2.0
percent in the first one. The economic growth of the Group of
Seven industrialized nations in the second quarter also fell to 0.
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
It said GDP in both euro11 and EU15 grew by 1.6 percent from
the second quarter of 1998, while the U.S. and Japanese ones grew
by 3.9 percent and 1.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
It also said GDP of the euro11 and EU15 in the first two
quarters rose by 1.6 percent compared to the same period a year
before. The U.S. and Japanese figures rose by 3.9 percent and 0.6
percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Spain Shows "Inequivocal" Support for Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Spanish Ambassador in Angola
expressed here on Monday his country's "inequivocal" support for
the Angolan government and accused the rebels of interrupting the
peace process in the southwest African country.
</P>
<P>
Alvaro Iranzo, who mentioned that his country has always been
present in all phases of the peace process in Angola, was quoted
by official news agency Angop as saying that Spain aligns with the
position of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the European Union also regards the
attitude of the rebel leader of National Union for the Total
Independent of Angola (UNITA) Jonas Savimbi as frontally contrary
to the Lusaka Protocol and the resolutions of the U.N. Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
Iranzo said that "actually, Spain inequivocally supports the
legitimate government of Angola, and considers the bellicose group
led by Savimbi as responsible for the interruption of the peace
process," said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
"Spain appeals to all countries for a rigorous application of
the international regime of sanctions," advocated the Spanish
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Angola fell into civil conflict soon after it gained
independence from former colonist Portugal in 1975. Despite a
series of agreements including the Lusaka Protocol signed in
November, 1994, the country has been seeing rampant battles
between the government troops and the UNITA rebels.
</P>
<P>
Iranzo, in his speech, also stressed the "excellent" bilateral
relations between the two countries and the successful cooperation
in fishery.

<HEADLINE> EU to Probe into Plutonium Shipment Incident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- European Commission said here
Monday that its new president Romano Prodi had acted immediately
to give full and complete information to the public following an
plutonium shipment incident and ordered an investigation for it.
</P>
<P>
The concerned 0.91 gram radioactive material, which was under
control of Euratom, the European Union (EU)'s atomic energy body,
"loaded in a secure container" for delivery to the La Hague
nuclear facility in France but "was erroneously sent to Abingdon,
England, where maintenance of the special secure containers used to
transport nuclear material takes place at a secure facility
operated by the Croft company", the EU executive explained in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
The plutonium was in the form of a reference material prepared
at the Joint Research Center of the European Commission in Geel,
Belgium. This material is used to calibrate measuring equipment
needed in the Commission's work of keeping track of nuclear
materials in plants such as that in La Hague.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, in full cooperation with the commissioners concerned,
has ordered "a thorough review to establish precisely what
happened and to ensure that a similar incident cannot recur". This
review will include "a full re-examination of the procedures
followed at Geel involving external experts", the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The EU executive pointed out at least two major mistakes in
this incident. The container and its contents had been readied for
transportation to La Hague where the plutonium was needed.
However, "due to delays in obtaining export authorities from the
Belgian authorities the container was still in Geel until the
Euratom Safeguard Office in Luxemborg fetched".
</P>
<P>
According to the Commission's information, the whole delay
lasted more than one month. "Due to human error the plutonium was
not removed from the container before it left the facility in
Belgium." So, it was sent from Luxemborg to Abingdon by road last
Monday and the incident was exposed last Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak appealed here Monday for an international campaign to fight
terrorism which threatens the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
As the Middle East peace process moves on, certain terrorist
elements might try to conduct anti-peace activities or attack
Jewish people both in Israel and abroad, Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with visiting Italian
President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi after their meeting, Barak said it
is necessary for democratic countries all over the world to join
hands to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Talking about his government's policy on Jewish settlements,
he said that any settlement in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
should be built in accordance the law of Israel and be
approved by the government.
</P>
<P>
"The encampments in the settlements built illegally should be
dismantled," he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's ministerial committee on settlements met here on
Sunday to discuss encampments in the settlements and found at
least seven of the 42 encampments were illegally built.
</P>
<P>
The committee empowered Barak to decide whether those
outposts should be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
Carlo said this is his first visit to the region and
the visit is aimed at finding possible ways that Italy could
help move the process forward.
</P>
<P>
Carlo arrived here Monday for a three-day state visit at
the invitation of his Israeli counterpart Ezer Weizman.
</P>
<P>
He will travel to the West Bank city of Ramallah on
Tuesday to hold talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Stresses Judicial Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 11 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator today
stressed that laws be made to promote supervision role of the
National People's Congress (NPC) and the local people's congresses
in a move to ensure judicial justice.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of NPC, said that
according to China's constitution and related laws, the people's
congress and its standing committee have not only the right to
make legislation, but also the right to supervise the government,
people's courts and procuratorates.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks today during a discussion in Chongqing
Municipality with representatives of the legislation, judiciary
and legal experts on the draft of an NPC regulation to prevent
illegal practices among judges and procurators.
</P>
<P>
He said that the public is strongly opposed to the malpractice
taking place in courts and procuratorial departments, and the
regulation to be formulated will help improve the judicial
supervision of the people's congress and promote justice in the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, local people's congresses and their standing
committees have attempted to improve justice in the judiciary by
better supervising practices of judges and procurators, which
proved helpful, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the malpractice and corruption in judicial
departments should be mainly addressed and solved through their
strengthened internal supervisory organs, however, the NPC
regulation to be made will help judicial departments to more
closely examine their own practices and uncover any wrongdoing by
making full use of their self-supervision mechanism.
</P>
<P>
On October 10, Li also listened to reports on the economic
development of Chongqing and the resettlement of evacuees from the
Three Gorges Dam areas.

<HEADLINE> Russian Special Envoy in UAE to Seek Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A special envoy of Russian
Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov Monday delivered a message to the
government of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), briefing it on the
latest developments in Russia's rebel republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The message, which was received by UAE Minister of State for
Foreign Affairs Sheikh Hamdan Bin Zayed al Nahyan, was meant to
explain Russian troops' offensive in Chechnya and seek the UAE's
understanding and support, informed sources here said. But they
did not give the name of the envoy.
</P>
<P>
Understanding and support from Islamic states are very
important for Russia in its fight against Muslim extremists in
Chechnya, said the sources, requesting to be anonymous.
</P>
<P>
Besides the UAE, Russia is to send envoys to other major
Islamic countries such as Iran, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, a
Russian Foreign Ministry source said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Russia sent forces into the rebel republic of Chechnya on
October 1, to create a security zone in the north to prevent
rebels from staging attacks on targets in neighboring areas.
</P>
<P>
Moscow accused Chechnya of harboring Muslim militants who are
responsible for the recent incursions into Dagestan and the
terrorist attacks in Russia.

<P>
Liaison Officer
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- All the parties involved in
the year- long civil war in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)
will eventually remove the obstacles they face and the peace
process in the DRC is set to move forward, a United Nations
liaison officer has said.
</P>
<P>
Mwesigwa Issac, who has been in Kinshasa, the Congolese
capital, for one and a half months, told Xinhua here Monday,"the
meeting of the Joint Military Commission is planning the
strategies to implement the cease-fire and peace will eventually
come back to the DRC."
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian captain, who was invited to the JMC meeting to
establish contacts with the other participants of the meeting,
said:"Our intention is to complement and support the work of the
JMC. To this end, we have a dedicated JMC Support Team who will
assist, advise and help in whatever way they can. They are, in
effect, the U.N.'s link into the JMC."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the peace process needs support from
regional and international communities, explaining that peace in
the DRC is beneficial to both the Great Lakes region, the whole
of Africa and even the world.
</P>
<P>
The two-day JMC meeting, which opened here Monday, is to set

agreement.

<HEADLINE> Annan to Pay First Visit to Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan is expected to pay his first visit to Kosovo, the
Yugoslav province, to review the United Nations operation in the
region and meet with international officials, U.N. officials said
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is on a Balkan tour, is scheduled to visit the
Serbian province Wednesday and Thursday, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the U.N. chief is also expected to meet with main
political groups in the area.
</P>
<P>
Before NATO's March 24 air strikes on Yugoslavia, Belgrade had
invited Annan to visit Kosovo and gather first-hand information on
what was going on in the province. However, Annan saw the visit
unnecessary at that time because he said that he could get the
necessary information with the help of his special rapporteur and
the U.N. High Commission for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
Before his flight to Sarajevo, Annan Monday concluded his visit
to Rome after talks with Italian Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema,
which focused on the need to protect the individual in the
emerging international order.
</P>
<P>
After his arrival at the Bosnian capital, Annan was briefed by
his special representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Jacques
Klein, on relevant issues.

<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in last week's
train crash in London has been scaled down to around 30, said
police on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Police said earlier that some 70 people were feared dead and
Queen Elizabeth toured the crash site on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Six days after two commuter trains slammed into each other and
burst into flames near London's Paddington mainline station,
police said they believed the search for bodies was nearly over.
</P>
<P>
Last week's initial findings on the crash said it was probably
caused by one of the trains going through a red light.
</P>
<P>
So far police have recovered 30 bodies and the projected death
toll has fallen steadily as more of the missing contact police to
say they are safe.

DAMASCUS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Al-Khatib has expressed his country's support for Syria's
"fair and honorable" position on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local Syrian weekly "Teshrin," issued
on Monday, Al-Khatib said peace is the only option for the peoples
in the region, despite the difficulty and complication of the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that the talks with Israel should restart from
the point they arrived at in 1996. Damascus said former Israeli
prime minister Yitzhak Rabin had at that time promised to return
the strategic Golan Heights, which Israel seized from Syria in the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
He voiced hope that the leaders of regional countries will
heed to the desires of their peoples for establishing fair and
comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Al-Khatib also expressed hope that the Syrians will be able to
restore their rights and territories. The restoration of the
occupied land is the criterion, basis and price of peace, he
underlined.

<HEADLINE> UNFPA Appoints Mary Banotti Goodwill Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Population Fund (UNFPA) on Monday appointed Nary Banotti, Member
of the European Parliament, its Goodwill Ambassador and Face to
Face Campaign Spokesperson for Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Banotti has been a member of the European Parliament for 15
years. She is one of the most respected politicians in Ireland. In
June this year, she topped the polls in Dublin in the European
parliament elections. She was also a strong candidate in the last
Irish presidential election in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Banotti will work closely with the Irish Family Planning
Association, the UNFPA's partner in Ireland for the Face to face
Campaign.
</P>
<P>
Face to Face is an international campaign to publicize the
plight of millions of women and youth denied basic human rights
taken for granted in developed countries, especially access to
reproductive health care and family planning services.
</P>
<P>
The goal of face to Face is to increase global awareness that
women's rights are human rights. It also aims to build support for
increased funding for services that will allow everyone everywhere
to exercise their reproductive rights.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 350 million women around the world do not have
access to family planning information and services. About
600,000 women die each year from pregnancy-related causes. One
billion people lack the basic means for a decent life -- clean
water, shelter, food and security.

<HEADLINE> Barak Survives No-confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 11 (Xinhua)-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak survived Monday evening his first parliamentary
no-confidence motion vote after several hours of heated debate.
</P>
<P>
The voting of the motion was 18 in favor and 50 against, with
13 abstentions.
</P>
<P>
The motion, submitted by the opposition Likud, argued that
since coming to office in July, Barak has been making too much
concessions to the Palestinians in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Silvan Shalom, Likud Knesset member, who drafted the motion,
first took the floor to attack Barak, saying Barak has given too
much to the Palestinians during his three months in office.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Barak for signing the Sharm El Sheikh Memorandum
in early September, under which Israel has to give 2 percent more
of the West Bank land to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Haim Ramon, speaking on behalf of Barak and the coalition
government, rejected the charges.
</P>
<P>
The Barak government has conducted the peace talks with the
Palestinians within the framework of the Wye River Memorandum
signed by the former government headed by Benjamin Netanyahu, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Barak government has not given too much to the
Palestinians and all agreements reached with the Palestinians were
based on their commitments made to the process, he said, adding
that even the United States has admitted that the Palestinians
have fufilled their parts of obligations.

<HEADLINE> Factory Gate Prices In Britain Rising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Producer prices in Britain are
showing signs of picking up, heightening the prospects of another
interest rate hike.
</P>
<P>
The price of goods leaving the factory gate in September was up
0.3 percent on the month compared to a 0.1 percent increase in
August, according to the Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The annual rate of increase was also up from 1.3 percent to 1.7
percent, the highest level for almost three years. The stronger
than expected figures increase concern that the Bank of England
will raise interest rates agains.
</P>
<P>
The jump in prices was driven by oil prices, which rose 7.2
percent in September. If the prices of oil and food are stripped
out, output prices rose 0.2 percent in the month.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, the retail price data will be released, providing
further clues as to what the Bank of England is likely to do next.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, October 11 (Xinhua) -- At least 23 persons
were murdered Monday by gunshots during two killings in Colombia,
said authorities.
</P>
<P>
In one of the killings, paramilitaries slayed 13 workers in
Heliconia municipality, Antioquia department, in the northeast of
the country and another five in La Jagua de Ibirico locality,
Cesar department, in the north.
</P>
<P>
In both events occurring at dawn, Colombia's United
Autodefenses (AUC) took the victims out of their dwellings and
killed them after accusing them of collaborating with guerrillas,
according to authorities.
</P>
<P>
In Helicona's massacre, the bodies were tied by the hands.
Later they were left at a roadside.
</P>
<P>
The killings took place before the rebel Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army attacked a
cattle farm in Mutata, 247 kilometers west of Colombia's second
largest city of Medellin.
</P>
<P>
Five peasants died during the fighting, said the national army.

WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States Monday
deported a Saudi suspect who was allegedly involved in the 1996
bombing of a U.S. military complex that killed 19 U.S. servicemen,
the U.S. Justice Department said.
</P>
<P>
Hani al-Sayegh, who faces charges in connection with the truck

the past two years, to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, the Justice
Department said.
</P>
<P>
Sayegh was deported to the United States from Canada in 1997
after he reached an agreement with U.S. prosecutors to cooperate
in the investigation of the truck bombing while admitting his
guilt to plotting an aborted anti-American attack in Saudi Arabia
in 1994 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
But Sayegh then reneged on the plea deal, refusing to cooperate
and claiming he knew nothing about the attack. Since then, the
United States has been seeking to deport him.

<HEADLINE> Insecticide Treated Nets Can Prevent Malaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye Monday called on people to use insecticide
treated nets to prevent mosquito from spreading malaria.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye made the appeal while opening the Second International
Conference on Insecticide Treated Nets in Tanzanian capital Dar es
Salaam.
</P>
<P>
He said in Tanzania, malaria is the leading cause of outpatient
services and the number one cause of child mortality. Statistics
indicated that 25- 42 percent of outpatient visits and 25 percent
of deaths reported in Tanzanian health facilities are due to the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Malaria is also a major impediment to social and economic
development throughout Africa, he said, adding that it is
estimated that by the year 2000 the annual direct economic cost of
malaria across Africa will exceed 3. 5 billion U.S. dollars, twice
 what it was in 1995.
</P>
<P>
He said many governments in Sub-Saharan Africa overstretched
their resources to provide prevention and treatment services on
malaria related illness. For example, outpatient treatment of
malaria accounts for up to 40 percent of Africa's public health
expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The recent emergence and spread of malaria resistant to
chloroquine, a drug that has saved millions of lives for over five
decades, further highlights the need to promote new strategies to
protect vulnerable populations from infection and put our emphasis
on preventative measures, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) is one of the key
components of prevention, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said based on field trials in Tanzania, Kenya and Ghana, it
has been established that when properly used ITNs could reduce
mortality by more than 30 percent, and hospitalization by more
than 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
"We learnt also that malaria could be prevented, and more than
500,000 lives could be saved each year (C if ITNs were widely
available to many households in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Tanzanian Prime Minister said that the fight
against malaria by destroying habitat of mosquitoes has to
continue, adding that people need to clean their surroundings by
cutting grass and shrubs around houses and destroying stationary
water ponds.
</P>
<P>
The conference, sponsored by the London-based Malaria
Consortium, has attracted more than 230 delegates from some 40
countries across the world. The first conference was held in
Washington in 1997.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers Fail To Show "Energy For Democracy" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
foreign ministers failed on Monday to show their so-called "energy
for democracy" project to the Serbian opposition leaders because
most of the 32 invited leaders boycotted the EU Council of
ministerial meeting in Luxemburg.
</P>
<P>
EU sources said last week that the opposition representatives
would need to return home after the planned meeting "with concrete
proposals from the European Union to hasten the downfall of
Slobodan Milosevic". Contrary to the EU anticipation, most of the
Serbians did not come from the Republic of Yugoslavia, which was
severely damaged by the NATO's 78-day bombings.
</P>
<P>
The Serbians refused to attend the meeting after EU demanded
the terms that the oppositions promise to send Milosevic and other
"war criminals" to the international tribunal in The Hague. Some
observers believe they don't want to tarnish Serbians' image by
selling their country fellows under the pressure from the west.
But they do need aid for heating in the incoming winter from
western European countries, some Serbian leaders said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission has presented a pilot project for
providing heating oil to Nis and Pirot, the two Serbian cities
under the control of oppositions. The EU has tried to offer
deliveries of oil products for domestic heating to the people of
the two cities close to the border with Bulgaria, despite the
current oil embargo imposed by NATO and EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The "energy for democracy" plan was designed for a humanitarian
aid of three million U.S. dollars plus contributions from EU
governments. But the United States was opposed to it for fear of
helping the Milosevic government.
</P>
<P>
The EU said in a recent report that if the "experiment" were to
prove successful, "it might be extended to other cities in
opposition hands". Some analysts held that the U.S. pressure may
lead to the EU's miscalculation on the situation.
</P>
<P>
EU has also set some conditions for the oppositions to try
their best to bring Yugoslavia into European "mainstream". The EU
terms are said to be launching of international-standard law and
human rights, and holding free and fair public voting under
international monitoring.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian oppositions show that they don't want to sign
clauses in final declaration of the meeting for such kind of deal,
but just want their people's need of energy for living in cold
winter, observers said.
</P>
<P>
During their Monday's meeting, the 15 EU foreign ministers also
disagree on the lifting of air ban against Yugoslavia despite
calls "from certain quarters for the ban on flights to be lifted".

<HEADLINE> Canadian Hockey League Sees Drop of National Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Canada's National Hockey League
(NHL) has seen a drop of its players to 56 percent from almost 97
percent three decades ago.
</P>
<P>
The NHL figures released Monday indicated that the country for
the first time has shared its ice with 28 percent of Europeans and
16 percent of the U.S. born.
</P>
<P>
Canadians made up nearly 97 of NHL's 12 teams in the 1967-68
season.
</P>
<P>
The trend is not yet at its bottom, according the NHL source,
which expects "the Europeans will keep going up."
</P>
<P>
In the June draft of junior-aged players, slightly more than a
third of the players chosen by NHL clubs were from Europe,
suggesting NHL rosters in the next few years will continue to have
more Europeans.
</P>
<P>
This year's number of Canadian players has already dropped five
percent from the 1998-99 season.
</P>
<P>
Of the 661 players on the opening-night rosters of the 38 NHL
teams, 372 were Canadians, as compared with last season's 399.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the percentage of non-Canadian players is
partly attributed to a rising influx of east Europeans since 1989.
NHL currently has 50 players from the Czech Republic, 47 from
Russia and 10 from Slovakia.

<HEADLINE> Peres Moots Bypassing U.S. on Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Among the options that Israel
should seriously consider to renew talks with Syria is bypassing
the United States as a go-between, Regional Cooperation Minister
Shimon Peres said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Jerusalem Post published Tuesday,
Peres also said the time has come to consider a "fresh, creative
approach," adding that contenders to replace the U.S. could well
be Egypt or Europe.
</P>
<P>
He said three options are open to Israel to relaunch talks with
Syria: trying a direct approach as previous attempts to negotiate
through proxy had failed; bypassing the U.S. and contacting
instead through European or Middle Eastern states, with Egypt
playing a leading role as it did in Israel's talks with the
Palestinians; waiting to hear what Syria wants.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian peace talks went deadlocked three years ago
after the former hard-line prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu came
to power.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic activities for reopening the talks are under
way, but no substantial progress has been made so far.
</P>
<P>
Peres said it is time to reopen the Israeli-Syrian talks, and
peace with Syria could automatically bring about peace with 20
more nations.
</P>
<P>
He said there has been some progress made in reorganizing the
Middle East-North Africa Economic Summit, which has not been held
for two years.
</P>
<P>
The supposedly annual event is likely to be hosted by Egypt
early next year at Sharm El Sheikh, he added.
</P>
<P>
The event was first held in Casablanca, Morocco in 1994,
followed in successive years by Amman, Cairo and Doha.

ATHENS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton will
visit Greece on November 13-15, a week earlier than the November
21-23 dates that had been announced.
</P>
<P>
Announcing this at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Clinton's visit to Athens had been
brought forward due to a U.S. desire to facilitate the
participation of first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the visit to

<P>
Clinton's visit to Greece is part of a larger visit to the area
on the occasion of the Organization for Security and Cooperation

</P>
<P>
Describing Clinton's visit as "very important" and "useful,"
Reppas said that talks between Clinton and Greek leaders would
focus on issues of economic and trade cooperation, the combating
of terrorism and organized crime, bilateral relations and other
matters.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian-American scientist
Ahmed H.Zewail won the Nobel Prize for chemistry Tuesday for
demonstrating that a rapid laser technique can observe the motion
of atoms in a molecule as they occur during a chemical reaction.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said Zewail was being
honored for a revolution in chemistry through "his pioneering
investigation of fundamental chemical reactions, using ultra-short
laser flashes, on the time scale on which the reactions actually
occur."
</P>
<P>
The academy said Zewail's work in the late 1980s led to the
birth of femtochemistry, the use of high-speed cameras to monitor
chemical reactions at a scale of femtoseconds, or 0.
000000000000001 second.
</P>
<P>
"We have reached the end of the road. No chemical reactions
take place faster than this," the academy said.
</P>
<P>
"We can now see the movements of individual atoms as we imagine
them. They are no longer invisible," the academy said.
</P>
<P>
Zewail, who holds both U.S. and Egyptian citizenship, has held
the Linus Pauling chair of chemical physics at the California
Institute of Technology since 1990.

<HEADLINE> China Retains Team Title at World Championships (Updated) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, China, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The title-defending
Chinese gymnasts proved too much to their challengers despite a
few occasional slip-ups.
</P>
<P>
Under the inspiration of a partisan crowd, China scored a
runaway victory to retain their fourth straight title with nearly
flawless execution in the men's team final of the 1999 world
championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men showed top form which helped win a hat-trick of
titles in last three championships, scoring a final total of 230.
395 points.
</P>
<P>
China's arch-rival Russia, which overcame the sluggishness to
finish second to China in the qualifier on Monday, kept on the
heels of the defending champions but they had to settle for second
with 228.145. Belarus came third in 227.631.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the evening, defending champions Romania had to
overcome a slipping start and rallied strongly to score 153.527
points to retain their women's team title, holding off early
leader Russia to second in 153.209.
</P>
<P>
China finished third with 152.423.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men lived up to their reputation of the Dream Team
with their unmatched execution and solid landing which could not
win more ovation from the 8,000-capacity sell-out crowd.
</P>
<P>
Though Yang Wei flubbed in his landing from the vaulting horse
and Lu Yufu nearly missed the horizontal bars, all this counted
nothing to the hosts in their way to defending the title.
</P>
<P>
Huang Yubin, head coach of the men's team, showed his
satisfaction with his charges despite some complaint with the
start values in judging.
</P>
<P>
"We deserve the title, and the gymnasts have been true to their
form, but our priority is the 2000 Olympics medal,"said Huang. "We
don't think we can agree with the standard for judging the start
value of routines. But anyway we will overcome all this to win the
Olympics glory."
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jian, China's top gymnastics official, set his sight on
the Olympics as he lavished his praises on the men's team.
</P>
<P>
"They are very good, technically and mentally, and they are
where the Chinese gymnastics hope lies.
</P>
<P>
"But we will make greater efforts to win the Olympics
competition, for we have won four straight titles but we are yet
to win a team title in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"The reason we can keep strong is that we have depth and we
have paid great attention to bringing out hopefuls. With the 2000
Olympics in our sight, we have begun our preparation for the 2004
Games, and even the 2008 Games," Zhang said in an post-competition
interview.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese men entered the competition with a star-studded
line-up which was rated as "the best ever for China".
</P>
<P>
"They are less than 20 years old on average and this is a team
full of experience and drive. All of them are comeplete in
techniques and free from injury. They are the best ever Chinese
team for the world championships," said Chinese team leader Qian
Kui.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women gymnasts finished third with a line-up of
world championships first-timers and only veteran Liu Xuan in the
women's team competition.
</P>
<P>
In the dramatic women's team final, the Romanians took over the
lead in their last rotation on the uneven bars and edged the
Russians by 0.218 points.
</P>
<P>
"Uneven bars cost us the silver medal at the Olympic Games in
Atlanta, we finished on the third place. Tonight, Uneven bars
brought us the gold. There must be a destiny. we are too excited
to realize what has happened," said Octavian Belu, the legend
Romanian head coach.
</P>
<P>
Romanian women coach Bitang Maria also said: "We are very happy
because we won the title. However, we could not forget our
mistakes in the beam. Our gymnasts were too nervous."
</P>
<P>
The top favorite Romanian team stayed only in the fourth after
the first apparatus on the beam, scoring a lower-than-expected 37.
786 points.
</P>
<P>
But the Romanians led by world and Olympic champion Simona
Amanar soon calmed down. They piled up their lead in the rest of
the competition to capture their fourth title since 1994, 1995 and
1997.
</P>
<P>
The Russians wasted their title chance when the 1997 all-around
champion Svetlana Khorkina fell off the beam on their last
rotation for a poor 9.075 points.
</P>
<P>
After one day off on Wednesday, the individual all-round final
will begin on Thursday.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung said Tuesday he would be pleased if Tokyo normalized its
ties with Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
In an interview Tuesday with visiting Japanese Kyodo News
Service Director Ichiro Saita, Kim also expressed the hope that
the United States and the European Union would improve their
relations with Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Kim reiterated the fact that South Korea is prepared to improve
its relationship with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (
DPRK) and will help it develop agriculture and infrastructure if
the DPRK comes to the table of inter-Korean political meetings.
</P>
<P>
Kim also said he would extend a welcome to DPRK Asia-Pacific
Peace Committee Chairman Kim Yong-sun if he comes to Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Kim Yong-sun is expected to visit South Korea in December this
year at the invitation of the Hyundai Group, when another
basketball match between the DPRK and Hyundai teams is held.
</P>
<P>
During Hyundai founder Chung Ju-yung's five-day visit in
Pyongyang last month, Hyundai and the DPRK committee agreed to
expand the ongoing Kumgang Mountain tour program by attracting
foreign tourists to the area. The committee granted Hyundai
exclusive rights to establish an industrial complex on the DPRK's
western coast.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Minister Yohei Kono last Wednesday said Japan
would consider lifting the sanction on charter flights against
Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Kono's remarks are believed to indicate that Tokyo will seek to
normalize its stalled ties with Pyongyang, since recent Washington-
Pyongyang talks on missiles made some progress.

<HEADLINE> China's Machine Tool Industry Picks up Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China's machine tool industry
has regained growth after five consecutive years of losses, with
the sector's total output value in the first eight months of this
year topping 9.8 billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars), up 11.3
percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Yu Chengting, president of the China Machine Tool and Tool
Builders' Association, attributed the pick-up to the nation's
ongoing efforts to expand domestic demand and to support growth of
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
He said that nearly all machine tool manufacturers are doing
their utmost to adjust their industrial structures, develop new
products, and seek breakthrough developments in key technologies.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's total export volume of machine
tools from January to August this year rose by 14.5 percent year-
on-year over 1998.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the export value of digitally-controlled
metalworking tools rose by 26.7 percent, while the import volume
of machine tools dropped by 16.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Yu said that the domestic machine tool manufacturers had 53
percent of the total shares on the domestic market by the end of
last year, even though their total market shares had dropped
sharply to 36 percent because of tough competition from overseas
competitors.

<HEADLINE> India Says Data Confirms Measure Yields Of Nuclear Tests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW DELHI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Indian government officials
here asserted Tuesday that scientific data confirmed measured
yields of all five nuclear tests conducted in May, 1998, and more
data on the sub-kiloton tests would be "reported shortly".
</P>
<P>
High-ranking officials at the Department of Atomic Energy
(DAE) claimed that India had been "unique in promptly announcing
yields of all the five tests on the 11th and 13th of May, 1998,
and backing it up with scientific data.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the New York Times of the United States quoted an
upcoming book "The Indian Nuclear Test" as saying that Indian
nuclear test claims were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the report, DAE officials said their data
confirmed that the measured yields closely match the design values
for all the five devices waves.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times said that emerging consensus among nuclear
experts was that "what failed on May 13 was not the global
monitoring systems but the pair of explosive devices".

<HEADLINE> China Quickens Reform on Old-age Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China's system for old-age
pensions and insurance for retirees is in the midst of its most
vigorous reforms to date, said a senior official with the Ministry
of Labor and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of the State-owned enterprises (SOEs) reform
and the growth of the aging population, the system has become an
issue of great concern to both the government and ordinary people,
the official said.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that some 85 million workers in China
have entered the basic old-age pension social pools, accounting
for 81 percent of the total; while more than 27 million retired
workers, or some 98.5 percent of the total, have become
beneficiaries of the retirement pension social pools.
</P>
<P>
China's old-age pension and insurance for retirees system began
in 1951. At that time, only those enterprises with more than 100
workers could be covered by the system.
</P>
<P>
By 1978 when China kicked off its reform and opening-up drive,
some 3.14 million Chinese workers became eligible for the benefits.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, a decision to reform the workers'
old-age pension and insurance system, issued by the State Council
in 1991, set social pools as the direction of changes.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday morning met in a closed-door session to
consider a recommendation by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
send a 6,000-strong U.N. peacekeepers into Sierra Leone to promote
the peace process in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, originally scheduled for Monday, gave way to the
issue of Kosovo, the Yugoslav province, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
A British draft resolution calls for sending the U.N. troops
for an initial 12-month period to stabilizing the country after
years of civil war, U.N. officials said here.
</P>
<P>
In August, U.N. observers, journalists and civilians were taken
hostage and later released in Sierra Leone by rebels after the
United Nations said it would triple the number of observers in the
country to monitor a July 7 peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Annan, in his latest report to the Security Council, said that
Sierra Leone, which emerged from a brutal eight-year civil war
with the peace accord, desperately needs international assistance
to prevent another descent into violence and he asked the Security
Council to authorize the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
"Sierra Leone is in urgent need of security," he said in the
15-page report. "Without security, it will not be possible to
carry out the program of disarming and demobilizing approximately
45,000 ex-combatants, many of them children."
</P>
<P>
So far only about 670 rebels have reported to a demobilizing
camp near the capital of Freetown. Annan said U.N. humanitarian
agencies are expected to need at least three times the 22 million
U.S. dollars they have already asked donors for. About half the
210 U.N. military observers promised have been deployed.
</P>
<P>
Annan said his proposal of 6,000 U.N. troops depends on at
least part of the 12,000-member West African peacekeepers, known
as ECOMOG, "remaining in Sierra Leone" and other troops being
deployed to the U.N. If ECOMOG pulls out, a U.N. force of about
10,000 will be required, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Annan's proposal was well received by the Sierra Leonean
Government, headed by President Ahamed Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people were killed and many more injured
in the civil war, which left Sierra Leone in ruins. More than a
million people have been left homeless and 500,000 fled into
exile.

<HEADLINE> UN Population Clock Turns to 6 Billion People </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A population clock in
the visitor's lobby at the United Nations Headquarters in New York
on Tuesday turned to 6 billion people in the world.
</P>
<P>
In Bosnia, visiting U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan marked
the six billion milestone by honoring a boy born two minutes past
midnight as the world's symbolic six billion person.
</P>
<P>
The world's population has doubled since 1960, partly due to
some very positive developments, including increased life
expectancy and lower infant mortality, according to U.N.
demographers.
</P>
<P>
The demographers said the world population has increased by 1
billion in the past 12 years, and the rate is expected to slow
somewhat by 2050 to perhaps 8.9 billion people, according to U.N.
demographers.
</P>
<P>
The plan of action adopted at a 1994 U.N. population conference
in Cairo, Egypt, estimates the price of stabilizing world
population at 17 billion U.S. dollars per year.
</P>
<P>
U.N. demographers still foresee an annual increase of 78
million a year, and the fast-growing regions are sub-Sahara
Africa, where the average woman has 5.5 children as well as parts
of South Asia.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Chinese Company to Jointly Build Dry-Dock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar transport
authorities and a Chinese company reached a contract here Tuesday
evening on building a 12,000-DWT (dead weight tons) dry-dock at
the state-run Myanma Shipyards (MS).
</P>
<P>
The contract was signed between the MS of the Ministry of
Transport and the Shandong Agricultural Industry and Commerce
Group Corporation of China.
</P>
<P>
Second Secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council Lieutenant-General Tin Oo and Deputy Prime Minister
Lieutenant-General Tin Tun attended the contract signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The dry-dock to be built has a length of 168 meters, a width of
28 meters and a depth of 9 meters, and will be completed within
two years, according to the contract.
</P>
<P>
The investment amount for the project is estimated to reach one
billion Kyats (about 167 million U.S. dollars), involving
25.45-million-dollar seller's credit.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the dry-dock will not only be able to repair
Myanmar's domestic ocean-going vessels but also foreign ones, said
Myanmar Minister of Transport Major-General Hla Myint Swe at the
contract signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He added that it will not only save foreign exchange for
Myanmar but will also earn such income for the country.
</P>
<P>
He also said China is a country which offers the greatest
assistance to Myanmar for its economic development, adding that
China has many economic, social, industrial and technical
organizations which have cooperative relations with Myanmar
government departments and private enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The existing Myanmar dock has reportedly only a capacity of
1,000 DWT and an extension to at least 10,000 DWT of capacity is
in urgent need.

<HEADLINE> Gymnastics Official Explains Start Value Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, China, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese gymnasts failed
to earn high scores at the women's qualifiers not because their
performance is poor but the judging criterion for the start value
(SV) is not in uniform, an organizing official said here on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The problem lies with the discrepancy in judging the SV for
routines," said Miao Zhongyi, men's technical director for the
world championships which opened here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
In the women's qualifier which ended on Monday, three Chinese
female gymnasts including veteran Liu Xuan won the heart of the
crowd but failed to impress the judges who were at odds with the
Chinese coaches in SV for routines.
</P>
<P>
What surprised Chinese coaches most was that the routines of
world champion Liu Xuan whose SV on the beam was put at 9.7 points
instead of the 10 points the Chinese had set. Liu's final score
was 9.45.
</P>
<P>
It happened again to the Chinese in the later men's qualifier
which saw Xing Aowei finish 9.55 in the horizontal bar after the
judges set the SV of his routines at 9.80 points instead of the
maximum points.
</P>
<P>
"Such cases have happened in the previous championships. At
this championships, China was not the only one who lodged their
complaint. Five or six more teams also expressed disagreement."
said Miao.
</P>
<P>
Miao tried to unwrap the puzzle although he also felt very
puzzled.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for the discrepancy is that the scoring rules are
very complex, and not easy as those of basketball or soccer. The
rules for the beam stipulate that if the routines have
insufficient execution or bad connection, bonus points may not be
awarded, thus lowering the start value. "
</P>
<P>
"As for Xing Aowei, one of his elements was not included in the
rules book of the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG). Xing
has executed the element in the Asian Games and the first leg of
the world Cup series in June and the element was classified into
Group E.
</P>
<P>
"This time the head judge and his assistants for men's high bar
put it in Group D, so that his bonus points for difficulty and
connection was less." said the official.
</P>
<P>
Miao said he had consulted with Hardy Fink, the president of
the FIG men's technical committee, but it got nowhere.
</P>
<P>
"Their judging is final and I have to respect them. I have no
right to change it," Fink was quoted as saying by Miao.
</P>
<P>
"Fink said different competition of the championships will have
different judges, so such disputes will continue," said Miao. "
But it will be limited to only a small portion."

MACAO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Macao will host the 46th motor
grand prix on October 20 and 21, sources with the races'
organizing committee said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Macao's motor racing was started in 1954 and attracts hosts of

is narrow, curvy and undulant, makes the races rather breathtaking.

<HEADLINE> Former Japanese Official Gets Suspended Sentence for Debt Rigging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Masuo Morodomi, a former senior
official of Japan's Defense Agency, received a three-year
suspended prison sentence Tuesday for illegally lowering the
amount of refunds domestic defense contractors owed his agency.
</P>
<P>
According to the court ruling, in 1994 and 1995, as head of the
Defense Agency's Central Procurement Office, Morodomi secretly
slashed the amount of refunds that should have been paid to the
agency by Toyo Communication Equipment Co. and Nico Electronics Co.
The two companies had previously overcharged the government in
some defense contracts.
</P>
<P>
Morodomi, now 60, was charged with breach of trust and pleaded
guilty last March.
</P>
<P>
The court also gave suspended prison terms to 12 other
defendants from Toyo Communication, Nico and Japan's electronics
giant NEC, who were also involved in illegally reducing the amount
of refunds.
</P>
<P>
Toyo Communication is affiliated to NEC, while Nico is also an
NEC subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
Presiding Judge Toshikazu Obuchi said that Morodomi committed
the crime because he was afraid he would be held responsible for
the contractors' overcharging his agency.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the judge said, Morodomi also asked those involved
companies to offer positions to Defense Agency officials after
their retirement in exchange for the refund cut.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government lost about 3.54 billion yen (33 million
dollars) due to the refund cut, said the court ruling.

<HEADLINE> China's Family Planning Policy Pays Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Today is the day the world
population hit six billion -- a historic moment that would have
come four year earlier had China failed to bring its population
growth under control.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zili, director of China Population Information Networking
Committee, made the remarks today at the opening ceremony of a
function marking "World Day of Six Billion People" in Shenyang,
capital of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
He said that China, with the world's largest population, has
successfully slowed down the population growth rate over the past
few decades by practicing a family-planning policy that mandates a
couple may have only one child.
</P>
<P>
He said that China had a population of about 400 million at the
beginning of this century. Now, the official figure is 1.25
billion.
</P>
<P>
But China's population total would have been 634 million higher
if the country had not brought its ballooning figures under
control, Xiao said, adding that the family planning policy is
responsible for a 338 million reduction in population.
</P>
<P>
"China's family-planning policy has not only proved to be of
great importance to promoting social, economic and cultural
development in China, but also helped to maintain a balance of the
world population," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the United Nations, it took
12 years for the world population to rise from five billion in
1987 to the current six billion; the world population is expected
to hit some 8.9 billion by the year 2050.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said that China's family planning policy will have to be
in effect for a long time to come, and the Chinese Government has
adopted macro-control measures to maintain a lower birth rate.
</P>
<P>
A postcard printed with "World Day of Six Billion People" was
issued in Shenyang today to raise people's awareness of population
problems.
</P>
<P>
The China Population Information Networking Committee was
established nine years ago, including as members the China
Population Information Research Center and local population
information research centers in a dozen provinces, municipalities
and autonomous regions.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Army Chief Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif Tuesday forced Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Committee (JCSC) and Army Chief General Pervaiz Musharraf to
retire, official sources said.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf is the second JCSC and army chief who resigned before
completing his tenure since the government led by Nawaz Sharif
resumed power in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
The top military leader, who succeeded former JCSC chairman
Jahangir Karamat in October 1998, was due to complete his tenure
in October, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Gen. Zia Uddin, chief of Pakistan's Inter Services
Intelligence, has been appointed as the new army chief with
immediate effect. He has also been promoted to the rank of
general, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reason for the early retirement of
Musharraf, but in recent weeks there have been reports of a
yawning rift between the army and the civilian government caused
by the Kargil conflict this summer in the disputed area of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
There was also reports that Sharif was unhappy with Musharraf's
recent remarks on the country's economic performance and political
situation.
</P>
<P>
During a local function last week, the army chief described the
political situation in the country as "very poor" and said he was
also not satisfied with the economic performance of the
government.
</P>
<P>
One report suggested Sharif was not happy with Musharraf's
latest move to have forced corp commander Lt. General Tariq
Pervaiz to retire.
</P>
<P>
Pervaiz was reported to have met Prime Minister Sharif recently
and sought his appointment as the new army chief. However, Pervaiz
denied the meeting with Sharif, saying he will disclose in a few
days about his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Some observers also indicated that Sharif is dissatisfied with
Musharraf's "ambiguous" attitude towards opposition Parties's
calls for the army's interference in the country's political
affairs.
</P>
<P>
On September 29, Sharif extended Musharraf's tenure as the JCSC
chairman for another one and half year to October, 2001.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan Navy Chief Admiral Fasih Bukhari resigned on October
2, reportedly discontented at the decision to extend Musharraf's
tenure.

<HEADLINE> China Retains Team Title at Gymnastics Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The title-defending host China
proved too much to their challengers despite a few occasional slip-
ups.
</P>
<P>
Under the inspiration of a partisan crowd, China scored a
runaway victory to retain their fourth straight title with their
nearly flawless execution in the men's team final of the 34th
gymnastics world championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chinese men showed top form which helped earn a hat-trick of
titles in the last three championships with a final total of 230.
395 points.
</P>
<P>
Chinese arch-rival Russia, which overcame the sluggishness to
finish second to China in the qualifier on Monday, kept on the
heels of the defending champions but they had to settle down for
second with 228.145. Belarus came in third on 227.631.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese gymnasts lived up to their reputation of the Dream
Team with their unmatched execution and solid landing which could
not win more ovation from the 8,000-capacity sell-out home crowd.
</P>
<P>
Though Yang Wei flubbed in his landing from the vaulting horse
and Lu Yufu nearly missed the horizontal bar, all this counted
nothing to the hosts in their way to defending the title.
</P>
<P>
Chinese men entered the competition with a star-studded line-up
which was rated as "the best ever for China".
</P>
<P>
"They are less than 20 years old on average and this is a team
mixed with experience and drive. All of them are all-around in
techniques and free from injury. They are the best ever Chinese
team for the world championships," said Chinese team leader Qian
Kui earlier in the championships.
</P>
<P>
The happiness never comes alone as the Chinese women gymnasts
finished third with a line-up of world championships first-timers
and only veteran Liu Xuan in the earlier women's team competition.
</P>
<P>
Under the coaching of gymnastics legend Belu Octavian, the
title-holder Romania retained their fourth world title after they
were crowned in 1994, 1995 and 1997. Russia was the runner-up.
</P>
<P>
Romania scoring the winning total of 153.527 points, followed
by Russia in 153.209 and China 152.423.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> PNA Regrets Levy's Failure to Attend Donors Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A Senior Palestinian official on
Tuesday expressed disappointment at Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy's failed to attend the coming meeting of Palestinian donor
countries in Tokyo, capital of Japan.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Planning and International Cooperation in the
Palestinian National Authority Nabil Sha'ath said Japan, the host
country, was also disappointed.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was scheduled for Thursday and Friday in Tokyo and
Levy had planned to participate in the gathering, Sha'ath said
before departure for Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Ministry had announced the cancellation of
Levy's presence at the conference after several foreign ministers
said they would not attend in person. Levy is currently visiting a
number of European countries.
</P>
<P>
Sha'ath said the Palestinian side will seek to obtain the
remaining funds pledged by the donor countries, pointing out that
allocations for this current year amount to 750 million
U.S. dollars, of which 230 million have already been transferred.
</P>
<P>
The donors conference is expected to adopt decisions in support
of the Palestinian five-year plan projects - to fix the dates of
payment of the pledged arrears, to define the donors' financial
obligations to the PNA for the coming year, and to form a
mechanism to extend assistance funds for the implementation of the
proposed Palestinian projects.
</P>
<P>
Norway, in its capacity as the party addressing invitations,
will preside over the donor countries conference to be hosted by
Japan for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The previous donors conference held in Washington last year had
raised approximately 4 billion dollars as assistance to
Palestinian projects over a period of five years.

<HEADLINE> WIPO Official Praises China's IPR Protection (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI,October 12 (Xinhua) -- China has made tremendous
development in its intellectual property system, and the World
Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) is always appreciative
of China's efficient work at home and abroad, said a WIPO official.
</P>
<P>
Roberto Castelo, WIPO Deputy Director General, made the remark
today at the International Symposium on Fruit and Vegetable
Processing Technology and Industrialization, jointly sponsored by
the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP)
of the United Nations, the Asia Pacific Center for Transfer of
Technology, the Chinese Academy of Engineering, and the Provincial
People's Government of Shandong.
</P>
<P>
"Within less than 20 years, China has developed from scratch a
modern, well-functioning intellectual property system which is in
harmony with the international intellectual property laws and
practices," Castelo said.
</P>
<P>
China's patent offices received in 1998 over 130,000 patent
applications, with an average annual increasing rate of about 15
percent since April, 1985 when China has its Patent Law put into
effect.
</P>
<P>
"WIPO is always appreciative of the active and efficient work,
both at home and abroad, of the Chinese intellectual property
authorities," said the WIPO Deputy Director General. In the
framework of the program of cooperation for development, WIPO has
cooperated with China in a wide range of areas. They have co-
organized in China more than 50 international, regional and
national seminars and training courses in various fields of
intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 WIPO expert missions have visited China while
Chinese officials were invited to foreign countries for study
visits.

<P>
WIPO has awarded Chinese with some 50 WIPO Gold Medals in
recognition of the outstanding contribution of inventors since
1984.
</P>
<P>
Castelo believed that intellectual property right (IPR)
protection would be conducive to the sustainable growing of fruit
and vegetable processing and industrialization.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries have traditionally produced raw material
and their economy was more based on the production of such raw
material and commodities export. With increasing globalization of
markets in the last couple of decades, the plummeted prices of raw
material alerted these countries that to remain competitive, they
must attach more importance to processing and adding value to the
raw material.
</P>
<P>
"It is here that technical information on technologies that
provide for the possibility of adding value is crucial," he noted.
Adding value to such raw material by transforming them into new
and improved products will not only reduce the wastage of raw food
but create new jobs while increasing the offer of food to human
being.
</P>
<P>
"Technical information and WIPO's assistance in facilitating
the access to and the protection of such information should prove
extremely useful for small and medium enterprises as they search
for better and more sophisticated ways of processing and adding
value to such raw material," he added.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing symposium was the first of its kind ever held in
China. Participants were expected to discuss and share new
technology of fruit and vegetable processing, and promote
international cooperation in the field.

<HEADLINE> EU Sets Timetable For Beef Labeling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Tuesday that it will adopt two proposals setting the timeframe for
the compulsory labeling of beef in the 15-member European Union (
EU).
</P>
<P>
Under the EU's Amsterdam Treaty, the EU executive said, the
objective of the first proposed regulation is to set up a
transparent obligatory labeling system.
</P>
<P>
The first stage will enter into force one month after the
adoption of the regulation and aims to let the consumers know the
"information readily available at the point of slaughter," the
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
From January 1, 2003, the beef label has also to include
information on "where the animal was born and reared," the EU
executive arm said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
Given the time required for adoption of the first regulation,
the second proposal prolongs the existing Regulation (EC) No. 820/
1997 for voluntary labeling until January 1, 2001, at the latest,
the commission added.
</P>
<P>
The European Union is trying to implement a transparent health
protection mechanism for consumers after several food crises
occurred in European countries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Technology Expo Begins in Lahore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAHORE, Pakistan, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A three-day exhibition
of Chinese technologies began here Tuesday under the aegis of the
Commission on Science and Technology for Sustainable Development
in the South (COMSATS).
</P>
<P>
A number of leading Chinese enterprises are taking part in the
exhibition to introduce their machinery and equipment applicable
to sectors like agriculture, packaging and food processing,
organic fertilizers, chemicals, textiles, electro-medical and
solar energy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to
Pakistan Lu Shulin said, "the development of science and
technology is much faster in today's world than we can imagine."
</P>
<P>
Without science and technology, economic progress would be
found difficult to get started, he said. China has a large
population, 80 percent of which or close to 800 million are
farmers. Their labor, their poverty or wealth all have a direct
bearing on the development of the whole of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The development of rural economy is the ground on which China
can develop vigorously," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the COMSATS exhibition would help boost the
Sino-Pakistani ties in the field of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Federal Science and Technology Secretary Javed Masud said that
China's achievements in the field of science and technology are
spectacular as it is now even able to assist other developing
countries in this field.
</P>
<P>
He said that scientific development has helped increase the
agricultural productivity in China.
</P>
<P>
The application of science and technology in agriculture could
bring socio-economic uplift in the countryside of Pakistan, Masud
said.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan should take advantage of the development made by its
friend China in the fields of science and technology," Masud said.

<HEADLINE> First U.N. Staff Member Killed in Pristina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations staff member
was shot dead in Pristina Monday evening, an international police
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The victim, who was believed to be a Bulgarian and had just
arrived in Pristina, was the first U.N. staffer killed since the
international peace-keeping forces entered Kosovo, Tanjug news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian language, which sounds somewhat similar to
Serbian, might have been responsible for causing his death, said
international police news center official Lt. Col. Dmitry Kapotsev.
It is believed the victim may have been mistaken for a Serb while
speaking Bulgarian on the street, and was killed by ethnic
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
Since the international peace-keeping force entered Kosovo four
months ago, over 400 non-Albanians have been killed and 250,000
Serbs have been driven from their homes.
</P>
<P>
Even Polish members in the international police force dare not
speak Polish in Kosovo's streets now because it sounds too much
like Serbian.

<HEADLINE> Expert Calls for More Use of Electric Bicycles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua)-- China should give priority to
production and use of electric vehicles for public traffic, mail
service and tourism because of its relatively poor road conditions,
Zhou Heliang, chief engineer of State Administration of Machinery
Industry, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhou also disclosed that the Chinese Government is working on
regulations to restrict the use of fuel-powered motorcycles and
will encourage people to buy electric bicycles.
</P>
<P>
"With the new laws in place, the production of electric
bicycles will be largely expanded and become a new hot spot of
China's economic development," Zhou said at a press conference for
the 16th International Electric Vehicle Symposium and Exhibition,
which began here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, electric cars may be more and more popular as people
's living standard increases and urban traffic is improved, he
added.
</P>
<P>
He said that electric bicycles and motorcycles are more easily
accepted in China, given the present income level.
</P>
<P>
Electric bicycles will cost 2,000 to 3,000 yuan in China, which
is acceptable for common people, and the investment of electric
bicycle and motorcycle production is much less than electric cars,
Zhou added.
</P>
<P>
And electric bicycles will be the best substitute for fuel-
powered motorcycles, which now create serious air pollution in
large cities, he noted.
</P>
<P>
At the 16th International Electric Vehicle Symposium and
Exhibition, which will last for four days, the world's major
vehicle manufacturers were busy promoting their latest electric
vehicles here.
</P>
<P>
General Motors exhibited its newly-developed models such as the
electric pickup truck, "parallel hybrid electric EV" and "series
hybrid electric EV." Toyota displayed its hybrid vehicle "Prius"
and electric car "e-com."

newborns," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
He said growing popularity of the conference, which was being
held for the first time on the African continent, was an
encouraging sign of the momentum in the fight against corruption.

BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China announced today it will
auction off 15 of the floats used in its grand National Day parade,
with opening bids to start at 500,000 yuan (60,240 U.S. dollars)
each.
</P>
<P>
Authorities in charge of the floats said that buyers will be
preserving history with their purchase of the elaborate parade
floats, which traveled past Tiananmen Square in the heart of
Beijing on October 1, the 50th founding anniversary of the People'
s Republic.
</P>
<P>
Ninety floats -- some with high-tech features -- were created
for the celebration, made by craftsmen from various provinces,
municipalities and autonomous regions and from government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six of the floats have been on public display on the
Square since the parade, and the other 24 were dismantled in a
nearby factory.
</P>
<P>
During their nine-day stay in the world's-largest square, the
floats, representing unique scenery or characteristics of various
provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions and other areas,
became musts for visitors' snapshots.
</P>
<P>
Parade organizers previously decided to dismantle all the
floats before October 15, but reconsidered when some businessmen
offered to buy. Authorities then decided to sell 15 of them at
auction.
</P>
<P>
The floats not for auction are housed in a stadium for the time
being, waiting to be transported to their home provinces.

<HEADLINE> Manila Keeps Monitoring of Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
continues to keep a close watch of movements in the world prices
of crude oil, the presidential palace said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech that
Philippine President Joseph Estrada has not forgotten his promise
to talk with representatives of the oil firms, if the prices of
petroleum products become unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
"The president has mentioned this. The government continues to
monitor the prices of oil products. And if it feels the hike is
unreasonable, it will talk to representatives of the oil firms,"
Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Zamora's made the remarks amid some sectors's concern over the
government's seeming lack of action following the recent drop in
the world prices of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
They also raised fears that some oil firms appear insensitive
to this because of their alleged plans to raise fuel prices anew.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government still recognizes the direct and
indirect effects of another oil price hike on the economy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Department of Labor and Employment said oil prices
are among the factors being considered by regional wage boards in
deciding on petitions for wage adjustments.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that while oil prices have a smaller impact on the
Consumer Price Index (CPI) than rice, their indirect effect is
much more significant.
</P>
<P>
"We can say the direct effect of oil prices on the CPI is
small. But we must remember they are used as benchmarks for other
prices such as transportation and basic goods. That's why we are
keeping tabs on oil prices," Zamora added.

<P>
MANILA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' national flag
carrier, Philippine Airlines (PAL) has reported a combined net
income of 109 million pesos (2.72 million U.S. dollars) for July
and August as it continued to perform well after entering
rehabilitation earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The better-than-expected results sustained the momentum of
PAL's gains in the April-to-June period of 1999, the first quarter
of its current fiscal year, when it reported a net income of 65.4
million pesos (1.6 million dollars), the Philippine News Agency
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Revenues for July and August reached 4.4 billion pesos (110
million dollars), with passenger operations leading the way with
3.4 billion pesos (85 million dollars) or 78 percent of the total
earnings.
</P>
<P>
PAL carried nearly 804,000 passengers during the two months on
nearly 3,000 round-trip flights.
</P>
<P>
Cargo operations yielded 519 million pesos (12.9 million
dollars) or 12 percent of revenues, while other transport
activities contributed 358 million pesos (8.9 million dollars) and
non-transport businesses generated 102 million pesos (2.5 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
PAL is believed to be on track to post its second successive
quarterly profit at the end of September and to meet -- or even
better -- its annual financial targets set in the rehabilitation
plan.

<HEADLINE> Hang Seng Bank Announces Special Interim Dividend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Hang Seng Bank
Tuesday announced that a special interim dividend of 4.10 HK
dollars (0.53 U.S. dollars) per share, totaling 7,839 million HK
dollars (1,005 million U.S. dollars), is to be paid to
shareholders on November 5, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The dividend will be paid out of the distributable retained
profits of the bank, which amounted to 26,252 million HK dollars (
3,366 million U.S. dollars) on June 30, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a statement that the payout reflects active
consideration of its capital requirements under its managing for
value strategy, which seeks to maximize shareholder value through
the more efficient use of capital and resources.
</P>
<P>
Continued strengthening of the bank's capital base has led to a
level of capital which is in excess of current and planned future
business requirements.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Cheng, vice-chairman and chief executive of the bank,
said that the over the past decade, Hang Seng's capital base has
grown at an annual rate of over 10 percent through the
accumulation of retained profits and appreciation in asset values.
</P>
<P>
Its capital ratio of 22.7 percent on June 30 was considerably
higher than the industry average for local banks and one of the
highest among major international banks.
</P>
<P>
The adjusted capital ratio for June 30 after the payout will

<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China and Austria plan to
organize an evening arts gala to be held in front of the world
largest imperial palace, the Forbidden City in downtown Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Marking the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China, China Central Television (CCTV) and Austrian
National Television have planned the performance for the evening
of October 16 at the Wumen Gate Square, the south entrance of the
Forbidden City.
</P>
<P>
For the past 18 years, the Austrian Television has regularly
broadcast a traditional program featuring unique national arts and
cultures. The folk singing and dancing have always been a hit with
Austrians and other residents in its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement signed by the Chinese and Austrian
organizers, this year's gala will be carried out in Beijing.
During the show, nearly 300 foreign singers and dancers and more
than 500 Chinese performers will put on an elaborate two-hour show
for a live audience and TV viewers.
</P>
<P>
Many well-known Austrian orchestras and children's choruses are
expected to participate. Meanwhile, the Chinese will present many
traditional arts, performed by the China Radio Nationalities
Orchestra, the China Railway Art Ensemble, the Conservatory of
Chinese Music and other groups.
</P>
<P>
CCTV directors said that they believe the program will
especially underscore Chinese and Austrian traditional cultural
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
CCTV is going to broadcast the program worldwide via its
Channel One and Channel Four. Other television stations from
Germany and Switzerland will also broadcast the performance during
prime time viewing hours, according to CCTV sources.

accounting for 10 percent of the country's total.

<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Jia Lanpo, who unearthed three
fossilized skulls of Peking Man, and other world-renowned
anthropologists convened today in Beijing to commemorate the
discovery of the first Peking Man skull 70 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Pei Wenzhong, the late leading Chinese archeologist, dug out
the first broken skull of Peking Man, who lived some 500,000 years
ago, in 1929 near Zhoukoudian in the southwestern suburbs of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Sciences, the State Administration of
Cultural Heritage, and the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) jointly hosted the
commemoration.
</P>
<P>
Since the discovery of the fossilized skulls of Peking Man,
Zhoukoudian has been one of the world's major archeological and
paleoanthropological research centers.
</P>
<P>
Global academic circles still regard the site as one of the
most important cultural ruins for its abundance of relics.
</P>
<P>
In December 1987, UNESCO listed Zhoukoudian as a World Heritage
site. China has also established a committee for its protection.
</P>
<P>
After the commemoration conference, more than 70 well-known
archeologists and paleoanthropologists from Japan, France, the
United States and other countries are scheduled to take part in a
five-day international paleoanthropology seminar.

<HEADLINE> China to Persist in Birth Control Policy: Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China, the world's most
populous country, has pledged to persist in its birth control
policy as the population of the planet reached six billion today.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to enforce its effective family planning
policy in the new century in order to create a favorable
environment for further development," Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to a Beijing meeting marking the World Day of Six
Billion, Zhu said that without China's efforts, the world's
population would have passed six billion four years ago.
</P>
<P>
He added that more than 300 million births have been avoided
thanks to the fundamental state policy of the past three decades,
which has also benefited the country's economic growth and the
improvement of people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Despite this success, however, China remains vigilant on the
issue of population since an average of 10 million people are born
every year, which means even heavier pressures on natural
resources, the environment, employment and the social security
network.
</P>
<P>
Home to a fifth of the world's people now, China plans to keep
its population under 1.4 billion through 2010, and 1.6 billion by
2050, with the aging and working populations reaching a peak at
that time.
</P>
<P>
"Any laxity on our part will lead to a rebound of the birth
rate. Our task is therefore long-term and arduous," warned Zhang
Weiqing, director of the State Family Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to today's meeting at Beijing's Great Hall of the
People, Vice-Premier Li Lanqing urged the combining of family
planning programs with sustainable development strategies.
</P>
<P>
"While carrying out these programs, we should achieve the
integration of economic growth, poverty eradication, education,
environmental protection, and the improvement of women's social
status," Li said.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of family planning workers and volunteers
conducted publicity activities and services nationwide today,
focused on the theme "Population and Sustainable Development."
</P>
<P>
"We must be aware of our responsibility to future generations.
What we do now and in the near future will have a major impact on
life throughout the 21st century," said Kerstin Trone, deputy
executive director of the United Nations Population Fund, at today
's meeting.

<HEADLINE> Missile Detection Base Closed in South Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- An Australia-US missile
detection base in Nurrungar closed formally Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Joint facility near Woomera in South Australia played a key
role for 29 years in monitoring missile launches and guarding
against a nuclear first strike, AAP reported.
</P>
<P>
During the Gulf War, the base provided advance warning of Iraqi
Scud missile launches.
</P>
<P>
Improvements in satellite technology, which collects the
information sent to Nurrungar, mean the base is no longer needed.
</P>
<P>
Over the next six months, Nurrungar will be dismantled, leaving
no trace of the distinctive protective radar covers or any other
part of the base. By the time this has finished, the site will
have returned to desert and approximately two thirds of the
population of nearby Woomera will have gone, leaving a huge cloud
over the future of the town.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister John Moore witnessed today's
closing ceremony. He told reporters that the closure of Nurrungar
did not signal a rundown in the defense relationship between
Australia and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Government to Reform Health Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- An all-embracing plan of action
for the resuscitation of the nation's health sector is being
worked out by the Nigerian government, the Guardian newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, tagged "Health Sector Reform Plan Action
(HSRPA)", is aimed at putting the healthcare delivery system
back on a sound footing and ensuring that existing
infrastructure, including those under construction, are
functional.
</P>
<P>
The plan of action is in demonstration of President Olusegun
Obasanjo's commitment to the provision of affordable healthcare
services for all Nigerians.
</P>
<P>
The president has approved a series of reform proposal
following a closed-door meeting between him, stakeholders in the
health sector, and members of the HSRPA committee.
</P>
<P>
Some of the highlights of the proposal include the
establishment of a National Reference Hospital in Abuja;
significant expansion of community health centers; emergency
grants to comprehensively restructure and reactivate secondary
and tertiary hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Others are the strengthening of the National Health Management
 Information System; special focus on immunization and the control
of some endemic diseases; self-sufficiency in vaccine production;
re-structuring of key institutional functions within the
ministry; improving on the welfare and conditions of service of
health workers; and the integration of traditional medical
practice.
</P>
<P>
The reform also features the implementation of the National
Health Insurance Scheme; and the provision of adequate funding,
not less than 11 percent, 25 percent and 30 percent of federal,
state and local governments yearly budgets for the health care
system.
</P>
<P>
It is, however, not yet clear whether the president has
accepted the proposed budgetary provisions relating to the
reform. The president did not accept a budget increase by the
National Assembly in a bid to reduce some of the country's
amassing budget deficit left by former military government.
</P>
<P>
The budgetary allocation for the health sector has in recent
years hovered between one percent and five percent, a far cry
from the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation of 14
percent of the gross national budget of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
However, The newspaper put the proposed revenue for the reform
at about 700 million U.S. dollars, a sizable sum for the country
at a time of economic difficulty.

The essence of the "two states statement" is to separate the
island of Taiwan from the motherland. This has strained cross-

doomed to be unpopular, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to safeguard China's territorial and

However, he also noted that whatever changes come in cross-

<HEADLINE> MOE Approves 45 New Colleges for Vocational Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Education (MOE)
recently approved 45 vocational colleges in a bid to meet the
demands of increasing college enrollment, a MOE official told
Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Among these 45 newly established colleges, 34 are vocational
and technical schools and 11 are non-government vocational
colleges.
</P>
<P>
The official also pointed out that about 100,000 Chinese high
school graduates have entered colleges this autumn to receive non-
government-run vocational education, adding a new element to the
country's educational system.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education has increased enrollment quotas by
100,000 this year for private higher vocational education, and has
given more freedom to some provinces and municipalities in their
enrollment of students, said Ji Baocheng, director of the
Development and Planning Department under the Ministry of
Education.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the new feature of this program is that students
will pay their own tuition fees, and the government will no longer
be responsible for providing jobs for graduates.
</P>
<P>
Non-government-run higher vocational education will train
special technicians and thereby lessen enrollment pressure on high
school graduates, while allowing more freedom to provincial-level
education departments.
</P>
<P>
Universities in China welcomed 2.7 million freshmen last month,
330,000 of whom are a direct result of the Ministry of Education's
efforts to increase college enrollment.

<HEADLINE> Romania Retains Fourth Straight Team Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, China, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Defending champions
Romania overcame a shaky start to claim their fourth consecutive
team title of the Gymnastics World Championships here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Romanians, who took over the lead on their last apparatus
of the uneven bars, scored a winning total of 153.527. Russia
finished second in 153.209 and hosts China came into third with
152.423.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy because we win the title," said Romanian coach
Bitang Maria. "However, we could not forget our mistakes in the
beam. Our gymnasts were just too nervous," she said.
</P>
<P>
Romania stayed only in the fourth after the first apparatus on
the beam, scoring a lower-than-expected 37.786 points.
</P>
<P>
But the Romanians led by world and Olympic champion Simona
Amanar soon calmed down and regained their form. They piled up
their lead in the rest of the competition to capture their fourth
title since 1994, 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
"We did not have big expectation before we came here. We were
lucky," said Romanian head coach Octavian Bellu who has guided his
team to all the four world titles.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine took the fourth place in 152.338 points, followed by
Australia in 150.932 and the United States in 150.213.
</P>
<P>
Four-time vault world champion Amanar fell off the beam but she
snatched an event-high 9.812 points from the floor exercises. Her
teammate Raducan scored 9.800.
</P>
<P>
The Russians wasted their title chance when the 1997 all-around
champion Svetlana Khorkina fell off the beam on their last
rotation for a poor 9.075 points.
</P>
<P>
Russia made a flying start when Khorkina put on a beautiful
floor routine for 9.800, and later she got 9.800 for her uneven
bars outing.
</P>
<P>
The inexperienced Chinese squad suffered big setbacks on their
weakest event on the vaulting horse while all their first three
gymnasts slipped badly on their landings. But thanks to veteran
Liu Xuan and promising star Ling Jie, whose stable routines gave
China the most needed points for the third place. China were just
0.085 points better than the fourth finisher Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
"The results are better than we expected. It was Liu Xuan who
inspired her teammates today," said Chinese team leader Qian Kui.

<HEADLINE> 10 Million Rural Nigerians to Get Potable Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 10 million rural dwellers in
Nigeria will be provided with potable water in the next two years
under a poverty alleviation program, a senior government official
said.
</P>
<P>
Philip Asiodu, chief economic adviser to the president, made
the remarks in capital Abuja at the just-concluded conference on
"Economic and Development Issues in Nigeria" jointly sponsored by
the government, the World Bank and the Development Policy Center.
</P>
<P>
The official newspaper "New Nigerian" Tuesday quoted the
official as saying that 70 percent of Nigerians, majority of them
rural dwellers, have no access to potable drinking water,
electricity and other basic amenities of life.
</P>
<P>
Asiodu attributed the prevalence of several diseases among the
rural people to lack of potable water, adding that studies had
shown that one tenth of Nigerians would not live up to 40 years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the provision of adequate potable water
would eliminate some preventable diseases and improve the life of
the rural people.
</P>
<P>
According to the economic adviser, one of the effective ways of
 alleviating rural poverty in the most populous African country is
"to make agriculture more productive".
</P>
<P>
Under the poverty alleviation program, he said, the Nigerian
government is to build an efficient irrigation network, ensure
availability of fertilizer and other farm inputs to the farmers in
order to boost food production in the country.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the planned re-introduction of commodity
boards was aimed at making them to function as the buyers of last
resort, so that farmers would sell their produce at guaranteed
prices.
</P>
<P>
Asiodu also disclosed that the government was exploring ways of
 providing adequate and cheaper electricity to rural areas so as
to encourage the establishment of small scale rural-based
industries.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China's top scientific research
body today initiated the country's first museum devoted to ape man
and hominid fossils dating back as far as four million years.
</P>
<P>
In commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the discovery of
the first skull of Peking Man at Zhoukoudian, Beijing's
southwestern suburbs, the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) today
opened the Shuhua Museum of Paleoanthropology to the public after

Peking Man, and Lantian anthropoids and ape men in Lufeng.
</P>
<P>
They have also discovered cultural ruins dating back to the

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Acquire Submarines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Malaysian Navy
(RMN) is pursuing its plan to acquire submarines to enhance its
capability to protect the country's waters, Navy Chief Abu Bakar
Abdul Jamal said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to acquire submarines is one of the RMN plans from
now until the year 2010, he told reporters in Kuala Terengganu,
some 455 kilometers northeast of here, according to Bernama news
agency.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition of submarines is included in plans for several
new battle ships to replace old ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We still have in service for example a ship that is 30 years
old and as for the submarines, we are not going to buy big ones,"
he was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plan would depend on government's financial position, he
said, adding since the plan came up in the 1970s, some RMN
personnel had been given training on submarines.
</P>
<P>
But, neither the navy chief nor Bernama said from which country
Malaysia will buy the submarines.

<HEADLINE> HK to Pick up Speed to Boost E-Frastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong plans to speed up
the development of the Internet-based infrastructure in a move to
enhance its competitiveness as an international financial center,
a report released Tuesday showed.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by the Securities and Futures Commission (
SFC), recommends that to keep the leading position of Hong Kong as
an international financial center in terms of risk mitigation,
increased efficiency and cost reduction, Hong Kong should put
together an "e-Frastructure."
</P>
<P>
The e-Frastructure will facilitate the development of e-trading
in securities and derivatives in Hong Kong and the Asia region,
SFC Chairman Andrew Sheng told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said that the e-Frastructure is a web-friendly technology
infrastructure for the securities and derivatives industry that
allows local and global market participants to access the full
spectrum of financial products and services on an open, robust,
secure, scalable, and high performance network.
</P>
<P>
"With implementation of the e-Frastructure, Hong Kong can
aspire to become one of the leading centers for liquidity,
clearing, settlement and risk management in Asia and the portal
for strategic links with global markets in the region," Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
The e-Frastructure includes the components of a single clearing
arrangement for better risk management, end-to-end straight
through processing for improved cost-effectiveness, a scripless
securities market for enhanced efficiency and legal certainty, and
an open, robust, current and scalable technology structure for
local and remote connectivity and high performance.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong already has the best telecommunications
infrastructure to enable the development of e-commerce and e-
trading," added Sheng, who also chairs the Steering Committee on
the Enhancement of the financial Infrastructure (SCEFI) in Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The SCEFI report has been submitted to Financial Secretary
Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, proposing an array of measures to
facilitate and accelerate the implementation of the e-Frastructure.

peripheral products, given the expectation that China will become

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Encourages Cane Sugar Production for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has called on the country to boost cane sugar production
for export and domestic consumption.
</P>
<P>
Chissano made the appeal Monday while speaking at the ceremony
to mark the re-opening of a sugar plant, Maragra Acucar SARL, in
the suburb of the capital Maputo, Mozambique's Noticias newspaper
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government is currently embarking on efforts to
create a good investment environment for sugar production, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government has resorted to such measures as
adjusting the customs duties and limiting sugar import in order to
protect the domestic sugar industry and stimulate its export.
</P>
<P>
According to Chissano, Mozambique produced about 40,000 tons of
cane sugar in 1998.
</P>
<P>
He said over the past two years, the country's sugar output has
boosted by 50 percent and 15,000 new jobs have been created in
this sector.
</P>
<P>
The Maragra plant has invested 60 million U.S. dollars to
facilitate the new production drive, the president said, adding
that a total of 200 million dollars will also be injected in four
other sugar plants for production purpose.
</P>
<P>
The sugar output in the southern African country is estimated
to reach 380,000 tons by 2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique originally had six modern sugar plants, most of
which have been paralyzed as a result of civil wars.
</P>
<P>
About 120,000 tons of sugar is consumed in the country every
year, of which 100,000 tons depends on import and smuggling.

"The assets exchange and new A share issue are the company's
strategic move to facilitate its long-term development," Yin
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"Jingwei will stride for a further expansion of its product
range to become the only enterprise in China that can produce a
full range of textile machinery, thus increasing its
competitiveness in both domestic and international markets," Yin
said.
</P>
<P>
"Its turnover and profits will also be increased as the market
share is further expended to over 50 percent of the domestic
cotton textile machinery market," Yin said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Shitong, vice-chairman and general manager of Jingwei, was
optimistic about the future of the company after the assets
exchange.
</P>
<P>
China's potential entry to the WTO is no doubt to bring about
new opportunities for textile industry, Liu said, adding that fast
growth in textile exports will inevitably cause a large demand of
textile machinery.
</P>
<P>
China's target for the spindle suppression will be reached
before the year 2000, and of the remained 30 million spindles,
some 10 million are products manufactured in 1980s that need to be
replaced, Liu added.

<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Li Ruihuan, chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez here
today.
</P>
<P>
Though far apart in distance, Li said, China and Venezuela
enjoy good relations. "Both of us are developing countries with
the common task of developing our economies and improving the
lives of our peoples," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said, the two countries are making concerted efforts to
safeguard world peace and stability, and push forward the
establishment of a new international political and economic order,
and the growth of bilateral ties has broad prospects.
</P>
<P>
Li also extended gratitude for the consistent support given by
the Venezuelan government to China on such issues as human rights
and China's admission into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
After briefing the guests on China's development during the
past five decades, Li stressed that history tells us that the
revitalization of a nation should depend on the rejuvenation of
the national spirit so that the potential of the people can be
given full play.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, given that a nation wishes to make steady
progress, it should promptly review and examine itself, and
summarize experience. "One should see the achievements scored,
frankly face the errors, in particular the lessons gained from
painful mistakes, review the mistakes, improve the work, and
reform all irrational systems impeding development," he pointed
out.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Population to Reach 33.4m in 2020 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's population is
projected to reach 33.4 million in 2020, when Malaysia targeted to
be a developed nation, from 22.7 million this year, a National
Unity and Social Development Ministry official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's population is increasing at 2.6 percent a year based
on the rate from 1980 to 1991. However, the population growth rate
in the next millennium is expected to drop with the higher
educational level of women.
</P>
<P>
Despite increasing population, the development policies
implemented by the government had succeeded in enhancing the
well-being and quality of life of the people, the ministry's
Parliamentary Secretary G. Palanivel told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysians are able to enjoy a better life thanks to the
various programs implemented by the government, he said, adding
this was evident from several socio-economic indicators like the
infant mortality rate which had dropped from 34.4 deaths per 1,000
births in 1970 to 8.3 last year and the deaths at birth which had
declined from 140 per 1,000 births to only 20 for the same period.
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate also dropped from 49.3 percent in 1970 to 7.6
percent last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has carried out several activities to mark the birth
of the world's sixth billion person Tuesday, including the
drafting of the Strategic population and Development Plan and
Strategic Parenting Plan for the year 2000 to 2015.

<P>
TIANJIN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A wetland nature reserve
covering an area of 18,500 hectares will soon be established at
Guxie Lake in the Dagang District of Tianjin, with the approval of
the local government.
</P>
<P>
This will bring the number of Tianjin's nature reserves to
eight, with a total area of 129,000 hectares, 10.84 percent of the
city's total area.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is the largest coastal city in north China, and Dagang,
on the outskirts of the city, has many wetlands.
</P>
<P>
However, the city's wetland area is decreasing and the
ecological environment deteriorating with the rapid development of
industry.
</P>
<P>
The new nature reserve will focus effort on constructing the
Dagang Reservoir and the Guangang Lake in the near future to
prepare for a larger nature reserve that will include three other
reservoirs by the year 2010.

BUCHAREST, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Bucharest International Fair
(TIB), the most important technical and industrial fair in Romania,
opened here Tuesday, in the presence of President Emil
Constantinescu.
</P>
<P>
The fair gathers 1,231 participants, including 495 foreign
companies from 24 countries. Germany is the largest foreign
exhibitor, with 163 participants, followed by Italy with 87,
Austria with 51 and Hungary with 45.
</P>
<P>
But organizers have noticed that, for the first time, some
large companies, both Romanian and foreign, are not present at the
fair.
</P>
<P>
George Cojocaru, president of the Commerce and Industry Chamber
of Romania and Bucharest, said that "legislative instability in
Romania, despite the attempt to point out the political stability,
led to a reticent attitude of foreign business operators toward
the Romanian market."
</P>
<P>
Another cause of this situation may be lower purchasing power
of the population, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The TIB, admitted into the International Fair Union in 1994, is
the 25th of its kind this year.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Primary School Teachers Continue Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the on-going
nationwide strike by Nigerian primary school teachers vowed to
continue their action unless the Federal Government pays their
salary arrears.
</P>
<P>
Olu Abiola, Secretary-General of the Nigerian Union of Teachers
(NUT), Monday gave the condition while decrying "the government's
insensitivity to teachers' plight", reported the Guardian, a
leading Nigerian newspaper, Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The situation still remains as it is. Nothing has come the way
of response from the appropriate quarters," he said in Ibadan,
capital of Nigeria's south Oyo State.
</P>
<P>
The teachers launched the strike three weeks ago to press for
the payment of the salary arrears. They insist that teachers'
January to March salaries must be paid before they could return
to classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Abiola also advocated for the setting up of a National Teachers
 Registration Council to register and monitor teaching standards
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The country's primary and middle school teachers struck last
June and college teacher struck only recently in demand of higher
salary, posing challenges to Nigeria's new civilian government.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo had earlier asked the country's
teachers to give government time to reform the country's battered
education sector after decades of military mismanagement and
improve teacher's welfare.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Electronics Fair Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's electronics
industry has once again picked up the momentum, as indicated by
the encouraging increase in the number of exhibitors of this year'
s electronics fair which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Electronics Fair, the largest of its kind in Asia,
opened at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center. Also put
on the stage today were two other fairs, the Third Asian
Electronics Fair and the Hong Kong International Lighting Fair.
</P>
<P>
This year's fairs continue to grow and develop, boosted in part
by the recent revival in consumer sentiment and an upturn in
electronics production in the regions, said Allan Wong, chairman
of the Electronics and Electrical Appliances Advisory Committee
under the Hong Kong Trade Development Council.
</P>
<P>
"This was evident by the increasing number of exhibitors at the
fairs," Wong said. More than 1,400 exhibitors from 22 countries
and regions represented their latest high-tech products at the
fairs, according to Wong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's electronics industry is highly regarded in the
world electronics market for its aesthetic design, high product
quality, quick market response and competitive pricing," K. C.
Kwong, secretary for Information Technology and Broadcasting told
the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the industry is still Hong Kong's largest
merchandise export earner, accounting for 31 percent of the total
exports of 53.12 billion U.S. dollars last year, but it has
traditionally relied on the low-tech, low added-value portion of
the market.
</P>
<P>
The fairs will no doubt provide a valuable opportunity for
businessmen, experts and professionals in the industry to share
ideas and do business, said Kwong.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Minister's Visit to Jordan Canceled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A planned visit to Jordan on
Wednesday by Israeli Trade Minister Ran Cohen has been postponed
indefinitely by Jordan to protest Israeli harassment on its
parliamentary delegation in the West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Cohen was to meet his Jordanian counterpart in Amman in the
first round of trade talks between the two countries since the
Israeli Labor government came to power in July, but the visit was
canceled at the request of Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Raouf
al-Rawabdeh.
</P>
<P>
The talks will not be resumed until the Israeli government
officially apologizes for and investigates into the Hebron
incident, said Jordanian officials who demanded not to be named.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian parliamentary delegation headed by Lower House
Speaker Abdul Hadi Majali was forced to receive security checks
by Israeli soldiers, and then attacked by Jewish settlers last
Saturday when they were prepared to visit the Ibrahim Mosque in
the Israeli-controlled part of Hebron in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government has lodged a strong protest over the
alleged harassment of its delegation, saying the incident not only
violated the spirit of peace, but also ran against diplomatic
conventions.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident was one of the few unhappy episodes between
the two countries since they signed a peace treaty in 1994. For
years, Jordan has been actively promoting the peace process
between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The talks scheduled for Wednesday had been expected to touch
upon industrial zones in Jordan and Jordan's complaints on
Israeli barriers on its exports to the Palestinian self-rule
areas.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Israel said Cohen regretted the Jordanian decision
to put off his visit, but said Israeli police had been unable to
handle to Hebron incident for which the Jordanian law makers had
been greeted with spitting and insults.
</P>
<P>
Instead of apologizing, Israeli officials said the incident
would not have occurred if the Jordanian delegation had
coordinated with Israeli authorities before the visit to the
mosque.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Technology Helps Increase China's Agricultural Yield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- With the use of radiation
breeding technology, China now successfully increases agricultural
output value by approximately six billion yuan (723 million US
dollars) every year.
</P>
<P>
According to a report in the Guangming Daily, China has bred
513 strains of transgenic agricultural plants with nuclear
technology, or one quarter of the world's total 2,050 strains.
</P>
<P>
The planted area of radiation-bred crops now makes up some 10
percent of China's total cultivated acreage, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Many high-quality strains with shorter growing period and
resistant to diseases and insect pests were bred with the use of
nuclear radiation technology, which also helps improve the
agricultural environment.
</P>
<P>
China was recognized by the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) as the leading country in nuclear agriculture in the Asia-
Pacific Region last year.
</P>
<P>
A monograph, China's Nuclear Agriculture, compiled by well-
known nuclear physicists and agronomists, was recently published
by the Henan Science and Technology Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
Experts calculate that China's population will reach a peak of
1.6 billion by the year 2030. Assuming China maintains its present
annual grain-consumption level of 400 kg per capita, including
food, feed and industrial use, it will need 640 million tons in
the year 2030 to meet demand.
</P>
<P>
China is now making every effort to develop agriculture to full
capacity in accordance with its natural resources and ecological
conditions to support the well-being of its people.

<HEADLINE> Water Conservancy System to Keep Current: Hydraulics Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Water conservancy projects must
cater to the needs of city growth in China, according to more
than 70 hydraulics experts who gathered in Beijing today from 12
provinces and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The accelerated development of China's cities has made the
backwardness of urban water conservancy system more noticeable,
and frequent flooding, water shortages, and water resources
pollution have all hindered the further improvement of living
standards.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, experts point out that China must increase
allocations for construction, intensify related research, set up
anti-flood security systems, increase the utility rate of rainfall,
and try to ensure a balance between water resources protection and
utility when designing new water conservancy projects in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the total number of cities in China was
672 by the end of last year, 4.4 times that of the 1950s, and the
number of permanent residents in these cities reached 455 million.

<HEADLINE> China's Basic Stand on Global Social Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has put
forward its basic position on global social development in
response to the Copenhagen Declaration and the Program of Action
adopted at the World Summit for Social Development in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Symposium on States, Markets and Social Progress:
Roles and Cooperation of Public and Private Sectors, co-sponsored
by the United Nations and the Chinese government, opened here on
Monday where Chinese organizers presented the National Report on
the Implementation of the Outcome of the World Summit for Social
Development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government acknowledges in the report that a stable
development of the global economy is an important foundation for
social development. Although economic development can not
spontaneously generate social progress, stagnant and retrogressive
economic development will inevitably bring about negative
influences on social development.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the serious financial crisis in many countries not
only has brought about severe damage to the economy of these
countries and their region, but also has affected the world
economy as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The social development of many countries has also been
influenced to various degrees. Safeguarding the development of the
global economy, including the stability of financial markets, is
an obligation of all countries, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The governments of all countries should undertake a major
responsibility in promoting domestic social development, and the
energetic participation of the civil community, including non-
governmental organizations, should be encouraged and fostered.  (

<TEXT>
<P>
The social development strategies and policies of all national
governments, formulated in accordance with their respective
national political systems, economic levels and cultural
traditions, deserve full understanding and endorsement, the report
says.
</P>
<P>
The report acknowledges that poverty eradication should
continue to be considered the most essential social development
issue. Poverty has always been a prime concern of all peoples, in
particular the people of developing countries. However, the
absolute number of the global poor population has not reduced, but
rather is increasing.
</P>
<P>
Until the basic rights to subsistence and development are met,
the poor will remain unable to truly enjoy economic, social and
cultural rights. The existence of huge numbers of poor people
should cause all countries to be aware that global social
development is only beginning.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government acknowledges that international
cooperation for social development should be further strengthened.
The international community should attach greater importance to
the issues facing developing countries, and provide more
assistance in the form of funds and technology.
</P>
<P>
As they formulate their economic, financial and trade policies,
developed countries should take into account the various direct or
indirect unfavorable impacts these policies could have on the
social development of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government takes the position that the impact of
elements such as economic globalization, trade liberalization, and
the innovations in information transmission must be carefully
reviewed in order to enhance their benefits and mitigate their
negative effects, thereby ensuring that the aspirations of all
peoples can be realized.

<HEADLINE> 5th Asia-Pacific Cooperative Ministers'Conference Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING,October 12 (Xinhua) -- The fifth Asia-Pacific
Cooperative Ministers' Conference (APCMC) held its inauguration
ceremony here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao attended the ceremony and
delivered the opening address. "To realize sustainable success in
the 21st century and to undertake glorious tasks for economic
development and social progress, the cooperative movement calls
for the support of the governments, and more importantly, the
continuation of reforms in an effort to enhance its initiatives,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Wen said it is advisable for every country to explore an
approach for cooperative reform based on its own national
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government has always attached great importance to
the cooperative movement," he said, and efforts have been made in
recent years to speed up cooperative reforms.
</P>
<P>
Wen noted that the Chinese government is ready to strengthen
its exchanges and cooperation with countries in the Asia-Pacific
region in the cooperative movement on the basis of equal
consultation, mutual support, and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Bai Lichen, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and
president of the All China Federation of Supply and Marketing
Cooperatives, also attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The cooperative movement is faced with the challenge of
globalization and intensifying competition, and China is facing
greater competition as well, he said. "The only way out for the
cooperative movement is to further promote reforms."
</P>
<P>
Roberto Rodrigues, chairman of the International Cooperative
Alliance (ICA), said this fifth Asia-Pacific Cooperative Ministers
' Conference is by far the largest in terms of attendance and
organization, compared with the previous ones held in Sydney,
Jakarta, Colombo and Chiangmai.
</P>
<P>
"The ICA feels that the Cooperative Ministers' Conference is
not a mere mechanism for interaction between the governments and
cooperative movements. It is more important that it becomes a
workable forum to engender new policy directions and provide
cooperatives with a more enabling environment," Rodrigues said.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 representatives from the Asia-Pacific region,
African and European countries were present at the gathering.

ISLAMABAD, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Tuesday decided to
impose a comprehensive ban on the issuance of licence for
prohibited bore as part of the government's efforts to curb
rampant terrorism.

The minister reaffirmed the government's resolve to take
stringent measures against those elements who "ventured to take

<HEADLINE> Gold Edition of Confucius Presented to UNESCO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- A gold edition of the Analects
of Confucius, the first of its kind, was recently presented to
UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural
Organization), which will conserve it at its Paris headquarters.
</P>
<P>
"It is a marvelous combination of hi-tech and a traditional
classic, and a precious masterpiece of art as well," said Kim
Yersu, a UNESCO representative, as he received the book from
Xinhua Press, the main publisher, in the Great Hall of the People
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Kim said the book will be specially escorted to Paris and
conserved forever in a prominent place at the UNESCO headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Only 2,550 copies of the gold edition have been issued
internationally to commemorate the 2,550th anniversary of the
birth of Confucius, China's ancient philosopher and educator.
</P>
<P>
The volume utilizes the most advanced gold paper printing
technology in China, which will prevent the paper from
deteriorating, and the purity of gold is greater than 99.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some masterworks of calligraphy are also collected in the
volume, including several by Kong Decheng and Kong Demao, 77th
generation lineal descendants of Confucius.
</P>
<P>
The Analects is a true record of the saying of Confucius, and
after 2,000 years the philosophy of Confucianism remains the core
of traditional Chinese culture. It is one of the oldest works of
philosophy in the world.
</P>
<P>
"The publication shows that Chinese people pay great attention
to their inheritance, and conserve works of their traditional
culture, an important attitude for facing the coming century", Kim
said upon receiving the book.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Submit Protest to U.N. Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
submit its protest to the United Nations following the
International Force in East Timor (Interfet) cross-border raid
against an Indonesian border post in East Nusa Tenggara (West
Timor).
</P>
<P>
"Please understand that the protest will be sent to the U.N.,
not to the Australian government which leads the Interfet,"
Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Alatas told reporters here before
attending a cabinet meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Alatas clarified media reports saying that Indonesia will send
its protest against Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian Military (TNI) on Sunday said that a company of
Interfet troops breached the Indonesian border and attacked a
border post near the Montael area. A policeman died and two others
were injured.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia claims that Interfet troops were confused on the
exact location of the border and attacked an Indonesian border
post in the area.
</P>
<P>
Australia claims that their forces were still within East Timor
and that they were shot at first.
</P>
<P>
According to the Antara News Agency, Chief of the TNI Gen.
Wiranto Tuesday has escorted air-borne infantry of Battalion 342
of the elite Strategic Reserve Force to the borderline with East
Timor to secure the region following the cross-border raid against
an Indonesian post.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto said the TNI troops sent to the borderline will carry
out a special task, and not for a combat or other territorial
duty.
</P>
<P>
The special task of the force is to create peace in the area,
seize all weapons brought by pro-integrationist or others, and
conduct a joint patrol with the Interfet in the borderline of East
Nusa Tenggara and East Timor.
</P>
<P>
"We ask the Interfet for a joint patrol, to create peace in
East Timor," Wiranto added.
</P>
<P>
After the short ceremony, Wiranto left Kupang, capital of East
Nusa Tenggara, for a visit to the borderline.

<HEADLINE> Dell Predicts Market Share to More Than Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Dell Computer Corp.
Chairman Michael Dell said Monday that he expects the market share
of the world's number two personal computer maker to double or
even quadruple over the coming years.
</P>
<P>
The company has grown at double or triple the rate of the
industry for several years -- allowing it to recently surpass IBM -
- and is now chasing Compaq Computer Corp., the world's number one
PC maker.
</P>
<P>
Dell said he expected the company to add about 8 billion
dollars in new revenue this year, for a total of about 26 billion
dollars for the year.
</P>
<P>
"We are very profitable in our core hardware business. We have
11 percent market share right now. I think we can grow that to 25
or perhaps 50 percent going out a number of years," Dell told a
technology conference in Orlando, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Recent industry global market share data showed Compaq with 15
percent, Dell at 11 percent, IBM holding 9 percent and Hewlett
Packard Co. at 7 percent. The rest of the market is extremely
fragmented among smaller players.
</P>
<P>
Dell predicted a strong future for PC sales in general and no
change in the basic replacement dynamic in which most customers
replace computers every three years. He said hardware sales will
be fueled by falling prices and increased demand for bandwidth,
which increases a computer's ability to broadcast sound and video
directly from the Internet.
</P>
<P>
He also said that as Internet access expands to such items as
mobile telephones and personal organizers, the demand for PCs will
remain strong.
</P>
<P>
Still, some analysts say Dell is vulnerable to pricing
pressures, especially since its product line focuses mainly on
business PCs and is not as diverse as other companies that sell
lots more computers to home users.

<HEADLINE> China's Procuratorates Undergo Drastic Reshuffle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China has reshuffled the
leadership of 1,023 procuratorates and 839 anti-corruption offices
at county and prefecture levels so far this year in a major effort
to improve the image and efficiency of the nation's prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the Supreme People's Procuratorate, 1,
179 prosecutors were expelled this year after they were found to
be employed illegally or unqualified.
</P>
<P>
These moves were a follow-up to a massive shake-up inside the
procuratorates across the country which began in June 1998 to curb
judicial corruption.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of 1998, China appointed 594 new chiefs and
deputy chiefs of anti-corruption bureaus nationwide at county and
prefecture levels, and 1,332 new presidents and vice-presidents of
county and prefecture procuratorates were installed to fill the
vacancies left by those who had been demoted or retired.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign, all the 20,830 presidents and vice-
presidents of procuratorates and chiefs and deputy chiefs of anti-
corruption bureaus at more than 3,700 county and prefecture
procuratorates were inspected for their political and ideological
quality, work style, self-discipline and honesty, law-enforcement
proficiency level, and the procedures by which they were elected
and appointed. The situation in the departments under their charge
was also investigated.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that prefecture- and county-level
procuratorates make up 99 percent of the total number of
prosecuting bodies in the country, and their prosecutors account
for 93 percent of the nation's total, handling 95 percent of all
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
The leading officials of these bodies play a vital role in
safeguarding justice.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Suffer From Regional Zero Tariff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The manufacturing and
agriculture sectors in Zambia may suffer from the zero tariff to
be implemented by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern
Africa (COMESA) beginning next October.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest issue of the Business Line, a
publication by Zambia Association of Chambers of Commerce and
Industry (ZACCI), Zambia is likely to suffer six percent revenue
loss if it phased tariffs down to zero by October, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The publication said that while the regional integration offers
Zambia immense opportunities to export to the regional market,
most Zambian manufacturers are unlikely to benefit from this
because of the high cost for the manufacturing sector in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"The high inputs cost in Zambia's manufacturing industry will
prove to be a big disincentive to any investment in the industry
by both local and foreign investors," the ZACCI said, adding that
some multi-national companies are likely to shift to countries
like Malawi and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Has 32 Million Fewer People Thanks to Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, October 12 (Xinhua) -- About 32.84 million fewer
people were born and nearly 1.3 trillion yuan saved in Sichuan
Province in southwest China than otherwise would have been the
case, thanks to China's family planning policy over the past 20
years, said a meeting held Monday in the provincial capital of
Chengdu to mark "World Day of Six Billion People."
</P>
<P>
Sichuan now has a population of 85 million, ranking third in
the country. It has made remarkable achievements in controlling
population growth since China began implementing a family planning
policy in 1978.
</P>
<P>
As a result, both Sichuan's birth rate and natural population
growth rate were lower than the national average.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the birth rate in Sichuan dropped from 40.
61 per thousand in the early 1970s to 14.62 per thousand by the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The province's population growth rate declined from 30.3 per
thousand to 7.48 per thousand during the period.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan aims to maintain its population within 87 million at
the end of the century, and within 91 million by the year 2010.
The birth rate and natural population growth rate will drop to 13.
6 per thousand and 6 per thousand respectively by next year.
</P>
<P>
If effective measures to slow down the rapid growth of its
population had not been taken, China now would have 300 million
more people than the current 1.248 billion, according to
population experts.

<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese prosecutors recovered 1.
6 billion yuan for the state and enterprises as a result of the
anti-corruption campaign carried out in the first eight months
this year, sources with the Supreme People's Procuratorate said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that prosecutors across the country
investigated 29,765 Party and government officials involved in 26,
164 cases of bribery, embezzlement and dereliction of duty.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates have been focusing on "major and important"
corruption cases, crimes involving large amounts of money and high-
profile officials, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors also joined law enforcement agencies of public
security departments and courts in cracking down on other criminal
activities endangering social stability and national security.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months, they issued warrants for the arrest
of more than 420,000 criminal suspects and brought 380,000 of them
to court, these figures representing increases of 13.5 percent
and 15.2 percent, respectively, over the corresponding period of

<P>
CANBERRA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Australia is taking the United
States to the World Trade Organization (WTO) over its restrictions
on Australian lamb.
</P>
<P>
AAP quoted Tuesday Australian Trade Minister Mark Vaile as
revealing that negotiations with the United States had failed and
the world trade umpire was the only option.
</P>
<P>
"We are now announcing that we are going to seek a dispute
settlement panel to be set up," Vaile told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In July, the United States imposed a border tax of nine percent
on the first 31.85 million metric tons of Australian lamb imported
and a 40 percent tariff on all shipments above that level.
</P>
<P>
"You can't be a player in the WTO game and be a supporter of
the rules and want to step outside of it when it suits you," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government hoped that the panel will be set up
before the end of October.

<HEADLINE> China's Development Mode A Model: Venezuelan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo
Chavez Frias said here today that China's development mode can be
a model for Venezuela and many other developing nations.
</P>
<P>
The president, who arrived here Sunday on a state visit, said
in his speech at the Sino-Venezuelan Economic and Trade Seminar
that China's fast economic growth over the past years has
demonstrated that its mode of development, formed according to
China's specific national conditions rather than copying Western
models, has been successful.
</P>
<P>
China's mode of development can be a model for many developing
nations, he said, adding that Venezuela can learn from China's
experiences in its own economic construction drive.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Venezuela is building development zones such as that
in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai, and trying to provide more
guarantees for overseas investors, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Chavez urged Chinese entrepreneurs to invest in
his country, specifically in railways, housing, sea ports,
science and technology, and education.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Min, vice-president of the China Council for the
Promotion of International Trade, which organized the seminar,
made a positive response to these remarks.
</P>
<P>
"China hopes that cooperation between the two countries on the
basis of mutual benefit will be expanded," she said. "China
encourages qualified companies to invest in Venezuela and also
hopes more Venezuelan entrepreneurs come to China to explore
business opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Two-way trade volume between the two countries reached 183
million U.S. dollars last year. China's exports to Venezuela were
mainly electronic goods, shoes, textiles and clothing, while the
main imports from Venezuela were iron ore and refined oil.

<HEADLINE> California Signs Bills Against Deceptive Cosmetic Surgeries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 11 (Xinhua) -- California Governor Gray
Davis signed three bills Monday to protect appearance-conscious
Californians from deceptive cosmetic surgery ads and plastic
surgeons.
</P>
<P>
The first bill bans cosmetic surgery ads that use misleading
before-and-after photos or make scientific claims that cannot be
substantiated.
</P>
<P>
The second requires physicians who advertise that they are "
board certified" to specify the source of that certification. It
will prevent a gynecologist, for example, from implying in ads
that he or she is a board-certified cosmetic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
The third will require that a physician should carry
malpractice insurance and have at least one staff member present
when performing plastic surgery in an outpatient facility.
</P>
<P>
Davis vetoed a bill that would allow plastic surgery patients
to check the backgrounds of their surgeons on the Internet, saying
the bill would have been too costly and might have left consumers
with inaccurate information.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted the bills follow a sharp increase in the use of
cosmetic surgery and in the number of doctors who perform the
procedures in their offices or clinics, sometimes with little or
no specialized training.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Headway in Fight Against Prostitution, Gambling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese police have made
headway in their month-long nationwide campaign against
prostitution and gambling, a senior police officer with the
Ministry of Public Security said here today.
</P>
<P>
Police in Beijing focused their attention on such public places
as massage parlors, hair salons, ballrooms, hotels, rented houses,
and the suburban areas of the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that during the campaign, police seized 453
people related to the crime of prostitution, cracked 83 gambling
cases, punished 65 illicit public places, and revoked the licenses
or imposed fines on 19 recreational facilities engaged in illegal
operations.
</P>
<P>
Together with the "campaign against criminals at large" and the
"campaign against criminal rings," police units in south China's
Guangdong Province inspected more than 150,000 recreational
facilities, smashed 780 places engaged in pornography and gambling,
and seized a total of 4,168 criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
In Fuzhou, capital of east China's Fujian Province, police
launched a blitz on a recreational establishment in the Gulou
District, seizing gambling materials and arresting 36 gamblers
with more than 80,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that during the campaign period, public
security bureaus nationwide have also intensified their media
blitz, which frightened criminals, educated ordinary citizens, and
improved the social environment.

<HEADLINE> China's Air Express Market to Double in Five Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China's air express market will
double over the next five years, based on a 20-percent annual
growth rate, according to industry insiders.
</P>
<P>
The demand for international express service is growing fast,
thanks to the development of China's foreign trade and overseas
investment, some experts have noted.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that China's total export value reached 138.7
billion U.S. dollars last year, 17 times that of 1978, while
imports totaled 140.1 billion U.S. dollars, up almost 12 fold. At
the same time, China has been the most attractive developing
country for overseas investment for five consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
Sinotrans-DHL, the first joint-venture express service founded
in 1986, reported a total business volume of 400 million yuan (
about 48 million U.S. dollars) last year, and has set up
affiliates in 16 major cities.
</P>
<P>
Another international express service, FedEx, plans to bring
the number of its weekly cargo flights between China and the
United States up to at least 12, in a bid to meet the need of its
business growth.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by Boeing, global air freight
volume will top 450 billion t/km in 15 years, three times more
than at present, and half of this will go to the express service
sector.

<HEADLINE> New U.S. Studies Detail Lifetime Risks of Obesity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Two studies published this
month in U.S. medical journals quantify for the first time the
substantial health risks of obesity.
</P>
<P>
Both studies examined the individual risks and the benefits
that even a modest amount of weight loss can confer for patients.
</P>
<P>
Obesity is increasingly being viewed as a chronic disease by
medical professionals and has been established by the American
Heart Association as a major, modifiable risk factor for heart
disease, the leading cause of death in the United States.
Approximately 300,000 deaths a year are attributed to obesity.
</P>
<P>
According to Policy Analysis Inc., a health economic research
firm, obesity increases the risk of several major diseases and
that it costs the U.S. healthcare system as much as 50 billion
dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
The studies are based on data relating to a person's degree of
obesity to their risks of five major diseases -- coronary heart
disease, type 2 diabetes, stroke, high blood pressure and high
blood cholesterol. In these studies, obesity was measured in terms
of body mass index (BMI), which is calculated by dividing weight
in kilograms by the square of height in meters.
</P>
<P>
The first study, published in Monday's issue of Archives of
Internal Medicine, reports that persons with high BMIs have higher
lifetime risks of obesity-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
For example, men 45-54 years of age who are moderately obese (
BMI of 32kg/m2) have more than twice the lifetime risk of
developing high blood pressure of non-obese men (BMI of 22.5 kg/m2)
of the same age, and almost three times the risk of developing
type 2 diabetes. Risks are even greater among those who are
severely obese.
</P>
<P>
Published in the October issue of the American Journal of
Public Health, the other study examined the health and economic
benefits of sustained moderate weight loss of 10 percent among
persons who are overweight or obese.
</P>
<P>
The researchers reported that moderate weight loss would
substantially reduce the expected number of years of life that
people would have hypertension, type 2 diabetes and
hypercholesterolemia. The likelihood of developing coronary heart
disease was estimated to be reduced by 12 to 38 cases per 1,000
persons, and that of stroke by one to 13 cases per 1,000.

WELLINGTON, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Forty-seven cases of
tuberculosis have been diagnosed in the Wellington region this
year,
up from 37 at the same time last year, the Evening Post reported
here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wellington-based newspaper, a further 56
people
have been given six-month courses of antibiotics in an attempt to
prevent the disease spreading.

<P>
This year, Wellington has recorded an average 19 cases for
every
100,000 people. This rate is sharply above the national average of
11
cases per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Local health officials fear that overcrowding in impoverished
households is contributing to Wellington's increased tuberculosis
rate.
</P>
<P>
"We're facing a situation where there are a lot of individuals
sleeping in one room," Medical Officer of Health Jane O'Hallahan
was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding makes it difficult to isolate TB patients from
others
and also means groups of families are likely to get the infection,

<HEADLINE> Nepali Carpet Export Grows Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepali woolen carpets export
registered a steady growth in fiscal year 1998/99 due to the
declining controversy over azo dye and child labor, which had
affected the Nepali carpet industry's European market.
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Carpet Industries Association (CCIA),
2.6 million square meters of carpets worth 140 million U.S.
dollars were exported in the fiscal year, an 8-percent growth over
a year ago.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997/98 fiscal year, Nepal exported 2.45 million square
meters of carpets worth 130.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nepal saw an unprecedented decline in carpet export during the
1995/96 fiscal year owing to the azo dye and child labor
controversy compounded by the economic slowdown in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The carpet business accounts for nearly 60 percent of Nepal's
export trade. It occupied first place in Nepal's export a few
years ago but was reduced to second, to the garment industry last
year.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the biggest buyer of Nepalese carpets in terms of
volume while America, Switzerland, Belgium, Austria, the
Netherlands and Britain are other major importers of Nepali
carpets.

<HEADLINE> Oil Price in Thailand Goes Down Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The Petroleum Authority of
Thailand (PTT) Tuesday reduced gasoline and diesel prices by
another 0.3 baht (0.75 U.S. cents) and 0.2 baht (0.5 cents) per
liter respectively due to the decline of crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
Regular and premium gasoline prices has gone down to 13.29 baht
(33.22 cents) and 12.49 baht (31.22 cents) per liter while
high-speed diesel price has fallen to 10.34 baht (25.85 cents) a
liter.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the gasoline price here dropped 0.3 baht (0.75
cents) per liter after a 0.5-baht (1.25-cent) drop in diesel oil
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The continuous decline in prices of oil products should be
attributed to an easing in prices on world markets and the
strengthening of the baht.
</P>
<P>
The fall in crude oil prices has resulted in gasoline and
high-speed diesel prices declining to 23.05 dollars and 22.53
dollars a barrel respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai baht appreciated and stabilized in a range
of 39-40 to the greenback from a 13-month low level of 41.7 in
late September.

The sources said that under the loan scheme for the
rehabilitation of houses, families in receipt of an income between
1,501 to 5,000 rupees (21 to 70 U.S. dollars) per month are
entitled to a loan maximum of 50,000 rupees (698 dollars) while

<HEADLINE> Thai PM Asks Myanmar to Normalize Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to General Than Shwe Monday, Chuan thanked Myanmar
for helping bring a successful end to the siege at the Myanmar
Embassy here and pointed to the constant contact between Thai and
Myanmar authorities then as evidence of close cooperation between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chuan expressed hope that Thai-Myanmar relations would
"progress" according to the path he discussed with General Than
Shwe in Chiang Rai of northern Thailand in March, when the two
prime ministers endorsed plans for joint patrols in the Andaman
Sea as well as cooperation against drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar banned Thai fisherman from its waters and closed
checkpoints along the land border with Thailand after five Myanmar
gunmen seized the Myanmar Embassy here on October 1. Thailand gave
the gunmen safe passage to the Thai-Myanmar border in return for
the safe release of all 89 hostages.
</P>
<P>
Chuan told reporters Monday that he supported a planned trip to
Yangon by Agriculture and Cooperatives Minister Pongpol Adireksarn
to request Myanmar to reopen its waters to Thai fishermen.
</P>
<P>
He hoped talks between Pongpol and his Myanmar counterpart
would restore mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister noted that the ban on Myanmar waters would
force Thai fishermen to turn to Indian or Indonesian waters as
they could not idle for a long time.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that there has been no critical change
to the general policies between the two countries and that it was
normal for the two sides to face some problems sometimes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan has contacted
his Myanmar counterpart to try to reach an understanding with the
Myanmar government.

<HEADLINE> IBM, Nokia to Popularize E-commerce over Wireless Devices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. computer giant IBM and
Finnish Nokia, the world's biggest cell phone maker, Monday
reached an agreement on popularizing E-commerce over wireless
devices connected to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The two companies would work together to develop enterprise
Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) solutions that would allow
customers to extend their E-businesses beyond the personal
computer to a variety of mobile devices.
</P>
<P>
WAP is a new communication standard that allows wireless phones
to connect directly to the Internet. The technology is designed to
try to shrink Internet pages to fit on a handset screen. Nokia
described the technology as "having the Internet in your pocket."
</P>
<P>
"No longer must people be tethered to a PC to access the
Internet," Nokia said, "With a WAP-enabled mobile device, people
will have a simpler, easier and more flexible way to access the
Internet."
</P>
<P>
Mark Bregman, general manager of IBM's pervasive computing
division, said in a statement that WAP is the key ingredient that
will enable a mobile phone instead of a PC to access information
and services on the Internet. "Combining Nokia's leadership in the
wireless space with our expertise in the enterprise, IBM will be
able to quickly provide an expanded range of compelling data
offerings for the mobile Internet," he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, IBM will market and
distribute the Nokia WAP Server software on its PC servers and
license Nokia core WAP technology for integration with other IBM
server platforms.
</P>
<P>
The alliance between IBM and Nokia comes at a time when on-line
players are battling to bring their services to wireless devices
such as cell phones. Last week, Amazon said its customers will be
able to purchase items from any of its on-line stores using 3Com's
new Palm VII handheld wireless device.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Cambodia are seeking
cooperation with Laos to open up the Indochinese peninsula for
three-country packaged eco-tours via water, rail and road routes,
the local English daily Vietnam News reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The commitment was reached during talks held in Hanoi on Monday
between Vietnam Tourism Administration General Director Vo Thi
Thang and Cambodian Tourism Minister Veng Sereivuth who is on a
four-day visit here.
</P>
<P>
The Mekong River, which flows through all three countries, is
particularly singled out for upstream sail where visitors can
travel from Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City to Cambodia's Phnom Penh,
to the Lao capital of Vientiane and Thailand and then up through
Myanmar to China's Yunnan province.
</P>
<P>
Measures were agreed upon here on Monday to be undertaken to
boost cross-border trips between Vietnam and Cambodia and they
include simplified procedures for crossing the border at land and
river checkpoints in the provinces of Tay Ninh and An Giang as
well as along the Mekong River.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese and Cambodian tourist officials said both countries
would devise specific cooperation in organizing cross-country
tours and cross-border trips along the Mekong River.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the talks agreed that tourism development in
Vietnam and Cambodia increased markedly since the two countries
signed a tourism treaty in September 1995 and particularly after
the signing of a tourism protocol for 1999-2000 on December 13
last year.

<HEADLINE> Ince May Delay Operation for England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Paul Ince is set to delay a
hernia operation to help England's bid to reach the Euro 2000
finals if he is called up by Kevin Keegan for next month's play-
offs.
</P>
<P>
The Middlesbrough midfielder is resigned to having surgery to
cure a problem which has dogged him this season, despite his
resurgence in form, since his controversial summer move from
Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
But Ince is determined to be available for the two-legged
battle on November 13 and 17 after winning his first cap under
Kevin Keegan in Sunday's friendly international against Belgium at
the Stadium Of Light.
</P>
<P>
With David Batty suspended because of his sending-off in Poland
last month, the need for Ince to be available for the holding role
in midfield is even more significant.
</P>
<P>
Few will forget the sight of the head-bandaged Ince in Rome two
years ago, helping England to draw with Italy and reach the 1998
World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Ince admitted: "Sometimes with a hernia problem you can go on
until the end of the season, sometimes you have to have it
operated on so it won't get any worse.
</P>
<P>
"This problem has been there for some time and it is a question
now of playing in the Premiership and seeing how it goes.
</P>
<P>
"But if I am in the England squad it looks as if I will have to
postpone the operation. If I am called up, I won't miss out, don'
t worry about that!
</P>
<P>
"Everyone knows how much I love playing for my country and I
would love to be involved in the play-offs. The Sweden result
gave me a massive lift because I now might have that chance.
</P>
<P>
"I love a challenge and when the backs are up against the wall.
I like to be there at the front when it's a do or die like the
game in Rome and now the play-offs will be similar," he said.

<HEADLINE> Wenger Calls for Ruddock Punishment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger
said Monday that he was shocked at suggestions that the Football
Association would hit Patrick Vieira with a five-match ban for
spitting at West Ham's Neil Ruddock.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that tough-guy Ruddock, who he clearly believed
provoked Vieira into his reaction, should also be punished by the
FA.
</P>
<P>
Vieira was charged with misconduct by the FA after former
Tottenham and Liverpool defender Ruddock revealed that the French
international had spat in his face when he raced to the scene of
the incident in which the Arsenal player was sent off for a second
bookable foul on striker Paolo di Canio.
</P>
<P>
Video evidence confirmed Vieira's actions and it was later
revealed that police had also sent the FA a report of him using
threatening behaviour to an officer in the players' tunnel as he
walked off the field.
</P>
<P>
But now Wenger intends to supply his own video evidence of the
provocation he claims Vieira endured throughout the match - and
particularly the 40-yard rush Ruddock made towards him when
referee Mike Reed flourished the red card - when he accompanies
his player at a personal hearing to answer the charge.
</P>
<P>
And Wenger insisted: "We know that Patrick will be punished on
video evidence but why don't the people who provoke him get
punished on the same evidence? Is it because they just talk
nicely in the next day's newspapers?
</P>
<P>
"When I read that Ruddock says he was playing the nice guy and
just went over to calm Patrick down, I find it quite shocking.
</P>
<P>
"What he said after the game shocked me even more than what he
did on the field because he must think that people are stupid.
</P>
<P>
"What Patrick did was wrong and everybody accepts that,
including him. He spat and that was too big a reaction. He has
apologised and doesn't say he's not guilty - and he knows he has
to master his own behaviour. Only he can do that.
</P>
<P>
"But I just think at some stage anybody would have reacted to
what was happening to him and we've got to find some way to punish
the provocateurs as well. If the FA punish people who react they
have to surely punish those who provoke. That is only fair. If
the FA suspend him for five matches I would be shocked," he said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Customs Foil Smuggling Attempt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Customs officers in Gongbei,
south China's Guangdong Province, recently foiled an attempt to
smuggle four million pirated CDs and a batch of electronic
equipment in what could be the biggest case of its kind in the
country since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
According to customs sources, two suspicious ships sailed close
to the customs' sea area on the night of October 1, China's
National Day. Police stopped them and ordered a search of the
vessels, which led to the seizure of the CDs, along with computer
disk drives, DVD players and stereos -- all items in high demand
in China, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects confessed that the illegal shipment was loaded
from a Hong Kong ship in the waters close by that metropolitan,
and that they had been waiting for an opportunity to slip inland
undetected.
</P>
<P>
The total value of the smuggled goods has not been determined
and the case remains under investigation.

<HEADLINE> China Has Great Potential in Chain-Store Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign chain-store operations
are shifting their focus to the Chinese market because of its
great commercial opportunities, said Isao Nakauchi, a manager with
the Daiei Company, Japan's retail giant.
</P>
<P>
He said that investigations show that China has made
substantial progress in the last two decades since its
implementation of the reform and opening up policy, and its
economic growth rate for this year is estimated at seven percent.
Chain stores will have great opportunities in China as the
commercial sector further develops in order to support industrial
growth.
</P>
<P>
Daiei has established chain stores in Shanghai and Dalian since
the first branch in Tianjin opened in 1995, and it plans to
increase the number of its stores in north China's Tianjin
Municipality from eight to 15 to satisfy the needs of the market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Administration of Internal Trade show
sustained growth of chain-store business in China, and combined
sales volume of chain stores was 60 billion yuan (about 7.2
billion U.S. dollars) last year.
</P>
<P>
Chain stores dealing in household appliances and
pharmaceuticals are increasing, with their number now exceeding 1,
000 throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Along with Japan's Daiei, China's preferential policies have
attracted chains from the United States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Domestic chains are also becoming competitive, with Tianjin's
Home World Group Ltd. having set up 12 stores in Tianjin, Shaanxi
and Hebei provinces in the last two years, and sales volume this
year is estimated to exceed 950 million yuan.

<HEADLINE> China Intensifies Fight Against Copyright Abuses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, October 12 (Xinhua) -- China is cementing efforts of
local copyright groups to combat piracy, as part of a nationwide
campaign to clamp down copyright abuses.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the State Press and Publication Administration,
who attended a book fair in this capital of central Hunan Province,
said that techniques used to forge publications are becoming more
sophisticated and these activities are also becoming more covert.
</P>
<P>
"We must incorporate the efforts of local copyright groups to
combat piracy cases," one official said.
</P>
<P>
Many copyright unions have been formed in the cities of
Shanghai and Chongqing, and the provinces of Sichuan, Guangdong,
and Jiangsu.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 people have joined these unions voluntarily,
including writers, book publishers and business people in the art
industry and computer software companies. They are usually led by
officials from the press administration, public security, the
industry and commerce department, and courts and cultural bureaus.
</P>
<P>
A group in Shanghai alone dealt with some 200 cases last year,
retrieving 120,000 yuan for its members.
</P>
<P>
China unveiled a plan to set up a national anti-piracy union in
1997. Also, small groups have been quickly forming in the coastal
provinces. More inland provinces and regions such as Hunan in
central China are also now joining in these efforts.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Online Energy Industry Powered by Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, October 11 (Xinhua) -- As online energy trade flows
through Internet marketplaces, new market forces will reshape the
natural gas and electricity industries, a U.S. research firm reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Forrester Research predicted that by 2004, electronic marketplaces
in the United States will propel online energy sales to 266 billion
U.S. dollars by bringing about higher levels of efficiency in
wholesale markets and enabling energy buyers to understand market data
on a deeper level.
</P>
<P>
Forrester's report "The Surge of Online Energy" found that the
ability of energy buyers and sellers to find each other on the
Internet is radically changing long-established patterns of energy
trade. In this new environment, the report said, price competition
will supplant trade based on phone calls and personal relationships,
pitting providers against each other in online bidding wars. To gain
market share, providers will be forced to expand their geographic
trading arenas, introduce new product-service bundles and employ
innovative marketing and branding strategies.
</P>
<P>
According to Forrester, new marketplace models will dominate online
trade, including exchanges, aggregators, auction and bid system. The
majority of online energy trade will executed via exchanges, because
they fulfill buy-and-sell needs for online industry players. Sales
passing through exchanges will surge to 171 billion dollars in 2004 by
providing wholesalers -- the largest sector in energy -- with
real-time market information and quick fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
Bid systems will win big in the commercial and industrial sectors,
Forrester said, as large companies increasingly use the Internet to
automate their request for proposal and request for quote processes.
By 2004, Forrester expects bid systems to capture 16.5 percent of
online business trade.
</P>
<P>
Although there is little e-commerce activity in retail energy
markets today, Forrester said, the deregulation of electricity will
pave the way for aggregators to streamline purchase by concentrating
many energy catalogs for buyer groups. Forrester expects aggregators
to account for 25 billion dollars in 2004, or 11 percent of total
retail business trade.
</P>
<P>
Forrester's report is based on interviews with 50 firms that
already buy or sell natural gas over the Internet, in addition to
technology vendors, energy intermediaries, energy experts and
regulators. Two-thirds of the companies interviewed indicated that
they were lured online by the availability of real-time market-pricing
information.

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Says Regulatory Flexibility Is Needed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan told bankers Monday that regulators are
weighing changes to deal with the huge banks that are being formed
by mergers and that could hurt the economy if they fail.
</P>
<P>
"Significant changes are in the pipeline" in banking
supervision by U.S. regulators and their foreign counterparts,
Greenspan said in a speech.
</P>
<P>
He said that the changes point to a "multitrack approach" to
oversight of banks, since they vary significantly in size,
business strategy and penchant for risk.
</P>
<P>
"Even among the largest banks, no two institutions have exactly
the same risk profiles, risk controls or organizational and
management structure," Greenspan said in the speech to the
American Bankers Association's annual convention in Phoenix.
Copies of his speech to the banking industry's biggest trade group
were released in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan pointed out that regulatory flexibility is especially
needed in the case of megabanks resulting from mergers which, he
said, "create the potential for unusually large systemic risks in
the national and international economy should they fail."
</P>
<P>
Regulators such as the Fed must walk a line between exercising
adequate oversight of big banks and regulating them excessively in
a way that smothers innovation and competition, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
"Such a heavier hand would also blunt the ability of U.S. banks
to respond to crisis events," Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
An outline of the changes being considered by U.S. and foreign
regulators was released for public comment in June by an
international group of bank supervisors based in Basel,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Big bank mergers have been occurring at a rapid pace in the
United States, with recent multibillion-dollar consolidations
including those in which banking giant Citicorp merged with
brokerage-insurer Travelers Group; NationsBank Corp. and
BankAmerica Corp. combined; and Banc One Corp. and First Chicago
joined.
</P>
<P>
Critics, including consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader and
some lawmakers, have asserted that the mergers have increased the
likelihood of future taxpayer bailouts of big financial
institutions that fail.
</P>
<P>
In September, the Federal Reserve warned banks and directed its
examiners to watch for signs that risky bank loans are piling up.

<HEADLINE> Northwest China Province Boosts Resources Exploitation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The economic growth of Qinghai
Province will depend on exploitation of natural resources,
provincial acting governor Zhao Leji said here recently.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai is one of northwest China's resource-rich provinces. A
276-kilometer section of river between the Longyang and Sigou
gorges on the upper reaches of the Yellow River contains enough
water to generate 36 billion kwh of electricity.
</P>
<P>
The 250,000-square-kilometer Qaidam Basin on the Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau, one of the three biggest basins in China, has a proven
gas reserve of 31 billion cubic meters, scores of proven minerals
and a dotting of saltwater lakes which have an estimated value of
12 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
These rich natural resources were untouched before New China
was founded in 1949.
</P>
<P>
A surge of resource exploitation began in the 1960s and 70s. By
1978, the state had allocated three billion yuan to build chemical,
metallurgical, energy and building material production bases, Zhao
said.
</P>
<P>
Economic reforms have accelerated the pace of resource
development in Qinghai. In the past two decades, the province
invested 36.4 billion yuan for the building of 8,000 projects, 85
percent of which relate to resource development.
</P>
<P>
At Qaidam Basin, preparations have been made to build a coal
processing center with an annual output of 300,000 tons, as well
as a thermal power project and a low-sodium halide stone works.
</P>
<P>
As the point of origin for such main rivers as the Yangtze,
Yellow and Lancang, Qinghai will take measures to protect plants
and the environment at the upper reaches of these rivers, Zhao
said.
</P>
<P>
The acting governor predicted that by the 21st Century, the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau will become a new tourist attraction with
its beautiful scenery.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 12 (Xinhua) -- The headquarters for
overseeing the relocation and construction of the Baiyun Airport
in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, has opened.
</P>
<P>
A plan to relocate and build the airport was approved by the
State Council last month. The new airport will be built in
several stages and with designs provided by Parsons Corp. and URS
Greiner Corp, two U.S. firms, and the Guangdong Provincial
Architectural Design Institute.
</P>
<P>
According to local sources, the new airport will be situated in
the city of Huadu, which is under the jurisdiction of Guangzhou,
and will cover an area of 1,456 hectares, about four times the
area of the existing airport.
</P>
<P>
The existing facility is the country's busiest and has long
been overburdened by increasing numbers of passengers and cargo
volume.
</P>
<P>
At an estimated total cost of 18.83 billion yuan (about 2.3
billion U.S. dollars), the new airport is scheduled to be finished
in 2010. It will be able to handle 25 million arrivals and
departures, and one million tons of cargo annually.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> 1,000-Year-Old Oil-Saving Lamp Excavated in China's Three Gorges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 12 (Xinhua)-- An oil-saving lamp dating back
to the Song Dynasty (960-1279 A.D.) was recently excavated in the
Three Gorges region, showing that Chinese people realized the
importance of saving energy some 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Beneath a small porcelain oil plate, the porcelain lamp has an
empty interlayer, leaving a tiny hole on the surface to add water.
</P>
<P>
Lu You, a well-known Chinese poet of the Song Dynasty, wrote a
poem explaining that ordinary oil lamps dry very fast, parched
directly by the flame; while having an interlining inside to hold
water, the oil-saving lamp saves nearly half of the oil.
</P>
<P>
The lamp was discovered by the Beijing Cultural Relics
Institute in the Shituo tomb at the Three Gorges, one of ancient
China's pottery and porcelain producing areas.
</P>
<P>
Oil-saving lamps appeared in the Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.)
and were quite popular in the succeeding Song Dynasty, according
to an archeologist from the institute.
</P>
<P>
Other works of pottery and porcelain showing profound
techniques, along with a piece of tile used in soothsaying were
also unearthed from the tomb.
</P>
<P>
"It required a high mastery of firing skills to make such
articles at that time," one expert said, "and we can see the
intelligence of the ancient Chinese people reflected in them."

<P>
SHENZHEN, October 12 (Xinhua) -- For many people in Shenzhen,
one of China's most modern cities, a computer is as important as
the three fundamental elements of life: sunshine, air and water,
as they move into a digital world.
</P>
<P>
A new poll conducted by the Shenzhen Statistics and Information
Bureau shows 40 percent of the households in the south China city,
one of China's Special Economic Zones, have a computer, and some
experts say this figure could be as high as 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Today, if you want to find a job in an insurance company,
hospital, factory, or government department in the city, computer
skills are a must.
</P>
<P>
An employee with a computer software company said, "I can't
even imagine what my life would be if I don't have a computer at
hand." By this, he means not only at his job, but in his spare
time as well, largely spent surfing the Internet, sending and
receiving e-mail, and reading stock bulletins and other economic
information.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen people are enjoying more conveniences brought about by
computer technology than people in other Chinese cities. They don'
t have a lot of colorful credit cards swelling their pockets. They
only need one card and it can be used at any banks' ATM and POS (
point of sales) machines, as the city has China's first financial
network.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen Stock Exchange is among the first group of
exchanges in the world to trade without paperwork, as it is all
done automatically, by computers.

<HEADLINE> EU, S.Africa Compromise On Wine Deal For Trade Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 11 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) foreign
ministers said Monday in a statement at their Luxemburg meeting
that EU and South Africa will continue to work together on the
Wines and Spirits Agreement after the two sides signed their
overall trade pact that will phase out tariffs on about 90 percent
of their exports.
</P>
<P>
The two sides removed last obstacle from French objection to
the general agreement of the trade pact. Both sides ageed to
settle their dispute on wines and spirits by the end of this
month.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin and EU
Commissioner Poul Nielson signed the accord in Pretoria government
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
OriginaLly, the long-awaited agreement was planned to be signed
by South African President Thabo Mbeki and Finnish President
Martti Ahtisaari, whose country is holding the current EU
presidency. But the Finnish president canceled his trip to
Pretoria on Sunday, leaving signing of the agreement in doubt
because the two sides still have a row over how to use the names
of "port" and "sherry".
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed in March to ratify the overall trade pact
with South Africa, which would open up European markets to South
African products. But Spain and Portugal, backed by France, Greece
and Italy, demanded recently written guarantee that South Africa
will phase out the terms on its fortified wines.
</P>
<P>
The southern EU members are insisting in the names port and
sherry can only be used for drinks originating from particular
areas of Portugal and Spain respectively. They also said they
would not sign the trade agreement unless their terms could be met
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The signing was rescued, but France has "placed reserve" on the
conclusion of the deal because it was not satisfied with the
"naming compromise", a French diplomat said in Luxemburg meeting.
</P>
<P>
President Mbeki welcomed the breakthrough, but criticized the
attitude of the rich world toward the poor. The European bloc and
its South African partner have reportedly agreed to make their
final deal on the Wines and Spirits Agreement on October 31.

It is high time to act towards stepping up commercial exchanges
with China, Plesu said, adding, People's Republic of China "has
been always extremely cordial and willing to help Romania".

<HEADLINE> Accident Deaths Reach 46 in El Salvador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Forty-six people, among
them several children, died Monday after a public transport bus
fell into a river crossing San Salvador's northern outskirts.
</P>
<P>
Reports from San Salvador said that this accident is one of the
most regrettable that happened this year in this Central American
country. Besides, there were several injured.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened on the road going from the capital city
of San Salvador to Quezaltepeque city, in La Libetad department,
when the bus had a mechanical failure in its steering whereby it
left the roadway on a turning and fell into the river.
</P>
<P>
A Civil National Police spokesman said that during the first
half of this year, over 10,000 traffic accidents took place in El
Salvador, while in 1998 there were 20,000 with a loss of 924
Salvadoreans.
</P>
<P>
The same source expects that by the end of this year, the
amount will be far below that of 1998 although it is obvious there
are possibilities of achieving the same quantity.

<HEADLINE> KGB Spy Dossier Made Public in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 11 (Xinhua) -- A dossier covering KGB activities
in Italy during the Cold War made public here Monday disclosed a
list of names of Italians who allegedly spied for the Soviets and
charted the attempts of late Soviet leaders to discredit the
powerful Italian Communist Party of the time and its leader,
Enrico Berlinguer.
</P>
<P>
The dossier comes from a mass of material smuggled to the West
by Vasili Mitrokhin, an archivist for the Soviet secret service,
who defected in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The documents were given to Italian authorities during the
premiership of Romano Prodi from 1996 to 1998 but their existence
only became known a few weeks ago with the publication in Britain
of a book based on Mitrokhin's personal archive.
</P>
<P>
The release of the 645-page dossier by a parliamentary
commission Monday disclosed names such as Armando Cossutta, the
head of the Italian Communists in the ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
The journalists, politicians and others named in the documents
represent virtually the full spectrum of public life.
</P>
<P>
When the Mitrokhin affair began to stir up controversy, the
Italian government handed the file over to Rome prosecutors, who
began a probe to see if any of the material indicated crimes had
been committed.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government said it could not release the material
until this investigation was over and that to do so would mean
subjecting people mentioned in the file to a trial by media and
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
But last Sunday, in what seemed to be an about-face in policy,
Deputy Premier Sergio Mattarella announced the dossier would be
put in the hands of parliament's massacres and terrorist crimes
commission.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed relentless pressure from the
opposition and from within the government's own majority to make
the material public.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Monday, the Rome public prosecutor's office,
responsible for dispatching the documents to Parliament, said it
had not placed any secrecy stamp on any of the documents it had
examined.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, European Commission President Romano
Prodi once again denied having been informed of the Mitrokhin
Archive, when he was premier and information from the KGB employee
was forwarded to Italy by British intelligence.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Prodi said in Brussels that the EU executive
president had nothing to add to what had already been said.
</P>
<P>
All Prodi knew of, the spokesman reiterated, were vague
references that British intelligence had been investigating a spy
network.

<HEADLINE> Italy Seeks U.S. Help to Curb Artifacts Import </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 11 (Xinhua) -- Italy is asking the United States
to help curb imports of artifacts from classical civilizations
which are often stolen and exported illegally.
</P>
<P>
An Italian petition has been submitted to the U.S. Department
of State's Cultural Property Advisory Committee (CPAC) which will
hold a public hearing on the request Tuesday for archeologists,
museums, art dealers and others to have their say.
</P>
<P>
Reporting the development, the Washington Post said Italian
police recovered 122,940 stolen artifacts in 1993-97, estimated to
be just a fraction of the total acquired illegally.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the Italian art theft squad has seized 32,000
antiquities from three warehouses alone, the U.S. newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Post also said, "In 1992, U.S. customs seized 230 Etruscan
and Apulian vases from a Los Angeles antiquities dealer, some of
which still had dirt clinging to them."
</P>
<P>
The owner of a New York gallery was reported to have estimated
the value of Mediterranean antiquities sold annually in the U.S.
at 50 million U.S. dollars.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton,
acknowledging the Senate will reject a nuclear test ban treaty,
Monday formally asked the Senate to postpone a vote on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made the request in a letter to the Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott and Minority Leader Tom Daschle.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing there would be no enough votes for the approval of
the treaty, Clinton said: "Accordingly, I request that you
postpone consideration of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on the
Senate floor."
</P>
<P>
White House Spokesman David Leavy urged the Senate to "take
into account the larger national interest."
</P>
<P>
"It would be irresponsible for the president to limit his tools
in dealing with something as sensitive as nuclear testing," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Senate needs two-thirds majority, or 67 votes, to approve
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on nuclear weapons have been
signed by 154 countries and ratified by 23 countries since it was
open to signature in 1996. But it takes effect only after it gets
approval from all the 44 members of the Conference on Disarmament.
